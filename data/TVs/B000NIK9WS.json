Excellent picture for a 720 (1080s are better but much more$$).Has 2 HDM inputs!! DO NOT buy a TV with fewer than two HDMI inputs. Later you will inevitably end up with at least a DVD & Satellite if not other HDMI devices. One great feature is that one of the HDMI inputs has a separate analog audio input. Normally, the HDMI carries its own audio, but if you run a Dolby 5.1 amp with center channel, you can run the center channel directly to the TV as your center channel with the HDMI analog audio input!! The TV has excellent speakers with great Bass & Treble controls and two 10watt amps.All the cords run down the sides of the back of the TV so they do not get smashed against the wall. This means you can purchase a $20 HDMI cable from Belkin @ WalMart instead of an $80 HDMI MonsterCable at BestBuy. Furthermore, the side access makes it easy to access your hookups while the TV is against the wall.The TV does have PIP (Picture in Picture) which is not always present on entry level HD TVs. Unfortunately, it seems that only the VGA (PC input) works as a second source for PIP. By the way, the VGA looks phenomenal with your PC. Run the VGA at 1280x768 or whatever has closest proportions to 16:9. I hookup my notebook computer and let my digital pictures play on the TV on my wall... just gorgeous. Also, work on your PC while using a small PIP window to watch TV (but you will not be able to use the HDMI in PIP so will need to use alternate inputs on the TV to accomplish this).This TV has a Great remote control to boot.In summary: Compared to other TVs in the same price range:1) Better Picture2) More inputs/outputs3) More features4) Better remoteEXCELLENT PURCHASE!!", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Worked great..but then something happened", "Author": "Joe C.", "ReviewID": "R2ON51SD4G997H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from a big box retailer in July of 2007. I chose this one after looking at the picture and color compared with the others in the store and I was very impressed. It worked get for the first six months. Easy to set up and to use with all my different components (dvd, vcr, sound system, cablebox).However, six months later, I have been having some horrible problems with it. It scrambles and has some horrible color problems (whites are showing up pink and blown out details). I started calling Westinghouse after the first of the year and got the run around. I had the cable company out to check the signal, switched out 2 cable boxes, and did the factory reset a couple of hundred times. It took calling every week for a month to get them working on this. Finally, I was able to get them to send me a box and now its been sitting with them to make whatever decision they are going to make.Although this may have been a rare problem with my particular tv, I feel the way in which it was being dealt with was inexcusable. If a product has a warranty, it should be dealt with in a swift manner. This is a lot of money to be messing with. I would look elsewhere for a better company who respects their customers.", "Date": "February 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV!", "Author": "Tyler V.

The picture is simply beautiful, whether you're viewing something in HD or not.  When we were picking it out, we compared this TV with other models with the same size, and our choice was obvious.  Everything priced above this model was priced WAY above it, because those models were the top brands like Sony and Sharp.  Everything priced similarly to this model, or below, had clearly lower picture quality.We have used this TV for over a month and have experienced no problems whatever.  The \"overfill\" mode for non-HD TV stations works great, and the sound quality is what you would expect for built-in TV speakers.  I honestly have no complaints about this TV!If you don't want to fork over the money for the top brands but want a high-quality TV whose picture looks pretty much the same as the top brands, you should give this Westinghouse TV some serious thought.", "Date": "November 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Broken out of the box", "Author": "Chris Hoy", "ReviewID": "R3B6FAOSQJ4L3H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased this from an online retailer and as soon as we hooked it up it wouldn't work.

You do realize that this television has a 1 year limited warranty on defects. Westinghouse will repair it for free provided you registered the tv  when you bought it and you have your reciept.This television is great. I've not been happier with any purchase of a television. The only downside is that standard cable looks grainy but thats to be expected with an HDTV. It has a standard tuner for standard cable/airwave broadcast but the television was designed for HD so its an acceptable trade off. I don't use a cable box in my room where this tv is  and it picks up a ton of channels, standard and digital. HD is absolutely incredible on this set. I am finding details in movies that i've never seen before on a SDTV. I.E. dust flakes, powder dust flying in the air when people put on medical gloves, stuff like that. I have to say that the only real thing I don't like is that the bass and treble controls don't go through when you're using the external audio but it still sounds good.The other day my sound went out on the tv for the external audio. I was a bit concerned but I just unplugged the TV for about a minute and plugged it back in and it works fine. If you're planning on doing a firmware update, make sure that your USB flash drive is compatible with the tv. I tried to do it but the tv didn't even see the drive.All in all i would recommend this tv to anyone who wants a lower priced 32\" LCD TV thats packed full of features. This definately won't break the bank for the quality and performance you get. I paid $499 for this TV from Best Buy online and even at its full price now, its worth it.", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Horrible product, worse customer service", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R125L2EDRF5ZIP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV from a big retail store in Nov 2007, several months later, the TV was having problems with the sound coming through the HDMI cable. I called westinghouse, and after trying to troubleshoot over the phone, they agreed to set up a repair order. Got it shipped to them, did not get it back for several weeks. Then technician calls and says he has the TV, but he doesn't see anything wrong with it. He finally says he can't duplicate the problem, so just sends it back.2 months later, October 2008 (1 month before the warranty expires), I call them again due to more problems, this time with picture freezing (not the cable company's problem). They refuse to send it in because it MUST be something else wrong with the TV.Now, it is October 30th, they still refuse to repair the tv, and the color seems to be going out.I don't have any other option but to try to get them to fix it, or just run it over with my car and leave it for the trash collector.Frustrating to pay $550 for a TV, then have it break under manufacturer's warranty, then to have the manufacturer refuse to fix it.", "Date": "October 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Poor Quality, Bad Service", "Author": "D. Cooper", "ReviewID": "R3JNCNJEDREYI7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like a lot of people I've been reading about, I started having problems with my Westinghouse LCD television only a few months after purchasing it.  Unfortunately, my problems are sporadic and, not noticing them when viewing cable television, I assumed that this problem was caused by the other input source I used on it (a video game console).  I had that unit serviced twice, and by the time I realized that the problem was with the television and not the input source, the unit was out of warranty by about 3 months.  Despite having documentation to show that my problems began only a few months after buying their product, their customer disservice department basically told me I was up poop creek.  I guess it was crazy of me to expect a $600 television to work properly for a whole year and a half.  Thanks for nothing, Westinghouse!  Next time, I'll go with Toshiba or Samsung, and I would encourage anyone else to do the same.ProsLots of inputs, is still semi-functional a whole 15 months after purchase.ConsDiscolored static on areas of uniform color (esp. white and red), framerate drops (bad for gaming), customer service is unresponsive and will allegedly make you pay out of your own pocket for any service they grudgingly provide, other customers have reported sets going dead entirely.", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Warning!

Sometimes, these just represent one single data point, and aren't that relevant. My experience, however, leads me to believe that Westinghouse KNOWS that this television is very prone to failure, and I hope others will appreciate hearing about it.I bought this item on sale and got a great deal, and for six months it worked brilliantly. Then, it simply stopped coming on. Westinghouse's warranty service first sent me to a local repair shop, which was unable to fix the tv because Westinghouse, unlike ANY OTHER MANUFACTURER, does not directly sell parts, even to THEIR OWN LICENSED WARRANTY REPAIR TECHS. I then had to ship the TV back to Westinghouse AT MY OWN EXPENSE (one fourth the cost of the TV!) and have been waiting over four weeks for them to do anything with it. They tell me that this model is so prone to failure that they do not have the inventory to replace them!Had I just spent the money I have now spent on shipping I could have gotten a higher quality TV, or even a larger one. That is what I suggest you do. This television WILL FAIL.

I think it may have even been on sale so we really got a deal... or so we thought. Unfortunately, our problems with the tv started almost immediately.Soon after purchasing it, we experienced the following:1. The tv would not turn on. Sometimes it would turn on and then immediately shut itself off.2. A black line developed down the length of the screen. This was not burn-in from watching standard aspect ratio as the line was more toward the center. Eventually the line went away.Then, after about a year of use (conveniently after the warantee ran out), the tv started blooming - white backgrounds developed a bluish-tint. The tv would self-correct after a while, but we are now at the point where it's a constant problem and the picture is practically unwatchable.We have checked everything - the video game components, cable box, dvd player, etc. We have replaced cords and adjusted color/brightness/sharpness levels. The tv is simply defective and now we are faced with shelling out another $800+ for a tv that will actually work.Please do not buy this product.

Then within a month ago it started changing the channel.  I didn't think a thing of it, I assumed that the DVD player wasn't plugged in as firmly as it should be, and it only did it while it was paused.  Then one day I was watching it and suddenly the screen went blank.  This was still around the same time as the other, so again, I didn't think a whole lot of it, it only happened the one time and by changing the channel and back again it worked fine.  Then within the last few days I noticed a horrible smell in my room.  I had my kids with me helping me look for the source of the smell, I thought maybe they had spilled something like pipe cleaner or something from my husband's toolbox.  The smell was exclusively upstairs and clearly by my bedroom.  The smell finally went away, with a lot of gagging on my part and I didn't think of it until later when I complained to my husband, by now I figured that the air conditioner had lost it's freon.  Which he told me was impossible since it doesn't hold that much and it was still getting cold.  That night, when I went to go to bed, where my husband was watching TV, the smell was back.  I complained to him but he told me I was nuts that he couldn't smell anything.  I put up with the smell, again gagging and still didn't get the connection.  Within a day or so the picture started going out, though I thought that the cords weren't plugged in right.  Last night my husband worked it over and we couldn't get the picture back for more than 10 seconds.  We had to bring a different TV from downstairs.  I loved this TV and to make a long story short, don't waste your money, it can't be repaired and you are stuck with a big paperweight that makes you mad when you look at it.  Now we have taken the kids' TV they use for their Wii until we can save up to buy another TV for our room, which is the only place we watch.  Very disappointed and I can promise I won't waste any more money on another Westinghouse.  They used to be a brand name that you can trust, clearly this isn't the case anymore.  I'm not going to waste my time arguing with them over the phone, they know about the problem, if it were under warranty they would barely help me then and since it isn't I won't get anywhere.

Freeman \"Vertigo, Inc.\"", "ReviewID": "R12HDTISTQU1R8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Most of the time anyway. This was my first HDTV, I purchased it a year and a half ago through Ubid for only 300 (including tax). For an HDTV even today is quite damn cheap. Sadly, I looked not only on Ubid and here but everywhere else as well and haven't seen such a good deal since...For a bargain HDTV the color saturation and clarity isn't too shabby. The viewing angles from my perspective are around 140 degrees. Settings are pretty standard, nothing special. The built-in scanner is quirky though, especially with comcast service. You can get a handful of HD channels but the channels under 720p get too hazy to watch.If you are planning on using it for your PC as well make sure:1) Your video card is HDTV compatable (HDMI slot) so that you can get the most out the signal quality and2) leave your settings for color set to factory default and set it through your video card. Don't worry about it effecting your TV or video watching experience, each input you switch to has its own profile, so you can set different settings for tv, console, ect.Some video cards have the spdif jumper you can attach to your motherboard so that sound goes though your HDMI cable as well but don't bother with it. I found the sound quality to be much better if you just do a direct optical connection from your PC to your home theater system.I love this TV; I have my pc, DVD home theater, and PS3 using it (and although PS3 claims to be full HD it is only 720 so this works fine). In a small apartment this HDTV is ideal, as well as any space-saver.I do have one major con to point out: I don't know if the recent commenters were just lucky or are working for the company but I have to agree with the tens of comments towards the back about all the issues you have (or will have) with this HDTV or any other HDTV Westinghouse makes. Since the name has been sold finally oversees (as someone already pointed out here) customer service and overall product quality has gone though the crapper. If it breaks, just scrap it for parts, you will save a lot of money in the process. After having mine for just an over 1.5 years I'm now just starting to get an occasional \"pink distortion over white and dark blue over blue\" as what many here have said before. It comes and goes once in a blue moon and when it does it doesn't last long so it doesn't bother me that much.In conclusion, any Westinghouse HDTV has a bargain price for a bargain quality. If you can get one of these for under $400 new then go for it, seriously. Major reason is that even though these are LCD tvs and not plasmas (why in the hell anyone wants to spend thousands of dollars for something that burns out as fast as a candle is beyond me) their lamps still have a short life span as compared to the \"never goes away\" CRTs. Over 80% of consumers who purchase electronics of any form end up upgrading around five years after it was purchase, so unless you are someone who has and likes to keep what you have around for many years then go out and get something nicer (but still do research on the item before you buy!). For everyone else this is perfect. Yeah, there is a chance you can get stuck with a real lemon that craps on you as soon as you open the box but the odds are safely low enough to take the risk. These should last long enough before you replace it with something better, and if not you didn't lose your life savings in it >.>", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "caution: do not buy a westinghouse tv!", "Author": "Rebecca Lieb", "ReviewID": "R2OV4BX4MADD1Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "hen my first westinghouse flatscreen tv lost audio, it took over 9 weeks to get a replacement refurb unit. the new unit promptly lost the picture.in the interim, the company has switched to a non-human farce of a \"customer support\" system. it's a telephone message that promises a response to email inquiries within 24 hours. well, i'm on 5 days and counting - no response to the web form, email or phone messages.still waiting for that response from westinghouse, as well as for tv #3.there are other brands out there, folks. don't go with westinghouse if you know what's good for you. it would be worth twice what i paid for the tv to have avoided dealing with westinghouse customer service, not to mention a whole series of non-functional televisions.", "Date": "May 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Junk Poor Quality!!!", "Author": "gusaboy \"gusaboy\"", "ReviewID": "R3FDFKD4I95Z5J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased our TV on 2/22/08 and today is 4/6/09.

I tested all TV menu functions with five different brands of DVD players (including a Toshiba HD-DVD player and a Samsung dual-format HD player) and all possible player setting combinations with no luck overcoming this issue.The TV was returned (again at my $50 expense) and replaced with another unit with EXACTLY the same image-stretching issue.  Multiple calls to Westinghouse Support (you cannot talk to anyone from the real technical side) and another replacement (this time shipping at W'house expense) and I got another \"certified refurbished\" set that had the same image-stretching issue but also experienced catastrophic failure within 15 minutes of first use.Via email I finally got W'house Support to admit that the set CANNOT display 4:3 source material via HDMI without stretching it because, \"The TV is functioning in the way that the software programmers designed it to function.  HDMI is a high definition input source, and is designed to be used with high definition output devices.  The native format for almost all HD programming is 16:9, which is native aspect ratio for the LCD screen.\"When I pointed out that HD DVD players DO play standard resolution DVDs with upscaling and that LOTS of programming (several Star Trek series and other TV series included) is available ONLY in 4:3 format I got no further replies.Is someone in W'house living in a cave?Bottom line is that the \"updated\" firmware was rewritten to resolve two \"issues\" and had a fallout of intelligence.  I was told that, \"Consumers didn't like the graphical controls and strongly requested plain text (suuuure) and that the auto-detect/auto-on feature was turning the set on in the middle of the night for some satellite service subscribers (not my DirecTV)\" - but they also made the brilliant decision to make it impossible to watch 4:3 DVD programming in its proper format via HDMI input.I have not tested it yet with my DirecTV HD connection (since I am without a TV for the fourth time), but I am wiling to bet that it cannot properly display any of the 4:3 source programming broadcast at times on the HD channels.I have had some very nice Customer Support folks try to help me and I cannot fault their courtesy - but as someone who started working with computers in 1971, spent 10 years as a Navy Airborne Electronic Warfare Officer and documented software development their tech side falls woefully short.Since buying the first set I have had almost no use of the product because multiple sets have either been enroute to or from W'house and EACH TIME the exchange takes palce W'house gives itself up to 21 days for an exchange.  Multiply 4 x 21 and add 10 days each time for shipping both ways - that means since MAY the set has been traveling or being exchanged for a total of 124 days - over four months - almost 60% of the time since I bought it - NOT hanging from my wall being watched.My recommendation is that NO ONE buy any Westinghouse LCD TV unless and until you can test and ensure that the set is capable of accurately displaying 4:3 sources via HDMI without stretching.  Maybe some models have escaped the oversight of the \"software programmers\" who evidently do not test their programming to see if it applies in the real world.W'house shows no interest in resolving this issue or even discussing it intelligently, stopping communication when the error in firmware was identified.Bottom line is - DO NOT BUY WESTINGHOUSE.", "Date": "December 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV Recomend Highly", "Author": "G.

First, I could hear a buzzing/humming/beeping sound coming from the TV even if the speakers were off or muted.  Nothing the tech support told me to do helped at all.  Then, out of nowhere I find a transparent box with a white number 2 in the upper right corner of the display.  It won't go away, won't turn off no matter what I do.  I really loved the picture and sound on this TV.  I am very disappointed with this model.  I'm sending it back.  New rating = 1 Star.  Go with a different model.I just purchased a refurbished Westinghouse SK-32H240S 32\" 720P LCD TV on Feb 11th, 2009.  This is my second refurbished Westinghouse and third Westinghouse total.  I bought a brand new Westinghouse LTV-32w1 in 2005.  I also bought a refurbished Westinghouse SK-32H590D in November 2008.  They are all functioning flawlessly and have completely exceeded all my expectations.  I often say, either I am lucky or Westinghouse has a bad reputation.  Who knows, maybe both are true.  I keep waiting to have a bad experience with Westinghouse but so far, no complaints whatsoever.The SK-32H240S is a great bargain.  I purchased it for $369 with free shipping.  As I said this is my 2nd refurbished Westinghouse and just like my previous refurb it was in near mint condition.  After a very careful inspection I found the bottom of the base had a tiny little ding and the serial number plate on the back had a scratch accross it but being that neither are visible at all I was very pleased.  In typical Westinghouse fashion it is not the prettiest designed LCD out there with a matte black finish and a lighter tone bottom piece.  Not the thinnest or lightest either.  But where it lacks in exterior physical appearance it more than makes up in function.  The picture is great. My Mom just bought a Samsung 32\" LN32A450 which was $200 more than this TV and the first thing she said when she came over was, \"why does your picture look better than mine?\"  I was thinking the same thing but would never have pointed that out.  Also, the sound is fantastic.  Most of the current LCD TV's, like my Mom's Samsung LN32A450, employ downward or backward firing 5 Watt speakers due to their slim bezel design.  The SK-32H240S features front firing 10 Watt speakers.  The Westinghouse blows away the Samsung in the speaker department.  I also have a 42\" LG slim bezel that can't out volume any of my Westinghouse 32\" LCD's.  So again, form follows function.  It may not be the most attractive LCD TV but it gets the job done.PROS:  Great picture, same/better features/specs as the \"high end\" brands for hundreds less.  Picture in picture.  Great speakers.  It's my 3rd Westinghouse LCD TV without a single problem!!!  Not even one dead pixel between them.CONS:  New firmware 2.01.019 has a rather boring text based menu.  No Electronic Program Guide in firmware version 2.01.019.  Color took a while to manually adjust to my speicific approval, was tinted green by default.  Can't turn off the blue LED power light on the front of the TV (my SK-32H590D has an option in the menu to disable the LED light).In summary, the Westinghouse SK-32H240S is a great bargain 32\" LCD TV.  The only cons are just nitpicky things unrelated to it's actual performance.  I really love this, and my other Westinghouse LCD TV's. Despite Westinghouse's somewhat questionable reputation, they have always worked flawlessly for me.  I definitely recommend this TV to anyone who wants to save a couple hundred dollars while still getting maximum performance in a 32\" 720P LCD TV.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worked for 2 years...", "Author": "CD Carr", "ReviewID": "R191JKW34X0EP2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just thought I'd add to the voices of caution...I own an older version of this TV (LTV-32w6HD)and it worked for just over 2 years.

Yes the t.v.s' low prices can be considered a warning to stay away but they shouldn't be. When we just chalk a $700 t.v. that is defective up to \"getting what we pay for\", we create a climate where not only do we expect to get ripped off, Westinghouse is vindicated in a round about way. A defective t.v. is not worth $700 dollars. So no I did not get what I paid for. At any price a product should be expected to function properly for  a reasonable amount of time. If a manufacturer or retail outlet knows that it will not, it should not be available for sale.Saying \"well I guess I got what I paid for\" is tantamount to saying if Westinghouse or any other manufacturer sales wares at a reasonable price, they do not have a responsibility to provide a functioning product.Unfortunately the only way to hold them accountable at this point is to keep spreading the word in hopes that consumers will become wary enough of their products the business folds.

The TV was great for about a month and then the picture just went crazy. Everything was covered in neon green static.
