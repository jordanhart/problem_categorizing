It truly looks like you are looking out a window when viewing HD channels. Standard definition channels look fine, also.

I kept checking the sound on every channel to see if it said mono, because it sure didn't sound like stereo to me.  I went through both manuals, trying to find some adjustment I could make to improve the picture and the sound.  I even went out and bought the suggested S video cable, but I couldn't see any difference in the picture once I plugged it in.But all that changed as soon as I popped in my Batman Begins DVD.Wow.  This monitor is the bomb.  The sound is indeed stereo with rich tones and good separation.  The picture is great with fantastic resolution, more than I hoped for.I wish that the print in the user's manual were actually large enough for me to read with my 40+ year old eyes and that the onscreen menu were easier to maneuver.  But it's clear to me that this thing was designed for watching DVDs in widescreen and at that, it absolutely excels.  TV people look a bit squat and the sound is more like flat mono than stereo.  Who needs television anyway?  If you use this equipment for watching DVDs only, it will be well worth the price you paid for it.

Maybe ......", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R77AGS18EHA85", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, this is probably a good \"value\" considering it's currently low price point ($699-$799 + Rebates), and it has a decent array of inputs, and it comes right out of the box ready to go (stand is already attached). but that's where it all comes to a subtle stop.I'll explain. After a lightning storm took out a 5 year old analog 32\" 'square' TV, i said \"yep, it's time for another widescreen HDTV\" . We own a 55\" Hitachi Ultravision Projection and it has awesome written all over it. Maybe I set my expectation a little high on the LCD, even though I never expected an LCD to look near as good as the Hitachi.My direction was pointing to CRT (conventional picture tube) Widescreens. 30\" from Sony (KVH-30hs420), Panasonic (Tau), Toshiba (30hf85) and Philips (30pw911od). Where this is where I wish I hand ended up, instead of beganLCD are incapable of reproducing images as clear as CRT's . period.there's just something about LCD's that have always bugged me. the Black's are never 'black' , action creates artifacting (blocks of pixels), graphic and text looks overprocessed. This Olevia has some of those (but not all) and a few of its own)Pros and Cons------------Pros :Nice footprint30 lbs - easily mountable on a wallInputs for days : VGA / DVI / Component x2 / S-Video x 2 / Composite x 2Clean and usable interfacethe new IDEA technology works ... sortaHD broadcasts look great but not awesomehooked up a Dell laptop via VGA and it looked real nice, but....Cons :VGA is locked at 16:9Nice footprint , but the foot isn't removable (so I've read)would look nice on a wall, if you could remove the stand (foot)the inputs are nice to have lots of, anything Composite (Yellow) is sure to look badthe added EQ and Surround modes are nifty, but some of the Surrounds are uselessthe remote is too simple, but it does allow you to access everything (which isn't much)-except you cannot change aspect ratio with remotenon-HD Letterboxed programs are tiny. the letterboxing bars are almost as big as the imagethere is a line of time code viweable at the top of the screen.-there is no way of stretching it out-the only way to change aspects is to go into the menu-there should be an \"Aspect\" button on the remote-in the video menu there are options to adjust the screen vertically and horizontally-these options are \"shaded\" and are not accessible by the user. VGA use only - that sux15:9 is an awkward ratio. Some say you can't notice it, but you can - if you look-16:9 mode effectively crops 1/2 inch of both the top and bottom of the screenIDEA technology kinda does what it says, but I didn't see it as dramatic as it's shownThere is no way to stretch out a 4:3 image to 16:9-your aspect options are FULL /4:3/ 16:9 / Panoramic-what I had to do was go into a secret menu on my Motorola Cable Box-when asks : 4:3 Override ? - you have to select STRETCH. I had override set to 480pSettings from the factory need adjusting-if you are unfamiliar with adjusting video you might get an undesirable pictureFinal Thoughts -I wanted to like this LCD. I thought maybe someone had finally got an LCD to look good with TV broadcasts, and while Syntax-Olevia is probably doing a better job then anyone else in the range, they still haven't got it where an A/V enthusiast is going to be pleased with the final results.Pictures are still to 'washed' for my liking, and watching any action or sports has got to be a struggle. Static or normal images look great, but once things start to move or speed up they lose it.Using my little cable box trick (which everyone should now) solves some problems but complicates others. 1st -the trick. with your cable box OFF, select MENU on the front of the box (not the remote), you should get a grey tech screen. it'll ask you the display type and 480i override options as well as Component outputI've met quite a few people who had their component outs to 480i and the screen type to 4:3 , whic would solve some issues.Type - 16:9Output - 1080i (or 720p)480i Override - StretchBut to this point, I cannot remove the line of code at the top of the screen----called Syntax Support (1-888-Syntax-8) nice quick response \"We usually only see that w/ DVI connections\"so why do i see it on Component ? \"Maybe it's the cable box\"So, i checked some channels. It seems that once you get passed chanel 70 the line goes away, which is about where the DigiCable starts.too bad we have SciFi , Spike, Comedy, Nickelodeon, etc.. under that thresholdi'm also not encouraged by this being a DVI observed anamolyI'm going to give this monitor 1 week. If I haven't figured it out, it's going backwhich will be a shame because I really wanted to like this settoo bad I started out looking at CRT's whose images are much sharperbut for someone who just has to have there TV mounted on a wallor wants both a TV and a PC monitor, they won't find a better LCD at a better pricePaid - $699 w/$100 Rebate = ($599) September 1, 2005well worth the money. Syntax makes a quality product in the Olevia lineI started to give this a 3, but I will give it a 4 and consider that the code line is a product of the Cable Box, however, if you can adjust picture orientation in VGA, you should be able to do the same in DVI and ComponentI'll also take into account that LCD's aren't capable of being as clear as CRT. Having said that, this is one of the better pictures I've ever seen on an LCD; and by far the best for $700", "Date": "August 31, 2005"}, {"Title": "I'm pleased with it!", "Author": "AbeStreet", "ReviewID": "R2ISRBU15V3C91", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The purchase of the LT26HVE 26 represented our families first venture into the world of flat screen television.  We have, over the past few years, explored the flat screen market and always found the price of a nice sized television to be the biggest obstacle.  Well, when we found this television for below $700 we figured now was the time to take the plunge.  We were concerned about purchasing a television from a company we had never heard of until the sales rep explained to us why this set was as good as many name brand televisions.  The sales rep actually took the time to point out the pros and cons.  I usually don't pay much attention to greedy sales reps, but this guy really seemed more concerned with making sure we understood what we were purchasing than with making sure we purchased any old television.Anyway, here are a list of the pro's and cons.Pros1. Light weight.  I usually get a good work out hauling around our 27 inch and 32 inch tube televisions, by comparison, the  LT26HVE 26 seemed as light as a feather.  My lower back loves the television more than the rest of my body.2. Easy hook up.  Like many people I shun reading the manuals, at least with this television I didn't need it for the installation of the various cables.3. The on screen menu options are fairly easy to understand and follow.4. The DVD picture is good.  Our cable pictures are about the same as our tube pictures.  We don't have HDTV yet and so I can't blame the television for not improving our cable image.5. I'm pleased with the sound.  I should mention that this television is in our bedroom and so we don't play it with the volume up that loud.6. I don't want to beat a dead horse but the price is really good.  I guess I'm a little cheap, because it's going to take one heck of salesmen to get me to spend a Grand or more on a television.7. The picture is still pretty clear when not viewing the screen while directly in front of it.8. This television comes equipped to handle just about any kind of connection you may have.  I doubt I'll use the television for a computer monitor or to play games on but at least I have the option.  It's the first television I've been able to use with an S Cable connection for the DVD player.Cons1. Screen burn out may be a problem.  I prefer to watch shows and movies that are shown in the 4:3 aspect ratio in that ratio.  I don't like stretching the image to accommodate a wider aspect ratio.  I've been warned that the reduced image may cause the cropping lines to be burned into the screen over time.  I guess some newer televisions come with a feature that slowly shifts the cropped screen from side to side so that screen burnout can be avoided.  I don't believe this television has that feature.2. There is no \"Sleep\" function on the remote.  For me this is a big \"con.\"  I'm used to hopping into bed and tapping the sleep button to set the television to shut off within a half hour.  Now I have to flip through the menu options and set the television to shut off at a specific time.  I also have to adjust the time to 24 hour (military) time.  Seems kind of slow and outdated to me.  I haven't purchased a television within the last fifteen years that didn't have a \"Sleep\" button.3. Call me crazy but I kind of like a tube picture.  I know LCD's are all the rage these days but I think my tube televisions are richer in color than LCD's?  Also, my eyes get a little sore after staring at this LCD.  It may just be me but I think LCD's are harder on the eyes.In the end this television has more pros than cons.

SD is usually unwatchable on a highdef screen.  I have watched and enjoyed quite a few baseball games on this set.Sound:The speakers that are part of the TV have adequate sound,  I don't have it hooked up to a home theater.XBOX:I had to tweak the contrast/brightness but afterwards it looks and plays great.

I guess if you are only using it for a PC monitor, DVD (haven't tried it), and HDTV only then the other reviews may be accurate.  BUT if you plan to use it for SDTV viewing (the number of HDTV channels offered through cable and satellite are still low) then this TV is not for you.I returned it and found a Sony KLV-S23A10 for $877 locally in central NJ.  The Sony is 100% better at displaying SDTV and HDTV than this thing.  Your safer buying a 1st tier manu. (Sony, Pioneer, Sharp, panasonic) than the low end of the market.One more thing.

My main concern with \"tube\" TV's ultimately was space, and so I researched some less-expensive LCD's and settled on the 26\" Olevia.I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the picture, particularly in HDTV.  Now I'm no expert regarding the performance of various comparable units, but I've found this TV to more than satisfy my goals of upgrading my modest home entertainment system without breaking my budget.My only negative comment relates to sound quality, which I consider fair to poor. Regardless,  I am running sound through my home entertainment system so that issue is irrelevant for me, but possibly not for others.One suggestion, if you go comparison shopping at big box stores like Best Buy you are likely to be drawn to 32\" and larger LCD TV's.

I only have a standard cable connection and when I hooked this TV up to it using the antenna connection, I had the following problems:-The color depth would sometimes diminish, i.e., the picture would only have a couple of shades of each color and also appear grainy.-As I understood the manual, when the input is standard 4:3 (as I get through my cable), then selecting 16:9 would zoom in, preserving the aspect ration.  Unfortunately the 16:9 did not preserve the aspect ration, but stretched the image horizontally, leaving blank lines above and below the picture.  It behaved the same as the \"panoramic\" mode.I figured it wasn't worth the headache to resolve problems since I could just go back to my old 25\" tube TV and not have any problems - a clear picture with great color all the time, and no aspect ratio distortion.I did not hook it up to my DVD player or an HDTV receiver.

Just don't expect this TV to look great unless you have an HD cable box.I have nothing new to add, but I've noticed a lot of people complaining about the blue light on the power button. The light can be bright and the TV's in our bedroom which made it hard to sleep, so what I did was take a tiny strip of black electrical tape and covered the tip of the power button. Problem solved, no more blue light. The strip of tape is tiny and you can't even see it because everything is black anyway. Don't let the light keep you from buying this TV because it's easy to fix like I did, and you won't find a better price on an LCD TV of this quality and size.Also, people here are saying this TV doesn't work with a universal remote. Not true. All you have to do is enter the code for RCA, YAMAHA, LG, or Philips television (it's posted on their web site).

Kirsten", "ReviewID": "RZ80B2CISDDOA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Did quite a bit of research on LCD and Plasma TVs.  Wanted to be able to use as a computer monitor also.  Believe me, anyone into electronics and specs and having half normal intelligence on using settings can get this TV to work beautifully!!!  Seeing the prices on other LCDs, plasmas and \"rear projection\" TVs, a bit of advise - save your money and be confident in purchasing this \"very\" reasonably priced Syntax Olevia.  Yes, the company has only been in business for a couple of years, but doing research, they are now the 3rd highest rated in LCDs. Reviews in many electronics magazines recommend highly.  Pretty good for a new company!  As for using for a monitor - only a 6 ft. cable comes with the set.  Make sure you spend the extra money and invest into a high-end cable, e.g. the Belkin Pro Series High Integrity VGA/SVGA replacement monitor cable.  Try not to use an extension - go for a m/m replacement cable.  Most stores, e.g. Staples, etc. do not know lower end cables are not recommended for monitors larger then 17-19\". This High Integrity is used for larger TV/Monitors - over 17-19\".  As for adding speakers, etc., again - use high-end cables!  Regarding remote - programmed my cable remote to run the system.  Only need Syntax remote to adjust settings.  Can program ANY remote to control this LCD.  Am debating whether to purchase another, maybe larger, before pricing goes up.  Syntax knows they have a GOOD PRODUCT.  You won't be sorry.  Only reason so reasonably priced is to get their product out there to show what they've got.  Good strategy!  Another bit of info - worked with Bose since their inception.  If you respect the Bose systems, take the advise from someone who's worked with electronics engineers since the 1960's.

My logic is this: if all LCDs have a life to them, then why drop loads of money on something that you know will eventually die?  Not a cent will be wasted on this TV - if you can stand a few minor inconveniences.  For one thing, if you have the backlight set to anything below 100%, the TV makes a buzzing, humming sound (which is mostly drowned out by the fan on my HTPC :-P).  The remote that I got likes to act up as well - sometimes it works, other times it doesn't.  The contrast is excellent, although the blacks aren't really pure black, and you can have some wicked backlight patterns if you don't adjust your settings properly.

I'm used to a big monitor since I burned out my 6-year-old 21\" CRT.  I was a little worried about how this would perform based upon some of the reviews but am happy to report that it works excellently in practice. I have two computers connected, one with the DVI port and one with the VGA port. I've set both graphics cards to run at the native 1280 x 768 resolution with excellent results. The display will actually interpolate a number of resolutions (from 640x480 to 1280x1280). At first I was concerned that the VGA output was cut-off at one side, but after reading the manual discovered that the \"Auto\" button on the remote automatically detects the extents of the video input and adjusts the display in a snap.There are a myriad of options for personalizing the display and color temperatures to your tastes.  HD Broadcast output looks outstanding.A couple things detract from this, but aren't really big negatives because of the economical price.  These are the somewhat odd (15:9) aspect ratio which makes very narrow letterboxing around standard HDTV or WS movie content. The second thing is the desktop stand which seems like it could be a little sturdier (metal instead of plastic would have been nice).", "Date": "July 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great LCD", "Author": "Tobin T. Bradley \"fuzzytolerance\"", "ReviewID": "RKCANLGFEDTM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this LCD for a couple of weeks, and I have to say it has done everything I could throw at it extremely well.I had it running straight coax cable, which yields a fair picture (which is what I get generally from straight-up cable).  Running from the S-video off of an Adelphia cable box gives a noticably better picture.  I would rate the SV output from the cable box as very good to excellent (probalby depending on whether the signal from the box is true digital or analog converted to digital).  As I don't have HD from cable yet, I can't comment on that.I do, however, have HD 1080i coming from my Xbox (component video HD adapter), and that looks spectacular.  I think there were a couple of times in Doom III where I physically ducked.  Gaming with this thing is excellent.I'm also running the VGA output from my PC in to it at 1280x768 (what it does natively - if you do other resolutions, expect some compression/expansion and some loss in picture quality).  It looks every bit as good as the Dell 17\" LCD it was replacing, and a heck of a lot bigger to boot (26\" at 1280x768 is freaking huge).DVD's look great too.  I've run s-video from my cheap DVD player, and it looked great, and I've played DVD's on my computer fullscreen and it looked great as well.  I'd be interested to see if one of those up-converting DVD players make any difference, but as it is DVD's look teriffic.The PIP options are very nice.  You can take any of the inputs and PIP them, so you can have your computer running and TV in a window or vice versa.  You can also do a split screen, though both sides will be a bit compressed, so don't expect great picture quality there.The only knock I would give it is the remote is a bit spartan.  You have to do a lot of toggling around to do some things they could have made a button for.  For example, to get the PIP you want you may have to hit the View button several times and the Swap button once or twice.  Rather than having a button for each AV input, you pull up a menu on the screen and toggle around for a bit to change sources.Despite the remote, for everything it does extremely well, the vast array of inputs, and the overall design and picture quality, I have to give it five stars.

If you plan to use this as a monitor, be sure you can set it back a few feet on your desk. It does produce some heat if it is kept too close. I doubt I will ever be able to use a small monitor again. DVD playback is excellent. It is great to finally be rid of those dreaded \"black bars\" around all of my widescreen DVD's.

I note that their BBB score is now a `D'.Original review (12/12/05): Too good to be true? I plugged it into a 2-slot electrical outlet. (Such ungrounded electrical outlets are common in older homes.) Careful! My unit had 120 volts on the coaxial (cable) input. Accidentally, I touched the cable to my stereo case, and it had a HUGE spark. It must have enough current to give a dangerous shock.After one-half a day of calling (12/12/05), I finally was able to talk with Miguel. He said I had a grounding problem. Eventually, their engineer, Joe, returned my call. Joe said that 120 volts on the chassis was not a defect. Although, he would not accept the unit as a return, he thought it was a good idea to return it to Amazon. Joe indicated that the unit must be grounded, and it would not be uncommon for an ungrounded unit to have 120 volts on the chassis.Appliances should never produce 120 volts on the chassis, even if the (center) ground post is removed. (Read for yourself; search for \"how stuff works 2 and 3 prong plugs\".)  Apparently, the unit has a \"hot\" wire touching the chassis. It seems the Joe (or Syntax) does not want to admit to a defect in the product.I recommend that you do NOT purchase the product unless you have a grounded 3-prong electrical outlet.Additionally, I recommend you consider their customer service. Call Syntax. See how long it takes to talk to a human. I called for one-half a day. They have an odd answer system. Even if you choose to \"talk to the operator\", you will have to leave a message. Eventually, I did speak to Miguel. Then, Joe called me. However, it took all day. (I first called at 8:00 PST; finally, Joe called me at 3:15 PST.)It's too bad. The unit seems to have good color. The sounds is a bit odd, but can be configured. It does not have good reception.

The picture looks a bit \"washed out\" and doesn't perform well with fast moving images. I really wanted to like this TV. If not for the price then for the looks but after sitting in front of it for a few hours and playing some games on it, I have to send it back and use my old Tube TV till I find a new one...I gave it a 3 star rating only because it's still an ok TV for someone who just wants a TV. I need a new TV for some high quality projects and the picture wasn't sharp enough to do it for me.", "Date": "December 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Olevia TV", "Author": "Jess I.

I don't know where they got the comparison screens in their advertising, but the actual screen on my TV is very blurry, the color and contrast are nearly impossible to configure, and fast-motion imagery is choppy. Olevia Syntax has only been around for a few years--since 2003. And it seems like a fly-by-night outfit. They are making a big splash by dumping cheaper units and flooding the market with product that is only passably good at suspiciously low prices. But don't let the media frenzy fool you. This is a case where you really do get what you pay for (actually less). To top it off, customer service is extraordinarily inept. Rebates are not honored, and when you complain they ignore you. I wish I had gotten my TV from a reputable company that would not make outrageous claims and promises and then not stand behind its products or programs. It would have cost a little more, but when you're spending this much on a TV, what's a few more bucks to get something good?", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "26 Cinema-Style Widescreen Aspect Ratio\nHDTV Display Ready (480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i) when used with an optional tuner and antenna or with HD service from your Cable or DSS carrier\n750 - 1 Contrast Ratio\nWXGA 1280 x 768 Native Resolution\nHigh Brightness 700 cd/m2", "Name": "Syntax Olevia LT26HVE 26-Inch HD-Ready Flat-Panel LCD TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512S3RWSQWL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0007R8YGI"}}
