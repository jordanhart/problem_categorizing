Reardon", "ReviewID": "R21E8QWKHEOY4Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched for a flat-screen tv for a couple of months, and finally chose the 4665. I chose the size of the TV based on my room, and decided 50 was too big and 42 too small. This left me without a decision on plasma vs lcd, which was ok with me. Plasma has more basic issues, and going LCD was not a sacrifice - except I had yet to see a LCD with black blacks, so I was not sure what I would see in the 46\" range.As for price range, I decided that I was going to buy the tv that I was happiest with. It was not that I have unlimited budget, just that I wanted to make sure that I would going to be completely satisfied with a 2-3k purchase. I really only knew about the plasma tv's in 42\" 720p, so I had a lot of research to do to understand what to buy.After reading hundreds of reviews and going to several stores to comparison shop, I was basically down to three Samsung models. I was considering the LN-T4665F, LN-T4661F and the LNS4696. Going straight by the specs, the 4665 looked to be the best because of the 15000:1 dynamic contrast ratio. With this in mind, I was confused to see that BestBuy has the 4696 in their Magnolia section and not the 4665 - my only guess is that it is because the 4665 does not have a cableCard slot.After lots of playing I was more than happy with each of the TVs, and my choices were narrowed down by wanting more hdmi's right on the set, wanting the best possible contrast, and the glossy screen on the 4665. I have seen several complaints about the glossy screen, however this was a selling feature for me - for the same reason that I ordered a MacBook Pro with the glossy screen - I just think that it makes moves look better. I can deal with reflection during the day to get a picture that I am happier with when watching a movie at night.I must say that I am extremely impressed so far. I have not had a single image problem yet, and the setup was clearly the worst part of this tv. All-in-all, I am 100% satisfied with this purchase.So here's my brief summary of the high/low points:Pros: 1. (3) HDMI inputs 2. Excellent contrast - forget the numbers, as they are fiction - the blacks are black 3. Glossy screen - movies spectacular - Toy Story is mind-blowing! 4. Weight - This is one of the newer, lighter sets 5. Price - Not that this set was cheap, but I liked this over the Sony and would have spent another $1,000 to get a comparable Sony - and I hate the glass around the Sony'sCons: 1. No cableCard slot - really only matters if you want to mount it on the wallThat's how I see it. I give this TV my highest endorsement.", "Date": "April 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Here's why I bought this, here's why I'm even happier now.", "Author": "J. Hopkinson", "ReviewID": "R25SC3JN96OCHG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm the guy everyone in my family comes to for product advice, so hopefully my story will help people if they're on the fence. Most of the decision points are the same as other reviews, but here's how I came to my conclusion, and the unbelievable bonus that makes the purchase even better than I could have hoped.Do I pay extra for 1080p?  In the end I voted yes for this.  Why? Because at my core I'm a tech guy. I may cheap out when buying certain clothes or pack my own lunch, but when it comes to technology, I want to be ahead of the curve. I buy extra ram for my computer so it will take longer to become obsolete, and the same goes for getting the newer technology for my TV.LCD vs. Plasma:  I'm a huge sports guy so this one was tough for me. But in the end, I decided that the blurring on fast sports was probably imperceptible (I was right), I read some real stories about burn in, and I wanted the option to hook up my laptop if I wanted.Brand: Sony is too expensive, and I eliminated the lower models like Philips, LG, etc, and went between Samsung and Sanyo. For this, I looked at them side by side in the store, and the Samsungs were just brighter and crisper.4665 vs. 4661: Because I had been leaning somewhat toward a plasma, I went with the 4665 because it was brighter, more \"glass-like\" in appearance, and well, performed more like a plasma.  I live in a small NYC studio apartment with only 1 window. So while this sucks for natural light, it's a perfect scenario for this TV.  Glare is non-existent.40\" TV vs. 46\" TV:  I went back and forth on this, and to be honest, if Samsung had made a 42\" like every other brand, I would have probably settled on that. But the guy in the apartment before me had a 47\" Vizio in here. What was I supposed to do, go with 40\" after that?  So even though my last TV was a 30\" Toshiba tube HDTV, and the 46\" looks somewhat ginormous in my studio, I said what the hell and went with bigger is better. I think the quote that got me was, \"I've never met anyone that wished they had gotten a smaller TV, but I know several that regretted not going with a bigger model.\"Buy local or through Amazon: Well, we tried. My friend and I went to a local retailer here and said if he could come close to the Amazon price, factoring in shipping and tax, we would buy from him (both my buddy and I were buying TVs at the same time). They couldn't come close. Read on for the money factor...Bonus:  Here is the tip that you probably didn't know. So not only was the initial price ($2049) lower than the local retailer. And not only was shipping free. And not only was the tax free. And not only did I get multiple $25 gift cards because I used my Amazon credit card.But Amazon has a policy that you can call up unlimited times and get a price reduction if you see a lower price on the product.  So I bought my TV for $2049 on Nov 1.  A week or so later, it had dropped to $1999 and I called and they credited my account. I set a reminder in my work Outlook to check every day at lunch. It dropped again to $1949. Call. Refund. I definitely made sure to check on Black Friday. And Black Monday. And again. Call. Refund. And again.So in the end for me the price has dropped from $2049 to $1799, saving me $250 off my original price. Oh, and my friend's TV dropped $50, my HD DVD player dropped $10, and even my wall bracket dropped $20.But wait you say, I don't have time to sit on hold all that time. Well, you don't. If you go to Amazon's help page, there is a feature called \"Call me now.\"  You type in your phone number and literally 5 seconds later, your phone rings with a live person on the other end, and 2 minutes later you have your savings.  And no, I don't work for Amazon. Like I said, I'm the bargain guy, and I know every trick to get a good price. And if one end of the spectrum is creepy commissioned salespeople in Manhattan and the other is a flawless customer experience, it's a no brainer.All this would be irrelevant if the performance didn't live up to the hype.  Well, it does.  In a word, the TV is stunning. End of story.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Supposed to be excellent", "Author": "J. Heizman \"geek, educator, motorcycle enthus...", "ReviewID": "RRUY9WW545E45", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't normally write reviews without owning a product, however..  I have ordered (the 4661) based off the following:If you've never been to avsforum .com, it is a purely message board/forum style website where every manner of A/V is discussed.  There are entire forums dedicated to discussing the various technical aspects of LCDs to Plasmas to projectors.  Long story short, there is a month old, mile long thread that has nothing but glowing things to say about Samsung's LNTXX61 and LNTXX65/66 series of TVs -- how it's refreshing to have a TV that doesn't have clouding/banding issues.  AVSForum is pretty much the site for technophiles, and the positivity is consistent, so it's not just one or two jokers from Samsung trying to make their product look good.THAT is the reason I placed the order for this.  It has been a long time since a product line has received that much positive review on that site.Most have said the detail improvement by bumping up to the XX65/6 over the XX61 is subtle.  The 4661 has more of a matte finish around the edge whereas the XX65 has a shinier edge -- which most have said is not bothersome when watching a show (some were concerned at first because they could see themselves while watching TV but have said overall it doesn't bother them).DO NOT get wrapped up in the whole \"15000:1 versus 10000:1 contrast ratio\" marketing difference.  The differences are again much more subtle than manufacturers would have you believe.  There are whole articles about how anything over 500:1 in anything but a _completely dark_ room is not noticeable to the naked eye.Probably the main reason to perhaps go with the XX65 series is due to the apparently \"lacking\" speakers on the XX61 series.  If you do NOT plan to hook this TV to an external sound system, then it may be worth considering the XX65 for the improved built-in speakers.  The 65 has them on the sides, the XX61 has them underneath facing downwards and apparently the sound isn't ideal.  Although one might say for the 300 price difference between the two, buy the 61 series and apply that 300 towards a nice stereo receiver like a Yamaha.I hope this information is helpful, I will add once I receive one myself.  But if you're on the fence, rest assured you are buying the latest and greatest at a great price (come on..  <2500 for a 46\" LCD!  Just a year ago that was unheard of) and will NOT be disappointed.If you need more reassurance, head to AVSForum and read the forum on this TV, but let me save you the trouble, I've summarized everything of interest in the above and you'll find pages and pages of \"What a relief it is to have a TV that doesn't have the problems that plagued the last generation of LCD panels\".  The technology has definitely matured with this release.Take a look at Sony's V462500, which is a year old.  It was a great model from Sony, but at a year old it's still several hundred more than this set.  So the point I'm trying to make is you can feel good about this price.", "Date": "April 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great when working!", "Author": "M. Taffe", "ReviewID": "RG1IG5S1ZQZ69", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this set after much research 4 weeks ago after returning my 46\" Sharp due to serious and annoying banding issues.  When we finally got it and hooked it up it was amazing- great picture, color, contrast... everything!  I was in HD heaven until a week and a half later when it just stopped working.  It would only make a clicking sound when turned on but no picture or audio.  Never hearing about a problem of this type with these new sets, I called Samsung, who sent out a local \"factory authorized shop\" to repair it.  After a replaced main board and an hour of re-calibrating, the set looked absolutely horrible and the panel looked like it lost half of it's brighness.  After a second hour-long service the tech gave up saying that it was the best he could do but the picture is still nowhere near the quality of what it was before the service.  The screen is still extremely dim and the user adjustments do not make it any better.  Samsung says that the tech has to write the set off as irrepairable in order for them to do anything about it- talk about poor service!Even though I am sure this is just a fluke with my particular set- I am disappointed with the lack of service received from Samsung and the inability of some of the techs in their \"service network\" to repair their new LCD's.  Make sure you know who is certified to repair these things in your area before you buy one.  My assigned \"tech\" insisted that my dim, lifeless and washed out picture is normal and that I should just be happy with his work.  I'm not- and I'm sending it back!  Even with all the great reviews, Samsung has lost me as a customer.

It is 4.9 stars because there could be better gradients of color (but this is also dependent on the source) and I haven't been able to get bright solid yellows to be as bright on some plasma displays (which the CNET review aludes to) despite guided setup and tweeking using Smpte color bars.  And there's the whold LCD off axis viewing thing that washes out the blacks from an angle.  But the Cost-benefit ratio is perfect and the Picture in the $2-3K range is the best I've seen.Personally tested TVs:Philips 42PFL7432D 42\" 1080p LCDPanasonic TH-42PX75U 42\" 720p PlasmaSony Bravia KDL-40V2500 40\" 1080p LCDPanasonic TH-50PZ700U 50\" 1080p PlasmaSamsung plasma 42\" EDTVThis TV is far better than any of the other TVs I tested (slightly better than the 50\" plasma, see below).  The Black levels are comparable or better than the Panasonic plasmas, which was completely unexpected from an LCD.  Samsung's True black technology really shines.My Soap Box:3-10 years ago laptop screens had anti-glare.  Now they are all smooth, glaring screens because the color is that much better.  Why are we back tracking in TV technology by adding non-glare coating?  Do not listen to CNET when they applaud anti-glare technology.  The samsung has a glassy glaring screen that does not defract light.  Look at the science and you'll see that defracting light to get non-glare lowers the quality of the picture.  It's not just science, it's an obvious fault of anti-glare screens when you compare them side by side (or even one after another).  I have my TV in my basement where the lighting is customized and the TV looks incredible.Soap box #2:Why do people care about sound quality on a TV like this?  I've never once used the speakers on the TV.  Why have a TV like this and not use a comparable Home Theater system?  I got a TV where the speakers are hidden (since you can't find one without speakers very easily).  The speakers on the samsung are sleek and the silver fin-like sides that they are inset in are a beautiful design.  This TV has real aesthetic appeal.Final Remarks:LCD power comsumption and weight are both 60% less than plasma.  A 50\" Plasma burns at about 600 Watts and you have to also worry about burn in.  An LCD does not burn in (but can get dead pixels) and uses between 80-250 watts.  The result: You don't mind leaving the TV on if it's LCD.  The Samsung only falls behind plasma in off-axis viewing.  It has better white levels (because of inherent LCD technology), better energy usage (for the environmentally conscious consumer), and a few hundred dollars less.  I estimate that the 50\" Plasma puts out as much light to fill a room and captivate its audience as the 46\" samsung, which is why I compare the two sizes.

However,  Ive had my tv for a few weeks and have had several HDMI video dropouts and green flashes.  The video even dropped out once and didn't come back until I did a power cycle on the tv.  This is an HDMI handshaking issue which plagues the entire line of 2007 Samsung LCDs.  There are also people who are experiencing uneven back lighting on video sources through HDMI.  Which I've noticed, but can be adjusted to the point where its not bad.  These are HDMI 1.3 sets, but 1.3 is supposed to be backwards compatible.  So the reason for the drop outs is unknown.

THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.", "Author": "Shashank Tripathi", "ReviewID": "R369JXTYCTHXKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For me, buying an LCD is a simple contest: Sony, Panasonic, Samsung--with apologies to other manufacturers. Sony's Bravia series is very extensively advertised with bursts of colorful balls, which explains why they cost the extra nickel, because there truly isn't a huge deal of difference in the screen quality or anything else apart from the warm fuzzy glow you get from owning a Sony. Panasonic is better value for money, and has been high on my agenda thanks to my unhealthy belief in Japanese manufacturing.Until I came across this Samsung. The price point was fantastic (4665 is now nearly the same as 4661, if you must know) and the most aggressive of the three. Both the colors and blacks were rich in a head-to-head comparison, subtle nuances popping on this one. All these picture based paeans aside, there are three things that make the LNT4665F the market trailblazer in my mind:1. The screen on this baby is the *only* LCD screen I have seen so far that looks almost like regular TVs in its scene transition -- almost no flicker, almost no pixelation. It could perhaps be the 8ms response time.2. The sound is stunning, a bit like Bang & Olufsen's subtle bass and perfect clarity, although they're in a different price league. The secret is the \"SRS TruSurround XT\" sound from hidden side speakers plus \"premium audio sound\" of 2.2 channel dome speakers.3. And this for me tops it all--each channel can store a volume level of its own. Let's face it: we may dislike it, but in reality, different TV channels have different  audio tuning so as you navigate from channel to channel, you often find yourself upping and lowering the volume. Not with this thing. It'll remember your last setting for *each* channel!In other departments where it doesn't utterly trump the competition, it at least offers top of the line features, such as with the connectivity to digital devices. You get 3 HDMI ports and a full complement of inputs. And the handy HMDI-CEC feature lets you control all your CEC-enabled peripherals using just one remote.To cut to the chase, if you're reading this and Samsung is in your consideration set, let me make it simple for you -- it deserves to be the gold standard against which other contenders need to measure up.

My husband and I recently got married and he's been wanting a flat screen LCD the entire relationship. We agreed to wait until after the wedding and we bought our house, before jumping on the tv purchase. We wanted to do it smart and make a wise investment. Although no tv is flawless, this model comes darn near close.A note regarding what the previous review mentioned about the \"White Glove Service\".. it states it very clearly in the description of their service that \"delivery experts will place the carton in a room of your choice on the ground floor, unpack the product, and remove all packing materials from the residence. If you find signs of damage to your product, simply refuse delivery and you will receive a refund. Our white-glove delivery experts DO NOT perform installation services.\"We ordered our tv on a Friday night..and it was delivered the following Friday. And that was only b/c it wasn't processed until the Monday after we ordered it, since we ordered it afterhours on Friday. Anyhow, it arrived quicker than we could have imagined. And the delivery guy from Eagle was very sweet and called me when he was within an hour of delivery. It's a good thing he did too b/c Direct TV cable was on their way to install the HD dish and I didn't want the two bumping heads. The eagle guy lugged the tv inside the house for me and proceeded to remove it and set it up on the tv stand. We mainly inspected the screen/etc for signs of scratches or damages and made sure the remote was inside. It was a beautiful thing to look at, all glossy and black and a gleaming screen. And all this before it was even turned on.After Direct Tv set up the dish and got me running, I turned on the tv and watched in awe. We had scrolled to Discovery Channel HD. Holy cow. I mean I rememembered the feeling I had got when I saw the glossy vivid tv in the store but it was ten-fold when I got it into my living room..The most amazing black and vivid shades of color I have ever seen. It really doesnt compare to others I've seen. When we saw it on the wall at CC, there was no contest...my eye just kept being dragged back to it. Even though there was a huge 60\" tv nearby, my eye just wanted to focus on the Samsung 4665F. Now that the tv is mine, I get to enjoy the awesome picture anytime I want! We had a housewarming party and our guests were swarming around the tv..in total awe. Several ppl commented they had never seen a better picture. And the glossy screen is not really too much of a problem...my lamp is across the room and I just draw the curtains or blinds a tad and I don't have any reflection problems. And the glossy screen is what allows for such an amazing resolution and contrast. Those colors just jump off the screen!We watched Monsters Inc the first night we got it and it was heaven, pure heaven. It was like Sully was directly in front of us. Even the SD channels look unbelievable. With a bit of tinkering of the settings, you can get near-HD quality on everything you watch. Love love love love it!This has been by far the best investment that we have made. And we've had no issues whatsoever with lsoing the picture, banding, clouding, etc. MY hubby has played the playstation 2 and loved every moment of it. I think it's all in the HDMI cables that you have so make sure you invest in a good pair.Amazon beats the price of all those big-box stores and they have wonderful service.

Among my professional group, there can be no doubt the Sony XBR series sets the standard for LCD but the additional price - not insignificant - and the issue of \"clouding\" did not justify purchasing one after waiting for the XBR 3 to become available.  I haved owned many XBRs over the years, and have come to expect that if you can't afford a broadcast reference monitor (I can't), then XBR is next best (won't go into all the engineering reasons they differ from your normal set).I can't wait to see how the XBR-4 fares, which I'm sure was made to fix the notoriety of \"clouding\", but the price will take forever to drop to an affordable level.So, I've been following the Samsung LN-T4665 for months and reading the reviews.  I had a great experience once before with Amazon when it flawlessly delivered a defect-free Samsung 408 40 inch model.When Amazon dropped the price on this model ever so slightly after trending up for a week, I made the purchase and it was delivered today.

It is, in my case, but after dark, it's gorgeous, so the day time issue is one of placement and not worth nullifying my interest in a great set.  The other issue is one that has been mentioned.  When you up-size from a 40 inch 720 resolution model to full 1080, lower NTSC signal channels really look soft and unsharp.  This too will resolve when in 2009, all stations will be transmitting only in Hi-def.So, I'm still experiencing this set, but so far, hats-off to Amazon for keeping prices low and offering free shipping - and for selecting a shipping company that obviously cares about Amazon's satisfaction.

The rear input jacks are located at the same level as the lower mounting screw holes.  Virtually impossible to use a lower mounting bracket on this TV.

I am editing it now, as three years into owning this set it fell to the bad capacitor manufacturing flaw.  If this has happened to you please join the class action law suit at:[...]It is my advice that Samsung televisions be avoided at all costs.  It's not just that the devices are flawed, it's that Samsung refuses to stand behind their products.I will personally never buy Samsung again, and will advise my friends and family to do the same.---I purchased this set as an upgrade to last year's high-end Samsung LCD.  All I can say is, what a difference a year makes!  The picture quality of this set is outstanding.  Colors are rich and vibrant, blacks are deep and well... black.  When I had my previous LCD I would look at friend's plasma and DLP sets with envy because I had to admit, their picture looked at lot better.  LCD technology has certainly come a long way since.  The picture quality of the Samsung LN-T4665F matches that of even high-end plasmas.  If you don't trust my word, do yourself a favor and read the CNET review of this model.Some people complain about the glossy screen over plain matte as with most LCDs.  I personally prefer the gloss as it adds to the vibrance of the picture.  Also when it's off, the set does not just look like a big computer monitor.  Don't worry about glare unless you have a window or lamp directly facing the display.  I have a 10 by 6 foot oversized window 45 degrees from the set and glare is not a problem.There's a lot of talk about HDMI dropouts with this set, but in my case Amazon shipped a unit with the latest firmware and motherboard and I have not witnessed any problems in the week I've had the set.Anyone on the fence about ordering from Amazon should rest easy.  Their delivery is handled in most areas through a \"white glove\" service called Eagle.  There's also a liberal 30-day return policy.  You won't get that with most online retailers.  If you order this set remember to register online with Samsung right away any you will receive an additional three months on top to the standard one-year warranty.", "Date": "June 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great tv picture but defective tv & poor customer service", "Author": "B", "ReviewID": "R2F4IBEPI5MO2V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I researched TVs for months before finally settling on the Samsung LN-T4665.  The picture & sound is incredible.  It was my first HDTV & worth the wait/research.  I have some problems with a few non-HD stations coming in fuzzy but probably just the cable.  I need to do a little research & make sure I have the appropriate settings.  Now for the downside- Samsung's customer service...When I sat to watch the TV, I noticed it slanted to the side.  I immediately contacted Samsung.  The tech told me it may be defective but I'd need to try to tighten the screws on the bottom of the stand &, if that didn't work, they'd send someone out.  Given that the tv is 50lbs & fragile, I didn't want to attempt this on my own.  I had to wait over a week to have someone help me.  Tightening the screws didn't work, so I called Samsung.  I was THEN told that it sounded like the TV was damaged & that the repair would NOT be covered under the warranty.  I argued that it was DEFECTIVE & there was no apparent physical damage. Currently, I have to set up an appointment with a repair man.  If they then say it should be covered under warranty, I'll THEN have to set-up another appointment for Samsung to come fix it.I'm now wishing I would have gone with a Sony!!  I failed to mention that I was disconnected from Samsung on one day & rudely hung up on another.  I didn't spend that much money to go through this hassle or be treated like I bought something for $15 from Wal-Mart.

George", "ReviewID": "R2PODU0MRU5MB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before buying this TV, I took my time and researched it carefully. In fact, I strongly encourage anyone about to buy an HDTV to do the same. A really good starting point is: [...] as you will find thousands of posts about hundreds of different LCD, Plasma, and rear projection TVs. I was a complete newbie to this, but after reading the posts on that site for about a month, I knew that I was 90% likely to buy the Samsung LNT4665F.What held me back were some of the older reports about the device rebooting at random, and also the reports that the glare on this thing could be a nuisance. Well, I am happy to report that neither of these things have affect me (and I bought mine in mid-August, 2007). The reboot problems were apparently an affliction affecting the very earliest releases of this hardware. Sometime last year (2006) Samsung released a firmware update that fixed the problem on existing 4665s, as well as making sure this update was in all future shipping 4665s. I am very happy to report that it has worked like a charm with my run-of-the-mill Comcast basic subscription feed, with my Toshiba up-converting DVD player, and my AppleTV. (Actually, I ran into a problem with the audio not working when connecting the Samsung to the AppleTV. It turned out to be a coding fault on Apple's end. So, if you do hook up a brand new AppleTV to this TV, the very first thing you want to do is use AppleTV's menus to look for and apply an update immediately. After doing so, the AppleTV will reboot, and voila! audio is just great!}The glare problem--in my humble opinion--is nothing of the sort. It's almost as if this box were too perfect, so much so that hardware critics didn't have anything to criticize! Seriously, I have this set up in a basement that has several windows with the sun streaming in most of the day. I have not had a problem with the sunlight preventing me from seeing the TV or distracting me from viewing my shows, I really haven't. Nighttime viewing is just as wonderful.Lastly, in my own circumstance, I am not made of money, and therefore did not enter into this purchase lightly. I was really worried about getting a case of \"buyer's remorse\" immediately after turning the thing on. I didn't. In fact, I am patting myself on the back for finding a high quality piece of hardware for a very good price from an online distributor (Amazon) who has a good track record of returns. I am enjoying this TV every day. I am amazed at the outstanding quality of its HD output. I enjoy the \"oohs\" and \"wows\" I get when friends of mine see it in action for the first time.So, do your homework, ask people lots of questions, go see one in action if you can, and then just buy it.

I had also purchased a PS3 at the same time (July 5)... I purchased it two days before they dropped the price to $500.  A quick call to Amazon and they reimbursed me the $100 and gave me the free offer they were running at the time (Free Blu-Ray movie, PS3 remote and a rebate form for 5 more Blu-Ray Movies).- Shipping was great.  Eagle was very courteous.  They called me to arrange delivery approximately 7 days from the date of order.  They couldn't get the TV to me for a few days, and I obviously couldn't wait. They had no problem with letting me go to their location and picking it up. (DC area: Dulles pickup).- The TV is phenomenal.  No issues and all joy.  I have no clouding or dropout issues with the PS3.  I am not sure of the current firmware of the TV (July 5 purchase date), but the PS3 is constantly updated online.  The PS3 kicks out the best picture on the screen. I never see any pixilation or fading or any other jargon.  I've even sat close and hardly see pixels.- HD.  I used an antenna (Philips PHDTV3-Amazon) for awhile and it got about 5 HD channels and 5 SD locals. It worked pretty well.  I just got my HDDVR from Comcast and haven't had any problems as of yet.  I'm fairly certain it's actually a new box.  Their 1080i resolution is wonderful on this TV.- SD. I am quite impressed by the resolution of the standard channels.  They look great.- PS3. Blu-Ray and games (MotorStorm and Gran Turismo HD teaser) look awesome! Regular DVDs look great as well. The PS3 does an upconvert of regular DVDs to help fill out the pixels and does a great job of it.- HDMI.  Buy the $1 cables from Amazon (I paid $8 for two with shipping).  I must also give Circuit City their due.  My $1 cables got lost in the mail, so I bought a $100 cable from CC.  Once my replacement cables came (all 4 showed up on the same day), CC gladly refunded the Monster cable with no questions asked (just return them within 30 days).- Shiny Screen: No issues.  I have two huge windows in my living room.  I just close the blinds if the sun is coming directly in and it looks great.  Better than my 6-year old 32\" CRT JVC was with glare.- Bottom Line: I couldn't be happier with this selection (I did the same 3 month research pattern).

The Sony's are plagued with clouds to a point where it seems you have about a 1 out of 3 chances getting a Sony XBR with clouding according to AVS forums. Sharps are plagued with Banding and pillaring issues, there are very few on AVS forums that have a Sharp and don't have any type of banding or pillaring. So out of the top three I picked the Samsung due to only have very rare cases of clouding. The only downfall of Samsung right now is the HDMI issues which I will discuss below.Pros:1) Picture quality is out of this world with this set with HD content. You would swear you can touch the people when playing 1080P content. (I currently use a PS3 for BluRay content). My 4665 has a perfect screen with absolutely no banding, clouding, or pillars.2) Contrast Ratio: Darks are black not grey which you find with many sets. This not only affects black but the overall colors of this set. After seeing Planet Earth looks like on a 1080P via HD-DVD or BluRay on this set I can safely say that 1080P with the combination of this sets Picture Quality and Contrast ratio made me give a bit more respect to the 1080P \"hype\". When the content is there and encoded correctly 1080P is SIGNIFICANTLY better the 720P as long as you sit around 7 feet or closer to your TV.3) Inputs: Plenty of inputs make expansion a breeze.4) Atheistically pleasing. High gloss black on a 46 inch TV looks good on the eyes.Cons:1) There are still to this day (6/25/07) issues with Samsung and HDMI connections. I was lucky enough that Amazon got a fresh batch of these TV's with the 1008/1024 firmware which has virtually no issues with HDMI. I have only had one quick pink \"blink\" when my PS3 was doing a handshake with a BluRay disc that was starting up our of almost 50+ hours that I have used this T.V. for. Samsung Tier 2 support said they will have a firmware upgrade to fix this within 2 weeks.2) I have three large windows in my living room. The 65F has a glossy finish. I do have to close my blinds when I use the T.V. but it is no were near as bad as people make it out to be. But this is a trade off because this finish or \"grill\" is what gives you the extra contrast boost. If you have shades or blinds you should be fine. Otherwise if you don't you will be looking at your reflection.That is about it. This T.V. could be \"perfection\" which is SO hard to find in any T.V. out there but with a few small nuances that hold it from being the perfect 5 star. The HDMI issues are almost non-issue right now and will in the future completely disappear. The glossiness does not affect me because I have blinds but could be a problem for people with patio or huge bay windows with no blinds. Other then that, this T.V. has exceeded every single on of my expectations. Eagle delivery is fast, kind, and very friendly; but more important handle the T.V. like it was there own and it shows. The set arrived at my house and the box was in such good condition that it appeared it came right off the product line. They ship and move all TV's in a moving van, not a huge semi where everything gets slammed around.For all of you on AVS forums holding back because of HDMI issues, they are basically non-existent right now with this newer firmware. (1008/1024) (1 single blip of pink out of 50+ hours of viewing 720/1080P content)When the new firmware comes out to fix this small HDMI issue this T.V. will without a doubt be a perfect 5 star product.", "Date": "June 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great price, great set - zero major complaints!", "Author": "D.

I did a lot of research before making this purchase and spent a lot of time lurking on the AVS Forums, but before that, had no idea what black crush, mura, handshaking, clouding, stuck pixels, banding, etc. etc. were let alone how to identify them. Personally, i happen to think a lot of the folks over at AVS are perhaps too critical.My amateur eyes and I, however, are very satisfied with the set and recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, reasonably priced LCD (kudos to Amazon for once again offering great service at basement prices).PROS&CONS;Excellent picture and audio quality - rich, vibrant colors, good contrast and sharpness. I used a Sound & video disk callibration tool and the TV really seems to do a nice job with a little tweaking of the factory settings. Standard definition broadcasts, while they can't touch their HD brethren, are more than adequate for my purposes. We have a farily inexpensive Polk surround sound system set up, but the speakers on the TV sound pretty good by themselves!Stylish looks - the TV looks great in the living room and comes with a useful stand for those who arent interested in wall mounting.Intuitive onscreen menu and remote interface - Tweaking the factory picture settings is a must, and the TV makes it a pretty easy task to do so. i also bought a Logitech Harmony 880 universal remote and use that most of the time now (which I also recommend) but the included remote is solid. I did wish it had buttons to go directly to the source you want to use (HDMI1, HDMI2, etc.).The only thing I don't like about the set - and it has to do more with my setup than a flaw with the TV - is that there is a glare from the fish tank from our living room. LCDs are usually better than plasmas in the glare department but this one has a specific panel which gives the screen a pretty 'Pop' but also heightens reflections. It's only noticeable to me during dark scenes, but when I do notice it, sometimes I have trouble refocusing on the picture. Also, the set does seem to have some trouble with details in dark images (the black crush i referenced earlier).Over at the AVS Forums, there are a lot of complaints about HDMI handshaking problems where the screen will flicker or drop out every so often, but I haven't had any issues with that. I've connected a Time Warner HD-DVR box from SA and an Oppo upconverting DVD player (another recent Amazon purchase which Im satisfied with) using cheap HDMI cables (yes, also purchased from Amazon - no wonder they just reported a great quarter!). I do not however yet have a PS3 (its on the wish list!) which seems to be where most of the handshaking problems are coming from.Anyway, to wrap up, I'm very pleased with the purchase.

I couldn't be any more satified with my choice.  As for my experience with Amazon, I was a little concerned about buying a TV from a dot com Company.

Within a week of placing my order, I received a call from \"Eagle\" wanting to set up a time to deliver the TV.  Wow, that was fast!!

Eagle Logistics has been rated high in these reviews and that is what tipped the scale with me for the Amazon purchase.Here's what they say they will do with their \"White Glove Service\": Will deliver, set-up, ensure proper working order, and haul away the packing materials.This is my experience. My unit hit my city (according to Eagle tracking) seven days ago. I ended up calling Eagle five days later and they agreed to set up an appointment (would they have ever called me?). They gave me the classic 4 hour time frame, for which they were of course late. When the non-English speaking delivery person finally showed up (one person only) he did not have a dolly so he drug the carton down the street, onto the sidewalk, up to my front door. My wife showed him where she wanted it (while asking where his help was). He proceeded to drag this dirty box across my white carpet, not only transferring the street filth to the carpet, but snagging it with the bands that hold the carton together. My wife stopped him and said that it was not to be dragged and she wanted him to pick it up. He of course said it was too heavy. In efforts to pick it up he rammed the carton into the wall knocking off a considerable amount of plaster onto the floor! Why one person for such a huge and heavy delivery?Now with the carton in the middle of my living room (and the destruction left behind) the delivery person was ready to leave. My wife questioned that was he supposed to set it up and he again replied that it was too heavy, and besides he didn't have a knife to open the carton. To ensure that the TV was OK my 105 pound wife had to help the delivery guy lift the TV up and out. My wife again questioned that wasn't he going to set the TV up and check it out and he replied that he didn't do that.Now with the TV in position the delivery guy wanted my wife to sign off that the screen was clear, working, etc. She refused as there was not even power to it. He replied, \"just sign it\". She still refused. Now finally, he would not take the packing materials with him as required stating, \"you will probably need to return it, better keep them\".So this is the \"White Glove Service\"??

Its picture quality is one of the best with a 15000:1 \"Dynamic\" Contrast ratio. (Amazon and other sites rate it at 12000:1, but the actual Samsung website says 15000:1 .)  This means that you'll get very deep blacks that other TVs cannot produce as well. The resulting picture is clear, crisp, and simply stunning. The TV is also very bright for an LCD TV. I saw this in a showroom before I bought it and it was one of the brightest TVs on the floor along with the Sony XBR2's. The difference between the two of course is the price. The LNT4665F is about $500-$800 cheaper than the Sony. So why pay more for picture quality that you can get cheaper?The other thing you might find about this TV is that some consumers have had problems with the LNT4665F. The main issue is the signal-loss over the HDMI inputs. Essentailly, some users have experienced the TV going completely black after about 30-60min of operation. Turning it off and then on again fixes this problem, but the signal loss happens again about a hour later. I myself have experienced a similiar issue over the HDMI inputs, but it turned out to be a faulty Cable Box, and not the TV. (I replaced the Cable Box, and plugged into the HDMI and it works fine without any dropouts now.) However, I do believe that many people have had some problem with this TV, but I haven't experienced it myself. Like all things, I suppose there are a few lemons out there that come out of manufacturing. But thats why there are things such as warranties, and return policies for you to use should problems occur.Amazon's price for the TV was the lowest I found. Add the fact that I've always had good experiences with Amazon, and I was already decided on buying from them. They gave me free White-Glove delivery too. This is a service that they contract to a company called Eagle. Basically Amazon delivers the TV to Eagle's facilities. Then they call you to set-up a delivery appointment (Saturdays available in some areas!). When they come with the TV, they unbox it for you, and wait for you to test and examine the TV for any damage during shipping. If all is well you sign-off on it and your done.

It's touted 'Game Mode' seems to keep video refresh rates high without any sacrifice to video quality, but honestly they appear high enough without it.It's \"Just Scan\" aspect ratio settings are great for switching between multiple image formats on the same input, and ample HDMI inputs allow you to connect several HD devices without a receiver and even more via component and the optical audio in. The television automatically knows which inputs have cables plugged in and which do not, so you only have to cycle through the ones you use, and each can be assigned a generic label like 'PC', 'Cable STB', or 'DVD' so you don't have to memorize what is plugged in where.Delivery was fast, even through \"free super saver shipping\", less than 8 business days, and Eagle carried the TV into my living room, unpacked it, and had no problems letting me plug it in and test it before signing for delivery.If you're in the market for an HD TV, don't pass this one up!

Many mid-western and Pacific-coast customers are still stuck with older firmware that incorrectly blocks you from using HDMI from the cable box to the receiver, then HDMI from the receiver to the TV, and you will have to plug HDMI directly from the cable box to the TV.

I liked the shiny screens on the Samsungs because, just as in glossy photographs, the colors seem to \"pop\" more than on the lustery-finish screens.  The colors are amazingly vivid, with black blacks and white whites.  The skin tones look natural with no annoying color shift (as on our last TV).We have had our new TV for several weeks now, and we are thrilled.  The picture is beautiful.  I like the swiveling screen, a great feature to optimize the viewing angle from our kitchen or family room.

When opening the top of the box a few minutes later I noticed it had been dropped on the corner and  was cracked and delaminated over a 6\" area of the corner. It was so bad that if it was turned on it would have shorted out immediately. There is only a thin piece of styrofoam to protect each corner (how much could styrofoam cost?). I called the truck driver immediately on his cell phone (about 5 minutes after he drove off) and he wouldn't come back to pick it up (it wasn't unpackaged other than me opening the top flap). After reading the paper work it said the shipper would unpack and detrash (he didn't offer to do that).Moral of the Story: don't sign the shipping invoice until you and the delivery person open the box and look it over for damage. Even better would be to plug it in and verify it's not DOA (dead on arrival).Amazon said they would make good, although Santa is coming 2 weeks late this year.

The colors are bright and clear, dark levels show good definition, and the price was reasonable as compared with others of similar size and quality.  We ordered it sight-unseen based on reviews we'd seen elsewhere and familiarity with Samsung's other products.  This is used in a beach house in North Carolina's Outer Banks.  We have a LOT of ambient light, including two large windows across from the TV and a wall of windows perpendicular to it.  Even with all that extra light, it does a fabulous job.  Movies and regular tv programming look excellent.  Sound quality is also excellent.  We sometimes use the tv's speakers and sometimes our surround-sound speaker system.The frame around it is indeed very shiny.  If you have small children, it will show every fingerprint.  If it's an adult-only household, it will be fine.  A cleaning cloth comes in the package.  The screen itself is more reflective than most LCD's.  This is noticeable when it's not on (but not particularly bothersome), but when it is on, only very rarely do we see any reflection.Watching sports (baseball mostly) is excellent.  It has a fast response time so it's easy to see the ball in play.  There is no streaking or blurriness at all.Note that if you use it in HDMI mode, it will not receive the Closed Captions.  We have also noticed that sometimes the captions drop out of the programming when we switch channels.  I don't know why that should happen, but usually the captions are restored by pushing the caption button on the remote.Also note there is no on-off switch on the TV itself (at least we haven't found it yet!)  It's controlled by the remote only.  This makes the front very sleek, as there are no obvious buttons or connections of any sort.  The connections are made either on the side or on the back.  We have what's probably a typical set-up of cable-box, DVD player, and stereo receiver hooked up to it.We get a few off-air channels in high definition, and they look great.  Other than that we have cable service, and have not yet upgraded to HD.  We might save the money; pictures look excellent as is.Edited to add: we ordered this through Amazon which turned it over to Eagle shipping.  That worked fine:  they predicted delivery July 3 or July 5, and it came on the 3rd.  The truck driver was very helpful, carried it up one long flight of stairs to our living room, helped uncrate it and put it in place in the niche above our fireplace.  We were very pleased with Eagle's service.  Our TV was shipped from Reno to California to Norfolk, VA, and then trucked from Norfolk to the Outer Banks.  The driver was a sub-contractor for Eagle and some other firms.

May 30, 2007. (not available for download)Latest known mainboard firmware: 1009.Update: July 5, 2007The HDMI crisis is now \"officially\" over. If you are STILL having HDMI issues as described in this post, you MUST get in contact with Samsung , options, 4, 1, 1, and get a BOARD replacement for your set. For the most part, new LN-T TVs are shipping with 1008 mainboards or HIGHER, which should resolve the problem. If you are still having issues with 1008 boards, get it replaced (again). Apparently some boards can be finicky.More and more people are getting board replacements that are fixing the HDMI issue, so I feel it's fair to call the crisis over.Update: July 5, 2007I can report that I had my main-board replaced (1004 board, with 1024 firmware) with a 1005 board with 1022 firmware. I'm happy to report that for me, my HDMI issues are now gone after several weeks of use with zero flashes/drops etc.HOWEVER, it is still VERY possible to have a 1005 board with HDMI issues. The current official fix from Samsung is a 1008 board, with 1024-or-higher firmware. There ARE several people who claim to have issues with 1008/1024 combinations, but I firmly believe another replacement is therefore needed. I also firmly believe there are 1008/1024 problematic boards out there, and 1008/1024 working boards. So hang in there folks!(The bottom of this post explains the above numbers for the new people around these parts!)Update: June 23, 2007As fellow board member Sam Relishe has noticed, after a mainboard swap some of the settings might be wrong. I own an LN-T4661, and my replaced mainboard was set up for a LN-T4665. This meant the color palette was completely wrong (everything was red and orange and green), and I had a menu option to turn the blue light on and off (only the LN-T4x65 series has the blue light). The way to fix this is as follows:(Make sure to make a note of your picture calibration settings, as mine were reset after going into the service menu)With your TV off, press MUTE, 1, 8, 2, and then POWERThen, choose the OPTION BYTE.IMPORTANT: DO NOT MESS WITH ANY OTHER SETTINGS THAN THE ONES LISTED:Make sure the SCREEN SIZE is correct: Panel Option = 46AMW for LN-T4665 displays, and 46AM for LN-T4661 displays.Make sure that if you own an LN-T4x65 that your Lvds Tx Bit = 10bit.Make sure if you own an LN-T4x61 that your Lvds Tx Bit = 8bit.If you own an LN-T4x65, your should change your model so it says \"Tulip Side.\"If you own an LN-T4x61, you should change the model so it says \"Tulip.\"After changing these options, turn your TV off, and then on.Update: June 22, 2007One of our fellow AVS members, axmode, came across a way to check what firmware version you'll get, before you open the box! This might be a smart way to check before you buy the TV.To check what firmware version you haveThe 8th character in your S/N (pertinent to all 2007 LN-Txx6x models) is a letter P which stands for 2007. The 9th character which follows that letter P will be a number which denotes the months of assembly. For those of you who want to ensure having a 1024/1008 at the very least, that number should be a 6 at the very least (to be sure).Axmode verified this with his own S/Ns and the 4665 which went back was a P4 (1016/1004). The current 4061 is a P5 (1024/1008). This info may help those of you who are considering a purchase through a big box store, prior to opening up the sets.Thanks axmode!Update: June 21, 2007As of June Wednesday, June 20th, Tier 2 representatives at Samsung tech support have stated that the fix for ALL HDMI issues is a board replacement for those that do NOT have 1008 main boards with 1024 firmware. See the bottom of this post for instructions on how to check your version. Until we have confirmation from more people that this is the fix, this remains only SPECULATION on the part of the skeptical consumer. However, this is official and has been confirmed as the \"fix\" by several Tier 2 specialists.Update: June 18, 2007. Fellow forum member dkwong has compiled a spreadsheet so we can keep track of who has what TV, and what firmware information and issues they are having. Thanks dkwong!PLEASE send him any information you can so he can update his spreadsheet. You can view it here:Samsung SpreadsheetUpdate: June 15, 2007. 1028 is the latest firmware, with no confirmation of the HDMI issue being fixed.Update: June 1, 2007. How to use an XBOX 360 with the VGA cable, to resolve the \"Mode Not Supported\" message:1. Reset the resolution of the console to 640x480. To do this, start the console, hold both triggers, and then press and hold the Y button as the console starts.2. If this resolves the issue and you receive a picture on the display, you can continue to use the 640x480 resolution. Or you can try to use a higher resolution setting. If this does not resolve the issue, continue to the next step.3. Disconnect the VGA HD cable from the display, and then remove the console power cord from the power outlet.4. Wait five seconds.5. Reconnect the console power cord to the power outlet, and then turn on the console.6. Reconnect the VGA HD cable to the display. If this resolves the issue and you receive a picture on the display, you can continue to use the 640x480 resolution. Or you can try to use a higher resolution setting.1.) The entire 2007 Samsung 1080p LCD lineup is suffering from HDMI handshake issues. This is the LN-Txxxx line. This is not just video-game related, but reported units giving trouble include the Playstation 3, XBOX 360 Elite, HTPCs, and various STBs. Also reports from people with drops/flashes:\"Mac Mini (Intel); PowerMac G4 DP (with a Radeon 9xxx(?) video card); Denon 2910 - upscaling (1080i) DVD Playler (this a pure HDMI connection)\" - (courtesy of Ted Todorov)1.b.) These issues manifest themselves as dropouts (picture loss), momentary green or pink flashes etc. These may not happen for hours and hours, and then suddenly you can get hit with two or three flashes/dropouts in a short time. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the issue.2.) Several tech people from Tier 1 and Tier 2 support said that Samsung ARE aware of the issue and are working to fix it. There is currently NO fix available.3.) Design issues:There are numerous reports of what is known as \"clouding\" or \"mura.\" Nobody knows exactly what causes this, but it manifests itself as blotches of lighter areas on the screen or in the corners (corners are also known as \"flashlights\").There are several reports of people wiping the area with a cloth from the cloud to the edge of the screen to remove the issue, but I can't verify this. To do this, grab a dry cloth and wipe the cloud fairly gently. If it moves, keep moving it!Please refrain from asking questions about clouds, as this post should cover it. I personally understand the frustration of having had really bad clouds, but it bogs down the thread to discuss it ad nauseam. If you can't clear the clouds, and they actually bother you, exchange your set at your vendor. It is possible to get a completely cloud-free set, but don't drive yourself crazy. If you can't notice them during \"normal\" viewing, you've nothing to worry about!3.b.) Another issue affecting these sets is something known as \"pillaring.\" I personally haven't seen pillaring but it is visible as bands of light on the left and right of the screen. Apparently this can be fixed by properly calibrating your set: i.e. turning down brightness/contrast/backlight to NORMAL levels. If you have this problem, adjust your settings. If this doesn't fix it, return the set to your vendor. At this point, I believe it's simply calibration issues.4.) Some forum members are recommending HDMI port savers to take the strain off their TV's HDMI ports from the heavy cable connecting to your devices. Some have even said it fixed the handshaking issues they've been having but this is NOT proven as of yet (I can say they didn't help for me at all). You plug the port saver into your TV, and then your actual HDMI cable into it. I can speak only for myself when I say that port savers did NOT fix the handshaking issue.To check your firmware version, here are the instructions:1. Turn on your TV.2. Press the MENU button on your remote.3. Select SETUP, and then press ENTER.4. Select Function Help, and then press ENTER.5. Use the Up or Down arrow button on your remote to move down to Function Help to ON, and then press the ENTER button.6. With Function Help ON highlighted (don't actually push ENTER on it), press the INFO button on the remote. Your firmware revision will be listed as two lines of information. The TOP line is your software firmware. The BOTTOM line is the hardware revision number.So, I have 1024 firmware (software), and 1004 hardware (mainboard).If I haven't had any problems should I bother trying to get samsung to upgrade my board/firmware from 1008/1028 to 1009/1029?The only reason to change would be if the 1009/1029s had somehting the 08s were lacking. Ie when CNET tested the 61/65 both failed 2 of their 1080i tests and introduced anomalies with certain scenes of movies. Samsung contacted them after and said they had fixed this in a new firmware, they didnt specify which one but if that fix is in the 09/29 and not the 8/28 then thats a reason to switch.\"It also behaves exactly the same as the 65F in our resolution tests--failing to resolve every detail of a 1080i test pattern, for example, and failing both of the Geek Box 1080i deinterlacing tests (although it passed the video test when in \"16:9\" as opposed to \"Just Scan\" mode) from the HQV HD DVD and Blu-ray discs. We didn't see any evidence of those failures in Apes, but we did find a scene in Ghost Rider, where the grille of the RV at the end of Chapter 6 evinced some diagonal moir\u00e9 along its horizontal grille. We don't consider failure at deinterlacing a deal-breaker for HDTV picture quality, although if you have access to 1080p content, we recommend choosing it to avoid the chance of seeing these sorts of artifacts.For what it's worth, Samsung sent us a firmware update that worked with both sets to fix the deinterlacing of video-based, but not film-based, 1080i content and to show every line of a 1080-resolution test pattern. \"Samsung LN-T4665FThe good: Flat-panel LCD HDTV produces deep blacks with excellent shadow detail; accurate color after adjustment; clean image; solid off-angle viewing for an LCD; numerous picture controls; beautiful styling.The bad: Shiny screen collects excessive ambient light; edges slightly brighter than the middle in dark areas.The bottom line: Despite a shiny, reflective screen, the picture quality of the Samsung LN-T4665F exceeds that of any LCD we've tested so far.Editors' rating: 8.3 ExcellentThe image quality of the best flat-panel LCD HDTVs has improved with every generation, and Samsung's 2007 step-up model, the LN-T4665F, is irrefutable proof. To cut to the chase: in many ways it delivers the best picture we've seen yet from any LCD, and it compared well against the best plasmas on the market. Of course there's always some impurity in the ointment, and in this case it's the Samsung's shiny screen, which is the main reason why we didn't give the LN-T4665F our Editors' Choice award (update 06-19-07: We've also published a review of the LN-T4661F, which is very similar to this TV except that its screen is matte). But in the end we, too, liked shiny things, because the Samsung LN-T4665F outperformed other LCDs we've tested--including the latest models from Sony and Sharp--in a demanding, darkened home theater environment.DesignThe Samsung LN-T4665F is quite simply the shiniest TV we ever reviewed. The company's stylists went for pure, glossy black again this year, and for the first time the reflective gloss extends to the screen itself. The glossy frame is very attractive in its own right--we especially liked the rounded corners, smoothed-out planes, the subtly curved bottom edge, and the sleek, transparent speaker-sound deflectors that extend a quarter of an inch beyond the fuselage to either side. We also appreciated the trim swivel base, which allows the panel to be rotated about 20 degrees to either side.We don't appreciate the glossy screen, however. We assume the company chose a reflective screen coating, as opposed to the matte screens found on most LCDs, to attract attention in the store when the LN-T4665F is lined up next to the millions of other flat-panel sets. Unfortunately, the screen also attracts reflections from bright objects and lights in the room, which can detract from the picture.Including the stand, the LN-T4665F measures 43.6x12.8x30.2 inches. Without it, the panel measures 43.6x4.1x23.8 inches.Samsung's remote is almost the same as last year, and we generally found the slender wand easy to operate. Only the keys for volume, channel, and device control (the universal clicker can command four other pieces of gear) are illuminated, but that's better than most TV remotes, which skip backlighting altogether. All of the buttons are nicely separated and differentiated, with the exception of secondary controls clustered at the clicker's base, which kind of blend together. We'd like to see dedicated buttons for each input, but since the set automatically senses and skips inactive inputs, cycling between sources is less arduous than usual.FeaturesWith a native resolution of 1920x1080 pixels--popularly known as \"1080p\"--the Samsung LN-T4665F has enough pixels to resolve every detail of 1080i and 1080p HDTV sources, although it falls a bit short in real life (see Performance for more). All other sources, including 720p HDTV, DVD, computer and standard-def, are scaled to fit the pixels.The LN-T4665F is one of the first TVs with HDMI 1.3-compatible inputs, which have higher bandwidth than the older versions. In itself, that fact doesn't mean much, but the addition does enable the LN-T4665F to offer a menu selection labeled \"xvYCC,\" which refers to a wider color space that supposedly comes closer to human vision's capabilities than the current HDTV color space. Of course you'll need an HDMI 1.3-compatible source (the player and disc, for example), and as far as we know there isn't any xvYCC content available. In other words, we classify xvYCC and HDMI 1.3 inputs--at least as implemented on the LN-T4665F--as \"no big deal.\" The set's spec sheet also mentions 10-bit processing, but when we asked Samsung about it, they said that the panel itself doesn't deliver 10-bit color--just that the processing is capable of it. Extra bit depth can result in less false contouring, among other benefits, but like xvYCC color it requires a 10-bit source and display.As far as features that actually matter today, the LN-T4665F has an excellent selection of picture controls. It offers three picture modes that are each independent for each input, allowing you to customize each source with three different groups of picture settings. Only Movie mode allows full adjustment, however, so we recommend using it for the most demanding viewing conditions. In addition to the standard brightness and contrast sliders, there's a full-fledged backlight control, which is also independent per input.In addition to the five presets for color temperature, there's a full set of detailed color temperature controls. Labeled \"White Balance,\" they offer both gain and offset adjustments for red, green, and blue, allowing slightly more-advanced users to really zero in on the set's grayscale. The \"My Color\" control, on the other hand, doesn't seem to do much of anything, so we left it in the default positions. The selection of secondary picture controls includes items labeled Black Level, which affects shadow detail; Dynamic Contrast, which adjusts black level on the fly; Gamma, which affects the rate of progression from dark to light; and a selection for Color Gamut, which controls the range of colors the display can reproduce. See Performance for more details.We appreciated the solid range of aspect ratio controls, which include four choices for HD sources. Just Scan is the mode best suited for 1080i and 1080p sources, because it introduces no overscan and displays the image with no scaling. Standard-def sources allow four choices as well, including two zoom modes you can adjust vertically, to see subtitles or obscure tickers, for example. The set also includes a picture-in-picture feature to display two channels or sources at once.Like more and more 2007 HDTVs, the Samsung LN-T4665F offers three HDMI inputs as opposed to just two. Two are located on the back, while a third can be found in a recessed bay along the panel's left side. The Samsung's commendable connectivity continues with a pair of component-video inputs, an AV input with S-video, two RF inputs for cable and antenna, and a VGA-style RGB input for computers (maximum resolution 1920x1080). That recessed bay on the side offers an additional AV input with S-video, as well as a USB port that can interface with thumbdrives to display photos (JPEG only) and play music (MP3 only).PerformanceSimply put, in a darkened room the Samsung LN-T4665F is the best-performing LCD-based HDTV we've tested yet. We specify \"darkened\" because of its screen's reflective coating, which according to our nonscientific observation reflects even more light than that of a glass plasma screen. It's basically a dark mirror. If you're setting this TV up in a room where you can't totally control the light that hits the screen, we recommend looking for an LCD with a standard matte screen, or a plasma with proven glare-reducing properties, like Panasonic's TH-PX77U series. If ambient light isn't a concern, then the Samsung LN-T4665F offers picture quality that compares favorably with the best plasmas. Consequently, it's the first LCD TV we've reviewed to earn a performance score of \"8.\"We began our evaluation, as usual, by adjusting the Samsung's picture controls for optimum performance in our completely dark home theater. We really appreciated the set's excellent array of adjustments, including the fine-tuning for color temperature. We were able to improve the default Warm2 color temperature preset significantly (see the Geek Box below), although the final grayscale wasn't quite as accurate as we'd like to see. It varied a bit too widely in darker areas, although it was still much closer to the 6599K ideal than most LCDs we've tested. For our complete picture settings, which result in peak light output of about 40 footlamberts, check out our Tips & Tricks section.To get an idea of the Samsung's real-world performance, we watched Hulk on HD DVD played from the Toshiba HD-XA2 at 1080i resolution. By way of comparison, we lined the LN-T4665F up next to a trio of like-size flat-panels: the HP LC4776N 1080p LCD, the aforementioned Panasonic TH-50PX77U plasma, and our oft-cited reference display, the Pioneer PRO-FHD1 plasma.Let's get one thing out of the way now. The only flat-panel LCD sets we've seen that produce a deeper shade of black than the Samsung LN-T4665F are the Sharp LC-52D92U and LC-46D62U, which have other problems of their own. Hulk is a pretty dark film, especially in the beginning, and it served to illustrate the Samsung's black-level performance very well. During the scene when the green monster trashes the office, for example, the darkest shadows, the night sky above the building, and the black paint of the police car were all a bit darker than the other displays. Update 05-22-2007: We originally wrote that the Panasonic beat the Samsung by a hair in terms of procing the deepest black level, but actually the reverse is true. After rea-adjusting the two slightly, the Samsung produced a slightly deeper black level than the Panaosnic, although again the difference would be difficult to discern outside of a side-by-side comparison.Shadow detail is an area where LCD almost always takes a back seat to plasma, but the LN-T4665F held its own. We set the adjustable gamma control to -3, which preserved all of the detail in shadows and yet provided the shallowest, most realistic rise out of black, meaning that near-black details weren't overly bright. We saw evidence of this when looking closely at the shadowed shape of Hulk as he stands behind the tree outside Jennifer Connelly's cabin; we could barely make out the definition of his muscles in the light, whereas the HP didn't show the same detail and the Panasonic was a bit too bright, with a somewhat unrealistic rise out of black.Color accuracy on the Samsung was also commendable overall. When Connelly visits Nick Nolte in his shack, for example, the extreme close-ups of her face were rendered quite realistically, and we could see variations in skin coloration from her forehead down to her cheeks and chin. Looking at the Pioneer, our reference for color, revealed slightly less-saturated colors than on the Samsung, but the difference wasn't drastic. Primary colors and color decoding were also quite accurate on the LN-T4665F, and combined with the set's mostly solid grayscale performance they led to the best color we've seen on any flat-panel LCD.The Samsung also delivered an exceedingly clean image. The twilight sky above Nolte's shack provided a good example -- we saw far more moving motes of noise in those areas than we did on the Panasonic, for example, although the Pioneer was about equal. We complained of false contouring on some Samsung LCDs last year but the LN-T4665F was as good as any other display we've tested in producing smooth gradations between shadows and light.Screen uniformity was somewhat below that of the best LCDs we've tested, however. The most noticeable issue was the excessive brightness of the left and right sides of the screen compared to the middle, which was most visible in flat fields (45 IRE or lower) especially in the darkest fields. In program material--for example, the shots of Nolte in his shadowy shack--we noticed the edges of the display were a tiny bit brighter than the middle. There were other, irregular and much more subtle brightness variations in dimmer fields, but they weren't as noticeable, even in bright fields like the desert under the speeding helicopters. When seen from off-angle, the Samsung's screen maintained a relatively solid picture, not becoming discolored, and washing out significantly less than other LCDs we've tested. Of course, the darker parts of the Samsung's picture did wash out quite a bit more than those of the plasmas.Like any 1080p HDTV should, the Samsung handled 1080p sources, both at the standard 60 and the less-common 24 frames per second -- although like most sets it can't change its scan rate, so the benefits of using 1080p/24, if any, will be lost. We also checked the LN-T4665F's ability to resolve a 1080i test pattern from our Sencore VP403, and surprisingly it fell just short (most 1080p LCDs we've seen pass this test with aplomb), although it did resolve every line of the Sencore's 1080p pattern via HDMI. According to HQV on HD DVD and Blu-ray, the Samsung also failed to properly de-interlace 1080i content for display on its 1080p screen. (Update 06-04-2007: For those who want to assure proper de-interlacing of video-based, 1080i/30 material, we found that setting the aspect ratio to \"16:9\" as opposed to \"Just Scan\" will cause the Samsung to pass that test). How much do these failings with 1080i matter? Judging from the incredibly sharp image of Hulk, which appeared every bit as detailed as on the Pioneer (which passes all of these tests), not much. Of course, sticklers with access to 1080p content will want to use it with the LN-T4665F.(Update 6-20-07) Samsung has sent us a firmware update that worked with this set and the LN-T4661F to fix the deinterlacing of video-based, but not film-based, 1080i content and to show every line of a 1080-resolution test pattern. (This update is not reflected in our Geek Box results.) We originally reported here that the firmware update would be available as a download from Samsung's web site. Now we hear from the company that the update may instead only be available to owners who call the Service Center and ask to have it sent. We'll update this section again when we're told more. New TVs equipped with the updated firmware will arrive on store shelves, according to Samsung, by mid- to late July 2007.We also checked out the Samsung's ability to handle standard-def sources, and the results were mostly mediocre. The set was able to resolve every detail of the DVD format according to the color bars pattern from the HQV disc, but it had trouble smoothing out the jagged edges of rotating diagonal lines, and along the stripes of a waving American flag. The four noise reduction settings did a progressively better job of removing random motes of snowy noise from the disc's low-quality sunsets and shots of skies, but as usual there was a trade-off and details were softened somewhat as we increased NR. The Auto setting didn't really work well to automatically adjust the NR, especially in the \"motion-adaptive\" scenes with the roller-coaster, so we recommend choosing one of the manual modes when you'd like to fight the noise. The LN-T4665F did engage 2:3 pull-down quickly and accurately.We also checked out the Samsung's performance as a computer monitor, and like most 1080p flat-panel LCDs, it was very good. Using DisplayMate software via the VGA input--we didn't test compatibility with DVI/HDMI PC sources --the set resolved every line of vertical resolution and nearly every line of horizontal resolution with our video card set to 1920x1080 output. As a result, we detected a slight bit of softness in PC text at font sizes smaller than 10-point, but it certainly wasn't overt. The desktop filled the screen perfectly and overall we think most viewers will be happy with its capabilities as a big computer display.(Update 5-15-07): Reports about the LN-T4665F's issues with some HDMI devices, namely the Sony PlayStation 3, have surfaced recently, but we experienced no problems with our review sample. We connected a variety of devices to the set via HDMI, including the PS3 (we tried both Blu-ray movies and games), high-def disc players, a DirecTV HR20, a Gefen HDMI distribution amplifier and a Radiient HDMI switch, and didn't experience any issues. We also routed the PS3 and other sources through the amplifier and switcher, and connected those devices to all three of the LN-T4665F's HDMI ports, and in all cases our sample performed as expected.Geek boxTEST RESULT SCOREBefore color temp (20/80) 8401/7365 PoorAfter color temp 6379/6565 GoodBefore grayscale variation +/- 1186K PoorAfter grayscale variation +/- 134 AverageColor of red (x/y) 0.636/0.328 GoodColor of green 0.281/0.608 GoodColor of blue 0.148/0.061 GoodOverscan 0 % GoodBlack-level retention All patterns stable GoodDefeatable edge enhancement Y Good480i 2:3 pull-down, 24 fps Pass Good1080i video resolution Fail Poor1080i film resolution Fail PoorSamsung LCDs promise six-figure contrastIn addition to the Samsung LCDs detailed here, the company is introducing two more expensive series of LCDs in August 2007. The new sets incorporate step-up features designed to improve picture quality: 120Hz refresh rates and, in the most expensive series, LED backlights said to boost contrast ratios beyond anything seen before. We haven't reviewed any of the new models yet, but we can give you information on how their specs stack up. When we do get one of these televisions in for review, we'll update this information.Samsung LN-T71F seriesThe big step-up feature for this series is a 120Hz refresh rate, which is said to cut down on the motion blur sometimes seen by sharp-eyed viewers in fast-moving scenes. Again, we haven't tested this feature yet, and it's not exclusive to Samsung (Sony and Toshiba, among others, have 120Hz LCDs out this year), but it might be worth the extra cash over the step-down 65F and 61F series to some discerning viewers. Compared to the 65F series, the 71F series also boasts a higher contrast ratio, which might mean better black-level performance, but we doubt if the improvement is all that noticeable despite the very high 25,000:1 spec. Styling is also a bit different, too, incorporating chrome plating to accent the standard glossy black. Of course, these models include the same shiny screen we complained about in the LN-T4665F review, which Samsung calls \"Super clear panel.\"Models (estimated selling prices)* Samsung LN-T4071F (2 699)* Samsung LN-T4671F (3 399)* Samsung LN-T5271F (4 399)Step-up features (over the LN-T65F series)* 120Hz refresh rate* 25,000:1 contrast ratio* chrome platingSamsung LN-T81F seriesSamsung LN-T81F seriesSamsung LN-T81F series(Credit: Samsung)Samsung's highest-end LCD-based HDTVs for 2007, the LN-T81F series, includes the first widely distributed flat-panel LCDs that replace the traditional fluorescent backlight (the TV's light source) with LED technology. The benefits, according to Samsung, include more-accurate color and better black-level performance, to the extent that the company is claiming a 100,000:1 contrast ratio, the highest yet for a shipping flat-panel set. The TVs are said to achieve these deep black levels because the dark areas of the display can be turned off completely--traditional LCD backlights are always on, which causes \"black\" areas of the picture to brighten a bit as the light leaks through--with so-called local dimming technology. All this pretty-sounding technology costs a pretty penny compared to the 71F series (from $300 to $600 extra depending on screen size), but it has the potential to really improve picture quality. Needless to say, we're excited to review one of the 81F series and check out the claims for ourselves. Aside from the LED backlight, the LN-T81F series is pretty much identical to the 71F series in terms of specs and includes the same shiny screen.Models (estimated selling prices)* Samsung LN-T4081F (2 999)* Samsung LN-T4681F (3 999)* Samsung LN-T5281F (4 999)* Samsung LN-T5781F (6 999)Step-up features* LED backlight* local dimming* 100,000:1 contrast ratio", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great LCD!!!

Sharp", "ReviewID": "RRQ0F9ULOR2F7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd like to start my review by saying the glare issue attributed to these glossy screens has been blown way out of proportion.  Unless your a big time movie buff, you're not going to have any problems.  If you're that big of a movie buff, you're going to have control of your lighting anyway.  If I feel like having a movie night, I'll dim the lights a bit, but for everyday cable/gaming usage, I don't even bother.  I work for a cable installation company, so I'm in hundreds of homes a year, and I get to see just about every TV on the market.  I was looking for something that would fit the size of my living room, and my budget.  This narrowed it down to a 46\" model between three Samsungs, a Sony Bravia, and a Sharp Aquos.  Seeing these TV's in person on an individual basis is nice, but you don't really get to compare them, as they all provide great picture on a one on one basis.  Several trips to several different local stores gave me the opportunity to compare them all.  The local best buy actually had 2 of the Samsungs, the Sharp, and the Sony mounted along side each other, and was kind enough to allow me to reset all settings back to factory default for comparison purposes.  Out of the two Samsungs, the 665 and the 660, the 665 obviously had the better picture, and in those surroundings the glare was no issue (its no issue now that its in my home either).  The 4665F and the Sony made the Sharp look pretty bad.  While the Samsung and the Sony had about the same quality picture, the price I could get the Samsung for was a good $600 less, so with my budget in mind I chose the 4665F.  Had money been no question, I may have went with the Sony, due to the lower amount of service calls, but to be quite honest, I think the Samsung had a slight edge on the picture.  The only one that I couldn't compare side to side was the newer 120hz 46\" model.  I've seen them several times in use with Blu-Ray 1080p movies, and while the picture is amazingly clear, the 120hz seems more like a digital effect and almost has a fakeness to it.  The technology itself can be turned off within the TV settings, and seeing as how I thought I would not use it that often, again the $500 price bump was not worth it to me.  I am still blown away by the picture quality, its much better than I thought it would be when I brought it home.  The best thing I can suggest is go to a couple local stores and try to judge the TVs in person.  Between my professional experience, and those trips to the store over the past couple months led me to my decision.  Not much to gripe about, love the expansion capabilities with all the inputs, 3 HDMI ports was definately a plus.  I've seen other Samsung sets with remotes that allow you to switch between the different types of input strictly by the type of input you're looking for, instead of scanning through all of them.  This is probably the biggest downfall, considering I love using the included Samsung remote for most of my devices.  Another thing, I've had TV's that have collected dust in the past, but this TV seems to pull almost all the dust bunnies in the house.  I have to wipe it down with a cloth at least every couple days, otherwise it looks like a black car's fenders after driving in the snow on a salted road.  The screen isn't really a problem, it's the black piano like casing.  Overall though, not a big enough deal not to enjoy this TV, and it allows me to get into a habit of keeping the living room clean.I would definately recommend this TV to anyone, even those without a budget.

No kidding.", "Author": "Mark Nicholas", "ReviewID": "R47PFKHD5DN43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, let me start by saying that I'm giving this TV a 5-star review because I think it is the best TV for the money in the market today.  Hands down.  But you've read that in all of the other reviews.My addition: I think people should know that this TV is actually a bit ahead of the times.Standard Def. TV looks, as you might imagine, pretty crappy on this TV.  You see all poor quality artifacts everywhere.  But that's expected.  It's crappy 480i TV.  What you might not expect is that HD TV (I get mine from Comcast), even with HDMI cables etc., still sometimes falls apart!  It's not the TV causing this, I'm positive of that.  It's clearly the cable company compressing the HD signal to try and make it fit on their limited bandwidth.  I SWEAR I'm not a satellite company rep. or any crap like that.  I like cable.  I'm just saying, on a screen this size, you can clearly see the compression they use, particularly on fast moving objects.  (Ex: Bits of digital noise on the edge of fast moving hockey players and swooshing cars in action movies.)  It still looks GREAT compared to SD (particularly more slow-moving programs like cooking shows and CNN etc.), but it'll definitely make you mad that your HD channels aren't prestine once you own this television.  I promise.HD DVDs look better.  I have a 1080p Toshiba player connected via HDMI and things look really good.  But even this isn't totally perfect.  Dark scenes reveal the actual film grain (in the form of tiny black dots) on any movie shot on less than 70mm film.  You won't believe your eyes.  However, this is relatively minor stuff that you probably won't see on anything but the darkest scenes.Even Xbox 360 going at 1080p has its issue.  You'll see the 360 trying to redraw hard edges (particularly on very bright objects) as fast as it can, but it can't quite keep up at high speeds and there's slight flicker.  (I play mostly Halo 3, and on bright hard-edged maps, lots of flicker.  On softer edged ones, almost none at all.)Granted, these are nitpicks that aren't the TV's fault.  The TV is doing its job.  It's doing it SO well, that it can actually be tricky to watch anything less than 1080p!Fiddling with the color and turning down the backlight a little bit definitely helps with these issues.  They become less noticable.  The TV ships with \"Extended\" mode turned on, but I think any normal person would go blind watching this everyday.  I strongly recommend at least switching it to \"standard\", which really is as simple as pushing one button on the remote.And the MOST important thing I've learned: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THIS TV!  Right now our TV is about 5 feet from the couch, and honestly, I wish it was more like 10 or 12.  When I backup even just a couple of feet further, those digital noise issues on HD stations are much less irritating because your eyes don't find every last thing.Other things of note:- Though LCD has gotten a lot better over the past few years, the color of this TV is definitely not true when viewing from the sides the way Plasma is.  You'll definitely wanna sit within about 20 degrees of center for full accuracy.- While excellent for the size and price (certainly best-in-class), this TV still doesn't refresh fast enough to be perfect to the eyes.  Once in a great while, you'll catch it struggling.- Unless I'm a complete moron and I've missed something in my reading and button pushing, I don't believe this TV passes 5.1 audio out it's optical digital output.  Only stereo.  Not a huge issue, but if you were planning to pump several HDMI inputs to this TV, and then take the optical out to your surround tuner for all of those sources, I believe you'll need to rethink that plan.  If you've got the money, and HDMI capable tuner is the way to go for sure.Hope this lends something new to the massive archive of reviews.  But, now that you're prepared for the little surprises... go buy this incredible, near-futuristic TV and piss off all of your non-HD friends with the absolutely stunning picture and blindingly vibrant color.  (I've found that The Corpse Bride is a perfect show-off movie as it seems to ahve no film grain issues at all.)-m", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Eagle--Black Glove Treatment", "Author": "G.E.", "ReviewID": "R2GCGR2AGHNW2C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV is excactly as reviewed, very crisp and exceptional.My son ordered and received his SAMSUNG when I was visiting him in Phoenix.

Then the nightmare begins. In this May, the TV screen went black intermittently and there is only audio left most of the time -- apparent this is not an uncommon problem with this TV according some reports here. Then we have been dealing with the customer services since then and the TV is still NOT fixed as of now. It is in the warranty that they must fix the TV within 21 days. Otherwise you are entitled to a new TV. Well, it has been nearly 45 days and my family and I are still watching a black screen. The executive customer relations department still tell us that they will try to fix it.So if you do not want to spend nearly 2k to buy a TV that is bound to become \"refurbished\", then do NOT buy this TV. Or if you are expecting good customer services, then do not buy from Samsung. My wife essentially gave up calling them in the end and then I have to deal with the customer services.I bought this TV because I saw good reviews on this site and on others about this TV. Well, how wrong was I! Maybe most of the people who gave good reviews do not yet have the TV long enough... So give it a year or two and see what happens. And wait till you have to deal with their customer services. I hope you all will come back and re-rate this TV, just to be fair to future buyers.My review is based on my personal experience. I am a professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, and normally do not bother to complain about things like this. But this is by far the worst piece of electronics and the most terrible experience that I ever had in my life. So I think I have to do something about it.You are welcome to contact me for more information if that helps you to make your decision about buying this TV or not.----- Comments by July 21As mentioned in my previous review, I have been dealing with Samsung customer services and executive customer relations for the past month and half. Many promises for fixing the TV but no results at all. I here want to share my experience with future buyers.You know according to the warranty, Samsung has 21 business days to fix your TV. After that you are entitled to a new TV or money back. But the reality is, they will send someone to fix it and then close the ticket. So if the problem persists, they will reset the clock and have another four weeks to drag on. That is exactly happening to my TV. So you could end up with a bad TV for months without any remorse from Samsung.If you want to file your complaint to a higher authority, they will give an address which is essentially the same address of the customer service center (I did my research). Do you suppose such a letter will fall in the hands of someone who matters or cares?I did some research on the Internet these days about Samsung. Apparently the problems with my TV and my experience with Samsung customer service are not uncommon at all. Anyone can google \"samsung customer service\" to find out more.About other good reviews about this TV on this site, I would suggest the reader pay attention to if the reviewers have owned the TV long enough to find out the problems -- I was equally happy about the TV for the first few months. But TVs like this are not supposed to broke after a couple of years, nor would it take so long to get it fixed. My expertise is in electrical engineering. Unless there is some serious design or manufacturing flaws, such problems should not be so common.So be wise when you choose your next TV.---------- Comments on July 22.", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fair and Balanced", "Author": "Robert Domingo \"bobby d\"", "ReviewID": "R1FWBPT28RQIBS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Reading the discussion board, it occurred to me that a lot of people are skeptical about ordering such a big item from an online retailer.  So I thought I would start my review of the Samsung LNT 4665F from the ordering process to my actual experience with the product itself.  But let me assure you that the rating I'm giving is based solely on the product's merits and as opposed to some people's review, does reflect in anyway with how Amazon or Eagle handled their responsibilities respectively.So here it goes.I placed my order on December 16 and at that time Amazon claimed that it will be delivered by the 24th.  That was until I received the confirmation email informing me that the delivery date will after Christmas.Nice bait and switch I thought but no big deal on my part since I've been a loyal Amazon customer since 1998 and my experience has been very positive.  They did provide me with a \"waybill\" number in order for me to track the shipment but not Eagles website address. I did that on my own and it was quite painless.  The problem with small carriers is that they do not have the logistic capabilities of either FedEx or UPS in order for people like us to properly track packages.  The only information I got was that it shipped out from the Amazon facility in Irving, TX.  On Friday the 21st, according to Eagles website the package arrived at Chicago's O'Hare (I live in Des Moines, IA so it actually went pass my town 350 miles east.).  On the same day I received an email from Eagle asking me to contact them to arrange delivery.  I was able to speak to a very polite representative in Moline, IL who informed me that the trucks scheduled to make deliveries the following Monday has been loaded and because Monday is Christmas eve, they will not be loading trucks until the 26th which to me is understandable.  He then promised me that it will be delivered on the 27th between 9 and 11 A.M.  Perfect I thought since I don't have to go to work until 2 P.M. that day. At this point some of you might assume that there is a horror story looming in the horizon but lo and behold two very polite young men showed up at my door at 9:30 in the morning on that day and much to my surprise the box it came in was in perfect condition. No holes, tears, nor grime.  It was as if it came from a local retailer.  They unboxed the TV and placed it where I told them to.  They advised against turning it on immediately since it has been in an extremely cold environment and to wait at least an hour before doing so.  Needles to say my experience was quite positive.  I got the TV for $1549 plus a free Logitech Harmony 550 remote and the $100 NFLShop gift certificate.  It could have cost me $2120 with tax from Best Buy plus $106 for the same remote and I'd have to haul it myself.  Yay Amazon!!!And now for the TV itself. I would have to say that so far I believe all my research has paid off.  It's a very nice piece of equipment inside and out with a few quirks. I will not bore you with all the positive things that have been said. They're all true. Let's talk about the quirks or cons if you will.PIP - for me the whole idea of picture in picture is to be able to watch two TV stations at the same time (I know all you sports fans will agree). At least that's what my 36 inch Sony Wega does (which by the way I paid $2500 for in 1998.  How things have changed!) Samsung only works between components. So let's say your watching a DVD you can check out what's on TV and even then PIP will not show the HD channels. Bummer!But here's a tip.  Dig up your old VCR and hook it up. With its built tuner you'll be able to watch 2 channels.  It works for me.Remote Control - very low tech for such a high tech TV.  This one is very clunky and not well thought out.  You'd actually have to turn on the backlight and even then it only lights up the power and channel/volume keys.The numeric keys are on the top which makes it unergonomic. It cannot even program my 4 year old Sony DVD Player.  Universal my foot!SD sources - par for the course, non HD sources is below the quality of any decent CRT.Screen Uniformity - to the discerning eye you will notice unevenness during dark scenes.  The left and right edge of the screen is a tad brighter than the center.Picture Setting - with an infinitesimal setting permutations, the three pre sets is simply unintuitive. Gamma, White Balance, Offset, Gain?  To the average Joe the menu might as well be in Latin without making any difference.  I guess this is the case with all the other brands.  It's no wonder that people spend hundreds of dollars to have their sets professionally calibratedConnectivity - it's wonderful to have additional connectivity but on the left side of the screen?  90% of the world's population is right handed. They've gotten rid of the DVI port  but kept the RGB?  What gives?I'm sure some of you will disagree with my views but this is a personal opinion hence the 4 star instead of 5. That would leave no room for improvement which at this point there's a lot of edges that need to be smoothed out since the LCD TV technology is still a work in progress.  I don't think that there is an LCD TV out there that deserves a perfect score but Samsung is definitely among the very best. Considering the competitive pricing and high quality of their products, it's no surprise that they have the biggest share of LCD sales worlwide.All in all I'm very happy with this purchase and Amazon's unbeatable price.

Harmon \"Florida Maveric\"", "ReviewID": "R1M522G8VQNPTK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this set to replace a 42\" Panasonic plasma TV which during the daytime had a BIG problem with reflections from light coming into our family room from doors and windows.  So, I don't recommend you consider buying any plasma set if you have that situation.  Samsung claimed in their description of the 4665F that it incorporates new \"clear window\" technology to improve color performance, particularly the blacks.  I have to say I find the blacks adequate for my viewing tastes.  The 4665F has a shiny screen unlike other LCD sets but Samsung claims they have incorporated an anti-glare filter in the design that lets you view the TV under bright lighting conditions without anoying reflections .  I have to say that at least on our set, that is not the case.  Although not as bad as the plasma set, on bright sunny days which is frequent here in Florida, we get anoying reflections on the screen.  For that reason, if you plan to locate this TV in a bright room, I would recommend you consider purchasing another LCD model that has the flat screen surface.Overall, we are very pleased with the set and Amazon's price which included White Glove delivery, was about $600-$700 below the Big Box stores in our area.  Our delivered price was $1699 and subsequently Amazon dropped the price $100 and we had no problem receiving a credit for that amount, so for $1599 delivered, I think our purchase was an excellent buy.  The set was delivered on time and the White Glove folks stayed until the set was in its place and had a picture. The connections layout on the rear of the set are centrally located and well identified.The 4665F delivers a very good picture whether it is an over the air analog signal or true 1080i.  The suedo Surround Sound audio system gives you some of the effect of a home entertainment system, but if you want true surround, then connect it to a home theatre system.  It has a high gloss black trim around the screen and base that some folks might not like, but after living with it for a few weeks it is not a problem to me.  The set also has a nice feature whereby the screen swivels on its stand about 15 degrees to either side.  This provides easy access to input connections located hidden on the sides of the picture frame.  I've found that hooking up the output from my camcorder is a breeze and must say my videos look great.The set comes with a one year parts and labor warranty but if you register your TV with Samsung as I did shortly after getting it, Samsung adds on another 3 months of free warranty.  They don't offer any extended warranty, but you can buy one thru Amazon or any number of web sites.  The big question is whether these warranties are worth the price paid and how much service you will really get if you ever need it.You can quickly tell the Owners Manual was written overseas, but most of the explanations and artwork let you understand what you need to know.  The set also has an extensive menu of adjustments on your Remote Control that lets you cusomize about every thing on the set.  Compared to the Panasonic plasma set, this LCD set runs much cooler and we can tell a difference in the room temperature rise.Overall, I think the Samsung 4665F thru Amazon is an excellent buy and recommend to anyone in the market for a 46\" LCD to consider it.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great  LCD TV - Great Buying experience!

Of course, after only having plain cable, I just had to go out and upgrade to HD Cable.  What a difference and well worth it.I did have some issues where some stations would break up or not come in.  It turns out the cable connection was off of a splitter on a marginal line (quality-wise).  Once I disconnected the spliter (disabled another room) all came in great.  A stronger signal is required for digital/hd tv. Of course, none of this was the tvs problem.This is one rather large online purchase that I have no regrets about.  Amazon was Amazing.  The price dropped a total 4 times in a 30 day period after purchase and each time they credited my account.  What a great company.-----------original review starts here------------I researched HD TVs for a long time going between LCD and Plasma; 42\" vs 46\"; all brands, etc.  It wasn't long before I was able to narrow the selections down to only a handful of brands and models.  In my opinion, the Samsung LNT-4665F 1080P won hands down based on both expert and customer reviews; price; and past experience with Amazon.I've not been disappointed.  I purchased the set and received it 3 days ago.  Hopefully, I'm not speaking too soon as I've not had it long enough to see if any idiosyncrysies develop, but so far, it's performed to all my expectations. The picture is great and the glare I was worried about is minimal if not non-existent. I've even downloaded the latest software release from AVSFORUM and updated the TV to the lastest release.The delivery was \"white glove\".  They carried it to our upstairs bedroom, unpacked it and set it where I asked.  They powered it up and attempted to connect the cable and DVD.  I say attempted as they used the wrong connection port for the cable input but that's ok, they're delivery men, not audio visual experts.  A simple switch of the cables and all was working. They asked if I wanted to keep the box and packing materials or if I wanted them to take it away. They took it away. Both fellows were very polite and professional.Between the time I bought it and before delivery, I noticed that Amazon had reduced the price another $30.00.  I sent an email and they promptly credited my credit card account. So far, my shopping experience with Amazon after purchasing numerous items has been super.I would caution you though.  Don't start checking the price of this tv months after you've purchased it - you'll be disappointed as the prices are droppping rapidly.  My son purchased a Samsung 46\" model (720P) earlier this year for about $2200 and it's now down to $1400.00.

Pedrotti", "ReviewID": "ROFFTO46O8BD3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recieved my LNT4665 today, and my first impression is that it is an amazing piece of technology.  First off let me say that it seems I was a bit lucky.  My set exhibits none of the clouding or pillaring that some people have been stuck with.  I don't have an HDMI cable yet (the TV arrived much sooner than I was expecting, ordered monday night and recieved thursday morning of the same week) so I can't comment on any possible picture drop-outs yet.  The blacks are great and very uniform on all the backlight settings I have tried so far, and the extremely shiny screen seems to have no problem dealing with indirect light reflections in the day time.  The picture on my PS3 via component, and laptop via VGA is magnificent, though with a little ghosting as one might expect using analog connections.  Blu-ray is pretty much perfect on this set, and the Gran Tourismo Prologue demo looks astonishing.One little caveat is that it won't accept 720p resolution through VGA.  In fact the only 16:9 resolution it will take is 1080p, and my laptop can't output resolutions that high.  The next best option is 1280x1024, which is 5:4.  This strikes me as a pretty strange choice on Samsung's part.  After some tweaking I figured out that the only way to get both 16:9 and 4:3 content to display properly in this situation is to set the pixel aspect ratio (not the image aspect ratio) to 10:7, which you can do in VLC pretty easily but not in other player software that I know of.  This will directly counteract the stretching of the image to fit the display.  The other black mark is that SD content tends to look terrible, definitely sub-par compared to other LCDs.  If you can get a cable box or PC TV tuner card to upscale the video for you, you will probably get much better results than by plugging it straight into the set.Otherwise, this TV is excellent.  Unless you have windows behind your couch, I whole-heartedly recommend the 65, shiny screen and all.  As someone who owns a PSP and an iPod Touch, I can testify that shiny surfaces on LCD screens can do a lot to improve black levels.  Keep that in mind when choosing between this and the more diffuse 61, which I don't doubt is also an excellent TV.  And though its probably due in part to the fact that electronics stores need to learn to use better video sources on their demo units (not to mention lighting), I have honestly never seen a better picture outside of a movie theater.  And while I'm objectively aware that plasma screens can do a little better in terms of color reproduction, my impression is that this TV makes the gap pretty narrow.  I don't think you will be disappointed.Update: Got my HDMI cable, absolutely stunning results.  No problems with the signal, though occasionally I get static while my PS3 is changing resolutions.  It would be nice though if this TV would take the audio bitstream from the HDMI input and sent it to the SPDIF output, or maybe had some SPDIF inputs of its own.

I also noticed that my TV began to turn on really really slowly. I would hear a few clicking noises but see no picture for a good 20 seconds.I researched the problem online and found that many Samsung consumers with this TV had the same problem.The problem had to deal with the capacitors that the TV originally came with. They were not strong enough to begin with. I opened the tv up and found that a few of the capacitors had been dead (they were bursting out of their seems pretty much). With the help of the online sources, I bought 4 replacements at Radio Shack and began to replace the bad ones from the back of the TV.The TV is as good as new now and is still going strong.

Purchased 9/2007. Used only 6 months each year (we unplug TV when away) since we spend our summers elsewhere and travel a lot. Stopped working 9/2010.  Effectively lasted for only 18 months of use. I would expect a longer life from a $2400 TV.In 9/2010 our TV started having long delays turning on and, after a few weeks, it would not turn on at all, with the start switch clicking incessantly until I unplugged the TV.  Samsung is not accepting any responsibility since it is out of warranty. Internet search reveals that the problem is widespread and primarily due to deficient capacitors that Samsung installed in these TVs and is a problem for many (if not most) Samsung LCD TVs, with problems occuring after a year or two of use.  There are hundreds of postings regarding these problems for Samsung TVs (primarily those sold in 2007 and 2008) on various web sites. Assume that Samsung quietly fixed this problem on their newer LCD TVs, but who knows.  They are being silent on this issue.You will note that there are a huge number of favorable reviews by those who just bought this TV in 2007 and 2008.  I loved it too at that time. The picture was great.  You will also note that starting in early to mid 2009 the reviews are almost all negative as the TVs stopped working, mostly due to capacitor failures.  I am now part of that ever growing list of newly dissatisfied customers.There is a ton of advice on the internet for fixing Samsung LCD TVs with capacitor problems, including detailed YouTube videos. Based on these I removed the back of my TV (24 screws!) and the metal cage on the power module (or whatever it is called) to discover two failed capacitors (one bulging, the other bulging and leaking, presumably due to overheating).  I am planning to replace these and one more capacitor that is similar but has not failed yet.  Hope this works as it has for many others.As others have stated I will not buy another Samsung.  Have temporarily replaced the non-functioning Samsung with a new VISIO CRT TV (hopefully more reliable, but at least a lot cheaper).  Will use it to replace a 20+ year old workhorse CRT television in the bedroom if I can get the Samsung working again.

So, I submitted it directly through my bank account and Amazon didn't even attempt to process it and just canceled the order, dissapointing. That's when I busted out the AMEX, called them and authorized the amount(gotta love 24/7 c/s) and went ahead and ordered the 46\".That was all done on Tuesday 02/19. Last night around midnight, much to my suprise, I saw that Eagle USA([...] now) had picked up my shipment in DALLAS at the Amazon warehouse at 3:45pm on 2/21 but had a delivery date of 2/29. Confused I called them at 1.800.888.4949 at 4am and they answered! They said they had picked it up from the Amazon warehouse and it was now in the Eagle warehouse in Grapevine, 6 freaking miles from my house. The rep said they were open 24/7 and I could even pick it up, so off I went.The building had a big E-G-L blue sign on it, so was kinda hard to find. Went through security and to the docking bay, gave them my tracking # and ID and they went with a forklift and got my TV. He said it was brand new and they had JUST gotten the shipment in, package was in great condition with absolutely no blimeshes so I didn't even bother opening it. Strapped it in my truck and took it home. It was almost too heavy to carry in, akward box, but I got it.After unboxing it and examining its exterior for roughly 40 minutes I only found one blemish, probably during manufacturing but not caused by Amazon or EGL, a small scratch on the top of the bezel. Invisible if your not looking for it, but merit enough to mention. The screen was in prestine condition scratch wise, just a bit of dirt/smudge on the topright that easily wiped off.Upon turning it on I spent another 40 minutes searching for dead pixels, discoloration, clouding, or any signs of defect, none were found. I didn't have an antenna yet, getting one tonight, so didn't get to scan for signals so I can't say what that is like yet. Going through the initial setup was painful, the menus are so painfully slow it makes you not want to even calibrate the color/contrast/brightness/etc. Calibration is requied, especially in \"Game mode\" as it looks horrible until you adjust the settings.I haven't finished calibrating it yet, but so far I'm extremely impressed. The level of detail, with 1080p HDMI, over my 24\" Dell 2405fpw in Lost Odyssey is amazing(720p over component). In the beginning of the game lava pours down from the sky, with the Samsung I can see every single person on the battlefield running away from it, never even noticed them on the Dell. Playing COD4 on PS3 is just as rewarding, especially sitting only 6 feet back, it's like having my own theatre. Not even going to comment on the sound, if you got the money to spend on this tv you shouldn't be using it's built in speakers. I use Onkyo 5.1 system, sounds good enough for my room. In our living room we have a 720p HD70 Optoma projector that we sit about 12 feet back from, sitting back 6 feet from the Samsung is roughly equivalent for realestate size for the screens, and it is every bit as enthralling. A real cenematic experience, I am happy with my purchase and definately reccomend it.The entire purchase was a good experience, no delivery horror stories. But, I was definately weary and was glad I was able to pick up the TV myself, was a relief. If anyone in the DFW plans on purchasing this TV, good chances are you can pick it up yourself the very next day at the warehouse.

(Plus it's winter). My guess is that prices won't drop again for awhile - if they did, the big box stores would have to make good on their 60-90 day price protection on all the Christmas & Superbowl TV sales. Like many posters, I did a good deal of research and several trips to the stores before I decided on which TV to buy and where to buy it. I normally buy all my electronics from [...], but they have a no-return policy on big TV's, as do most of the electronics stores. Best Buy and Circuit City had decent prices but limited stock and always the 6% sales tax here in CT.  But at these stores, I could see all the sets lined up, and clearly Samsung had the best picture of any LCD set, in my opinion. The 4661 didn't have the advanced sound system and the 4671 was priced much higher and the only major difference was the 120Hz circuitry that reduces motion blur. The 4665 was a perfect compromise between features and price.I bought the Samsung LN-T4665 on Jan 29th from Amazon ($1670). Amazon has a very reasonable return policy and just about the best prices around with a very high consumer rating. I live in Connecticut and within two days the box was in Hartford but not scheduled until Feb 4th for delivery. I emailed Eagle and asked for a Feb 1st delivery so I could have it for the Superbowl. They said ok and they came around 4pm. The driver was polite, knowledgeable and very helpful and the box was completely free of bang marks and had never been opened. He carried it into the house, unboxed it and set it up to make sure it worked. I gave the driver $20. An all around great buying experience from Amazon & Eagle delivery.What can you say about this wonderful 46\" TV. Just the right size for my small room where I sit about 10 feet away. In a bigger room, I would opt for the 52\" LN-T5265 which can be had for around $2,000. The picture is absolutely perfect, the detail and color reproduction are stunning. No dead pixels, no scratches, no noises or cable hookup problems - it just may need a little tuning out of the box to reduce the saturation and contrast.I get my signal from Comcast cable and I drove over there and swapped my old box for an HD box for an extra $8 or $9.month. There is no reason to pay a Comcast service fee to have it plugged in, unless you are electronically challenged. I connected the HD box to the HDMI2 input on the TV with a cheap ($10) HDMI cable and it's just fine. Like someone said about digital, there's either a signal or there is not. One thing about a cheap HDMI cable, I accidently tugged it sideways and trashed one of the connectors. But at this price you can do that 5 times and still be ahead of buying a $50 Monster cable.I also connected a PS3 with a similar HDMI cable (to HDMI1) and I've had none of the earlier posted problems.  I think they were fixed with firmware upgrades. (I haven't tried Blu-Ray yet). If you get a chance to look at the box before you buy your TV, look at the 8th and 9th letters of the SN#. Mine was ..Q1.. meaning it was built in Jan '08 (1=Jan, Q=2008). If you buy one with P11 or P12 (late 2007), those may be old enough that they have not yet resolved all the problems described in these and AV forums. (I should point out that all my knowledge in this area is gleaned from these forums, so I may be blowing smoke out of my ars)Those buyers who have any complaints about the TV, usually say the PIP and remote control are lame. I would have to agree, but those are the only downsides so far. Any glare from the screen can be eliminated by pulling a shade or moving a lamp. It's really not a problem. I got the PIP working by putting a splitter in the cable before the HD box and running a cable to the TV. You can turn the PIP on with the remote and change channels, but anything else must be done from the menu, and really not worth the trouble (get a 2nd tv!). There is no \"swap\" function, just a split screen option. The remote is pretty awful and I was unable to program it to work the cable set top box. But the TV can be programmed to some extent to work off the Comcast remote (on/off, volume and mute). It's puzzling to me why Samsung would build this beatiful television and then put in a cheezy remote. I guess you can always buy a universal remoteThe sound is so good, that I just took my amp and speakers and put them away. But now I've hooked in a digital audio cable from the TV to the amplifier to try some side speaker surround sound.Comcast boasts that they have more HiDef than anyone else and that may be true, but only if you ante up for the premium packages. The Superbowl and golf from Pebble Beach have been the highlights so far. When you get right down to it, TV is still TV complete with the same idiotic reality shows and HiDef doesn't fix that.

I had difficulty deciding betweeen this model, the LNT4661, and the new 120Hz LNT4671F, but I am very pleased with my choice.  The LNT4671F was $500 more, and I felt the only advantage was brighter colors.  I don't see any pixel blurring with my LNT4665F, which the 120Hz feature of the LNT4671F is supposed to improve.  I actually had to turn down the brightness and contrast of my LNT4665F as it was more than I needed for our living room.Regarding LNT4665F vs the LNT4661, and after seeing them side-by-side at BestBuy, it was a no brainer for me.  One reason I chose the LNT4665F instead is because the LNT4661 is an older generation, and for only $70 more, I was able to get this next generation Samsung (basically meaning darker blacks and better contrast).  One concern I had with the LNT4665F before I purchased it was the glossy screen, whereas the LNT4661 has a matte finish.  Some reviewers claim the LNT4665F is too shiny, and maybe it is for a living room with a lot of light.  I would say my living room has average to slightly higher than average ambient light, as well as overhead canned lights, but the only time I notice the reflection is  when I am purposefully trying to notice the reflection on dark scenes.  If you have a lot of light and you want virtually zero reflection, go with the LNT4661.  However, if you want darker blacks and a crisper picture, go with the LNT4665F.  I also think the LNT4665F looks nicer when turned off because of its glossy screen and housing.The only downside of this TV, and it is a very small downside, is the speakers.  They are on the bottom side of TV, and with my tilting mount, they face my wall, causing the sound quality to be lower than it should.  However, I have a keen ear for sound quality and most may not be able to tell the difference -- my wife doesn't.

I looked at it side by side with similar models from all the big names and the 4665 stood up front with its rich blacks (I think that has something to do with the gloss finish) and bright colors as well as the sharp picture and decent stock speakers.

It's a great set, it truly is. I guess I can't add too much to what's already been said here but I would like to make a couple of points:1) This set truly can be problematic if you have it in a room with windows where you can't avoid the glare. My den has 2 French doors directly in front of the set and the reflections can be pretty bad during the daytime, but only in dark areas. Colorful or light areas aren't affected. I know the glossy covering helps with the contrast, but if I could change one thing, this would be it. I have a Maxent 26 inch LCD set in my back bedroom, and it doesn't have problems with reflections at all. I can't deduct any points off my rating for this as I had read that this was the case before I purchased it.2) I was concerned about watching the TV at off angles. My sofa and love seat are on the side walls, I don't have any seating directly in front of the set. This has not been a problem at all. The sets picture remains pretty consistent unless you get at an angle that's severe.Overall, I gave this set 5 stars because it has good contrast, beautiful color and it makes a stylish statement in my den. The sound is OK, but let's face it, if you're serious about home theater you're probably not going to be listening to the TV's speakers much. That being said, they still do a decent job. I guess it depends on what you compare them with, I know it's unfair for me to compare them to my surround speakers because the separation is so much better.I don't think anyone purchasing this set will have any complaints, as long as they realize beforehand that it reflects light.

I was under the impression that you could hookup cable TV, ps3, etc. via HDMI then pass a 5.1 audio signal through the optical output of the LCD to your receiver. I found out after talking to Samsung support that HDMI cables don't support 5.1 audio! Therefore, the ONLY way to get a 5.1 signal to you receiver is to connect the components directly to your receiver.Otherwise, this is a great LCD. BlueRay and PS3 games look fantastic! I watched football games on HD channels and don't experience ANY blurring (at least nothing I can see, and I've looked for it!). I don't notice any glare on the screen while watching it. The sound is clear and bright which is pretty good for stock speakers. It also offers a 5 band EQ.Ordering from Amazon was a great experience. The price was awesome, and I received the LCD 3 days later! Eagle service unpacked and tested it before taking the box with them.The price has dropped since I took delivery, and Amazon refunded the difference without any hassles!

But there are exceptions and along with other reviewers, I have to give major kudos to Eagle Freight!  Additionally - and as has also been reported here many times - the Samsung LNT-4665F arrived far in advance of its promised delivery date, leaving it uncrated and up on my TV stand by noon, August 9th, notwithstanding a scheduled arrival of 15 August! I would say it doesn't get any better than that . . .except it did!  When Albuquerque's Eagle Freight called to schedule delivery, they initially offered the standard 4-hour window.  However, I work very close to my residence and I countered by saying that if they'd give me even as little as a 15-minute call to my work number, I'd be at the house before the delivery truck arrived. They agreed (and actually gave me a half hour) and I kept my word, which allowed me to handle everything within the time frame of a lunch break . . . saving me a half-day's pay!  (Just try making a request like that to UPS or Fed Express!)  Finally . . . Eagle's delivery tech was truly exceptional!  Not only did he unbox everything and cart away the packaging, but helped (my deficient vision) check over the TV for damage (none).  Lastly, he hung around a bit and we discussed Samsung's merits and HDTV trends.  (He did mention that Eagle was delivering a lot of 4665F models lately.) So . . . just when you thought the world was going to hell in a hand basket, Fate smiles and you get a genuine attitude adjustment!  And what about the TV you ask?  Oh, it plays OK . . .  :)  . . .  .  Just kidding, honest.

The reflective face could be an issue with a great amount of daylight directly behind you, but that was solved that with room dimming shades, though at night it practically lights up the yard. The picture is flawless and the black is nearly as deep as when it's off. HDTV (air) is unbelievable although digital is excellent. Transitions, contrast, response time, color saturation, light levels and consumer adjustable preferences make this a joy to watch. The book is easly to understand and setup is simple. The quality of the sound is good for the built in speakers but the set deserves a theater system. I have compared it to every manufacturer (before and after),the SONY AQUOS being the closest rival which it still blows away...so much so that my wife even likes is over anything we looked at mostly because the size is not much over the screen and definitely slim.

A quick search on the internet revealed that Samsung used 3-5 10v capacitors for these LCD TVs when higher voltage capacitors were needed. A big percentage of Samsung LCD TVs out there have this issue because Samsung tried to cut corners with lower voltage capacitors (do a quick internet search and you'll see). Called Samsung to remedy the issue. Despite that fact that they know they screwed up, they still want me to cover the cost of repair - telling me that according to my TV's serial number, it's not in the batch that Samsung would cover. How much would the repair cost I ask?, they don't know but probably upwards of $150 to $200. I said no thanks. Went to RadioShack and got 3 30v capacitors for a grand total of $7 and changed them myself. Samsung needs to man-up on this issue or many of its current customers will not buy from them again.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung Bubble issue on my screen!", "Author": "Bruce C.

The purchase came after a couple of months of research.My review is a little peculiar because I don't do much with HD media.  I still have regular cable coming in to it because I haven't had the chance to upgrade yet.  I also still use a standard DVD player.  One High-Def thing I do use quite a bit, however, is a Home Theater PC. (...And a Wii, but the Wii only supports 480p and, even though the picture is nice, the graphics on the system aren't much to brag about)As a computer enthusiast, PC support was very important to me -- and this TV seems to have been built to meet my needs. It was a breeze to connect and configure.  In the back panel there is an HDMI slot with a separate RCA audio-in jack next to it -- clearly meant to support a DVI->HDMI cable and a 1/8\" mini plug -> RCA cable from a PC.  In addition to that, the TV menus feature a PC Mode which enhances the colors one would expect from a computer.  On top of that, my nVidia graphics card configuration utility allowed me to easily adjust my 1080p resolution to look perfect on the screen. Beautiful!Audio sounds great coming through the TV speakers, but I plan to hook up my Klipsch 5.1 pc speakers any day now.  Standard DVD's (which approximate to about a 720p resolution) look pretty good as well even though it's not really a close comparison to an actual HD format.  (I plan to upgrade the PC to a Blu-ray player when prices on internal drives drop a bit.)  I haven't done much gaming yet, but from the half-hour of FIFA World Cup '06 I tried it looked pretty good.  Any shortcoming in graphics would really be a problem with the PC's power and not the TV though. (I had an AMD 6000+ dual-core CPU, nVidia 8600 with 512mb of ram and 600Mhz clock, and 2GB of RAM -- decent, but not exactly a super computer for gaming at the time of this review)So why only 4 stars you may ask? Well little things mainly.  The standard definition cable looks kind of raunchy, but that's my fault for not upgrading to HD yet.  I do get 2 or 3 local stations in HD and they look pretty good.  Also, it's kind of annoying to bring up closed captioning.  Picture-in-picture is fairly limited.  The nail-in-the-coffin for my 4-star raiting is that you can only bring up cable in the PIP box, and you can't alternate sound source between main and small pictures (or at least I can't figure out a way around this).  So being able to bring up the PC in half the screen, while having the TV w/ sound on in the other half isn't possible in my current setup. (with a better cable box I could split the sound off and send it to the PC however)", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Thanks Amazon!", "Author": "B.

If you mount your television on the wall, the inputs/outputs on the rear of the television line up and are covered by the wall mount, especially if you want to use both HDMIs.  Poor design.

This TV was my choice from the 61, 65, 69, and 71 series. The 120Hz technology didn't impress me very much, and although 71 series do have noticeably better contrast and the \"chrome\" finish looks awesome, I couldn't justify the price difference between 65 series and 69, 71. As for comparison between 61 and 65, the \"looks\" was the major determining factor. The contrast on 61 is definitely worse, and we figured that glare is not going to be a problem for us.The reason I singled out Samsung early in my search was because a good implementation of a VGA input was very important for me. I view a lot of material from my laptop (which doesn't have DVI), and there are very few TVs that support 1080p @60hz over VGA. Samsungs LNT series do.Also, one thing I noticed after I got the TV is that 40\" will fit into a lot more furniture than the 46\" did. Not sure why Samsung chose not to make a 42\" version, because that would have been ideal for our room. 40\" seemed too small, and \"too small\" is definitely worse than \"too large\". :-) And we did find a very nice stand for our 4665 after all.The worst part about this TV is the remote. The range and the angle are very small. You do have to worry about pointing it at the right lower corner of the TV almost all the time. The remote is very Slooow, and the TV interface by itself isn't lightning fast either. The button mappings for my Philips DVD were completely off, and the \"play\" button wasn't mapped at all, only \"Pause\" and \"OK\". So I can still start a movie, but can't resume it when it's paused. I do like the layout of the remote and the back lighting, but overall verdict - piece of junk!!I did see some clouding on my unit, but at backlight level <7 it is almost unnoticeable. Doesn't bother me much, so I decided not to do anything about this.Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "BJ Ghassemieh", "ReviewID": "R1YNHN8L03965T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a few weeks worth of research and I feel that this is the best bang for the buck, and many others agree with me.Be wary of Amazon's shipping company \"EGL aka Eagle\" shipping.

So much for \"white glove\" service.....  Thank God the TV doesn't appear to be damaged by this carelessness.", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "46\" of High-Def Wide Screen Goodness", "Author": "Scott D", "ReviewID": "R263YKQW74JJ3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We finally splurged for a flat screen, coming from an aging 27\" standard analog TV.  We got this for a great (insane) price through one of Amazon's partners.  It was under $1500 and I've seen them even less than that recently.As for the reasons why we chose this TV, it was mainly due to the rave reviews this tv consistently gets. A lot of research went into finding a great TV and all those hours turned up this one over and over.  Furthermore, every time I've seen the Samsung's at the big box stores I've always liked them the best but always cringed at the pricing.Size-wise, we have a smallish room and we're probably around 9'-10' from the TV and 46\" is pretty perfect.Picture quality is gorgeous.  I'm really glad I didn't go with the newer projection-type displays as they don't even come close to color vividness, viewing angle or brightness/darknesses.  My friend has one and I always thought it was awesome.  After seeing his TV after having ours for a month, his now looks washed out to me.We are coming from a standard analog TV and I can say that this TV is just mesmerizing.  I don't watch a ton of TV but for a few days after we received it, I just sat there amazed at the beautiful picture watching anything.  Tuning to the HD channels and viewing the Discovery channel, Science Channel, etc is just amazing.  After watching this for a month, whenever I watch the old 27\" tv in the bedroom it looks unbelievably tiny.You may be arguing with yourself (or your wife) as to whether the costs are really justified.  Well, I was too...initially.  But like most other people, you probably watch a bit more TV than you think.  It's not only a source of Entertainment but a source of Education and News.  So after the day is spent and you don't have the energy to do something more creative, that hour or two a night and/or the movie experience on the weekend is very very greatly enhanced.  If you're into Sports, you really haven't watched Sports until you've seen it in HD on a big screen.  There's a surprising difference that really puts you into the game.I have to say too... that watching a movie on this for the first time was really amazing.  It was like being AT the movies.  The clarity and the image was amazing.  Add a surround sound system and you won't be going out to the movies for a long time.And, if you're into music at all, you will be enthralled watching your favorite artists perform in small settings on the MHD (Music High Definition) channel, if your cable provider offers it.  It's like attending concerts if you have surround sound.If you are considering one of these and you still have a large DVD collection and aren't ready to make a decision on HD format yet, don't fret... just get yourself a good upscaling DVD player to go with this that will run over HDMI.  We purchased an inexpensive \"Sony DVP-NS77H/B 1080p upscaling DVD Player with HDMI\".  This truly provides a new lease to your old DVD collection.  Standard DVD's are not a true 1080 source but with the upscaling DVD player (over HDMI cables) my god... it's got to be really darn close to what you'd get with an HD source.As for the TV ports, it has 3 HDMI ports which seem to be the future-proof ports to have.  The HDMI is a single cable that allows both high def audio & video to travel over one single wire.  A real boon since this cuts down on cable clutter.  TIP:  Buy your HDMI cables online through Amazon.  They're literally 20x cheaper at Amazon vs the big box stores.  I paid like $2.50 for an HDMI cable vs $50-$60 at the big box stores!  Buy 2-3 cables to have extras.  In addition to the HDMI ports, there are tons of other ports there.  Even a connector for hooking up a computer to your TV, in case you wanted to setup a media center PVR.What are the downsides?  The only thing I would say are the speakers on the TV.  They're not super, particularly when you compare them to a surround sound system.  But that's not a fair comparison either.  I have an older Yamaha 5.1 surround sound system and when I turn that on/off I am amazed at what a difference a great sound systems makes.  So, that's probably not a legit downside.  I have no problems with the glossy screen at all... in fact I don't notice it at all.  I used to notice glare all the time on the old 27\" analog set but this one has none.  I DO however notice glare on those shiny laptops screens that are similar and which I tend to dislike.  So that's a long winded way of saying:  NO DOWN-SIDES FOR ME.If you're on the fence I can guarantee that if you choose this model, you won't regret it.  It's gorgeous and you'll never look back.  It's a future proof, high def TV that will last for years and provide a lot of easy to enjoy entertainment.In the end this review was possibly more subjective than objective but a lot of what goes into buying a TV like this is emotional.", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a great price", "Author": "C.

I ordered it the evening of Black Friday 2007 and it was delivered the following Tuesday morning before I left for work! My son bought this set in August and recommended it. It is a bit better than the Sony 46\" Bravia we purchased in January 2007. I have it in a dark room, versus the Sony flat finish screen, so the Samsung shiny screen does not reflect anything there.It was fairly easy to set up, but the instructions from the TV manufacturer and cable company are overly complicated and some folks might need help. My set up just uses an HDMI cable to the cable box and video cables to the DVD. I needed set up help from my son only to find the HDMI source button - second from left at the top of the set.Versus the Sony, the blacks on this set appear a bit darker and the detail is a bit sharper, but both are excellent sets.

I do have a Wii and an original X-box that I hooked up via component cables.  They both look wonderful.  I hope to update my satellite service to High Def within the next few weeks.  Then I get to see even more of what this TV is capable of.I almost bought the model that the LNT4665F replaced but I'm glad I waited.

TV arrived in Atlanta two days later.  However, 7 days later when we had not been contacted for delivery I had to e-mail Amazon who provided a local number which I called and got a lame excuse from the shippers, but finally got delivery scheduled 2 days later.  However, they delivered and started to leave.  I had to reminded them it was white glove service which they said wasn't shown on the shipping orders, so they opened the box and checked for damage and left. So, beware, just because it has arrived quickly, doesn't mean it will be delivered quickly and you may need to take action yourself.We have always had plain tv cable service and needed to upgrade to digital and a DVR box with Comcast to get the HD service.  Be aware that there are only a few channels broadcast in HD and you don't get them on Comcast cable unless you have the DVR box, and that every program on those channels may not be HD.  Also the large screen will make pictures not in HD less sharp than your analog tv and sometimes does not fill the screen fully.  Then you must use the picture button to stretch the picture which gives the picture a slightly squat look.  The zoom button will take the squat look out, but then the top and bottom of the screen is cut off a bit.  Comcast has a warning on it's web site that using the tv's for more than 2 hours with the small picture could cause burn-in on the sides resulting in permanent damage.The Samsung remote is easy to use, but is superceded by the DVR Comcast remote.All in all, we have had no problems with the TV, just need to adjust to the new technology of HD.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Value for Money", "Author": "Gagan Kumar", "ReviewID": "R60HT5VKB8VUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent several months researching Plasma and LCD TV's.

Let me tell you this tv is all I was looking for, I should've bought it 3 months ago instead of buying and returning several Sharp 60U series. I guess I was suckered in by their marketing BS of 4ms responce time vs 8ms responce time on Samsung. Don't buy their marketing BS its beyond human eye to see the difference. First of all colors and blacks on this tv are unbelieveble, I can not stop watching this tv even when my 2 year old is watching his cartoons. Let me refrase that, especially when my 2 year old is watching his cartoons. You can fine tune each component the way you like it not the manufacturer, sound is good (above average), rotating stand is a big plus especially for me (big living room)I can watch it comfortably no matter where I sit.  Piano black finish is good but I wish they would add some silver accents to it to blend in with my stand and other equipment. Many of you are probably wondering how does this tv compares to Sharp Aquos 60U or 90U series. Well let me tell you first hand, I owned two Sharps one Costco's (ugly) model and the other CompUsa model, both of them had unbearable banding issues, once your eye catches it your tv watching experience becomes an evaluation process every time you turn in on, but that is not it, colors on Sharp are nowhere near the colors on Samsung, you don't even need to compare them side by side it's that obvious. HD broadcast blows Sharp away, SD broadcast (which is most of my channels) is as good as Sharp, the only thing that sets them apart is that you can do more tweekng on Samsung to get a better picture. The only category where Sharp wins (in my book) is the looks, it looks sexier and not as bulky. As far as glossy screen, the guys at c**t need to lay their crack pipe down and test it again. I have a huge window 3 feet away at 90 degrees from my Sammy and do not experience any more problems then I did with Sharp, which was not a big deal, unless you have a window directly in front of your tv, in that case you'll have a horrible experience watching any tv. So don't let them scare you and don't settle for the last years model. If you're on the market for one don't even look at anything else, use my and many others experience of researching, comparing, buying and returning.

I recommend anyone having problems similar to what I had, to call 1800-Samsung to see if their TV is under the warranty.**In addition, the tech that came out mentioned he could only replace the capacitors with similar capacitors (2200\u00b5F 10V) and the problem may occur again in a few years...

My experience with Amazon has never been anything short of fantastic, and this TV would not have been in my budget if I would have had to pay sticker price at Best Buy or somewhere similar. I was in a unique situation with the shipping company, because I couldn't get away from work and had to pick up the TV myself. The box had a puncture in it when I received it, but the TV is packaged well and was in mint condition. Setup was easy and I hooked it up to my HDTV/DVR unit with an HDMI cable and was instantly amazed by the picture. I will agree with previous reviewers in that the picture can definitely be fine-tuned and it is never a bad thing to customize the visual settings to how you want them to be. Along with my HDTV/DVR unit, I also have a Nintendo Wii and Xbox 360 Elite with the HD-DVD attachment hooked up to the TV via AVI and an HDMI cable, respectively. While the Wii, of course, is not outputting high quality video, it's still great on this TV and has been the life of many parties. Games on the Xbox 360 Elite look fantastic, Gears of War is incredible. All of the HD-DVD movies I have watched looked great, including: 300, Troy, Blood Diamond, King Kong, and Casino. I am probably going to be adding a PS3 to my arsenal within the next few months, which should only make my experience better.I would wholeheartedly recommend this TV for anyone who is interested. The value you get is probably unsurpassed as far as HDTVs go. You can get the same level of quality from other TVs, but be prepared to pay significantly more.

In my case, I'm connecting to my MacBook Pro via a DVI-HDMI cable, with plans to transition to a Mac Mini... if only there was a resolution to this issue. I'm getting random loss of sync as evidenced by green lines (horizontal) and green sparkle noise, as well as a little pink sparkle noise. The issue can occur randomly when using the computer as the video source, though it seems especially prone to happen with MTV style video (fast editing, with grainy effects). This is totally annoying and probably going to cause me to return the unit, because the various reviews on the net seem to point to this issue as being not yet resolved. I have the 1009/1029 setup if you are a reader who is also tracking the firmware/hardware versions associated with this problem. Also, I can't sync over HDMI at 480i, though I'm catching hints that there's some debate as to whether 480i is legit over HDMI at all... Anyway, the 480i issue is easy enough to work around. However, the green noise and sparkle totally ruins my experience for now. If no clear resolution, I'm hauling this sucker back to Fry's. I'm not the kind of consumer who can stand to let my retail return privilege expire while Samsung might perhaps fix the issue if they feel like it... especially when the apparent fix is to get a board replaced... so much easier to just return the thing. Summary: Great product, ruined by REALLY STUPID hardware bug. ARGGUPDATE:When I called Samsung support, they immediately volunteered to replace my board in-home, despite me having post-fix versions. That gave me a little concern, so I took my DVI-HDMI cable back to a retail store, and tested it with two other Samsungs. In my case, it turned out to be the cable, which was a non-descript $20 job (probably the stuff you'd get for $5 online). So before I left the store, I tested another brand of cable, this time at $35 number, and it worked great (all testing done with a MacBook Pro with the X1600 Radeon). I took this cable home, and I have not seen a single green flicker in about 2 hours of testing (prior, it was occurring almost on command by playing certain movie trailers). Moral of the story: Newcomers to this field must not get caught up in all the hype about \"cable quality doesn't matter due to HDMI being digital.\" Obviously the physical transmission is ALWAYS analog by definition, so at some threshold the cable quality must matter, and I hit that threshold with a cable bought from a Fry's retail store.  So if you have a post-fix TV that should work, try simply replacing the cable first, before banging your head against the wall all day!

Ordered placed on a Thursday, had the TV in my home the following Monday evening. Free shipping...Prior to purchase I reviewed the forum posintgs for the 4665 model on avsforums, where a user recommended set of calibration settings is offered. I've used these exclusively.Amazon dropped the price of the TV a week after I purchased, and by simply contacting their customer support via email Amazon quickly, and without hassle, credited my CC for the difference.I received a brand new model with the latest firmware (as of Sept. 2007). The avsforums tell you how to determine a unit's assembly date btw. Mine was a P9 (8th and 9th digit of serial number) so the firmware shipped on my model was up to date and contained fixes for the HDMI dropout issues that affected pre-P6 models. I use all three HDMI inputs (cable, upscale DVD player and xbox360 Elite) and have never experienced a dropout or flash.Watching HD channels (using the avs recommended calibration settings) is spectacular. I also have a xbox360 elite (HDMI) and the picture is incredible. Great brightness and color, good black levels.Guests who visit (some of whom own HD TVs of their own) unanimously remark on the TV's breathtaking clarity; especially during football games.The TV sits on a backwards tilt/angle of about 5 degrees, so factor this into your placement decision if you intend on placing it upon a table/stand.I have a large window in the TV viewing room with vertical blinds, and have no trouble with glare. Nor do I have any issues with the horizontal viewing angle. TV remote is stylish as well as functional. Key remote buttons such as picture size and TV mode (standard, dynamic and movie) are color coded for quick recognition.I thought a 40\" would suffice, \"save myself some money by conceding to the smaller model, right?\"  Then prior to purchase I read reviews from readers who recently purchased flat panel TVs. The #1 complaint was, \"We wished we got a bigger model.\"Embracing that advice, I opted to go for the 46\" 4665 model.And now, every time I sit down on the sofa, beverage of choice in hand, TV remote in the other, I mentally pat myself on the back for the best electronic investment I've ever made.", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "exceptional purchase", "Author": "V.

After comparing this TV to other TV's including other Samsung models the best way that I can describe the viewing screen is as if someone that has contacts/glasses takes them off (other models) then puts the glasses/contacts back on and can see crystal clear again (this model).I chose the 46 inch model instead of the 4065 (40 inch) since I reasoned that the actual viewing image on the screen would be larger when taking into account the black banding that at times takes away from the actual viewing screen experience.  The black bands that are there more times than not I notice are there due to the broadcast signal a program is broadcast on.  They are also on several high definition channels that I believe are dependant on the type of cameras that were used during production of a particular segment and not at a full 1080p.  This TV allows one to expand the viewable images on the screen but can loose some clarity or parts (sides/top) of the actual production as was originally recorded.  The actual LCD screen on this model is 40 \u00bc inches wide by 22 \u00bd inches high with a few inches per side for the black bezel.  This TV is ahead of it's time.  It truly shines when viewing broadcast high def productions.  I have recently had Verizon FIOS installed and have to say that the high def channel broadcasts are so life like and captivating when the production is made with high quality high def cameras/equipment (entire viewable screen is used)at 1080p.  Going back to watching regular non high def broadcast programming on non high def channels is like...(see glass/contact comparison above).Watching movies on DVD is truly another experience!  I received the Oppo DV-981HD, 1080p Up-Converting model (from Amazon.com) as a gift and have to say WOW.  This TV and the Oppo DVD player make watching movies an amazing experience.  Full screen viewing with images so crisp and clear!  The Oppo unit comes with an HDMI cable so that is a bonus.  On cables... buy a cheap HDMI cable if you need more HDMI cables (many available at Amazon.com).  I also purchased a cheap $4.00 HDMI cable and an expensive $60.00.  There is no difference.

In the summer of 2008 the set would turn on with sound but no picture. Though covered under warranty it took Samsung and it authorized repair provider nearly three weeks to replace the main and IP boards (had to be ordered). It worked swimmingly until late summer 2010 - yes, 1 month after the extended warranty was up. Then we turned it on one evening and had purple/pink dead pixels. Turn off and on and they went away. Then the fun began. We started to notice when the set was turned on, it would cycle on and off, a few times, then a few more times. We are now up to 10 minutes/ 15 cycles for the set to come on, then we deal with the dead pixels so you have to shut it off and then back on. Currently we have to do this 3 times to get all the pixels back. I am not looking for a TV I have to coddle to watch. Samsung has offered us a 1x courtesy repair, apparently the on/off pixel thing is a known problem from them using underpowered capacitors on the power supply board. After doing some research online, it appears that Samsung is now stepping up to take care of the issue, but initially did not. I will see how this repair goes, but am unlikely to buy another Samsung TV of any kind.

I did a lot of research on HDTVs at the time, and was looking for a one of the best, and I stumbled upon the LNT4665F - it was one of the best Samsung HDTV you could buy back in the day, but since the the TV market is so competitive, HDTVs soon become discontinued.I first bought this TV back in March 2008 - within 3 months, the TV started showing some problems. A gray line right across the screen appeared (dead pixels). Samsung support was great, they sent a third party repair company to fix it within a week. After all that, a year went by my tv started having problems turning on - it would constantly turn on/off for hours, and never turn on. My one year manufacture warranty was up, but I was smart and purchased an extended warranty from FRY's Electronics; they replaced my tv with a newer/later model instead of repairing the 65F.The LNT4665F had great picture quality - the sound quality was decent, you can set it up to have surround sound; the color set up was easy to set up as well. You can adjust the back light LED so the TV won't heat up as much. The 65F also had a nice black finish to it.

Also, Samsung was willing to fix it (within the 1 year warranty).The bigger issue with this set, and many from this timeframe made by Samsung, are the power supply issues that these models had, where after a year or so, just out of the warranty period, the TV would labor to turn on, and then eventually not turn on at all. The complaint with the set is that they obviously chose either cheap components (basic 50-cent capacitors) or they designed the set incorrectly so that decent components can't handle the load. After seeing the internal guts of my TV, as I was forced to go in there and put in new capacitors, I'm going with the first choice: I think they chose cheap capacitors because of packaging constraints. You can fix it (there are many sites out there dedicated to fixing the power supply issue), but seriously, wouldn't it be better to design it right in the first place? And when Samsung admits there's a problem, but refuses to fix it, that doesn't sit well with me, either.So in short, this TV has everything you'd want in terms of picture: in short, I think it's amazing. But the quality problems will get you, eventually. Just know that Samsung's customer service isn't so great. Because of that alone, this is probably the last Samsung set I purchase. This is one model where buying a refurb'ed set might be a good idea....find out what they did to it.

The added benefit of a 46\" or larger screen is for use with a computer.  You simply need as big a display as you can afford to make it easy to use across the room.If you have any plans on hooking up a PC to a Hi Def screen, you must go for the 1080P screens since PCs are very difficult to use when limited to a 720 line display.  A lot of web sites assume that the PC at least displays 768 lines, but they look better at the higher resolutions.I originally shopped for 40\" screens, but I'm very glad I went with the larger screen.  I know a smaller screen would be a bit more frustrating to use for occasional web surfing.The display on this model is very good!  It's bright, and the contrast ration is very good.  I have this mounted in a sunny living room and the picture is never washed out or tough to see, even at an angle.  I did find the display to have very bright reds, but I either got used to them, or they toned down.  While I think red is still a tad bit brighter than the other colors, it's not distracting.I also did a lot of research on the AVSForums and never ran into any issues people may have mentioned.  I do find Samsung to be a great choice in the price to quality ratio.  They really seem to have a good handle on what the consumer wants instead of dictating what we must use.

There are a few issues (explained below), but if you are considering purchasing this TV, it is definately a good buy.Note: TV was color calibrated from the default settings.

Compared to my old TV which was stolen, an Olevia 337H 37\" LCD HD Ready Monitor, the lines added from a 1080p screen are easily noticed. However, it's this fact that also fuels some of the newer negative reviews for this TV (especially the later models made this year which feature a newer, but poorer performing Cortez board). I can't speak for all content providers out there, but for Dish Network, not all of the HD content is in 1080i. In some cases, you get mixed content (in that the show is in one resolution and the commercials are across the board in various resolutions). The result is HD that looks good at one momement and completely terrible at another. For comparison with the 720p Olevia I had:720p on Olevia - Content looks great720p on Samsung - Content looks good, you can tell that picture is upconverted as MPEG square pixelation is noticeable1080i on Olevia - Content looks like 720p1080i on Samsung - Content looks great1080p on Olevia - Content does not display as screen cannot handle 1080p1080p on Samsung - Content looks greatStandard Viewing:As with most LCD HDTVs, looking at standard definition content results in a poorer quality picture. This is due to the fact that LCD screens have only one native resolutions (unlike CRT and DLP) and do not scale well with other resolutions. With my older TV, watching standard definition was poorer. On the Samsung, standard definition can range from absolutely terrible to just plain old terrible. In my setup, I watch standard definition in 4:3 mode (set from my Dish Receiver). While the picture isn't stretched to wide screen, the 640x480i resolutions are just to stretched on the 1920x1080p screen. It is still watchable, but don't expect it to blow you away. After all, standard definition is not the intent of this TV. For comparison:480i on Olevia - Ok picture480i on Samsung - Terrible picture480p on Olevia - Ok picture480p on Samsung - Better than 480i, but still terribleBlu-ray, Apple TV, and Xbox 360:Watching Blu-ray movies on this screen is almost indescribable. Native 1080p content shines on this screen. You have to almost see it to believe it. With native Apple TV content (movies and rented SD), the picture is about what you would get with what I described 480p above. With Apple TV HD and my own personal digitized DVD collection (all have been rescaled to be anamorphic), the picture is slightly better than what was stated for 720p (there isn't noticeable MPEG pixelation). For my Xbox 360 (TV in Game Mode), the game play is much better than my Olevia was. Some of the older games that are 720p can be noticed a bit, but my Call of Duty 4 and Gears of War are awesome when played on the Samsung.Issues with the unit:While the TV is very good (which is why there are 4 stars given), it does have a few issues that may bother some of you.Anynet+ - I have yet to be able to get Anynet+ to work with my TV and Receiver. Both support Anynet+ and can be detected, but I cannot control it from the TV's remote.Multi-upconversions - The TV upconverts anything that is not 1080p. While this is good for lower definition content as it helps to make the content look better, the TV will also upconvert 1080p content as well. Upconverting MPEG video too much can lead to pixelation.Single Tuner PIP - The PIP function does not allow for you to view multiple channels (if using cable, for example). Rather, the PIP allows for you to view multiple sources. So, if you are watching something on the HDMI port, you can hit the PIP button and watch something on the tuner. Likewise, PIP will only show you something on the tuner. You cannot have PIP show you something on another input.Detailed Adjustments Not Available in Dynamic Mode - If you have the screen set to dynamic mode for for the picture, you cannot modify any of the detailed picture settings.

It took me almost a month to sit down and finally spend a greatdeal of time with this set. Unfortunately, the result is quitedisappointting. The first thing i realized was that most of the HDchannels don't look sharp at all as many others have pointed out. Truethat not all HD channels are in 1080i but usually you can tell the diffright away between a regular and a hd channel right away. But not on thisset. For cable viewing, i noticed quite a bit of static in thebackground, which can be quite distracting. When it comes to hooking upto my PS3, the picture and color on the NBA 2k8 is horrible and a lot ofmotion blur. I highly doubt if it has anything to do with not beingproperly calibrated. Lastly, the contrast ratio of 15,000:1 to 10,000:1is really not something you can tell with bare eyes.

Going into it my main concern was the reflection factor that has been mentioned. The TV is in my basement which has a low ceiling (i.e. the lights are low so could reflect) however I am not aware of them at all.I mainly use the TV to watch soccer and movies so a diverse use.I started looking at 50\" and almost had my mind up, but then considered a 46\". On hindsight I could have gone with the 50\" and only saw the idea to make a cut out of the dimensions, and hung it up about where the TV would be afterwards. (i.e. tape lots of pieces of paper together to see how the TV will look in the space you are going to have it).Another suggestion is go to the store and look at it as often they will have your choices and the sales people (circuit city) were helpful even though I was upfront and said I am not buying it from them as I had Amazon coupons.The TV has a lot of inputs and you don't need my review of them, the only comment I have is if you are in a tight space it is a bit hard to get all the plugs into the back of the TV but that should just be a one time hassle.If you have another Samsung the remote is pretty much the same except response is slow. I think that is b/c the TV infra is small so you have to be pointing to the bottom corner of the TV to work.

And like many, I wasn't comfortable clicking the ORDER button with a credit card amount this large. But it was painless - all except order tracking (more on this). Got both an email and personal phone call from my credit card company the next day, wanting me to verify the order (not my usual pattern I'm sure). Gave my thanks and told them to keep it up.Product is great - larger than I realized. At first I thought I was back in the old days of drive in movies (I miss those!). Delivery left a lot to be desired, took 8 days from Ohio to Iowa, coulda walked that fast. Online tracking is a joke, doesn't change for days on end, sometimes no info avail. But Eagle finaly did call, set up a delivery time, met that fine. They were a day earlier than projected. Two boys and a truck arrived, carried it in, unboxed it but suggested not to turn it on until it climitized to the house (it was cold and damp outside). As long as I had the 30 day return policy I was OK with that, told me to save the carton in case of a return (otherwise $50 repackaging fee).Lot's of confusion on cable vs satellite, local cable says I gotta have their \"digital\" package in order to unscramble thier HD signals, but gee, sorry, we're out of boxes for now.So I scanned the over the air (OTA) broadcast signals without an antenna, got zilch. I'm 23 mi from local towers. Tried a cheapie set of rabbit ears, and hey - got about 10. Some not useable, 5 or 6 \"OK\". Local PBS station came in at 1080i signal, about KNOCKED my socks off - a tour of Germany that almost stunned me. Then I hooked up a 30 yr old anntenna from my attic and doubled my OTA stations, a mix of 4xxi, 720i, and 1080i signals. You have to \"resize\" many to fit the 16:9 format.At night I increase my energy saver mode, reducing the intensity of the picture, actually easier on the eyes.Summary - super product, huge screen, glare isn't an issue, if you're on cable be prepared to pay more (but it's worth it). Local satellite says they have more digital stations but in Iowa the local stations (HD) aren't yet delivered in HD - \"they are working on it, late Fall maybe?\".

Standard picture is good enough.- I find the sound of this TV to be more than adequate and room filling. I do, however, use the surround speakers when watching DVDs or playing games.- I found connecting this TV to PS3 super easy. Also this TV lets me choose different picture settings (brightness, contrast and stuff) for each input (in my case - PS3 and Cable) and REMEMBERS it.- I had read a lot about reflective screen and glare issues - to be frank, there is some glare when watching with all windows open - but I dont think its that big a deal. Definitely not a deal-breaker!- One wierd thing: This TV displays more cable channels than my older 21\" tube TV does. Both the TVs are presently connected to cable using a co-axial splitter and this TV displays as many as 120 channels while the older TV displays only 55. I dont know if its due to some in-built tuner but I am not complaining :)So far - I havent found anything in this TV that I dont like.One last thing - During my researching process before buying this TV, the Best-Buy guy told me that Samsung builds LCDs for Sony.

This problem lasts for around 30 minutes until the TV is warmed up.  This is a well-documented problem on the internet.  In fact here is a link to a forum whereby someone posted pictures of their own TV that could look almost exactly like mine.[...]When I spoke to Samsung Executive Customer Service, I was informed that they would not pay for a tech rep to come to my house to repair the TV.  This is a major problem because as the person in the forum noted, Samsung is no longer making the LCD panel for my TV that is likely the source of the problem.  In fact, customer service told me that even if the rep came out to repair the TV and determined that the LCD panel was the cause of the problem and confirmed that the panel was no longer available, I would still be responsible for the $60 diagnosis fee.This was the worst experience with customer service that I have ever had.

Bagci \"WK\"", "ReviewID": "R3APDNNU5IJT0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought this TV from Best Buy for $2,519 (plus tax and $80 in s&h;). That was just last week. Literally hours after the purchase, BB announced that they increased the price of this TV to $2,699 including free shipping and a $399 chair for free. I went back to the store and asked for the new deal as the TV had not been delivered yet, and I was told to cancel the order and re-order online.Before placing the order online, I decided to check Amazon's price on this item and was amazed to see that Amazon listed the TV for $2,199 with free shipping and no sales tax. That's a price difference of over $500.So, I dropped the BB idea and ordered from Amazon. The TV arrived 3 days ahead of schedule (ordered Sep 13, received Sep 18). Eagle Global was excellent to deal with.The TV was flawless right out of the box. I read many stories of this TV dropping HDMI connections when used with a Playstation 3, but I didn't have such issues after using it with a PS3 for over 4 hours last night. The problem is supposed to occur a lot more frequent than that.I was once again impressed by the true blacks that the TV generates. The other colors just pop out. Watching 1080p native resolution via PS3 was a pleasure. 3 HDMI inputs are great. I am seriously considering to disconnect my Denon receiver and connect my cable box, PS3 and DVD player straight to the TV. 3 HDMI inputs mean 3 cables for 3 devices as HDMI carries sound and video over a single cable. Time to say goodbye to my endless collection of 3-pronged component cables and accompanying fiber-optic cables.The cable-box performance was great as well. The regular broadcasts appear just as good as any other media (DVD, PS3,etc.). I also connected my personal computer to this TV via DVI-HDMI adapter and was surprised with the flicker-free, solid image with wonderful color accuracy.The TV is very easy to operate. The most difficult part of the setup was to remove the base stand (as I had to hang it on my wall). The stand is attached to the TV with 4 screws which are pretty difficult to remove. After they get loose they just tend to stay in their deep socket. You have to turn the TV over and gently give it a tap or two to get the screws to fall out. After that, the stand comes out easily.The wall mount was not an issue. the TV is lighter than comparable plasma screens, making it easier to mount on the wall. I used the thin-profile Sanus system that (for about $150).I haven't even started getting into all the image settings with this unit yet. All I know is that it offers a wide range of user-adjustable settings.All in all, I am extremely satisfied with the purchase and at this stage, I don't have anything negative to say about the unit. It looks beautiful as well. The shiny casing is prone to fingerprints and smudges but as it's currently mounted on a wall, I don't think it will be a problem to keep it clean.Highly recommended.", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "pleased", "Author": "C.

JR's salesman lied to me about the shipping time said I would get in 4 to 6 business days but I didn't get it till two and a half weeks later after I called them many times. I also felt deceived about the warranty, the salesman sold me a five year warranty but when I got it turns out it's only four year because the first year is covered by Samsung but I wasn't to upset seeing as I was about to buy it at best buy for 3199 plus tax and with the warranty and shipping I paid a total of 2900 no tax.  When I got the set I was really impressed the picture. The blu rays were outstanding.  The high def cable channels were awesome.  Not to mention the unit looked really sexy in my house.  The second week I had it the screen turned hot pink, turned it off and on and it was fine then later that night it turned black the said searching for signal again I turned it off and on and it was fine for a couple hours. Then it flashed hot pink, snow, black, picture over and over till again I turned it off and on again. All these problems occur at least once a night.  There have been other flashing screen issues which are very annoying, I called Samsung and they sent someone over a week later to switch out the tuner and power supply (which is pretty much all the major parts in the TV you can swap out other than the screen) in my two week old TV.  The tech just left so hopefully this will solve the problem.  The reason I gave the product 3 stars is when it was working properly it really was a beautiful picture and I hooked my PC up to it and that was fun and looked awesome.

On top of that, the TV has flickering, blurry and fuzzy picture with fast motion video like running and racing.When I called SAMSUNG company, they were not very helpful, saying this kind of damage is not covered. After many calls, I have to talk to manager who arranged technician visit for software upgrade for moving objects picture issue and also to verify the damage. The technician  evaluated the TV box, took pictures of the TV and determined that it was a factory originated damage and reported back to Samsung. Since then, I have been struggling and wasted so many hours over the phone to make support people at Samsung understand the issue. I must say that Samsung has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. They try to ignore the facts, delay or furhter complicate it so that you are frostrated. First of all, their support people have no clue about the problem, then they transfer to another dept where hold time is more than one hour. The ECR dept personale are very rude and cold.

I thought it was the next best thing since sliced bread for the first 13 months we owned it and then it just gave up the ghost.  The colors went from being the most mesmerizing thing I had seen on TV to grainy blocks of magenta, green and blue.I contacted Samsung.  The TV was a month past warranty.  I was referred to a shop for repair.  They said they thought it was the main board and would order replacement parts.  Several weeks went by.  I called.  They have cancelled my repair ticket without explanation.  They are the only Samsung recommended repair shop in our state and they dont want to touch this TV.I now own a $2200 piece of unusable crap.

Here is my story. I ordered a Samsung LNT4665F on Aug, 8th, and started tracking my shipment ever since. on 9th, it suddenly occured to me that I haven't updated my account's phone number, and it could be a problem, for the shipping carrier might not be able to contact me. So I updated my phone number on 9th, and immediately send amazon customer service an email, letting them notify the carrier about the change. I got response the second day saying it will be handled properly. But as a IT guy, I know how error prone this exception handling could be, so I sent them another letter urging them to make sure it's being handled properly, this time I didn' get a respose for several days. and In the meanwhile, the shipment arrived at my city in the early morning on Aug.14th. On Aug 15th, I finally got a email from Amazon telling me they have already informed carrier EGL about my phone number, so I was waiting for their call anytime. but until 19th, 5 days after the TV arrived at my town, I still didn't get a call. So I called Amazon this time, the rep assured me this time they would see to it that my number is given to them.  one day later, I got an email telling me it's being taken care of, and they gave me the phone number of the carrier this time, finally. I called the carrier the following Monday, Aug 20th, after being transfered to the right person, she told me that she has NEVER been given any update on my phone number, so she couldn't contact me! ...... I ended up getting my TV a on Wed, Aug 22nd, a week later than I should have.The TV is as good as all the review claims, so I enjoyed it greatly during last week, I hooked it up with an antenna and were amazed at the picture quality. But today, when I got home, I found there's no signal at all from antenna. Looking at the back of the TV, I was really surprised to see that the antenna's terminal BROKE from TV, leaving a hole there. apprently it's glued to the back of the TV, and was not glued properly. So now I am stuck with a defective TV after one week's ownership, and have to contact Customer service again for replacement.Hope it's just a bad apple I got.", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Please take my advise!", "Author": "R.

Well inside the buck/bangometer.Wierd things I don't like:The chime is ridiculous. The bigger your Samsung, the Louder your chime is when you turn it on and off (the 53\" is almost unbearable). Your other will definitely wake if they are sleeping.It also can take a few moments to turn on (like 6 seconds), whatever.FOR THE 53\" LCD ONLY: Looking at the screen from any direction other than dead-on, you will see white light bleeding and washing all around an area that is lit up. It reminds me a little of the Projector TV days.Don't forget that there is a fairly sized bright blue light directly underneath the LCD screen. I don't really see the reasoning (Sony also does this) and it's kind of annoying.You may not notice this; the image is sometimes so clear that everything looks like a sitcom. I've watched movies that look wierd on my samsung. Like I'm watching a brightly lit TV sitcom (?). I don't know how else to put it. And even though it looks a little odd, I quickly grew accustomed to this and even liked it at times.The settings are pretty sensitive. You can view something and think it looks TERRIBLE, but play around and it looks like HD. This can work for or against depending on what your watching.I had a malfunction with my Samsung but haven't heard anyone else complain of this: The processor, or something was occasionally making the video of both cable and a Blu-ray player look like stop-motion photography (like Gumby). Every few hours it would do this. I ended up trading it in for the 53\", which the jury is still out on. I can tell you that the 46\" does seem like a sharper picture than the 53\". However that could well be because it's on my bedroom wall and I can't get any further away from it.Great TV, Samsung is the lead this year. I felt that while Sony always makes a great product, Sharp, LG, Toshiba and Samsung all trade off with second place every year.
