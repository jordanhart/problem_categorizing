The TV is amazing for gaming, I noticed a lot of differences from my previous TV. For the time being this is all I can say about this TV and I don't have any issues and I hope it will continue like this, so I'll update my review if I got any issues in the future.Updated 12th October 2013:I experienced some delay when I play games, I can tell that especially with fighting games where you need instant response to perform certain actions, I switched to game mode and it worked fine but I got stuck with bad picture quality, so I reconfigured the picture and saved it as expert1, now everything is okay no delay + nice picture quality.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,499.99", "Features": "1080p FULL HD Resolution\n240hz LED HDTV\nCinema 3D Technology", "Name": "LG 55LA7400 55\" Cinema 3D Smart TV Bundle - with LG Electronics NB3530A 2.1 300w Soundbar with Subwoofer", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31bBgFXtsYL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ESUR5U6"}}
