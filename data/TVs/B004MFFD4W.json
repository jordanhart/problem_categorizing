{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great", "Author": "Shutter Bugg", "ReviewID": "R1UJ64E0IBR8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"Outstanding 3D television! Bright clear picture, smooth action, deep colors, ample amount of inputs, numerious user settings to adjust the picture to your specifications, 3D without any ghosting or bleed. The only problem I see is the angle of viewing which is 60 degrees. 30 and 30 from center but all the other brands have the same limitation. 3D glasses are comfortable and light and fit over my eyeglasses without any problem and are rechargable. Blacks are excellent and the whites are bright. The contrast ratio is not given in the specs but it appears to be somewhere between 7,000,000 and 9,000,000 to 1 dynamic. Great buy, you will not regret it!\"", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "M.

I do not have a 3D/Blu-Ray player so I cannot test out my Avatar Blu-Ray.  Sorry for not being able to go into much depth on specs but as a person who has had 4 different LCD HDTV's in the last 5 years I have to say this by far beats anything I have ever owned.  Technology is in such a boom right now that I would only recommend buying electronics if you truly will love the item and have no buyers remorse.  I have no remorse at all after buying this TV.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Sundance", "ReviewID": "R159IEV8Y0PQNW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This TV is a far cry from a GOOD one....splotchy faces, skin whites out!!  Toshiba sent a repairman, and he says there is nothing wrong with it...bull crap!!  I will never buy from them again...OMG $2,000 for this NO WAY!!  The worst part, Toshiba will NOT BACK IT UP!!!!If you buy from this seller don't wait to return it, for if you have it over their 30 day return policy, they WILL NOT ALLOW A RETURN, WON'T EVEN BEND ONE DAY!!
