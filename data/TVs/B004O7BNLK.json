The Samsung UN46D6300 46-Inch LED TV is the latest in this series. This is the highest-end of its 2D LED Line. After this 3D series starts.The Smart Hub with full Web Browser with Flash support made me buy this TV over others. It has been just five days since it came and I started using this TV. Everyday learning something new.So far I have used Smart Hub for Netflix (with HD streaming), YouTube and mostly streaming Flash videos from different sites using the Web Browser.It take a bit practice with the supplied remote to navigate thru sites and to enter URLs or search on Google page. But when I connected my HTC EVO 4G with this TV using Samsung App, Samsung Remote, things became very easy to enter because it (the App) supports full QWERTY key board in real time. BTW Samsung is coming out with a new product QWERTY Keyboard and Remote combination for those who are interested. I believe it will be priced about $100.00. I don't know weather I will buy that after having the App on my EVO.The Samsung App Store have a huge collection of Apps. The biggest help is Samsung support videos that makes life very easy without the guess work.Great picture quality in LED. Nice sound, I have not plugged it in external speaker system. Decent size for my living room (55-inch seemed a bit bigger for me).You do not get Smart Hub and Web Browsing in 2010 Models. Also all models below 6300 series in 2011 do not have Web Browsers.  I highly recommend this TV (D6300 Series) over 2010 models (C6300 Series).", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overall Great TV (Video Gamer Review Included)!", "Author": "ExtroFlashG", "ReviewID": "R2BPM7GU7TGJM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Picture is amazingMultiple HDMI inputsEasy to setupSmart TV is exceptionalCons:Remote isn't optimized for Internet use(They have a keypad-remote coming soon)Some apps missing from TVI read a boat load of reviews on a bunch of TVs and went to BestBuy on numerous occasions to figure out the perfect TV for me. I picked this TV over the D6000 because I wanted the web browser. Overall, the TV is amazing. Picture quality is excellent, I'm very impressed with the \"auto motion plus\" feature that adds frames for fast scenes. I'm a big time sports fanatic and gamer so I was really interested in this feature. You can also adjust how hard you want it to work, which is awesome. The sound quality is good, I didn't expect to be blown out of the water since all TV companies expect you to connect their TV to a home theater. You also don't need to put in special codes to adjust the RGB, it's all there in the menu for video-enthusiasts.It has a blu-ray mode that optimizes blu-rays to look their best. I saw \"Dark Knight\" in a whole new light this past week! It has a game mode that turns off all the extra processing to minimize input lag. The Smart TV function is great. It continues video in the top left corner and you can browse your apps like Netflix, Hulu Plus, Facebook, YouTube and all that awesomeness. The 6300 comes with the web browser which works well. It also allows you to watch TV and browse at the same time.The only problem I have with the TV is the remote. You can definitely tell they made the remote to frustrate you and get you to buy the new keypad. Luckily, there is an app for that on androids and iphones. Also, I'm a fitness enthusiast so I was excited that GymBox and Exercise TV came for free with the TV, however, they aren't there or available for download. My guess is that they still are rolling out all the apps since it's so new.FOR GAMERS:Game mode cuts lag down but sacrifices picture quality to do so. The game still looks good but it'll make you sad when you compare it to game mode being off. I tested out Uncharted 2, Crysis 2, Gears 3 beta, and some sports titles. With all video processing turned on, there is a definite lag, HOWEVER,  I have found out with game mode off, you can cut off LED Motion Plus and set Auto Motion Plus to custom and have it at a 1-3 depending on preference, it will still look amazing and minimize lag. I've gone online and my K/D has not suffered at all(Uncharted-1.5, Crysis-1.5-but this past week with the TV it's at around 2-3 K/D with the improved picture quality). I tested out Mortal Kombat with everything still on and it played great, I didn't go online, though.If you have a question about anything because I'm sure I forgot some cool things about the TV, leave a comment.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV with mediocre browser", "Author": "Anx", "ReviewID": "R9QZ3YL1YLGAG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV is exactly sames as the D6000 plus a web browser (I don't care much about missing a few contrast ratio). That's the sole reason of me buying this unit.The TV is GREAT and produces STUNNING picture quality! I was so happy to buy this sammy and never regret it. I guess lot of people have posted about the feature and quality of TV so I would keep it to the point.I am bit tech savvy and would like to be specific about observations. I was thinking to avoid buying Google TV (~$300) by purchasing this browser enabled TV. You need to understand that this is not a computer/smartphone however the browser loads websites very quickly even faster than some of the smartphones out there and does support flash videos however I had few issues: 1. It crashed loading some websites like HULU.com . this site loads lots of tiny flash videos ready to get played and I guess TV sometimes couldn't handle that. 2. As another reviewer mentioned it lacked sound sometimes while refreshing the page or even at beginning. I experienced it with sony's [...] and MTV. 3. I also noticed that videos were choppy on heavy websites including both Crackle and Hulu. I understand it could be due to internet connection however I am at 10Mbps and I did verify my net speed at the time of this issue.  I own a PS3 and I think the browser in a PS3 is way better than this TV. Its a pain to launch keyboard while a site is loading and TV is very sluggish, even the iPhone app remote wouldn't help much that time. Other times iPhone/Android remote app is the best for typing. Nonetheless, most of the other popular stuff like twitter, facebook, Youtube, google talk, daily motion, fandango, ESPN etc are already downloadable as an APP for this TV hence I really got to used the browser very minimally.  Other issues I found with this TV was clouding effect where all 4 edges as well as center part of screen are bit whitish and you could EASILY notice that in an average dark scene. Again I am very specific to observe and hence it may not be much of an issue for some people.  I use external speakers with this TV and there are good no of options for you to connect external speakers:  1. Audio out jack (this is what I use with my old Altec lansing speakers)  2. Optical Audio output  3. ARC (Audio return channel)  Because of these drawbacks I actually purchased the D6400 which was on a promotion and is 3D enabled. I am very happy with that TV and picture quality seems to surpass what D6300 offers in terms of smoothness and clarity. Again this is my observation and it could be different with you.  To sum it up my recommendation would be to either buy D6000 or D6400 depending upon the deal you are getting.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Image, Poor Reliability", "Author": "A. Mason", "ReviewID": "R2LV39KEHY01PE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I gave the Samsung UN40D6300 5-stars for clarity. The picture quality is simply the best I have ever seen without question. True, the motion control and extreme \"live look\" won't appeal to everyone. I welcomed the giant leap in picture quality. I'm willing to accept that the murky dark ages of imagery is about to give way to true realism.For the first two weeks of owning this Smart TV: I was astonished and delighted to near hysterics. My girlfriend wanted to be at my house every night just to gaze into it. We felt like we were experiencing something like what people did watching color TV for the first time. It came with all (but one) of the adapters I needed to set up as I had with my old LCD and I was happy. Extremely happy.Strike One: I decided to purchase the LAN adapter, the several extra ones I have didn't fit or didn't work. I was excited to browse the web and play apps on a TV. It came, got online with minimal effort, and discovered the online experience is a throwback from the days of dial up. Crippling slow, and YouTube seems limited to paid advertisements. I felt like I wasted my money on making my Smart TV smart. So did my girlfriend, who was more anxious to use it than I was.Strike Two: After a few weeks, the audio volume started dropping. At first I thought this was based on the individual programs, but soon, every program needed to be cranked to about 50 of 100 to be heard. This was annoying considering that my first impression of the audio on this LED was \"way above average\" set at about 25 of 50. I loved the picture so much, I was willing to overlook this flaw, which I shouldn't have.Strike Three: On the 28th day of owning this marvel of technology, I watched a few standard definition programs in a row. I switched back to HD programing and an alternating bar pattern was left behind on the entire left half of the screen. I updated the software. I conducted the built in picture test. It affected all sources including the Xbox 360. The light/dark bar pattern gradually faded except in the upper left corner of the screen.I returned it for a Samsung LCD 120hz and so far, 95% happy.I will check on the technology in another two years. If Samsung can add durability and product lifespan to astonishing picture quality, plus a robust high-speed internet experience, they will have a product of unmatched value.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't put too loud!!!  And buy a separate keyboard for internet", "Author": "April", "ReviewID": "R1JKXLOYXMHTTV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The company Amazon was purchasing this item from (Video & Audio Center) was very slow to ship this item.  It was going to ship in 11 business days instead of 3-5 so I cancelled the order and picked it up at Best Buy.  They were great about issuing me a credit though.  So, here are our comments about this TV:Don't get me wrong, we absolutely LOVE this TV.  However, it takes some work to get this TV right.  Here are some of the issues we've encountered and have rectified:The sound quality is horrific.  The speakers are terrible since this TV is so thin, and you absolutely need surround sound in order to hear everything properly.  We've read that this is the case for most new TV's and not just this one.  Constantly having the surround sound on is a problem with apartment living, so just be AWARE of this before you purchase this TV.  You actually cannot listen to it without surround sound because you will blow the speakers.  We couldn't put our sound past the number 14 without hearing static coming from the speakers.  We were also having some blur issues at the time so we exchanged it.  Best Buy gave us a BIG problem with this and had the geek squad hook up the TV in the store before the exchange.  They said the sound quality was fine and speakers were not blown.  We refused to keep the TV and they finally issued the exchange.The picture quality is AMAZING once you figure out the settings!  It took my fiancee about a week to play with the settings and even then he couldn't get rid of the blur issues he had when playing his PS3.  When we exchanged the TV, the geek squad gave us some helpful hints on optimizing the quality of viewing and which settings to use.  This is what they recommended: Under menu, picture, choose \"movie\" mode.  Also under menu, picture, picture options, auto motion plus, choose \"smooth\".  That helped a lot, but we tweaked the settings even further.  We changed auto motion plus to clear, and took only a few picture quality settings from the \"dynamic\" setting such as color, brightness, etc and used it under the \"movie\" mode because we felt dynamic gave you best color & picture, and movie mode the best quality with the blur issues.  So...be patient, but once you get the setting right you will be amazed!!!As for the smart TV part of this TV...you need to purchase a separate keyboard & box that communicates with the keyboard.  Using the smart TV through the standard TV controller will make you pull your hair out!!!  I still have to hook up the keyboard because the first time I tried there was a communication issue with our wireless router.  Once it's hooked up, I will definitely use the internet more.  It's pretty cool to watch my favorite youtube video's on this gigantic TV!!!  The internet gets a bit tripped up once in a while, but so far I've solved this issue by taking out the USB wifi cable and moving it to another USB port on the TV.  Seems to be much faster now", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "What I expected from Samsung...", "Author": "John A.", "ReviewID": "R1D8FBMIY9SQP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a terrific TV with outstanding image quality, a sleek appearance, good feature set, and is very easy to use. I was a very loyal Sony TV customer until I bought my first Samsung 6 years ago - and that was a 56\" DLP projection screen 1080P unit that I have never regretted buying.I have this unit installed outdoors under a covered patio; my only real complaint with the unit is the glossy screen and associated glare, which I believe is just the case with any LED television.I also purchased the UN40D6000 unit for our upstairs family room unit, and am very happy with that unit as well - in fact probably moreso. I love the Samsung TV apps on both, but bought the 6300 on the 46\" for outside because of the full Internet browser capability. It is okay, but is Virtually useless if all you have is the included remote. I have an iPad with the Samsung TV remote app, which works nicely as it has a virtual keyboard feature. You could also purchase the QWERTY remote (is it available yet?) but then you are getting into spending some considerable additional $$ for the Internet browser TV feature, and it's not THAT important to me.I have an iPad with the Samsung network remote app installed (so I have access to a virtual keyboard that way) and that is okay. (I really do like having the Samsung TV remote app for the iPad for other reasons, too)Bottom line, this is a fantastic TV at a very good price... Outstanding picture quality, sleek appearance, and very cool Samsung TV Internet apps. If I had it to do over, though - I would save the $$ and buy the UN40D6000. The full Internet browser is not worth the $ for me.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding TV!", "Author": "P. Malone", "ReviewID": "R3CO4FK1NCSLB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research on televisions before purchasing the D6300.  Then, spent a lot of time at Best Buy comparing picture quality, which is pretty useless by the way, as Best Buy hooked all of their TV's up via coax cable, and the pictures aren't as sharp as they could be.Setting up the unit was amazingly easy, without a single problem or glitch. I wall mounted the unit, using a low profile mounting bracket, and with the 1.2\" thickness of the TV, it only protrudes about two inches from the wall.  And, playing blu-ray vids shows you how phenomenal the picture is.I read the rest of the reviews here, and some of the negative comments baffle me.  The viewing angle on the TV is great!  I can watch the TV at almost 90 degrees off center with no loss of quality.  And, when connecting the TV to a newer amp, you can control the amp as well as the TV with the remote.One of the best features of this TV is the two way audio, (only available on HDMI 2).  When you are accessing the built in apps on the TV, the sound is automatically routed back through the HDMI cable to the amp and you don't have to use the TV speakers.Overall, I have zero complaints about the TV and am completely satisfied.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Brij", "ReviewID": "R3OPF7X0GGX53Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only difference between UN40D6300 and UN40D6000 is the built in web browser.There are many web sites which i can watch and stream movies.

The TV worked great right out the box, easy to set up, great picture quality, web browser is sweet! However, I found the following things which compelled me not to give it 5 stars-Remote - It comes with a web browser but no QWERTY keyboard. It can be very frustrating browsing internet with a virtual keyboard. I got around this issue by using Samsung Remote App for my iPhone but would have liked to see the QWERTY keyboard included with my $1200+ TV.-Speakers - Built-in speakers are pretty bad but I guess that is any LED TV. I can imagine how difficult it must be to fit a nice set of speakers in a 1\" thick TV. I went out and bought a soundbar for additional 100 bucks. It sounds great now!-Samsung Apps- Missing a couple f Apps that I would have liked. For example, app for Willow TV is advertised on Samsung's website and this TV is listed as compatible. However, it is missing for this device and I can't download it. Samsung Apps are very inconsistent across devices. Can't do much about this...Overall, I am happy with my purchase.

The only reason to buy this TV over other Samsung models is because it comes with a web browser.  I couldn't get the web browser to fire up.  It spins a bit and then the TV reboots.Samsung support is polite but clueless.  First I tried e-mail and they told me to clear my browser cache, delete temporary internet files, or try a different browser.  It took three e-mails for them to realize I was speaking about the browser on the TV - not my PC.  They asked me to call it in.Calling it in was a waste of time.  She kept giving me instructions for Internet @ TV (old version of apps) instead of SmartHub.  In the end she told me to upgrade to the latest version of SmartHub and to download it from the web.  I explained that I had already upgraded the firmware but she said I needed to upgrade SmartHub.So off I go and of course there is no upgrade on the web for SmartHub - it's part of the firmware.  Yet another call back and this time they want to send someone out.  She couldn't really explain how sending someone out was going to fix it.I'll be returning this to Amazon and buying the cheaper model without the web browser.  No point in paying for features that don't work.Update: I'm on my second one - returned the first one to Amazon.  The web browser does work on this one (although I did not update the firmware just in case).  The web browser is mediocre but at least it works.

I'll break my review into sections:Paul's TV - 5 Stars - We ordered from Paul's TV fulfilled through Amazon so 2-day shipping was free with Prime Membership.  Ordered it on a Sunday and had it on Tuesday or Wednesday. Very happy!  :)Ease of Assembly - 5 Stars - Two of us had it together in just a few minutes. Just an aside, I love the swivel stand.  Turns just enough to get rid of any glare that comes in from the two windows in the room.Picture Quality - 5 Stars - No cable here, and even with just an antennae, it looks great.  I didn't like the picture settings so I went to CNET's forums and used a combination of some recommended settings.  Got rid of the soap opera effect and love the picture.Samsung TV Apps - 3.5 Stars - For me, Netflix is the most important app and it works quite well.  I've noticed that it works better when I run a cable into the LAN port instead of using the wireless.  It's close enough to my router so that's no big deal.  I've also used Pandora, Hulu Plus, You Tube, etc. and they work well.  My biggest concern is that Samsung has their own app store and that probably means it won't get as much attention as it would if they partnered with Google. Time will tell.Built In Web Browser - 2.5 stars - We knew this wasn't going to compare to a browser on a computer and we were right.  It's functional but a bit inconsistent with response time to load pages and videos.  We have some newspaper sites saved as favorites and it works fine to do basic surfing.

Talk about awkward... weirdness #2.  I also did not get any text notifications that I signed up for until 30 minutes after it was delivered.Ok, enough about that...Lets talk about the TV.  Out of the box it looks beautiful, elegant and stylish. This TV is made to be wall mounted, the stand doesn't do it justice. Initial setup was fairly easy. The back of the TV is totally HDMI oriented so, if you have composite or A/V cables there are 2 adapters that come with the TV that have to be used. no big deal, but different. I plugged in the wireless adapter during the setup and was connected in minutes.Picture quality for cable HD channels and Blue-Ray movie was amazing. Colors were rich and crisp detail gave it a nearly 3d feel during parts of the Blue-Ray movie.  I haven't done much gaming or watched any sports yet so jury is still out on the blur effect but out of the box settings seemed adequate. The sound works and gets loud if you turn it up...not much more you can ask for with this type of TV and I use external speakers anyway. (btw..there is a movie setting for the speakers that adds some depth to the sound if you are going to use them)I was very excited about the Smart interface when I first opened it. The initial interface is nice with big icons and fairly easy navigation. The apps store was interesting and very much like what you see on your smart phone with a nice variety of apps...pretty slick I must say.The absolute worst thing about this TV is the browser. I am an I/T guy and this totally awful to try to navigate. My guess is they did this on purpose to get people to buy the keyboard. I won't go into detail, but my only option to make this usable was to take 10 mins...yes 10 mins to enter my top 5 websites and save them under favorites so I don't have to type if I ever decided to use the browser. Browser aside the rest of the internet experience with the TV was very good. I was even able to setup Samsung Allshare on my pc (Had to call customer support to locate the software) and was able to stream movies and photos to the TV directly from my pc. Very cool feature once you step through it a couple of times.All in all this TV was exactly what I expected.

Went with the free shipping and got it within a week.  It even came with the Samsung Wireless adapter - a $50 value.  (I haven't been able to hook up the Wi-Fi yet.  I will update this post when i can)  The picture is great on all channels.  Even makes regular analog broadcasts look better.  The HD channels are amazing.  Make sure you have a cable box with an HDMI output so that you can run an HDMI cable from the box to the TV.  I especially love watching sports on this TV.  I haven't noticed any blurring with the fast action like i noticed on my friend's plasma TV.  I would say that the sound isn't that great, but that seems to be a design problem with a lot of these HDTVs - the speakers are in the back and that doesn't make for great sound projection.  Its ok for watching regular TV shows but if you want to watch a movie, you should definitely hook this TV up to some kind of external speaker system like a front sound bar or surround sound system.  I have an older HTIB and I ran cables from the TV through that system and it sounds great.  By the way, I wasn't sure which cable to use to hook up this TV to my HTIB and I went to my favorite cable site - Monoprice.com - and emailed them with the make and model of my TV and told them what i wanted to do and they emailed me back within a day with a recommendation for the exact cables I needed (which were under $5!).  I would have given this TV 5 stars except i took away one star for the difficulty of the menu system which is ok but which buries some functions in several layers of the main menu and also having some problems hooking up the wi-fi.

So far so good. Without being redundant of many of the reviews previous to mine, after using this for about a month, I believe I made an excellent choice. The picture is excellent with many adjustments available to fine tune if you find it necessary. The default 'Auto Motion Plus' feature is a bit much and have changed it to the 'clear' option. The sound is quite good but I rely on an external sound system to enhance the experience. The remote is very responsive, something I noticed immediately compared to the TV this replaced (Older HD Vizio) but does leave a bit to be desired when using with the browser function. I would say also that the browser, although useful, remains the TV's weakest link. I had a lot of difficulty viewing videos from some websites using the browser. It worked intermittently and not dependably. I can only hope software upgrades in the future improve this. I don't see why it couldn't.The apps available are plentiful but again hope and expect the number available to greatly increase in the future. I can think of many potential sites like ESPN3 where an app would be an obvious popular add on. I have long ago done away with cable and it's bill and rely on OTA local network stations in glorious HD (and free). Along with the available apps like Netflix, Hulu and VUDU, I have more than enough to watch for minimal cost. A Smart TV makes going without cable a logical choice and a trend in the making.I have made 2 inquires to Samsung about features on the TV via email and their response was within 24hrs each time. That is also important. All that is left is hope that they continue to add new apps when they are available and that the TV lasts longer than my previous TV lasted. So far, it has been a very positive experience.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "good picture, horrendous web experience", "Author": "jfb", "ReviewID": "R39Y2K1BJKR4OZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Imagine the quality of a typical Apple product.  Now, imagine the opposite and you'll have an idea of what this so-called SMART TV is like.  The picture is great, but if you're buying a SMART TV you're paying extra for the web features, which in this case are terrible.  Perhaps if you're only interested in Netflix or Hulu, it's OK, but if you want to browse the web then you should buy something else.First of, it is VERY slow, with choppy videos, as mentioned by several other reviews.  According to one of the tech support folks on their help line, this is because the browser connects to a server in Korea.  I have no idea if he's right, but it seems plausible given the slow speed. Maybe this is also why the pointer is so hard to move around the screen.  It really is painful to use.Second, it doesn't come with the QWERTY keyboard remote, instead you get a more-or-less standard remote and if you want to browse to a web address (or type anything in to a web page) you have to use the multi-tap cell-phone texting method (press '2' three times for the letter 'c' and so on).  AWEFUL!!  The web page says that the QWERTY keyboard remote is compatible with this TV (for an extra $99), but tech support says it's not.  Who knows?!Lastly, the browser is not compatible with Adobe Flash.  This too seems ridiculous, but in my experience it was true and the tech support guy confirmed it.I don't suppose the shipping is free when you return something, I can only imagine how much this is going to cost to send back.Someday this technology will work at the $1000 price range, but today is not that day.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV for a great price", "Author": "Penitent1", "ReviewID": "R3NSNAIP4VGRX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall this is an outstaning TV.

I did a lot of internet research and knew I wanted LED, non-3D, and 40-49\" screen size based on the wall unit in the room where we placed this TV.  I like Samsung products and am very, very happy with this purchase thus far.I am connecting this TV to a new Samsung Blu-Ray wifi-enabled DVD player, a Denon receiver (pre-HDMI), and some high-quality bookshelf speakers and subwoofer, so am not utilizing the TV's built-in sound capabilities for the audio, nor am I using its internet browsing capabilities (doing so thru the wifi Blu-Ray player).  However, if you're going to spend $1000+ on a TV, you really need to hook it up to a home theater system to truly enjoy the experience of watching, say, the BBC's Planet Earth series on this big, beautiful screen and hearing the audio thru a high-quality entertainment system anyway.  So I'm not too picky about the TV's built-in speakers, as other reviewers may be.  Also, I assume the browsing/Netflix capabilities I can see via my Samsung Blu-Ray player are reasonably similar to what I'd see using this Samsung TV's browsing capabilities, and all I can say is, it works the way I got used to accessing Netflix using my Nintendo Wii on my old Sony box.  I don't have a very strong opinion one way or the other about Samsung's apps, or the browser interface, etc..  As far as I'm concerned, this TV does far more than any TV I've ever owned before, so it's all gravy!I believe you can get accessories for this TV to make it 3D-capable, but I don't plan to watch my home TV with 3D glasses on or endure the inevitable headaches (literal and figurative) associated with 3D TV.  What I do care about is having a TV that has a great picture, looks attractive in our wall unit, and has features that I can grow into as needed.

I use this TV for every-day TV, sports (football mostly) and movies.  The picture is bright and contrast is very good.  Viewing angle is not bad, but the colors do tend to wash out a bit after maybe 50-60 degrees off center, especially when displaying a brighter picture.  Football looks great on it and one of the first things I watched a baseball game which was absolutely awesome looking.I did have to spend a little time to adjust some settings for things I found a bit annoying out of the box.  The \"Eco Solution\" settings would adjust the picture brightness based on room lighting and would dim the picture way too much with the default settings.  The good news is it provides ample adjustment to limit how much it dims as well as the ability to turn it off completely.  I also had to adjust brightness, contrast, etc. to look good in my environment and to suit my tastes, but that is not uncommon.  The other odd behavior I found was when watching shows with the constant (and annoying, IMHO) camera movement like \"Law and Order\".  The movement of characters in the show looked very unnatural and almost had a weird 3D effect.  I found that adjusting the Auto Motion Plus to the \"Clear\" setting improved this quite a bit and I don't notice it any more.  Again they provide a few knobs to turn to adjust this to your preference.While I didn't buy a TV for internet apps, they are rather cool.  I use Pandora quite a bit and it's great.  The Social TV would probably be pretty cool for those into social networking since you can watch TV and mess around on Facebook at the same time.  I'm not much into this stuff and I still found it to be a nice feature.  The Smart Hub user interface is a bit clunky but gets the job done.  The internet browser is useless without a way to point-and-click.  Entering text for web sites or logging into online services is painful without some type of keyboard.  I downloaded the Samsung Smart TV remote app for my iPod Touch and that works pretty well, but still is quirky at times.The controls on the front of the TV are absolutely useless.  The controls are on the lower-right front of the TV.  These are not buttons, but are touch sensitive areas in the bezel with no defined borders and the silk-screening is virtually impossible to see with the TV on and without bright lighting in the room.  Keep the remote handy.Overall, I'd give a 4.5+ star rating for picture quality.  I'd give it a 5 if not for the viewing angle.I'd give a 3.5 star rating for everything else...mostly needing improvement in user interface.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not What Represented", "Author": "DenverTechy", "ReviewID": "R3ATT6CSK7N6KO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a 46 inch Samsung 8000 that works very well.

I hooked up the 6300 to my wireless internet and got NetFlix, etc., but when you tried to use the browser the set just reboots and goes back to regular television.  Samsung was absolutly no help.  Their tech/service department had no idea what they were talking about.  After being on the telephone with them (at least three different \"techs\") for over an hour, I finally talked to someone who at least sounded like she knew what she was talking about.  But all she said was that there was a software problem with the set and they were working on a solution.  So why didn't the previous 3 people know this and how can a reputable merchant sell a TV that doesn't have a feature that they advertise and for which they charge $100 more?  It's been over 30 days and they still don't have the software fix.  Until Samsung gets their act together, I would suggest not purchasing their products.

I did buy the keyboard quewry remote on ebay for 39$ vs. $100 from Samsung. When I use smart TV it is very helpful to type with. Without it you will be very frustrated. The web browser I do not use at all. It is WAY TOO SLOW. I use Netflix, Pandora & BBC news thus far and you can not use regular HULU only Hulu plus which you pay for. It can network to your computer wireless to view photos and videos on your hard drive to view on the big screen. The bottom line is smart tv needs to get faster and easier to use. 99% of the time I hook up my laptop with an HDMI cable and use it as a big monitor. I have a wireless keyboard and mouse. I still can get Netflix, Pandora, regular Hulu and all other news broadcast via the internet. I do not have cable tv as I think it is a waste of money.

And if you want to pay for streaming video movies, you can get individual movies, such as \"Moneyball\" for $3.99, or you can sign up for monthly subscriptions from Hulu Plus or Netflix ($7.99/mo).As for me, I doubt I will ever use the internet feature, unless I switch my Netflix account from DVD to streaming video - But that is unlikely, since the top 8 (or more) movies on my DVD list currently are unavailable on streaming video.So compare: The big difference between the UN46D6300 (reviewed here) and the UN46D6000 is that the 6300 has limited internet capability.  But at today's Amazon prices (Feb 14, 2012), the 6300 is about 20% ($200) more expensive, and to use the internet capability, it also needs a minimum of $150 in additional hardware.If I had to do it over, I would buy the UN46D6000, and save $350.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Renee", "ReviewID": "R1XPYGVIS8D5S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like our new Samsung TV.

The LED LCD technology presents a picture that is the equal of a plasma TV. Did a lot of comparing before buying and the Samsung is the best of the lot right now.  However, there are two issues; namely, the need to get both an adapter and a qwerty remote control above the cost of the TV.  Read carefully because it says \"WiFi ready\" and not \"WiFi\".  You have to purchase an adapter that is essentially an antenna to connect to the WiFi.  And an additional qwerty remote control to practically use the internet.  So the TV was not so \"SMART\" without addional expense.  Example: I also purcased a VIZIO this year that came with both WiFi and a qwerty remote.  For the price of the Samsung it should have also, in my opinion.  But still a great picture and the bells and whistles are fun. And I continue to be amazed at dealing with Amazon.

The only thing i will sasy that was a drawback at first, I was playing Dead Island(new game with great graphics) on my PS3 and the screen was sketchy when you moved fast, so you have to turn off the Auto Motion Plus. It works wonders on regular tv or movie watching but doesnt like the video games much. But once i turned this off the game looked better than ever.

Watching over the air broadcast HD is amazing, especially while watching sports - e.g., US Open finals.I have to admit I did little research, since I knew I wanted Samsung, and 46\" only (not bigger). I didn't want a 3D either, but wanted the top of the line in 2D. This model was the best 2D in 46\". It had web browser - the only difference above the 6000 model. So decided to go with it using Amazon prime and never disappointed!It's best for playing blu-ray movies and broadcast HD. The smart hub and apps are fine, but the user interface for navigating is clunky - too many clicks. Youtube app is especially bad, with a broken interface for typing and searching. They don't have amazon instant videos app too - surprising. Didn't matter too much for me, as I use streaming through the Sony blu-ray player, but something to improve for Samsung. I liked their Netflix app though.Using web browser is also a pain, but it's just a novelty and experiment at this stage.

Swivel base is convenient for me and I consider a great option to have for a TV where wall mounting is nice, but unnecessary.  Lots of simple and easy connections, e.g. router internet cable, cable TV, blu-ray HDMI all work fine and audio out to older Amp super good.  Audio on TV very good too, just don't need it.  Over years Samsung apps have gotten better, but still sort of clumsy in my opinion.  A Roku or Apple TV will give somewhat better feel, just depends on type and degree of home integration you want to achieve.  This was a black friday purchase, I think 2 years ago?, and price point very good.  The 52\" is running fine after >5 years.CONSDelivery was a problem.  I put a hold on delivery with UPS because I was out of town.  When returned found TV sitting in its native box with advertising on my front steps.  I gotta be kidding, right?  No.  I live in a safe neighborhood, but very unhappy sitting in elements for nearly two days.  So, I complained to UPS.  But, also I would hope Amazon would have boxed item shipped inside another box with additional padding.

It does pull up online videos, which was part of the function I needed.  It is light and has great sound.However at the 11 month mark the TV powered off and would not turn on.  The light next to the power button flashed in sets of two and I live-chatted with Samsung online support.  After freezing out of 4 chats, plugging and unplugging, I was told that since I live in a large city in Mexico (incidentally the country where the TV was made) the warranty will not cover parts and in-home service because I bought the TV on Amazon.com (US) and it was shipped here.  Even though there are contracted/certified Samsung techs less than 5 minutes from my house the warranty will not cover.  Therefore I went to Sears (where they have certified tech support) paid the fee for an in-home diagnosis and the tech tells me that the part will cost me $600.00 USD.  I have limited options.  If I mail the TV to the US for service, it will cost me several hundred dollars for shipping and insurance.  Basically either way, I'm out half the cost of the television.I found on line that this is a common problem with these televisions and that after resisting Samsung decided to pay service and parts admitting the glitch.  However that doesn't help me in the slightest.I expect a product such as this to function longer than a year and that a company such as Samsung to work with customers to solve the problem for products under warranty.My ticket was referred to a contractor in the US who asked me to ship the TV to him.

This might not be too visible in a bright environment. In a dim environment (my case), I managed to bring it down to an acceptable level by dimming the backlight.- Buttons on the remote are flush, which makes it hard to figure them out by touch. Really annoying. This seems to be a problem with all recent Samsung remotes (I had a Samsung BD player - which I also returned for other reasons - with a very similar remote).- I could not find a way to make the TV automatically switch between full aspect ratio - for widescreen (16:9) signals - and pillarbox (black vertical bars on each side) for standard (4:3) signals. I was stuck with either horizontally stretched or letterboxed images. Again, really annoying. The Sony TV that replaced this one does it nicely. If there is a way to achieve this on the Samsung, please disregard (and let me know how - just curios).- Clumsy DLNA. The TV refused to play my WMA lossless tracks, or any tracks it could not decode itself, for that matter. Again, the Sony TV has no problems here - I could even stream FLAC on it. All the TV needs to do is tell the PC to do the decoding and send everything as LPCM. Simple, but the Samsung didn't do it. Noticed the same thing on DLNA-enabled Samsung BD players.But the real deal breaker was that the TV was dropping frames. Every once in a while, especially after scene transitions, the image would stutter a few times. The TV was connected directly to the cable outlet so I thought it could not decode the signal in time. I hooked it to a cable box through an HDMI cable and nothing changed. I figured the dejudder circuitry was not keeping up, but no matter how I set up the dejudder controls (Clear Motion settings, or whatever they call it), it kept doing it. Ironically, it was more visible with dejudder turned on, when the image was more fluid, beating the whole purpose. Both my wife and son noticed it so it wasn't just me.

It's been 18 months and it is still working flawlessly. I had compared this model in person side-by-side with the then-latest LG, Sony, and Sharp LEDs and Samsung earned my purchase. Samsung has the best contrast and most vivid colors of any other TV I've seen, and friends that purchased Sony LEDs agree with me. Pack this baby up with a SquareTrade 4 year warranty on Amazon and you're good to go, totally safe to anything that happens to the TV within 4 years. You can't go wrong. This TV has nearly the best image that is possible, so the only thing to worry about is reliability, and the 4 year warranty should settle any concern over that.I used this TV with my PC, connected by HDMI, and it was AWESOME for movie viewing and for gaming. Connected by HDMI you can use the MotionPlus feature, which you can't use with the dedicated VGA PC port that the TV has. Definitely go with an HDMI connection, even if it's a DVI/VGA to HDMI conversion! You won't regret it.My only gripe is that it doesn't have any Wi-Fi features where I can stream my PC's videos wirelessly. I moved a few months ago and my PC is no longer next to the TV, so I do not use my PC on it anymore. :(", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung 40 in 6300 series TV", "Author": "Thor", "ReviewID": "R2YGAAIOSGDNQC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are very pleased with this purchase.

It was a large change/upgrade for me since I had an old 26 inch cathode tv.  The sound is quite good but I will still probably run it through my speakers.  I just have regular rabbit ears for over-the-air tv and the HD channels come in just fine.  Don't believe the hype that you need a HD antenna. Mine was like 10 bucks.PROS--vibrant colors and crystal clear with the LED back-lighting.  Plenty of plug-in options on the back of the tv.  The 46 size is just right for my family room.  My friends have the 40 inch version of this tv and I found it to be a bit small.  I haven't used the internet access too much because I have a slow DSL connection.  But it did work when I tested it.  I like that I will be able to stream things through the tv when I get a faster connection.  You can adjust tv options easily.  At first it all felt too bright and clear for me:-)---now I'm used to it.CONS--I haven't really found any big issues.  Like many have said there can be a \"soap opera\" effect where people seem to be too much in 3D.  This is EASY to fix if it bothers you.  Go to the settings and change Auto Motion Plus to \"off\" or \"clear\".  The Auto Motion plus works great when you're watching sports. You have to do it again sometimes if you are watching a DVD.

THE TRUTH: The clarity is amazingly good. Great apps; however, the web browser is hopeless. The processor in tv is simply not capable enough to handle the browser. You press the down arrow to make the cursor go down - it goes down real slow and suddenly, it shoots down and you missed your target. Finally you get the vertical location and then you move the cursor left and right ten times to get the horizontal location. You also don't get a querty keyboard; which means you press each number multiple times to get a letter. Which is fine. I do it on my phone to text. But here, since the processor is soo slow, you press 2 to get \"a\" nothing happens. you press it again and you suddenly get \"b.\" it is extreamly frustrating. Lastly, even though the clarity is good, my TV cannot do pitch black screen since the greyish white light leaks through the corners and right in the middle of my screen I have another big patch of greyish white.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "LED screen blew after 6 months", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R16KI089YP1S96", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my second samsung tv and I had a great experience with my first one (it still works).

When you sit straight, the TV is awesome! HD & SD channells are superb.2. #1 is the only Pros I could find!!Cons :1. My 2 year old Panny Bluray plays videos (when connected to LAN or Wireless) non-stop, but even with LAN this TV has \"circles going on\" in the middle of the picture!!2. The screws to the stand are not \"small\" but \"Tiny\" (lol). You really need to be very careful & efficient to be able to put them together. It needed 3 of us to do it!3. Major flaw to me is if you are even 20 degree off-angle to the TV, the picture Quality suffers. Go to BESTBUY & see this SAMSUNG, SONY  & SHARP (830U model). SHarp LC52830U model is superb even at 90 degree off-angle. Sony is good too to a reasonable off-angle.4. They have something called \"Fit to Screen\" to fit SD channels which are not 1080P. When you do that, it doesn't fit the screen but fills may be 20% more! Why Samsung? Why?Overall I am disappointed with buying this TV. I bought it from Paul's Thru AMazon. If PAUL Would take it back, I would gladly return this & buy the 52\" SHARP 52LE835U (or 830U).My suggesion to buyers is \"Please go to some store and see for yourself\" and not just read reviews & features and buy.Final Remark : SAMSUNG Sux compared to my 7 year old SONY or 2 year old LED Sharp TV (700un model).Samsung UN55D6300 55-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED HDTV (Black)", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV", "Author": "Roger B.
