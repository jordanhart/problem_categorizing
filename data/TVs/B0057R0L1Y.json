I have a 26\" for the living room and a 22\" for the bedroom and both have a great picture and the audio is crystal clear. Being a 12 volt tv made me skeptical, but they draw very little power from my batteries and they out perform the 120 volt models in the house. I don't know about their service department because they both run flawlessly. As I said I am real happy with these tv's!", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV came with no bolts and does not work!", "Author": "mgauss \"mgauss\"", "ReviewID": "R2ENFHZCVN0QZL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The 6 bolts to connect the base to the body are missing.

The picture quality is very good and functionality is good too. however, the sound of both of these sets is very poor. With the volume at max, I can barely hear it, and there is a lot of distortion. On the other hand, if I feed the sound through my on-board radio, the sound is fine, so I suspect that the speakers they use are rather poor!", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$614.96", "Features": "HD Ready Yes\nVoltage - Input Range (Volts) 12\nVoltage - Input Range (Volts) 12 VDC Power\nResolution (VxH) 1366 x 768 WXGA\nWaterproof Rating NONE", "Name": "Jensen 26\" Led Tv, 12Vdc Je2612led", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YY9GiXlcL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0057R0L1Y"}}
