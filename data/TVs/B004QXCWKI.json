Beautiful and thin design with lots of cool little apps though to be honest, you'll end up using your iPhone or iPad over them. The true reason I got this TV was for its HD quality and 3D capability and boy do both shine. Whether I'm watching an HD show, Blu-ray or 3D, the colors are always vivid with no bleeding, especially of reds. Black are deep and the brights are bright but realistic bright.A lot of times, people are fooled by fake bright which might seem \"brighter\" but isn't actually real. This TV is part of a few TV's that I've seen show real colors. If you enjoy HD content, have Blu-ray movies, this is the TV for you. An extra bonus is the edition of 3D which I enjoy quite a bit, especially when gaming with the PS3.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Mathew Kabatoff", "ReviewID": "RN1SRFGO3173Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is awesome. It is like having a home cinema in your bedroom. We bought both this TV and the top range Samsung. While the Samsung has more contrast, it back lighting is quite dark, detracting from the viewing experience. The Sony however is bright and uniform; extremely high quality. The ONLY thing Sony needs to work on is their user interface. In the end there are just too many buttons and keypads required to switch between cable, AppleTV, and Video Unlimited for instance..", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony 65\" TV from Amazon", "Author": "Marvin Cotton \"Marv\"", "ReviewID": "R3B3QK8J9PRFEL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the TV on the day promised and the men who delivered took the old TV away, installed and set-up the new TV. It has been working great. I have used the TV in both 2D and 3D configurations and it was outstanding in both configurations.

The background light is not uniform on all the surface and also there are few vertical lines of shadow. I suspect to be some of the LEDs bad or not bright like the other ones. I can't return it as I live outside of US and to ship it back will cost me close to $1000. If any one has an ideea how to adjust or fix the bad LEDs, please let me know.UPDATE 12-02-2013: The TV just died today. I will try to fix it.
