{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The best you can get for under a grand", "Author": "Gooner4Ever", "ReviewID": "RFEQXI5GKQPSM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the market to upgrade from a 37\" LCD and after much deliberation, soul searching, and navel gazing I decided that the PN51D550's size and features were too good to pass up. I'm not really a 3D kinda guy but I have two young kids so the inclusion of that particular bell and whistle was non-negotiable. Considering that Amazon had it for around $950.00 including shipping, well that was just too good to pass up. Log into the account, whip out the credit card, light a novena candle to ensure safe shipping and hope for the best (and it shipped just fine.)So far I've had this machine for about a week and I must say I've been relieved and ecstatic at my decision. I'm about fifty hours into breaking in the thing (I know, I know, unnecessary perhaps but I'd much rather err on the side of caution) and it's been a love affair from the get go. Like most HDTV's, watching stuff in standard def isn't pretty but it's passable. The real beauty comes when watching stuff in HD, when everything just comes alive. Blacks are inky, reds are redder than Lenin, and the images are clean enough to eat off of. If you've ever wanted to count the lines on Gordon Ramsay's face you've come to the right TV.Because I'm still doing break in, I haven't watched any BluRays on it yet, but I'll edit my review once I get around to doing that. I also can't comment on the TV's native audio quality because I have this hooked up to a receiver, which I'd highly recommend for anyone in the market for one of these. These sets were made to be complemented by 5.1, 7.1, or 7.2 channel systems. If you are planning on doing the receiver thing, just remember that this particular model does NOT support the ARC function so you'll need an optical audio cable as well as an HDMI cable when hooking up.EDIT, 7/16: After sheepishly remembering that BluRays with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio won't show black bars I tested out a few and the results were mesmerizing. The blacks on THE DARK KNIGHT were obsidian, as they were on TRON:LEGACY but alternately the vivid whites, oranges, reds, and yellows on that film were exceptionally vivid and incandescent. I also played a few laps of GRAN TURISMO through a PS3 and it was an out of body experience. It was like the textbook definition of every color being displayed, and with no visible lag whatsoever. Astonishing. I'm coming close to the 100 hour point and I can't wait to check out 2.35:1 stuff.I don't believe in giving out calibration settings because I believe that no two TVs, and more crucially, no two TV owners are going to see the exact same thing the exact same way but I will say that once you put the PN51D550 in Movie mode about 95% of the calibration is done, at least to my peepers.Regarding issues of buzzing, I've haven't heard any emanating from my set. I keep the set's volume at zero and let my receiver handle the audio but even when I have to rely on the set's native audio (like when I play the Wii) I hear no buzzing. Either I'm one of the lucky ones or my hearing is even worse than I thought it was.Another issue I've read about the PN series revolve around brightness pops, or fluctuations, that occur, especially when watching darker scenes. I have noticed these on occasion but they tend not to bother me. You have to have a sharp eye to notice them for they usually last for a split second before the set self corrects. When watching movies famous for their dark cinematography, like THE DARK KNIGHT or BLADE RUNNER, I've noticed maybe five or six brightness pops each viewing. Not nearly enough to bother me nor to inspire a brightness pops drinking game.As for glare, yeah, it's there. You might want to consider in advance where you're going to place this baby because in the middle of a sunny day with the blinds and drapes open this thing does a killer impression of a mirror. I've found though that when I sit off to the side a bit (and this TV has an amazing viewing range, like most plasmas) the glare is much less noticeable. When you're viewing at night and don't want to sit in complete darkness, consider placing your lamps either to the side or slightly behind the set to avoid or reduce glare.All told, I can't think of another major name brand TV that brings together the best combination of size, features, and quality for under $1,000. At this (admittedly early) stage, I can honestly say that this is the best TV I've ever had the pleasure of owning.SON OF EDIT, 9/15: After two and a half months, I'm still smitten. A couple more thoughts to share:1. I cannot stress enough the importance of a break in period so all those cute little plasmites can burn evenly. I was watching the special features on the TAXI DRIVER blu ray when I stupidly fell asleep during one of the Scorcese interviews (you know you're REALLY tired if you can fall asleep to him talking.) Of course after the interview ends, the disc goes back to the main menu which has bright yellow cursive graphics all over the place. Two hours later I woke up, ejected the disc, turned off the PS3, and found some faint burn in on the blank, black screen. After smacking my forehead in self punishment, I immediately turned on an HD movie channel and let THE RING run for about five minutes. When I turned the box off to check on the screen, voila!, burn in gone. A little preparation goes a long way.2. SD content looks a bit better now, though it's obviously no match for blu rays or 720p, or those rare 1080p, broadcasts. Watching stuff on channels like Antenna TV or TV Land is a lot less messier than it was when the TV was right out of the box. If have streaming services like Netflix or Hulu+ the quality varies. Newer content, especially on Hulu+ looks and sounds outstanding, but older, grainier Netflix content looks appropriately disastrous. Well mastered DVDs played through a PS3 look terrific.I'm still insanely happy with this set. Not for nothing do I refer to it as The Third Child.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love My Samsung!", "Author": "ThisIsMyPenName", "ReviewID": "R2HXOD4B8QFPG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up the Samsung 51\" D550 from Sears on the 12th. I'd only discovered the TV online a couple hours before buying it. Always wanted a Samsung and once I saw it in the store, I was sold. Had to have it.Received a pair [2] of Samsung's new 3100 3D glasses. [Will write a separate review for those.] Beware, this TV is HUGE. I swear, it didn't look this big in the store.Picture Quality is outstanding. Break-in isn't necessary. I ran slides for a day before using the TV regularly. No IR at all. Blacks are deep and rich, Colors are rich and life-like. I haven't had it professionally calibrated, just using settings I've found on the AVS forum and tweaking them to my likes.Settings are very, very customizable. SD programs are good. Soft at times but very watchable. Of course, HD/Blu-Ray/DVD content is out of this world. Audio is surprisingly excellent. Very clear and loud. I rarely go up above 11.Also no buzzing. I heard a slight noise when I set the picture settings to Dynamic but it isn't an issue since I won't be using. [That setting is too bright and saturated for my tastes.]3D is also great. I don't really have much experience in this area since this is my first 3D TV. There was no ghosting, trailing, or halo-effect. Same for the 2D to 3D conversion. I watched Avatar converted and the actual Tron: Legacy 3D blu-ray and both films look great.For anyone who loves the \"Soap Opera\" effect, Cinema Smooth works great. I love the effect so I've left it on.Overall, it's a great TV. Very happy with the purchase it. Great plasma. Lush colors, Deep Blacks, 3D, and great SD/HD quality.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great 3D TV for the money!", "Author": "Shoe", "ReviewID": "R28YPQ69QLQ273", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing extensive research, my wife and I decided on this TV. For under $1k, it was one of the cheapest 3D plasma on the market from a reputtable company. It also has cheaper 3D glasses as well compare to others. While most 3D glasses costs around $150 per pair, it was only $50 per pair for this Samsung from Amazon or other retailers. We have watched regular 2D movies to 3D and everything is great! It even does a great job of converting regular 2D movies/shows into 3D. I could not have asked for a better TV at this price.One feature that I really love about this TV is that it has an anti-burn program which prevents burn in. I did not know that this TV had this feature until after I bought it which is big plus since I sometimes play a little video game with the PS3. Another really nice feature is that it will automatically detect when you have a 3D signal and change the screen to the 3D setting. It will also send a signal to the glasses allowing them to be turned on. In fact the feature is so great that you will not even be able to turn on the glasses until a 3D signal is available. A very good feature with the 3D glasses for this TV is that it will automatically shut off after 30 seconds of not receiving a 3D signal so you do not run the battery down. The TV will also convert 3D to 2D if you get tired of 3D viewing.My only warning is that if you will be putting the TV in a room with a lot of light, you will get a lot of glare due to the glass screen. For a brighter room, you may/will want to go with an LCD. If you are planning for using it in a dark room, this TV will knock your socks off. The colors are some much more vibrant compare to an LCD with the same signal and resolution. I have an LG LCD 1080P which has a great picture but this plasma blows it away with how rich and vibrant the colors are.Things to remember if you are planning on watching 3D Blu-Ray movies with this TV:-3D capable Blu-Ray player like a PS3-HDMI cable (go with the best you can afford that can send 3D signals/data)-3D glasses (you will need one pair per person)", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Close enough to perfect for me.", "Author": "James E. Butler", "ReviewID": "R1ZF4DQQY7DKV3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My last TV was a 56\" Panasonic LCD RP . Good set, but wanted to try 3D and a highly regarded plasma. The only thing negative about this set is glare can be a problem. I realised this could be the case and took a chance. Is it intolerable? Not really. I just thought it might not be very noticeable. The picture otherwise is so darn incredible I will learn to live with it and frankly am starting to get use to it, which means obviously it's not that bad. There is a adjustment period coming from a bright flashy LCD to a plasma. At first you might not appreciate the quality of the picture this set produces. There is also a significant improvement in the picture with break in. Would I exchange it for a quality LCD now that I have had some time with it? You would have to pry the remote out of my cold dead hands. 3D performance is incredible. Glasses can be bought from Amazon.com for less than $50.00 a pair and are light weight and reasonably comfortable. The range of these Blue tooth glasses is over 25' in my environment and ghosting so far has been a no show.  The 2D-3D up conversion is pretty darn good most of the time and is definitely not a gimmick. The buying experience with Amazon and Electronics Expo was outstanding.

Acceptable in my bright two story living room and west facing wall.Bought a mid-grade LED for $2,100. Sure the picture had more \"pop\" but even after making all the adjustments; athletes running (esp baseball players running in the outfield) had a haze around them, even a little off center viewing turned blacks into grays, had to turn off the 240Mhz due to jutter, did not include 3D glasses, etc. All unacceptable for a TV over $2k. This mid grade plasma was $1,600 at Best Buy and included 2 pairs of glasses and blows away the equivalent grade LED. You will not be disappointed.  Awesome for sports.

Hands down, best TV that I have seen at any home (media room) and it's all mine!  Yes, I'm sure that you could spend twice as much and get the Samsung 8000 series and be more impressed, but unless you are a pro, you'll never notice the difference without the 2 TV's side by side.I brought it home and hooked it up to HDMI feed through my PS3, and started to put on different material to test it out.  Tried \"Dark Knight\", and \"UP\" and the colors on this thing are outstanding.  Blacks are extremely good as well.  I was always so used to my LCD's that I didn't really know how good plasma's blacks can get.  I do have a dedicated media room though with blacked out windows, so take that into consideration.  Also I played a little Uncharted 2 for the PS3, and almost brought a tear to my eye......This thing is the best TV that I have ever owned.  I have owned 2 DLP's, a few LCD's, and some of the old Sony Bravia CRT's.  All of which I paid almost double what this TV cost me.  Funny how electronics seem to get cheaper and better each year?The only thing that buyers should be aware of is that this has a pretty reflective screen.  This could be a problem in a bright room, but since I have a dark room, I prefer the glossy glass.I was able to tweak the settings a little bit, and it only gets better.  I have not experienced anything that others have mentioned about \"floating blacks\", pixelation, or contrast and brightness pops.  I have only had it for a day though.  I am currently breaking in the set with the color palettes from AVS forum, and will then do an AVIA calibration.  I have noticed that on the color palettes that show up, that my screen is completely uniform (no bright, dark, or odd colors), which is something that I cannot say for both of my LCD's.  I may do an update to this opinion/review later, but right now, I could almost just leave it on Standard out of the box and be pleased.I was considering both the Panasonic 55ST30 and the LG 60PZ550, and after deliberating and researching for over 2 weeks, I went with the Samsung.  I was not able to compare the Panasonic ST30 and this TV side by side, but when I was able to find it in store, it seemed that the Panny was not as colorful, or as sharp as this one.  I always turn the sets to Cinema to compare as the settings are horrible when using Dynamic, or Vivid settings.  Panasonic past plasmas and in-store reps kept pushing me towards the Panasonic, but I just couldn't convince myself that it was better than the Samsung D550.  Maybe if the Panasonic were the same size, and came with glasses then it would have been a tougher decision, but happy I went with the Samsung.  The LG just seemed inferior to the other 2 every time I looked.  I was trying to convince myself to go with LG because it was cheaper, larger, came with 2 glasses, and I think internet apps, but the picture quality just wasn't there for me.  I think it had a better Anti-Reflective screen than the Samsung, but that was about it.  Colors didn't POP, and when watching some HD content, noticed that blacks and other dark scenes were grainy.  The Samsung came with 2 free glasses, and although I think 3D is kinda cheesy, why not get $300 worth of glasses that you can use if you want.All together, I think the Samsung PN59D550 was a great purchase.  Great color POP, good blacks, really good in a dark room, and so far no issues.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Blows Me Away Again!! Best Panels Hands Down!", "Author": "bigabez", "ReviewID": "R24YMHAF6BK3AM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited a few weeks to write this review until I had a chance to really sit and enjoy it for a while. I absolutely love this TV!! This is the 2nd Samsung TV I have bought off Amazon and I would most certainly buy another 1! I upgraded to the 3D TV from a Samsung LN46A650 LCD which I loved but I was itching to get on the 3D scene not only because of the movies, but also all of the new 3D games that are coming out. Let me just say I have not been disappointed one bit! This plasma was very rich and has deep colors! It's much more saturated then my LCD, and you can tell the black levels are much fuller. I know this is the base model but after much research I found this to be the best panel for dollar! I have tweaked it to my liking and calibrated it for my viewing area. I was very impressed with how clear the picture has been since getting it tuned in. I tend to play a lot of video games and watch a lot of movies, so I've had my eye on it for quite some time just waiting to pull the trigger. I would honestly say if it has any downfalls it's clearly the screen glare. I noticed it right away having it set up facing in from my 2 large windows, still the lights hanging behind, on the walls, and the window in the back were leaving a bad reflection. Needless to say I was at home depot the very next day getting the supplies needed to put up new black out curtains, and shades! After a few hours of hanging new shades I can honestly say this was worth every cent! I have a few friends who have DLP TV's and I think the 3D is hands down better on this Plasma. I haven't been able to compare it to a LED LCD, but in my opinion the 3D games look crisp and deep, not to disappoint. The Samsung 3D active glasses synced up seamlessly, and I now own 7 pairs of the 3100's (thanks to the price drop and amazon, yes!) I had a party for the 4th of July and we watched Tangled 3D all the kids kept trying to go up and touch the screen as it looked like everything was really coming right at you. Its easily the best 3D movie I have seen so far. I also have to mention the shipping went flawless as well. I had heard a lot of horror stories about certain trucking companies but both of my TV's were delivered on schedule with tracking information and courtesy call on time to set up my appointments. Both were nailed right on time and both my TV's worked with no problems. I guess I consider myself lucky, but I feel that is worth mentioning as well. The TV is large and I have a 8-10 feet viewing area, it's big but not to big so don't be afraid to go with this TV if you live in a small apartment or town house. It was a little awkward trying to get it out of the box, it's not heavy but its so long it takes 2 people to take it out without fear of damaging it. There is also a stand assembly that requires 2 people, it didn't take long, but again you will need help if you don't want to risk dropping it while getting it on (if you don't plan on mounting it on the wall).  I was a bit scared to buy a plasma because of all the \"burn in\" and \"ghosting\" imaging you hear about, but I have been using the playstation visualizer to break it in and get it about 150+ hours of viewing, and I have had no problems with it. I'm being a little cautions as there is still warnings in the manual not to exceed 5% of viewing time per week on static images (logo bugs, scrolling scores, video game life meters, etc) so I've been mindful of those, it's also recommended you not let it exceed 20 min at a time with black bars, etc, which I haven't had a problem with playing everything full screen. So far no problems another reason I waited to write this review, it does have some built in features such as pixel shifting and auto scrolling to help you which are nice.

Bought this plasma because we got more features for the money than with the same size LED/LCD's.  Paid $999 plus Samsung Blu-Ray for $150 at BB.

It's almost dimensional (and I'm not using it in the 3D feature since I don't really care about that.  When shopping I discovered I'm sensitive to black levels and this TV is super sharp and contrast is wonderful.

Granted, I was warned about this but I thought I'd get used to it since our old CRT TV had a glass screen, but it annoys me to see myself sitting on the couch during a show that happens to have some darkness on the screen - think night scenes or dramas. Doesn't bother anyone except me.  If you could lessen the brightness in the room with curtains it wouldn't be a problem.  I have a skylight so I can't do anything, but I placed the TV where no windows were opposite of it.2)  Mirror-like effect is annoying if lamps are in line with the TV so you'll have to move them or watch TV in complete darkness.  The picture really is best in complete darkness with the Blu-Ray or HD content.  But not everyone in our family likes watching TV in complete darkness so I'm just mentioning.3)  This TV doesn't look great without HD programming.  When we first bought it I almost returned it because we just had standard DirecTV.  But, once we upgraded to HD programming -which meant more $ each month, a new satellite dish installation ($40), and a new HD DirecTV receiver - it has been excellent.  Our local channels only broadcast HD content at night and I tried with my rooftop antennae just to see and noticed when HD was on and not.4)  I bought a Samsung Blu Ray player to turn the TV into a \"Smart TV\" thinking I was saving $ but you have to pay for the good apps that the salespeople were selling at the store.

We brought it home and the TV was too dark.  No matter how we set the picture, the only way we could watch the TV was with the lights off. And even then, the TV picture was dark.  Unhappy with the quality, we packed up the TV and brought it back and went back to our research.  We really liked the picture quality on the Samsung, but the LED/LCD were too expensive. And then this model came up on Amazon.It was back ordered and took over 3 weeks to get. But the wait was worth it. The picture is pronominal in both bright and dark light.  The color is crisp and clear.  Everything looks vibrant and beautiful.  And the best part: it is 4\" bigger than other TVs for the same price.I am extremely happy with the TV and would purchase a Samsung TV again.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW.

Very distracting, even with the surround sound at a moderate level.  Every quiet moment in a movie is now ruined with the hum.

So lets start things off first with the brightness pops we have been reading about. When i first plugged the tv in for the first time and begun to watch both standard and high def content I immediately noticed that every once in a while I would get the \"Brightness POP\". I wanted to first deal with it for the first week and then calibrate the TV and see what the experience was then. I calibrated the set (DVE) and watched more standard and high def channels and to my surprise the \"pops\" were significantly less noticeable. Yes it is still happening but so far not enough to make me want to return my set. Secondly i upgraded the firmware to the latest version (Aug 2011 update) but in my opinion that has not made any difference.All i have to say about picture quality is WOW! This is by far the best plasma in my collection. I have a Pannasonic 50ST30 which i will admit has better blacks and more internet features BUT the colors on the Samsung in my opinion are far superior. I do notice that there is more artifacting on extreme moving content on the Samsung than on the Panny BUT I only notice it at 5 feet away from the set. Once i am sitting at normal distance 10 feet i do not notice the artifacting at all. The screen reflection is significantly greater on the Samsung but i have a controlled environment so it is not an issue for me.Here is best part of D550. There is a way to 10pt calibrate which puts this tv on par with the D7000-D8000 series. Read up on it. Its true and it works and it DOES look better than the Panny.<Conclusion>I can deal with the \"pops\" and let me tell you why. When i am watching or playing TV all i want to do is watch the content that i am watching. Sure i can sit here and look for every issue this TV has but i don't. I'm immersed in what i am watching. That being said i do not notice the \"pops\". Additionally now because i have unlocked it full potential (10pt calibration) i can really say to my self i have a D7000-8000 not a d550. Minus the screen filter.lol. I love it and Ive learned to deal with the tiny issues and will not be returning this set.<<<Update 11/9/2011>>>Another thing i noticed is if the gamma is -1 the brightness pops are more obvious.

Johnston \"I <3 Zombies\"", "ReviewID": "R1IFH2QR5D9FJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying, I don't always review products I have purchased, but when I do, they have usually blown my mind. The PN59D550 is no exception, Mind = Blown.  I bought this TV November 19, 2011 and I've had ample time to get a feel for the set.  This is my review.I spent months on the internet doing research on Plasma vs LCD/LED and decided on Plasma for my needs (moderate gaming, lots of movie watching). I was lucky to catch this unit on sale with a two free pairs of 3D glasses and I couldn't be any happier.Once I unloaded the set and opened the box, I was quite astounded by the sheer size of this 59\" set. Seeing it set up in store is one thing, but looking at this beast on the floor of my rec-room I couldn't wait to get her up and running. The aesthetics of this particular model are top notch. The bezel is sleek and modern looking and very pleasing to the eye. The set itself is very slim for a plasma set. Now to address some internet inaccuracies, some sites claim less than 4 HDMI ports on this model, but there are actually 4 HDMI ports on the back; however, two are on the \"side\" of the unit... not more than an inch from the \"back\" ports. So, to recap, there are actually FOUR (4) HDMI ports. Don't let the internet fool you on this.It took no time at all for me to get the set mounted on my TV stand and hooked up to my Uverse Box, Xbox 360, and Sony 3D BluRay player (BDP-S570). The picture quality straight out of the box was amazing to say the least when hooked up to my Uverse HD box. As awesome as the picture was straight away, I decided to dial the contrast down to below 50 for the first 150 hours. Now, if you do research on the internet, there are two schools of thought with regards to the need to run 100 - 200 hours of a break in period in order to age the phosphors evenly, and whether or not the new plasma sets are susceptible to Image Retention and Burn In. Some say that the new sets don't suffer from IR/Burn In at all, while there are many forum users who swear they have already noticed IR/Burn In due to static images being displayed for too long. I decided to err on the side of caution and only run full screen HD movies on BluRay, HBO, or any source that doesn't have a static image anywhere on the screen (no logos, or black bars on the top/side). At night and while I wasn't home, I found that \"break in slides\" which are just 20 slides of different shades of White, Red, Blue, and Green running in a loop from a USB drive, helped me to get through the first 150 break in hours.Once the first 150 hours were behind me, I searched online for optimal picture settings and adjusted my set accordingly. All I can say is WOW. I'm constantly blown away by the OUTSTANDING picture quality, depth of color, and the way the TV handles fast action with sports (no motion blur whatsoever). The images really do pop off the screen, and I continually can't wait to watch more bluray movies on this TV. The 3D wasn't really a feature I had to have, but I'm glad I decided to go with it. This set displays true 3D content flawlessly and I'm constantly amazed at the 3D images. The set can also convert regular 2D images to 3D. We found this feature to be surprisingly good. The wife broke it in with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Pt 1 and she thought she was actually watching the real 3D content, not just the 2D conversion to 3D.Now to address a few of the \"issues\" that I've read about in doing my research; the sound, glare, heat, buzzing, and fluctuating brightness (brightness pops).Sound:  To start with, the Sound is just fine unless you are some sort of audiophile. I would give it a 4.5 if I were rating that in it's own category. To be honest though, if you are buying a TV of this size and quality, you are going to upgrade to surround sound to get the greatest home theater experience. Just don't expect the sound from this set to blow your socks off right out of the box.Glare:  The Glare on this set is definitely noticeable, but again, if you've done your research you'll know that many of the plasma sets in this price range are going to have the glass screen with no anti-glare filter, so you can expect to see a little glare from windows or lamps that are in front of the TV. In my case, I have a very light controlled room that this TV resides in, so the glare is negligible. If your room is light controlled, then the glare won't be an issue for you either.Heat:  The amount of Heat the set puts off is only noticeable if you are standing 2' or closer to the screen, so it's not like a \"space heater\" that I've seen some reviewers compare it to. I'd mark this down as a \"non-issue\" as well.Buzzing:  The Buzzing/Humming had me a little concerned at first, but I have pretty sensitive ears. When the TV is on with no volume on, you can definitely hear a buzzing/humming sound coming from about 2/3 of the way up on the screen. I don't know if I would consider it a buzzing sound as much as I'd consider it a high pitched frequency sound, almost like one of those iPhone or Android apps that you can change the level of the buzzing sound.  It's my understanding that all plasma TV's have issues with buzzing one way or another, some louder than others. While sitting directly in front of the set, approximately 12 - 13' away, I can hear it only slightly if I'm REALLY listening for it.  It almost seems that the buzzing is only in a certain 'zone', as if you keep your head at the same level and move around the room, it's like you walk into the buzzing then walk right out of it.  When the TV is on at moderate volume (volume value 10 - 12 or higher on the set) the buzzing sound isn't noticeable at all. The buzzing is something that will depend on the user and their hearing sensitivity. I never mentioned the buzzing to my wife just to see if she noticed it on her own, and she has yet to bring it up. Your results may vary with this \"issue\".Fluctuating Brightness:  Lastly, I have noticed the Brightness Pops/Fluctuating Brightness that people talk about on the message boards and in reviews, but they were so slight that I had to REALLY watch for them. They were mostly noticeable in the first 50 hours of viewing. I'm not sure if it has something to do with the picture settings I've used, but I haven't noticed any of the brightness pops lately.All in all, after weighing the amazing picture and overall look of this TV against the \"issues\" mentioned, I'd say that I am 100% completely satisfied with my purchase and I don't think I could ever turn back from plasma and their outstanding picture quality. Hopefully this review will help you make the right decision on your new TV purchase!

I knew I wanted the Panasonic plasma or Samsung.  Each has a couple models to choose from in our price range so we looked and looked and compared the two brands.  Panasonic was good but to get less glare and deeper blacks you have to go to their higher price models with the special screen.  The Samsung PN51D550 is a step above and worth the $100 difference compared to the lesser Samsung model in not only features but picture quality.  Yes, there are things you must read about and make adjustments but it's worth the little time it takes to learn how and why adjustments are to be made.  Sound is fairly good for a big screen but glare is not the big problem that we were made to fear.  And you can make adjustments to both so it meets your room needs and your personal preferences.

Being a new owner I have overcome all agony and am just enjoying Samsung 64 Heaven. Is Samsung better than Panny? Dont care. I luv my Sammy.Calibration after exhausting internet searches has become the realization that one recipe does not serve all enviroments. I first used the basic codes genrally from the Internet. I have tweak those codes as I like it brighter. Also luving the many Formats available for screen image. I am seeking no Black borders at the sides, top, and bottom. I built a wood stand for the top of the credenza. Wanted the Directv receiver to the right of the glass stand. Sam 64 550 is the same engine as the 8000/7000/6500 unit. Was considering LED 3D and am so glad went with Plasma. The Sam64/550 has Plus1sides, its light at 80pounds and will soon be wall mounted. Purchased from Amazon, Pauls TV and shipped by Pilot Freight. They brought into my room of choice, opened the box, setup the Remote, powered the unit in its box and walked out the door. Bottom line this is a great 3D Plasma. The 64 inch size works in my Condo Unit. The TV and its frame is stunning. Am so glad its in my home. HOME THEATER is using a brand new Pioneer VSX1121 AV with its Seven (7) HDMI ports. Reduced Cables and the rats nest. As the Plasma Matures with time used, am looking forward to the stunning picture to continue to please customer satisfaction. Thank you Samsung. Go to [...]. Set cell light and contrast reduced settings till 300 hours of use. Once done never worry about image retention. Wall rack is Cheetah 165# rated. Used 1/4 X 3 toggle bolts with not a worry.

Movies with black bands at the top,bottom, or sides no issue. The phos has matured. Thepicture is true, versus the LED/LCD harsh yowie. The HDisbest described as lifelike. I am asports fan and baskeball or football is just extreme joy. Purchased Samy not Pany becuse of CNET review. The Pany 65 was much cheaper, so glad I purchased Samy 64.Now one and half year laterSammy made one great TV. Seldom is there no regrets 22 months after anything is purchased. I luv this TV.

Henry", "ReviewID": "R1EZ1FRK7CBP99", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsung PN64D550 to replace my old late-2006 vintage Samsung plasma HDTV (which is still going strong). When I set out to buy a bigger TV, I had a few requirements:1) I wanted another plasma set.  LCD may have made great strides in the last few years, but at the end of the day, I still prefer plasma, and think plasma has the superior picture quality.  Yes, plasma sets can have glare.  Make sure you have the appropriate lighting if you're going to purchase a plasma HDTV.  Also, I stare at 4 LCD monitors all day at work.  After 10 hours of that, I'd prefer to not sit in front of yet another LCD screen to watch TV.  Plasma rocks!2) I wanted a Samsung.  Yes, this limited my choices, but I saw that as a good thing, and a bad thing.  Mainly, I didn't have as many TVs to pick from.  My old Samsung has been rock solid, and a consistently great picture quality.  I know two others with Samsung plasma sets that have had similar good experiences, so this is one time I felt like brand loyalty might be easier than doing hours and hours of research.3) I wanted the biggest TV I could afford.  Coming from a 50\" HDTV, I wanted to go at least 10\" bigger.  The Samsung PN64D550 was right in my sweet spot, as far as budget, and a great size, too.  In fact, I ended up paying less for this TV than I did for me 50\" Samsung back in 2006.  Ahh, the wonders of tech pricing!So, I finally decided to pull the trigger on this purchase.  Amazon's delivery was flawless, just like my original Samsung unit back in 2006.  Their delivery company called me, set up a delivery time, and arrived within their scheduled time.  The TV itself was in perfect condition with no damage during shipping.Setting up the Samsung PN64D550 was a breeze (albeit, somewhat heavy since I was doing it by myself).  The ports are all well labeled, and laid out in a practical manner. Diving into the setup menus on the TV was very familiar - just an updated look and feel to the interface on my old Samsung.  Again, everything in the menu is well laid out, and easy to use.  The menu itself is responsive, and quite slick.This TV is big.  Considerably larger than the 50\" it replaced.  That's not a bad thing, but it is surprisingly large once you get it set up.  Of course, to be fair, I said the same thing about the 50\" when I first got it.  I guess these things have a way of growing on you.Anyway, the picture quality is great, and certainly met my expectations.  I still need to run my calibration Blu-ray and really get this thing calibrated properly, but for now, I've at least got some more common-sense settings and moved away from the factory retina-scorching defaults.  The picture has a good dynamic contrast, and there are no artifacts present to my eye.  I can say the picture quality easily exceed that of my older 50\" 1080p Samsung.I suspect that most people buying a TV of this size won't be using the internal speaker, but I did have to use it for a few days while my receiver was being RMA'd.  For such a tiny speaker, it worked surprisingly well.  It was able to get acceptably loud, and provided enough volume to satisfy anyone seated in my living room.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase.  Yes, there may be better plasma sets out there, but for the money, I think Samsung has a winner here.  Hopefully my past experience with Samsung holds true.

I didnt purchase the TV for the 3D option, but since this was the \"entry model\" for this size, a TV this size could not be purchased with out it. Anyways, the 3D is wicked cool...especially if you have kids (not too small though, as the glasses are too expensive for toddlers to be playin with).Inputs, inputs, inputs...a lot of TVs dont have all inputs or enough of the inputs you want.

I was worried about buying something like this online.  I had reason to worry.  I guess my package was one of the ones everyone has been watching clips of on the Internet.  It arrived and every piece of styrofoam packing was disintegrated into particles and the face of the TV was up against cardboard.  The face was shattered.  But, Paul's TV processed my return without a hitch so kudos to them.  I got my refund and paid a little more for the TV at our local Fry's.  Big TV's just aren't something you should buy online.  Too dang fragile for handling by your typical delivery grunt.The TV...  That's great.  Some comments have called out \"Brightness pops\" or excessive noise from cooling fans but I see none that in this model.  It's clear, brightness is even and it seems quiet as any normal TV.  The AllShare feature is killer.  I have the TV networked up and it gets a feed from my PC running TVMobili (but there are many options for serving up media) and it's great.  Movies, music and pictures all on the TV for easy browsing.  Doesn't have onboard apps for direct Netflix access but that wasn't something I wanted since I hook up my iPad to the RV for that sort of feed.Yeah, it's plasma and yes, you should be careful about burn in on such TVs but they are cheaper in general and burn in is much less of a risk with contemporary systems.  This TV (and I assume most new plasma TVs) have pixel shifting technology to help guard against that but I try to guard against other dangers such as side bars on screen too long on 4:3 programs and keeping ticker type bars from being only constantly.

Ultimately, the decision maker for me was spending half-an-hour in the local Frys, comparing the two displays.  I found that the Samsung was much smoother during fast action.  Other than that, I found them to be virtually identical.  So, from my perspective, the Samsung was actually better and cheaper, and only 1\" smaller.I got the TV last night and set it up, with some basic calibration.  It's hard to describe how much presence this TV has - it completely dominates the room (which is what I wanted).  It is bright and beautiful and the colors are great.  Only a whisper of a buzz, unnoticeable more than a foot from the TV.I have not detected any of the fluctuating brightness issues.  But I did some research on that - if I understand the forums correctly, setting the 'cell light' to 20 helps eliminate the fluctuating brightness (which I have done).  That makes the TV very, very bright.  When watching Blu Rays, I find it best to drop the Cell Light down a bit, but it's not a big deal.As far as the colors - I am not an artist.  I cannot easily distinguish and name different  shades of red, or blue.  I can't differentiate between 90% black and 89% black.  And I suspect that most of you out there can't either.  So paying more for the 'better blacks' of the D7000 or D8000 seems like a complete waste.So for a normal person, this TV is epic.  The only issue I've found with it is more reflectivity than I had hoped.  I knew that it would have more reflection than an LCD, of course, but I was hoping it would be less noticeable.  But that's not an issue at night.  And that one issue isn't enough to lose even half of a star - I'd give it a 4.75 if I could.

I got the Samsung in time to watch the Dallas Mavs win the 2011-12 NBA Championship, and it was a joy to watch on the new TV.

It isn't longer than any other model or brand of TV that I have checked out, but it seems that near instant channel changing should be normal by now. I assume it is a processing power problem (so much digital data to convert to video), but I don't really know.We don't make tough, film buff demands on our TV, but I do tend to notice video or audio problems and I have no complaints at all about the PN51D550 picture and the sound is fine. We do not have our sound going through a receiver; we just use the regular TV audio setup.SEVER REFLECTIONS 1In our setup, the reflections from the screen are a severe distraction because our couch has a window behind it. In the months since we got the plasma TV I have continually intended to put up some kind of blackout screen or window treatment over the window, but I haven't done it yet. Sometimes my children will put a sheet up over the window which helps blur the hard edges of the window blinds and makes the reflection less distracting. We sometimes do not bother angling the screen and just ignore the reflection, but during daylight hours we will regularly angle the screen to avoid having the window reflection directly in the middle of the screen. Luckily, the wide viewing angle helps a lot in that case. Still, ANY lighted object will show up as a minor or major distraction on the picture--day or night. Again, for us this is not a deal breaker and I knew about it before I bought the TV--just be prepared.SEVERE REFLECTIONS 2I just thought of what might be an apt comparison: the reflections in the plasma TV are similar to the reflections in our car's rear view mirror when it is set on \"night\" but MUCH bigger and so very distracting. When the TV is on the reflections are less noticeable--unless there is a bright window like the one behind our couch. When the TV is off it is like having a giant \"darkened\" mirror in our den.NO PARTIAL CHANNEL SEARCHNo partial channel search (our Vizio had it), so when the cable company switched a few frequencies I had to re-scan ALL frequencies and then laboriously delete unused channels all over again.NICE SWIVEL BASEI was skittish about touching the TV because it seems that it must be top-heavy and easy to tilt and crash, and the equipment that attached the TV to the base isn't titanium or something that makes me think it won't break someday. However, my fears have subsided to almost nothing. We swivel the TV all the time to avoid reflections or just to have more people watch from around the room. (A more likely TV crash will be caused by my kids kicking a soccer ball in the house.)AUDIOWe should get a receiver and upgrade our sound, but I gave the audio four (4) stars because it seems pretty good for internal TV audio.3-D NOT VERY USEFUL FOR US RIGHT NOW3-D looks good, it is enjoyable, and I would use it more often, but the movies are expensive to buy and we haven't upgraded our (now) one-disk-at-a-time Netflix subscription to Blu-ray. The 3-D glasses are the more expensive \"active\" kind, but I got the Internet price match at \"fries\" and so the price was only bad and not terrible (about $30 each as I recall). I am not sure 3-D will catch on enough to warrant the extra expense, but I felt it was a fair insurance price versus the other TVs available without 3-D.BOTTOM LINEI love the TV and would buy it again. The equivalent LCD/LED equivalent from Samsung would be a great alternative at a higher cost, but the price point was an important consideration for us. Once we put up a window treatment to (nearly) end the reflection problem, the plasma's much wider viewing angle will, for us, be worth the warm screen and extra electricity cost.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Tv", "Author": "Benjamin D.

Electronics are some very difficult products to give an accurate review. I am doing this review because I really understand everything about this TV. I have own this television for over 8 months. The pros outweigh the cons and overall it is a great television. I have had a fear of plasma burn; thus, preventing me in the past from buying a plasma television.  A few time I had forgot to turn the television off, and the image looked like burned into the screen.  I felt that my fears were going to be realized; however, I was completely wrong about screen burn.  First the television has an anti burn prevention measure and it works very well. Two things I learned about plasmas, one use the burn prevention and two find a channel that has the fuzzy black and white on the screen. These two measures reset the picture and in the long run prevent screen burn. This is where I feel that I made the right decision in buying this product. I have read a few reviews that talk about a buzzing noise, I have not heard anything this far. Another thing that people forget about plasmas is they consume energy and the television will get warm but not hot.  The screen resolution in the television is superb. The black and white value far surpasses an LED.  I enjoying watching black and white movies and the definition in the mono tone colors make watching older movies more enjoyable. The one thing that is evident is how some shows and movies are shot; furthermore, the television does a great job in showing the differences between the resolutions.  A true HD movie comes off the screen and into the room with vibrant life.  Lower quality HD movies are noticeable as well. Watching sports in HD is awesome.  I have not used the 3D component of the television; therefore, I cannot speculate how that functions.

At the lower refresh rates, music based video games oftentimes get very jagged and can mess up in continuity. But with this plasma TV @ 600Hz, the picture is very smooth and crisp as well as sharp.Plasma TVs have gotten a very bad reputation over the past 5 years, mostly due to high energy usage and burn-in problems. Consumers have never given them a second chance, but the problems have since been fixed. Mostly... I have noticed that the PN51D550 does run a little hot, but that is of no concern due to good ventilation.The bigger the TV you want, the larger the price tag gets. LCD and LED-LCD TVs exponentially increase to astronomical prices once you reach the 55\"+ point. Plasma TVs are the way to go if you want a decent price and a HUGE picture.Sound wise, I am not overly impressed, but I now have a surround sound system to compensate.

It arrived about a week or so later and everything was going fine....until November.  First, the picture went out.  So I called Samsung, who promised to send a tech out since it was still under warranty.  The tech asked if there was a crack in the screen, and after closely inspecting, I told her there was not.  The next day the TV would not come on at all.  All it would do was pop or flash a red light like it was trying to, but nada, so I unplugged it and waited.  It took two days for the tech to call and another two days for him to come to my house.  The day before the tech arrived I saw a crack in the screen.  Close to the middle, about a half and inch and ON THE INSIDE!  I KNOW this was not there when I first called and reported the problem and happened while I was waiting on the tech guy.  So after the tech guy came out and took a few pictures and left, I had to call Samsung to finally get their response.  They claimed I had damaged my TV and that voided my warranty and they were not going to fix the TV.  Really?!  How did I manage to internally crack a TV that was unplugged???  So after some pleading and deliberation, they agreed to replace the panel, but I had to pay labor, which I agreed.  I got a call from the same tech people saying that my part would be like $450 bucks (WHAT?!!), which included labor and \"service fees\".  I did not want to pour this money into the TV and then find out that a capacitor had blown (no picture) too, so I called Samsung yet again and they said no, there was nothing more that they could do.  I tried everything with those people.  I asked if they would ship the panel to me to fix:  NO.  I asked if I could return my TV to them for a refurb and send me a voucher toward another:  NO.

Setting it to 60 Hertz will ensure your plasma display will get the refresh rate input it is expecting.2. Plasma Display > Remote Control - Source > Remote Control - Tools > Display Menu - Edit Name >Select anything that doesn't have the letters 'PC' in it.Doing this disables 'PC Mode' for the source input. I know it sounds counter intuitive but if you want 60 Hertz with out getting blurry text, do this.3. Plasma Display > Remote Control - Menu > Display Menu - Picture > Display Menu - Screen Adjustment > Display Menu - Picture Size >Select 'Screen Fit'With 'PC Mode' disabled to handle the blurry text problem, '16:9' causes the content to overfill the plasma display.

The tv also has image wipe feature which I have not even needed ........I saw a few reviews on here and the tv does have a power button (Samsung just moved the buttons from right side to lower left bottom lol) also IMO the tv has very good sound for a thin plasma tv when put on \"movie\" sound mode. I purchased the Samsung D430 or 530 I forget the exact model 59\" from Walmart for $999.00 SuperBowl special  and took it back 2 days later because no VGA inputs, the sound was terrible and black bleeding was also bad.This 64\" Samsung has the best picture I have ever seen....the only **negative about the tv is it does put out a noticable amout of heat radiating from about 8 inches from the tv that my Samsung 50\" plasma never had this problem. I assume this is related to being thinner or the larger screen.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Tv", "Author": "Javier", "ReviewID": "R1CU466E3947MY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello, I bought the Samsung PN51D550 from Vanns.com through Amazon.com.

I consider myself a picky electronics customer , proven by the fact that I purchased two other HDTV's within a two week period prior to getting this one. I had purchased the Panasonic 60\" GT30 Plasma , I was pretty satisfied with the quality of picture on the Pani , but I felt that it Buzzed too loud and gave off an inordinate amount of heat , you could feel the heat about four or five feet away , as far as the buzzing it was particularly loud while changing channels. The main reason I returned it to the local retailer I had purchased it from was because I saw the same TV on Amazon for about 220.00 dollars less than I paid and considering No Tax ( About 130.00) and free delivery , I felt it was a no brainer. However when I returned the TV , I went inside the store and they had the Samsung 8000 LED with two glasses for 1800.00 , this particular TV was going for about 2200.00 online and since it had the capability to display film in the infamous \" Soap Opera \" effect ( Which I kinda like ) , I went with this TV. However when I got home and hooked it up , I was not thrilled , the images (Mostly watching Sports) on LED/LCD suffer from inaccurate representation in the moving image , to me, compared to plasma it often looks like what Standard Def. looks on a HDTV.I have a Pani Plasma in the Master BR, I compared the image from a soccer match by going from the LED to the Plasma and could easily see the difference ( While watching football on instant replays the feet and legs of the players looked like a cartoon , like when the feet are trying to move but they don't make any forward progress) , another thing I did not like was the viewing angle on the LED , it just does not compare to the Plasma, the quality of the image would lose it's POP and the picture would be significantly duller.So I returned the LED and went in the store again , I had read the reviews on the 64\" Samsung Plasma and felt it was worth a try. However this particular store had the TV for 1900.00 and online it was available for about 1675.00, plus the local retailer would not match, so I had to buy it online. I tracked the delivery through the carriers (Pilot) tracking system online and when it made it to Miami , I went to pick it up myself instead of having them deliver to my house ( I have heard some horror stories.....), I inspected the TV before signing and \"sped\" home after it passed the quick inspection. Got home, mounted the Beast and was completely impressed from the beginning. I have DirecTV with HDMI connections and a Samsung Blue Ray player , plus I have an OnKyo Surround Sound sys. The TV has an internet connection and my stepson can see YouTube Videos streamed from his SmartPhone (Samsung) and my wife can as well (IPhone), I have an External HD connected that has movies and the TV recognized the different formats right way and played most of the movies  W/O any issues , it did not play a couple of the movies , but I do not really know why , maybe these particular files (Movies) had a slightly different file format that the TV did not recognize. I have not tried the All Share which is basically, DLNA , here is a link on setting it up : [...]. The TV buzzes, but not to the point that it bothers anybody in the house and it does get warm , not hot, also nothing to diminish your overall satisfaction. The TV can also do a milder version of the \"Soap Opera\" effect through the Blue Ray player and adjusting the settings to Cinema Smooth in the picture options. Your blue ray player must be able to transmit 1080P @ 24HZ and your movies will display in a milder than LED version of the soap opera effect. DirectTV on some of their Pay-Per-View can also transmit @ 1080P @ 24HZ.Finally the 3D is pretty nice , DirecTV has 3 free 3d channels and I beleive one PPV 3D channel.My stepson likes the 2D to 3D better than the actual 3D content , the glasses are inexpensive (Like 25.00) and light. In conclusion, the entire family loves the TV and take it  from a picky guy, sports look unbelievable, movies looks awesome and in general I highly recommend this beautiful TV.

The picture and 3D on this model is great. The TV is enormous, which is exactly what I wanted. I would've given it 5 stars if it weren't for the 2 following issues:1) This model does not have the checkerboard and interlaced 3D modes. It only has side-by-side, top/bottom and 2d to 3d conversion. The Samsung I purchased last year has 7 different 3D options, this one only has 3 options. The checkerboard worked great when watching through my computer, but the side-by-side on this tv looks great as well so it's not that big an issue as the next problem.2) The active 3D glasses on my other Samsung do not work with this model. This is a huge disappointment and a major inconvenience. I purchased 2 pairs of glasses for my lcd Samsung last year and they weren't cheap. You can't really have a few friends over to watch a 3d movie with only 2 pairs of glasses so I figured I would buy 2 more so 4 people could watch but for whatever reason Samsung decided not to make the glasses compatible so that problem isn't solved.Aside from those 2 issues, this tv is great, especially for the price. I still can't get over how huge the 64\" is. Aside from movies, I do a lot of 3D gaming via Nvidia 3D vision and it works great on this tv. My main gaming pc uses amd video cards and I was hoping to try AMD's 3DHD out, but unfortunately it isn't supported with this model, but 3D vision works well enough that it doesn't bother me.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture Quality for Great Price", "Author": "Brandon Loyd \"Brandon\"", "ReviewID": "RA2F2UUQI5YH5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a 4 year old DLP TV by samsung also.

Movies with the dark scenes, I can see reflection of me and others right on the screen. Also the lights around the room will reflect it. I mounted the TV at eye level on the wall, when sitting on the couch. If you mount it higher, then your self reflection might not be bad, as you are viewing it in an angle, rather than straight on. This is probably more personal choice than a con per se, just like some people love iMac LCD screen that is glossy while some people hate it.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad Customer service and poor product", "Author": "Atiq ur rahman khokhar", "ReviewID": "R4VSOCGGNVI5A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my first samsung TV and I am really disappointed both on TV and customer service I am getting.

When I asked for manager he told me that no manager is working on Friday morning 0900 and they will come back on Monday.

I have had the samsung 59\" plasma for only a few weeks but the color is fabulous the greens are greener reds more brilliant and I do notice the blacks are blacker. When playing a bluray the picture is much sharper with more clarity. I do notice a mirror effect from the black areas of a picture which means I get a great picture of myself and every thing behind me. But that is the only time it is prominent. I am diapointed in the fact that there are so few 3D movies out on blue ray and the fact that they are so expensive to buy. The anaglyph movies I don't find worth buying, after purchasing 15 movies. Most of those are hardly watchable even thru the bluray disc player. On bluray I have \"Green Hornet\" and \"My Bloody Valentine\" 'Shark Boy and Lava Girl\", The 3D on the \"Green Hornet\" pretty good but not spectacular. I would like to see a 3D version of \"Avatar\" but I understand there is only 17 minutes of 3D in the movie and that through panasonic is the only way to purchase one unless you go to ebay they are available for $75.00 and up. The samsung 3D glasses are expensive (I got 4 pr for $195.00). they are a little uncomfortable for a 2 hr movie. But the novelty is still there for me. I did not buy the 3D for what is available now but I am hoping to have this TV for 8 to 10 yrs.

And I do understand a thing or two about image quality, display technology, image processing algorithms, and so on (it's what I deal with for a living). I say that only in order to emphasize how amazing this TV really is.PROS:As they say in real estate - location, location, location. With TVs it's for me picture quality, picture quality, picture quality. I have only two years ago bought the first flat screen, because I was not willing to fork over a lot of money for a technology inferior to conventional CRT displays in every aspect but size. The first buy was a 37\" LG LED for the XBox - not bad at all. But nothing I have seen in the past compares to the amazing picture quality of this Samsung plasma unit when connected to a good HD soure. All the basics  - real and perceived resolution, color reproduction, contrast, are just deeply statisfying, no other way to put it. I have that unit for two months and I am still baffled occasionally. I had no issues whatsoever with burn-in and I didn't do any special procedure at the beginng, the user manual says there is no need to do that, so I didn't.On top of that you get really good 3D capability as well, with only one problem not specific to this product: There is just very, very little quality content in 3D out there.CONS:The first set arrived defective right of out of the box, with HV breakdown noise and no picture whatsoever. The second works like a charm, knock on wood. One of the 3D glasses in the box also didn't work. So quality control does not seem to be a great focus at Samsung. I have heard other complaints in that direction.Bottom-line:Right now Samsung plasma TVs are the best deal out there if you want amazing image quality in larger screens at a very reasonable prize. I always research the market before I make a major purchase and I was prepared to pay a lot more (2-3x) for a similar size backlit (not edge!) LED unit. But looking at this TV next to the latest backlit LED models I could not find one good reason to pay that much more.

The screen is crystal clear and the colors are great.Apparently this TV uses the same panel as the higher end d7000 series and you can actually go into the root menus and change it so that the television thinks it is a d7000 series. This opens up some extra calibration settings that aren't originally available. Of course, it doesn't have the same hardware as a d7000 though (I think that TV has an extra filter for even more improved blacks or something...not exactly sure).I'm not sure really how the TV does it, but the 2D to 3D conversion is actually pretty cool. It's not eye-popping but it's noticeable when turned on. I have yet to actually watch something that is designated for 3D so I can't comment on that just yet.The USB port to view media is a nice feature. It's not the perfect solution though. A designated media player like a Boxee or an HTPC (what I use) is definitely a better choice in terms of visual quality (the exact same file looks better when played through my HTPC compared to directly through the TV's USB port) but if you don't have either of those options, the USB connection is quite capable.I don't know how common it is for TVs these days, but the base that comes with the set rotates which was a nice bonus that I wasn't expecting. I don't have to rotate it very much since my sofa is directly in front of the screen, but I can turn it to the left or right should I want to watch from a different angleCons:The screen is glossy. The trade off for this is better colors but it is very reflective of light so for best viewing experience, curtains should be closed with the lights off. If the room you are putting this TV into has lots of light coming in through windows or whatever, you may want to pass on this TV (but it might not bother you). I only notice reflections when I look for them. Otherwise, I'm too focused on what I'm watching for it to really be a bother.When walking past the TV I can feel a pretty good amount of heat being emitted. Coming from a 32\" LED to this 59\" plasma makes this noticeable to me but it was to be expected from the little bit of research that I did. If this is a concern of yours, this TV might not be for you.Of course the wattage used for this TV is going to be higher than that of an LED television but considering this TV is probably about half the price of an LED TV with the same specs, it's really a matter of if you want to pay more up front for monthly savingsI haven't gone through the manual yet to figure out how to do it so I haven't been able to view anything at 600Hz. When I turn the TV on, it has a display in the corner that says 1920x1080 @ 60Hz so that's all I've seen so far.

I've never had a TV this big and I'm blown away by both the size and the quality of the plasma display. Video games have never looked better, and HD content really pops. It's almost overwhelming (it's probably in a room too small for it).On 3D: Yes, it's a total gimmick. You don't need it and if you're anything like me, you'll leave it off 99% of the time. 3D gaming is definitely kind of interesting and I've played both Resistance 3 and Killzone 3 in 3D. It definitely adds something to the experience but it's harder on the eyes and the colors are dimmer. It's a tradeoff.I wish Samsung had seen clear to giving this TV apps but it's nothing that can't be solved by your favorite gaming console or a $50 Roku 2. The TV DOES have an ethernet jack which can be used for updating the firmware and DLNA capabilities...both work well. If you're going to buy a Wifi adapter for it, I recommend steering past the official Samsung stick and looking for something with the same chip set at a fraction of the price. Google for alternatives.Finally: Yes, this TV buzzes. But I'd wager 90% of plasmas have a buzz to them. It's just the nature of the beast. I did eventually get a little annoyed and was able to schedule a technician to come out within a few days using Samsung's automated form. It worked really well. The tech came out and said that the buzz was slightly louder than normal but that replacing boards is a dangerous game, the next one could be even worse. So he said if it gets much worse to call Samsung, be nice, and they'll replace the TV (he added some helpful information to the notes on the case).

To say this is to state the obvious a bit. Point is, once you've watched true 1080p on the PN51D550 everything else, DVDs and SD content, etc., will disappoint you. I now expect the same HD PQ in everything I watch. I expect the same Sports broadcast (Comcast) or BluRay quality all the time; Most news and other network broadcast shows are mostly broadcast in 720p; certainly this is true for older so called HD productions. Is it because the PN51D550 displays non-1080p content poorly or is it that the true HD picture quality is so good? I don't know. All I can say is that 720P content (and less) will not be acceptable to you anymore. NetFlix and AppleTV will not be good enough. I'm streaming HDX movies from VUDU now and have mostly abandoned Netflix via xbox 360 and iTunes via AppleTV...I'm completely spoiled.Hope this helps.****Okay, now that the title of this review has your attention let me address the single flaw of this beautiful panel TV. It is very reflective of everything in its surroundings while showing dark scenes, and especially when it is OFF. The PN51D550 would make a very effective mirror. It is not suited for bright, sunny rooms or where there's any lighting in its view.  I won't watch Batman or Tron during the day, that's for sure.However, with that said, I still recommend this Samsung.  It produces a beautiful picture once you calibrate the settings - so don't freak out when you first turn it on because the picture will be very dark, whites will look beige (or grey), and the shadow detail horrible.One of the first things I watched first was one of my son's baseball games we videoed in HD on our Apple TV. Plainly said, it was awful--just really bad and immediately sent my son into the garage to get the box so we could return it. Then I found the Dynamic Control setting and set it OFF. Immediately the image quality and colors came to life.You will also need to set Cell Brightness setting up beyond 16 (as well as set high Brightness and Contrast) to get anything close to white rather than a cream color that's miserably masquerading as white. But once you do this you will have the picture quality to be proud of and thoroughly enjoy.The picture quality and beautiful style of the TV is reason enough to give it 4-Stars. The sound is also decent, though not nearly acceptable enough to match the quality and size of the images flowing from the screen. 3D is awesome. Menu is easy to use. Look...I've read hundreds of reviews about all sorts of panel TVs, from the low-end to the highest and most expensive brands. There's seems to always be something that you can find that might not make it perfect. With this TV I haven't seen brightness pops or any other thing that most people comment on plasmas...other than the reflection issue, that is. No buzzing/humming or heat issues. It's not perfect but I love it just the same.How nice is this TV. Well, it is still sitting in our bright family room right now.  We're a working and active family. We're hardly home during the day watching TV. Any other viewing time or room setting you won't have a single complaint about it, especially when you can pick one up for a very reasonable price.

I had owned a Panasonic plasma but, when it finally conked out after 6 years, I wanted to replace it with something I thought would be better.  I went to the big Samsung store in Columbus Circle (NYC) and decided to order this one after talking with one of the workers there.  The focus of our conversation was reliability.  The reason I wasn't buying another Panasonic was that it had broken down after only 13 months and died for good after only 6 years.  I feel that when I spend this kind of money I should get something of better quality.  The salesperson at Samsung made the claim that this TV was designed for nearly 10 years of continuous play without breaking down or loss of picture quality.  I was sold.Imagine my surprise when barely 7 months after purchase, my new plasma TV wasn't working.  Then came the worst part: it took two weeks to get the TV fixed.  For all that I was unhappy with my Panasonic breaking down after 13 months, they deserve credit for getting out the very next day and fixing it.  They even charged me nothing, though I was technically almost a month past the expiration of my 1-year warranty.With the Samsung, my service experience was very different.  My wife discovered the TV not working on a Thursday morning.  After spending an hour or so on their website trying to diagnose the problem, I was assigned a company to come out and fix it.  Unfortunately, when they called Thursday afternoon, they told me they couldn't come out until at least the following Wednesday.  Friday morning I called Samsung back and the woman I spoke to promised me that a repair person from a different company would come by on Saturday.  On Saturday, a person from the new company called and said he was only calling to schedule an appointment for the following week and, even then, he wasn't sure he could fix it.I spoke with Samsung again, and was promised a repair person for Wednesday.  I'm essentially back to where I started.  So now it's 6 days in and a repair person from a third company arrives.  He works for about an hour and he tells me he can't fix it because he needs to order a part.  The soonest the part will be in is the following Tuesday.The final insult comes when I'm called on the next Monday and told that the repairperson can't come out on Tuesday.  He's booked until Thursday.  So it ends up being two weeks to the day before the TV is finally repaired.Perhaps I'm being over-sensitive, but my household is a bit different from most, I guess.  We don't have a TV in every room--just the one plasma on the wall.  And during a two week period when my wife was at home recovering from surgery and my two kids were on summer vacation from school, I could have used a working TV.  Besides, I'm sick of this low-quality, planned obsolescence world that we live in now.  Products should be built to last and certainly, if something goes wrong, it should be fixed ASAP with high-quality service.  Unless this now-repaired TV lasts for the 10 years I was originally promised, I can assure you my next TV won't be a Samsung.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Chadillac", "ReviewID": "R3LCKM7JZT9OVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dont be fooled by the low (200,000:1) Dynamic Contrast ratio.

The color too looks nice.  Strangely the default setting out of the box looks rather bad.  One has to tweak the TV before getting a nice image.  The 3D works without problems.  The 2D to 3D conversion, in fact,  works stunningly well.The bad:Like all Plasma TV's the D550 suffers from image retention.  While it doesn't retain the images as quickly as other Plasmas do, once the ghost images are there it takes a long time for them to go away.  If you watch a letterboxed movie, expect to see the ghost image of the letterboxing for another half hour after the movie.  Watching two letterboxed movies in a row is probably not a good idea as this may cause a permanent burn in.  Obviously connecting a gaming console to this TV is asking for damage.  Like other plasmas too the TV has an image scrolling function that is supposed to remove retained images.  However while my LG plasma will take care of this in minutes, or even seconds, this Samsung may take over one hour to do the same.  In fact running a 16:9 show works faster than the image scrolling designed to clean up the image.The ugly:When watching 2D content over HDMI the TV features the often reported image popping.  Something in the TV automatically adjusts the black levels during dark scenes.  The reason this TV gets a lot of high ratings is that standard TV viewers probably won't notice this, or don't care.  However for anyone who likes to watch 1080p movies, this is obvious, and will soon turn into a distracting nuisance.  It does not happen during 3D playback.  Samsung claims to have a fix for it, but it requires a repair technician to fix your brand new TV.  I'm not sure if this is true, because Samsung first claimed that a firmware upgrade would fix it, which once it arrived in the mail, changed nothing.In the end I decided to box the unit back up, and return it.

First, the delivery of the tv was not what the anticipated delivery date was.  It was a week off which is a big gap compared to an understandable couple of days.  Next the delivery company did bring it in unpackaged it half way to plug it in to make sure it was working.  It turned on so they unplugged it and said keep the box (which takes up a room pretty much) and they did not put on my stand as said they would.  I think they told me to keep the box because their truck was full as my tv delivery was the first drop off that morning.  So the delivery company did not do as described.  So now I get the stand put together and the tv attached, and then put it on my entertainment stand.  Hook all my devices up to and I am testing out all inputs etc.  Everything looks fantastic and I am very pleased with the picture quality.  Then all of sudden the tv goes out after 10 minutes of use!!  I call Samsung and they set up a \"in home repair\" which the repair company set up for the following week.  I could have returned all together but then they would have to schedule a pick up, then have to purchase again and wait for delivery.

The fact that it was 3D and also the picture quality.  I have now had the TV for 4 months and I have to say I am not happy with my purchase.  I have a LCD in my bedroom and the picture quality is easily 3 times sharper and clearer than this Samsung Plasma.  The plasma lacks the depth and clarity that the LCD has.  I contacted Samsung to find out if there was anything I could do to increase the picture.  They recommended that I update the software.  I did the update and the picture was the same so they sent out a technician to repair it.  The tech came out and wanted to see the problem so I put the same show on both TV's.  He agreed that the LCD was a vastly greater image than on the Samsung in the living room.  He said that was the difference between a plasma and LCD.  I contacted Samsung again to see if there was anything else and they said no and that the TV was performing as it should.  I would not buy this product again and I feel that I am cheated out the picture quality that I paid for.
