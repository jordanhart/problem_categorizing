Arnold", "ReviewID": "R108RFXEA2IL5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this a year ago for my dorm off of some extra summer wages, and it worked wonderfully on top of my desk while barely taking up any space.  The image quality is very nice (not HD, but nice).  I go to school and live on opposite coasts, so storage is an issue, the slim size, once again, is clutch, and it looks good.  I have it in storage and can't wait to get it back in the fall. 15 inches is enough to enjoy movies or TV casually, especially on the desk for a quick study break.I've seen complaints about the sound, its certainly not Bose but it is on par with other tvs of similar size, and will do for casual use. It has a headphone jack, so if you have good computer speakers (particularly if it has a subwoofer), you can plug in easily for when you want better sound for a movie or sports and switch right back over.  Has all the inputs you need for dvd, games, cable, sound, and even a vga input to double as a monitor if you wanted.Overall, if you need a TV for a small room, this is great for a desktop situation.Worth the extra 50 or 60 bucks to save space.Whether your a student buying your own or a parent buying for your son or daughter: this is an affordable solution.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Poor sound quality negates otherwise fine lcd tv", "Author": "Achiever", "ReviewID": "R23AXZ97KXT066", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this on impulse without researching brands when I was shopping for a small tv. The sleek design appealed to me and thought it would be handy to have the option of a second computer monitor. However since I'm using it primarily as a tv, the tin sounding speakers ruin it for me. A very poor performer unless it will be used purely as a monitor.", "Date": "September 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Poor sound hard to adjust", "Author": "Robert F.

From 12 feet away the sound is tinny and acceptable only if the bass is turned way up and the treble is turned way down.  The picture is not crisp and the background is too black.  If I adjust it brighter everything turns washed out.  I expected more.  I use it with ear phones and over a treadmill so it is acceptable for the price.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "GREAT PICTURE, POOR SOUND, GREAT FOR PLAYING VIDEO GAMES", "Author": "GAVELFALL", "ReviewID": "R1CA062WSIDMO4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv to play video games on. I am very happy with the picture quality, however the sound is poor. I would not buy this if you want it for a primary tv, but it is nice for what i want it for. I have it placed next to a Sony LCD 42\" that i use to watch tv on. If you decide to buy this tv, check Walmart. I paid $199.00 + $17.00 for a 2 year extended warranty.

The picture is very good but the DC motor of the treadmill sends minimally bothersome interference across the screen.  The sound is very tinny and true to other reviews gets worse when the volume is increased.  Since I plan to use the earphone jack and the price of the set is reasonable, I can live with it.

I never sent it back because every time I was about to the problem would go away.  Now the problem seems to be permanent.  The problem only happens with TV and S-video, not the computer VGA input.Also, changing channels is annoying because there's a 2 second pause between channels.  Very annoying.Don't bother with Magnavox.
