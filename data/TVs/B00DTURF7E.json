{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Product intended for the hospitality / hotel industry?", "Author": "Kenneth", "ReviewID": "R12XHLGKQ6XFUH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Why is this being marketed this way (through Amazon) directly to the consumers, when the TV is intended specifically for \"commercial\", hotel use? I had a technical question post purchase and I called the 800 number and was told I need to contact the \"industrial\" support. Then I am told \"I only handle only \"cameras etc\" so you would need to call the same number but select option 4.... If you go to Panasonic's website and search by the exact model number, it is nowhere to be found!I ordered this for an older lady who wanted something simple to use, economical, flatscreen, reliable. The selection was essentially made on Amazon in a short time, primarily based on the brand (Panasonic > well known, good brand) and price. Picture quality is good. It's very simple to operate, has no complicated menus to navigate even when configuring the TV. So in this particular case, it worked out but if anyone is purchasing this TV, BE FOREWARNED.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$479.00", "Features": "UPC: 885170123076\nWeight: 22.000 lbs", "Name": "Panasonic TH-32LRU60 32-inch Class 720p Hospitality LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51suDdguxRL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DTURF7E"}}
