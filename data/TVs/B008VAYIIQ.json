At first I didn't think the picture was very clear, but then I exchanged my old cable box for an HDTV cable box (free exchange at the cable company).  Now the picture is amazingly bright and clear.  I adjusted the color a bit, and it's perfect!", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great mid-size LED", "Author": "vifmxol", "ReviewID": "R2VWZUMJMWMQFP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good picture, PC imput, low power consumption, seems good to me, I don't have problems with the remote. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's a little slower changing channels than I would like it to be.

Shipping was prompt (as expected with Amazon) and both tv's came in perfect mechanical and cosmetic shape.Another reviewer talked about the picture turning brown or red - I have never experienced this; I find the picture and sound to be pretty good.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "32L2200U 32-inch", "Author": "knives", "ReviewID": "RZFUC7LYG5KHL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice TV for the bedroom.

Most of the big named TV manufacture\u2019s had a physically larger size that this Toshiba 32L2200U TV. Granted I was unsure of Toshiba brand but I was limited in my choices. I have been very satisfied in the operation and the picture quality. This TV even surprised me by automatically changing the input source from cable to video when my DVD player starts.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap but good", "Author": "jmichaelss \"jsramek\"", "ReviewID": "RGSTJXE3XXUV6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price, a nice TV. Perfectly functional and easy to adjust color settings. It has audio outputs so you can hook it up to the stereo for better sound. The remote is easy to use (not backlit unfortunately), with the \"input\" button right on top, so you can switch back and forth between TV, Roku, DVD, etc. My only complaint is that you have to reset the picture size every time you change input type. If your expectations are high, I'd recommend something fancier; if you just want to watch Hulu or Netflix, this TV will do just fine.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's an LED TV", "Author": "Gr8shoes \"Toots\"", "ReviewID": "R16TSAK88JOTX7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Picture is clear, it hooked up quickly & easily to my AppleTV .  I erred in assuming it had a built in HDTuner since most teevees do these days, and have not found a decent antenna to pull in the signal yet, but I have AppleTV and so Netflix Hulu Plus and Aereo can all be broadcast via it.  It is a decent tv for a decent price. nothing to write home about, it's a television", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "Robert J.

I have never had a Toshiba TV that I didn't just love, really.  They have always outlasted my residencies and the picture and functionality is great.  I like how the mute button cuts the volume in half, and then on the second push, all the way.The only draw back this model could have, is that it only has 2 HDMI ports.  Mom's VISIO has like, 5.It is a bedroom TV that I have hooked up to a Tivo HD DVR and it works as good as the TV I gave to my neighbor when I moved.  (He LOVES my \"old\" Toshiba, by the way.)  Also, the delivery time was VERY fast from the vendor AND Amazon.

Sometimes the remote acts funny and I have to get closer to the television for the remote to actually work.
