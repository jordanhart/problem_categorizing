I had this tv for 20 days and i love every second of it. Im comming from a big giant 19inch box tv that my parent had in 1999 and was passed on to me. Big big big diffrence in color and type of tv. Insignia is a O.k kind of brand.. My cuosins owns a insignia Tv 19inch flat screen. Only last him less then 4yrs. I think thats good enogh for me for a nice name brand.. I went to bestbuy store in my city and they had this tv for sell on sell that day for $179.99 wow what a price. plus I got the geek squad 2yr warranty for $24.99  .. So if anything happens to the tv bestbuy will fix it or replace it within the 2yr warranty. Witch I don't care because after two years I plan on upgrading to a known name brand. So this is  Very nice and big lliterly. The color is un believable or maybe its becuse its my first KIND of TV. And then i went to buy the PS3 bundle at gamestop and it was a deal. My new ps3 with HDMi cable connected to this tv looks so real. You can see every detail on the body of the person In the game. Well not only that but it also gets digital Tv anolog over the air antenna. I get 68 channels and thats perfect because I can't afford  cable, but wow you can see every single detail on the face of news casters on tv, the news people are very wrinkled and sweaty faces, lol very big flat screen with amazing HD picture and the volume on this is perfect very loud. Tv is very light and when I move around the room I can still see the tv on good color. Some other tv gets there color darken when seen from the rear sides but with this insignia tv there is no problem..", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Godstime Emuobe", "ReviewID": "RHWH4VC3N95HY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is awesome.

Now it is outdated and will not play new Blu rays . We called Insignia regarding this, and they said tough luck. One manager went as far as you say the customer is always wrong. Please spread the word on this share this with everyone you know. I can't believe a company would be so awful. After 3 years a Blu ray player will not work on new movies anymore . That is ridiculous not to mention it's environmentally harmful to make an electronic that will only last three years ! Please share this with everyone. Do not buy Insignia!", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Insignia 32\" Class (31-1/2\" Diag.) - LCD - 720p 60hz - Hdtv", "Name": "Insignia 32\" Class (31-1/2\" Diag.) - LCD - 720p 60hz - Hdtv", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-WfAwuWjL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EW0TA5A"}}
