After installation it worked well, sharp colors and exceptional quality even with non HD cable channels. Unfortunately after just two days the system failed. Power  would not come on as it developed an electrical fault. I tried having it exchanged but they were out of stock without reorder so it seems like this is an already or soon to be discontinued model. Changed to another brand and now awaiting exchange. If you decide to get one you are certain of excellent qualaity picture as long as it works.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Superb deal", "Author": "Kanoknop Johnston \"Honey\"", "ReviewID": "R29V0UO6X7E8TS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Paid just over $1,000 from amazon delivered.  Comparable 50\" 720p offerings from Samsung and Panasonic are typically going for more than this.  This is my second Hitachi plasma, I paid $6,000 for a 42\" when I was living in Japan 4 years ago; it's still going strong, no burn issues and a truely superb picture so I had no reservations going that way again.Pro's+good connectivity set off to the side (this is important because with a tv this size it's difficult to reach around to the middle of the back)+good colour, good blacks, excellent picture+sleek looks, bezel is a glossy piano black, speakers are well hidden and manual controls are on the side out of eyeshot+price, 1080i for the price of a 720p, falling between two stools makes for a bargain imo.+ir window is off to the left side so doesn't get blocked by my centre speakerCon's-stand doesn't swivel, not an issue for me as it's (eventually) going on the wall-it's heavy, probably no more so than any other, but please bear this in mind when deciding on placement.DeliveryI've read various comments about the shipping agents amazon used to send this - Pilot.  Amazon's systems don't link with Pilot's in the same way that UPS does so the amazon updates are almost useless, Pilot itself then sub contracts out the local delivery to a third agent - this all seems a little low tech and inefficient when compared to UPS/Fedex.  The upside though is that while this is less than seamless if you do end up calling Pilot you will talk to real people who are extremely friendly and happy to help.  The delivery guy they used was superb and didn't have his hand out for a tip either...The human touch is, again imo, important with regard to the delivery of this product because unlike most of the UPS deliveries you can't just dump this outside the garage door....", "Date": "December 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love this plasma", "Author": "Pdesai", "ReviewID": "R3LL88GLSGQ6GC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this TV shipped to me from amazon and I'm really happy with it.Pros:- Great picture quality, especially for football games in HD, video games (using an hdmi cable works best), and movies- Deep, rich blacks and vivid bright colors comparable to if not better than similar plasma TVs from Sony, Panasonic and Samsung. Not even comparable to the bland colors you see on LCDs- Elegant black gloss finish on the sides and stand.- Plenty of HDMI ports at a convenient place- Swiveling stand at the touch of a remoteCons:- Dissipates a lot of heat, but this isn't much of a problem in larger rooms. However most plasmas release more heat than LCDs, so take the room you want the TV to be in into consideration because the Hitachi's heat dissipation is probably not too much more than that of another plasmas at similar sizes", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "HD1080 resolution greater than 720p\nTable Stand included\nSwivel Stand included\n3 HDMI (v. 1.3 with x.v.
