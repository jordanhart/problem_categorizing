Searching for a Tv to use strictly as a display has become increasingly difficult. With integrated apps and WiFi connectivity, most 65\" displays are at least twice the price of the 65HT2U. What is stunning about this unit goes to its use. With an outboard TiVo and AppleTV as sources, the picture quality is amazing. Sure, a 70' Sharp Elite will perform better. But you can buy 7 of these for the price!!! As a THX and ISF certified calibrator, I am amazed at how well this bargin basement Tv performs. In my opinion, it delivers 90% of the performance of the high0end displays for less than 1/2 the price. If you want a Samsung 8000, you need to take a 2nd mortgage and get one. If you want a giant flat screen, this is one to consider. Be aware, this is a back-lit LCD. it s at least 4\" thick and quite heavy. In addition, the LCD is bright. Spend the time/money to get it professionally calibrated or you can use it as a tanning booth.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "65ht2u", "Author": "Dman", "ReviewID": "R3MC885ILRF2GE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace a 50 inch panasonic viera plasma 720p. The panasonic is a great tv but i wanted something bigger.  This tv will not disappoint you.  Adjust the picture just a bit and put a good hd signal to it and all will be well.  I set the signal at 720 and saw the blurry fast action movement that i've read about but switched to 1080 and no problems.  My friends buy movies and come to my house to watch them.  I use att uverse hd and i wouldn't change a thing.  Buy a nice bluray player and get netflix movies and you will be impressed with your tv.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really like it except for the glare.", "Author": "Ionia Martin \"Ionia\"", "ReviewID": "R2GX7ABSPI6A3T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV has excellent color and a beautiful display. I like that the features are simple to understand and yet it has a lot of features to choose from. The sound is excellent and with the addition of a home surround system it sounds just like being in a movie theater. The remote can be programmed to do multiple functions and the set up was pretty straight forward. The response time is great and Shark Week was terrifying on this TV (yes that was important.) Pretty much everything in the menu is interactive and fully adjustable for the viewer's preference. I love that it has the theater wide settings for optimal viewing as well.The only real problem I have with this TV is that there is a screen glare issue. My living room has a giant picture window and no matter where I put the TV there is still a glare. Otherwise I think this is a great TV for the price and would highly recommend it for the movie buff.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good tv, if it's working", "Author": "Ally", "ReviewID": "R1W4Y8XYZSUXVC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv at another retailer for sale on Black Friday. 3 weeks later the picture went out and now 30 days after I called the tv still isn't fixed, apparently the part is on back order and the only option they will give me is to take the tv back for a refund or wait for the part. They will not replace the tv. Problem is, the store doesn't accept returns on electronics after 14 days and I can't get anyone in customer service to help me. I used to think Toshiba made a great product, and they still may however their customer service department is horrible. I wouldn't do business with them again.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "great  tv", "Author": "erich", "ReviewID": "R1O0EG2FDLLJ9K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great  tv but  doesn t  have  analog  audio  out so  you  need  the  optic  plug,  plus  if  your  home  theather  doesnt  have  optic  audio  input  you  will  need to  get an  optic  to  RCA  converter.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow.  This is best deal out there!", "Author": "R. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1UPKAZJYCE21H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I happened to be shopping at Walmart for a boat cover and walked by the TV department.  There were two large TV's and one looked razor sharp compared to the other.  One was a 70\" Sharp model and the other was the 65\" Toshiba.  The picture on the Toshiba was clearly much better compared to the Sharp.  Then I looked at the price and couldn't believe that the Toshiba was almost half the price of the Sharp.  So, even though I was not shopping for a TV, I ended up taking one home.  The Toshiba replaced my 50\" Panasonic Plasma.  I absolutely love my new TV.  The only complaint I have is that at extreme viewing angles the color washes out compared to my old TV.  But, I think this is something peculiar to LCD's versus Plasma's.  Since then I've compared this effect in various stores and noticed that the Toshiba is about the same as other LCD's.  Also, it's kind of interesting that since I bought my TV I've been to several Walmart's where I've seen the Toshiba next to the Sharp.  Sometimes the Toshiba looks better, other times the Sharp looks better.  Obviously some stores tweak or adjust the Toshiba to look better and other times times they tweak the Sharp.  In the case of my TV, I haven't felt the need to make any adjustments.  I love my new TV and feel this is the best TV purchase I've ever made.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bigger is best!", "Author": "Boyd Fellows Sr", "ReviewID": "R31M0M2IT91A8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This new Toshiba 65-inch TV set looks great, works great.

They sent t on time and safe. We like this perfect TV so much! My friend spent around $800.00 for 45\" TV that has no VGA input!I connect my laptop and browse Internet everyday on this big screen TV and enjoy! I recommended to buy this big screen tv with almost half price of other same size expensive brands! I suggest you walk in Walmart and compare Toshiba 65\" quality with other expensive brands, then you will see difference between this perfect TV and others!
