{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture and pretty good sound too", "Author": "W. Jessup", "ReviewID": "R42I0X4118I57", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first mention that Amazon has the dimensions of the TV wrong, they seem to be for the TV shipping box and not the TV.  The TV is 35\" wide, 23.3\" tall with stand (20.7\" without), and 8\" wide with stand (3.3\" without).  It weights less than 20 pounds, it is very easy to move.The stand had to be attached to the TV.  You may have to look at the picture instructions a few extra seconds to understand them, I am a little old school and am still use to word instructions.  After you figure out the diagram, it takes about a minute to attach the stand.Setup is fairly easy, a alpha/numeric keyboard automatically pops up when needed to make entering network names and passwords easy.  The TV menus are easy to use and are accessed using one button on the remote, setup.  The remote is easy to use also, similar to a DirecTv remote.  In fact, I setup the Toshiba 'IR Blaster' to control my DirecTv box rather than using two remotes.There was a firmware update available when I turned the TV on the second time.  Easy to install, just pushed a few buttons.  There will be more in the future.The apps are in the cloud, but most aren't available at this time.  I will update this review as they become available.  Some of the major apps usable now are Netflix, Cinema Now, HuluPlus, Pandoria, Skype, and YouTube.  There's a Netflix button on the remote, press it and you're there.  The Netflix app has the same layout as their website, very easy to navigate with only arrow keys on a TV remote.I decided not to set-up surround sound for this Toshiba TV because I wanted to hear how good or bad the sound was using the normal TV speakers.  The sound is pretty good for a thin TV, so good that I haven't bothered attaching the cable for surround sound just yet.Also, it was easy to wirelessly connect the TV to my home PC to display shared pictures, movies, and, music.  So easy in fact, that the TV connected automatically.  I didn't need these features and only used them to make sure they worked.  It only saw folders that I had previously set up to be shared.That's about it for now.  I will update this review as more features and apps become available in the cloud.I have been watching quite a bit of baseball lately.  The picture is great, I haven't noticed any blurring at all.  Actually the picture is better on HD sports than on your usual HD network channels but this may have more to do with DirecTv and their Extra Innings baseball programming than Toshiba, but it does give a indication of how good the picture really is.A review update.  Last Night, June 7th 2013, when I turned the TV on, a message appeared saying new software was available.  So, I updated.  Vudu apps was added, well, actually, the icons were there, they weren't accessible until now.  With Vudu apps you now have access to Vudu movies, Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, and various news apps like, CNN Daily, AC 360, NBC Today Show, NBC Nightly News and New York Times Video News.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Advanced features mostly useless", "Author": "Bob Ray \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R369IM359HY5BE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you just want to watch TV and you have a good High Definition source, this TV is probably fine for you (though overpriced for that purpose).Trying to use the advanced features of this TV, however, is an exercise in frustration.To use any of them, you need an internet connection, which works fine if you hard-wire it with an ethernet cable, but the wireless option is finicky about how your network is set up and what your password is. I did manage to set it up for wireless internet, but it took several hours.The TV has a web browser, but the navigation is painful to use, and for most uses, the first thing you want to do is search. That means using the horribly slow onscreen keyboard combined with the slow response of the remote. To add insult to injury, the online manual suggests that you use the wireless keyboard, but as far as I can tell, there is no wireless keyboard available for this model (see update below).One particularly frustrating \"feature\" is that in some modes, the simulated mouse has insufficient resolution to hit small targets on the screen. When watching a YouTube video, enlarging the video hid the controls below the video and I was absolutely unable to click on the down arrow to scroll down and expose them. The cursor would go just to the left or right of the arrow, but couldn't be positioned over it.***The specs say it has two composite and one component input, but this is somewhat misleading. It has one set of shared composite/component inputs (5 input jacks) so you get one composite or one component input. It does have a mini video input, so technically you could probably use it with two composite sources if you had the right cables for that and didn't need the component input.***The marketing material suggests that you can view photos and videos on the box from a USB source, but when I plug in my Thunderbolt Android phone, neither the phone nor the TV know that it's connected. I set the TV to \"autostart\" media share when something is plugged into the USB connection, but I get \"No device connected\" when I plug in the phone, and the same thing when I press the media share button on the remote. I didn't try plugging in a computer or iPhone, but Windows computers generally use NTFS for the file system, and according to the manual, the TV only handles Fat file systems. I have unlimited data on the phone, so it's particularly frustrating that it won't work at all with this TV.The marketing material also suggests that the TV can share media (e.g., photos and videos) with other devices connected to the network. Unfortunately, this only works with devices that have WiDi capability, which is fairly rare, requires a laborious setup process, and still may not work.***It has what appears to be a kick-butt universal remote, with buttons for TV, Cable/Sat, BD/DVD, DVR/VCR, Audio, and Aux. In order to use the universal remote, however, you need to plug in the IR blaster hardware and attach the wired transmitters over the IR receivers on the components. I did get it to work with my Sony receiver, but only for power and volume. After a lot of time spent messing with it, it still doesn't work with my DirecTivo DVR.Even when it works, this is another good example of poor implementation of a good idea. They could have built the IR blaster features into the remote (like any good universal remote), instead you have ugly, visible wires and dongles crapping up the front of your enterntainment system and you're limited to two extra devices (three counting the TV) even though the remote has buttons for six. You can buy piggy-back IR blaster connectors, but then you have even more visible garbage crapping you your system.***There is a downloadable App for controlling the TV using a phone or tablet. I installed it on my Thunderbolt and it works, sort of, but it's incredibly clunky and much more difficult to use than the regular remote. Worse yet, the one thing I wanted it for was to use the keyboard on the phone when surfing the web, which doesn't work at all.***I live in a large city and the TV's tuner doesn't do a very good job of getting the local channels with a table-top antenna. To be fair, I've never gotten a very good signal on some of the channels, but this TV does a much worse job than my old Sony Trinitron did with the same antenna. At least half the channels now have periodic dropouts and pixelization. This may just be a result of going digital.***You can browse the Web with the built-in browser, but there's no Flash player support, so many web videos and a lot of YouTube entries won't play at all. Using the browser to surf the Web is not all that pleasant, so the only thing you really want to do with it is watch videos, many of which won't play on this set. From what I understand, most other \"smart\" TVs have Flash support.____________________________________What does work?The TV has a very good selection of inputs and outputs (the composite and component inputs mentioned above, and 4 HDMI inputs) and they all work as expected. The picture quality is acceptable if you have a good HD source, but if you are feeding it a Standard Definition signal, you'll get a fairly poor picture with lots of noise and artifacts, especially so if you're using the composite input. To be fair, this is true of most HD TVs.***The default color saturation is ridiculously high, but it seems most people want that these days after seeing all the jacked up images on store TVs. The Toshiba also has an impressive set of controls for customizing both the video and the audio and they are input-specific, so you can have different settings for different inputs.***The sound is fairly good for a TV and there is a toslink optical digital output that will give you excellent surround sound with a home theater set up. You can also customize the audio delay so you can use the TV speakers in addition to your home theater without getting an echo.***The remote has a Netflix button that will take you straight to Netflix. The streaming video quality from Netflix is quite good on the set, even with a fairly slow internet connection (around 6 Mb/s).***Another feature that works well is the ability to connect any device with HDMI output, though I think any TV with HDMI inputs will do this. I connected my Kindle Fire with a 15' cable and got excellent results with Amazon Prime videos.***The TV will also update its firmware through your internet connection. An update executed soon after I set it up and worked fine, though I lost the Internet connection after it did so and had to reconfigure my network to work with the updated software. I had to set the router to broadcast the SSID and take the punctuation out of my password. I'm not sure which one was necessary (maybe both). Before the update, the router showed up in the TV's WiFi scan even though the SSID was not broadcast. After the update, I could only see my neighbor's networks until I set the router to broadcast the SSID. Unfortunately, this makes your network much less secure.In SummaryAs I said, the TV's basic functions are fine, but the \"smart TV\" features seem to have been implemented just enough to let the marketing people claim they are there, but not enough to actually use.As another reviewer suggested, you'd probably be better off getting a non-smart TV and a Roku box. The Roku box will also give you access to Amazon Prime videos, which the TV will not.In the first few days of using the TV, it would freeze up occasionally during menu operations. No buttons on the remote or the TV would work (including the power button on the TV). I had to unplug it to get it unfrozen. This has stopped happening, probably because I'm no longer performing Setup operations.[Update]I've had it about 5 weeks now and have a few corrections and more to report.I stand by the claim that this TV is not ready for prime time. As a further example, you can name the HDMI inputs in Setup. This is really important since there are 2 composite and 4 HDMI inputs (labeled HDMI1, HDMI2, etc.) and who wants to keep a note next to your chair reminding you which is which. In setting the input names, you can select any of the built-in names for them (e.g., DVD), or you can create and set custom names for them (e.g., Tivo, Roku). The maddening thing is that no matter how many times you do this, in a day or two, the set will forget them and revert to the default names.I got a Logitech K400 wireless keyboard with a built-in touch pad. It \"works\" with the TV. \"Works\" is in quotes because of the limitations. It works with the TV's onscreen keyboard when in setup (sort of). But it doesn't work for the Roku search box, the Netflix search box, or the Amazon Prime search box -- all three of which I use way more often than I do the TV's setup. To be fair, I don't know if the blame here belongs to Toshiba, Roku, or both.The keyboard *does* work with the Toshiba's built-in web browser (again -- sort of), and makes it much less horrible than it is using the Toshiba remote. The problem (and this is a problem in Setup also) is that the keyboard's effects are wildly inconsistent due to problems in the Toshiba software and User Interface design. Sometimes, pressing \"Enter\" on the keyboard will be the equivalent of clicking on the \"Done\" button. Sometimes, it will do nothing. Sometimes, maddeningly, pressing \"Enter\" will type the letter 'q'. Sometimes, you can select the \"Done\" button with the touch pad. Sometimes you can't.The net effect of all this is that you have to sit there with the keyboard, the Roku remote, and the Toshiba remote, trying various things until you find one that works. I've been unable to find any logic to the differences and suspect that it's just very sloppy programming.The good news is that, at least in the web browser, the touch pad and the two mouse keys on the K400 work as expected and will also let you scroll. If your TV has an internet connection, you can get to the web by just pressing the internet key on the Toshiba remote. You can set the default web page to Google. From there, the keyboard will let you type a search phrase and after that, you can pretty much use the touch pad to do what you want as long as you don't want to watch any Flash videos.[/Update][Update 9/7/2014]This may be of use to others who have this TV. I couldn't figure out why HDTV HDMI signals were being letterboxed on all four sides when they should have been full-screen. It turns out that certain input-specific settings for the TV such as the aspect Ratio used for an input channel are set on a specific menu that can *only* be reached by pressing the \"Quick\" button on the remote. You can't get to them through the setup menu, which only controls settings used for all inputs. The word \"Quick\" implies fast access to settings available elsewhere, so this button is seriously misnamed (as is the \"Settings\" button, which on every other TV on earth is called \"Menu.\"A further frustration is that now every time I turn on the TV, it wants to download an update. If I say Yes, it downloads the update until it gets to 95% then quits with an error. You'd think that downloading and installing firmware updates would be the most solid thing in the software, but apparently not. I haven't yet tried updating it via USB. Hopefully that will work but I'm not counting on it, and as far as I can tell, there's no way to get it to stop asking you to perform an update.[Update 11/27/13]I tried to update via USB. It's tricky because the the USB has to be formatted as FAT and plugged into USB port 1. I downloaded the update to the USB and plugged it into the TV and the result was a notice that I was already up-to-date and didn't need an update. Of course that didn't stop the TV from trying to update every time I turn it on. I finally just gave it the lobotomy it deserved. I disconnected it from the internet and use a Roku3.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this TV", "Author": "Rafael Perez \"rafael6867\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z5FEHA8KG1C6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't understand why all the negative reviews!

I always thought my Sony 46 LED EX had a great picture but I decided that I was going to move it elsewhere in the house. I liked the 46\" size but I thought a little bit larger would be nice so I went looking for a TV 50\" to 60\". Most stores wanted to sell me the larger set but honestly I did not think that the picture clarity was as good as I had with the 46\" Sony. That was until I wandered away from the larger TV's to 50's size. This set was beside a new Sony that was also very nice and much more expensive. I kept looking at both TV's and I felt this one was clearer and overall. I used the remote to change the picture to standard or no enhancements from dynamic and I still felt the color was a higher resolution and more life-like tones. Comparing pricing was an issue and I have had other Toshiba products that were very good so I purchased this TV. Once home, there are so many more things you have to setup these days since these TV's can do so much more than just watching TV. I am very satisfied with this TV and I have no problems with the WiFy connections. Netflix, Hulu Plus, all work well and I have surfed the WEB without any hickups. Do I need the Cloud part, NO and I doubt I will ever use that feature. I like all of the other features and I believe I will really enjoy this TV. I do wish that they had Amazon Prime Video App available but since they don't, I can always use the Blue-Ray for that or I can use the ROKU. The quick start picture is VERY NICE, no more waiting for it to show a display. With the Sony, you have to wait for the SONY logo to end, and the wireless to connect but on this one it is right there right away for you. Would I buy it again, YES, and I did save about $500 USD comparing this to the Sony, LG, and Samsung for a like TV.Update: This TV is problematic. The system freezes up and it will not turn off so I have to unplug it. I reported it to Toshiba and they said that they ordered a new mainboard for it. It has been a month and they have no idea where this mainboard is or when I can expect it to be fixed. This is a brand new TV, and so far I would say that there is no service nor is there going to be any service on this product. This is becoming hopeless. I will not purchase any Toshiba products in the future and no I have to figure out how to get rid of this TV. I really wish now I had bought another product. Good luck to anyone that needs any repairs because I dare say that will never happen.Last update: Three months after reporting the problem to Toshiba, I finally got a call from an authorized repair guy to get a new mainboard installed. Keep in mind that I had already sent the TV back and exchanged it for a Samsung TV which by the way is working great. Toshiba is very unorganized and seems to think that it is OK for their customer to wait 3 months to get a brand new TV repaired. I do not agree so I will no longer own Toshiba products.

The picture, sound, etc. are all very good, but I am extremely disappointed with all the \"smart\" features.  I guess I did not read the other reviews or product information carefully enough so buyer beware!!!The advertisement and product description talk about having this wirelessly connect to your computer but that only works if your computer is WIDI enabled.  I am not sure how many computers have that feature but mine did not and this is not something you can add on if the computer does not have it factory installed ( unless maybe you know how to do that kind of thing yourself).Most disappointing, I thought I could use it to watch shows once they are available on network websites.  Not possible because the TV does not support FLASH which is required.  I did not see this information at all on the TV product descriptions.  There are a few shows, none of which I like, that the TV seems to be able to direct link to, but since I have no interest, I have not tried it.Pandora has never worked, nor does trying to go to a radio station website to listen.  Most websites in general just lock up, so the TV is useless for any website.  BTW, I also upgraded my internet connection to accommodate the TV so I have the fastest available from Comcast (Blaster?).  The TV also does not support Amazon Prime.I have had the TV since July and I have had to do 3 factory re-sets which wipes out all your personal settings and takes over an hour to re-program.  By that time, you missed the show you were going to watch.It is too late and too expensive to return, but I wish I had gotten the LG, which I was also considering, or better yet, just purchase a good regular TV.

I wanted the set for the smart features, in particular the open browser.  What a disappointment.  The set connected right away, but doing anything on it in terms of web browsing (not just point and click) took forever.  There is no keyboard remote.  Next, the internet connnection would disconnect.  This in and of itself would be not big deal, but every time it disconnected, I had to go thorugh the process of putting in the password for the network.  Again with no keyboard, a very time consuming task.  Every morning I would have to go through the excercise.  There is a very strong internet signal feeding it.For point and click internet, I'm sure it is fine...except if it keeps disconnecting as mine did.As a TV, it was fine.  The picture looked good and there were plenty of connections to connect everything.  I LOVED the fact that digital surround sound flowed straight throught the TV via the \"out\" optical cable.  This made getting great sound easy through the receiver.  When I sent it back, I ordered basically the same set without the smart features (39L2300) and the sound does not flow out in the full digital surround mode.  I used the same cables as with the 4300, hooked it up, and while sound does flow through, it is not surround digital.  All settings on the cable box, TV and receive are identical.In summary, not a bad TV, (as evidenced by me ordering the same item without the internet functions)for watching TV, but it you are counting on a really SMART TV....look elseware.As always, Amazon's return process was top notch.

Secondly, it doesn't work very well. I have to be very close and at a certain angle for it to work at all. I'm just going to be using my Verizon remote to control things, since I can't get the Toshiba \"IR Blaster\" feature to work well.Overall, I do like the TV crisp picture and many options for modifying the view to your liking.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Useless software.", "Author": "michael obrien", "ReviewID": "R21JV9HVTI2LWW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As far as being a Television, this unit is fine.

In fact I doubt that it really is 120hz. I notice what I will say is excessive artifacts from motion. Color is great. Sound is much better than any of the super thin led tv's out there. When I did try the smart features, I agree with other comments. The browser isn't that good. Other smart features work ok but the interface is slow.. But if you only have the remote to enter user names and passwords or web addresses, well it can be painful.I feel it's a good tv for what \"I\" paid for it.

I have purchased an earlier Toshiba model prior to this \"Cloud TV\" which I am very happy with, this model is nothing but a waste of space and money.

When I refused to wait for a call back, I was told that they would find me a level 2 technician, put me on hold for 5 minutes, then hung up on me.Out of pure anger, I attempted to \"downgrade\" the TV myself.
