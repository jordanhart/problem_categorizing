Never had a TV stop working so early.  Went to Walmart to see if they could give me another TV, or help me with a solution, but you know the rap \" Well your 90 days warranty from the store has expired\" They suggested to call the ILO customer service number to arrange for parts since the ILO TV comes with a part warranty for a year, Well let me tell you that is another experience of their own.You call the number and an automated computer service center answer the phone and tell you, you are caller number 20, and every 5 minutes will tell you, now you are caller number 19 and so on, until it gets to number one.  Then when it get to your number it will say, we are transfering you to a representative to get your call, suddenly the automated computer picks up the line and tell you all the representatives are busy, please leave a message for someone to call you within 24 hours.Just when you think you will see the light of this horrendous day, the automated machine tell you, you cannot leave a message because the message box is full.  If after all this you still feel like you want to buy this TV, make sure you buy some warranty, and a lot of aspirin pill for the headaches down the road.", "Date": "December 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "adriftinpa", "ReviewID": "RXI81DBST2GE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a Wal-Mart brand made by @ 4 manufacturers. My 26 inch died within a year. You had to turn it on and off and on to get it to work, then the motherboard fried and it is stuck on one channel.This is reported to be a common problem on all their TV's. The TV buttons and remote no longer work. I googled ilo 26 repairs and this is a common problem. Its almost impossible to get repaired or to even find out who made it.
