{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great purchase and a good buying experience-First Impression", "Author": "Jeffrey W. Kite", "ReviewID": "R31WU1GUM851FS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the Samsung 4254 on July 31st and it arrived on August 10th which matched the estimated delivery-time exactly.  The TV was shipped from Harrisburg PA and sent to my  home in central NH. The EGL 'white-glove' delivery was as advertised. The TV was brought into my house, the box was opened so I could check the condition of the TV. The set arrived in original packing and in perfect condition. The delivery men even offered to take the set down to my TV-room. EGL was great!I had been wary of having such a large and fragile item shipped. I saved $200 below the lowest retail price buying this through Amazon. In fact, the item price dropped while the TV was in transit and Amazon refunded the difference within a day. In the end buying through Amazon saved me a chunk of change and eliminated the donkey-work involved in transporting such a large item from the box store. In exchange, I had to wait 10 days for the TV to arrive.Plasma vs LCD:I did a lot of research in the process of settling on the Samsung 4254. Going in, I was convinced that I wanted an LCD because of my concern that the plasma might suffer 'burn-in'. I read in many places that this is not a real concern with current plasma sets. In the end, the decision to go with the plasma came down to the picture quality. I watch sports and movies and the plasma sets just produce a better image. There is far less motion-blur,the colors are more vivid and the viewing angle is wider.The second disadvantage of plasma technology is that the screen is shiny (just like a standard CRT TV). The matte LCD screen is certainly less prone  to problems with glare although the viewing angle can't match what you get with a plasma set. My 'Man-Cave' is in the basement with very little ambient light so this was not a concern for me. Also, the Samsung 4254 comes with some form of anti-glare coating.720P vs 180i and 1080pMore dots on the screen mean better clarity and finer detail. The newest plasma and LCD sets come with support for the highest 1080p resolution. The Samsung 4254 is a 720p set. Should you be concerned that you are buying old technology and that it might be better to pony-up the difference in price (about $400) for a 1080p set? A good question.  There are two facts that I considered before going with the 720p set.1. Broadcasts do not support 1080p as it takes up too much bandwidth so even if you buy a 1080p set, your TV viewing will not be improved. To use the potential of 1080p requires an HD DVD player ($500) and HD DVD's. (about $30 apiece). Also, it is unclear which HD format for DVD's will rule the market (HD or Blu-Ray).2. Viewing a 42 inch screen, the difference between the 720p image and the 1080p image is not discernible. See for yourself. If you have the extra money and the space, consider spending the difference for a larger screen. As the screen size increases, the difference in image quality between a 720p set and a 1080p becomes more visible. Numbers aside, let your eyes be the judge.A few facts about HDTV:If you are buying an High Definition (HD) TV set (Plasma or LCD, you need to have an HD signal to see the full benefit of the HD set. In fact, if you don't have or plan to get access to an HD signal and you plan to use the set for TV viewing, my advice would be to stick with a traditional CRT TV. Most broadcasting is done in standard definition (SD) and most programming  is in SD although more and more content is being created and broadcast in HD. SD programing is formatted to fit the old 4:3 TV screen format. It is possible to stretch this content to fill your new HD screen but it comes with some distortion. Alternatively, you can view the SD image using less than the entire screen. You will not see those stunning images when the program you are watching is SD. SD content looks best on your old TV set but it shows well enough on an HD screen. The Samsung 4254 offers three options for viewing SD content.Digital Cable is not HD:Cable systems offer 'Digital Cable' while this is an improved signal, it is not High Definition. My cable company offers a tier of HD stations with their Tivo-like DVR. For $13 per month I get about 10 HD channels (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, PBS etc)and I get the DVR (which is very cool). To receive the benefit of HDTV, my cable bill will be about $70. Even if you have subscribed to HD stations, you will find that some programming will be shown in SD. In a couple of years, all broadcasters will be required to support HD. New programming generally is done in HD. Just understand that you only get the full benefit of HD when the signal coming to the set is HD.The Samsung 4254:The picture using an HD source, is stunning, if anything better than what you see in the box store displays. The set was easy to set up, it has a swivel stand. I am not nuts about the shiny black bezel but it seems to be the rage these days and it is hard to avoid. If you have bright lights in the room, the bezel and the screen itself will both reflect. The solution is easy; turn off or move the light source. I like the plain low-key styling and the size is perfect for my viewing area.The set virtually programs itself. It recognized and stored all of my cable channels. The color settings were easy to adjust using the remote. The speakers were a source of complaint. I didn't notice any real problem but I connected the set to my surround-sound speakers which is what most people would do.The manual is clear and complete.I bought this set over others like the Panasonic 42 75U because of the picture, the available connections and the price. I have always had good experiences with Samsung products. Once you have decided between and LCD or a plasma set all you really need to do is look at the image quality. I did stay away from off-brand sets because I would be concerned with long-term reliability. Any TV is only as good as the parts it is made of. Generally, you get what you pay for. Manufacturers like Panasonic, Samsung and Sony have a lot invested in their brand-name.Accessories to Consider:If you watch DVD's and don't want to spend $250-500 on an HD DVD player, get an upconverting DVD player (around $100). It will play standard DVD'd and process the signal so that the picture quality is nearly HD. I have too many DVD's to consider re-buying in HD format. I would bet that the price of HD players wwill drop as the technology becomes more common.Also purchase an HDMI cable to connect the player to the 4254. You DO NOT need to buy the $100 cable. Cable prices at retail are absurdly expensive. Cables are not made of caviar. I bought a $10 cable from an Amazon link and the picture is fine. The HDMI cable is the high end HD connection. It carries both audio and video signals. Use HDMI cables between your components that support this standard. My surround sound receiver does not have an HDMI input so I used an optical cable to carry the audio from the TV to the receiver. Always buy the best connection type that your equipment supports.I will revise this review if needed. I hope this is of some help for those entering the world of High Definition.Long story short, I am absolutely happy with the Samsung 4254 and with the purchase experience from Amazon.Added 8/22 Burn-In:Salesmen and manufacturers will tell you that plasma screens don't have a problem with burn-in. This happens when a still image is left of the screen over a period of time. Well, burn in is not a thing of the past. I know this because I left my Samsurng on with the DVD source screen (that blue screen you see as the DVD player is started-up) The image was on the screen for about 12 hours. I now have a \"No Disk\" message burned in the upper right part of the screen. The stupid is always possible.The manual has a section on burn-in and there are three levels of burn-healing technology built into the set so obviously this is not a problem that has been completely eliminated.I ran the 'wipe' mode for about an hour and the image has faded. Whether in time it will be completely gone, I know not. I did have the anti-burn pixel shift enabled.On the other hand, when I am watching programming/DVD, I can't see ANY trace of the burn. It can only be seen when the screen is entirely black. Since I can't see it when I am watching, I am not that concerned. I would buy the Samsung again but I thought that this information should be added.If Plasma burn is a deal-breaker, take a look at the Toshiba Regaza 42 inch LCD. I liked that set but the picture on the Samsung was visibly better. Plasma and LCD technologies have their pros and cons. It comes down to what fits your situation.After 2 weeks, my original impression is unchanged. If I could actually see the results of the burn-in while watching, I would feel differently but I can't, so I don't.8/31  The burn in mentioned in the last segment is gone. Or at least I can no longer see it. I ran the 'wipe' mode for a couple of hours and then as I continued to watch my usual assortment of Red Sox baseball and DVD's, the burn-in just faded away. I have had this TV for three weeks and could not be happier.", "Date": "August 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great picture and great value---what you expect from Samsung", "Author": "Zossima \"Zossima\"", "ReviewID": "RFL8WCTS41WJW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is brand new from Samsung. Two features enticed me to choose this over LCD:* 15,000:1 contrast ratio---this is as high as you'll currently get in a set that goes for around $1500* Anti-glare technologyI've seen friends' plasmas for years. They all had serious glare issues, greater than what were present in a tube tv. The family room in my new house has 20' high ceilings and south-facing 20' high windows. But I see no glare even with the blinds open!I'm thrilled with the picture. HD looks stellar. DVDs look incredible on my up-converting player.The sound isn't exceptional, though it's better than on my 4 year-old tube tv. I have surround sound, so that issue is overcome. The sound is good, though. My advice would be to not let that sway you from buying this. Many brick and mortar retailers have deals for getting a surround-sound system with a new flat-panel tv.Television choices are hard these days. Rear projection DLT offers great price, but you've got to replace the bulbs and the viewing angle is limited. LCDs just might win out in the future, but I still notice slow response (latency) when watching action films or sports. I think plasma still produces the best picture.Samsung's HPT4254 looks to me to be the best value in plasma televisions.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "This TV is AWESOME.  Think twice before you buy an LCD.", "Author": "Jay Stocker \"Jayman\"", "ReviewID": "RDPON9YO3Z8HW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had two LCDs out of the box and hooked up at home.  It's a long story, but we ended up taking both of them back for different issues, one of which turned out to be a bad cable.  CC was so great to take them back and we hadn't considered a plasma because of the glare issue.  Well, I started reading about this Samsung plasma and how that had implemented some sort of anti glare system.  We went back and I realized how much more vivid the colors are on this TV than an LCD.  Plus, I thought the picture on this new model was quite a bit better than any other plasma models on the floor.  We got it home and running and after having the other two LCDs to compare with, this thing ROCKS!!!!!  Even in our bright room, the glare is not a problem for us.  There is definitely more glare than an LCD, but it is so much better.  There is this blurry thing that happens with motion on an LCD.  And, I had read about it, but people were saying it's not so much of an issue anymore with recent models.  I don't buy that after experiencing both kinds of TVs, the plasma is so much more clear with fast motion, and there is so much more depth to the colors.  I'm extremely happy.The only issue I have is with the sound.  It's terrible.  The sound was much better on the LCDs I had here at home.  I have external speakers, so the sound quality is not important to me, but if you care even a little bit about the sound quality, I would consider buying even some low-end bookshelf speakers.  Anything will sound better than the speakers built in to this thing.  The speakers on my 5 year old 27\" tube TV were better.  I still gave it 5 stars, even with this sound issue because if you're in the market for this type of TV, you'll likely have some sort of surround setup and the speakers won't matter.  Buy this TV for the picture and the price.Go see for yourself.... the depth of color and clarity are unmatched in my opinion.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Plasma TV", "Author": "rbhatta \"A Dinosaur you can trust!\"", "ReviewID": "R8R08SGSFMP3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After considerable amount of research I decided to buy this TV, as most of the reviewers on Amazon has pointed out, This TV has the best picture your money can get PERIOD.This TV might not have the latest frills and plethora of unwanted features which most other TVs in the market today, but given for the money you get the BEST Plasma TV in the market.Buy with confidence, this TV is superb, Excellent Picture Quality, Lots of adjustments available for user preferences which most other TVs of this class needs to use Service mode adjustments to get perfect Color and contrast, But this TV right out of the box and factory settings gives you excellent Picture quality.Given the fact that this is a PLASMA Panel, You must follow simple guidelines to make sure that you do not have BURN-in on your display.1. DO NOT watch 4:3 aspect Ratio Material for extended period of time during the initial 150hrs of the Panel's life2. DO NOT play games or display stationary pictures with high contrast for initial 150hrs of the Plasma panel's life.3.  Use the built-in Burn-in protection and correction methods to safeguard your PLASMA panel's life.4. Set the TV to HIGH Energy Saving Mode which reduces contrast and brightness and also save some money on electricity billPROS:1. Excellent HD Picture Quality - Best in its class.2. Built-in TV Tuners have excellent MultiPath rejection and detection for solid stable ATSC reception over the air. Works with Simple Rabbit ear antenna for Local HD channels3. Beautifully designed fits any living room due to it's Glossy Black finish4. Plenty of inputs for all your AV equipments' (3 HDMI and 2 Component + PC input)5. Remembers each AV input's user preference independently.No CONS but just Annoyances:1. Selecting Input sources can be a chore at times as you will have to cycle thru' each input till you get your desired AV equipment, Samsung should have made a menu system to select the input source rather than using the same button repeatedly to select input source.2.  Sound Quality is good, but the volume is low for the size of the TV especially when you watch ATSC content which has 5.1 Surround Sound, This can however be circumvented with an external Home Theater Audio receiver (TV has Optical 5.1 Audio output)3. Picture Quality for some Standard Definition Cable Channel can be grainy unless you tweak the Sharpness and other user settings, but you buy this TV for High Definition content so this is not a big issue.4. Some HDMI inputs are not tweak-able they are fixed and does not have full user settings available in the menu system.SAMSUNG has delivered an excellent product, I am sure you will enjoy your PLASMA TV for a long time.

I bought the Samsung, and am extremely pleased.  The shiny finish also looks great (much better than the dull finish on the Panasonic). For people buying their first plasmas, please note that the 10 watt speakers (which are common for all 42 inch plasmas) are barely adequate.  This is not a criticism of the Samsung; all similar plasmas have 10 watt speakers.  You will probably want to buy a surround system and receiver, so be prepared for the additional expenditure.

Although the packaging was bit suspect, I had assumed it was a new unit...\"it just COULDN'T be burn-in\".I called Samsung (the waiting-time for tech support...about 20 seconds!!!)...and when I explained the problem...they had a technician here the next day!!!The tech filed a report, it WAS burn-in. I had been shipped a demo unit!!!After I notified Amazon of the horrible fulfillmet provided by one of their vendors, they arranged to have the unit picked up immediately.As they had no more 4253's available at the price (1149 delivered), I opted for a sold-by-Amazon 4254, to replace it.It was $100 more...(newer model) but included white-glove delivery (unpacked, placed, and connected to 2 input devices).As for the set.... I love this TV!!! The picture is mesmerizing...with INCREDIBLE contrast. I have a heard a few grouse about the sound, but I have no complaints. Did I say the picture was incredible? It makes me want to watch TV just for the sake of watching. Plenty of controls to adjust virtually every aspect of the picture and sound...with decent presets, though a search of the net gave me some good recommendations. The anti-burn-in feature (pixel-shift) is nice...and there are plenty of inputs. I tried the HDMI connection, but got numerous Piracy-Blackouts from my Cablevision Scientific Atlanta box. Using the component cables gives me an equally stunning picture with none of the hassles...and the cables (35') were much less expensive than their HDMI counterparts...Using an HDMI to DVI cable, and an accompanying audio cable (glorified headphone extension cord), I am able to use the Samsung to watch computer downloaded videos, connecting my PC to my Samsung. As if I wasn't glued to the set enough.Based on my bad/good experience, I have to say Amazon made the process a pleasure..Samsung support seems fabulous...and I can't say enough about the set. The picture is so sweet, glare-free, with delicious, smooth blacks....(15,000 to 1 contrast) it makes me want to cry!Only minor complaint is that I can't jump directly to an input (right?), but have to cycle through the options to choose between, cable-box, Tivo, PC, DVD player, VCR and a few others (inputs can be \"named\").I should be flogged for nit-picking.

When you do dial in the settings, the picture is gorgeous. It comes with a few burn-in reduction features that work very well. I have so far only had a tiny bit if image retention (not burn in) do to user error and it was remedied within 30 seconds of using the TV's \"wipe\" feature. I have watched a number of 2.35:1 DVD's and there is absolutely no problem with the black bars, so I would say don't use any sort of zoom and compromise the movie's framing!HD looks stellar on this set, and it's obviously what it is made for. SD looks OK, better then most flat panels but not great my any means. My DVD player is not up-converting but it produces a very nice picture when hooked  up through component cables.  The Nintendo Wii looks pretty bad (component cables too). There is a lot of \"stair-stepping\" around edges, but the game play still far outweighs this drawback. Computer input is phenomenal as well. There is no ghosting anywhere and no \"clay face\" happening either.The sound is pretty bad and I am in a small room. For any serious watching, get an external sound system.

A.", "ReviewID": "R2LU0K9R1P16PC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up this panel at an after-Christmas sale locally, jumping on the last one in stock.  I came straight to Amazon for product reviews on it, since I had not researched the model itself.Like the other reviews, I have nothing bad to say about the panel, except a few small concerns.  First, the closed captioning display has great configuration options, but only for HD antenna sources--why couldn't the CC text be rendered in translucent boxes (which allow you to see through the black caption boxes) like on the others?  Why is CC disabled on component/HDMI?  This means that watching the last two seasons of the West Wing on DVD allows for no English subtitles (as they only included CC on the discs and not DVD subtitles).Second, adding channels to the Favorites list is extremely tedious--you have to switch channels and work through the menus each time, for each channel.  Pressing the button cycles through them, but doesn't bring up a box to jump to one deeper into the list.  It's obvious they didn't think this feature through very well.Third, the panel's native resolution, like most 42\" plasmas, is 1024x768.  It is therefore not truly 720p, which is a little disappointing.  This is not to say that the electronics on board aren't excellent or that the picture quality suffers at all (on the contrary, this PDP looks superior to many LCDs, the cheapest of which is more expensive than this panel--and even some LCDs that are several hundred dollars more).  It's just something to keep in mind.The positives are many.  The picture is bright, with many adjustment options and rich blacks--colors are vivid without being inaccurate.  There is a full array of aspect ratio options to cope with SD content.  There are 3 HDMI inputs, two component inputs, a VGA input, and two digital tuner inputs, which should be more than enough for anyone's needs.  Channel changes with the tuner exhibited none of the slowness and never once brought up the \"searching for signal\" box, so I imagine the review mentioning that had a weak signal to begin with.HD sources on this TV look amazing.  Smooth, rich, deep pictures with no banding or halos.  SDTV can look a little washed out in comparison, but switching to \"Dynamic\" helps a lot.Sound quality was decent and clear when I tested it, contrary to some earlier reviews here.  I have it connected to a surround system, as most customers probably will, so it does not compare in that regard, but I can find no fault with the internal speakers.  They're loud and a bit bright, but that's to be expected.All in all, this is an excellent and affordable HDTV that looks great even when turned off and makes for a sound investment.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "it's awesome and you know this, MAN", "Author": "R.

With as much TV as I watch, I'm not quite sure what took me so long.  This is the TV I got, and I'm loving it.I live in a condo with a small living room, so this seemed like the perfect size to me.  Compared to my old 27 inch TV, the size is an amazing improvement.  Yet it isn't too overwhelming for my room.Even though the room is small, I wanted something that wouldn't distort if you were viewing it from an angle.  The plasma screen was perfect for that, and I've been very happy.In fact, the HD pictures are so sharp it is amazing to watch.  At times, it still takes my breath away.  I'm actually disappointed now when a show is in regular definition only.  I had to play with the settings when I first got it home to find the ones I liked, but once I did, it looks amazing.  The 720P resolution is great for my needs, and the 15000:1 contrast makes pictures look sharp.  And the regular programming looks great as well, although it is more obvious when the source material is poor then on my old TV.Plasma screens are notorious for their glare, and that is something I considered long and hard before I bought this TV.  There isn't much I can do after the afternoon sun my living room gets (except close the blinds, of course), but the two halogen lamps I have create less glare on this TV then the on my old tube television.I will admit I found the sound to be less then outstanding.  It's adequate, but seems to be awfully quiet.  Additionally, sometimes when I play the sound through my surround sound system, I get a half second difference between the two.  It's not enough to make the lips off, but enough to be annoying.  Naturally, I solve this by turning down the sound on my TV and just using my surround speakers.The TV has features designed to decrease the amount of screen burn in.  Personally, I watch most things in stretch mode (I know, I know), and I haven't had a problem with burn in yet.It only took until I was done playing with the system to have me completely sold.

Taylor", "ReviewID": "RS8B51WV78K71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the unit and it is very good. I may write a longer review later but for now here is what I know:About a week ago I bought a Panasonic PZ77U because I thought, \"Hey, it's a 1080p plasma, the price is ok, it has anti-glare\". However, I wasn't really very happy with the picture, I don't like the shiny bezel, and it's too wide because they put the speakers on the ends. I have the two sets side by side and I'm doing a fair evaluation (Samsung 1080i vs. Panasonic 1080p). To my eyes, the Samsung has a brighter, more vivid picture. Additionally, it does SD better which is very important to me. I thought the PZ77 did good on SD but the 4254 does better. PZ77 does have much better speakers though. I will be doing more comparison for the next couple of days but my current thinking is that the Panasonic is going back.1080p on a 42\" plasma might look slightly better when using a HD-DVD, but all other sources including HD TV programming, SD programming, and SD upconverted DVD's look as good or better on this 1080i set. In my non-techno non-videophile opinion.If you can buy it from Amazon, do so without hesitation. Up where I live in Canada I had to buy it from a big store because Amazon doesn't ship here for these bigger ticket items.Updated: Dec. 2007. I returned this unit because I did not find the glare acceptable. I ended up with a Sony LCD instead and I am much happier. If the glare doesn't bother you, and if you are not going to ever worry about the possibility of burn-in then go for it! For me however, I am much more at peace with my LCD TV.

But while the LCD models I saw when shopping had very good pictures on HD programs I was somewhat disappointed in their performance on standard definition programs which constitude the vast majority of the programs currently available from my cable provider. Of course I wanted a terrific HD picture from HD channels, but I also wanted good standard definition pictures from the non-HD digital channels which I watch most often. Fortunately, a sales person suggested that I check out the plasma TVs they had on display. They had several good HD plasma TVs but this Samsung had the best picture, in my opinion. Conveniently, they had two of this model Samsung TVs on display -- one tuned to an HD program and the other tuned to a standard definition digital broadcast of the same program. Clearly the HD broadcast looked the best, but I was pleased to see that the non-HD digital broadcast was quite good so I bought this model. It looks just as good on both HD and standard definition digital broadcasts in my home as it did in the store. I was also very pleased with the price, because I had been prepared to spend several hundred dollars more if necessary. In summation, this is a terrific HDTV with excellent performance on HD broadcasts and very good performance on standard definition digital broadcasts, all at a very reasonable price.

Unfortunately, this TV is not LCD, it is Plasma. When i called Samsung, I was told that Plasma is not covered under the issue (even though it is the exact same issue). I was referred to local stores to have someone come out and repair it. After calling around and getting estimates, it looks like I'm going to be paying anywhere from $300-$500 to have it repaired.

Simply put, it's an outstanding HDTV, especially for the price.The color is what strikes me first. It's drastically better than almost every LCD set I've come across that's been below $3,000. In general, plasma tv's produce better color output than LCD's, so that in and of itself isn't really surprising.  What IS surprising, though, is just how much more vivid a picture this set has than almost all LCD's and plasmas anywhere remotely in and out of its price range. My dad paid twice as much for his 40\" LCD 1080p, and all he does is comment on how pretty my tv looks everytime he comes over. Same with a close friend of mine who also owns an LCD that cost more than twice as much. I never realized how beautiful reds, yellows, blues, and greens were until I got this set. Yellow has become my new favorite color, strangely enough, because it looks so bloody brilliant on this set. Bumblebee from Transformers blows my mind every time I watch it. It's absolutely beautiful.In terms of clarity, it's again a stunning product. Blu-Rays shine on this set, and I'm constantly showing off Transformers and Planet Earth to the delight of my friends. Also, the contrast on this plasma outshines any and all LCD screens I've tried out, too.I can't comment on the sound because I use my surround sound set-up at all times, but the three or four times I've utilized the factory speakers, they've been fine.My only major gripe is that the factory remote doesn't have preset buttons for each of the input selections. There's only one button, and you have to cycle through the input types until you reach your desired destination. I ended up purchasing the Harmony One remote which already has those inputs programmed in. Sweet!The only other concern I have had is screen burn-in, which has happened on occasion. I'm fairly mindful of it and whatever burn-in my tv has received has always worn off after an hour or so, but I imagine if you play video games with HUDs on them for many many hours at a time, this could become an issue. I haven't had any problems with my games (all three of the \"next gen\" systems look and play great on this thing), but I am not as hardcore a gamer as I used to be.Overall, this set is dynamically beautiful, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic picture that will wow you and your friends and family for years to come.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Shawn A.

I don't even feel the need to fire up the sound system for daily TV viewing any more:).The picture is outstanding. I never noticed how much stuff gets purposely blurred out in TV shows before now.  Thing like license plates, a protruding nipple, that bloody scene on ABC. It is amazing some of the stuff they blurred out in shows that I never even noticed before getting this TV.The number of connectors is satisfactory.  A network connection would be that extra nice touch.  With all the HDMI stuff coming out now days, a 3rd one of those would be handy eventually as well. The USB connection for possible updates was a huge relief to see.  I think I might even be able to play some picture from it, but I haven't given that a try yet.Overall, a very solid buy after having it almost 6 month!", "Date": "May 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "white glove means white glove !!", "Author": "Pauline M.

When I saw the deal for this plasma for $900 including white glove shipping and a free Logitech Harmony 550 remote ($75), I had to pull the trigger.Delivery service came 2 days earlier than initially estimated, but the crew from Eagle Global Logistics was 40 minutes late from their window. They unpacked it, set it up on the table I provided, and hooked up the component cables from my HD cable box. Everything looked great. I've been breaking in the TV ever since (on hour 110 of 250) to \"harden\" the phosphors, which can help mitigate image retention and burn-in.I went to the local Comcast office and switched out the old box with a new one with HDMI. Picture quality was slightly better on HDMI. HDTV is fabulous with very realistic skintones and no detectable motion blur.Next up was my Apple TV, which is wirelessly connected to a server in my office. Apple TV automatically upscales archived movies to 720p and that looked great too. DVDs upconverted via my DVD player are crisp with no artifacts.My only gripe is that I wish the speakers were more powerful than 15W. I figure this was partly a compromise for putting the TV in a slimmer package. No biggee.LCD is really dominating the market right now, especially in the 42\" space. Analysts say that the plasma makers have realized this and are focusing more on larger sizes - 50\", 60\" and above. The manufacturers still have manufacturing capacity for 42\" plasmas, so consumers may see serious price drops as these start to get phased out. That said, this deal was amazing and it may be hard to find better 6 months from now.The Logitech Harmony 550 came separately. I programmed it in about 90 minutes using the newest SW from Logitech's website. Since then I've been doing little tweaks to my liking.

It had the by far best picture and detail among its competitors and outstanding connectivity. I prefer plasma over LCD because the picture looks more natural. 720p is beyond the human eye's resolution unless you are watching this 42' TV from less than 6 foot...we watch from a 10-15 foot distance and for that purpose 1080p is truly a waste of money.I did not regret my decision. I purchased through Amazon.com, EGL called and delivered the TV at a time specified by me in less than 1 week, and unpacked and inspected the TV for me (free shipping/white glove delivery). Very convenient and I saved hundreds compared to local electronic stores.Picture and sound are excellent. HDTV is breathtaking out of the box but some tweaking of settings is necessary to get the perfect picture (easy on-screen navigation). I was concerned about the quality of standard definition, but even in wide screen mode (stretch from 4:3 to 16:9)) of standard TV, picture quality is great. Samsung's burn-in protection does the job well. I fell asleep a few times and the DVR stopped with a still-image for quite some time without any signs of burn in; there was some image retention which cleared within a minute of watching regular TV.Sound is absolutely clear and more than adequate - if you are someone who needs base to shake walls, get your separate sound system...no built in TV speaker will suffice. I have an expensive sound system connected but have rarely felt the need to use it.A minor point of criticism is that changing channels takes about two seconds and there is a message (\"searching for signal\"). Also, there is occasionally some image retention even without a still picture.Overall - I am more than satisfied with my purchase although I am quite picky if it comes to electronics.

Do NOT buy for the Picture in Picture feature. To Switch your choice of pictures sound you must pull up menu. Choose sound then input. Now the killer. SOUND has cut out on me way to many times. My older tv (Sony) never lost sound, ever and NO tv should! So it is not my $89.00 HDMI Cable. You expect to make adjustments to a TV, Color, Tint, Contrast etc. NOT to this sound problem. Defective item is being returned.
