{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible Value for this TV", "Author": "M. John \"MPJ\"", "ReviewID": "RRV0RFKBE5Q82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "if you can find it for 1/2 of the retail price like I did.Let me preface this by saying 3 years ago I purchased a Panasonic 50PZ85U Plasma (50\" plasma with 488hz subfield drive)I did a lot of research into finding a 42\" TV with at least 1080p 120hz LCD TV to be used in my moms bedroom.  My mom was using the PC input in the living room TV and just burning up the plasma surfing the web and for her purposes since she stays stagnant on 'still' screens a lot I did not want to get her a plasma I knew LCD was the best option for her.  I am extremely VALUE minded I wanted 42\" 1080P 120hz for under 400.  After doing some research I found those specs incredibly difficult to meet.  I would have to spend at least 700 to get a name brand (LG, Samsung, Panny) to meet my specs.  I discovered oddly that a lot of 60hz TV's are still being sold online at my budget (400) up to 550.  So be careful not to get a TV whose price is right, but is only 60hz.I found this TV after 7 days of looking online for endless hours.  This TV can be bought for the price of what you can find 60hz 42\" models online currently.  You just have to look.  Try a nationwide wholesale store. hint hint.Now to review this TV.  This TV is extremely easy to set up.  It even has as part of its set up a set of comparison pictures for you to pic the optimal contrast for your TV for your particular taste.  This TV has plenty of HDMI outlets, 3 if I'm not mistaken with coax and 'S' there is also a VGA PC Input.  The screen is a nice size I honestly cannot tell the difference between this and a 42\"  although I can tell a difference between 40\" and 37\" TV's.The image on this screen is beautiful.  The 240hz works wonderfully and I cannot tell that much of a difference in high speed action movie with this TV compared to my Panny.  There is no blur when I've watched basketball (NCAA tournament time) on this TV probably due to the 240hz like there is in 60hz and in some 120hz models I've seen.All in all for the price I paid for this TV this TV is an incredible steal.  To find a comparable TV I'd have to spend double, at least 1000 to get 240hz.  If your contemplating purchasing a Samsung or LG 120hz instead I caution you to not 'waste' any more money than you have to to simply get the name brand.  My analogy would be this TV is a fully loaded top of the line Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.  Buying an LG or Samsung simply for the name brand and price is like buying a LEXUS or ACURA  withCKS, CLOTH SEATS, ROLL UP WINDOWS, FM/AM Radio only, and MANUAL TRANSMISSION.  Which would you rather have?If your an analytical, value buyer, that wants the best bang for your buck then follow my advice and GO BUY THIS TV (if you can find it cheaper than the current price of 699.  Heck you can get the same TV with the internet APPS for cheaper at 649)At 240hz instead of 120hz your getting incredible performance at an unbelievable price.Lastly, if your looking for Samsung quality take solace in knowing the panel to this Philips is made by Samsung.  Now you can have your cake and eat it too!Click \"YES\" if you found my review helpful. Thanks.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "super pleased with purchase, and excellent value", "Author": "Wiseguy 945", "ReviewID": "R3MYBSLUH2R9RW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV about 1 month ago, and so far love it.  I own a Panasonic Viera th-50pz80U (480hz 1080p)that I bought 2 years ago, and my brother owns the newer g10 50 inch 600hz panasonic, and this phillips is as nice as those two Plasma TVs.  Upsides of this tv, LCD, more durable as far as moving around. Plasma tvs are still glass and need to be kept upright, never to be placed on their face.  this can be moved more.  It is brighter than the plasma TV at baseline.  Colors pop without haveing to put the  TV into a brighter mode as I have done before on my plasma. there is no burn in or streeking as with the plasmas if not taken care of. I have not had a problem with the panasonics, but on rare occasion on pause I will see a little burn in that will fade on my plasma.  I think that the speed of the TV, 240hz, has made it comparable to my plasma for everyday movies.  This has a digital motion program built in the set which can be turned off and on. For regular movies and TV, I turn it off. On animated movies, wow, i think this TV beats my plasma. The draw back with the digital motion is that it looks really choppy in movies with a lot of action, like car chases .  It does funny things with the people on the screen as well. If it is focused on a character, it almost feels as if they were standing there in the room. It looses the warmth and depth in background, and again seems choppy when the focus person or object moves, and looks really processed (like a computer straining to keep up with rate) if the background moves. Regular movies and sports, I love my Plasma TV.  This Philips 5505 model does not have Wifi built in for net flix, but the 5705 model does. This one runs a bit cheaper, and as a second nice tv for the bedroom, this works well and is a great value for the speed and size. Only  a few of the upper models from sony and LG have 240 hz LCD/LED tvs, and those models will cost you quite a bit more for a comparable TV. The Cheapest i saw the Sony was around $1100 for a 40 inch.  For LCD tvs, this one is great, and the digital motion can be turned off which is a nice feature. As a final note, my friend sprung for a samsung 46 inch 120hz model, and spent considerably more, and this toast it all around. again with the samsung as with most LED tvs, they over process the image and it looks choppy and unnatural.  That is why i like the fact I can turn on and off the Digital motion feature.  Check this TV out, great value and performance.Update- response to some questions that came up.  The Net picture are not that goodThanks for the good questions, the pictures are tough to seeThe Bezel is a glossy bezel, reflectiveThe screen is essentially flat. I note a small reflection when the tv is off, but there is no reflection when the tv is on, and i can tell you my plasma tv that is one draw back, the reflection on bright days. in looking at the other lcd/led tvs on the market, this is the same as most of them these days. My friends Samsung 46\" 650 model has an actual plastic protective cover over the LCD screen which does reflect, that was a shock. the non reflective front is one of the advantages of any LCD/LED tv over most plasmasMesurments 26 1/2 tall, 9 3/4 at base, tv 3 3/4 thick, 39 across horizonal, corner to corner at 40\" screen, almost 43 corner of bezel to corner of bezel.Finally, LCD/LED tvs run much cooler than plasma tvs, so this tv is much cooler and nicer in my room than my plasma would be.One final note. Depending upon if you want Net capability for streeming videos from the internet eg, netflixs, or blockbuster streeming vidio, the 5705 model online here at amazon is only a few dollars more. I got my tv at a warehouse retailer for less than the current price today on sale, so this model was a no brainer, and I don't really care about the net capability because various blu-ray players have that capability as well. so if you want a stand alone tv and you plan to get a blu ray player, net capapble doesn't matter. if you have limited space and watch all your movies offline, then the 5705 model would be worth the investment.hope this helps", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV especially for the $", "Author": "D.

Got it home and was absolutely blown away by this unit. I have a Panny G25 plasma which I love, but for the price I paid, this TV can't be beat. Colors are great, picture quality is on par with that of Samsung, Sony, etc. Read some stuff on some forums and found out that Samsung actually makes the panel for this TV. I would def recommend this unit to anyone looking for a tv on a budget. This unit brings the budget price but outperforms its price significantly. I wanted to give it 4.5 stars for one reason, and maybe i'm picky, but I hate the volume control. Instead of numbered volume or a slider it uses this shape that slowly fills as the volume is turned up. I don't like it because I feel its hard to read and tell where the volume actually is. That sounds really stupid to drop it a 1/2 star after i type it out, but oh well. Playing COD on PS3 is just stunning and the same w/ Blu Ray. Overall great TV, very happy, would buy again.Pros:1.

The TV was in my living room on 11/20. super fast shipment. no tax and no shipping fees too.i love the tv. its our first hdtv and the picture is crisp and clear. i had to turn off the active control as it was making the picture darker like it thinks you are watching at night time almost going to sleep so it is less bright. with the active control off, the colors pop out more and the whites are are so white. the nettv initially has vtuner and netflix only, then when you update the software, it will display twitter too but i dont like twitter so i dont use that. netflix is only those that you have on your instant Q. You cannot search from the tv. so just add the movies you want to watch on your instant q and it will be immediately displayed on your tv. Quality is awesomes. its HDTV quality.  easy to setup. really big box too for a 40 in so im sure it will be ok while on shipment. i like the controller too except that i havent really played around with it, we have comcast so we still use the comcast controller cause of the guide button which the tv controller will never have and i doubt if any other controller has it.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best HDTV for $550!", "Author": "Kai H. Chan \"7\"", "ReviewID": "ROTGGRJZ2A05H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: This HDTV is built with a Samsung 120hz panel which was the main selling point for me.  The PQ (picture quality) with HD content is beautiful and clear especially with Bluray!  With DNM, the PQ have much greater depth and clarity and can even seem 3D-ish which I am loving!  With SD content, it is as good as any other HDTV.  The built in speakers are the best that I've heard but I use my surround sound anyways.Cons: Although this HDTV is advertised at 240hz refresh rate due to Philips' 1 D (One Dimension) dimming tech which simulates 240hz, it is only displaying on a 120hz panel.  Hence IMHO, I find DNM on \"Minimum\" (120hz) yields a higher PQ compared to DNM on \"Maximum\" (240hz).  This was evident to me while watching live HD sports programming.FYI: When using this HDTV in \"PC Mode\" with a PC, you are limited to 60hz but the PQ and text are really clear in 1080P.  I would not use \"HDTV\" mode with a PC because the PQ is horrible and the text is distorted.  I use XBMC as my media UI which will blow you away if you have a massive media library!  PQ calibrations are subject to personal preference but the following are mine:Contrast - 80Brightness - 65Color - 60Tint - 0Sharpness - 3DNM - Minimum for HD, Off for SD/PC/ConsolesDynamic Contrast - OnAll other options - OffConclusion:  This is the BEST HDTV for the money!  $550 shipped!

The picture is as nice as almost any other that I've looked at. Someone here posted that Samsung makes the panel for this set and if so, this would make sense because it's as nice as the best quality Samsung sets that I've seen. The 240 Hz is a big plus watching sports. When the original signal is top quality - think football playoffs or world series broadcasts - then you definitely get  an astonishingly clear picture. I can read the technical specs just like anyone else, 1080p, 240hz, etc., but I don't really know exactly why the picture on this set is so good, it just is and I consider myself lucky to have it in my home. Nice job, Philips!I'm no video gamer, so I can't testify to its performance with an xbox or ps3, but others have and seem to love it.No one aspect of this is anything but good, most are great.One possible negative, the audio is good but not what I think it ought to be. With these lighter sets they incorporate speakers in the rear and they don't pack the same kind of ooomph. Doesn't bother me but will definitely add audio eventually, either a soundbar or surround setup.Very glad I bought this TV!", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Philips", "Author": "77 feathers", "ReviewID": "R33BTZUQ60BXXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This T.V. is FANTASTIC.

I gave it 4 stars because I am sure there is something out there that costs twice as much that may be a little better.  The picture, particularly when receiving an HD quality signal, is amazing.  Sometimes there is a little ghosting or pixel weirdness, but even then it is so far superior to our old tv that we are ecstatic.  I would say some of the reviews of 240Hz that I read about it doing something funny with background info may be true.  It looks really 3d, though, that is to say that there is a very well-defined depth of field.  It sometimes looks like \"real\" footage.  I don't know how else to phrase it.  It looks like you are there on set.  (This could be a standard phenomenon with 1080p and have nothing to do with the 240z.)  Color is great.  It is user friendly.

Some of the positives include:-A smooth image perfect for sports viewing (no motion-blur here!).  While the 240hz seems to be a bit of a gimmick (I never use that mode as it makes everything look like videotape instead of film) at least at this time, I have been very satisfied with the overall \"hz\" performance.-It connects (via HDMI) very well to my laptop and other mobile devices.  No problems in this area whatsoever.-Picture quality is excellent.  I'm not an expert in this area, to be sure, but I can't rank the picture on this Philips as any worse than other top-of-the-line options.  For the viewer who just wants clear HD programming and doesn't have to obsess over the specs, this will do just fine.About the only \"caveat\" I should give to people (though no fault of the actual TV itself) when considering this brand of TV is that it indeed is not as bright as an LED model.  I compensate for this by keeping the TV in \"game\" mode while watching movies, which provides a bit more light and thus makes things look fine.  This TV just lacks the \"vivid\" mode so common now on the LED models.Overall, though, this is a great HD television for those on a budget who don't care to obsess over picture quality or technical specs.

As others have said the picture is amazing. I also went through the quick set up for picture, however, what was a MAJOR shock for me was that you have 1 Personal picture setting.  The other settings, unless I am mistaken are 'fixed' as in you cannot tweak them.  The movie setting for me is too dark even at night, and because of this the colors are not as rich as they could be.  I've been watching my movies on the 'fixed' Game setting and during the day I use the Personal picture setting to brighten the screen.  If I had one complaint this would be it, 'fixed' picture settings.  I'm a photographer and a movie junkie and viewing is extremely important to me.Like another reviewer also said the sound leaves much to be desired.  The speakers are located in the back and my old 720p JVC has much richer sound.  I will have to splurge for the Engergy 5.1 home theatre system that they sell here at Amazon.Also on my first viewing I did notice an upper left corner white streak (light leak) this leak has not gone away.  I'm disappointed because when you watch a dark disc like The Others with low lights the streak is annoying and distracting.  The screen IS reflective.  It might be better than a plasma but it does have a lot of reflection.Other than upgrading the sound (very soon) and the light leaking left streak I'm reluctantly pleased with my purchase.  My TV did arrive with a Walmart sticker on the box and it sucks if the other reviewer is correct and they can be had for $499.

Overall it is very user friendly with a great look.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Watched two movies before it died", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R29DV2JGBRNGS0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this Phillips 40\" HDTV and could not be more let down. When I took it out of the box and mounted it on my wall and first turned it on it looked great. Then I broke out The Dark Knight and started watching it, at first it looked pretty good, but then I noticed that when action scenes got moving really fast the TV could not keep up. Blurry pixels were rampant and I was upset with this as I thought 240Hz and Phillips Pixel Precise HD feature was enough to guarantee silky smooth action. That being said, when the action was not moving too fast the picture was pretty good and color and contrast was quite satisfactory. After finishing the first movie I had to leave town for a few weeks and I turned off and unplugged the TV while I was gone. I came back last night and plugged it back in and threw on Watchmen. I experienced the same pixillation as with The Dark Knight but I figured it was as good as I was going to get for the very reasonable price I paid. I finished the movie and tried to follow it up with Avatar, and thats when the problems really started. I was five minutes into the third movie when suddenly the left half of the screen went blank. There was a popping and fizzing noise and about 3 inches of the inside left half of the screen came back but was filled with snowy, fuzzy blur. Right now my screen looks like this: entire right half clear as normal, 3 inches of left center is snowy pixels and can slightly see video being played, and the rest of the left side is 100% dead. It is not the input, I tried normal HDTV box, my Blu-ray player, and my Apple TV with identical results. Tomorrow I am putting it back in the box and digging out my receipt, not a happy camper.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "4 HDMI inputs\n240Hz Clear LCD\nPerfect Natural Motion\nPixel Precise HD\nEnergy Star 4.0", "Name": "Philips 40PFL5505D/F7 40-Inch 1080p 240 Hz LCD HDTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41egOm3tjUL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003ICXCYS"}}
