(Nice little OTA TV guide).Connected to a Comcast DVR(cable box) using a good component cable set (five leads) and the HD picture was very good!The 480i analog channels were mediocre.The new owner immediately programed the HD channels into her favorites.We recorded some of the Beijing Olympics (in HD) on the DVRand it played back beautifully! The owner was very happy.The component cable will replaced by a DVI/HDMI cable soon and the component cable set will be used with a DVDR (it has no HDMI output).Download the manual and you will be amazed at the features.Things like Lip-Sync correction! Nothing like that in my own HDTVs (1 year old).Once the Comcast DVR universal remote control was re-programmed (using the alternate method, since Vizio codes are too new), it could directly control the VU37L off-on, volume & audio mute functions.The owner was happy with the PQ, it was left in the default mode \"standard\" until another time.For OTA users (Over the Air), the Vizio remote will work great.It comes with 2 AA cells and is medium sized. Not real big and not small. It has less buttons and they are easy to read.On the right side of the VU37L is a manual set of control buttons. Right next to it is a full set of inputs for quick hookup use with a cam or game etc.All connections on the back panel are recessed and pointed down. Meaning that wall mounting will be super easy.This TV is not very heavy and is simple to install. No need to call your geek buddy. Five minutes from box to watch..Cheers,Rich", "Date": "August 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best TV", "Author": "Pamela Roberts", "ReviewID": "RVXCR18PDQAUN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have enjoyed our 32\" HD Vizio TV for approx 2 yrs. It has a great picture and was priced very reasonably when we purchased it. We are going to be purchasing a new TV for another room in our home and it will be a Vizio! The only thing I would improve is the channel controller. All the numbers and letters wore off in a short amount of time. A cable box solves this problem or a little paint.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "I got a lemon", "Author": "Stayce", "ReviewID": "R30M1IRLWFLE6O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It worked beautifully for all of one month...then the screen went black.
