The display is crisp and clear, the blacks are deep and sharp and the sound is decent.However, I was on the verge of returning this TV due to the constant pop-up ads that are displayed every time you power on the TV (large ad that floats up from the bottom of the screen and takes up 1/2 the TV's screen real estate and doesn't disappear for several seconds) and the small ad that pops up every time you adjust the volume.Panasonic has, of course, buried the option to turn off these ads deep with-in the TV's menu tree.  Here are the steps to turn off the ads.1. Press 'Menu' on the TV's remote2. Choose Setup3. Choose Display customization4. Choose Viera Connect Banner5. Choose OffIf it weren't for these ads and the frustration of having to navigate through every menu item to locate the option to disable them, I would have given the TV 5 stars.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Picture But A Sound Problem", "Author": "Jack \"Flash\"", "ReviewID": "R1K5XLOIGDLQON", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV produces an excellent picture, with saturated colors and deep blacks.  The viewing angle is more than adequate.  Video response is quick and I've noticed no judder on fast-moving scenes, such as sports.  The sound from the built-in speakers is better than on some flat screens I've heard but far from high fidelity.  It is quite clear, though, and voices are easy to understand even with the poor audio on many cable channels.The \"smart\" features of this unit are quite easy to access and use.  The menu is well laid out and you can add more apps in addition to those that come pre-installed.  Most are free but some have a nominal cost.  The web browser is fairly fast but, as others have pointed out, entering URLs is a pain with the remote.  However, you can save favorite sites so you don't have to type them in the next time.  You can also choose a home screen which will appear when the set is first turned on.There are some oddities.  For one, the remote, while well-designed, controls only the TV and certain Panasonic video players.  Many of today's TV remotes can also control a cable box, a convenient feature.  The power-on LED is red while many other TV brands use a green light.  Red is most often used to denote a problem.  There is a nearly 1/2\" tall strip of clear plastic running full-width across the bottom of the TV.  On its left side are the power LED, the receiver for the remote and this is also where an optional web camera (for Skype) would be mounted.  This strip appears to be a bit fragile so it's best to take care not to bump it.This set has a media player which can display pictures, videos and play music from, say, an iPod or a USB drive loaded with music files.  This is where I first encountered the sound problem mentioned in the title of this review.  When I played music tracks from a USB drive they sounded strange and I soon discovered that the left channel audio was coming through both speakers.  The right channel sound could not be heard at all.  This was also the case when listening to a sound bar connected to the set's digital audio output.  I then tried listening to Pandora and the result was the same.  Curiously, the sound was fine with TV stations, both over-the-air and on cable.  None of the settings on the TV's audio menu had any effect on this problem.It took some doing but I was finally able to contact Panasonic, by letter, and tell them about the problem.  They responded via email a couple of weeks later and this was the first of many back and forth emails in which they requested more details about the problem and passed them on to their engineers.  Finally, more than two months after the initial contact, they came up with a firmware update which fixed the problem.  I have no idea how many of this particular model may have this malady but if you own one of these sets you might want to check out the sound on both Pandora and via the media player to see if yours is similarly affected.  If it is you might want to contact Panasonic for the firmware update.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Quality to Price Ratio, but still under review", "Author": "Brian Vianzon", "ReviewID": "R31PZU8VJCS5YW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:-Screen Quality that rivals Samsung-Excellent App Support-Excellent Smart Phone SupportCons:-No built-in QWERTY Keyboard on the Remote Control-Terrible on-screen typing-Interrupts in Netflix Streaming-Disconnects with Smart Phones when content sharing (Photos or Video)Details:This was purchased through Costco two weeks ago for $750 ($50 Off) and it's my first HDTV. I've been fortunate to experience a 55\" Samsung Smart TV and a 60\" Sharp Aquos from my Father's setup, and I was biased to Samsung's superior screen quality. When I started my search, I read through Consumer Reports Articles, Newegg, and Amazon reviews, but ended up with this Panasonic Viera.First, I spent an hour watching content side-by-side comparing the Panasonic Viera TC-50LE64 with the Samsung 46\" Smart TV UN46F6350A ($800), and the Panasonic has the same screen quality. Second, the Apps that I wanted from the Samsung were already on the Viera (Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus, Vudu, and YouTube). Netflix Streaming has been very impressive for HD Content and surround sound on my 5.1 Logitech Z-5500. Third, the most important feature was content sharing from Smart Phones, specifically from the Samsung Galaxy SIII that my wife and I have. The SIII and Viera detected each other with ease and I have been able to view Picture Slideshows and Videos in HD.Cons Continued:Remote Control - At my work, we use 60\" Vizio E-Series TVs for System Monitoring, and Vizio was smart with integrating QWERTY on the backside of the remote control. For the Viera, each App will have different ways for on-screen input (since they are not uniform, I find this cumbersome for input). I plan to try the IOGEAR GKM681R 2.4GHz Wireless Compact Keyboard, which has been compatible with some of the older Panasonic models.Netflix - I've watched about 20 different movies and several TV shows and about 1-in-5 will buffer and then fail to load (I'll try to post pictures and video). My career as a Network/System Administrator makes my home setup very particular, so I have the Viera on the 5 GHz Band instead of 2.4 GHz due to congestion from neighboring Wi-Fi. I have a TrendNet with OpenWRT that is about 20' away going through two uninsulated walls. I regularly use inSSIDer to check for Wi-Fi Interference and I'm the only Wi-Fi on 5 GHz. Turning the TV Off/On hasn't made a difference and using 2.4 GHz produced the same results.Content Sharing - when viewing a picture or video, a special icon appears to initiate the connection to the Viera. On a few occasions, the feature would work and then lose connectivity or the icon to connect would disappear. Power cycling the TV or Wi-Fi AP, as well as reboot on the phone, wouldn't fix the issue. Eventually, the feature would just start functioning again.Possible explanations:(1) Netflix App may have a bug or Netflix is have server issues(2) The radios for the 5 GHz Band may be failing, but I'm not convinced that's the case because my Macbook Pro and SIII remain connected on 5 GHz when the issue occurs.(3) During one instance, when I had the Viera scan for Wi-Fi, it did not produce any results. Fortunately, the Wi-Fi module is exposed on the back of the TV and easy to access, so there's a possibility of a Panasonic repair to come out and replace the module or send a replacement.(4) For Content Sharing, it could be a Networking issue (need to check my Router) or a bug that could be fixed with newer firmware on the Viera or updates on the SIII.When I get time, I'm going to check with Panasonic's Support. I'll continue to monitor the Netflix and Content Sharing issues and add more feedback, but so far 1-star off for minor inconveniences.[Update August 18, 2013]I discovered that Content Sharing pictures and video on the MicroSD card occasionally has trouble being streamed to the TV. I'm not sure if this is a bug with my SIII or Panasonic. Could still be related to Network issues, but I've check my Mikrotik and used the Packet Sniffing tool. Everything seems fine there, but I have a TrendNET AP that I have to check.I tried a firmware update for the TV, but the problem with Netflix still persists, but with less frequency. In some instances, I can jump to another movie without problems, but other times I have to shutdown the App and then it resumes on restart.I added my Amazon Prime account for Amazon Instant Video App. The user interface is not as nice as the Netflix App, but I'm not sure if it differs across different TVs. I have encountered similar issues where the streaming gets interrupted. Again, it would be a Wi-Fi issue.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good but some of the options Need work", "Author": "charise", "ReviewID": "R3FK7M8GJEZ2JF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "previously i had a Panasonic TC-l42e3 television and was very happy with it.

The E60 LED was displayed next to it and I was surprised how much brighter the image is.  The picture quality seemed of equal quality to the top rated unit and my eyes didn't have to strain to see the dimmer plasma-based picture.  We tried several modes and brightness levels and the plasma just couldn't come close.After we got it home, I was simply amazed at how good the picture quality is at this price point. The smart TV with wireless features made this a plug and play device; literally, one plug goes in the wall, configure the wireless though on-screen prompts, log into Amazon Prime, and we were blown away by the opening reels of madmen and shocked at how bad Cameron's and Ed Rooney's teeth are in Ferris Bueler's Day Off...

It is crisp and clear and the color is excellent. Truly awesome. I cannot get over the vast difference from my old 42\". Even in a bright room with a lot of light I was still impressed. Maybe I shouldn't have been so surprised, knowing how far TV's have come, but I honestly wasn't expecting such a difference. I was perfectly happy with the picture on my 42\" but now I am spoiled forever.When the TV was delivered I wasn't ready to set up it, so I didn't have the delivery guy do it, but that is a very nice option when ordering this TV. My brother and I set up it up a week after I got it though and the set up was surprisingly easy. I was sure we were in for a somewhat major project, but within an hour we had it set up on it's stand, in it's place and turned on. I did not want to mount it on the wall, but of course you can do that, no wall mount is included though.As well as a great picture, the design is very nice too. I love how thin it is and the almost completely borderless edge to edge screen. For the screen size (58\") I expected it would be heavier and take up a lot more room than it actually does.I read some of the reviews stating that the sound is far inferior to the picture, but I really don't have an issue with the sound, my brother immediately said I should get a sound bar, but for me, the sound is fine. I don't like to listen to the TV really loud, no matter what I am watching so sound isn't an issue, but if I come across a sound bar for a good price somewhere I probably will give it a try. I can see if you are looking for a \"movie theater\" experience the sound probably isn't up to snuff for that kind of viewing.I had no problem setting up the apps and so far they are all very easy to use. I love, love, being able to browse the internet, watch You Tube and check emails. That part is way cooler than I thought it would be. Also being able to swipe and share pictures and videos from my phone is a really fun feature. The kids LOVE doing this.Bottom line, very impressed.

This Panny just blows us away! Our main viewing area is about 40 degrees off center and it didn't lose ANY color or clarity while viewing from this position. The screen is very matte and it's hard to even make out our bay windows behind and to the left of us even when the screen is dark. Was VERY happy to see the MLBTV app included as I easily linked my account to this tv. Full internet browser was a huge plus! I can't rave about the quality of the picture enough! The sound , when I use the eq setting of more bass and treble and low midrange is actually fairly decent. Got this for $100 off ($1,299) All in all, if you're looking for a high-quality 58'' tv with an amazing picture, don't pass this up!. You won't be disappointed.

At first I was leaning toward a 3D set, but after reading a lot of reviews and realizing how infrequently we would probably actually use the 3D features, I decided against it. That actually made the search harder, since it seems most TVs in this size (and larger) are pretty much ONLY available in 3D.Free 2-day delivery with Prime was a plus, and to my amazement it was actually at my door less than 24 hours after ordering. Unfortunately, the wall mount was shipped separately and so I had to wait another day to actually put it up, but I could play with it on the stand in the meantime.I was mainly interested in Amazon Prime Instant Videos and Netflix. Both are among the built-in apps and both work well, though the on-screen \"keyboard\" is a nuisance to use. (I may get an inexpensive wireless keyboard if I can find one; also, I just downloaded the Viera app for my Android phone, which is supposed to let me use it as a keyboard for the TV.)  We're just under 30 miles from broadcast towers, so I picked up an amplified antenna at Ace Hardware and gave that a go, too. My expectations weren't high, as the TV is in a walk-out basement (thus the antenna was basically at ground level) but it worked just fine on most of the over-the-air channels in the area. I suspect the that's going to depend on atmospheric conditions - besides, that's an antenna issue, not a TV issue.So, why *almost* 5 stars? Well, if you want to use the built-in browser for streaming video, it may be hit-or-miss. I tried nbcsports.com, and it uses Adobe Flash, which the browser doesn't have. Searching Panasonic's online help, I found a couple statements that it only supports video in HTML-5 standard, which isn't widespread yet. With HDMI inputs on the TV, and an HDMI port on my laptop PC, I can always use my laptop to receive the feed and then direct it to the TV via HDMI. That's a bit of a nuisance, though. I'm not sure it's ultimately going to make a lot of difference to me, because I really don't spend LOTS of time watching TV, and will probably use this mostly for Prime and Netflix videos, plus an occasional sporting event. (GO HAWKS!)There's nothing to say about setup - it's a no-brainer. I've only tried a couple of the built-in apps besides Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos. Accuweather is really lame. Gave the built-in games app a try (GameJam? I forget the name.) and it was pretty worthless, but again, I didn't really get it for playing games either. Haven't tried any of the downloadable apps from Viera Connect yet.So, overall, it gets about 4-3/4 stars from me. And the absence of Flash is balanced by disappointment at how much video providers are dragging their feet in getting to the HTML-5 standard, so I can't completely blame Panasonic for coming up 1/4 star short.UPDATE: July 1, 2013Watch out if you want to use Skype on this TV. There are only two or three cameras that it supports, and they're all around $100. I have a high-end webcam and was shocked to find out that I couldn't use it. Make sure you check the PDF for the Accessory Compatibility Chart. The technician on Support Chat said that the TALK-7181 works, but it's not on that chart, so I'd be cautious there.

For the price it is a good mix of functionality and quality.  That being said a few of the \"features\" are somewhat pointless and few irritating.First the irritating:  When adjusting volume or changing channels there is an advertisement displayed beneath the volume display.  It's yet another way of invading a personal interaction.  However, it is most likely a way to offset development of their \"apps\"Pointless:  Apps in a TV are something that, at least to me are mostly pointless.  With the exception of connectivity to Netflix, Amazon instant video, Hulu plus, and DLNA server connectivity the ones for a calendar, web browser, news viewer, are quite pointless as the remote doesn't come with a keyboard so using as a web browser, calendar reminders, etc is quite cumbersome and better met by existing devices (computers, cell phones).  Panasonic should invest in upgrading the HDMI control to be able to control the varied devices to be connected to the TV, not just \"Panasonic\" branded products.Good:  The TV picture quality is quite good, colors and contrast are very accurate.  There is also built in energy saving functionality which adjusts the brightness based on surrounding lighting levels.  The TV also puts off minimal heat, is quite light, and has a minimalist bezel frame (just 1/2\" all around) resulting in a good choice for hanging on a wall.When the unit is turned off there are no irritating LED's blaring across the room as with other TV's so we found it a good choice for our bedroom where we tend to watch movies prior to going to bed and like to wake up to the news.  The unit also can be programmed to turn off automatically after 4 hours of not interacting with the unit or 15 minutes of not receiving a signal.Want to use your set top box to play audio or pandora?  The TV can be set to only have the speakers active and the LED display powered off.  Connectivity is also good with wireless and wired network connections, HDMI, and component connections.The TV also has a app which allows control of the TV from a smartphone.  I use an iPhone and it's nice to be able to control the built in media player, adjust volume, or turn the set off from across the room (can't turn it on though slightly annoying)Overall:  It's a nice unit if I could give it 4.5 stars I would, but 5 stars I reserve for items I find no or very limited flaw.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV with fatal flaws", "Author": "Howard S. \"Luvthegadgets\"", "ReviewID": "R1OKSFF62KCW9H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a beautiful TV with a fantastic picture at a great price if you are planning on using it on the supplied pedestal with it's internal speakers. Otherwise, it has some silly, fatal flaws. Apparently. Panasonic's engineering department is not really using it's head! Most flat panel manufacturers are aware that these TV's are very frequently wall-mounted and also used with a soundbar in order to overcome the inherent problem of poor sound due to having to use small, flat, usually down-firing internal speakers. So, they provide side facing HDMI ports and a menu setting to disable the internal speakers.This set has 3 rear-facing HDMI ports. The only side-facing ports are USB. This means that you will have to find a 90 degree HDMI adapter (very hard to find) if you plan on mounting this set to a wall. Why would you put the rarely-used USB ports on the side?  Also, although the A/C power cord going into the set is cleverly going into an indented area on the back of the set making it completely low-profile, the plug that goes into the wall is like 2.5 inches of unbendable-ness creating a problem if you have had a power outlet installed behind where you plan on wall mounting it.With most soundbars, if you don't disable the internal TV speakers, you will have an echo caused by a time delay between the internal speakers and the soundbar. Every other manufacturer has a setting on the menu's to disable the internal speakers or just use a fixed volume setting. I called Panasonic tech support (I did get to a support person pretty quickly) and they confirmed that their 2013 TV's do not have this setting. Nor do they seem to get or care that it's a problem when using an an external soundbar. They claim that if you use the Optical Out and have it plugged into an external sound device, it will automatically disable the internal speakers but it ain't so. They suggested muting the TV, but then of course, it will say 'MUTE' on the screen while you are watching your beautiful LED TV picture; not a very elegant solution and a ridiculous suggestion! My even less elegant solution was to put duct tape over the TV's speakers which helps some. I could set the TV volume to zero and then change the TV setup on the cable companies remote to use some other brand so it won't change the TV volume but then I won't be able to turn the Pana TV on/off with that remote.Think Panasonic!I used the Vivid picture setting with the following changes:Backlight 65, Contrast 75, Brightness -5 (Bedroom -10), Color 65, Tint 0, Sharpness 50", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good so far", "Author": "Some Dude", "ReviewID": "R3V972O2BM9E59", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received my TV on July 3rd, 2013, so I'll be updating this review as I become accustomed to it.I ordered the 42\" TV on Friday and received it on Wednesday using the standard Super Saver shipping.  Upon removing it from the box I was amazed with how thin the TV was.  It's also very dense, so it's not the easiest thing to move around, especially if you are trying not to touch the screen with your greasy hands.  On the bottom on the TV is clear plastic, and moving the unit around (prior to stand) means putting a lot of pressure on that plastic so I kept thinking it might break (I'm paranoid when it comes to new electronics).Attaching the stand may be a small challenge for some.  You can either 1) pick the TV up and slide it down into the stand, or 2) find a soft surface to lay the TV face-down on, then placing the stand on the bottom (as another buyer suggested).  Method 1 takes a little bit of strength.  Once you got the stand on and put the screws in, the TV is more easier to move around.I'm pretty impressed with the picture quality so far.  The settings will need some tweaking though.  The first thing I found that improves the picture a lot was turning the C.A.T.S. setting to Off.  What the setting does is adjust the TV's brightness to match that of the room's.  I prefer to have it bright all the time.If you haven't used a \"SMART\" TV before, it's easy to be overwhelmed by all the graphics that appear all over the screen, especially after setup.  It's going to take a while to get the know all the features.At this time, no software update was available for the TV.Update 7/7/13: Since I bought the TV mostly for gaming, I was glad to see there's a \"game mode\" which reduces lag.  You won't see the option on the settings menu unless you are using one of the inputs on the back (like HDMI).  Basically, game mode shuts off all the extra processes that would delay an image (like the blur reducing settings) which is a good thing.  Also, I put in a Blu-ray and the picture quality looked spectacular compared to my 2005 720p Bravia.  If you are watching a Blu-ray on your PS3, you'll probably want to turn game mode back off.  It'll still look good either way.  Glad to have the TV.Update 8/24/13:I've been enjoying the TV a lot.  Picture quality is great, especially if you learn how to utilize the different settings.  If you are gaming, make sure you use \"game mode\" to prevent controller delays.  This mode doesn't show up as an option unless you are using one on the HDMI or component or composite inputs.

I've had this 50\" LED model for about a month now, and I am very happy with the picture and sound quality.  I really love the ultra-thin bezel.  It means the TV fits in a smaller space (actually a space not much bigger than where my 42\" sat) while still maintaining a huge 50\" picture.SCREEN & PICTURE:The screen has a semi-gloss finish.  I wasn't sure how I would like this because I was used to a matte finish on my old TV.  I have windows at ninety degrees to my couch (and TV) so I was concerned about glare.  As it turns out the semi-gloss screen on the 50\" model does not reflect the window glare as I had feared.  Happy about that. I didn't do much tweaking to the default picture settings except for a little contrast, brightness, and temperature changes to complement the lighting of my room.  I found the default settings were good for me.SOUND:I'm not an audiophile, so the TV speakers sound fine to me.  I would eventually like to attach this TV to a sound bar for enhanced features, but for the moment I find the built-in speakers do a great job.  I do not use the Surround Sound feature.APPS:One thing that drew me to this model was the built-in apps, particularly Amazon Prime.  I was familiar with using the Amazon Prime app with my other devices (game console, computer, tablet), so I was a little disappointed to discover that the Amazon Prime app on this TV does not include access to My Watchlist.  It's really a very basic app that I feel could be improved. Likewise, the YouTube app.  It allows sign in to access my subscribed channels, but to do this, the TV app supplies a code that I must enter via my computer.  This wouldn't be too bad if it retained my sign in settings, but I must get this code from the TV and sign in via my computer EVERY TIME I run the app.  Honestly, it's more trouble than it's worth. The VuDu app works well with my VuDu/Ultraviolet account.  The web browser is basic and lacks Flash capabilities, so it won't work with various movie pages that rely on the Flash player.  I don't use Netflix or Hulu so no comment on them.HOME PAGE:I wasn't sure I'd like having a TV with a home page, but turns out I was wrong!  Love this feature.  I love being able to customize it to show my most used apps.  I also love being able to have more than one Home page.  It's very easy to set up and use, although I recommend turning off the \"Viera Connect Banner\" advertisements via the settings page to prevent seeing ads when using the remote.CONNECTIONS & PORTS:3 x HDMI2 x USB1 x Component input (red, blue, green)1 x coax input (cable)1 x RCA audio output (red, white)1 x Digital audio output1 x Ethernet portBuilt-in Wi-FiI like that all these connectors are on a back panel, not \"up under a lip\" as I have seen on other TVs.  This makes all the connections easily accessible.  I can even reach over the top of the TV to access them without having to swivel the base around.I teamed this TV with a Logitech Wireless Combo MK270 with Keyboard and Mouse (920-004536) which connects via USB.  This allows better couch internet navigation with a keyboard and mouse.OVERALL:This 50\" LED TV from Panasonic more than meets my needs and expectations.  Could not be happier.

If you have a long narrow room, and sat off no more than 20 degrees,you would be fine. The edge lighting produces more subdued colors and overly lit edges. And finally,no bluetooth.

The most influential being the CNET review, which basically said this is the best 42\" inch TV available and that for the price there is no better offering of picture and functionality.  I fully agree. However, there are some issues that look to be widespread.Pros:  Amazing picture, didn't have an issue with viewing at angles.  Picture was a bit tough to watch in a bright room, but no more so than every other LED. Lots of inputs, lots of options for tech savvy people.Cons: TV literally sits crooked on the stand. There is no way to adjust it. On the left side of the tv all the inputs are housed and I think it's due to this that the TV weighs more. I measured it, tried adjusting screws, sat it on different flat surfaces with the same result. This may not bother some people, but I couldn't get past it.Secondly, the sound did not sync with the picture. I tried direct connection, receiver, new HDMI cords, other TVs using the same cords and nothing helped. Once again, it's only off by less than a second and some people may not have an issue with this. For me, it was a deal breaker.I spent over an hour with Panasonic troubleshooters and ultimately, they said to take it in to a local technician.  They don't come to your house if its a 42\".  I decided to exchange it for the same TV with Amazon to see if I received a defective unit.  I had the same issues with the second unit and have returned it as well.Overall, I love the picture, love the tech options, but can't get over the cons.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good value", "Author": "ctrlaltdel", "ReviewID": "R3JJJWORCJ2AQ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had spent a lot of time looking for the right TV for my living room, and when I saw the promotional credit on this TV I had to jump on it. I couldn't choose between LED and plasma so I also picked up an shelf model P50UT50 (very highly rated by experts) for comparison from my local Sears.I found that each set had it's pros and cons. After getting both sets calibrated, I hooked them both to the same source and played Avatar on Blu Ray. To me, this LED set had more vivid and enjoyable colors. The plasma's colors are more \"real\" and the biggest noticeable difference is how much LED sets squash blacks. You can see every detail of things like black hair, even in dark scenes on a plasma. The LED shows this as all pitch black, unless you turn up the brightness to the point where nothing is black anymore. But most of those concerns are nitpicky for the average buyer. What mattered most to me was 1. the plasma was very heavy by comparison and I'm in college and still moving around a lot and 2. The LED worked way better in light. Basically any amount of light in the room ruins the picture of a low-end plasma and 3. The LED was $200 cheaper brand new than the plasma for a shelf model. The slightly better picture quality on the plasma wasn't worth it.Overall I'm quite pleased with this purchase. I don't have any use for the internet apps because I have a computer and an XBOX hooked to the TV that work better for those things, but there seems to be a lot of apps. The design is really minimal and appealing. The picture is very good. The 120Hz refresh rate and motion smoothing works well. Some people like it, others don't. Personally, it depends on the source material for me. I flip it on or off depending on what I'm watching.Long story short - I don't think you will find a better value for an LED at this price ($629 with $100 credit).Note: I calibrated with the settings here: [...]I ended up at a higher brightness level, but that really depends on viewing conditions and personal preference. Just by looking at this page you can tell the number of tweakable settings is outrageous.

I chose the 10-3 window, and at about 2:30, the truck driver, George, called to say he was on his way. George carried the TV box around the back of our house and into the door of our walk-out basement. He offered to unbox and set it up, but I said no thanks, my husband and I will take care of it. Thanks CEVA and George for a smooth, easy delivery experience.Unboxing: Very easy, as long as you have a helper to help lift out the TV. Unboxing instructions are printed right on the box. You'll need a phillips screwdriver to bolt the included stand together and mount the TV; all bolts are included. The TV weighs about 90 pounds, in case you have to buy furniture or a wall mount for it.Setup: Still smooth and simple! Once your TV is plugged in and whatever boxes you have are plugged into the TV (we have an HD cable box, Xbox 360 and Wii), insert included batteries into the remote, switch it on and the TV walks you right through the setup. After connecting to your Wifi, a brief tutorial shows off the different \"home screens\" and how you can customize them.If you have an iOS device (I have an ipod touch) or Android device, go download the Viera remote app that lets you use your device as a keyboard (really beats pointing and clicking!), remote, or best of all, Swipe and Share.

My husband watches a lot of sports and the graphics and scores look very sharp.- Streaming video streams very well. I've watched YouTube and Dailymotion videos with no problems.- Remote is easy to use with big buttons and well-marked numbers.- The Viera apps are fun to use. You can preview them online (do a search for Viera apps) although you have to download them through the TV. They have YouTube, Hulu Plus, Dailymotion, Ustream, various weather and news apps, and add new ones all the time. With the YouTube app, you can even search for videos on your handheld device and then \"send\" them to the TV.- LOVE Swipe and Share! Now I can take family videos and photos with my ipod and easily show them on the TV with just a flick. The same can be done with web pages, using a browser within the Viera app.- The TV itself looks very classy, with a narrow black bezel and clear lower bezel with \"Panasonic\" in small type (not an enormous logo).What I don't like so much (all very minor):- There's only one r/g/b input, so we had to choose between the Wii or the DVD player (Wii won out) and only 3 HDMI inputs. There are a couple of USB inputs on the side, but harder to access and not as well marked as on our LG TV.- You can only register a Viera account and buy/download apps through the TV itself, not through their web page which would be much more convenient.- Password or PIN protection for customized home screens would be nice; kids like to play around with that sort of thing!- The browser is pretty useless; it doesn't support Flash and keeps crashing.I'll probably update this review, but in our first month, we love this TV and it bridges TV and internet very well.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good picture, one HDMI port inoperative upon arrival", "Author": "Joel Stanley", "ReviewID": "R2JK73F9B124QE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First- other reviews praising the picture and cursing sound quality are accurate.

Our connection speed tests consistently a 10 Mb/s on computers and iPad, while this TV shows 4 Mb/s as its connection speed. I called customer service and was told that this is normal with this TV if your WiFi router is more than a few feet from the TV -- he said around 7 feet or so. Like many homes ours is not that close to the TV - maybe 20 feet from it. The rep said that the WiFi receiver in this TV is \"different\" than a computer, iPad of other devices -- I guess he meant not very good. He suggested buying a WiFi repeater and using that to help the TV. Luckily we have an Apple Airport Express near the TV, so when I connected the TV to it via an ethernet cable Amazon streamed just fine.The TV picture quality is excellent and I still think it is a bargain at the current ($700) price, but I think potential buyers need to be aware of that this limitation.

I got tired of having a HTPC and was going to fancy the idea of selling it to help fund for a nice new Smart TV. I searched from 46 inch TV's to 50 inch TV's to even some budget 55 inch TV's then from Plasma to LCD. Every time I kept coming back to the L50E60. After sleepless nights and constant babbling with Gollum I finally decided to bite the bullet and take the plunge. I'm glad I did.My last family TV was a TCL 40 inch from 2011. It is a whole new world with the Panasonic, not that the TCL was a bad picture by any means. Very beautiful picture, though I did notice some uniform lighting issues but if you sit at the proper distance you can't tell unless you're eyeballing it. I absolutely LOVE hitting the power button and boom I have an image. This was not the case with my TCL, it takes awhile to warm up before I get a picture.Fairly impressed with the menu and apps. This is was something that was a worry for me, no one likes to navigate a slow and clunky menu. They are a step slower than my HTPC was obviously but my HTPC isn't a beautiful display either. So having one less and for what it is expensive device hanging around is a bonus.Now I did have a few issues initially.When setting up the networking side of things,  I tried to connect to my 5ghz band on the Asus N56U router.. it killed my network. I'm not entirely sure what happened but it took me changing the routers DNS to get my network back and running. I was able to connect into the 2.4ghz just fine after I was up and running again. However this lead to another issue. I could not download or update new APPS via wireless, yet I could watch Netflix HD flawlessly. I connected the Ethernet to the TV, turned the TV on and off, the apps updated/installed. Again i'm unsure as to why that is happening. For me it isn't an issue as my router sits under my TV, however for someone else it could be a problem.These aren't crucial gripes but if you skip setting the time/date up and forget about it.. well it leads to app confusion. If you haven't set your time, Youtube will not doing anything. It will sit at a white blank screen until you go back to your home page. The same goes for hulu, luckily hulu told me to check and make sure my time and date were set.Another gripe, I don't like the stand at all. It feels a little cheap and I don't like how the TV is a bit wobbly if you even brush it. Also it would have been nice if it had some turning range.I haven't had the TV long and I rarely write reviews so I figured I'd do it now before I forget. I feel the TV deserves a review it has been impressive. I'm unsure if there is a solution to the WiFi issue or it is isolated to certain setups. However if I didn't have the option of Ethernet, it is likely I would have given this a 3 star review out of pure frustration assuming I got the issue fixed.Side note - the remote 2 app, is only so so, it works for keyboard work but that is about all I will ever use it for.Update - 10/2/13Had the TV for over a month now, I'm still overall pleased with the display. I do have some gripes. I lowered my 5 star to a 4 star, as a 5 star should be reserved for a flawless display. Still for the price I had paid, it was well worth the money.The sound does not project well, which is to be somewhat expected in such a thin model. However there is a bass option, DO NOT USE IT. You'll risk blowing your speakers inside the TV. Overall the sound is adequate when placed against a solid wall.There is also some APP lag that I'm not to pleased about. It has gradually worsened over time, however there was an update which seems to have cleared it up a bit. I had a few issues with Netflix, I would select a show and it would load then switch to the Cable TV. I had to power the TV off and back on for it to work properly. I don't know what the culprit was, but it seems to have subsided since.Still, enjoying my display.Update - 10/21/13The app lag has gotten considerably worse. If I run streaming APPs for an extended period of time I have to power off the TV for 5-10 minutes otherwise they become unusable.

At the store, I looked up Amazon reviews on my phone, but there were only 1 or 2 at the time (early May '13). This was my 2nd ever HDTV purchase (the first being an excellent Samsung 46\" LCD in January 2008, for the Super Bowl when the Giants stopped the Pats perfect season). So I took a leap of faith. We do that with electronics now - how blessed we are in the 21st century!Looking over all of the reviews for this TV today (late July '13), and having bought a few other TVs for the new home since then, I think the reviews here are accurate. The difficulty of choosing a TV is absurd now. When I think that my parents probably lost their eyesight watching a twenty something inch low def TV a long distance from their sofa, I feel guilty studying ratios of room size to TV dimension, let alone looking for streaming apps or 3D.That said, I shop for a TV with all these crazy criteria in mind that you do. I realize now from looking at a thousand Amazon reviews that people look for very different things in a TV.  But for me, here is what I can say about this model:1. Aesthetically, for a wall mount TV, this is perfect - as narrow, small, and sleek of a footprint as you could ask for.2. For wall mounting, it is a bit challenging that most of the inputs are rear facing, rather than side or bottom. But this just adds to the effort of mounting; you forget about it once done.3. Like many other reviews say, get rid of the default video processing that makes all of the motion look stylized and sort of fake 3D. Once done, the picture is great.4. If you really want deep blacks, get a Panasonic Plasma. I'm an LCD/LED person, and this is as good of a picture as I think you can get with an LED without spending a lot more.5. I don't know or care about the Smart functionality or built-in Apps, since I use a Roku therefore don't need them.6. For a TV at this size and price, the built-in sound is irrelevant - you will be using a sound bar or home theater for audio.7. However, it is *inexcusable* that Panasonic does not have a way to disable the TV speakers when using a sound bar. For Verizon FiOS, I came up with a workaround, but it took some time to figure out. Program the FiOS remote volume button to control the DVR, not the TV. Then in FiOS settings, set the volume control to \"Fixed\". Then program the sound bar (Klipsch in my case) to respond to the FiOS remote. Not sure if this would work with a different sound bar model, but this setup works great with the Klipsch SB3 (which is a killer sound bar!)If your TV criteria match mine, you should be happy with this TV (after you are done with the hassle of mounting, setup, and remote control programming).", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Nice Image with A lot of Options for Calibration", "Author": "Raymond R. Jackson", "ReviewID": "R1JNRLD99F32TM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually bought this TV to replace a Panasonic LCD projector that stopped working.  Going from a 100 inch projected image to a 58 inch seems like a huge step down but this TV does things my projector did not. The big advantage between a flat screen and a budget(sub $2,000)projector is black level.  My projector never did black level near as good as my 50 inch Panasonic plamsa or this LED TV. Black level, and the abilitiy to do it well, is the big difference between budget and higher priced displays. With my projected image black looked more gray and the sharpness and clarity were not as clean as they are with this TV.So even though this might be half the size of my prior TV the black level, clarity, and sharpness of the image make-up a lot for image size.  I actually find myself more drawn to watching the images on this TV then with the larger screen. The black level on this set is as good as my plasma which is saying a lot considering this has always been plasma's big win over LCD LED TV's like this one.If you are someone who enjoys doing self calibration of your TV's settings there are a ton of options here to adjust.  There is \"Pro\" settings menu that allows you to do a lot of tinkering with a multitude of options. I am not sure I would recommend this to someone who does not know what they are doing but it is nice to know it is there if you ever want to do it.There is one negative that I encountered worth mentioning for others who may have the problem. When I played a Directv program on ABC that was shot at a frame rate of 24 frames per second I noticed an artifact called judder. 24 frames is the standard frame rate for shows shot with film or digital cinema cameras. This includes most TV shows and all feature films.  Because TV's native frame rate is 30 there is a process called 3:2 pulldown that converts film frame rate images to 30.  When pulldown is not performed you encounter judder issues  This is basically choppy looking video that is most noticeable during quick camera movement like pans. The problem is the pulldown feature does not work well on progressive resolution signals such as 720p. I fixed this by setting my Directv receiver to not output 720p so all content in HD is displayed as 1080i or 1080p. By having the interlace setting the ABC shows now work fine without judder. When you play a 1080P sources at 24 frames you may notice the same issues but this is easily fixed by selecting \"1080p Pixel Direct\" in the Advanced Picture Settings. This accepts the original 24p image from a 1080p source with no 3:2 pulldown needed, the best way to watch a show.  This works really well with Blu-Ray movies and streaming services that do 1080p resolution.I am a film purist who does not like the 120 hz motion smoothing option when watching movies.  The good news is that you can turn this feature off and if you select the picture setting called \"Cinema\" it is off by default.  If you are watching sports, documentary, or reality shows leave it on as it does improve the picture clarify on fast moving images.  Films and TV shows shot at 24 frames a second were not meant to be smoothed out this way though and it looks very unnatural and \"soap opera\" like to me.  This is totally a preference thing but something worth stating for people who are film purists like me.Beyond these two things easily fixed, I really love this TV and the image quality it gives.  Panasonic in my opinion makes some of the best looking TV's with better black levels then most other brands.  Samsung is the only other TV I would consider besides Panasonic.  There are cheaper TV's and more expensive ones to choose from. This TV sits between, giving outstanding image quality that is slightly below the thousands of dollar elite models but much better then then the budget brands.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "VERY NICE Picture With SmartTV", "Author": "IndianFoodCritic", "ReviewID": "R24L1Z7F7C4MHL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV because of 2 main reasons:1.

PS3 games look incredible with detail as far as you can see in-game. Smooth motion was granted when the 120hz kicked on, and everything flows really well, with no perceivable judder.

I can connect an external amp with speakers and/or headphones with this \"lash up.\" Many TVs are showing up these days without Line Outs or headphone jacks. What's with this?Anyway, expect a barely adequate shipping container and hope that the carriers heed the box warnings. Mine survived fine and obviously many others. The stand does not tilt or swivel but this TV is very light for a 50in and even fits exactly where the 47 lived previously. A marvel, huh!? The picture is excellent for a LED/LCD and provides inky blacks you'll love. It's also a \"Smart TV\" meaning you'll be able to connect it to the Internet via a wireless link or wired ethernet. Various streaming content is made available if you're into that sort of thing. A great point here is that this TV is rated capable of a true 120Hz refresh rate. Not all truly are. While the ad states that the screen has a matte finish, I'd have to say ...Not so much. My 2006 vintage LG's matte screen was almost inky dark even in a bright room with sun or lamps on. This TV is quite shiny  for a matte finish, and I can see myself across the room or the UPS guy through the drapes. I guess if it's not a mirror, then it is called \"matte.\" Keep this in mind when you choose placement options and \"the campers camping will be happy!\" Popcorn time!Let's wrap up saying that there are better TVs to be had but for under 800 USD, nope.

Second, although it was very easy to set up, the homepages (except for the full screen one) are super busy. Too much going on. Third, I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to type in info (when trying to set up Netflix).

You can get rid of the ads in the settings menu, but until I figured that out, I was really annoyed that I got beer ads every time I adjusted the volume.

TRUE NATIVE 120HZ panel with 240 BLB capability- be wary that certain manufacturers have fake refresh rate and I mean false advertise and sometimes they do not even advertise the refresh rate. I can confirm that this model is truely 120HZ. so you can enjoy a much smoothermovement/motion when watching. if you see some skips or don't see where to ball goes in tennis, basketball, and puck in hockey, then it is pretty much a 60hz TV. the only sure thing that the TV is more than 60HZ is a Panasonic Plasma.gamers would surely appreciate the responsiveness and smooth play.2. COLOR ACCURACY is fantastic (when properly calibrated)- I find the early presets before the latest firmware update to be either weak or oversaturated. the new firmware update of the TV shows a more acceptable result but I would recommend on following LCDBUYINGGUIDES's advanced settings toget the best results. it can be quite a task with all the adjustments but it's all worth it. you can still tweak them according to your own taste.3. BLACK LEVEL is fantastic- although this isn't a Plasma tv, the quality of blackness is great and pretty much as close as it gets to the black level quality of a plasma. such blackness can be attributed for Panasonic using a TN panel on this tv rather than anIPS panel.4. Contrast Level is amazing- again, can be attributed to the use of a TN panel. the details in the shadow and background really shows a lot that are often crushed by other tv's. if you like and appreciate seeing what lies behind those dark black/grey areas, thistv will show it all and love it. although you have to choose the setting whether to have a much dark, gloomy ambience of a scene when watching a movie versus seeing what lies beneath that darkness. it's a BLACK VS CONTRAST kind ofsetting and dependent on what you are watching and what result you want to see. (customizable)5. APPS & DISPLAY options- I find the Home Screen feature a fresh innovation. I appreciate the way you can actually see the active or favorite apps on the side of the screen while the display shrinks to a 32\" display which improves the perceived sharpness dueto the pixels being concentrated on a smaller view display. I find this very nice especially if the full screen use of 50\" or more becomes too distracting for normal or everyday simple viewing. I can mostly appreciate the fullscreenwhen viewing movies and playing games. the apps are updated and are much improved compared to their earlier iterations. you can practically connect to whatever program there is available that you want to use or popular.6. Processing and Connectivity including CONS- I find the processing of the TV to be very good and the connectivity as well is great. although it is not the best, it is very much competent for most use. the controls and input response can sometimes be laggy. it can be an annoyanceof sorts but not a total deal-breaker. people might experience some drop on quality of the picture and the connection, but this has to do more with the signal strength of the broadcast and amount of info/data streaming if you are watching HD channels and movies, especiallywith media streaming providers. so make sure your ISP and media providers gives the best service or atleast offer you with nothing less than 20Mbps of streaming data.7. Controls and UI- the remote control is very simple and easy to understand and user-friendly. I have no problem adjusting to the controls in no time. the dedicate buttons are pretty much written and a simple button can quickly lead you to the APPS,NETFLIX and HOMESCREEN instantaneously.8. Brightness and viewing angle and potential CONS due to trade-off.- the tv is very bright and found the viewing angle very good although the colors can become washed out, less saturated and shifted when viewed on extreme angles.9. TN Panel- which means higher contrast, higher black levels, faster response time and better energy efficiency.10. Picture Quality- amazing detail and resolution and very sharp. running at 1080p/24p shows a cinematic feel when watching a movie. there is no sign of flickering caused by running at such frame rate.CONS:1. SPEAKER SOUNDS- simply terrible but expected. eversince the TV's became much more thinner, there is no way you would get a good sound like the old tv's do which are loaded with heavy and bigger speakers. you cannot expect a set of extremely thinslim/miniature speakers with only 10 watts of power to sound like a home theatre. it is pretty much given that any thin modern tv should be paired with a competent soundbar. or if you wish to have that cinematic ambience, a goodreceiver (HK,ONKYO) with a set of midrange 5.1/7.1 sound system (JBL,KLIPSCH, Boston A, Polk, etc...) would make the tv an ideal personal home theatre. I would really recommend a nice sound system to go along with a big screen tv,otherwise it would just be pointless.2. Color reproduction and brightness- while the color fidelity is amazing, the color reproduction is just shy of excellent as I feel that colors could have been better. colors could have been richer and more vibrant which could have been pleasing to see in colorful movieswith varying intensity of color details. while colors do pop and give you that 3D feel, there are a few times that the colors felt just a little dull/weak but most often they are just perfectly accurately represented rather thanoversaturated. the increased brightness of the display does look to be one of the culprit that produce some washed elements which makes the  color reproduction less than perfect. another one is a shallower color gamut.3. NON-IPS Panel- this is one factor that could have spelled the difference of attaining perfect or better color reproduction. however, I believe that Panasonic have to make a certain trade-off and have to choose between color reproduction of the IPSpanel versus better contrast, black levels, energy efficiency and faster response when using TN panels. this would also mean that it will not have the same viewing angle advantage of IPS-Panels possess of maintaining color uniformity and visual capacity at awkward or sharp angles.4. Gamma level- I felt that the gamma level is just too strong as it shows the pictures to be too bright and washed-out for certain scenes. although such brightness can be adjusted, I would have preferred it to be more consistent and need no furthertweaking. the immediate solution is to choose the certain presets and adjust according to your level of preference.5. Black and Color Micro-Contrast- despite having fantastic blacks, I feel that the blacks could still have been better. the Color Contrast could have been great if the color gamut was much wider even if an IPS wasn't applied. but then I'm very spoiled by the overallpicture quality of Panasonic Plasmas.6. NO Bluetooth support- not a big deal dealbreaker, however some people might find it convenient or necessary to have especially if they are using a Bluetooth devices for scrolling and input functions. especially if using the remote is tedious when typingsome characters in. although I have heard that you could download an app where you could use your smartphone or tablet devices as input devices. this I have yet to try.7. APPS- some apps may not be available on the tv due to not being supported or exclusivity with other tv manufacturers. however, an alternative would be either to use the apps present on your gaming consoles or blu-ray players which are notavailable on your tv.8. compatibility issues and unwanted results- I find that certain picture configurations made on the tv and on your blu-ray device shows some adverse with picture quality. such settings do overlap or override the other. the worse of which is sharpening artifacts and sometimes amuch lower resolution capability on the device. this maybe due to each unit having a unique processing of it's own, limited capability and unsupported.-some similar apps on each device may also different results. sometimes worse and sometimes better. I find the Wii U's Netflix picture to be enhanced and much better than the Netflix on the TV and find that the Netflix on the Bluray tobe the worst. having said that, the Netflix on the tv itself is already excellent and runs perfectly well possibly in part with a newer and much stronger processor. so you are good with the tv'snetflix app.9. SD Broadcast upconversion-there is just little that the tv could do with a 480p broadcast. while the quality does improve, it cannot magically make a lower broadcast turn into a magnificent HD picture especially on a 1080p 50\" inch and above screen. HDTV's are meant for HD broadcast. so HD channels are recommended if you want quality or want to use the tv to it's potential. however, since SD/480p contents look less ideal or poor on a fullscreen, I find them to have quite good or even very good sharpness when reduced to a mere 32\" inch display when viewed in your homescreen. this has with the pixels of the limited SD broadcast picture being concentrated within a 32\" area rather than spread out which loses a lot of definition. at such smaller space, the picture on some of the SD channels appear close to 720p quality which is good enough for watching for those who have basic cable.10. not a PLASMA- I'm spoiled by the fact that Plasma will always be my favorite and will always have a bias for it. as the saying goes \"Once you go black, you can never go back\". personally, PLASMA is the very definition of Picture Quality and Picture Motion Performance. but then again, the uncertainty with Plasma nowadays is kind of troubling. LED-LCD's have now become the preferred choice and for very good reasons. LED-LCD's are great as far as they are in their category.***SUMMARY:I must say that the E60 is not better than my preferred TV technology of choice which is the PLASMA, but I feel that it is different. it has certain advantages that the PLASMA doesn't have or atleast that the E60 possesses such asexcellent grey shadow details and much better grey contrast or simply have a much wider grey spectrum. but I think the biggest difference of the E60 has is with regards to power saving, heat emission, longevity, weight, thinness. the LED-LCDs are the preferred technology of choice nowadays due to practicalreasons.is it an excellent buy? definitely, even for a 2013 past model.  the truth is, unless you are really going high-end or getting a 4k/8k tv in 2014, there is no real difference as far as midrange and entry level tv's go compared to last year's model. the only difference  between 2013 and 2014 models is the apps and connectivity user interface and presentation and the tv's are a bit more lighter than their predecessors. that's it.  picture qualities are pretty much the same so you are better off saving money and getting a bigger tv from 2013 than to buy a new smaller 2014 tv that pretty much is identical.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Got lucky", "Author": "M.

I thought the picture was a small improvement over the Sony until I went to HULU and got true HD input.  Wow - what a difference.Caution: 1)  I was surprised how much of a difference in viewing angle there is between LED and the old projection systems.  At first I didn't think much of the Panasonic's picture, but when I turned it so I was viewing at less of an angle I found out that all those \"washed out\" colors were really vivid.  2)  You really do need to calibrate the picture.  I followed the calibrations from CNET and they made a big difference.ONE BIG COMPLAINT - I have not found a QWERTY remote or keyboard that works with this TV.  It is very cumbersome to use the \"smart\" features without one.  I contacted Panasonic and their only suggestion was to download their app to my smart phone or tablet - but I don't own either and don't think I should have to buy them to get keyboard functionality.  The phone would add $$$ to my monthly cell service.  The Panasonic remote with QWERTY does not work with this model - at least that is what their support told me.

You get a pretty awesome picture quality for what you pay for.

Full disclosure: I would've preferred a plasma but due to a massive window being in the same room as the TV I decided to go for LED. I feel that the 120Hz just doesn't cut it and there still seems to be some motion blur and the blacks just seem too gray to me. Sometimes you'll get a great black quality and others it's kind of gray and pixelated (which may be due the media source or streaming quality) but just figured it helpful to mention.The TV menu/smart TV aspect is pretty standard.

Banner issue-  I have yet to see the banner, I didn't see it upon start up and turned it off in the setting and that is it.2. Poor sound-  Although granted, out of the box the sound is poor, but with a little tweeking of the sound adjustments, including turning on the surrond sound,  it is not bad at all.  Consider though, my set is sitting on a stand rather than on the wall, that could make a difference.3.  I have seen some comments about a dead hdmi connector-  I think this is just mistaken.  The tv senses when a device is connected to it , and thus may seem dead when really it is only not getting some signal from the device.4.  I see some complaints about not being able to turn off the internal speakers or the fact that the internal speakers aren't cut off immediately by plugging in the optical connection.  This is completely bogus, in fact Panasonic was smart about this.  For some of us who connect to an analog amplifier through a converter, we appreciate the fact that the speakers remain on and we use the amplifier only when playing some music and movies.  By the way the complaint about the mute button staying on has apparently been rectified because it now goes off within a short time.5. wi-fi dropping off issues.  I have hi speed and my router is approximately 25 ft. from my set.  I have had no drop off issues at all and am absolutely loving the Pandora app with or with the internal speakers.  Love the fact that you can turn off the screen and enjoy hours of music without it on using minimal energy. Cudos to Panasonic6.If I were to complain about anything, it would be the short power cord to this unit.  Really, give it another 3 or 4 feet.7. Some people complain about the \"on light\" being on rather than off while the unit is operating.  Panasonic rightly designed it that way because of the ability to turn off the screen and still have it function while using the apps.I calibrated the tv using Mr. Wiley's settings and CNets guidance.  I personally found Mr. Wileys a slightly better picture except for keeping the Al  setting on instead of off.

I also like that when turning off the TV, it turns back on instantly since the Samsung, Vizio, and Sharp had a 15-20 second delay.

We did notice with the new TV setting it gets a stronger signal than our Blu-Ray player so we plan to change the Blu-Ray player setting. Panasonic recommends having computers on a different band so we will leave them on the 2.4GHz band and it didn't affect the streaming. I was thinking I would need to buy a wireless extender though so far the streaming is good. It was faster when we connected with an Ethernet cable temporarily though our wireless router is in the office about 20 feet away with 3 walls in between and we can still stream fine with wireless (4 bars on HD).Regarding the picture, I like the Vivid setting, and I turned off auto motion setting.

The contrast ratio and dynamic range is key to the superior picture performance. I have Sony CRT, Sony LCD and Samsung DLP TVs as well and this outperforms them all. Connecting to the internet via WiFi was simple and works well. The color accuracy and black pedestal is better than DLP and much better than plasma. Blu-Ray movies overcome the camera filters to rival live national new feeds for clarity. I say 'eerily' because I'm not used to the near 3D accuracy that CRT comb filters struggled to match.

Matte screen (relatively, anyway). Good motion performance. 1080p/24 cadence compatibility. Low input lag for gaming. Price. Accurate colors. Good black levels.I began my search looking at Plasma sets, desiring the full dynamic resolution that plasma sets deliver beautifully.  The S60 plasma had great input lag, but couldn't handle theatrical cadence.  Plus, the screen was glossy like a mirror.  The ST60, the highest rated TV ever, has high amounts of input lag. The VT was out of my price range. You get the idea.  Compromises had to be made since there wasn't a set that met all of the areas that I'm concerned with. The E60's only deficiency was motion resolution. A meager 300 lines with the motion settings disabled.  Setting the Motion Picture to Mid delivers double the resolution, but at the expense of being subjected to having all my movies look like British television. I may have to just get over my aversion to the soap-opera effect and embrace the tech.  I'm on the fence...Despite the motion resolution being weaker than plasma, after seeing the TV in my living room I knew I made the right choice.  My room is not that bright.  Even with the screen on this unit I can see reflections. The mirror-like screens offered on the likes of the S60 would have driven me mad.Another deficiency is the lack of any audio/video delay settings. I want the actor's lips to match the words they are speaking.  I don't think that is asking for too much.  While this is only an issue if you have a receiver in your setup, I don't think it is all that uncommon.  My prior setup was to use my old TV's audio-out in to a stereo receiver... a solution that would not really work brilliantly with this TV. I downloaded the set's user manual from Panasonic so I knew about the issue ahead of time and bought an AV receiver that had the feature I needed.Why not 5 stars?  My 32 inch Sony from a few years back has better anti-reflective properties.  The lack of manual audio / video delay management.  No way to improve motion resolution without getting smoothing (therefore, SOE) along with it.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Way better than expected", "Author": "M.

I didn't expect anything special, mostly bought it because it was very thin, had a very slim bezel around it, and it has wifi/wired internet connectivity along with a bunch of streaming apps.  It's much better than I was expecting, and I'm shocked at the value.NetworkingI have a years old panasonic blu-ray player (bdt220) in my media room.  It also has streaming apps, but the interface is kinda clunky and dated looking.  I was expecting that same interface.  This one is completely different, very modern, streamlined, and impressive.  I primarily use amazon, vudu, and netflix.  Once you are in the apps, they look the same as they do on the older viera interface.  Vudu seems to stream better than amazon, but I think that's an ATT Uverse problem.  It connected to my dlna media server in the house without any issues, and it can access all of my home photos, music, video,etc.  I am peaved that it can't read wmv video files, or wma audio.  Also, I'll complain that it takes 30 seconds or so before it actually connects to the network after booting up, so trying to connect to any internet apps before it's actually connected results in an error.PictureThe picture on the thing is excellent.  I could probably complain about some lighter areas around the edges when the screen is supposed to be completely black, but that's inherent to the edge-lit led technology, and in this set it's not a big problem, i only noticed because i was looking for it.  I was afraid I'd have issues with fast moving objects looking blurry, or pixelated, but they aren't.  They look very natural.  I suppose if i ran some very specific tests on this TV vs some TVs that cost 50-100% more, that this might fall short, but for typical viewing in my living room, this tv is a home run at a bargain price.

In fact we are amazed at all it does, like we can use our iphones to control You Tube or just use the remote and switch between the two controls with no fuss; and more but we haven't gotten to that yet like with DLNA we can stream pictures from our PC's or simply from one of two USB ports via flash drives to play videos, pictures and sound wonderfully and easily.The sound is more than suffice, we haven't been over 52%, still going to use the digital audio connection to our older surround sound cause that's just fun for movie nights but no sound bar needed for daily viewing. The remote is well laid out and easy to understand and use, like pause works on Netflix and video playback on the USB flash drives. I do wish it had a querty keyboard for those few times you got to plunk through the alphabet to enter something, but we have pc's, tablets and phones for web surfing.I am taking back the digital picture frame I bought for Christmas cause this tv can do that as well!! and you can set the timer for when its on or off so we have a 50\" digital picture frame, simply didn't know this and love it.The picture quality is superb, and viewing angles are simply no problem, at about 160 degrees its still perfect, we don't notice any distortion at all. With 120 refresh rate (software increases it towards 240) and 1080 its sweet, colors are vivid and its fine in a room with big patio door and picture window with lots of light and sun. Panasonic did a great job in how the smart tv apps work, they are easy to read and use with the remote and appropriate full use of screen without any idiosyncrasies that irritate you, my wife is not tech savvy, she likes it all simple and she pretty much has no problem. There is only one cord, the power cord, we didn't use the Ethernet hook up we use the wireless it was simple and works great.Overall only complaint is the lack of a querty on the remote, but otherwise super happy with picture, sound, viewing angles, design and function and set up, buffering in the network is almost never (likely not the tvs fault) but when it does its seamless, starts back where you expect it too. The wireless connection was easy and seems pretty much flawless.Being a Panasonic I am presuming to have a long and pleasurable viewing experience.Update Dec 13, 2013:  had it for about a week and must say that the WINDOW GLARE IS AN ISSUE: as is lighting at some angles at night with the screens mirror like finish.

The JVC had nice stereo sound that would carry across the room just fine and was not unpleasant to listen to. The sound on the Panasonic TC-L58E60 doesn't carry far and has zero low end. Tweaking the sound settings on the Panasonic TC-L58E60 (it does have an equalizer and several sound mode settings) didn't help and only made it boomy or tinny at best. I run this TV through my AV receiver (Sony STR-DN840) full time to avoid using the TV speakers. So the TV speakers will work in a pinch but I would advise anyone considering this set to plan on using an AV receiver and speakers or at least a soundbar.As far as picture quality goes I'm impressed. I used the settings for this TV from the CNET review. I have the Disney WOW disc and I've looked at all the test pattern screens and the display seems to be performing well in those tests. The blacks are good and I haven't noticed any kind of clouds or other light distortion. There is a slight \"dirty screen effect\" in the form of narrow vertical bars of slightly darker shade similar to images of other televisions posted on internet forums. This DSE is most prominent on light or solid color screens or bright clouds/sky where the camera is panning across. Most of the time I don't see the problem and I'm fine with it. I really like this TV's picture.This TV has a game mode setting which I've tried with the PS4. Turning the game mode on only results in a slight increase in sharpness of some details. It's difficult for me to tell the difference between game mode off or on so I'm leaving it on for what it's worth. I haven't noticed any problems with lag or any sync problems with between sounds and onscreen action. The tuner on the Panasonic TC-L58E60 with my antenna seems to work great. I get strong signals and a fine HDTV picture. I actually prefer the antenna feed picture over the cable box feed for the local HDTV channels. The antenna feed seems to be slightly more clear.Off-Axis viewing is good with this set. The picture is only slightly faded when viewing from the side, and I mean way off to the side from being in front of it. I frequently stand and watch at about 60 degrees off center to the right of the set and I only notice a slight fading of the image from over there.However, the Disney WOW disc test for off-axis viewing shows a dramatic difference even being slightly off center. The solid pink/purplish test image turns colors when moving even a little off exact center. To me this test seems like overkill when the real world images don't change all that much from different viewing angles.Overall this TV is working great for me and I'm glad I finally upgraded.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good choice!", "Author": "Ohiodeepfreeze", "ReviewID": "RG3NXXFSB9RFY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Would have been 5 stars if not for the remote.

The picture wasn't great until I switched to \"Vivid\", now it's excellent.  Very happy with the TV but there are some things to learn.On cable my amplifier gets the sound from the cable box.  When I go directly to the TV with the cable box off I had to get the audio from the TV connection which is a digital-optical connection, not two simple RCA plugs.  I researched on Amazon and bought a Orei DA34 Digital to Analog decoder, and digital cable.  I had a dual RCA cable which plugged into the amplifier.  That works just fine!Like I wrote in the heading - not just a TV anymore.  In the good 'ol days you attached an antenna and plugged it in.  Those days are gone forever!Then I bought a Harmony 650 Universal Remote.  The set-up is much better than on my old Harmony.

I utilize a Harmon Kardon sound bar by optical cable to get it up to par. The smart features are not as good as hooking it up to a Mac Mini or what. The web browser  is slow and awkward to use. It does make for good alternate access to the Net, it works nicely with my AT&T; router/modem. Though Quicktime and Flash movies will not play by it. There is a slight selection of apps to have to install and select, with Facebook, You Tube, and many more. Though I will be getting an Apple TV to hook up by HDMI in preference. To my chagrin, I discovered there is a porn app available. You can block it from children, but I suppose kids will get around the access. Looks to be hardcore, not soft. I guess most all smart TVs have this, including for Sony, by the looks of it. I hear that only Samsung does not. While I would have gotten the presumed iTV when it does come out, I will still do that, and use the Panasonic as a HDTV for my other room. Seems that 4k isn't going into fast adoption, so I think that I'll be safe with this for now. I watch movies on my Sony with iTunes, but this has its own movie channels, I suppose passable.

At %599 I have no problem recommending this TV to anyone.  Its not a 65 inch top of the line state of the art plasma, but your not paying that kind of scratch for it either.  My advice is if you want a bigger set, you'll give up some picture quality.  In fact, if you have room for a 50 inch the Panasonic budget 720i plasma is about the best bargain out there.  For that money, it gets 5 stars.My TV mount swivels and articulates so the viewing angle is no problem for my application.  Glare is and I have no complaints.

That's why I bought it.  It looked great in the store and it looks great at home, but the other annoying factors are making me strongly consider returning the unit and getting something else.First, there are built-in, onscreen ads.  They can be disabled, thankfully.  But shame on Panasonic for thinking the consumers will be ok with that.  A good enough reason for me to never buy Panasonic products again.The first thing I did was try to watch Netflix using the wifi connection.  About every 5 minutes the connection was lost.  I called Panasonic and they said that the problem was that my wifi signal wasn't compatible, it has to be WPA2 compliant. The phone representative was very rude and unhelpful and insinuated that any problem with the unit was certainly the fault of my setup or ISP.  The modem & router I was using was about 3 years old and was WPA but not WPA2.  I called my ISP and they said I had to upgrade to a faster, more expensive service (79.99/mo, comcast) and upgrade my modem & router.  $200 later (plus the permanent bill increase) the tv will now usually \"only\" dump the connection 2 or 3 times during a movie, which is an improvement, but not satisfactory enough to consider the Netflix app usable via wifi.  The tv is 10 feet from the router.My other complaint is the audio lag.  I now know that most LED tv's have this lag. If you want to use external speakers, the picture and audio will be out of sync unless your audio equipment has a delay feature to synchronize them.  My Panasonic plasma doesn't lag so I wasn't expecting it but then I found out that most LED tv's are this way, so it's worth mentioning.  If you want to use this or any other modern LED tv with external speakers (i.e. surround sound) then you need to have audio equipment that can compensate for the lag.  Now I have to buy a new receiver even though I already own a high end sony that works perfectly.  When I called Panasonic to ask about this, again the rep was rude and said that unless I was using Panasonic audio equipment then there was no way for them to help me, and that I should go out & replace my stereo with Panasonic.So all in all, if you don't have a WPA2 compliant connection and an audio system with adjustable delay then it's gonna cost you several hundred more dollars to properly enjoy this tv.Picture= 5 stars-1 star for built in ads -BOO, Panasonic!-1 star for crappy connection-1 star for rude customer service.I'm not 100% satisfied and I won't ever buy from Panasonic again. :(", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture and Value", "Author": "S.

I have 4 Panasonic TVs from the 2013 line, this being my only LCD from them  (the rest are Plasmas).  While I prefer the plasmas, this unit serves it's purpose well  I use it as part of a live entertainment rig displaying the graphics, the names of wedding couples, corporate logos, etc. during my live band's sets.)  I chose 42\" because I didn't want it to be obtrusive on stage - while a 60\" would be great if we were a bar group, most weddings and corporate clients don't want huge signs distracting from the decor when they've rented a beautiful 20-25k location.I wanted a TV with built in WIFI that plays media over Wifi via DLAP and can also accept a USB Flash Drive if I want to have a stand alone logo on screen for the duration of an event.I have had a few issues with this TV reading media files off of certain flash drives, no matter how they are formatted and no matter the file type.  I can't find a rhyme or reason as to why certain drives are accepted while others aren't when all have been formatted on the same original computer and all are taking the same files from the same server.  That's the only frustrating issue I've had in an otherwise straightforward experience.I've had no issues with burn in (although, the longest an image has been on screen has been 8 hours).  For the short period of time I had this TV at home, the difference between this series and upper end models with \"dual core with hexa processing\" is drastic when using this unit with amazon or netflix.  It is very very slow, and doesn't have nearly the WI-FI range of the upper end models.  I don't use it for these functions, but it is something I noticed (the first time I played an amazon media/netflix stream on my TC-P60ZT60 i was shocked at the difference)All in all, for the money, I've been pleased.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV at bargain price", "Author": "L.

I almost bought the previous year's model when it was on a $100 Amazon credit promotion (5 months ago) and am glad I decided to wait.  The 2013 model is WAY better looking, has built in WIFI, and is thinner as well.  I have also looked at every possible LED TV, and am very pleased with this one.  I am not going to compare it to all the other ones though, as I really like Samsung, LG, and other higher end products as well.  I went with this one simply because I thought it was a way better deal (with the $100 Amazon promotion again) and so far, I think it holds up well against those other high end smart TVs.  My major wish list was simple: Slim, light, great picture, and a good, minimalistic profile.  This delivers on all those.  I am very anal about the flashlighting effect and screen uniformity issues (had to return a larger Samsung in the past over it in exchange for a plasma).  So far, I have not noticed any issues, and the screen seems very uniform.  The picture is phenomenal.  My wife didn't even want this TV, but remarks at how clear and sharp the picture is.  While I didn't specifically buy it for the built in WIFI, that was a plus, and I really like the interface and app options.  I have an Apple TV downstairs and am glad that I can pretty much do the same things on this TV with the built in wifi and apps.  Apple TV does not do Amazon Prime by the way, this TV does.  I am not a Netflix user, but imagine that would be a huge bonus if I was.  I have not used the iPhone with it yet.  I was concerned about the sound quality, as some of these TVs come up short.  I am actually impressed.  Keep in mind, I am not using it for a blue ray or home theater experience, I use my 63 inch Plasma for that.  I cannot speak to the optical out either.  I simply wanted to have normal volume in our bedroom.  It works great for that at low to mid volume, and honestly, I am impressed with the simulated surround option.  Actually sounds pretty good for what I was expecting.  The one and only complaint I have with the TV is that it is designed to be a super slim TV (it is), which in my mind, means it is also designed to mount on a wall.  All of the HDMI (and other outs) are on the back.  They should have found a way to put them on the side.  I had to buy a 90 degree HDMI adapter to get it to fit tightly with my low-profile mount.

Youtube app does not work since day one.  amazon app stopped working after a couple of days - the stand does not swivel, this is a huge problem if  you need to rotate the tv to connect cables. - Buttons on the TV are at the back, you cannot see them and since you cannot rotate the stand - ads needs to be disabled, but they still come on when you launch the \"app store\". huge annoyance  I did not expect this from a TV company.Overall I am not happy with my purchase.

The Panasonic thus far has been excellent. I have not spent a lot of time fine-tuning the picture controls, but with only a little tweaking the picture quality has been very satisfactory. I do think the old Sony had slightly better Caucasian flesh-tones but not by a lot. Picture sharpness is excellent. Motion seems to be handled well; the set does fine with baseball and football, for example. I played with the included apps and browser for a while, and have pretty much decided that I don't need them; they respond slowly, despite a hard-wired Internet connection via gigabit equipment, which leads me to believe the internal processor in the TV is the culprit. The Panasonic Viera Link HDMI communication turns out to work well with my Sony Bravia sound bar and Sony upscaling DVD player, which makes me happy - for the most part, I need only a single DirecTV remote control to run everything but my Roku. BTW, the sound quality of the TV is pretty good (better than the old Sony), but is much better (especially bass) with the sound bar. So far, this has been a good purchase and I would do it again.

The TV is super-thin and only has about a 1/2\" frame around the edges. Looks awesome on the stand that came with it in my exercise room. An added and unexpected bonus was the delivery: the man who brought it picked it up by himself and carried it up the stairs to the room (denied my offer to help). He then helped me disconnect the DVD player and cable from the old tv, and got out the new tv and set it up and made sure it was working correctly. He then took the box with him to dispose of it. Very nice delivery and set up! It turned out the TV was so far away from my router that it wouldn't operate Netflix. I bought a wifi booster (Almond brand) that did the job very well.

After a simple set-up, you have everything you need for a tech geek like me. I always wanted a Smart TV, and this TV has all of your favorite apps such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu+, etc. One thing I did feel the price was a bit on the high, at $1200, than most smart TV's. For those who don't like Smart TV's, you may feel that the customization of screens could be too much. Seriously, this isn't your TV if you are not a fan of Smart TVs. If you are not a fan, you will be annoyed with the different screens, and adds that pop up when changing between screens. Internet connectivity was flawless, and watching Amazon and Netflix shows was a breeze. Watching Blu-Ray on this television was also on another level.

Everything was pretty-much perfect and when it came time to mount the TV onto the multi-adjustable bracket, turned out that the VESA (400x200) mounting holes on the back of the TV have two holes on center, but the other two screw mount holes are insted, just 5\" below the top lip of the TV!So, it is impossible to mount this television on center using \"normal\" measurements and templates which come with nearly every mounting bracket kit on the market.Why Panasonic decided to place the VESA mounting holes so high on the  back of the set is a mystery, and probably an afterthought, as all of the connections, including A/C cord are on the back of the set, making mounting difficult in any setting, without having to worry about the mounting brackets covering or interfering with the HDMI or other inputs.In all, good to very good picture, but...Cons outweight the pro's, and this TV is going back.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad TV", "Author": "peterpolgar", "ReviewID": "R341XRN36VR0XM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "All in all this TV is worth as much as its cost.

Actually 2, the first one was struck by lightning after a month of use and needed two simple parts... But after months of trying between me and my repair man, panasonic cant provide any info on the parts.. One is a simple power supply but they act as though they have never heard of it! So my insurance replaced the TV with another of the same model. The TV has very bad flashlighting that occurs after barely any use.. You can see it on all 4 quadrants of the Screen not just on the corners. This was the same for both of the TVs. The TV is not built well at all and the back panel is very flimsey and will cave in if you push on it a little which i suspect is the cause of the flashlighting.. Atleast one cause anyway.The smart function of this TV is mediocre at best and responds very slow like a computer that is 10 years old. Sound is horrible like others have said but i use a sound system so tha doesnt affect me just worth noting.The picture doesnt go all the way to the bevels it stops about .5 inches from it which is kind of a cheat i feel.And to top everything else off, the Xbox 360 has HDMI handshake issues with HDMI port 2, but no other port has a problem with it which i suspect is cause port 2 has ARC and there is some compatibility problem with it that they need to fix... But when i call tech support i get a useless person who gives me no help and offers no answers.. Then has the nerve to say \"is there anything else i can help you with.\" Worst tech support by FAR most likely because they outsource their support to other companies.. That shows alot of care for the customers right? (The part department is out of country.)So I am stuck with a TV now I am not happy with, one that cant be repaired because panasonic refuses to provide parts so that is useless, and have to deal with support people that are useless including the supervisors that i have spoke to who are very unprofessional and untrained!These are all important things to consider when purchasing this TV!
