{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Picture and Very Good Sound!", "Author": "Calvin \"The one and only.\"", "ReviewID": "R8PEI9RIP8RC8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this tv a few days ago and it's great! The picture quality is amazing! I have monster HDMI cables and Optimum HD and tv shows never looked so beautiful. The sound is really good. I leave it on 17 or so and I believe it goes up to the 70's.  Don't quote me on that though. I also have an Xbox 360 hooked up via the component cables and it makes me truly appreciate the investment I made buying the next-gen console. There are plenty of inputs/outputs.  The only gripe I have so far is that the remote is really simple. Sony remotes usually have a ton of options and buttons but not this one. You can even connect your computer onto the tv and have picture in picture with the tv playing in the bottom right. (haven't tried yet though!)  I really recommend buying this TV.  It is a fair price for a great product.UPDATE: DEC 1, 2010.3 Years later and this TV is still perfect. This proves my theory that when you buy TV's you gotta go for the name brands. I know people who get Olivea, Vizio, and even Samsung HDTV's to have them have issues within the first year(like sound issues and snowy line towards top of display, not to mention samsung cutting off portions at the bottom of the screen). I use this tv everyday and a lot of times leave it on for 10+ hours. I still have not had one issue for the last 3 years. This was a great investment and trust me when I say...Sony makes the best TVs.UPDATE: DEC 2, 2011.Wow. What a coincidence I happened to look at this almost one year from today. I still have this TV and it is still working great. If you don't believe me, email me for a pic lol. I've been waiting for this tv to die to finally upgrade to 1080, but it's not letting me. lol. Still works just like the day I got it. Well actually, the only thing I noticed that's not up to my standards is that when I turn it on, the Sony logo on the screen is not perfect and looks like the green layer is not lined up properly in regards to the other red and blue whatever you call them that makes up the picture. But after that goes away, the screen is not messed up and displays everything perfectly. If you can find this at a great price and don't mind it's 720p, get this.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Buy for LCD TV", "Author": "Yacklott", "ReviewID": "R1U3DZF8RXHFV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The quality of this brand is outstanding. The colors are bright and vivid and the picture is clear. The viewing angles are amazing at 178 degrees, which puts you pretty much standing right along side the tv.  Its a good idea to view all the sellers for this product, because I was able to find one who offered free shipping, and that made the purchase all the more attractive.  The price is a little bit more then other brands,  but I promise, you won't be unhappy with this lcd once you get it.  I liked my first Bravia so much, this makes my third purchase of this brand.", "Date": "April 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Outstanding LCD HDTV!", "Author": "Beachbum2u \"Councilman\"", "ReviewID": "R3ATC4Z21K7CPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is outstanding.  The picture and sound quality is out of this world!  Sony has made this HDTV to be the best one out on the market.  I was totally blown away by the resolution and sharpness.  The sound is superb.  It is well worth the price.  I highly recommend buying this one -- bravo Bravia!!!", "Date": "December 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "JeanK", "ReviewID": "R3L47B1DPENRMX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV several months ago and I've been very happy with it.  The picture is crisp and the sound is good (most of the time I can set it in the low 20's).  The remote doesn't have a lot more buttons than the number pad but how many more do you need? Menu navigation is easy; I can quickly turn on closed captioning when needed and then turn it off.  I purchased the cables required to connect my laptop to the TV so I can watch shows on the Internet on my TV.  That setup is quick and easy.  Overall, a TV I'd recommend.", "Date": "July 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worked great for about 2 years", "Author": "Scott D. Smith \"Scott\"", "ReviewID": "R192L0YQ85HTF9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this Sony Bravia model in December of 2007. It worked pretty well for a couple of years, but then developed a problem with a 4\" wide dark vertical \"stripe\" that appeared on the right-hand portion of the screen. My guess is that one of the sub-sections of LCD display has gone bad. It's out of warranty, so not worth fixing. I have always been a big fan of Sony's products, having used both their consumer and professional equipment for a number of years. This has been a big disappointment.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV, setup is horrible", "Author": "Robert W. Smith", "ReviewID": "R2CLJT30AVCKNI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great sound, great picture, great price, looks great, EXACTLY what I needed. In setup and ease of use, however, I'd give it a zero.  The instruction manual is complex, technical and very vague and not quite complete.  They show several 'typical' systems that aren't anything like mine.  I STILL don't have it set up right.  It does have LOTS of inputs and SHOULD be very flexible, but not in my experience.  I'm not sorry I bought it but it is by far the most difficult system I have seen to set up and work with.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "KDL-26M3000, my purchase experience", "Author": "J. Adams", "ReviewID": "R232I2UH2KV6S5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the KDL-26M3000 and it it arrived in a perfectly mint box but was extremely scratched up on the front frame and looked used.  For reference, floor model, open box TVs are usually in MUCH better condition.  It also came directly from Amazon and not a partner.  It is very difficult to imagine this was not intentional but I moved on and attempted to return it.  I had to call 6x and it took over two weeks for the shipper to pick it up.  They took it back but obviously it was a huge hassle and I would not shop Amazon for anything of significance as a result.  There are simply too many other vendors available.
