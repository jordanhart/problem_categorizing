{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Stunning Picture & Quality", "Author": "CE Purchaser", "ReviewID": "R3A037V3H35EBZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With so many options on a new TV, I researched all possibilities in just about every brand.  Naturally I was initially drawn to Samsung, LG and Sony, the brands that seem to have established a high quality perception.  After analyzing all the specs and then comparing the actual image quality first-hand in retail stores, I was surprised to discover the picture quality of this RCA TV was at the same level or HIGHER than the others.  At home, my expectations were exceeded.  Very easy to set up, my Blu-ray movies look stunning (better than the Sony LED I replaced, and better than my older Panasonic plasma which is still in use - I was indeed surprised), with no ghosting or blurring of fast images - everything appears crisp and crystal clear.  HD programs from my cable provider, especially sporting events, are equally crisp and vibrant - which was viewed during our Super Bowl game party this past Sunday.  Everyone was amazed by the image quality and sleek design of this RCA TV.  The viewing angle is wider than most other brands, the blacks are rich, and the colors are bright.  On top of all these benefits, the price is truly astounding, which is literally several hundred dollars less than other brand's comparable models.  If you're looking for a high quality TV for your viewing entertainment with a stunning picture at a great price, you will be pleasantly surprised and delighted with this RCA television!", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture for portraits but not motion.", "Author": "~ANT~", "ReviewID": "R40G6SD0O56GI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was one tough purchase for me. For one, I've always liked Sony and Samsung so to veer away from them was a risk in its self but i was money conscious and i needed a new TV because my plasma Samsung recently went out on just after 4 years (model HP-T5054).I read as many reviews as i could and tried to make a wise decision but this RCA 55\" just has no comparison to my old Samsung. The colors are vibrant and its super thin ill give it that but when the objects or people move during a movie or show they blur every time. This TV also doesn't up convert all input devices to 1080, only 720 unless using blue-ray but still blurs. To top it off during blue-ray playback it switches between 24Hz and 60Hz but haven't seen 120Hz the entire week I've owned it. (there is a display button on the remote to see the resolution and Hz anytime you want). I will be returning this TV back to Wal-Mart where i bought it.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "55 - Inch LED Full 1080p, 120Hz HDTV, 4 HDMI Connections, Resolution: 1920 x 1080, Tuner Mode: ATSC/NTSC, Contrast: 5000:1", "Name": "RCA LED55B55R120Q 55-Inch LED Full 1080p 120Hz HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mvZTiEq%2BL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00856XE7M"}}
