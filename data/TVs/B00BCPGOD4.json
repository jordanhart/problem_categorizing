{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I can't wipe the smile off of my face", "Author": "KD", "ReviewID": "R15YDKO58T9228", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did lots and lots of research before I settled on this TV. I am not the type of person who buy a TV only to find issues with it then do the old swapperoo with another one only to find another thing I dislike about it. I bought this only after very extensive research and due diligence.What I look for in a good TV: great picture quality, great side viewing quality, accurate colors, bright and punchy whites, high contrast, black blacks, great SmartTV features, Netflix, media streaming, good enough input lag to play games, and as future proof as possible.It looks like I'm asking a lot right? There couldn't possibly be a TV that fit all these criteria could there? Fortunately for me, there is!When it comes to great picture quality and side viewing, LCD/LED TV's are quickly eliminated. Winner Plasma. That was quick! I absolutely hated the faded contrast from side viewing, uneven brightness, and graish blacks on the LCD/LED TVs. The problem with most Plasmas are that they look faded during the day. Some of the top modern plasmas have done fairly well in that area.I narrowed my TV's down to the Samsung F8500 and the VT60/ZT60. I did comparisons of the TV's at a brick and mortar store and found that I'm drawn more toward the F8500 with each comparison. Every single reviewer out there claims \"black blacks\" as if that is the epitome of great picture quality. Do I buy a TV to stare at a black screen? I tried as hard as I could, but I just could not see the differences between the blacks of the ZT60 and the F8500 in a normal lit area. I'm sure in absolute darkness, I can probably see a difference. However, this TV will be my main TV in my living room with windows all around and 4 recess lights above it. I do not have a \"man cave\" like some lucky few out there.Next comes the comparison of the whites and color production. In a normal viewing environment, there's no contest in my eyes. The almost LED-like brightness of the F8500 trumps the VT60/ZT60. The contrast, the pop, and the blinding whites (for a plasma) makes the picture jump out. The problem with most plasma is that the picture is usually washed out during the day. The F8500 seems to have solved this problem. The goal of many plasma makers were always to go as black as possible, but no one ever thought about going the other way--make whites as white as possible. Why is darkness more important than brightness? Why is a .002% difference in black level make one TV superior to the other when the other TV has 30% better whites and deeper contrasts? Am I going crazy here? I don't understand why the \"experts\" think that makes one TV \"better\" than the other as if black blacks is the single defining criteria for picture quality.The SmartTV features of the F8500 seems to be better than the Panasonic as well. The F8500 has a built-in camera which allows for the use of Skype and gesture (something I don't use and think it's a gimmick). However, being able to video call on your TV is a pretty cool added feature. The camera on the Panasonic is an extra added cost. The F8500 offers HVEC (.265) which future proof it. This may not be important now as .265 is not wide spread, but once it's adopted, better quality streaming will be available through Netflix, Youtube, and home streaming. It's good to know that this future technology is available right now on the TV you purchase. The TV may produce great picture quality, but if you have a low quality stream, then the picture quality will be bad. Garbage in, garbage out.The one thing that this has going against it is the input lag. This is the pitfall of the excellent Samsung video processing algorithm. I believe the VT and ZT has a slightly better input lag of 47ms. On PC mode, the F8500 averages around 53ms. This is not great, but it's absolutely playable and I don't notice much of a difference when I game. Another thing to consider is that when playing over the network, the 60ms lag for the screen is far faster than the 120-400ms ping lag for your packets going over the network. How often have you played a game and you swear up and down you shot the guy but missed and ended up dead? That's network lag spike. The biggest killer of your K/D ratio  (besides your skill of course) is the spike in the network and not your TV. I think input lag is overblown unless you're playing over a LAN. In that case, a nice 24\" LED monitor would be your best bet, not this beast of a plasma that you use for movies and sports.CONS- I don't like the remote and the sensitively of the touch pad. Often times I scroll down, and the thing goes left. What-The-F. I'm purchasing the keyboard for this TV to eliminate messing with the remote more than I have to.- Speakers. Not a con for me as I don't use it. If I can afford to pay for this TV, I can afford an AVR with nice speakers or at least a decent soundbar.- The finicky ARC port. I think this is due to the HDMI implementation rather than the TV itself. They need to let people configure how this works. I'm not sure who is to blame, the AVR or the TV. I basically use HDMI 3 (ARC) to output video from my AVR to my TV. However, when I turn on the Smart apps and Netflix, ARC should turn on and have the sound come out of the AVR automatically. It works, except whenever I turn on the TV, it automatically set my AVR to TV/CD instead of leaving it alone. I have to manually switch the input back to Cable/SAT. So in order to remedy this, I have to buy THREE new 15 foot HDMI cables (I run the cables through the wall). One goes in HDMI1 for output from AVR, one goes in HDMI 3 for return audio to AVR for TV apps, and then one goes from PS3 to HDMI 2 for PC mode (sound will go back out through HDMI3).All in all, I cannot wipe the smile of my face every time I watch a movie on this TV. The video processing is astounding. Moving up from an older LN52A750, the picture quality is far more natural with much higher quality coming out of the same Netflix stream and satellite signal. Had the input lag made gaming unbearable, I would've knocked a star off this TV. However, since it doesn't bother me, this is absolutely a five star TV. In terms of features, picture quality, brightness, contrast, and blacks, there isn't a TV out there that's close.Update 7/28: revised input lag from 60ms to 53ms for F8500 and 40 to 47ms for ZT60 as tested by CNET.Update 8/19/13: The TV has performed flawlessly. I watch NFL football and the TV looks great during the day which is the majority of my viewing (50% sports, 30% movies, 20% gaming). This is the perfect TV for sports watching as black level doesn't even come into the equation. I also watch Oblivion at night and the black level is excellent (lots of dark scenes). The quality is superb.Image Retention: There was IR when I watched NFL network initially. The IR (bar at bottom) disappeared within 5 sec after I changed the channel. That was the only time I saw IR. After 30 days of using the TV, I no longer see IR. I can only assume that this plasma is good at limiting IR after the initial break in period.Video games: The difference between 30ms and 53ms is 2/100 of a second. It's up to you if it affects you. To me, it's negligible.Noise: No plasma high pitch sound that I can hear.Tip: I deleted the STB from the TV set up. It's useless and causes the \"STB is not powered on message.\" The guide from the TV is useless because (1) it always start at channel 2, and (2) it doesn't have all the channel information. If you delete the STB, the SmartTV button takes you immediately to apps instead of the guide which is functionality useless and redundant. Since the TV takes 8 sec to power on, putting in a 10 sec delay from the Harmony remote will allow you to use activity to always put the TV and receiver to the correct input, thus overriding the finicky CEC control.Also, if you use an AVR, set the sound delay to 100ms normally. The sound is synched properly if you use the TV speakers.Update 11/20/13: I got a PS4 connected with PC mode and games play perfectly fine. Resogun is a reflex game and I haven't had any lag deaths so I believe this lag hype is overblown. Also, since I have to connect the PS4 to the TV and have the sound return via ARC, it downmixes to stereo even with 5.1 sound! It's a legality issue that does not allow the TV to pass through 5.1 sound via ARC. I will admit defeat and will turn off ARC and use an optical cable instead in order to get Digital 5.1 sound from Netflix and PS4 passthrough back to my AVR. ARC is effectively useless for those with a AVR set up. This will also free up the annoying automatic input change. I recommend just not using ARC altogether as it's broken. This is not a Samsung issue but an ARC issue and affects all manufacturer.Also, Netflix recently updated its Netflix app for many set top boxes. The app on this TV is not updated yet, but the TV should support it as Smart Apps are all upgradeable. I will update this review when Samsung updates the Netflix app. Update: Sure enough, the app is now updated. This TV so far is future proof!Update 3/14/14:If you want to go directly to the Smart Apps screen when you hit the Smart Hub button instead of the useless upcoming shows screen, you can do so by going back to the Set Up menu. Menu -> System -> Set Up. Go to the end where you are asked to enter your TV provider and Zip code. Enter your zip code then Select \"My Provider's not here\" instead of your normal broadcast location. This will eliminate the shows guide when you hit SmartHub and take you directly to your Smart apps!", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful PQ", "Author": "J. Young \"Hello\"", "ReviewID": "R2CKCDUFT5X5TJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 05-09-2014:  Well, I just wanted to provide an update since it has been well over a year now. This TV still functions flawlessly and the PQ is as good as ever. Not one hardware issue.  A couple of the firmware updates over this past year really made it that much better.Update 04-24-2013: I was finally brave enough to use my Xbox and PS3. Out of the 2, I think the PS3 looked better, but that is subjective. Both looked good and I did not notice any lag. I did COD BO2 on the Xbox and Oblivion on the PS3. I play my Xbox exclusively on a 24 monitor, so of course it should look better on the F8500.  The potential for burn-in though still has me concerned.  I most likely will never game much or at all on it.So to all of the crusaders out there, this is a great TV. Is it the best? I cannot answer that since I only own this one. At a minimum, it is definitely pretty good.Update 04-15-2013: I would really like to know how they reduce reflection on the screen like they do. I was sitting in the LR with the TV off. If was in the middle of the day and I had the bay window curtains and blinds wide open.  I could see reflections in the TV, but they looked really soft.  Blurry like. The images further away were even less visible. I mention this because I did watch a full BR with the same lighting conditions.  While I did, I barely saw any reflections in the glass and for what I could see, I really had to stare at it to see.With many hours now, the light pops still happen at cell brightness 16 and 17. I was obviously hoping that would go away. I have settled using a cell brightness of 14 for now, so not a huge deal.  I like a cell brightness of 20, but during night viewing, that almost blinds me.  No firmware updates available since the one I did when I received the 8500.Watching the Masters this weekend was a delight. The 8500 handled it well and everything looks beautiful.  Hopefully that means football will look good on it when the season comes.  Next weekend, I am going to get more brave and try a hour or two of Black Ops 2 via the XBox.Update 04-01-2013: Well, it is still beautiful. If you got the money and you want to try Plasma, this one is definitely on the short list.  I have watched various content in every possible lighting scenario so far and everything is clear and as bright as I would hope it to be. Even content most would consider poor or from a poor source still looks better than on any other TV I have ever owned.I am not fond of needing to worry about IR and burn-in, but for the beautiful PQ, I will learn to live with needing to do that. The smart apps do give issues now and then. I still think it is an update needed. In the long run, I doubt I use the smart apps since just about everything else I own has the same apps already.We watched a few movies now in 3D. I am not a huge fan of 3D, but I can say that the movies i did watch on this TV were really good. I mean really good. Avatar was gorgeous.The price to pay for really good PQ as this TV provides is that it changes what you see.  Many times for the better, but sometimes not such as some movies you can so easily now see what is fake and what is real.The only strange thing the TV is doing to me is every time I turn it on and select the source, in a couple of minutes, the screen goes completely black and then comes back.  Sometimes it will display the info screen as if I just changed the input, which I did not.  Hopefully just a firmware issue. It only does it once after turning it on and never again until the next time.Original:My first plasma. In the past, every time I would see a plasma TV in the store, I was never impressed.  Hard to see in most cases and almost always more money.As I was looking for a new TV this year, I saw that the new plasma TVs were just getting released.  I admit that the marketing made me look twice, especially when it mentioned much better brightness.  While waiting for any to come into stock, I started reading about as much as I could on plasma TVs in general and for this exact model.  I liked it enough to give it a try.  At least Amazon has a decent return policy in case this was a horrible decision.The TV itself looks very nice. I rent, so I cannot mount on the wall.  The stand is nice and different then others.  I do not really care though.  As long as it makes the TV stable.The picture is beautiful via DirecTV hookups.  Most channels and even older content look pretty good.  Viewing a BRD is even better.  The black levels are out of this world.  Hardly any, if any, artifacts or distortions of any kind in the picture.  The TV does get rather bright and you can see the picture just fine in daylight.  I have it in a room with a bay window and so far, I can see okay.There is a slight buzz that you can hear when you get close or with some content when further away.  I have to mute the sound though to hear it.  From what I read, this is common with plasma TVs with some much louder than others.  With nothing that I can compare with, this noise has not been noticed by me until I purposefully listened for it.There is also some flickering with certain cell brightness settings for me, namely value 16 and 17.  Any other setting so far is fine.  Not enough to dock anything yet, but I am keeping an eye on this.The remote is different with few physical buttons, but I find it not too hard getting used to sliding the thumb around to move the cursor.  Definitely slows you down though.  The Smart Apps on the TV are like most competitor apps. Nothing too special, but not bad.  I did play the Amazon app last night and it does not work properly.  Anything I stream with it causes the video to blink on and off (completely black for a second then back on).  It only does this in this app, so surely just an app issue.I have a lot of things to try yet and many adjustments to make to perfect the picture, but so far I am excited and loving the PQ. Much better than anything I have ever owned yet.  I never thought I would own a plasma, but I do believe this one may be it for me.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung outperformed themselves", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1BSS90IWZWWVM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Usually over time you see TV's pricing dropping... month after month. It is very rare when a price stay solid for long time or even goes up. This is the case with the SAMSUNG PNF8500. Samsung simply outperformed themselves with this amazing panel. Its price stay steady for 6 months now and there are many reasons why...Just to clarify I own an AV integration company and we sell and install audio and video equipment for smart homes and home theater.Here are several factors that make this panel outstanding compared to other panels. some are generic to Plasma technology and some are specific to this panel:1. Refresh rate - Unlike LCD/LED panels that offers 120Hz refresh rate, Plasma TV's offers 600Hz which is 5 times compared to LCD/LED. without getting too much into technical details, what this means to you is that high motion images such as sports and action movies looks much smoother on Plasma then on LCD/LED2. Lifelike Colors - It is known that LCD/LED panels shows more saturated and vibrant colors. But ask yourself, is that how the world around you really looks like? When you watch a movie or a TV show, you want the skin tone of a person on the screen to look as close to real life as possible.3. Contrast Ratio - Contrast ratio, or the ratio between the darkest part of the image and the brightest, is one of the most important factors in overall picture quality. A display with a high contrast ratio is going to seem more realistic, and have more virtual \"depth\".4. Black Levels - This is related to contrast ratio. Although LED panels can offer absolute black, overall Plasma panels would offer darker image where dark scene is viewed, creating a more realistic image.5. Viewing Angle - LCD/LED panels lose picture quality when viewed \"off axis,\" as in not directly in front of the screen.6. Brightness - Up until this model, Plasma panels were darker and recommended to be installed in a darker room. however this Samsung panel brings new dynamic brightness which align this panel with the brightness seen on LED panels.7. Web Apps - with the growing trend in streaming content over the internet, more and more consumers are looking to be able to stream content from sources such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, You Tube etc. Samsung as proven to lead the industry with their app rich Smart Hub. They offer tens of apps and continue to constantly adding new apps and content resources through frequent updates. Their user interface is extremely user friendly and easy to operate.8. Connectivity - This panel supports HDMI V1.4 which means you can control other devices that are connected to this panel using the smart remote control shipped with the TV. HDMI specifications provide special channels for 2-way communication between devices that are HDMI 1.4 certified hence the ability to control them with one remote. for the fairness this function is slightly buggy as it is in its first stages but it is a nice feature to have.9. Built In Camera - This panel comes with built-in video camera allowing you to use Skype and other social apps as well as you can control the TV using gesture commands. Gesture commands is a new technology which interpret the movement of your hands to control the system. for example you can swap your hand in the air from left to right and it will swap the screen to the right or scroll the apps to the right if you are on the Smar Hub screen. If you played with XBOX Kinnect, this is similar technology.Just keep in mind, if you are planing to mount the TV on the wall, you want it to be low enough so the camera can capture you while sitting on the couch.10. Voice Activation - In addition to the gesture technology, you can operate the TV via voice commands. While this seem like a very cool feature that actually works, I know many people choose to turn it off.11. Streaming - Streaming from Netflix and other HD services works fine and smoothly if you have good internet connection. The TV has enough buffer that you can watch an entire XHD movie from VUDU without stops or bumps.CONS=======There is no such thing as perfect device and this panel has it's own little quirks that may or may not be a deal breaker:1. Remote control - Samsung tried to be a bit smarter by replacing the traditional hard buttons with a touch surface that acts as a mouse. While this is pretty bold approach, I find it somewhat limiting as you need to make some extra clicks to get the rest of the options.2. HDMI Implementation - As I mentioned above, HDMI V1.4 allows to supported equipment to communicate via the HDMI cable and save the need of running extra cables between components. Another feature is the Audio Return Channel (ARC) which allow the TV to send the sound back to your AV receiver so you can hear the sound of the streaming content such as Netflix through your surround sound system rather than through the TV's speakers. With this feature, the TV can control the AV Receiver and switch the source on the receiver automatically to TV Audio and play the sound through the speakers. Unfortunately, either as a bug or intentionally, the way this was implemented by Samsung doesn't play nice with other components. When you turn on the TV, it will always send a command to the receiver and switch the source on the receiver to TV Audio.3. Power Light - This is more of a personal semantics.... the power light is turned red when the TV is in off state. The light will turn off when the TV is on. The problem is if there is no picture on the screen, there is no way to know if the TV is on or the power was cutoff completely. I wish the light could change to dark blue when the TV is on.CONCLUSION===========All in all this is a real winner among the many choices available today. It offers outstanding image quality as well as amazing array of apps and other features. In fact I was so impressed by this panel that I got one for myself. If you can afford shelling $1800 I highly recommend this panel", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressive picture, but that's about it...", "Author": "B. Wilson", "ReviewID": "R361IQ3MSROPA9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had my expectations on this TV pretty high. I've always bought Samsung TVs. I have 3 others, and this one I was buying to put in place of my LN52A750 (a fantastic TV, and still using today). I had my eye on all the Samsung TVs as the 2012 models were released. Those had mixed reviews, so waited another year. As soon as the 2013s were released, I had my eye on the 8000 series LED, and this one, the 8500 Plasma. Due to the size of my entertainment center, I was between either the 60\" plasma or 65\" LED. After months of reading reviews, looking at the TVs on showroom floors, and what not, I pulled the trigger on the PN60F8500. Boy was I excited! My thoughts and experience below-Shipping:The white glove service is the way to go, whether it's through Amazon or one of the other 3rd party retailers. I didn't want to have to hassle putting it on the stand and into the entertainment center myself. I prefer to hook up all the cables myself, but the rest, someone else can do. They'll even take away the box if you want, but I decided to hang on to it just in case I needed to return it.Styling:Before turning it on, I had mixed feelings on the styling of the TV. I knew what it looked like beforehand of course, and even before the purchase I thought it looked a bit outdated. However, I decided to look past that, thinking that when I'm actually watching TV, I will only be concerned with the quality of the picture. I told my wife my thoughts on the styling about a week after we got the TV, and she said, \"Yeah, I thought the same thing, but I didn't want to say anything.\" Haha. Anyway, this is obviously personal preference. Some people will love it, others will not care, and some won't like it. In the end, I still don't think a decision should be made off how it looks, rather the picture quality and viewing experience.Picture Quality:Out of the box, not changing any settings - the picture is excellent. However, there are some tweaks to the settings that are needed (see below). Off angle viewing to the sides is good. However, you don't want to be looking down at this TV (fortunately, for me, my setup has the TV somewhat above eye level when sitting, so I only noticed standing and near the TV). A downward angle creates a very dim picture. I'm guessing this has something to do with the anti-glare screen on the TV, which by the way is very good. I was concerned that there may be too much light in the room for a plasma, but didn't notice anymore glare than what was on the LN52A750 in the same space. The PN60F8500 might even have less. Overall, picture quality is why I bought this TV. The reviews had been great, and I can attest the picture is crisp, colors are vivid, blacks are very black, etc. Nobody has been lying when they say all those things. I made minimal changes to the picture settings, but there are 2 that I think are absolutely necessary:-For me, the cell light was on around a 15 by default. The picture was much too dim, and I had to put the cell light all the way up to the max (20). I also enabled the sensor that detects light in the room and adjusts accordingly, thinking that 20 would probably be too bright in a dark room. I put the minimum cell light at 15. After the change, I was happy with how bright it was, regardless of the light conditions in the room.-Turn off Motion Judder. This setting creates some weird movements. If you notice a person with slow then quick movements that seem unnatural occurring on the screen, it's likely because of this setting. Many reviews have already talked about this setting, and I too highly recommend that it is turned off. Many 1 star reviewers I think had this setting on. Anyway, if you turn it off, the motions are much better, more natural, and you'll enjoy it much more.Remote:The Smart Touch Remote is the only remote that comes with the TV. There is a HUGE learning curve to use this remote. And to put this in perspective, I'm a guy in my late 20s who is very tech savvy, and is often treated as the IT Help Desk by my friends and family. So if I'm having issues with the remote, I'm fairly sure others will too. I'd suggest either buying another Samsung remote (the old school style with more actual buttons), or using a universal remote. Samsung includes an IR blaster to control a set-top box, but I did not use it.Voice Control:This feature was nearly useless for me. The response time was slow. It would pick up sound randomly, thinking I was trying to talk with the TV because you can say something like, \"Hello TV,\" to activate the voice control. When it waits for commands, the TV sound goes off. So that happening randomly because it picks up a conversation in the room was a bit annoying. When I actually did want to use the voice control, it wasn't very good at understanding the commands. I have a Samsung GS3, and my wife has the GS4. Both phones have great voice control. So I'm not sure why this TV can't be as good. Seems like they would have used the same voice recognition technology. Anyway, I ended up just having to turn off the TV voice control entirely.Motion Control:Surprisingly, I found this feature to work fairly well. However, I didn't find many opportunities to use it and ended up turning it off. So I'll just leave it at that.Camera:The camera is a cool add-on if you want to Skype. There are some other apps that use the camera as well, but I didn't use them. The camera can be hidden just by pushing it in to the tv, and easily pops out. However, this has to be done by hand. There is not button or auto setting to have the camera pop up when needed, which would be nice. It's a little creepy having a camera always looking at you. A problem I had with the camera is the angle of it. There is a small roller on top of the camera that can adjust the camera angle up or down slightly. However, the adjustment is minimal, and even adjusted all the way down, you could just see the top of heads sitting on the couch. For others, this may not be an issue, just depends on your setup. In the end, I had the camera hidden most of the time. Also if you do not have the camera out, the TV will prompt you that motion control will not be available unless you turn off motion control. A little annoying to get the pop up every time I turn on the TV or use the Smart Hub, so I ended up turning off the motion control.Smart Hub:There are multiple screens within the Smart Hub. I found them to be useless except the Apps. If you have Netflix, Amazon Prime or some other streaming service that is compatible, this is an excellent, very convenient way to stream. I had previously used a PS3 for these tasks, but greatly prefer the Smart Hub apps over the PS3. In general the interface is the same if you're already familiar with the PS3, and I would guess it would look about the same if you had a Roku, Xbox, or Apple TV or some other streaming device. I use a wired internet connection to the TV, so not sure if the same experience applies to WiFi, but I did not have issues with buffering. In addition to Netflix and Amazon Prime, I also used MLB.tv and Spotify. Both good, but did have a little trouble with the initial setup of my Spotify account and playlists. Eventually, it worked. One other thing to note is that by default the Smart Hub will load when you turn on the TV. My personal preference was to disable that setting, and just have it turn on to the video source I was last using (usually HDMI 1).RVU:I have DirecTV and had initially planned on using RVU on this TV instead of a box. I have the new Genie setup which supports it, and thought this might be a little bit better. If you aren't familiar with RVU, it allows you to watch your programming without having a box. It just goes directly into the TV. I don't quite understand the setup. If I understand correctly, it uses the ethernet port. In theory it sounded great, but by using RVU, you are at the mercy of the Samsung remote. You cannot use a DirecTV remote if you are using RVU. I already discussed my thoughts on the remote, but the big problem I had was that Samsung doesn't allow the full functionality of the DirecTV remote. You either have to use the Samsung Guide, which isn't as good as DirecTV's, or you have to swipe and click through multiple pages to get to DirecTV's guide. Other features to control fast forward, rewind, pause, setting a recording, etc are all much more difficult. Features like bringing up the scoreguide, starting a program from the beginning, etc. are cumbersome. In the end, I just ended up getting another DirecTV box so I could use a DirecTV remote. I'm not sure if a universal remote would fix these problems with RVU control or not. I think the issue really lies with the interface of Samsung and it's compatibility with DirecTV function. I think that a universal remote using RVU would still limit you to the commands that a Samsung remote would send to the TV. So in my experience, I'll stick with the DirecTV box to keep my features.Chromecast Compatibility:You might be thinking, \"Why are you hooking up a Chromecast to a TV with so many apps and other features, including Allshare?\" Well, I liked the idea of looking at a YouTube video on my computer and then just asking it to play on my TV with a click of a button instead of having to search for it again. Plus, my experience with Allshare on non-Samsung products has not been great. I was hoping Chromecast would be better at sharing tabs, but see my Chromecast review for that. Anyway, Chromecast would not work on the PN60F8500. When first powered on, it would say something like \"Starting your Chromecast...\" Then, go black. Then, it would give me the Samsung \"No Signal\" floating message. I tried it in every HDMI port, with wall power, and using USB power. Made sure all the firmware and software was updated on the TV and Chromecast. No luck. Tried calling Google support and Samsung Support. After all kinds of troubleshooting, nobody had an answer, and the last Samsung support person (escalated), pretty much gave up and said it was probably a compatibility issue. Well I'm not sure why it would work on 3 other Samsung TVs, including another 2013 model (UN40F5500), and 2 that are much older TVs, but not work on the newest, top of the line model. Blaming this one on the TV, and not Google since the device works elsewhere. However, it's not a deal breaker, especially since the Chromecast is $35 and the TV is $2,400. Just would have been nice if it worked like it does on my other TVs. Plus, it makes me wonder if there are other things I'll want to plug in to the TV later and whether or not they would work too.Buzzing:One of the many complaints I saw on the 2012 plasmas was buzzing, and was a big reason I waited for the 2013s. I talked with friends with plasmas made from various other manufactures, and asked if their plasmas had a faint/loud buzz to it. Had a mixed bag of answers. I also read many reviews for the 2013 Samsung plasmas that said they didn't hear any buzz. Tried listening for the buzz in stores, but didn't (and didn't really expect to given the noise level in stores). So rolled the dice and hoped my TV wouldn't buzz. Within hours of having my TV on for the first time, I noticed it. It was soft enough that with sound on at normal levels, you wouldn't hear it. If the TV was off, it wouldn't buzz. It was just if the volume was muted, or very soft, it was noticeable. For myself, I have many reasons I mute the TV, and every time the buzz plagued my ears. I thought maybe it would just be me, slightly amplifying it in my head because of my fear from reading so many bad reviews about buzzing. So I didn't say anything to anyone, and just waited to see if anyone would say something. Sure enough, first time the TV was muted, my wife asked me if the sound was normal. A couple days later, she commented again how much she hated the buzzing. My thoughts were confirmed. I talked with Samsung about it, they said some buzzing is normal, but when I told them I could hear it sitting 8-10 feet away, they too admitted it's louder than it should be. They said there were some picture settings that sometimes affect the buzzing - brightness and contrast. I didn't want to hurt the picture quality, but for troubleshooting purposes, I adjusted the setting up and down as requested, and still buzzed. They said it could be a loose cable. I unplugged everything except the power cable, still buzzed. They asked if I was at high altitude. Dallas, TX being at 430' I said no, but apparently high altitude can cause the TV to buzz. If you always have the sound on at normal levels, you probably won't be bothered by the buzz. And if that's you, then ignore the buzzing comments. If you occasionally have the TV on, but muted like me, I'd be hesitant. The buzzing is one reason, I'll probably stick to LEDs from now on.Heat:I'm not sure if it was normal or not, but walking past the TV, I always noticed a strong heat coming off the front of the TV. Just making note of that...Randomness:There were a few random things that happened with the TV, and I'm not sure what caused them. I couldn't duplicate it, but still something to note in case it happens to anyone else:-One time the TV made a few loud tonal sounds, as if it was having a hard time processing the audio (which by the way I have output through optical). It lasted no more than 5 seconds, but several different tones, and then the TV just turned off on its own. I turned it back on soon after, and everything seemed to be okay. It only happened once.-Randomly, a quick flash would appear, almost like part of the picture from a frame was missing. It would only be in one part of the screen, the rest of the frame would be fine, and it was so quick it was almost like a blink. I think this might have only happened while watching Netflix, but could not pinpoint it to that, and might have happened elsewhere. If it was Netflix, then maybe there was an issue receiving or processing over the connection (but it didn't buffer, so not sure about that). There's also the possibility that something was wrong with the TV in general.After 2 weeks, I felt I had enough time to figure out if I should keep the TV or send it back. I decided to return it, and Amazon was very helpful. The return service even took the TV off the stand, and re-boxed it. In general, the picture quality was very good. The added bells and whistles were not needed except the Smart Hub Apps. The buzzing, heat, and random issues listed above ultimately made me doubt the purchase. After spending $2,400 on the TV, I wanted to be sure I loved the TV, and not just live with it. I'm still a Samsung fan, and will be replacing it with UN65F8000 very soon. Hopefully, better luck there. It won't fix the problem of the remote or some of the added features (voice control, RVU, etc), but that's okay. I just won't use the Samsung Remote or the quirky features. If it doesn't buzz, picture quality is good, doesn't have random issues, doesn't overheat, and maybe even compatible with Chromecast, I think I'll be happy. The extra 5 inches doesn't sound so bad either. We'll see...", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung PN60F8500", "Author": "George J. Abdallah", "ReviewID": "R2WYZEHFCDCIQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After literally two months of research and going back and forth between the PN60F8500 and the Panasonic ZT series, I ended up going with this set because after all of the reviews and all of the time spent checking out both sets in person, unless you live in a dark cave, the Samsung just has better and fuller color. The ZT does have a smidge better black level but it's hardly noticeable unless you're in a pitch black room.Regardless, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Glad I passed up on the Panny and the 4K sets because after having this set professionally calibrated, I can say that it's the best TV I've laid my eyes on (except for the brand new OLEDs, outrageous pricing however).I was extremely satisfied with my Samsung LN52A750, and Samsung has impressed me even further with this set.If you are like me, going back and forth between sets and also unless you're a Panasonic fanboy or spend the majority of the time watching TV where it is extremely dark with no glare whatsoever, you won't be sorry with this set. Personally, I don't have a brand preference. I just thought this particular TV looked better picture-wise and aesthetically.***UPDATE***As of 10/10/2013: Still loving this set, so much so that I purchased another 64 inch set!After having this set for about two months, my eyes have adjusted to it and now it looks \"normal\".  What I mean by that is now when I look at someone else's TV it's unbelievably different than looking at my 8500. You truly see how great of a set this is once you're adjusted to it.After the latest firmware update there were no more \"quirks\". Before, it randomly reset itself twice and the HDMI-ARC setting was a little jittery. I have this set hooked up to a Samsung HW-F550 via HDMI. No problems since the update however.*** Additionally, as I believe others have mentioned, you can get the non-touch remote for this set 100% FREE from Samsung's website. It's infinitely better than the touchpad based remote. The touchpad one is now sitting in a cabinet.

I'm a big tv and home theater enthusiast and i've been waiting for this years new plasma tvs since samsung made significant improvements.this tv is outstanding in all aspects. I've been doing a lot of research and side by side comparison between led and plasma before buying a new tv and this plasma definitely kicks butt!. Why get an led?? plasma is even cheaper!!!aesthetics- this tv is gorgeous, slimmer bezel, all metal with brushed aluminum makes this tv very unique and elegant, all other brands just look alike and the sony and panasonic gorilla glass is pretty redundant, not that attractive, and looks cheap.  Solid construction all around compared to the cheap plastics that shows glue on edges of leds. Narrow profile.performance- this plasma performs very well, big improvement over last year's e8000 series, quad core makes performance very fast accurate and smooth compared to panasonic's dual core.picture quality-  holly smokes!!! obviously plasma over led hands down!!!! richer colors, natural skin tones and deep blacks, not purples like leds. this plasma has a ton of brightness. i have mine set at 60% and contrast at 60% making this tv as bright as led. i have not gotten the chance to test the 3d yet!! but the picture is unreal. Plasmas are better than ever!!CONS: -slight buzzing which i understand is normal on all plasma tvs especially when displaying bright screen colors but it's not overwhelming. you must have the tv in mute and get really close to either top corners of the tv in order to hear it. But once you have a little volume then you won't hear it at all.  -i wish samsung made the camera adjustable instead of a straight forward setting. not everyone will have the tv at the same height!!!For those of you who are experiencing louder than normal buzzing and can hear it beyond a couple of feet try putting some light pressure on and off in the back panel, top left or right corner and hear the difference. if the loud buzzing resides to normal then the screws that hold the circuit boards by the power supply are not tight enough. you can make that adjustment at your own risk!!! or you can call a tech to do it for you. other than that i HIGHLY recommend this tv to anyone.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "For me, this is the best TV currently available.", "Author": "PTO", "ReviewID": "R1FUIQXD5WLC0B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own a Kuro, had the VT60 for a month and now have the 8500.  The Kuro is still spectacular but it is 50\" and I wanted a larger TV.  I bought the VT60 based on expert reviews.  The blacks were very good as was the sound but for me, there was always something missing.  I went to BB to compare the two and watched the VT and 8500 side by side for quite a while.  It is always hard to make judgments based on what you see in a store but to me the 8500 had much whiter whites and also a lot more detail.  I figured this was just a settings issue.  I ended up returning the VT because of the fan noise.  It doesn't bother some people but I couldn't ignore it.  When the dialog was quiet, I could always hear fan noise and I started waiting for it.  Panasonic has since come up with a potential fix that seems to work for some people but it seemed ridiculous that I would need to have my brand new TV worked on for a fix that may or may not work.That was more than enough to convince me to return the VT for an 8500.  Now the 8500 is not perfect either.  The first one I got had an issue where it would flash a duplicate issue on the screen when Black Optimizer was on.  Samsung's response to my inquiry about this was just to not use the feature.  That was helpful.  So once again, I had to box up another 64\"+ TV and send it back and my wife let me know how much she enjoyed that!To me, the 8500 is the most complete TV currently available.  Once the settings are adjusted, it has blacks that are just a touch below the VT and the difference is not noticeable in most circumstances.  It has brightness that allows it to do well in non man cave environments unlike most plasmas.  I didn't realize what I was missing with the VT and Kuro until I got the 8500.  The detail it produces is amazing.  The TV is much more of a smart TV than the VT.  The apps are much better and it's ability to interact and control a cable or sat box is cool.  I also like the small things like the LED power light is off when watching TV.  The VT has a glowing red light when you were watching the TV which was annoying with no option to turn it off.Now the 8500 isn't perfect either.  My first one had the black optimizer issue.  The sound isn't as good as on the VT. I haven't had much luck with voice commands but that was never very important to me.  People have reported buzz.  I can hear some if I turn sit  directly in front of the very middle of the screen and turn my head sideways.  This is not my normal TV viewing position so I never hear the buzz while watching TV which is very important after the VT fan noise.  All in all I am thrilled with the TV and its shortcomings are minor compared to its positive traits.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Anyone seen a pair of socks! Remarkable Picture", "Author": "C. James", "ReviewID": "R2ZKIMT778H2D1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:- Picture, just stunning!- Controls, outstanding control of every aspect of the picture- Smart Features great if you have a keyboard- Easy Set-up, it does most of the work- Integration with Home Theater receiver and STB- Built in WiFi and Wired Ethernet- 4 HDMI, 3 USB, 1/1 Component/Shared CompositeCons:- Need a stand as wide as the TV, most of the weight falls on the last 4\" of each end (5 feet)- Internal speakers - this is pretty much the case with any large TV these days- Need a very wide stand, looks good but needs a stand to fit the full width if not wall mounted.- Annoying error screen when switching sources to tell you there is no HDMI signal (can be bypassed at the cost of other features)Overview:The overall 5 rating is based 90% on picture quality, the rest to me is a small part of the decision,  if I add in Sound from the internal speakers and Smart Features and other measures it drops to a 4+,so an outstanding TV. This 64F8500 is at the top of the game in picture quality and while it offers nearly endless tuning options, you are just fine with your eyes and the basic picture controls we all know well;  Brightness, Contrast, Sharpness, Color, and Tint, and Cell light. The good news is that out of the box you get a stunning picture, and using your preference and eyes you can tune it to your liking just fine so no need to be worried about most of the settings, the factory values are very good. Most are going to be very happy with  some basic adjustments and that will be the last time you need to bother, more on calibration later. When you add in the smart features with the great picture it is hard not to have a smile on your face unless you are watching a sad movie.I have mine on an AV stand, it is not wall mounted but can be with a standard bracket and various styles. I had to get a new stand as this needs to be 6\" side, most of the weight sits on the last 4\" of each end and I don't think it would do well without the ends resting on the stand. The other option is the wall mount it, it has a standard mount so you can buy most any style.Overall this is by far the best Plasma TV I have owned or any kind of TV for that matter, this brings together the best of LCD/LED and Plasma in one set and should hold me over the few years it will take for OLED to get its act together, I saw no material advantage in OLED, not that you can get a 64/65 inch yet. Not only are the prices too high, they still have a lot of bugs to work out, OLED is only for true early adaptors who enjoy the early flaws and all and have a healthy budget.Picture Quality (PQ): 5This to me is the first and most important measure. Out of the box the picture is just plain stunning before messing with any settings and there are 4 picture \"modes\", 6 if you are a little adventurous and care to dive into the \"forbidden\" service menu, the 4 you get are: Dynamic, Standard, Relax, and Movie. Dynamic is typically for use with game consoles or PC's hooked to the TV and on some animated movies like Shrek it can really punch the picture up. Standard covers typical TV viewing, Relax tones things down a little for less eye strain that too bright of a picture can cause (common in LED/LCD sets), and finally Movie which is how Ron Howard thinks it should look :) - this is supposed to align to how the producers wanted it to look. If Ron ever drops by it is nice to know you are all set. Seriously though Movie sets a base line for true reference standards.I found the F8500 Picture after an a few minor adjustments to be as good as the Pani ZT60  for everything from Blu-Ray movies to HDTV from cable, both are just great. There are two places where I think there is a noticeable difference, and to my surprise they were both on the Samsung. The F8500 seems to hold its color better in a room lit well enough to read in, and far better in a sun lit room.  I also liked 3D on the Samsung more than one the ZT60, seemed a lot more vivid.As to the overall picture, you get deep blacks to bright whites, the best whites I have ever seen on a Plasma, true white. The colors look true and I measure that by them not standing out (except where they are supposed to), red things should look red and not make you notice it if you know what I mean. Flesh tones are outstanding, again they look like they should to the point that it does not call your attention to it, they just look right.When watching a blu-ray under darkened conditions the F8500 really starts to show its stuff, when they say a picture tell a thousand words that is an understatement when it comes to the picture and I traded up from a top of the line 50\" Panasonic Plasma. The subtle details add a lot to the movies, things in the shadows to spectacular explosions are the best I have ever seen. As for things like dealing with on-screen motion I have found this to be the best set I have owned so far still not perfect but the best to date.Bottom line on picture quality out of the box just does not get much better than the Samsung F8500 series the colors are vibrant without looking cartoonish, the whites are the best I have ever seen on a Plasma set (finally watched a hockey game where the ice was white and not grayish or bluish and approached that of LCD/LED sets, the black depth allows the subtle shadows to show themselves adding the kind of richness and depth usually only seen at a theater.3D PQ: 5++If you are a 3D fan then I would not even consider the Pani it is just too dark to really get the full impact of 3D, the Samsung being brighter has produced the first 3D I have been willing to watch on my home TV, it is near theater quality, it will make you duck! The TV comes with 4 pairs of 3D glasses and additional glasses are reasonably priced. I watched Star Trek - Into the Darkness in the theater 3D and later on the F8500 and WOW is all I can say, while not quite as deep as in the theater I was awed by it, and the most amazing part is how the effects are so clean it does not distract from the movie but adds to as it should.PQ Calibration: 5There are three levels I break picture calibration into, basic settings (brightness, Contrast, Sharpness, Color , Tint and Cell Light) adjusting the picture with live content, ie watching TV, this is how most people adjust the picture, then an intermediate level where it is calibrated by eye with a calibration disc like the Disney WOW disc that gives you the test patterns and advice on how they should look and what \"knob\" you need to turn,  and finally the professional calibration that runs from 300 - 600 buck and attempts bring it to a reference standard. The F8500 is a 5 for all three, I did use the Disney WOW on mine after 300 hours of running the TV, but this is not required, I just like to know I am at a good starting point before adjusting to what I like.Sound Quality: 3 (internal speakers) / 5 hooked to a home theaterThe sound is very acceptable out of the internal speakers to watch most TV, but is far from ideal, this really takes a surround bar at minimum or surround AV receiver to pull the best sound out and unlike the professional picture calibration talk, it really does require using external speakers and an AV receiver if you want the sound quality to match the picture, however if you start with just the internal speakers or if you are like me and do not always want to fire up the home theater system, this set has sufficient sound quality to enjoy most TV. For sports and movies it really does pay to add the external audio, it truly makes a noticeable difference. This is the same with any TV, so it is not Samsung specific.Smart Features: 3+This has a ton of smart features and are of the same quality and diversity as any TV in this price range, so if you want to stream movies from Amazon or Netflix or a pile of other streaming services you are all set. The Samsung comes with wireless Ethernet or wired, I found the wireless WiFi to be pretty darn good, watching HD movies from a streaming sources was very good, no lags, artifacts, pauses, blocking or other noise. This depends more on the quality and performance of your wireless router and internet service than on the TV. The best connection for streaming is still a wired Ethernet connection if you can swing it and there are a number of ways you can do this without running wire if you are a little adventurous.Once adding a keyboard (about 30 bucks) the browser goes from virtually useless to acceptable but this is the early days and it will get better over time with firmware upgrades. Bottom line, do not count on this to become you mainstream browser.Count on getting a Bluetooth keyboard if you want to get the most out of the smart features, the remote is only practical for very limited use. One downside, not all Smart Apps work with and external keyboard, I just don't use them, the on-screen keyboard or smart pad is too awkward to be usable.Key smart features include:- Things like, YouTube Facebook, Twitter and Skype that works with the built in camera, apps include a number of streaming services like Amazon Video, NetFlix, and several more, these are app paid services, so you get the app for free but the movies generally cost you (except Amazon Prime of course) Other apps include a mix of paid and free things like Weather, News, games, sports and such. If you use the full TV functions you have a full TV guide and you can play content from a USB stick for Photos, Videos & Music: Play back photo, video, and music. Has a pretty cool camera app, nice field of view.- The DLNA is OK and on par with most DLNA clients but it allows you to stream from any DLNA source you might have, I have it hitting my HTPC for movies and other stuff we have recorded using Windows Media Center and a tuner card. If you have a large collection of movies and tv shows the navigation is pretty rough.- Android App, is very hot, if you have a smart phone or tablet then you can control the TV via a free Samsung app, I use it with a Samsung 10\" Tab that came with the TV and both Samsung's free App but also a few free/shareware apps. A cool feature is the ability to push whatever you are watching from the TV to the tablet or phone, and keep watching from there while you leave the room for whatever reason, then you don't have to pause the show to wait for someone to come back. It does an amazing job pushing the show to the tablet, very smooth and sounds great. There is also a number of cool remote app.Smart Control Features -Controlling the TV by Voice commands and/or motion gestures I put in the novelty section, yes they sort of work and are very impressive when showing this off to family and friends but on a practical level I found them worse than useless, so turned them all off and only use them now when I am doing a gee-wiz demo for folks. Voice triggers too easily, misses too often and after a while feels like it does when trying to direct a 3 year old on what to do, you repeat yourself a lot. The motion controls are just insane in my view, some may like them but I just can't bring myself to sit there flapping my arms around to control the TV, seriously what are folks thinking... The one gesture I am really good at is not very polite and it does not understand it and when it does it turns the volume up :)Operation: 4 (not counting smart control)I measure operation by ease-of-use, when I want to watch TV I like things simple. Samsung now ships this with 2 remote controls, the little Smart Remote and a big ole conventional remote, I prefer the conventional remote for most of what I use but the smart remote is pretty slick also and often best when using the smart features, I just happen to like a real button for selecting and controlling common functions. The on-screen menus are the best I have ever used, they are generally very well placed and sized, as well as ordered in a way puts the things you want most often one click away. It loses a point on the keyboard deal, given that many of the smart features I like are nearly unusable with the on-screen keyboard or gestures on the keypad, I think one needs to be included, sort of like a new car delivered with no tires.This will interface with your cable/Sat set top box (STB) using the included IR (Infra-Red) blaster that you position in front of your STB, I found this to be very reliable but like any IR blaster will sometimes be a little flakey. I would say that it hits 95% on the first try and the 5% it missed it does not do anything, which is good, this is with a Comcast STB.If you are using an AV receiver for your audio the Samsung will integrate with most newer receivers and allow you to control it thought the Samsung remote, at least for volume and channel, offering a simpler operation experience in not having to juggle remotes, but don't count on getting rid of the AV receiver remote, it is not that complete. You can put the STB remote in a drawer if you use the IR Blaster that is included, so one less thing to mess with while watching TV.It can be a little flakey when using the integrated control to the receiver, I use it with a Sony STR-DA1800 and 99% of the time it is fine, 1% of the time it gets confused and turns off the receiver, or will no longer adjust the volume, but for me it is rare.Final Thoughts:I would easily recommend to friends and if I had to make the decision again today, this is the set I would buy to hold me over until they get the issues worked out with OLED. Now after having this for a couple of months I find I never think about the settings, rarely even change picture mode (which is very easy).My Home Theater:Samsung 64F8500 / Sony STR-DA1800 AV Receiver / Infinity 7.1 Surround Speakers / Panasonic Blu-Ray BDT-210 / Comcast HDTV Set-Top / HTPC computer", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow...

I never really looked at Plasmas because of the inherent flaws... burn in, screen reflectivity, and just not very bright.  I decided a new TV was in order a few months ago, so I began researching the current offerings in \"Big\" televisions.  I made up my mind to go with the Sharp 70 or 80 757.  I went to my local Best Buy to see it in person (they had the 857 on the floor).  The size was good and the picture was ok, but what really jumped out at me was a smaller plasma unit... Back to the internet to look into things a bit more thoroughly...After many more hours, I decided that a great picture was more important to me than just a huge screen.  I thought about the Panasonic VT or ZT, but the Samsung F8500 won my heart because of its ability to be very bright (and because all my HDTVs have been Samsungs which I've been very happy with).I received my 64F8500 a couple weeks ago and have been amazed by the picture on this thing.  It's really incredible.  I have only done some basic tweeking using settings from professional reviews and I can honestly say that I've never seen such an incredible picture... Wow!  I'm going to play with the settings using my Spears & Munsel disc once the display is broken in (200 hours I guess).I didn't purchase this set for the smart features, camera, or 3D, but that stuff is all fine.  I was actually kinda blown away with the 3D from my 3D Blu Rays, though.  Pretty cool.  It comes with 2 remotes - the one with the mouse is the only one I use and I think its great.  Very easy to use and get where I want to be.  I still use my Dish Network remote for changing channels although the Samsung remote allows you to navigate channel menus from Dish, Direct TV and more.All in all, I am Mega-Happy with this purchase.  Now the picture is as good as the sound of my system when watching Blu Ray movies (I have a pretty awesome audio setup with Axiom's, an Onkyo 818 and dual 1000W subs).  I used to say the best part of Blu Ray movies was the sound... now it's the whole package!!", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "incredible picture / a few bugs", "Author": "anthony c kelley", "ReviewID": "RKY2XOLHA93", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off let me say this set has an amazing picture. I swapped it for an older Panasonic TC-P50V10, remember the top of the line panny in 2009 that had issues with black level increasing with age... Turned me off to Panasonic, but with the demise of plasma I figured I needed an upgrade before it was too late. I looked at all the offerings and this set just bowled me over. I won't get into the great Samsung VS Panasonic debate, to me it's really a matter of preference. I liked the contrast on this screen and the bright whites, to my eye it gives the image more definition and pop, and while I'm not a huge fan of 3-D I played around with it and the effect was second to none. The set is also great looking, I like that the bezel blends into the screen, very understated, it's all about whats on the screen; no bright chrome or shiny plastic to detract from the picture. The blacks are superb and the overall picture is truly amazing, it makes the 2009 VT10 look downright washed out.Theres a lot of talk about the remote on this tv, it should be noted that my set came with both the bluetooth touchpad remote as well as a standard full-size IR remote, so if you're not a fan of the touchpad you can swap for a more traditional device, it should also be noted that if you don't have the IR remote samsung will provide one free of charge with this set (see their website). I actually really like the  new remote design, it's easy to use with the smartTV functions and I thought quite intuitive, you can use the touchpad to trace in numbers to change the channel (gimmicky but cool) and access lesser used commands via an onscreen extension of the remote. There is a DVR button on the remote but accessing things like FF and REW is a bit tricky. Overall I give the new remote a B+. As for gesture and voice control.... again, a bit gimmicky but both work, the voice search feature is actually a great aspect of the system and makes it super simple to do a cross platform search of movies and TV.I'm sure the speakers suck, I never even tried them out and I'm not sure why they're a consideration at this price point and size, I'd prefer they just deleted them all together if it meant they could make the set even smaller. There's a lot of complaints about \"buzzing\" I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary, and certainly nothing that I would find irritating, the fan from my PS3 is considerably louder than any noise this set is putting out, I've also been reading that the buzzing (and heat output) subsides after a few hundred hours of use with this set, so perhaps it's just a temporary side effect of the break in?I should point out that I am having a few issues with my set, and I'm hoping that it's just a matter of figuring out the right set-up with my AV system etc... The first is a known bug, when you calibrate this set and you turn off the cinema smooth feature it defaults and turns  dejudder processing to on(even though it says it's off) I couldn't figure out why things were looking so strange (I for one HATE the dejudder look) you have to go into settings and turn dejudder back on and then off again to defeat it.. seems like a big oversight as I'm guessing most people will have this set calibrated or do it themselves. My second issue is a sound issue, and it may be due to the ARC HDMI, I use my AV receiver as a switcher for my components and have the AV connected to the TV with an HDMI in the ARC input (so the TV only has one input coming from the receiver) my AV is ARC compatible and the tv remote is able to control the power and volume which I really like BUT when I turn the system on i don't get any sound from my cable box, if I launch an app (like netflix), then quit out of the app and go back to the cable box I get sound. Not sure if it's an issue with the ARC or a funny software bug, but it's irritating. I called customer service but that was about as much help as calling my grandmother. So if you're using this in a setup with ARC compatible components or you're using an HDMI controller to make use of the Samsung remote, you may run into trouble.This set is hands down the best picture I've encountered, I don't think plasma will live to see another update after 2014 so if you want to get the best possible picture available right now I would seriously consider this tv. Hopefully in 5 years time the tech will have surpassed what is currently available, and at an affordable price.

"RZC2Y983GSIA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsung F8500 Smart Plasma HDTV after a considerable amount of research.After reading over a dozen reviews from professional tech web sites that tested this latest Samsung flagship model,and many other online reviews giving this set 5 stars,I made the purchase on Amazon.The reviews read \"Stunning,the brightest plasma set ever produced\",\"The best HDTV of the year\",\"One of best televisions we've ever reviewed\",\"Absolutely awesome\",\"Amazing deep blacks and accuracy of color\",\"Breathtaking\",\"Clearly one of the best 1080P sets ever manufactured\",\"Power packed plasma shines brighter\" and \"Easily the best HDTV that Samsung has ever produced\" are just a few of the quotes from the many reviews.Along with winning the Value Electronics 2013 Flat Panel Shootout in a closely fought battle with two Panasonic flagships.I was a little skeptical that this set could measure up to all the hype.After receiving this HDTV,I can totally understand all of the rave reviews.To put it simply,the picture quality is really beyond stunning.Superb color accuracy,amazing rich contrast,inky deep blacks,breathtaking true whites and a very bright display.Motion blur is virtually non-existent.Cable content and internet streaming on this set in high definition is nearly flawless.I have not experienced any buzz sound from my set,that is often associated with plasma sets.The set is dead quiet.Image retention has also been non-existent.For those who desire a set with an amazing picture,although stick with LED sets for fear of worry about these issues,I have had zero problems.Every aspect of this set has exceeded my expectations.I use it with a Tivo Premier XL4 DVR and Oppo Blu Ray player,and the results are amazing.The Panasonic flagship plasma sets are also top rated,and have great reviews,although I chose the Samsung for it's ability to have an amazing bright display,one of the shortcomings of many plasma sets.Although from reading the many reviews,you can't go wrong with either the Samsung or Panasonic plasma flagship models this year.It is an excellent year for plasma technology.If you are considering purchasing the Samsung F8500,I believe that you will not be disappointed.I am confident that this set will amaze you too.UPDATE:  July 2013- I have had my Samsung F8500 plasma HDTV for one month.The set has performed flawlessly for the duration.I have not experienced any buzzing sound and zero image retention.It has been a month of high definition bliss.The picture quality has been gorgeous.From the most beautiful rich colors,the most inky blacks,true whites and a stunning bright high contrast display,this HDTV continues to be stunning.Several friends have also viewed the set,and all have commented that the picture quality was by far the best image they have ever seen.The only downside of the set is that it does run a bit hot and create some heat.I guess a minor side effect of the super contrast display and bright screen.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "tim", "ReviewID": "R1VJV3GGDM5GH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i've only had this tv a day, but so far i'm happy i got it.  now i'm a huge panasonic fan, and still think they have the better picture.  i really wanted the zt60, but the samsung had a few specs that fit me, plus i don't like that panasonic bailed on plasmas.  since i'm not a panny fanboy, getting samsung wasn't hard.  it's def an awesome picture, i can't say that the slim improvement the zt would be over the f8500 would really matter to me.  the thing gets super bright.  i accidentally turned off eco mode and almost blinded myself.  i don't expect to need all that brightness, but it's good to know it's there or i can turn it up if i got the shades up for whatever reason.  it's probably a polarizing feature, but i gotta say, i really like the stand.  i'm gonna mount to existing wall mount once i get m8 bolts, but for now it's on stand.  it's wide, but i think it looks very cool.  the remote is also extremely cool.  i think it's connected with bluetooth so line of sight isn't an issue(can also hook up other bt devices to tv, but i didn't try that yet).  very minimalistic, which for me is more of a con.  it does work very well, and it is quite handy for basic functions and for navigating through smart hub.  but for play/pause or changing channels, no.  i'll use my harmony anyway, but it's worth noting.  the built in wifi is great too, and it's even on the ac standard.  hooked up quick and easy and made updating firmware very easy.  includes 4 pairs of 3d glasses, which is nice.  they're comfortable enough.  smart features worked fine, i only tested youtube.  this is where remote lacks, when searching, but a bt keyboard would solve that easy enough.[update: it didn't really.  i connected it and it works fine as a mouse and using arrow buttons, but doesn't seem to have same functionality as regular keyboard on a computer.  at least when dealing with apps.  browser is better, if you ever use that.]cons:  as mentioned, the remote.  though it looks cool and performs great, it's ease of use is lacking.  sound sucks, but using onboard sound is offensive to this tv.  i consider onboard sound only there for audible cues when setting up tv or testing or whatever, not for actual viewing.  so for me i don't care.  voice interaction didn't seem to work for me.  it's supposed to do real speech, but didn't recognize anything for me.  now i don't have tv fully hooked up yet, nor will i use voice ever, so i'll test again when it's all hooked up.  if it doesn't work, i won't care anyway.[update: it works now, just had to finish setting up smart features]UPDATE (2/6/14):  i'm gonna do updates as i remember things.  one of the things i remember being an potential issue for some is the buzz that plasmas all have.  i remembered to check the other day randomly, which obviously shows it's not an issue.  i walked up to tv and could only hear a buzz if i muted the sound.  so it's not an issue, for me.  volume will vary from person to person, but i don't think it should be a deal breaker.  even muted, i don't even think i could hear it in my normal sitting position, which is probably about 10' away or so.i also removed the stand and mounted the tv on my previously existing wall mount.  fyi for everyone, it takes m8 bolts.  my kit didn't have any that big, hence the delay mounting.  home depot had em for just a couple bucks.  i think mine were 35mm, which was too long without any spacer, but my kit did have spacers to use.  if you don't, and don't have anything to use as spacer, get shorter bolts or you won't be able to tighten them down all the way.  just 1/2\" or so would be plenty, depending on thickness of mount plate.i finished setting up the smart features and setup the ir extender.  i like it.  i was worried about the ir because my cable box is just an inch or so from front of ent center, so wasn't sure i could get ir far enough in front to work.  but i have it sitting just ahead of the box, not even aiming at it or anything, actually off it's side, and it works perfectly.  i can even access my recorded shows.  i'm not sure if i can set recordings and all that, but i don't really have any intention to use it for that.  my shows are all setup. and the remote works without any mroe setup than is done with smart features, no codes or anything.and i'm really impressed at how easy it is to play files straight from tv.  i've loaded music, videos, and even 3d movies onto my jump drive and the tv played em all.  i've always had issues with devices not playing this format or that format, not here.ran into issue when trying to set up my settings.  it seems that movie mode is the only default mode that can edit 10pt white balance.  all the other it's not available.  so if you plan to enter some yourself from the web, you'll have to unlock the cal modes.  which if you're in the same situation as i am without standard remote, you'll have to program a universal to get into it since touch remote doesn't have required buttons.(update: i programmed my universal and accessed service menu, and i totally screwed up tv.  fyi, DO NOT go into the ADC/WB menu and especially don't do the hdmi cal, that screwed up everything.  if you do, download a 1080p checkerboard to put on tv and redo it.  to turn on cal modes, go into options(i think, if not there check other submenus), then expert, then n/d adj, turn that on, then select all for sources.  that'll add cal-day and cal-night picture modes and allow you to change all settings.)", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "All the Hype is ACTUALLY true!", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "R3SICBXCJJ3TZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually upgraded to this flat panel from a Samsung PN51F5500, and the difference is as clear as day. Firstly, let me say that the F5500's only issue was decreased performance in relation to ambient light and the brightness factor during daytime watching. Other than that, in a dim/dark room, it performed admirably.To begin, I honestly didn't think the F8500 would really be as amazing as described by CNET's David Katzmaier, but my doubt was severely misplaced. Regarding style, it is one of the most beautifully designed flat panels I've seen in a while. Sure, the LED TV's look futuristic, modern and minimalist, no arguments there. However, given that this is a plasma  - a slim & trim one - and given all the 'techy guts' packed into its small frame, Samsung has truly created a work of art. Many people may not be fans of flat panels with bezels, but it doesn't get better than this. It's a beautiful combination of glass and metal, of which the stand must certainly be the pinnacle of its design. The illusion of seamless metal works wonderfully, and the gunmetal/graphite tint of the frame/stand looks handsome and elegant. This color perfectly compliments the deep black, anti-reflective screen.Regarding peripherals, in this case the 3-D glasses and remote (only touch pad version included), there is room for improvement. Obviously, as you'll no doubt read in many professional reviews, the 3-D glasses are probably one of the weaker links in the chain. Yes, they work, and yes, the 3-D effect is amazing, but the idiosyncrasy in craftsmanship is clearly noted when comparing the glasses to the panel. They just don't match, and it's apparent; I wish Samsung would've created 3-D glasses worthy of the TV they accompany. The remote, on the other hand, is very well manufactured. The battery leaf on the back sits flush against the top half and there are no noticeable gaps. The touch pad itself works very well, is very responsive, and feels quality made. The voice recognition software worked surprisingly well out of the box and didn't require any special tinkering or additional honing. Being that the remote is connected to the panel via Bluetooth, I had no issues using the remote in a couple of different rooms, albeit a maximum of 25-30 ft from the panel. Given the money this panel is selling for and the fact that it's designed to be a high-end model, I also wish Samsung would've included their wireless keyboard.Regarding the SmartHub, it responds very quickly - due entirely to the quad core processor. The touch pad sensitivity and responsiveness makes for a very pleasant experience when navigating. I've used a few Apps, nothing extensive. From the few that I've touched, everything seems to be working fine. Buffering/Processing happens quickly, half of which depends on your connection speed. Regarding initial set up, the process is quick and painless assuming you have your cable top box set up and your wireless network set up. The only issue I have is inputting information, which takes forever with the 'swipe'n'click' process (keyboard would've been a welcome addition here). It's also an issue when entering credentials for online TV/Movie services provided on the App page.Regarding Gesture Control, I have to say, it's pretty neat...but that's where it ends. There is no reason to use this function since there is an included remote. It's a gimmick feature Samsung threw in to sweeten the pot, but in reality, not very utilitarian. Maybe with the upcoming Evolution Kit, there will be improved software to remove glitches, and an actual need/use for this feature (free games in the Samsung SmartHub???).Regarding Picture Quality, the hype is a reality. I used the recommended settings (with minor tweaks of my own) Mr. Katzmaier calibrated his F8500 with, and I'm very happy with the result. Even so, out of the box, the 'Movie' mode is darn near spot-on. So, unless you're a certified ISF Calibrator, the average consumer (i.e. Me) won't have to make many changes, if any, at all. 'Dynamic' mode is eye-searingly bright, 'Standard' mode is a more toned-down version of 'Dynamic', 'Relaxed' mode seems to be some variation of an eco-friendly setting, and of course I already mentioned 'Movie' mode. One thing that has been highly touted concerning this panel is its ability to put out light, and you better believe it. In my mind, it seems brighter than many LED's simply because of the deep inky blacks it maintains while still emitting the kind of light it does. The contrast ratio is ridiculously high, and makes the picture POP like I've never before seen. In comparison to my friend's 50\" Pioneer Pro-101fd (Kuro), I'd venture to say that this panel very clearly outperforms what everyone deems the 'reference' standard. Sure, it could be my untrained, unrefined, amateur eye, but even so, I'd say ignorance is bliss in this instance! As many have already stated, watching normal TV (FiOS) is an absolute joy because the panel just makes everything look better (or worse, depending on what you're watching). I've had absolutely NO PROBLEM watching anything in broad, blazing day light. Just to be clear, I have a 18' x 10' window situated just to the left of my panel, facing east & unblocked, so sunlight streams in a big portion of the day (when I have the curtains opened, obviously). In testing the panel's picture quality, I used Planet Earth, Kung Fu Panda, the Pioneer Kuro's original demo, and the Samsung Plasma Demo.My wife, upon seeing the performance of the F5500 we originally had, commented that she'd never seen a clearer image on any TV (I told her to get out more, to which she responded, 'I do' and gave me a look, to which I responded 'Touche'). Now, when it comes to electronics/technology, she's unconcerned at best. For example, she can't tell the difference between standard definition and HD. Now, before we have anyone comment on my 'wife-bashing', I'm not, I'm just trying illustrate my point. When she saw the F8500 at work, as I was concurrently explaining to her how flipping awesome the panel was, she shushed me (big surprise there...no, seriously, big surprise) and says, 'Movie nights just got a whole lot better'. After I heard THAT, I KNEW, for a FACT, I DID NOT GO WRONG and at the same time felt SO PROUD OF HER!Can't wait to see/hear what'll happen when we upgrade to OLED or 4K UHD!!!In the meantime, hope this review helped those who may have been on the fence, or those on the lookout for a new panel.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Overall TV of 2013", "Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "R10KFN6S12L8VB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Spent about 7 months deciding which display to purchase and finally made my purchase in December. It basically came down to the F8500, ZT60, & F8000. The F8000 is pretty great for an edge lit LED, but suffers from common problems like viewing angles and black uniformity issues in low light conditions. As for the F8500 vs ZT60 both have strengths and weaknesses, both tv's are far from perfect as they both have flaws. It really comes down to a personal preference, saying one is clearly better than the other is a load of nonsense. For me I have no brand loyalty, I want the best tv I can afford when I'm in the market and could care less who's name is on the front.Why didn't I go with the ZT? Well the main reasons were the fact that I don't have a dedicated home theater room, I rarely watch movies in a completely black room, the ZT60 has had more problems with IR (both sets have it), the ZT had fan noise issues (a fix was made but still an issue on some sets), and finally price difference at the time of purchase. Although the ZT has these drawbacks it's a fantastic display when calibrated by a professional, just for me considering all factors the F8500 was the better all around set.Why the F8500? The room I have my F8500 in does have a sliding glass door, there is no direct sunlight shinning on the set, but there is a decent amount of ambient light in the summer. The filter on the F8500 is excellent at blocking out light as is the ZT's, but an area you will notice a difference is in how reflective the displays are. The ZT will reflect and produce more glare when you have the lights on in a room. This was a big factor in why I choose the F8500. The other big factor was that I could sit closer to the F8500 than the ZT and not see the pixels. As a result I would have had to sit farther away from the ZT as compared to the F8500 and with the way my room was laid out some seats could not be moved farther back to adjust for this. The smart app interface is another strong point for this panel, well designed and runs amazon instant flawlessly. This panel got a lot of praise for how bright it could get, but honestly I think the ZT gets bright enough for the majority of viewing environments.Some flaws of the F8500, probably the most common complaint is panel buzz. All of the F8500 have some to an extent, but some panels are noticeably louder than others so it's kind of luck of the draw. All plasmas do have some buzzing so if you are new to plasma it may take some time to adjust to it. Another flaw is it's rendering of blacks is not quite up to the ZT level, I think it's a minimal difference, but if I watched movies in a dedicated room with no lighting I would possibly have gone with the ZT.Overall the panels have different strengths and weaknesses, it's just a matter of choosing the correct one for the room it's going to be viewed in and which flaws will bother you the least. Having owned the F8500 51\" & 60\" & a 60\" ZT60 the F8500 60\" was the one I ended up keeping and I returned the others.One recommendation I do have is whether you chose a Panasonic ST/VT/ZT or Samsung F8500/F8000 get the display professionally calibrated by someone who is respected in the industry. These sets are capable of producing stunning images, but out of the box settings do not represent what they can truly do; you need a true professional to get them to that level.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great High End Home Theater TV", "Author": "Greggo", "ReviewID": "R3KLNZMOYLKHCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from one of the big box stores but wanted to post a review here.  I did lots of research on HDTV's before making my final purchase.  I wanted a high end TV and was willing to spend up to $3000 for it.  I read reviews on CNET, Sound & Vision, HDguru along with many customer reviews.  It was between this or the UN60F8000 LED LCD from Samsung.  I also considered the Panasonic plasmas.  I even considered the Samsung 4K set that's around the same price but read a review that stated 4K source material will not be readily available for 2-3 years.  I ultimately decided on the plasma due to the overall picture quality.  This is my main home theater display so I am very picky about picture quality.  I have a semi dark bonus room with one window.So far I have been very pleased with this set.  I used the following calibration settings from CNET to adjust the picture as soon as I turned it on.[...]Its a great looking set even when turned off.  My neighbor helped me carry this upstairs and get it on the stand ([...]Once we got it up he was impressed and said \"that is beautiful!\".These settings have been great.  I adjusted a little bit of the color for my PS3 input but other than that, the settings remain for all sources.  Movies from DirecTV look amazing.  We watched The Great and Powerful Oz and the colors were definitely impressive and showed off the 8500's chops very well.  I knew I'd made the right choice when my wife looked over at me and said, \"nice picture hun\".  She's not as picky as me when it comes to PQ, but having her comment on it meant a lot.  I played some NCAA football on the PS3 and did not notice a lag.  I'm not a hardcore gamer but will occasionally play some Call of Duty or Batman Arkham.  I'll update if there is noticeable lag in those games.  I also watch a lot of football and the Thanksgiving Day games looked superb on the set.  One note, I was watching basketball and the 3 point line on the court seemed to jitter some when the camera panned across the court.  I did not notice this with the lines on the football field.  There may be some type of smoothing setting that would help this, but I couldn't find it initially.  I don't watch basketball that much so it didn't bother me.I'm a techie guy so I haven't found the smart touch remote to be overly difficult to use.  It does take a little getting used to and I haven't taught my wife how to use it yet.  I have DirecTV and the remote easily programmed itself to control the set top box.  I can access my DVR and change channels with the smart touch remote.  I do still have to use my DirecTV remote for some of the guide and DVR functions however (I may update this if I find differently later).We pulled up some of the free 3D preview content in the Smart hub and donned the glasses (4 included) and watched several of these.  The wife and kids loved it and I can definitely see us purchasing some 3D movies for family movie night.  I doubt I'll go hardcore on the 3D, and this was not a real consideration in my purchase, but it is a pretty neat feature especially if you have kids.Bottom line if you are looking for a high end set and PQ is important to you, look no further.

But the living room TV was 13 years old (a 40\" Sony XBR - about the best made at the time), growing long in tooth and it was just time to retire it. So after much research and deliberation I decided to go for a TV that many considered the Best for my criteria - mainly picture. While Pioneer and now Panasonic did and will (respectively) exit producing a plasma TV line, Samsung has showed no such signal. Yes, eventually OLED will take over the high end TV market, but that date is moving out a year with each year that passes. Yes - the 4K TVs are out in very limited production - but where is the content? And anyone that believes that you can up-convert 2K to 4K and it is almost the same as original 4K content should contact me about a bridge I have for sale. (grin) The 4K demos look very sharp (using special content recorders) from 4 feet away. But from 12 feet, they are just like 2K. I digressed - but just to point out some of the reasons I went for this set instead of waiting.There are other excellent reviews that I will not try to repeat. I will just list the things that have impressed me most.Fantastic Picture - even in a naturally well lighted (no direct sun on the screen) Florida living room  At night is is even better!Color is well saturated (it is a plasma, right!) and exceptionally pleasingSharp as a tack! Probably better than my $8000 projector in the Home Theater.Plenty of inputs and outputs - 4 HDMI, 1 Optical digital audio out,  1 composite video & LR audio in, 1-RGB component Video in, 3 USB in.IR repeater out (put the emitter in front of your cable box for this Smart TV to control it unexpectedly well)Bluetooth remote - but also an IR sensor in the lower left corner. The IR repeater translates  the Bluetooth to IR to control my Comcast DVRA Very SMART TV - Samsung is usually regarded as the best interface in the \"smarts\" departmentMost of the electronics and connector plugs reside in a replaceable/upgradable module accessible from outside on the rear  Need the next version of HDMI next year - no problem.  You can not upgrade to 4K however, that is a different screen.Unexpectedly decent sound from rear facing speakers.  I still use a good sound-bar (I am used to the HT sound - not nearly a  replacement), but many will not need it.Very nice 3D picture if you want to wear the active (best kind) 3D glasses -  but there is not a lot of 3D content around and in my opinion, (all) the 3D glasses are a pain  - especially over another set of glasses.I did not get this because of the 3D. Any mid to high range set will just have it as it has a low add on cost.The set readily controls my Samsung 3D DVD Player and Yamaha YHT-S401BL Front Surround Home Theater System.The Question: Buy at Amazon or the local Big Box electronics store:In spite of me buying many dozens of things a year on Amazon, this was a concern. This was a BIG expensive TV. The price was the same - but Amazon had free shipping (instead of State Tax), and bonuses that would save me a couple of hundred bucks. The delivery time was about the same.  I figured I had aver a 90% probability that the set would be OK and Amazon was standing behind it, so decided to take a chance.  Amazon used a local third party company to bring in the unit and set it up to at demonstrate that it works. That means taking out of the carton, assembling it and turning it on, seeing video and hearing audio. If it does not do this, Amazon says to not accept it and have the installer pack it up and send it back, with him stating the reason for the return and Amazon will send you another one.  The set was very well packed in the Samsung box, which also served as the shipping container, so I was pretty confident it would be all right.  In my case, I had the old set removed, a new stand in place and the TV cable ready to plug in. The installer assembled the set (a few nuts and bolts to mount the set stand) and was happy to set it on my stand, plug in the cable and tune channels.  He would either take away the boxes or let me keep them. He did not store them in case there was a return situation that developed after he left. I kept them for a few weeks before they became too annoying in the garage. Your mileage may vary, but this turned out to be a very pleasant experience.The REMOTE:In spite of conflicting information on the web, the TV in the USA comes with only 1 very nicely made, small but hefty remote. The trouble is that it has only 16 buttons on it - which may seem like a lot until you look at your current remotes. E.g., there are NO NUMBER KEYS on the remote plus many other dedicated keys you usually have.  It has 3 indirect methods of entering numbers: Voice (does not work too well - I doubt you will use that), trace a number on a the 2x2 inch touch sensitive pad, or hit a \"More\" key that brings up on the TV screen, a rotation of 3 small panels, one of which lets you select numbers, again by swiping along the touch pad. There are not many places you use numbers other than channel numbers - but there you use them a lot since the TV is smart enough to do a decent job of controlling my Comcast DVR.I have been persevering to master this remote for 6 weeks, but I am about to give up and get a Samsung full 48 key conventional remote that will work with this set. I believe this one on Amazon will work:Samsung 3D TV Universal Remote Control (For use on all Samsung 3DTV's - PLASMA, LCD & LED).I am sure some young kids will have this control mastered in no time, but your's truly has too much experience to even thumb type on my smart phone well.In spire of the remote, would I buy this set again.

Bryant \"David B\"", "ReviewID": "RV0R818RHCL62", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I have to say that this is our first wide-screen flat-panel TV.  We previously had a very nice Sony 27 inch CRT model, neither HD nor wide screen, so this was a huge change for us.  I purchased this mainly on the basis of the Consumer Reports and CNet reviews.  My first choice was a similar Panasonic plasma TV, but I waited just a few days too long and the size we wanted had gone by the time I got around to ordering one.  (Panasonic shut down their production at the end of 2013.)  This is more expensive than the Panasonic would have been, but was also rated more highly by CR.The unit is indeed good-looking, at least as these things go.  The bezel is thin, and the stand is unusual looking and (we think) rather elegant looking.The picture is gorgeous!  We both feel that it is like seeing television and our favorite shows for the first time.  Much of it looks as if we were looking through a window with the actors right there on the other side of the glass.  Very impressive, indeed.  The two HD movies we watched were quite spectacular, with incredible detail and no motion artifacts that I noticed.  I have not tried to adjust the picture settings except for cranking up the brightness a bit.  I have not yet seen any need to change the default settings.But having said all that, I have to note that it is truly much less bright than a CRT or an LED/LCD screen.  We have it in our living room, with quite a bit of window light.  Since we do not watch much television during the daytime and since it is winter now and the sun sets early, the brightness has not been a problem.  I knew that a plasma TV would be less bright than an LCD, but I wanted to avoid the viewing angle restrictions of an LCD because of our seating arrangements, and I relied on the test reports saying that this is one of brightest plasma sets there is.  Plus I liked the reported picture quality, and I have not been disappointed.  My spouse has watched some Sunday morning talk shows and had no complaints.  But if we were to watch a movie in an afternoon I think I would want to close the draperies to get the best viewing.  We\u2019ll have to wait until summer to see how causal TV viewing is affected on a regular (daily) basis.The screen reflectivity is quite tolerable in my opinion.  A nearby lamp is often on when we watch and I hardly notice its reflection in the screen.I have noticed that the picture is noticeably dimmed when one looks at the TV from above, especially when close to it.  We have the set on a fairly low TV stand, not on the wall. This is not really an issue for any normal viewing positions.  I have read that the set Hs a feature to reduce glare from overhead lamps, and I suspect that accounts for the reduced visibility from a high angle.As CR noted, the TV audio quality is decent enough for routine viewing, not much worse than our old CRT TV.As for the features, it is certainly equipped with plenty.  The Wi-Fi worked well right from the start, no issues.  We have used a couple of web sites and had no problems, but have not tried anything challenging such as streaming a movie from the web.  The set has enough apps that we probably could eliminate the ROKU, whose services it seems to more or less duplicate.We have not yet tried the 3D but I look forward to it.Hookup -- The set has four HDMI inputs and a component input, and a digital optical audio output.  This allowed me to connect the Blu-ray player, the Roku and cable box to the HDMI inputs and feed my non-HD audio receiver with the TV digital audio output, thus avoiding the need for a new audio receiver.  (I feed a couple of older non-HD video devices through the receiver to the TV using the component input.)Remote controls -- The remote controls are an interesting pair.  One is a conventional remote, with buttons for most functions. The buttons are mostly quite large, with good clear legends, and available backlighting.  We have found it easy to operate the set and to navigate the menus using the regular remote or my existing universal remote.  The regular remote has a few buttons for a cable box, and the TV has an IR blaster to transmit signals to the cable box or other devices.  It was easy to select the correct cable service during the initial setup.  I did have a small problem in that the TV will turn on the cable box automatically, but does not turn it off.  I have not spent much time trying to troubleshoot this minor problem.The second remote is an elegant device, and sophisticated, and in theory is a universal remote, but I have found it too complex for convenient use.  It has a touch pad (like a PC) for web navigation and for many other functions.  This remote has but a few buttons, and depends on the touchpad plus some on-screen menus and a screen keyboard to control the TV or other devices.  Another feature is a microphone that can be used to command the TV.  I have tried this a few times but have (so far) found the voice control to be more frustrating than it\u2019s worth.  I have searched the on-line manual and help screens but have been unable to locate a comprehensive list of allowed spoken commands, so it\u2019s been a guessing game to learn what would work.  The other main problem is that the TV has occasionally popped up the voice command menu in the middle of a TV show or a movie, when we did nothing to request the menu.  My guess is that some bit of sound on the program triggered the pop-up menu.  The worst part is that the pop-up silenced the TV audio so you lose whatever is going on until you can kill the audio menu.  I went into the settings and disabled the audio command system to avoid similar incidents.The TV can also be controlled by hand gestures, but given my experience with the audio commands (plus little interest), I have not been tempted to tackle that.Overall, and aside from the peculiar universal remote and the audio command feature, we are delighted with this TV.  Most of our observations match those of the two reviews I read (CR\u2019s and CNet), with the exception that I did not think the audio was as bad as CNet did.  i give the unit four stars mainly because of the mediocre (but acceptable) audio, the strange second remote, and the problems we had with the audio commands.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy  with tv", "Author": "LEO58", "ReviewID": "R24JPLTXAXMLE9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received this tv on 4/4/2014 delivery was ok maybe I just expected more ...

I wouldn't say I'm a videophile, but I am fairly picky.  The picture lives up to expectations.  I'm glad I found a TV that could beat the picture of my old DLP.My experiences with the tv-It does buzz occasionally.  I don't know why, sometimes it doesn't buzz.  I'm 45, and have a home theater system and the only time I've heard it buzz was while the sound was muted.  It does seem that a brighter screen will increase the buzzing when it's actually buzzing.  I would say maybe 10% of the time when I mute the TV I hear the buzzing.I have no problem with the remote.  If you've worked a laptop track pad you can work the remote.  90% of the time I'm using my Harmony One universal remote anyway.  If I need to change settings or go into the smart hub I use the Samsung remote and the track pad does not hinder me in anyway.I do not use the TV guide or the feature that controls my DirecTV DVR.  I've got the universal remote handling my DVT, Blue-Ray, home theater system, and TV.  I'm used to that and it works just fine.I like the smart hub.  I haven't been all through it, but I use Netflix, Amazon Prime streaming, and HBO GO.  This is my first smart TV so this feature is an unexpected benefit.  Word of advice for home theater users, you might need an optical cable from the tv to your receiver to get sound.  I'm not up on audio return channels so I used the optical connection.  I then programmed my remote with an activity that changed the audio input on my receiver to the optical input and it got me in business.  If your receiver does audio return you might be able to get sound that way.Reflections... yeah, it reflects.  Not as bad as my old DLP but it still reflects windows and even lamps.  I was hoping it would be better but I'm not going to remove a star because it's an improvement over my old TV.  Do not expect a miracle, you will be disappointed.  My room is bright and the tv does fine.  At first the tv seemed dark but I was able to up the brightness and keep a sweet picture.  I have no complaints about how the TV handles ambient light.The stand- I like how it looks.  If I hadn't pre-purchased a new TV stand that comes with a mounting system I would have no problem leaving the TV on it's own stand.  You just gotta have a TV stand wide enough to hold the TV's stand because it runs the width of the TV.  Hopefully that wasn't confusing.3d- this was an unexpected bonus.  I bought the TV for size, picture quality, and bright room compatibility.  Netflix offers some 3d titles, and DirecTV offers a couple of 3d channels.  It's not IMAX, but I'm impressed.  I'll be looking to purchase a 3d blue ray player to take even more advantage of this feature.Overall I'm very happy with this TV.  It is easily the best TV I've owned.  It beats my DLP.. an 8 year old tv I wouldn't give up until now and I've been looking to up size for a few years now.  I've seen other LCD and Plasma TVs and wasn't impressed enough to pull the trigger and I'm glad I waited for a TV with a picture like this Samsung.  I could nit pick about the glare and buzzing but it's not enough to take a star away.  The glare reduction is better than my old TV and the buzzing is only noticeable when sound is muted.. and that's only if it's actually happening.Great purchase, I would do it again, and I would recommend the TV to others who are looking for good picture quality at this size.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "The BEST TV I have Ever Seen", "Author": "Arvind", "ReviewID": "R5R6U6E3NDZEW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I literally did some 3 to 4 months of research before buying this one.

Turns out, Samsung's 'scheduled appointment' is anything but that.  A private service center is dispatched, and supposed to call in 1 to 2 business days.  They called 4 days later.  They asked what the problem was (read the ticket!), and they said that the soonest they could schedule me was another week away.  Huh?  We have an appointment tomorrow.  Nope.  Samsung's 'scheduled appointment' is only a tentative appointment, and Samsung 'has no control over the service center scheduling process'.  Really?  It took me an hour going up the Samsung support food chain for them to tell me that.  So, the incompetence of their contracted service centers becomes my problem.

If you are a gamer like me, I would seriously think about buying a plasma TV before they are gone because the display of the different shades of black (which can really help killing zombies) and the 600 Hz (critical for a fast moving game like Rayman) are really critical to a great picture when gaming and even OLED can't match the Hz rate for $5000+.  Plus on a game like Mario Kart 8 that you can split the screen four ways, the size really matters.  The brightness is amazing.  The 3D is amazing.  It is a beautiful TV.  The resolution actually blows my Kuro away.

Also, I was going to buy a ZT60 instead, however I waited too long and they were discontinued and out of my price range :(  I couldn't justify the extra $1000 from all the reviews comparing it with this Samsung model.I received the TV and the initial setup was very easy. I had no issues getting everything sync'd and the wireless connection to my network was a breeze. The stand is sturdy enough, but it did wobble a bit as i cleaned finger prints from the glass, so I wouldn't recommend testing its stability TOO much. I would have wall mounted the set, but sadly that isn't allowed by my lease.This TV was an upgrade from a mid-range Panasonic 2009 S1 model. Of course I expected to see a dramatic improvement in PQ given the 4yrs difference and the fact that this is the top-tier Samsung model that was help up with the ZT/VT models from Panasonic. I was honestly blown away by the color depth and the brightness that everyone talks about. The Initial out-of-the-box colors looked fairly good as well. I watched Avatar and Avengers bluray discs and the crispness and image depth was a quantum leap over my old set!.In addition, the brightness that this set is known for is NOT overstated...it is easily bright enough to overcome its positioning in my smaller loft apartment. I have it placed on a corner tv stand facing away from the east wall of the living area which is essential a massive glass window/balcony door that lights the room during the day very effectively. With the dynamic setting on which is the most vivid out of the box I felt the image was incredibly bold and not the least bit washed out by ambient light.  At night I put the set to its movie mode and was quite please with the reduced brightness, but no noticeable detraction in PQ and no blooms at all.The last thing I want to touch on is the widely reported \"buzz\" which I did happen to hear, but it was barely audible. I was sitting ~11ft from the set and I noticed it when I had everything muted and it was as quiet as my place gets...however with the audio up at normal levels I never noticed it again (and i was intently listening for it after i heard it fearing the worst!). Maybe I got a lucky set without it being a distraction?

Both cable and BluRay look amazing.  It has more ways of tweaking the picture than I've ever seen, so it's hard to believe you couldn't create a picture you're happy with.I find the sound quality to be very good; I left my sound bar with my old TV.  There are a number of useful settings for audio, including a \"clear voice\" option that puts dialogue to the fore.  I have none of the buzzing that other people have noted.If your priority is high quality playback of TV and DVDs, as well as easy internet access, I think this is a great choice.  If you're attracted by all the bells and whistles, you may be disappointed.  A number of the heavily touted features only work if you're running your cable directly into the TV.  If you have to run through a cable box/DVR, the channel guide doesn't work, nor do the favorite channels or recommendations features.  (This was confirmed by Samsung tech support.)The \"voice recognition\" doesn't seem to recognize many words.  The \"motion control\" is like a poorly designed video game.  (But I'm not sure why you'd want to wave your arms in the air rather than picking up the remote and pushing a button.)  I quickly abandoned both of them.I also abandoned the Smart Hub remote.  Interesting idea, but a dud in execution--not very ergonomic and much more trouble than it's worth.  Fortunately, the standard remote that came with it is the best I've ever used.  Kudos to whoever decided, \"This new style of remote is so odd that we should throw a standard remote in the box, too.\"  This one effortlessly learned my cable box and DVD player.  (A very nice bonus is that when I turn on the DVD player, it automatically turns on the TV, too, and even sets it to the proper input.  When I turn off the DVD player, the TV goes back to HDMI 1.  Very smart!)The little bit of 3D I've watched was very good.  The \"2D into 3D\" feature is sort of a joke, but I didn't really think I could push a button and turn standard TV into 3D.  I'm not sure why the 3D glasses are designed so the frames can't be folded once they're assembled--it's pretty unwieldy to have a number of them lying around.The TV connected easily to my wireless signal.  The web browser, Netflix and Amazon Plus apps are very good.  The quality of the online picture is also good.  However, it won't recognize my Apple keyboard and tech support tells me, no, it only works with the Samsung keyboard (not included, of course.)Speaking of tech support, the Live Chat service is disappointing.  Mostly, they simply cut and paste out of the same manual you can access online.  If something isn't working the way it's supposed to or the manual is unclear, they're not going to be able to help.  They're always there and always polite, but I was given some pure misinformation.  (I had directions for a standard remote, but couldn't find the remote itself.  Live Chat told me the TV doesn't come with a standard remote, but I could buy one.  Later, I discovered the \"white glove installation\" team had put it behind a piece of furniture.)In the end, despite my disappointment in the operation or unavailability of some features, I'm not sorry at all that I bought this TV.

Plenty bright, but lots of annoyances like uneven lighting, grayish blacks, and so-so motion handling. I decided this year to dedicate a room in my home as a theater room. I wanted a secondary TV and at first was looking for a reasonably priced option. I went to my local Costco and bought a 65 in Vizio M series LED. Awful. Faint, dark vertical lines down the screen, terrible blacks, and infuriating remote. Took it back very quickly. Decided to look at plasmas after that because the crappy blacks really stood out in that dark room. Ended up ordering the 60 in version of this Samsung. It wasn't new, I bought it from Amazon Warehouse Deals. It had been repackaged but otherwise looked perfect. But it buzzed a bit more than I was happy with and it had a few dead pixels. Decided to return it and get a new one. Then I decided to just go ahead and get the 64 in since I was already blowing so much $$ anyway. This thing is great. Blacks are great. Motion is great.

LED TVs look much sleeker with no/ far-less bezel size, but I have no complaints the size/shape/weight of this TV.CONS:1. It is a bit slow to switch between apps and other input sources.

I've been eyeing this TV since it's release early in 2013, and saving my pennies. I've been a long time Plasma fan for the picture quality, having a 51\" Samsung PN51E7000 from 2012, and two Pioneer 42\" PDP-4280HD from several years ago. This one, by far, has the best picture quality, color detail and brightness. That said, let me give my impression of the Smart Hub update for 2013.For those who own a 2013 Samsung Smart TV, you are familiar with the 5 Page Smart Hub v2.0 versus the single App page from prior years. The concept was great, and added some nice features, but the usability for some pages, functionality of others struggles to please. First I'll mention the pages that work pretty well, then those that I don't believe do.I'll give merits to the Movies & TV Shows screen, which allows you to dig down to find what you want across 7 different VOD services (last I knew, maybe more now), including Vudu, Media Hub, Netflix, Hulu/Hulu Plus, Blockbuster, CinemaNow, and Crackle. However, I'm not a browser to find what I want to watch, and more a searcher, so the voice search via the NLU (Natural Language Understanding) works much better for my purposes.Likewise, the Photos, Videos & Music screen is a major improvement over previous years to access material on the network, or attached to the TV. I have a Network Hard Drive where i store all my music, photos and videos, plus Tablets, Smart Phones, and my computer, where I have media I want on the TV at times. I could always send to the TV easily, but this screen provides a simple method to access those devices from the TV.Last of the good is the App page. A cleaner look than the pre-2013 versus, and serves the purpose. I didn't like the \"recommended\" or as I consider them, the partner apps at the top which can't be changed to my liking but overall things work.Now for the last two pages, of which I'm disappointed, though luckily for those who purchased the Evolution Kit enabled TVs will be able to upgrade to the newest rendition of the Smart Hub this year.The Social page is pretty useless i my mind. I use Facebook and Skype, but not Twitter. What doesn't work is the thought to come to this page in order to use the Social features; it seems impractical. Downloading the Social TV App is much more useful, and it can be used while watching TV. What would be more useful is the ability to turn off this page so it doesn't show up.The OnTV page, or rather its functionality is my gripe and biggest disappointment. I upgraded my 2012 Plasma with the Evolution Kit early last year, so had experience with the new Smart Hub pages, but since I have that TV in another location, and am not the main user, thought the S-Recommendation not working as well was due to it not being used by me. However, now that I've had this TV and I'm the only one that uses it, I can see it just doesn't measure up. Connected to the internet, the Smart TV receives its TV Guide information from a company called Rovi (they only provide TV Guide type info). This is based on the zip code and service selected, so they match your programming service provided. Mine is Cox in San Diego. The TV really doesn't know what channel you're watching, but is supposed to be capturing details of \"what\" you are watching to better make recommendations.The built-in guide is pretty much useless. Since the TV doesn't know what you're watching, it defaults to the first channel (1) unless you've deleted certain ones from showing. It still starts from the top, so it leaves that guide pretty much useless. The Cox service guide can be accessed from the SmartTouch Remote, but more on that later. The real disappointment is the recommended programs, based on what you watch. The TV can be set to either Preference (which is based on your viewing habits) or Popularity, which is generally based on Top 100 Channels/Top 100 Shows across the specific service and time. As I said, I didn't use the 51\" Plasma as often, but this new one is all \"me\".I had the OnTV set to display when the TV was turned on, and after a moment, it would update. Even though I watch the same news channel every morning, it would sometimes show as a currently playing option, and other days it wouldn't. Many shows that I watch almost all the time when they are available, such as Big Bang Theory for example, would not show up as an upcoming or currently playing option. Thinking it might not be tracking, but basing its memory on what was selected through the TV, I even made it a point to find and select programs through the OnTV or search functions, but the results did not change. I think the concept is great, but in reality it struggles to succeed. I finally turned off the default OnTV screen when I start my TV.Last is the SmartTouch remote. Again great concept, but in regular use can be frustrating. I love the Bluetooth connectivity, size and many of the buttons. The touchpad can be imprecise at times when you want to move just one space, though obviously improves with practice. Forget it if you don't use the remote regularly. Cleaning up the remote and placing the additional functions under the \"more\" option onscreen is bothersome. I'd replace some buttons with others, such as ditching the \"Guide\" button (I explained why) for maybe \"Tools\", or at least configure it to bring up my Cox service guide. The Light is nice, but there are so few buttons, I know the layout without ever looking. I can access my Cox guide by sliding to the right twice, but navigating is still a pain with just the touchpad, where I might accidentally press it too hard to select an unintended channel. I tend to still use my Cox remote most of the time.Now the good to great news. As I said earlier, the Evolution Kit will be available later this year for this and other models, and I've seen some of the remote and Smart Hub updates for 2014. The remote looks much more useful and a nice elongated oval shape. It brings back several of the everyday buttons, but not all of them. It retains a small touchpad interface, but also incorporates arrow keys. The new Smart Hub has many new changes for the better, but I won't cover them. I just got back from a week at CES and got a good view of many of the new changes, and will have to check them out closely in a store when the 2014 models arrive.Despite my disappointment of the Smart Hub, the TV and all the models with Evolution Kit capabilities allows us to enjoy the newest updates in both hardware (processors, graphic processors, memory, etc) as well as major software/user interfaces (not just basic firmware updates).

Well I had the F7100 for four days. \"After numerous setting and picture calibrations\" the TV PQ was not what I was expecting at all. The colors of the LED pop so much that at night watching  Blue Ray movies I cough myself squinting just to adjust my eyes to the picture. The PQ was not there. When watching DIRECT TV the picture was cloudy not sharp even my wife made a comment \"why does the picture look so cloudy.\" Yes four days was long enough for me.

While looking over the new TVs, the OLED and 4K TVs were stunning as can be expected, but they will be immensely expensive when they hit the market.  While looking at the LED and Plasma TVs, one TV stood out for me.  That was the F8500 Series Plasma TVs.  At first I thought this was another prototype and could not believe I was looking at a Plasma Set.  Most Plasma TVs sit in darkened showrooms, because they are not meant to be in brightly lit environments, as Plasma TVs are not as bright as LED TVs.  But I realized that this was Samsung's latest Plasma TV with new technology.  Samsung uses its new \"Super Contrast Panel\".  Samsung Claims that this set is as bright as an LED, but with 8 Times the black levels of an LED set.  I can't refute that, as my impression was that the picture was very bright, and the blacks were inky black.  The TV was not in a darkened room or optimal viewing conditions, but a well lit room.  My subjective opinion was that this TV, the F8500 Series had the best picture of any 1080p (plasma or LED) Samsung TV that is being offered in 2013.  It came close to what the OLED TV looked like, but of course its much cheaper in price. I felt the F8500 was brighter than the top of the line Panasonic flagship ZT60 Plasma, also coming out in 2013 and which I got to view.  So I give this TV two thumbs up on picture quality. This was one my highlights of the Consumer Electronics Show. I wrote this review because I had a unique perspective to see ALL of the 2013 offerings from all of the manufacturers of TVs.

F8500:First off I'd like to offer a huge shout-out to the fine guys over at the BB Magnolia next to Roosevelt Field on Long Island. They had these two sets side by side on stands making a direct A/B comparison possible. They were able to sync up The Avengers on DVD so that both sets were playing this with only a 1\" -2\" second difference between what the two sets were displaying. Actually, that 1\" -2\" second difference was quite helpful in allowing an assessment of what was playing on one before looking at the other.First off, the F8500 had somewhat more pure whites than the VT60. That said, neither had anything like the eye searing whites and \"pop\" of the LED/LCD sets on the adjacent wall so if that is what you're after you're going to need to pass on both of these sets and opt, instead, for an LED/LCD. So the F8500 had more initial visual impact. My wife commented on this when she first saw both sets. After watching for a minute or two the strengths of the VT60 began to emerge. In fact, the longer you watched, the more apparent it was that the VT60 won convincingly in a number of categories. These included color saturation and \"depth\" (hard to describe this but the closest I can come is that the VT had more of a 3D effect even while displaying 2D material). It also simply blew away the F8500 in resolution of detail in dark scenes. Skin tones where more accurate on the VT and blacks definitely appeared 'blacker.' Neither set was using \"torch mode\" (i.e. Vivid/Dynamic), so any artificial exaggerations that might have been introduced by these settings were not a factor. Needless to say, neither were professionally calibrated so we were looking at out-of-the-box settings. I was rather surprised to find that red resolution was about a draw with both sets doing a superb job here. In view of the much touted new phosphor that Panny is using I had rather expected that this would be one area in which the VT would bury the F8500. This was not the case. Surprisingly it was in the blues that the VT excelled and completely dominated the F8500. Who whoudda figured?Anyway, I'm happy to report that my seemingly endless obsession deciding between these two sets has now come to a close and I'm going with the VT. A couple of other factors entered into my ultimate decision. These were that I adore the stand that the VT uses and detest the overly wide stand of the F8500; the VT provides two remotes for their set -- one of which is the cute little touch pad thing, the other of which is a more traditional remote that will allow far easier access to the unit's many feature more easily...the F8500 only offers the (admittedly very sleek and sexy) touch pad remote; the sound system of the VT is almost certain to beat the built-in speakers of the F8500...having owned the F8500 for about a week I can say that the built-in speakers of that unit were, at best, mediocre; finally I am a bit concerned over quality control issues with Samsung and I believe that over the long haul, the VT will prove to be more reliable -- I know that even the finest product can occassionally produce a lemon but I want to keep the odds on my side.So if you are a casual shopper (thankfully, not many of us here fall into that category) be careful and spend some quality time with both sets before you decide which way to go. First impressions can be deceiving! In view of the fact that I can now see that the VT offers what I believe to be a significant advantage in ultimate PQ I'm lowering my rating of the F8500 by one star -- still a great set but not quite in the same league as the VT60.[Edit: 4-11-13] -- After a great deal of soul searching and review scouring (as well as some degree of buyers remorse, I'll admit) I've decided to pass on this set and wait, instead, for the Panasonic VT60 series. It's not that the F8500 is a bad set, it's more that the Panny offers everything that this set does and then some at a similar price point. Two factors were of primary influence to me in my ultimate decision making. First, the weird verical viewing angle issue on this set is more disconcerting than I had originally realized. If standing and looking down at the set from even a 25 degree angle, the screen almost blacks out. However, probably the most important factor that influenced me to wait for the Panny was the audio quality. I use my TV without external speakers and this appears to be an area where the Panny shines. The F8500 speakers are, at best, just OK. So, for those of you reading this, please understand that I'm not knocking the F8500 at all -- I am just think that the Panny may offer the least little bit more for a similar price. If the Panny were $1000 more I'd very happily remain with the F8500. I am lowering my rating to 4 stars because I think the VT60 is slightly better and represents what a five star review should[Edit: 4-7-13] -- Major problem discovered. The set has a faint horozontal band across the screen about 2\" from the top. The band is only about a 1mm thick and is more apparent in scenes with orange and blue than darker colors. It's completely absent if the top of the screen is black but it's enough that it's got to be fixed or this bad boy is going back pronto! I'll update as things progress.I've had this fine set for three days now and I thought I'd share some provisional impressions. Just as you'd imagine, the picture quality (PQ) is just stunning with deeply saturated colors and inky blacks. I've never seen whites that are so white (a pet peeve of mine so this is a very nice finding). The unit itself is quite pretty aesthetically and is beautifully constructed, coming very well packed in it's rather large box. For those of you considering ordering it on the internet and having it shipped, have no fear. Setup is quite easy and connection is a snap with an HDMI cable. Be aware, though, that the HDMI inputs are along the left side of the TV (as you face the set) and are very close to the edge so it will be wise to buy and HDMI cable that has an angled, pivoting head. Otherwise the cable itself is likely to stick out from behind the unit once it's connected. The supplied remote is a thing of beauty. Small, brushed metal and easy to use. It is a bit of a pain to access all the set's fetures through the ouch pad, however, and I wish they had supplied a traditional remote in addition to this one for easier day-to-day use as the competing Panasonic VT60 does. The set even comes with something they call an \"IR blaster\" that plugs into the back of the set and runs to another component you may want to control with the TV's remote. You place the little box at the end of the IR blaster in front of that other component and program the TV to recognize that component and, voila, your supplied remote now controls that box too. Pretty neat. The set comes with four pairs of active 3D glasses which is very nice in view of the fact that the competing Panasonics come with none (Edit: this was in the VT50...the VT60, which is the F8500's current competition does supply two sets of active 3-D glasses with its units). Each pair of glasses would probably cost you about $30-50 each so there's a 'savings' these of at least $120. Again, nice touch Samsung. The glasses use a supplied button battery and have a tiny on-off button on the top of them. Sadly, there's no LED or other way to confirm that they're on or off so if you use them I'd suggest you take the battery out after each use and put them back in their plastic case or else you're likely to burn out the battery. I tried the glasses with the preinstalled app called \"Discovering 3D\" and the 3D feature works nicely. I'm not a huge fan of 3D so I doubt I'll be using it much in the future but it's nice to know it's there.There are features galore on this set. Sadly, most of them are what I'd call 'gee whiz' features that you'll probably play with for a while after getting the set, show off to friends and family and then rarely, if ever use again. Hand gestures and voice control are two that come to mind. Very cool but really of limited real world, day-to-day use IMO. I was surprised (and not too happy) to note that this set has a shocking degree of vertical axis dimming. I thought all plasmas had virtually unlimited viewing angles, both vertically and horozontally. Not so this set. Please understand that there is no dimming when transitioning from left to right, which is far more relevant in real world use as people are going to be seated across the horozontal plane while watching. However, when you walk up to the set (if it's on a TV stand or table) you'll notice a shocking amount of dimming as you get close to the set. From a seated position, with your head at virtually the same height as the TV, this is not a problem at all but for those of you who like to mount your TV to the wall high up you may want to be aware of this before you determine how high up on the wall you plan on mounting it. For me, this proved to be a deal breaker as it was apparent every time you got up from the couch and was extremely distracting. Whatever filter they're using that causes this is way too aggressively implemented. Perhaps the primary reason I ultimately decided to return the set (that and the mediocre sound from the built-in speakers).You'll want to play around with the picture settings to get it just the way you like and be sure to turn off the awful \"Eco\" circuit immediately if you keep the picture in \"standard mode\" (this is the best mode for overall viewing) as the default for this mode is Eco 'on.' This circuit will adjust the picture brightness to the room's ambient light. It's much like the circuit almost all smart phones have to conserve battery power but it's calibrated too agressively and cuts brightness too much in almost all environments in this TV. The sound quality from the built in speakers is decent at best and the set can be used without a HT set-up though you'll probably want one if you expect any real audio quality. If you listen to a lot of music or movies with a large dynamic range you'll probably want to invest in a good HT set-up but for general viewing the built-in speakers are marginally acceptable.Anyway, these are some fairly initial imresssions/observations.

And maybe in some cases that may work, but in this instance, I needed someone to come take a look. The highlight of the tech addressing my \"Laser-Beam buzzing\" problem was something I won't soon forget. When his diagnosis was \"I've never seen this before... but this is normal for plasmas.\" WHAT!?!? What if your Dr. told you that!?!?Amazon's customer service is some of the best there is the business. I've never received this level of service consistently carried out, with every interaction. So a big THANK YOU to them. As I was able to return the three sets I tried. The third one had a major reduction in buzzing, in that it wasn't \"Laser-Beam\" style buzzing, but more localized.

It's definitely a nice TV with a ton of features, but I am picky when it comes to a TV's ability to display various content.  I bought this TV to replace an aging Panasonic plasma.

All of the online reviews were great and in the store, the TV was stunning.  I wish they could have played a movie on it though....instead it was just airing a news broadcast.  It happened to be displayed next to the best selling LED Tv, which was great for comparison.  The details on this set were great....it looked sharper than the LED next to it, brightness was nice and the overall set looked very classy.  I was as excited to pick this one up, as I was when I bought my Samsung 58\" 860 series Plasma a couple of years ago. Back to Amazon to purchase.  Tv was delivered perfectly....love Amazon!  Set up was easy, got online in minutes and was flipping through channels in no time.  Unpacking took longer than setting it up.  Every show I tuned to looked amazing...crisp, bright, sharp....awesome.  Then I tuned in to a movie and my disappointment set in.  It looks like an LED program...you know, the kind that looks like video footage.  Wow....bummer.  I thought with 600hz refresh rate, the quality would surpass my other plasma.  Maybe with time I'll change my mind.After 4 weeks, my opinion has not changed.  Everything looks great on this TV.  The winter Olympics never looked so good!  Movies just aren't the same though. To me, they look fake just like on an LCD and LED screen, and there is visible motion blur and delay in action scenes.  I am not returning the TV though as the rest is fantastic, however, I will be watching movies on my Samsung 860 series which is far better for that.Pros:SharpBrightFull of functionsEasy set upCons:Movies look like video footage from a camcorder (insert sad face)Price - expensive features", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "NO HEADPHONE JACK!!!!", "Author": "Scott Miller", "ReviewID": "R10BPRNUMP4OHM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Arrived about a week ago.

The 3-D feature causes the screen to become dark because the lenses are like dark sunglasses.  This TV is expensive, presumably because it offers a lot of features, so one would expect them to work.  I found that various Samsung apps do not work.  When I wrote customer support their reply was not helpful.  The apps remain unusable for me.  When I called Amazon tech support for the product, they were generally unfamiliar with the features of the TV, but were able to answer one question.The TV has poor support for older external devices, such as VCRs and DVRs.  Only one non-HDMI device is accommodated.  I bought a component to HDMI connector, but the TV doesn't show any input through it.  The only sound out is via an optical port, so I had to buy an optical to RCA converter to connect my sound system to the TV.  The TV sound works well on some media and seems to be nonadjustable when the source is Netflix (taken from the TV app).  This is quite annoying, as the sound is too low.It is virtually impossible to use the browser or any log-in accounts without first purchasing the Samsung TV keyboard.  I did, but have found it to be inconsistent.  Sometimes it works fine and sometimes it doesn't.  For example, today I typed some text, but when I hit RETURN, nothing happened.  When I switched to the remote control and pressed the select button the text entered.  So, I have to use both the keyboard and remote to work with the \"smart\" features.The TV vertical viewing angle is severely limited when you have the TV below the level of your eyes.  I cannot stand up and watch the TV.  It simply fades away.Amazon delivery was okay.  The delivery people put the TV near my stand and removed it from the box (stand not attached).

The picture is the best I have ever seen in either LED or Plasma TV. My close friend Steve who purchased a similar panasonic product last year claims that the Samsung picture is better than on his product. There are some warts on the product but nothing that is worth packaging it up and sending it back within the 30 day purchase period (no malfunctions showed up, just product bugs.)I also bought a Blue Ray DVD drive made by Samsung in the hopes that the two products would work together seamlessly but the BD-H5900/Z player refuses to totally bond with the TV. I still might return that and buy another brand. I also bought a Sony STR-DH740 Receiver and that works flawlessly with the samsung TV once it is set-up. I attribute this to Sony's set of features, not Samsung.Some product flaws:1. Plasma noise knocked out all AM reciever reception within my house. The plasma noise also knocked out a set of 5 RF remote extenders that I have been using since 2001 to run a whole house TV system first with a satellite box, then with a cox cable box. I used the set of ferrite collars provided which allowed the remote extenders to just barely work, but they did nothing to improve the AM reception.2. To run this system, requires 5 remotes, because no one of the remotes comes close to doing the job. I have cox cable, and the Samsung \"universal\" remote falls way short of providing the same function as Cox's CISCO 3136 remote. The other Samsung remote provided has such a long learning curve, I doubt I'll ever learn to use it. It is definately not a wife friendly system. The \"universal\" remote and the Blue Ray DVD remote do not even work togethernor acknowledge each other's existence. The Sony reciever remote must be kept handy because the \"universal\" remote cannot possibly create all of the functions. The most you can say about it is that once the reciever is set-up properly, it functions well with the system. I think anyone who lays out $3k for a TV expects it to run with one maybe two remotes. this is the bigest disappointment of all about Samsung products, that of not enough homework on the remote design and function.3. Many of the software menus are convoluted and result in dead ends with no net improvement in system performance. Case in point the setup menu within the TV that accepts the DVD drive and might allow it to work seamlessly. Also the base setup routine which keeps asking for my zipcode, thinkiing that my current TV service provider is a satellite provider. It then lists a number of providers of which Cox is not in the list, then says setup is complete. Needless to say, setup is not complete, when you use \"inputs\" function to examine which HDMI jack the cox box is attached to, it shows the wrong jack. Even so, when you turn on the system 99% of the time the cable box and the reciever turn on and I get sound through the speakers hooked to the receiver.The DVD drive remains dead to the world unless I grab its' remote and turn it on.4. The voice control function apparently does not work. Once set up it interferes with watching about every 15 minutes, requiring some sort of user response. I have disabled this and the camera function as the annoyance factor is currently too high with both of these functions.5. The mounting hardware and base provided, are completely inadequate for a safe and solid installation. Fortunately I had previously purchased a BDI TV bench with mounting pedestal which made a good installation possible, without having to mount the TV on the wall.6. I have an existing over the air TV system in my house which I hooked up to the coax connector on the TV. The TV repeatedly said \"not enough signal\" on this connector but then offered to auto-scan for channels. Once I figured out this obvious flaw in the menu structure, it listed all of the channels scanned including some NTSC (analog ) channels for which it also displayed the picture. However when the guide function was pressed, those analog channels did not show up in the guide listing (This might be an ROVI hack).To sum up, this is a relatively new product that came out of the \"new product oven\" too soon. The software menus were designed by beings who evolved on another planet in a culture foreigh to the American culture. The fact that Samsung included a future hardware upgrade that can bolt on the back of the TV shows that they knew there would be trouble in this area. I can only hope that they read all the reviews like this one and come up with some software and hardware fixes that address the problem. It had better be reasonably priced, or many of these still working TVs will be traded in for someone elses product next year.After reading this review, i believe many will say \" why didn't you send the damn thing back?\". Truth is I felt that all the other stuff out there LED OLED or plasma would create the same number of small complaints that this set generated, so I have decided to keep plugging away, working through poorly designed menus in hopes of improving performance, to resolve at least some of the above listed complaints.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Samsung snubs Mac users", "Author": "J.
