{"Reviews": [{"Title": "More than satisfactory for the price!", "Author": "Jordan.Mo", "ReviewID": "R1FMK9HL4ALPCK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought this TCL hdtv set to replace my older 2009 lcd 19\" which I've bought during a black Friday for $300(yea that was considered a bargain for such a size tv back then). I placed my order this past black Friday and it came by UPS on the following Monday, faster than I expected. So if the early delivery wasn't enough here are some of my pros and cons:Pros:-Price - I did a lot of online research looking through bargains for a tv in the range of 22-32\" in the price  range of $100-200. The only site which could compete with this deal would be what Best buy had with a 40\" lcd tv for $200 and their other 22\" for $80. Of course they were sold out across the US ( believe me I checked the availability online). So for the price I bought this for $169; which is $231 in savings, you really can't find such a deal in many if any other place for a new 1080p led tv.-Quality- I never bought any product from TCL but I was surprised at how well the picture and menu guides look. The remote control was responsive; I know some other major retailers feature a 'time lag' with theirs. The picture quality reminds me of my friends' 37\" plasma 1080p tv, just as crisp. The sound was better than my old tv; it could be turned really loud so additional speakers weren't necessary.Cons:-Base- My only con would be that you had to assemble the base of the tv set, unlike my 19\" toshiba which came in the package already assembled. If you have an electric drill then you probably won't be annoyed by that.All in all, for the price you really can't get much more than this. If you were looking for a decent led 1080p tv that won't break the bank then you can't go wrong with this tv.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good bang for my buck!! 12 volt!!!!!", "Author": "Karen K.

Though i just recieved it earlier today (so the verdict isn't 100% complete) i am so far quite impressed.PROS:: Price. Even at $200 i think this is a very competitive TV.: 3 HDMI ports! On a 24\" !!:Headphone Jack: this is crucial. Especially since lord knows small led tvs sound horrible. The jack is also controlled by the remote. This is actually quite rare on tvs this size (i don't know why) but it is really handy. I hooked up a 2.1 Antec Rockus speaker setup i just bought and it worked great! And i could use the remote to adjust the volume. Thank you TCL!:12 volt! This tv is actually 12 volt (runs on a transformer when plugged into the wall) but can actually plug into a cigarette lighter if you just get a proper sized plug. PERFECT for an RV!!!:Picture quality: pretty darn good considering the relatively low contrast ratio. After some tinkering in the settings i got everything looking pretty natural. I also noticed minimal LED glow/bleed through around the edges  when the picture is dark. I was pleasantly surprised how consistent the blacks were.:Setup was easy and the digital over the air tuner seems decent.:A really nice guide/info setup for OTA channels. Even has a picture in picture setup goin on when in guide. A pleasant surprise.:Good looking frame. Nice glass stand. Doesn't look overly cheap.CONS ::Thick. For most i'm sure this is no issue, but at over 2.5 inches it is thicker than i would have liked for my purposes.:Not the greatest viewing angle. It does fade out a bit when off center.:the speakers are bad... But i was expecting that since ALL small flat panels sound bad. I wish people would realize this.In the end i think i did really well at $159 and i would not feel bad about having spent $200.

The TV was easy to unpack and set up. You do need a phillips head screwdriver to install the base, not a big problem though. It has plenty of easy to reach connections. I wanted a TV for my bedroom to watch basic cable and as a computer monitor. I just needed the coaxial cable and VGA connections, which was very easy to find and connect.

Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2MZ4MBWNI8WLF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Maybe it's just my bad luck but I got a buggy TV. The first time I turned it on, the TV menu would pop up by itself after about 5 minutes. Then it pop up and off very quickly nonstop. It was late after work so I just gave up trying to figure out what's going on so I unplugged it. Next day I turned it on and the menu didn't pop up and off until about 15 minutes later. I thought it might be a bad remote so I took out the batteries. No luck.I went on the manufacture site and the trouble shooting section said for any issue, try rebooting the TV by unplugging it for 5 minutes. I tried that and the menu didn't pop up until 30 minutes later. I repeated the reboot a number of times during the day and menu would pop up between 30 minutes - 1 hour after I turn it on. At first it will pop up once every few minutes. Then the time interval got shorter and shorter until it pop up and off every second.Next day, I thought my luck had changed! I was watching for almost 2 hours and thought the issue had resolved itself. Then it happened again. This time, the menu popped up and didn't go away by itself. This one is going back to Amazon and a new one is on the way. Hopefully the replacement won't have any issue.As for picture quality (when the menu isn't blocking everything), it can't compare to my 2 year old Sony 40\" LCD and definitely nowhere close to my brother's LED, but it's good enough for the kitchen. At about 3ft away, my Sony is crisp and clear. On the same 1080i HD channel at the same distance, this TCL picture is noisy, sometime pixelated as if it was a low def channel. The TV has noise reduction but it doesn't help even on the high setting. Step back a few more feet and the picture for 1080i channels look pretty good, but still can't compare to my Sony.I tried a couple bluray via a high quality HDMI cable and the TV report it's a 480 SD connection. Picture quality for animated movies seems a lot better than live motion pictures.The picture presets are horrible. They are way too saturated and the red bleeds for all of them. I had to use the personal preset but there is only one so I can't have more than one custom preset. I've dialed down everything to make it watchable. I still haven't gotten the perfect setting but the picture is not bad from a distance.Today, 12/6/11, the menu is popping up about once every 5 minutes and stays on for about 1 minutes before disappearing. The replacement comes tomorrow and I'll ship this one back. Just need the Amazon box to ship it back in.If it wasn't for the menu bug, I would give it 4 stars. It would be perfect for the kitchen or wherever you want to stick a 24\" TV. The picture quality is pretty good if you can figure out the perfect settings. There are many different inputs and outputs. There is a USB input so you can access media off a thumb drive. The Energy Star rating is only $9 a year! If the replacement has no issue, it's definitely a keeper.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not perfect... But for the price this is very solid", "Author": "gmanvbva", "ReviewID": "RSGG9RBG68RZN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to provide some quick feedback, since there are very few reviews for this TV.I recently purchased this based on a lightning deal. Last week I purchased a RCA LED24A45RQ on sale for BF (199).I still have both but the RCA is being returned tomorrow.I just received the TCL today. In my quick comparison this evening to the RCA... the picture is very comparable but the TCL did look to have a more smooth picture.The big differences are as follows.1. The TCL has MUCH better sound. Don't get your hopes up though. This speaks more about the absolutely horrible sound on the RCA. Small TV's like this often get critical reviews for their sound quality so I figured it couldn't be that bad. But it is. The TCL sound is more on par with what you would expect (adequate sound... and that's it).2. The TCL has RCA audio out jacks (red/white), which would allow you to connect external speakers. The RCA only had digital out for audio.3. The TCL has a USB port. This is obviously intended for viewing photos from a thumb drive but it works great for connecting some external USB powered speakers I have. The added bonus being that the USB port is powered down when you turn off the TV (shutting off the USB powered speakers).All other inputs and features are almost identical.I'll update this review again next week when I have had more time to use this TV.For now this TV is definitely worth the price. I'm thinking about purchasing a second.Update: Remote notes. I can't control this with my DirecTV remote but from what I have read my Harmony should work (once I program it) or this cheap remote has been reported to work for both.Sony RMVZ320Update2:I was able to program my DirecTV remote.

I just use a digital coax antenna and the TV even has a (simple) guide with PiP!!What's Not Great ):  Lots of black is a little tough to see (cancel that videos-of-you-in-the-dark party you had planned) and I wish the remote had a sleep button.What You Need To Know ?-:  The TV's power box is not built-in to the TV, so plan on setting that big, heavy, warmish thing somewhere.  The viewing angle isn't very wide - you'll appreciate it most if it's in a room where you typically look straight at it.Compared To The Other Reviews /-:  Mine has worked perfectly for 6 months and the base was very easy to attach with a screwdriver.

I'm not looking for a Bose surround-sound experience, and this thing works fine for just a TV set-up in the bedroom. The video quality is clear, but needs some adjustment for movie viewing (the blacks are too low). On the other hand, for gaming the settings are perfect.Cons:-I personally hate the glass base stand. I put in one of the screws and actually made a crack. Not enough to hurt the stability of the structure, but it still bothers me that it happened so easily (wasn't even forcing it).-Viewing angle is sub-par. While for the most part I can see the TV just fine, the stand allows for no adjustment and even faces up a little bit, so if the TV is higher than your head you need to make some adjustments. I personally put a \"eat this not that\" book under the back of the stand base to lower the angle of the screen, otherwise it would've been unwatchable.So anyways, at this point I have my personal display settings with low contrast and brighter blacks for movies and the \"ECO\" setting for videogames.

It arrived on time, to the day, and in the condition described.After playing around with it a while, I found several things I liked, and other things that were kinda disappointing.The good stuff:  Beautiful styling.  Runs from +12 volts.  Has VGA input.  Thin LED design.  Bright, sharp image.  It will provide images for DOS, WIN95, and WIN7 systems.  I tried it out in a variety of legacy VGA formats and it locked onto all of them and provided an image.  I will report later if I am successful in getting it to replace the old monochrome monitor.Disappointing:  The menu leaves off a few things I would have really liked... like a brightness control.  I also would have liked size and position controls for VGA monitor use, as my DOS and WIN95 screens have the top lines cropped off.  I also have 22\" VISIO LED TV/monitors that do not crop off the top of the image.  The controls seem to me like the software team was really pushed to meet the Christmas season and shipped it before it was done.  For instance, once I connect to the computer, I have to cycle power to the TV to regain the menus.  The power LED flashes when it detects remote keypresses, but it just ignores them.  I find the lack of fitting the image to the screen exactly ( like the VISIO does ) to be quite an annoyance if I need to use an icon on the top of the screen.  ( the zoom control will still work in PC mode which lets me put the 800 x 600 pixel image squarely in the middle of the screen, which is small on a 1920 x 1080 screen ).  In native HD format (1920 x 1080), it worked properly with my WIN7 system.My VISIO also will go into sleep mode upon loss of VGA signal in PC mode, automatically waking up into PC mode when signal is re-established.  So far, I have yet to get the TCL to do this.Mounting:  The people who returned this obviously had tried to wall-mount it - and failed.  This device does not look like it will take well to wall mounting unless you make some special hardware for it.  It does not use the standard screw hole pattern, nor are the connector panels laid out for a clean flush fit against a wall.  ( the connectors are oriented outward from the thickest part of the display ).  If you have a machine shop handy, go for it.  But don't expect to go to your local walmart for mounting hardware for this.The screen will not pivot on the base, neither horizontally nor vertically.  Horizontally, no big thing, as the TV is so light you simply move it, base and all, to suit, but vertically, it could be bothersome if you want the screen to tilt up or down.  Propping the base leads to center-of-gravity issues.  I suppose if you were determined to tilt it downward, you could bend the mounting bracket ( I'll describe it below ) a bit.  I think you are out of luck if you want to tilt it upward.The manual is not too clear on this, but if you need to install the base mounting bracket back in the TV, you will need to remove the center two screws ( there are four in all, in a row, in recessed holes, along the lower back of the TV enclosing the electronics package ) completely with a #2 phillips screwdriver.  Then loosen the other two, but do not remove them ( three turns or so ).  This will get the cover loose enough for you to slip the mounting bracket in so the holes in the mounting bracket will align with the screw holes for the removed screws.  Now replace the two screws you removed - now capturing the bracket, and snug them all up.  Of course, you should have the lucite tube installed on the bracket ( held in place by the three \"wood screws\" ) before you try to install the bracket into the TV, as once installed, you no longer have access to where the lucite tube screws attach!  It was a bit of a head-scratcher for me, but eventually I got it.All in all, considering the price I paid, I will keep it, as I do need the hi-res display, LED, VGA, and 12 volt power features of this unit.  The hardware guys did well, I give them 5 star.  The software guys got a good start but they need to finish the job.. 3 star.  The mechanical guys get a 5 star for aesthetics, and a 3 star for placement of connectors that make wall mounting awkward as well as nonstandard wall mounting.If I had paid $400, I'd be miffed.

If you read the manual, it says VESA 200, not VESA 200x100 or VESA 200x200. This is correct. It only uses two mounting screws 200 mm apart. Attach the two included brackets to the back of the TV above the inputs. After that it will attach to any 200mm mounting bracket.Also, it appears people are having trouble removing the base mounting knob. Simple remove the two screws above the mounting knob, and pull it down.I don't generally write reviews, but I wanted to address a couple of the issues people seem to be having. Other than that, the TV works fine. The colors do seem to be a little off. I changed it to the movie preset, and it helped with some of the washed out color look.I rated it four stars because the instructions are lacking (obviously by the complaints). But wanted to assure people that it is easily wall mountable, and the issues are more related to instruction rather than defect in the product itself.

This TV has replaced in our kitchen a 19\" Philips which I got 3 years ago for $199, which in the day was a great deal, which in turn replaced a 15\" Samsung. Those 2, older 26\" Olevia and our 42\" and 55\" LG form the basis of comparison. This is probably the biggest TV we could feet between the counter and the cabinets since we have standard 18\" distance. It goes under the cabinet as close to flush as practical. I will list what I see as pros and cons and then add more info that may be relevant to your buying decision:Pros: Easy set-up, decent colors, many inputs, USB port, headphones out, and pretty decent look.Cons: The biggest issue I found so far is the absence of VESA mounting holes - apparently you would need to purchase a conversion plate, or a wall mount that has adjustable mount points (prepare for more $$ if you will be mounting on the wall). I will also agree that unlike many others it does require a screw driver to attach the stand and the you have to be careful doing that or as someone pointed out you will crack stand \"protrusions\" that seems too thin for the size of the screws. It is a bit on the thick side as people noted, even with absence of built in power supply (there is an external one that comes with the TV)Other info: I do not consider viewing angle to be worse than many other flat screen TV's, not much different from my 55\" LG, and for sure not worse than Philips it replaced. I also do not consider the sound to be a negative. Yes, the quality you get out small speakers can not compare even with a lower end sound bar, but by comparison they are probably better than the ones in the previous TV or in older 26\" Olevia. The speakers are down firing, so it is possible that a close proximity of the counter makes the sound reflect better.My conclusion: this TV will give you a good bang for your $ if you do not expect sound like from the speaker system, do not mind driving a few screws and do not plan to attach it to the wall mount that requires VESA spaced screw holes.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good, not great.

Unfortunately, the TV I replaced used a VESA 100 mount and this required a VESA 200. I ordered a set of extenders for $10 and installed the TV yesterday. I'll follow the lead of other reviewers and list some pros and cons.Pros $149, multiple inputs, better than expected sound thanks to an equalizer feature, multiple preset picture settings, multiple size ratio settings, 1080p quality.Cons: Wall mounting; it's a good thing I decided to use my VESA 100 and get extender brackets. A typical VESA 200 will not work. To make it fit, I had to install the lower extenders horizontally, which is normal, and the upper extenders downward at a 45 and 135 degree angle to fit the mounting holes. The second issue with wall mounting is you want to remove the neck at the bottom of the tv that mounts to the base. The manual gives no instructions about how to remove it but you figure out that you need to remove the cover to access the neck. The problem I had was that I never noticed the one black screw that was holding cover around the inputs. I easily found the 2 side screws but that one screw really screwed me up. Pun intended.I almost cracked the cover trying to force it off. Luckily, I spotted the screw before I did.The other knock I have is getting my Dish Network remote to work the TV. There is no code to program the remote to this TV. I'd like to avoid having to use 2 remotes given this is my kitchen TV.I'll provide an update as I get acclimated to this unit.UPDATE 12-20-2011: Thanks to Amazon shopper KT, code 503 will program a Dish Network remote to operate this TV.

I was nervous as the price was low, but I am more than pleased with the outcome. I am using this TV in my toddler son's room.  The TV produced great picture quality for this purpose as he mostly watches the Disney HD channel.  I did play with the contrast and color settings a little, but even the preset options produced good video. The input options on this television are great for a TV of this price.  Most TV's with this price only have one HDMI port, but this one has three.  This really is a great TV for the price I paid.A few things to note:When attaching the base for the first time, the screws are very hard to get in.  It is almost as if the holes for the screws are not pre-threaded and the screws have to thread the holes when first screwed in.Since this TV is in a toddler's room, I wanted to mount the TV out of his reach.  This is where I became a little frustrated.  It took me a while to figure out how to remove the base.  You have to remove the two screws just above the base and then pull down on the base.  You then have to re-tighten the screws.  There is a cover supplied in the box to put over the hole.  The next problem was finding the right mount for the TV.  The owners guide says to purchase a VESA 200 mount.  I purchased the VideoSecu Articulating Arm TV Wall Mount from Amazon.  The TV comes with mounting brackets that attach to holes near the top of the TV.  There are not any holes to mount the bottom of the TV to a mounting bracket.  I used the supplied screws in the mounting kit to secure the mount to the TV.  I did buy some larger washers from the hardware store to insure the TV was secured safely.  Since the TV does not have holes to secure the bottom of the TV, I used some strong double sided tape to secure the TV to the bottom part of the mount.  The TV is designed to be mounted using only the two screws at the top of the TV, but I felt better adding the tape.  The TV DOES feel very stable and secure even with it tilted downward for optimum viewing. I have uploaded pictures of the mounted TV for everyone to see.Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would not hesitate to purchase a second one.

I definitely had concerns about mounting the base plate, as it appears many people had some serious issues with that.  Well, my base and screws was attached in no time, like 3 minutes tops.  Oh, and I didn't know there was a black plastic ring that needed to be attached prior to screwing the screws in, so I'm glad I looked very closely at the installation diagram.  And THANKS to the folks that mentioned to spray some WD40 on the screws!  I think that may have made them screw in so very easy.I just received the unit today, and I have it on as I'm typing this.  I've set it up and I will tweek it later on, and watch it for the next few weeks and come back and update my review with any changes or additions.  I rate it now at 4 stars since I just received it and I'll need several days to determine the rating I would ultimately give it.But, as of right now I'm very impressed as I only paid $137.00 for this NEW and you just can't' beat that price for such a nice picture and the sound too (which isn't as tinny as most say after you set up the equalizer), and ABOVE all it can be ran on 12 volts!!!!!  That in itself is a major PLUS in my book.  I have it hooked up in my RV (which I travel and live in), and this was mandatory.  I used a 12volt extension plug that I already had on hand that I used to use on a 13 inch tube TV I used to use.  You can buy the 12 volt DC cigarette lighter cable from other retailers like Jensen who makes 12 volt TVs.  Matter of fact Jensen's 24 inch models are over $400, and other cheaper 12 volt models I looked at are not certified as \"energy savers\".  So, this was the BEST bang for my buck and I'm very very satisfied as of right now.If you're looking for a 12 volt DC power cord with cigarette lighter adapter from Jensen,(Jensen heavy duty dot com) the part number is DCCIG09, which they use for all their 12 volt TVs 19 inch - 32 inch models.  I think the amperage on the inline fuse is 8amp, and total cost for the cord is $9.99 with free shipping before coupon. You get a 20% off coupon if you sign up on the site.Also, here's a link to the 24 inch model's energy star information, which contains wattage and amperage info, and you can look for all other models too:[...]I have my unit set to ECO mode, and I also selected the mode that has the least amount of brightness. I hooked it up to a voltage analyzer, and the reading only dropped less than 1 amp while in use. I'm extremely pleased with this, as I do LOTS of boondocking.I will definitely come back here and update my review within 2 weeks.UPDATE (August 5, 2012):  I've had time to tweek the picture and sound, and I am VERY VERY pleased.  I can't believe I only paid $137.28 for this TV.  What a deal.  I use it throughout the day and in the evenings and I don't even worry about my RV battery draining, as I'm running this TV off of straight 12volt battery power.I wonder if any of the TCL 32 inch models run off 12 volt, because if I can buy one of those units (on sale), I'll put it in my living area, and put this 24 inch in my bedroom.  I will definitely purchase this product again. It looks good and performs perfect for my lifestyle, and so much better than I could have imagine.

The tv came a couple weeks later just before Christmas. I use this tv in my bedroom so its the perfect size I was looking for. Setup was easy, there were a couple screws to hold down the stand and the tv together. Some people might not like the glass stand because its glass and not the usual plastic used on LCDs, but after awhile I got used to it so I don't mind. The outside frame also has a glass edge to it which is nice but creates a small glare if you notice. The screen itself does not create a huge glare effect from any angle or distance, that's what I like about it. There are plenty of HDMI ports on the back and side which is very convenient for gaming and blu-ray players. The ac adapter cable is somewhat short so I rest the adapter on my drawer instead of leaving it hanging which might cause tension on the ac jack which could lead to a damaged jack. One thing I need to find is a tv dust cover since the tv is small enough to be covered when not watching.After that, channel setup and display setup was easy and straightforward. The tv recognized alot of channels that I use from my antenna. One thing I don't like is how remote controls are getting rid of the caption button so I'd have to go into menu, setup, closed caption, cc setting, then ON, so adding a caption button would make things much easier. Other than that the remote is very easy to use. I like the guide button and the info button the most because they give me info on the channel and tv show. The guide tells me what will be on tv later on and gives me descriptions too, very nice! The audio is nice, its clear and loud enough for my room. Picture quality is nice, although sometimes people look a bit sunburned. If viewing the tv from a low position the tv looks dark but if viewing from a higher position the tv seems normal or brighter. So I might mount the tv at a downward angle to fix this.

Very light weight & took me less than 10 minutes to attach the stand/base to the TV - I couldn't get the screws to tighten fully so it wobbles a little but since I haven't moved it after initial set-up, things are fine. I would probably be somewhat annoyed or worried about breaking it if I wanted to move it around to set up other electronics. It does not shut off completely, just remains in a standby mode & wakes up about 20 seconds after pressing power on remote. Picture quality is good although it doesn't seem to want to let me adjust screen brightness. There are several pre-loaded settings I can choose from though (the usual dynamic, vibrant, normal, etc). I am very satisfied with the sound - I usually keep the volume at 8-15 & still worry about the neighbours hearing it (at 8 for action movies & upto 15 for soft-spoken movies; tv resides in a living room/dining area about the size of 1.5 regular-sized rooms which are not sound-proofed). Comes with 3 HDMI ports plus the usual AV ports. It easily recognized my DVD player & allows me to use 1-click zoom from the remote een after I adjust zoom from my dvd player - that is if my player doesn't adjust display to my max preference I can use the TV's zoom to get the widescreen effect.

Give you the wrong address to send the TV if you choose to spend $10.30 to send it UPS yourself.2.  Once they track down your TV (only after you call 877.470.7766, wait an eternity for a live body to tell you that the TV went to the wrong address), they will ask you for your proof of purchase, which was provided when you opened the ticket.3.  You wait again.  I suggest that you take the time while you are waiting to write a product review.  I was actually connected to an agent after waiting 35 minutes and being disconnected 14 times!4.

The power supply that I had indicated was the problem when I first called TCL, was replaced.  Replaced with a USED power supply manufactured for a Hannspree TV!Unfortunately the power cord that goes into the power supply was probably the one I sent in - it will literally fall out of the power supply.  It should fit snugly.  Moreover, the end that plugs into the TV does not fit properly either.I can only hope that the voltage and wattage are appropriate for the set.  Since the TV comes on, that must indicate that it is fixed properly?  Guess again.  Oh wait - you are COMPLETELY out of guesses.  Epic FAIL.Amazon has way too much class to allow this to happen.  The problem is not Amazon's direct fault - however, they DO choose to allow substandard manufacturers to sell junk THROUGH Amazon.  It was not purchased through a 'sponsored merchant', but Amazon direct.TCL's choice of a repair facility in the US is an abomination.  I feel like I sent my TV to an electronics graveyard where a middle school drop-out was tasked with 'fixing' my TV with non-OEM parts out of a junk pile.I expect that Amazon will contact me to rectify this, as I am done with wasting my valuable time with TCL and A&D; Electronics.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Versatile with multiple inputs, excellent quality and picture", "Author": "Andrea Polk", "ReviewID": "R1TEPYFZ74REZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this 24\" HDTV for a gift for my mother for her birthday.  Limited space in her bedroom (where the TV was to be placed) made me choose something smaller, and for less than $140 shipped I received a solid LED HDTV with a 2 year warranty.  A great buy and a purchase I would make again in a heartbeat.The picture is bright and clear, with several settings in the 'Set-up' menu that allow you to easily customize your viewing with pre-set views like Cinema or Eco, or with manual adjustments to contrast, color, etc.  The channel labeling is a cool feature that allows you to rename channels or inputs so you know exactly what it is, the way you want to remember it.Scanning for channels is also done in set-up and it took approximately 3 minutes with 'antenna' vs 'cable' as an input (rabbit ears attached to the TV) to find 10 local analog channels and 8 local digital ones.  All the major networks in HD came in clear through the digital tuner in this TV.  We will be hooking up cable to this TV, but I wanted to set it up with an over air connection first to check the tuner out, and it works well.The remote doesn't have back lighting so that you can easily see it in the dark, but that's not a big deal and certainly not expected at this low price point.  It gets the job done!This set would be perfect with a Paper Thin Leaf Indoor HDTV Antenna - Made in the USA! or Leaf Plus Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna in your RV, or in an urban area with lots of over the air channels, and a Roku HD Streaming Player with Netflix and Hulu Plus subscriptions.  That combo could make cable unnecessary!I love that it has inputs galore! VGA (15-Pin D-Sub)- for PC monitor function, composite, component video, RF input, USB and 3 HDMI ports.

This is a cool function and I played with it, leaving the sound on 'auto', but changing the picture back to manual as it seemed to be too dim for my liking when I was testing it.My Mom loves the TV and that her Roku pops up as a channel versus having to switch to a specific channel like '3' to view it.  Amazon Instant Video movies come through crystal clear via the Roku on this set, generally streamed in 720p or 1080i.  She also loves the Sleep Timer function for Late Night viewing.This is a small HDTV with room for expansion via it's many input ports.  Great picture, nice sound with ports to add speakers for an even bigger sound if you choose.The TCL 24\" is also one of the thinnest LED HDTV's I've seen.  Unobtrusive stand that's easy to attach to the TV, and an updated look that would easily fit into any decor.  The TCL 24\" HDTV is really impressive when compared to the VIZIO E220VA 22 Inch Class Edge Lit Razor LED LCD HDTV I own in its design, inputs and performance.This HDTV is a super choice for anyone who wants a quality TV backed by a 2 year warranty for versatile use, without a big price.

I went with the four star for several reasons, but let me tell you that this is a great television.  I purchased this on a gold box deal for under $200 to replace a 20 inch ten year old tube television that the picture had lines on the top ten percent of the screen, and was probably going to get worse.  I believe that I paid in the $250 or more range for that television, which could probably now be used to anchor a small boat.  The picture on this television is good, as this is a bedroom television used to watch the news in the mornings and some television late at night, it does very good.  I'd definately consider buying another one of these televisions if the price was in the ballpark of what I paid for this one.  I would have expected one HDMI input for a television in this price range, but this one has three, and has many other features that are mainly found only on higher end televisions.  I had bought my daughter a 22 inch TCL for Christmas the year before, and it has done well, so I was comfortable with the brand.Granted this is not an expensive television, my issues were minor, but are as follow:-  The remote could be a little easier to find the channel and volume buttons on.  I have several remote devices in my house, and this is the only one that has this issue.  Generally these buttons are more prominent and can be found easier without searching for them on the remote.  I wonder why they didn't recognize this when manufacturing the remotes.-  The base of the television is not bad, although lighter than I would have expected, but the user assembly of the base makes it seem a poor design.  I have put many things together in my life, and this one did not seem to be the best manufacturing concept.-  Instructions - not sure what to say about these, but I did not find the instruction book to be well written.  For example, the television has a wall mounting concept that requires only two screws, at least that is what I have figured out.  There were two spacers that seem to go with this idea, but the instructions do not seem to fully explain these and how to mount the television.  I would be concerned if using an articulated mount, but a flat wall mount would not be an issue, and the weight of the television should allow for even the most basic of mounts.  I don't plan on mounting the television to the wall currently, but that option is possible in the future.  This is not something that I want to find laying on the floor after the mounts did not do their job.  I would prefer to see a four screw mounting concept instead of the two.To sum it up, the main reason I give this television a four star instead of a five star review is the mounting system and poor instructions, otherwise this television has a great picture and features that cheap televisions don't have.  I'd consider buying another one of these televisions in the future if I had the need, and would recommend the television to anyone interested in a television in this price range.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "completely satisfied", "Author": "qw", "ReviewID": "RA8VR30VP977Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've tried a couple of 24inch LED HDTV 1080p from various brand such as Vizio, Apex and TCL etc, this item is the best in both video and sound quality.The 3 watt build-in speaker is more than enough for average sized bedroom.Factory setting of picture/video needs to be adjusted like this:turn up sharp from 4 to 6,turn color from expert settings from 50 to 42.It will be saved to Personal picture mode.

We used the Philips screwdriver, but it was tight getting screws in, and we did not want to crack it. So we took our time.I bought this to replace a 27\" flat screen that I got 8 yrs ago.

I tried the one for DirecTV and it did not work, and I could not find a place to type in TCL.Someone posted the code for Dish TV, and I tried that.This is what I did:1) Press Menu on your DirecTV remote.2) Select Parental, Fav's & Setup3) Select System Setup4) Select Remote Control5) Program Remote6) Select  TV7) Select RCA8) Move mode switch to TV9) Press Mute & Select until light over TV mode flashes twice.10) I used code 11547 then pressed volume up.

Try volume again.If volume goes up, Move switch out of TV mode and back to DirecTV mode and select Done. Also the DirecTV remote has to be aim properly to move the volume.

Got it for my bedroom to replace an older small set.Assembly of the base plate was quick and easy, be careful putting the screws in so you don't strip the plastic base.  Power cord has an attached power supply, simliar to a laptop.  Remote does not come with AAA batteries, but I had some laying around.  Initial powerup and setup requires the normal stuff; language, source, etc, plugged it into the coaxial in the wall (no cable box in between) and selected channel scan.  It surprisingly detected \"digital\" channels on my cable system and put them into the channel ineup.  My previous set was an older tubed set and never detected these channels.  Now, I have a few new digital channels, some HD, and they are sprinkled throught the lineup.  The set is wide-screen, so any channels that are not that format will come in as a smaller square box with a surrounding black border.  It automatically detects the digital wide-screen channels and adjust the picture.  The remote has a button so you can cycle through various types of views to adjust the picture (normal, zoom, wide, etc).  You can also select various inputs, TV, HDMI, PC, etc.  The back has various audio and video inputs to connect peripherals.The picture takes significant tweaking to find a good view - this is my first LED tv so I'm finding it's much different and difficult than the older and simpler sets.  The blacks are very dark, and it seemes to bleed over to other colors.  I had to mess with the contrast to get colors and details separated.  There are a few automatic settings like Sports, Natural, Sharp, Cinema and they adjust the colors and contrast accordingly.  I'm also seeing a slight shadowing effect on the images, so I will need to tweak this even further.Sound is worse than my older set, coming from 2 small speakers on the bottom and possibly 2 on the back, although I suspect those are air vents and not speakers.  Even though I've set it to stereo, it still sounds slightly mono.  There is an audio setting page to adjust the 5 channels, but they seem to have little effect.  Bass and treble are barely there.  I'm considering adding some PC speakers, maybe a subwoofer to boost the sound.This is an ok set to do occasional viewing or maybe a kids room, but if you want a quality picture with good sound, go with a different set.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Little TV", "Author": "salman azad", "ReviewID": "RJZUVE9D72XZ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my kitchen.

I did finally get it attached to the articulating wall mount I bought from Amazon.  It has been in my motorhome traveling around with me for over a year. Once I realized the instructions for mounting the TV and for mounting the bracket to the TV were totally wrong and unreliable... I tossed them aside, then  I spent a few days of \"trial and error\" with the zillion parts supplied with the universal articulating mount.Eventually I ended up with a secure stable mount on the wall and the TV. I am able to adjust it for precise viewing depending on where I want to sit or lay or relax.The TV has awesome color and sound. I use it for both TV reception and I have a computer hooked up to it. Since I mounted mine to the universal articulating wall mount, I was able to toss the heavy table base that came with the TV. The TV itself is very light. It has really been put to the test bouncing down thousands of miles of country roads.Great TV, I think TCL makes a wonderful product, just that this one came with a weird wall mount.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Previous review:I bought this to mount in my motorhome. Forget it!  The \"VESA compatible\" spaces for mounting it are 200mm x 35mm.  There is NOTHING on the market that will fit that mounting pattern. The extension arms on the articulating mount that Amazon insisted would work with it, make the mount too big to mount with only 35mm spacing. I called Amazon 3 times, they kept referring me to another phone number for help, but everyone kept saying the articulating mount bought with it (Amazon Basics) would work and it does not.I called the TCL manufacturer and they were of zero help about the wall mount. They insist it is compatible with standard VESA mounts but it is not.I am extremely frustrated all around with this purchase.It wobbles on the glass base, when assembled and the little legs beneath the glass base fell right off as if never glued on to start with.I have been a shopper at Amazon since they first opened. I am so disappointed all around.I see now why Amazon had it so cheap on Black Friday.The TV itself plays well and has the bonus of a computer hookup, which surprisingly works really well.The sleep timer which is a must-have for me, is very hard to find in the menu, you have to push over 20  buttons to finally access and set it.The TV comes with little LED lights you don't need, but the remote comes with no lights which you do need unless you watch TV with all the bright overhead lights on all the time.Now I have to go to the total hassle of returning the Amazon wall mount they sold me that is worthless and UPS doesn't want to come out to where I am camped in the country, so I have to drive 32 miles to a UPS office to ship it off. I am not at all amused.At this point, I can't decide whether to keep the TV or not. But I have to return the mount that Amazon insists will fit it, but does not.If you buy this TV, just buy it for a table, certainly not for mounting.

Finally, they sent a new remote, and then that didn't solve the problem. The tv is useless because we couldn't set up the tv without the remote. So we call back, being on hold for at least 20 minutes every call, and then they lost our information in the system so we had to start all over. 7 months after our initial calls we received new parts and a shipping label to send back, so it will probably take 3-4 months for us to even use this tv.

The picture is very bright and colors are very rich. Settings are pretty much user-friendly. The tuner is able to pick up regular channels from the cable service, without a box, as well as a fair amount of over-the-air digital channels. The sound is adequate for our bedroom setting, which is where they are located. I'm very glad with the fact that the TV is basically a 12V device so it's pretty efficient at power consumption. I actually bought two of these sets for my kid's bedrooms.There is one thing, however, that has me having second thoughts; it has no standard VESA hookups for a wall mount. There are 4 screw holes on the back of the unit, arranged in a rectangular shape, 35mm apart vertically and 200mm apart horizontally. The TV comes with two small bracket adapters. Each bracket gets attached to each of the vertically-arranged set of screws and, in turn, each bracket provides one screw hole for a wall mount, for a total of 2 screw holes available. This means that, from what I've gathered so far, the TV is supposed to be held by only those two screws, as opposed to 4, like a standard VESA wall mount bracket. I purchased these TV's with the intention of wall-mounting them to save some space. Probably the only reason why I won't give it a 5 star rating of satisfaction is the fact that I haven't been able to locate a suitable wall mount. I even wrote a note on the TCLUSA.com website about the issue, but so far no response.If anyone out there has found away to hang this TV to a wall, that I can't seem to figure out, please let me know.
