I had the extended warranty and was able to get the problem fixed, two weeks later the tv screen started going black every 20 minutes or so.  I again called the tv repair company and they came out and fixed the TV again.. I have had both the power supply, main board, and tv screen fixed and the tv screen is again turning off. I can't believe not even the new parts are working. this is crazy. I paid over 1100 for this tv and It is the worst thing ever.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best picture for the price!", "Author": "RoyBoy", "ReviewID": "R1V59JJ64KWQVL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this item on Cyber monday and I have been wowed ever since. I was looking at other tv's at a store and none with 4 or 5 hundred more dollars on the tag even looked better. I play my video games on it, watch much football and many movies and I have nothing but good to say. I just hope I am still saying this a year from now, I will update if the status changes.", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "I'm happy", "Author": "Pastor Zeb", "ReviewID": "R1CMH69AXFBCFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great price!  What a great TV!  I could have spent more money and gotten a newer model, but this TV had an RCA audio output for connection to my home entertainment center that the others lacked.  (The sound from most flat screen TV's is notoriously poor, and I didn't want to hassle with a sound bar.)  The picture is great, and setup was a breeze.  It was also kinda neat that the delivery guy wanted to stick around and play with it once we got it out of the box!", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Biggest piece of crap ever", "Author": "tony", "ReviewID": "R38VB1BXD9VAZF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on Cyber Monday this year. It shows great specs...1080p,120hs,1ms. The picture should be great! When I set this TV up I was convinced there was something broken inside of it. All the HD channels looked like crap. I even tried a different HDMI cable but it did nothing. Every channel had a blur to it when there was any form of movement...not just on fast moving sports but on a guy eating a frickin sandwhich! I called Amazon to have them send me another one...which they did. So I hooked up my second TV today and it is the same damn thing! I don't understand who in their right mind would want this TV. In all seriousness, this is the worst picture I have ever seen on a television.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Black screen of Death.

I bought it a year and 2 months ago and now the screen is BLACK. I can hear sound but thats about it. Apparently, there is a lot of problems with Philips TVs. Consumer affairs as a never ending list of them.When it did work, it looked great. But I refuse to buy another Philips product again. I cannot believe it DIED one year after I bought it. Unacceptable.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "bugsanderson", "ReviewID": "R3Q6OZO0UWLLPZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tv has great clarity and a wonderful spectrum of colors. For the price it is a fantastic deal. If you are looking for top of the line tv this wont be the tv for you. But if you are looking for a pretty big led this tv is perfect. I play games from xbox on here and they look amazing. The 120 hz is really cool but for the most part unnecessary.

Under $700 for a 1080P/120-hz hdtv is awesome. The quality so far is great. I watch movies and play a lot of black ops on this tv. Picture is awesome. I would buy this tv and brand againCons: tv remote is very basic and boring and the tv speakers are terrible (Not a big deal as most people use universal remotes and surround sound)Lovew this tv!!!!", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "TV", "Author": "wmbarclay", "ReviewID": "R2FL7RP7TX6OW4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV is great and came in perfect condition.

However, after I hooked up my game systems I started to notice ghosting and also it takes about a second in delay from a push of a button on for the tv to register. I played around with the settings and it just gets worse. I've updated the tv seeing if that would fix the problems, and no, nothing. its good for watching tv, but if you're a gamer like myself, don't bother with this junk. I have 40\" LCD is way better and more responsive and I payed a wicked price on that. Stay away from this one not worth the price for what you expect.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love philips tv", "Author": "Jame", "ReviewID": "R2P3W2VRSTLHPM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Used to work for philips and my father has for many years.
