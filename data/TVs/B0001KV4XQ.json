A Bohm", "ReviewID": "R31FJX9XYGZ51B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm giving this product 4 stars, as it is performing much better than I expected! I purchased the Sylvania 19'' TV, as it was the cheapest available to me at the time - but the TV has continued to impress me with it's reliability. The Sylvania has great picture quality - a remote control (with batteries included), stylish silver and black exterior with stereo speakers. We have found the sound quality great for watching every day TV - but we sometimes have to plug into external speakers when watching DVD's for greater viewing quality, and louder bass (we use the awesome Altec Lansing XA3021 2.1 Speakers - 3-Speaker, Black & Silver - you can buy them through Amazon for about $36 - a bargain!)  We have found this TV to be compatible with everything we have attempted to use it with - DVD players, gaming consules - and even our ipod!  Nice big screen too - easy to use. Not a complicated remote control like some of them are these days! Excellent value for money!", "Date": "September 18, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great for a dorm room", "Author": "fdct", "ReviewID": "R1151QV174MI56", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this TV in my dorm room and its great. It's small so it doesn't take up a lot of room, but has a very reasonably sized screen. We use it for movies and video games and it has been great so far. Don't know if I would want it if I was going to watch a lot of TV or something, but for limited use its great.", "Date": "October 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Seven Month Glitch", "Author": "cmp \"cmp\"", "ReviewID": "R3KC17IFX9JKQQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This television performed admirably for 7 months. Great picture and good sound. Now...it begins to \"whistle\" more and more loudly after being on for one hour. It needs to be shut off, allowed to rest, then can be used for another short while. After 90 days any labor must be paid for out of one's own pocket...and any tv repair person will charge at least $80 to just come take a look...You do get what you pay for; I got a nice tv for $14 a month for 7 months! If you can afford something a little better it is worth getting something that is better quality.", "Date": "May 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "I'd put a set in every room of my house!", "Author": "Chris Arniotis", "ReviewID": "R1YXDUAZ8JLCMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This model exceeded my expectations. My Sony of almost 20 years developed wavy lines on the screen and i figured after 4 moves, it was telling me that i'd be viewing the World Cup on someone else.Easy set up and a very simple remote soothed my despair over the loss of a loyal member of the household.Vivid colours and crisp audio, leaves me no choice but to highly endorse this model as a primary viewing set!", "Date": "July 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "J.

Drawbacks: speakers a bit weak and only has a single RCA/game/DVD audio port (no stereo option from these devices).", "Date": "September 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "Kaptivating", "ReviewID": "R1BIYGKKL3TS7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for my 5 year old son's room, and it serves its purpose well. He spends time on weekends and after homework either watching cartoons or playing video games. I have sat in his room and watched him operate the TV through its function for \"game mode\" and show viewing via the remote without a problem. In addition, the TV has front A/V inputs to allow easy access for video game consoles or camcorders. I wouldn't recommend this TV for a primary TV (family room) for your home, but if you're looking for a TV for the bedroom, office, child's room, etc., then this is definitely a TV to consider.", "Date": "November 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great TV, had it 2 yrs and still runs great", "Author": "Gary P \"garyofcourse\"", "ReviewID": "R3K75JF4V515EM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive had this TV for 2 yrs now. Im a college student and bought it coz it was very reasonably priced (Id compared many prices at the time), and also it was a good size. 19\" is big enough for home use, and certainly big enough for a dorm room. Its a simple tv, and has audio, video, and earphone jacks. The picture quality is good. The tv has given me no problems at all in these 2 yrs. Its been subject to rough use, such as regular shifting from one dorm to another every semester, and having friends come over and use it too and it is still running fine.  Also its easy to use, menu systems navigable easily with remote control. So overall I think it is a great product, and I am very glad I bought it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a low cost but good quality tv.", "Date": "January 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Can't Go Wrong", "Author": "W.
