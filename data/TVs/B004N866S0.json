{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Quirky DLNA, underwhelming documentation, but great picture and sound", "Author": "Tommy M.", "ReviewID": "RNIT2X5029J4Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this model over other 32-inch LCDs because I'm a sucker for things like network streaming, a 5-band equalizer, picture-in-picture, and firmware updating. It also has a semi-documented headphone jack in the rear -- just turn off the speakers for it to work. Also, the power cable detaches, so you can replace that yourself.One might dismiss this TV altogether since it doesn't have LED edge lighting, but that tech does not appear to be earning its price premium so far, considering a higher percentage of panel defects, and a black level so intense that detail often gets lost. 60Hz is also not a deal-breaker, since 120Hz tends to only show its strength with sports programming.The picture quality is ultimately subjective, of course. But I found it well above average. Unfortunately, you can't completely disable Dynamic Contrast. The TV will tell you that it's off, but some enterprising Internet detectives at televisioninfo.com have determined that this is a ruse, which leads to some unavoidable light trailing and somewhat crushed blacks. DVDs look surprisingly good, and standard-definition signals look very solid but not outstanding.Dynamic Contrast, Black Tone, Shadow Detail, Edge Enhancement and the noise filters should probably be turned off. Unfortunately, these features can create more problems than they solve; use them sparingly. Like Spider-Man once said, \"With power comes responsibility.\"I have a Roku box connected through HDMI, an Xbox 360 via component, and clear QAM cable TV through the RF antenna jack in the rear. These hookups are going straight into the TV inputs -- no receiver. I figure that this eliminates a testing variable or two. Picture quality and sound was great from all three sources. When I streamed Netflix over Xbox Live, the Xbox appeared to upscale to 1080i. I could not get my 720p Roku box to do this over HDMI.(Edit: I have also now tried a third-party VGA adapter for the Xbox 360. It looks quite good using the console's \"Expanded\" reference level; at least on par with component, and upscaled DVDs look quite good, but not as good as Blu-ray.)Audio is in a better boat, since the SRS functions can actually be turned off (as far as we know). There's also that 5-band equalizer. I thought the TV did surprisingly well for two downward-facing 10-watt speakers, but they won't quite replace dedicated external audio.The D550 doesn't do Internet apps, but this feature is becoming increasingly redundant. As for network sharing, you are not limited to Samsung's proprietary, Windows-only \"PC Share Manager\" software, either. There's a variety of free, multi-platform software that handle networked media libraries. Unfortunately, Samsung appears to have not implemented DLNA according to spec, so you may have trouble getting third-party software to work properly. I had the best experience with TVMobili, which is thankfully free and compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Serviio is also good.In its promotional material, Samsung swears that its Wi-Fi \"LinkStick\" dongle is *required* for wireless networking (and it is not bundled with this TV). This is simply not the case. You can just use a wireless-N Ethernet \"game adapter,\" which can be had for as little as $30 if you shop around. Dongles are also only compatible with a few devices from one manufacturer.(Edit: It's come to my attention that an Intellinet 523974 *might* also work in place of Samsung's official dongle. I cannot directly confirm it, though. It is also reportedly 2.4Ghz, while the dual-band Samsung model adds a 5Ghz option.)The \"E-manual\" built into the TV's menu system isn't very good and is difficult to navigate. The PDF version on their website is... a PDF version of the e-manual. Which is white text on a black background. So much for printing it out...Also, the two-piece pedestal requires a Phillips screwdriver. That's not bad, but the screws required quite a lot of torque to get them all the way in. Also, you need to attach the top part at a certain angle, or else it won't be flush with the base.A note about shipping: Amazon Prime does not currently provide 2-day or next-day shipping for this unit; \"3-5 business days\" is the official line. This is not unusual for products of this size and weight. However, the unit arrived at my door less than 48 hours after I ordered it. So I appreciate Amazon's and UPS's fast service! But your own experience will vary according to your distance from the warehouse and other factors.(Update 4/25: This item is not currently shipped from and sold by Amazon, nor eligible for Amazon Prime. \"Video & Audio Center\" is handling the item instead. I am not familiar with their service, so the previous paragraph does not apply to the current purchase experience. \"3-5 business days\" is still the official shipping time, but I don't know how long it may take this third party to process the order before shipping. It may take a few hours, or a few days. Just a friendly heads-up.)Despite this TV's quirks and poor documentation, I think it gets 5 stars for a really good picture and above-average sound (as long as you tweak that equalizer for some bass). I guess that's what matters most in the end, right?Please leave a comment if I've left you with questions, and I'll answer to the best of my knowledge.--Edit Jan 13 2012--Just reporting in to say that the unit is still performing just fine. It's performed quite well as an interim computer monitor -- just make sure to label the input as \"PC.\" I don't recommend using it as a permanent computer display, because pixel density at this screen size is sub-optimal. (At desktop distance, you don't want larger than 24 inches, assuming a maximum resolution of 1920x1080.) But with some cool-looking wallpaper, its presence is not unwelcome :)However, LG has been pricing their LCDs very aggressively lately, so I recommend researching those units as well.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "D. Acree \"Casual Reveiwer\"", "ReviewID": "R3I664JEB3YB4B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this item a few days ago after doing a multitude of research on flat screen TV's.  Frankly, I was ready to be done!  Our focus was finding a TV with an external width no larger than 37 5/8\".  We were faced with a limited selection of 37\" TV's or some barely close 40\" TV's.  The 40\" TV's that we had to choose from were LED and cost roughly $1000 or more.  Rather than being faced with a close fit of an expensive TV, we decided 37\" would suffice.  Then we were caught between buying a Samsung or a Sony and whether to get LED or LCD.  In my opinion, the Sony brand commands a brand premium in price.  Nice TV's though.  I read a lot about LED v. LCD.  The LCD is still energy efficient and is energy star qualified.  After seeing the picture difference of the LCD and LED.  My wife and I were both okay with LCD.  Then I researched the difference of 60 hz versus 120 hz refresh rates.  Okay, I understand the technical mumbo jumbo of this, but after comparing in a store the difference I couldn't tell.  Maybe my eyes are not good enough anymore.  We also bought the Samsung USB wireless adapter.  I thought from all my reading that this TV had some Internet functionality i.e. Netflix etc.  It DOES NOT.  If you have a Wii or some other game platform that allows internet access - use it and save your money.  The wireless adapter will work with some Samsung Blu-Ray players as well.  The only thing the wireless adapter will do is connect with your pc network and play movies, music, and pictures from your pc.  If this for you - great buy the wireless.  Note:  it has a network interface for wired applications on the back as well.The nitty gritty of the TV.  It works fantastic.  Exceeded expectations on standard definition movies and TV broadcasts.  No dark \"halo\" effects when the picture is dark.  HD works fantastic...almost too clear and crisp to tell the truth.  Works great in the game mode with the Wii.  I know other's have said the sound/speakers were issues, but my family thinks it works just fine.  The PIP(picture in a picture) function only works when viewing programs from two sources i.e. broadcast and DVD.  Not a big user of PIP.  Set up is easy.  Remote is easy and intuitive to use.  The enclosed manual is \"light\" on info.  TV does have a manual you access through TV - it is more in-depth.  For $569 and our first upgrade from a CRT TV - I have no regrets.  TV is great for everyday use - watching broadcast, movies, games, and PC use.  But then again, we didn't need all the bells and whistles of higher end models.  Hope this helps your decision.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best TV I've personally seen in 2010 and 2011", "Author": "Eric Berg", "ReviewID": "R2LAKGLE70Q370", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the last year I've been looking for a TV to replace my 2009 Samsung 26\" LCD. It had what some people call \"smudging\" or \"smearing\" where if two really dark images move near one another, the black area would leave a trail. It looks sort of like when you make a dark circle with a pencil and run your finger over it. It made night scenes in movies and games really distracting. I even saw it in people with black hair watching 720p Lost episodes.From what I can tell so far, this set has none of it. I went through a Sony, a Toshiba, an LG, and another Samsung. All but the LG had this issue, and the LG had atrocious black levels due to it being a technically \"better\" IPS panel. I love my LG IPS monitors, but for TV it looks awful. So I stuck with Samsung's PVA panels, and boy am I glad I did.I immediately turned off all the video processing options and turned the backlight down from 14 to 8. IMPECCABLE picture as far as I'm concerned. Looks incredible even at 1080i. It's no plasma, but hey, 32-inch plasmas don't exist, so I'm content with LCD.I have no idea how the input lag is for video games since I play relatively slowly paced games. No fighters, competitive FPS, or other twitch reflex games in my library. I'd be a bit leery if that's super critical for you until more accurate tests are out there. It seems fine to me, but I'm not very sensitive to lag, so take it with a grain of salt.Bottom line, great picture quality, great black levels (for an LCD), decent motion handling (it IS only 60Hz), lots of options to mess with, plenty of inputs, a sleek design. I would buy this TV again in a heartbeat, personally. As the first reviewer said, JUST what I was looking for.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good TV, excellent as a monitor!", "Author": "Acontius \"Acontius\"", "ReviewID": "R2144NJLI5H7FT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About time.  Here is a TV for 2011.  It is a wonderful TV for a bedroom or other similar space, and it is an excellent monitor for a PC with a good video card, one with DVI or HDMI out.  Colors are very accurate (photography is a serious hobby for my wife and me).As a TV, the hi-def channels look fantastic, what you would expect from a quality set.  Rich colors and excellent contrast.  Standard-def is upscaled very well; Turner Classics looks particularly good on this size set.Mine came with a light to moderate matte screen, not a glossy screen.  The matte effect is very good during daylight hours in my office, while \"glossy\" photos still look sharp and rich.  I think the screen coatings have improved on most TV's the past couple of years, and this TV is a good example.I've got it on my desk, and the size feels just right.  I can have browser windows open that are the size of my old monitor, and in the corner still have a nice sized Windows Media Center with live TV going.  And I can set those browser windows at 100% (instead of 125 - 150%) and still read comfortably!(I remember the days when we would laugh at people who talked about getting a 17\" monitor, and if somebody wanted 19\", they were nuts!)The stand is sturdy, and I like the solid black (instead of the clear stand some are shipping with).  The stand was easier to put together than on another brand that didn't work out as a monitor.Playing video games is about as immersive as it can get.  I see no lag at all.  This is functioning exactly as a monitor.Sound is rich and clear; I was able to take the clunky old PC speakers off my desk.  In fact, I have to keep the volume down now, or my wife, who is studying in the next room, gets distracted.  The sound is a major factor in my satisfaction with this!  I like all kinds of music, but this is especially good with ballads, swing, classical, and jazz.  (Another good reason to have this in a bedroom!)  Older rock without earthquake bass sounds good too!I agree 100% with JA Adams Mullins, another reviewer of this item, who says this is basically a smaller version of the fantastic A650 series, but with 60Hz instead of 120Hz.  As a monitor, as a movie screen for DVD's, and as a TV, this is fantastic.  Yes, I have a 120Hz A650 in my living room, but I have found that the cable company and cable networks are compressing the source material so much that the 120Hz doesn't seem to come into play (and I still haven't upgraded to Blu-Ray).  Also, you can find reasonable opinions that suggest 60Hz is still best for PC games and apps, so, for me, the big savings over the same sized Samsung with 120Hz is a huge factor.Consider NetFlix streaming.  Even with the 120Hz, if I am in full-screen mode, my DSL connection just doesn't pump enough bits to avoid the judder from compression.  But on a monitor this size, I can really enjoy movies in a browser window about half the size of the screen, and the motion is very smooth.There are two types of TV content where the Auto-Smoothing available with 120Hz may be a factor.  One is sports.  In my office, I only have hi-def on the local channels, not on ESPN or other sports channels.  I haven't caught a baseball or golf game on this yet, but when I do, I will report back right here.  The other time I like to ramp up Auto-Smoothing is when watching animation, but at the time of writing this, I haven't been able to watch any cartoons in hi-def. (In standard def, motion in sports and animation looks fine, but standard def isn't pushing any of the processors on this set, for sure.)  Again, after watching on the weekend, I'll report back here.(EDIT:  Update, 5/9/11.  This is fine for sports in high-def, and cartoons look great too.  I haven't hooked it up to a Blu-ray, so no comment possible.  As for PC video games, especially first-person-shooters, this is fantastic.  Before investing in a higher priced 120Hz set for video games, be sure that the set you want to buy actually allows you to enable the auto-smoothing feature while in GAME MODE!  I know auto-smoothing on my 120Hz LN46A650 really helps with movies, sports, and animation; however, most content is looking better on this set than on the LN46A650 without auto smoothing.  In other words, if the two sets are compared without the auto-smoothing enabled on the LN46A650, the action seems smoother on this LN32D550.  BUT, certain movies (e.g. VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER) look MUCH better (that is, smoother and clearer, especially when there is lots of action all over the screen) with the auto-smoothing on the bigger set.  I know this is all very subjective, but I'm trying to point out that it seems very important, if a set claims to run at 120Hz, to be able to activate the smoothing feature.  Since GAME MODE actually disables many processing features to speed up response time, you need to check to make sure any 120Hz set you want does allow the 120Hz to kick in even in GAME MODE (otherwise, the benefit is questionable).For using this as a monitor, just be sure to use the HDMI port in the back and label your connection as either PC (if your video card is HDMI out) or PC DVI (if your video card is DVI out).  This is not just a naming thing, but a real configuration that turns the TV into a monitor.The Samsung LN32D550 really improves the comfort level and pleasure of using my desktop computer for photo editing, writing, researching, and playing.What could be improved? The included eManual is clunky and should be improved a lot or dropped (c'mon, we can download one).  I'd like a little sturdier feel to the power jack in the back.  The carton it shipped in should be beefed up. Finally, I think the clear area of the bezel extends a tad much beyond the main frame.Winding it up, I think this is pretty much a game changer for the TV and monitor markets.  Why should we pay very close to what this costs for a display that only serves as one or the other?One last thing:  Thanks to all the Amazon reviewers and others around the Web who make it possible to zero in on quality and performance in the ocean of choices!", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Everything I was hoping for...", "Author": "J.

I honestly did not expect this for $629.The only possible issues are:1) The black becomes dark blue if viewed from the angle. This is common problem for LCDs, and I think that as LCD TV goes, it is very minor effect (it is very even dark blue background, noticeable when you view TV at around 30 degree of axis), but some other TVs (like plasma or projection TVs) do not have it by design.2) While piano black design is very nice to look at, if you have source of light behind you, you will see some reflection from the edge of the screen, which may be a bit destructing. True, though, if you watch TV, you should not have sources of light behind you anyway, still, this may be a small factor on your choice of the TV.3) This is 60Hz model, so, for fast moving images this is not the best TV (consider 120Hz ones, but it costs $$)That's it!

To be fair, I have not used all of the features; however my primary use is to watch tv (i.e. not use it as a monitor or for gaming as others mentioned).Pros:  really clear picture, vibrant colors, and super easy to set up.  It also has extra features like sleep timer, the ability to program the tv on and off, and the screen automatically dims to adjust to the lighting of the room (e.g., if you are watching tv in an unlit room, the picture darkens so that it's not glaringly bright).  I also like the idea that if I want to use it for other purposes besides tv watching, there are a lot unexplored options that other reviewers discussed.Cons:  the speakers are located in the back so the sound comes across as somewhat \"tinny\", even after changing the settings for my personal preferences. I have considered the possibility that the \"tinniness\" may have to do with where it is located (in an alcove); however I feel it's more about the tv's design and the speaker placement since I haven't experienced this problem before with other tvs. I haven't run the sound through an external speaker system yet so I am hoping that will alleviate this issue.My biggest complaint that was not mentioned in any of the reviews was the issue of closed captioning.  [Updated information as of 11/5/11:  Originally I thought the closed captioning did not work at all with the tv.  So it made no sense that there was a cc button on the remote because the message always said it was \"not available\" when you pushed the button (and this wasn't because the tv program did not broadcast in cc).  However, I discovered that if you don't have a cable box and the tv is connected directly to the cable line, then you can use the option of closed captioning through the tv.  But if the tv is connected to a cable box via component or HDMI, then the only way to access cc is to go through your cable box and enable and disable it that way].  It's a minor process to do it but inconvenient.  Once you enable it through the cable box, cc always remains on whether the tv is on mute or has sound.  There is no cc on mute only.And speaking of mute, when you do mute the tv, the mute icon remains on the tv screen.  It also travels up and down the left side of the screen which becomes distracting after a while.  Unfortunately there is no way to change that either.Bottom line: If you aren't particular about sound quality and don't care about closed captioning and mute, then you will probably be satisfied overall.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV Excellent Value!", "Author": "Jonathan Harris \"DUCK\"", "ReviewID": "RIWX40PZZEM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is amazing!  I could not be happier!When I was shopping for a new TV after my old tube TV finally started dying, I knew I wanted a Samsung.  Why?  I've yet to have any problems with their products - they seem to be well designed and well built to last.  I also notice subtle nuances, such as the \"Inspected by ___\" sticker on Samsung products will have a person's name and not a number.  Can you imagine the difference that makes when you're standing on a production line 30-40 hours a week and you get to put your name on a product being shipped globally, knowing that someone will see your name instead of some nameless number?  It's things like that that make their products better, by making employees feel valued, which in turn makes customers feel valued.I was confused by all of the refresh rates and things that aren't a part of tube television.  As you all can see, this TV is at 60Hz instead of 120Hz or even upwards of 600Hz.  Is this problematic?  Absolutely not!  After conducting research, I found out that all signals in North America coming into your television are at 60Hz.  Even Blu-Ray is coming in a 1080p 60Hz, which is exactly what this TV is - 1080p 60Hz.  Why 120Hz and higher?  I'll answer this in two ways.  Number 1: Why does car wax smell good?  The car can't smell it.  The smell doesn't improve the car wax.  Many times over, companies add in features that make the customer feel as though they need it, simply in order to charge more money for the product.  Microsoft is notorious for this with their Office suites.  Number 2: In the early days of LCD/LED/Plasma technology, there was an issue processing the signal coming in, that ended up in a sometimes un-smooth signal or \"judder\".  Since then, this technology has been fixed and we no longer experience this problem, but in the meantime companies decided to make TV's at twice the refresh rate in order to insert frames - not make the picture better, but make it smoother - and sometimes ends up in the picture looking too smooth.  You know what I'm talking about when you've looked at a new TV and thought, \"People don't move like that...this is weird...\"  Absolutely not an issue with this TV - everything looks natural.This is a high-quality TV from Samsung in full HD, with deep and rich colours, at a glorious price.

I supposed this is a better alternative to metal screws that may wear over time.Usage:I am using an HDMI cable that I bought from Amazon. I don't know why it seems choppy/pixelated sometimes. This could just be from my AT&T; U-verse Cable box or the channel itself. I'm also wondering if certain HDMI cables work better than others...perhaps the $120 ones that can handle faster refresh rates? Although I'm not so thrilled about spending another $100 for a mere cable...For gaming, I currently have my Wii hooked up to it via regular A/V cables. I had to mess with the settings to get it to display to my liking. I tried out The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask and it seemed to be too dark on dynamic settings. So I needed to customize the brightness in order to even play in some areas of the game. But since this game is pretty dated I imagine newer HD games will not have such a problem.Sound:I have a pretty small room so I don't really require the sound to be very high. Usually set between 15 and 25. I don't think this TV will sound so great in a large living room. But for my small 12x12 ft bedroom it's just right.Dislikes:- I did not like how the screen wobbles if touched/held too much- I have my Wii hooked up via A/V cables and if I turn it off the TV needs to be reminded of what its source was. I can hear the Wii menu but not see it so I needed to re-select the A/V source. This can be a bit bothersome.Will add more to this after more usage...Edit June 30:I have found that in addition to not registering my Wii the TV also has trouble with my cable box. At first it won't display anything and claims the power to the box may not be on (when it clearly is). I have to turn the TV on and off, making sure it is still on the HDMI input when it first turns on. This can be very annoying especially at the end of a long day when all I want to do is watch TV! I am unsure if it's the TV or my cable box itself that is the problem (AT&T; U-Verse, ugh) so it might be unfair to blame the TV, although since it does the same thing to my Wii it probably is at fault.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just a great TV", "Author": "W.S.", "ReviewID": "RXTOYVV0W2HFI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the second Samsung HDTV that I have purchased directly through Amazon.Both units worked perfectly \"right out of the box\" and with minimum hassle.The picture and sound qualities are excellent on both, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase(s).The only concern with this delivery was a hole(actually two)in the side of the carton, which turned out to be on the face side of the TV.

The #1 concern I had while shopping for a TV was input lag. I went over to the AVS forums and hung around their \"input lag wars\" thread and did some heavy reading and research on the TV's they were recommending there. Someone suggested that the new 2011 Samsung models were looking good so off to Amazon I went.Straight out of the box I set up my TV and connected it to my Xbox via HDMI. I popped in Marvel vs Capcom 3 grabbed my TE fightstick and tried out a few combos. I noticed there was a very minuscule delay when I pressed a button and it made me frown a little. Keep in mind all I did at this point was set up the TV right out the box without doing any configurations to the TV itself. I knew that most Samsungs have a \"game mode\" setting which turns off some of some of the  frame processing features in the tv therefore minimizing input lag so I went to Menu > Settings > General > Game mode ON and crossed my fingers. SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE. The game mode eliminated any input lag that I felt and gave me such a sigh of relief. Each button press had an instant reaction and my team was DHC'ing, OTG'ing, Level 3 x-factor Sentinel frying pan the computer with ease!For my next test I threw in Halo: Reach and hopped into the MLG playlist. The TV produced beautiful colors, deep blacks, and most importantly no input lag. DMR shots were straight and steady and did great on the FPS end.If you are a competitive gamer and concerned about input lag like me, then I 100% suggest you get this TV. It has performed very well in the games I played and remember you NEED to turn the game mode ON to eliminate any input lag!Note: The neck stand for this TV is black and not the clear plastic that Amazon has in the description picture.

Several options for sounds, picture, quality are at your fingertips.

The box has two long pieces of foam to hold the tv securely, indicating which end is up. Make sure you REMOVE both pieces as parts to the base of the stand are inside the one at the other end, completely out of eyesight unless you pull out the foam.I found the sound a bit tinny after trying out all choices; srs, movie, basic..but also noted with srs (surround sound) it wasn't that bad.  I have Bose external theater speakers so didn't really care much about the sounds.  What I did care about is finding that my Bose system wasn't compatible with the newer models of HDTV so had to get a RCA dual  adapter.  Pay the 12-13 dollars and get a good one or else the speakers will hum like crazy, distorting everything.Using any other device , connecting with a hdmi cable is idiot proof.  End one to tv, end two to the dvd, roku, or any device that has this sort of connection.  Then you just hit source on the tv's remote control and scroll down to your hdmi 1, hdmi2,hdmi3  etc and there is your other sources.  Click on it and your dvd is ready to play on the screen.My dvd isn't blue ray but over this tv I was amazed how wonderful the picture quality was.

Not interested in the LED stuff, since this was just for the bedroom(the movie room has a Sharp LC60LE835U set); not interested in the 120 Hz or higher either, since I wouldn't be watching big sports events or have a whole family movie night in front of it.This little Samsung has everything I needed:*****Fits exactly in the space allotted on the wall;*****The picture quality is Excellent.**** The TV is mounted on the wall, and the viewing position is about 10-12 feet away.

Using WMP as a DLNA server(in Windows 7), the TV finds all the AVI(Divx/xvid) shows on my network with no problem and plays them flawlessly. I have also tried PS3Media Server, a free application, which also works with no problems. It does not play MKV files over DLNA, however, that is not a limitation of the TV, but a limitation with the DLNA implementation. The TV plays MKV files off an USB drive with no problems(I have tried an USB stick,8GB, and a Western Digital portable hard drive). Music and pictures play with no issues as well using DLNA or USB.EDIT; 1/1/13TV still works like new, no issues. Just wanted to add that you can play MKV's via an Ethernet cable, using a media server like PS3MediaServer for example.

I bought this TV mainly because of the other 5 star ratings I found here on Amazon. I found a few that said there is no button lag for video games especially on PS3 versus some of the other brands out there. I didn't want to spring for the cheaper alternatives out there just to test the theory out, so I just delved right into this one because others have already admitted no issues with this one at all.

There are plenty of options to customize it if you are not satisfied with its original settings. Also, the sound isn't as bad as I thought it would be, considering the speakers are placed on the back of the TV. It's great for a small to medium sized bedroom, but probably not for a large living room though. I'm not sure if the sound would resonate enough in a larger setting.I'm pretty sure most people don't like that only one of the HDMI ports is on the back, and the other three are on the side, but it doesn't really bother me at all. It's actually convenient for me because I place my DVD player and PS3 on the the side anyhow.The three HDMI side ports are on the right side of the TV when looking at it from the front, just for those of you who are curious about that.

I was unable to present an invoice or receipt or proof of purchase, and merely provided the serial number and mentioned that it was purchased on Amazon.  Within a few days, Samsung sent a technician to my home for free, and the problem was solved quickly even though the warranty period may have expired.  So my experience was that Samsung did indeed stand behind its product.  Its possible that others might have had a different experience, or that Samsung recently improved its customer service in response to complaints.My only disappointment in the LN46D550 was that it did not have a headphone jack, but I did work around this by connecting the audio out from the TV through my receiver, and using the receiver's headphone jack.

I upgraded from a Samsung 19 inch 720p LCD TV and what a difference it has been. The TV itself is beautiful and the plastic around the frame makes it even more attractive. Movies, video games and cable programming look really great. The sound is impressive considering some TV's have poor sound quality. The SRS audio feature is awesome but it can only be used for regular TV programming but not for cable programming or gaming. Having 4 HDMI ports is impressive. I love being able to play music and videos and view photos from either a USB flash drive or external HDD. The TV also has a picture-in-picture feature which is another bonus. The base is very sturdy. The screws need to be put in very precise and require a lot of pressure in order to fit. I did wish that TV supported Internet Apps but it doesn't. The Ethernet port is basically used for firmware updates. I do have a 15 ft HDMI cable running from the graphics card to the TV so I watch Youtube videos and play PC games on the TV.

Since getting this TV I have used many newer, bigger, supposedly better, full featured TVs, but none even come close to this one. I haven't had great experiences with Samsung's phones, computers, or MP3 players, but they make the best TV by far.The picture is as good of quality as my eyes can see with deep dark blacks, bright whites, and vibrant colors. I watch a lot of football and play a lot of video games and the 60Hz refresh rate is plenty fast enough to keep up with the action. No tearing or skipping. It also has Game Mode for bypassing hardware and helping video games look even smoother.32-inches is the perfect size. It can be seen from far away and is easy to look at close up. A lot of Hi-def TVs have weak speakers. This TVs speakers can be heard throughout my house and they sound great. Alternatively you can use external speakers with the optical connection or a 3.5mm jack.The TV part of this TV is unmatched by any other TV out there, but what makes this TV the best on the market is all the little things. Samsung goes above and beyond providing just a good picture. The user interface is intuitive and well designed. Everything is adjustable and the remote makes it simple to adjust settings on the fly for fine tuning. Samsung is always releasing updates to the TV's drivers to make it better. It has picture in picture. It works well as a computer monitor. It has plenty of HDMI and USB inputs along with legacy inputs such as component and VGA. The buttons are sensors instead of mechanical. The design is sleek and modern looking.It can read harddrives and flash drives and it can play movies, play music, and view photos of all file types. I have a 64GB flash drive with my entire movie library on it. If I want to watch a movie I navigate to the flash drive and select the movie. No more DVD/BluRay players, no more shelves of discs, no more physical media; just one flash drive that is always plugged into the back of the TV.I would highly recommend this TV or any other Samsung hi definition television.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect size", "Author": "MNSeabreeze", "ReviewID": "R19VWTLRXYRY3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 37 inch is the perfect size for small room.

So far, I am quite happy with my purchase. I was looking to buy a moderately priced TV to replace an older 26\" Zenith tube model and this one certainly checked off all the boxes.  It offers alot of features for the money and is made by a reputable name brand that has a good track record.  Best Buy had this TV as an instore special for $549, reduced from $700.  What really sold me was that when I was comparing the picture quality of a variety of models which were on display at Best Buy, this model stood out as superior with respect to the picture quality.  Many of the other TVs, whether name brands or not, had very washed out colors whereas the Samsung was vibrant and crisp.My setup includes an HD cable box as well as an older Samsung VCR combo box and a Sony DVD player.  Best Buy delivered and set up the TV in about 10 minutes.  The design is sleek and blends in well with any type of room decor. This TV has plenty of connectivity options to easily handle all my peripherals with plenty of room for expandability.  The picture quality is stunning with rich colors and crisp resolution.  The HD cable box dramatically improved the picture quality when compared to the grainy quality I originally got when hooked up to the standard digital cable box I used for a few days before I got my HD box.  I was also pleasantly surprised that there are plenty of adjustment options so that you can fine tune the picture and sound quality to your individual preference.  The online menu options are fairly easy to navigate with the help of the included TV manual which gives enough explanatory information so that most users should be able to set the adjustments they need.  I cannot comment on the Internet capabilities as I presently do not utilize that, although I am aware that the purchase of an adapter is required to use that feature. I do not notice any distortion when I view the TV off center or from an angle, which I know is a problem with alot of LCD TVs.Many people have commented on the somewhat tinny sound quality from the rear speaker placement, but I have found that selecting the Movie sound setting adds more bass and depth which evens out the overall tone and makes it more resonant. I also notice a distinct improvement is achieved when viewing an HD program on the dedicated HD broadcast channel rather than on the standard broadcast channel.  I would rate the sound quality as quite adequate for a small or medium sized room as even on a lower setting, the volume is quite loud in my modestly sized living room.I have not experienced any difficulties with this TV, although I have only had it for a week.

Apparently it's not possible to adjust the noise reduction on this TV (as with other HDTVs), so I've tried changing the contrast, sharpness, etc., but not surprisingly that doesn't make a difference.There's also considerable ghosting (I think that's the term), so a faint halo appears around the edges of text and just about everything else.Sound quality is also strange, I guess because we're used to the bigger speakers in the CRT.

I also picked up a pair of Turtle Beach PX21 Headset, and I also put this in the side of the TV, to make it easy to get out.  The HDMI on the side is great for connecting my laptop to my TV for video or gaming playback.2 Composite AV is great because I have my PSP hooked up to my TV, and if I have another device to hook up.  Another Component Audio cable in the back, 3 HDMI slots in the back of the TV, great for both of my PS3's and my DVR box.There is not a thing I can say badly about this TV, awesome picture, now a much cheaper price than the $1,000 I paid for it, but it was and is still worth every penny I paid for it.

A while back I owned a JVC LT-32J300 but unfortunately I had to sell it and go back to using an old Zenith CRT HD set. Recently I picked this model up at best buy. At $550 I'd consider this a reasonable price for a 40\" LCD with full 1080p. The picture quality is very good (I will say the picture quality on the JVC was slightly better but that could be due to the size of the screen or other features). The colors really stand out and there is a lot of crisp clear detail. One thing I did notice is sometimes you can see a bit of black crush but this only seems to happen during really dark scenes and I've never really been bothered by this. At first I did not think this TV any any composite plugs. On the back it just appears to have two component plugs. However after reading the manual I found out that the green component plug doubles as the yellow composite plug. There are still only two of these ports in the back but it's nice to have both options. I watched some of an old VHS tape that I have and despite the degraded quality of the tape the picture still look quite good in both 4:3 and stretched to 16:9. Aside from the two component/composite plugs there are plenty of HDMI/DVI ports for all of your other HD devices.At first I would have thought the sound quality wouldn't be that good since from what I can tell the speakers are in the back. This was obviously done to make the front bezel of the TV as small as possible. But despite this the sound quality is very good and I don't have to turn most things about 20 to get good clear sound. The voice on Blade Runner was a bit soft but this probably wasn't the fault of the TV.Now there are some features on this set that I haven't used like the DLNA or any of the web enabled features as I don't have a way to hook it up to a wired internet connection. Right now the only things connected to the TV are an Xbox 360 and an Insignia Blu-Ray player. I have also watched a few upscaled DVDs and the picture quality on this set really improves the overall quality of the DVD.Probably my biggest complaint about the TV is the stand. When I put this together I noticed that a couple of the screws didn't really go in all the way and the stand seemed a bit loose. When I set the TV down on the TV stand I noticed it wasn't very hard to make it wobble from side to side. Now the stand is nice and adjustable so you can turn the TV any way that you need so you can see it. But given the viewing angle of this set you won't really need to do that and it's possible the problems I had with the stand were either due to bad screws or me just not sitting everything right.In conclusion:Pros: great picture quality, very good sound quality, good set of features, slim profile, HD and non-HD plugsCons: stand is a little unsteadySo if you are looking for a great 40\" LCD set at a reasonable price I'd definitely give this one a look.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "A.

I've got the TV hooked up to my PlayStation 3, games and movies look amazing on it! The picture quality is brilliant! The screen size, at 37 inches, is definitely big enough for you to notice all of the little details in a picture.

However, after a week I returned the set. This TV had two picture quality issues I just couldn't get over. I'm surprised with this outcome because I don't consider myself very picky when it comes to picture quality.First, some colors, especially purples, were over-bright sometimes to the point of giving the picture a cartoonish quality. I spent hours adjusting the TV, both by trial-and-error and by using picture setting configurations posted on line by pros for this TV, but I never could come up with a satisfactory picture. My parents have a similar Samsung LCD TV that is a couple of years old. The picture on their TV is fine using the default settings (I tried their settings on my TV as well).Second, the picture quality degrades noticeably when viewed off-angle. The TV has a pronounced \"sweet spot\". Any viewers who are not directly in front of the TV are out-of-luck. This is a weakness of LCD TVs in general, but especially bad on this model.Prior to buying, I viewed this model in a retail store. It looked fine there. The retailer was displaying cherry-picked material that would look good on any TV, however, so I didn't see these flaws until I used the TV in a more realistic environment.Besides the picture, everything else about the TV was ok.Vanns handled my order and they deserve 10 stars.

I was eager to see the set in action because this was my household's first HDTV, heck, the first panel that was flat and didn't weigh 40 + pounds. I researched this set, along with dozens of others, before narrowing down my wish list to 3 sets from different manufacturers. Each set was highly rated on Amazon and Consumer Reports, so the last thing I expected was a problem.At first, the tv worked fine; however, I was somewhat disappointed with the colors when I saw the screen light up for the first time. I remember walking through many electronics retailers and seeing more vibrant pictures for televisions of the same size, and equal to or less than the price I paid. I dismissed my concern as a matter of me being unable to alter the color settings to a more agreeable picture.In early March, the tv began to show two vertical lines that were running from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen. They are not always noticeable, but they are lighter in color compared to the rest of the screen, and consistently reappear in the same spots on the screen during nighttime shots in films or on shows. I contacted Samsung, and they do what every customer service department does for companies, blamed me, my cable company, and the wires and accessories I use with my set (DVD players, Video game systems, etc.)I waited to see if the problem would disappear but it did not. It is now June and I am shipping my set to Samsung in NJ to make them figure it out. They told me if they find nothing wrong with it, I have to pay $80.00 for shipping. Something tells me my future is looking grim with this set.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Marina", "Author": "Marina Sennet", "ReviewID": "R2YPC76XWQ2ZF1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES would I EVER Buy a Samsung TV again!

Box undamaged, TV not visibly damaged.  Set it up and turned it on and discovered the screen had shattered inside the panel. It was unwatchable.  Called Amazon who opened a case and promised to get back to me in 24 hours.  Called Samsung who told me that I was on my own since this was an \"internal failure\" and not covered at all by Samsung (what other kind of problem can a TV have except an \"internal failure\").Five years ago I bought another Samsung 52 inch LCD TV. Two years later it died with the same capacitor defect that many other Samsung owners had also experienced with this model.  Again Samsung told me it was not covered.  Samsung service wanted $1500 to fix it.  But yesterday I also learned that Samsung had lost a Class Action Lawsuit by its customers (Google: Samsung Capacitor Class Action) and had been forced to fix this problem for everyone at Samsung's expense.  I had never been advised of this remedy by Samsung even though the product was registered with Samsung and I had placed a service ticket with Samsung on the problem.So be cautious before buying Samsung.  They TV's are great when they work.  When they stop working you are on your own.Amazon just sent me an email confirming they will replace the LN37D550K.

I had a 47\" Magnavox that cratered in 3 years and I was devastated, so instead of having it fixed I just purchased a Samsung.  I was very happy with the Magnavox and sorry it gave out.  The Samsung is nice, but it lacks some really neat features that the Magnavox had, such as;  Samsung does not show what is playing on each channel; letters too small to read; CC cannot be read by me.  Letters not clear, after trying for some time to get the sound to mono instead of stereo I chatted with person on line from Samsung chat and he said I couldn't change the sound on digital.  That is totally ridiculous and I can't believe that Samsung would be that short-sighted.  The Samsung is 46\" and the Magnavox was 47\".  I really didn't think there would be any difference but found out I was wrong again.  The Magavox had much better color and picture.  I guess the only thing I can hope for is that the Samsung will last much longer than 3 years.  I can only hope.BTW, It was set to arrive on a certain day and I waited all day and never heard a word.  I finally called the company that was sending it and it had arrived here the day before and I should have been called then to deliver it the next day.
