{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony Bravia KDL-32EX720", "Author": "Ninjawithagun", "ReviewID": "R2R4TN73C4IDTX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Sony Bravia EX720 from a local electronics store (and not Amazon, since I prefer to make large electronic purchases locally in the event I need to quickly return and exchange a defective item).  Overall, the TV is good, but not great.  Here is a quick down and dirty list of \"in my opinion (IMO)\" pros and cons:Pros:- High quality LED side-lit LCD screen- True 1080P 3D and Hi-definition capable, but with some limitations- Colors and contrast are vibrant, once you take the time to manually adjust the picture settings- Built-in 3D transmitter; no need to buy the external transmitter which saves you about $35- 3D effects are very good overall, but best results can only be attained by watching 3D Blu Ray movies- Artifical 3D option in the 3D options works decently and provides an alternative to playing PC games in 3D without having to use the NVidia 3D Vision or 3DTV Play drivers; this allows you to maintain up to 60fps frame rates without have to revert to a 24hz (24fps) refresh rate- No 3D ghosting evident, but you may need to make manual adjustments to the depth effect - I needed to do this- 4 x HDMI 1.4 ports- Internet capable right out of the box- Swivel and 6 degree backward tilt adjustable- Directly compatible with the Sony PS3 (shouldn't be a surprise since it is a Sony TV)- TV firmware can be updated, but does require internet connectivity- Weight of TV is 25lbs - very light and easy to move or mount on wall without worry of mounting screws tearing out of the studs in the wall!- Shortcut keys on the Remote are very convenient and will save you time from having to dig down into the sub-menus everytime just to make adjustments to certain functionsCons:- NOT a 240hz 3D TV; Sony.com website lists the specifications for this model as \"120hz\" refresh rate (AMAZON NEEDS TO FIX THE LISTED DESCRIPTION FOR THIS TV NOW!)- Had to contact Sony customer support directly to verify which Sony 3D glasses model is compatible with the KDL-32EX720; their website did not provide this information; confirmed with the tech rep that the TDGBR100/B version is compatible with the KDL-32EX720; important to note the \"B\"  Think of it as the \"B\" represents \"Bravia\" :)- 3D viewing @ 1080P limited to only 24hz and 30hz??  24hz = 24fps & 30hz = 30fps  That's not a problem for watching 3D Blu Ray movies (or watching converted 2D movies into 3D), but is not acceptable if you want to play computer games on this TV; part of the reason why I bought it- Takes a few hours to manually adjust the picture just the way you want it; you will need to go into the \"Advanced Settings\" to change things like White Balance, Black Level correction, Edge enhancement, etc.- Priced a bit high for not having 3D glasses included or a 240hz refresh rate; WARNING! The glasses cost $150 separately O.o- Power cord is hard-wired into the TV; would have preferred a universal power cord solution so that it could be replaced easily should it get damaged- Remote control is a bit clunky and large and does not provide universal remote functionality as it only allows for control of the TV; unlike other remotes that allow you to conrol several devices - a universal remote function would have been nice for me because I could have used the remote to control both the TV and my Sony PS3; not sure why Sony would not allow for this other than to make more money from their customers...no way!  lolBOTTOMLINE:Depending on your intentions of what the primary use of this TV is/are will ultimately determine your final decision to buy it or not.  If you plan to watch regular and 3D Blu Ray movies and like the convenience of the integrated internet functionality, then this TV is a good choice, albeit a bit expensive when considering you have to pay $150 more for the 3D glasses.  The picture quality when watching Blu Ray movies is excellent and there are lots of options to configure the picture appearance according to your specific tastes/preferences.  Think of it as adjusting the driver's seat on a brand new car that you are thinking of buying.  You really don't know exactly the right settings until you have had it for a while, but when you do figure it out, the ride was well worth the wait.I would NOT recommend you buy this TV if you plan to do serious 3D computer gaming on it.  I highly recommend you wait for the new 27\" and larger \"true\" 120hz 3D monitors coming out later this year.  Because of the limitations of the frame rates when using 3D mode on this TV, I've decided to keep my Alienware OptX AW2310 3D computer monitor so that I can get the best 3D experience while PC gaming.To those who are a bit more serious about there hardware and do not want to compromise, I would highly recommend you wait to buy the 240hz or 480hz version of this TV (not yet released) and maybe even wait for HDMI 1.5 which is rumored to support 3D (stereo) 1080P @ 60hz :)Overall, the Sony Bravia KDL-32EX720 is a very good, but not great 3D TV that seems to be the \"Jack of All\", but the \"Master of None\".", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Review from a not-really-super-techy guy", "Author": "abe", "ReviewID": "R2HYJ235ZBV9PY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*UPDATE* May 19, 2011I've had this TV for over a month now, and just wanted to provide an update:Picture: CUSTOM SETTINGS! Out-of-the-box, the picture isn't the best quality. There is some graininess, a noticeable soap opera effect and some blockiness with moving pictures. EVERY owner should calibrate the settings to their liking. Also, it's very important to turn off the ECO sensor -- your TV will be much, much brighter. I followed the custom settings on flatpanelshd.com, where the reviewer tweaked the settings for best picture output, down to advanced settings like B-Gain and R-Gain. From there I messed around with the other settings until I found a picture I'm very happy with.Comparison: Two of my friends bought a 55-inch LG LW5600 and I've spent a good time watching their TVs. The LG uses passive 3D so the glasses are super cheap and comfortable -- I hate to say it, but the 3D on that TV probably looks better overall. They also brag about an 8 million to 1 contrast ratio whereas the Sony EX720 is 2 million to 1. What that means is the LG has a brighter range of vivid colors. BUT after tweaking my settings, I was able to get comparable color results AND the picture on the Sony is noticeably clearer -- you couldn't get a soap opera effect on the LG if you tried. The MotionFlow 240 actually seems to make a difference as I can see wrinkles on The Most Interesting Man in the World's face that I couldn't see on the LG. Plus the LG had a lot of choppiness when watching sports, it might have been the cable or the TV's 120hz processor.Still a five-star rating for a clearer picture than the LG and enhanced picture with tweaked settings. Original review below.*From April*Picture: Very good. Granted I was watching a 37-inch LCD that was almost six years old, so even watching a crayon drawing on wax paper would be an upgrade. But I watched ESPN HD, Avatar HD in HBO and a bunch of other random things. There was no noticeable clouding (blobs of light on the screen) at all. I was pleasantly surprised that there really wasn't a soap opera effect on the movies and shows I watched.More Picture: It's true that this isn't a \"true\" 240hz TV. It's marketed as a MotionFlow 240hz, which basically means that it's 120hz but has some sort of technology that Sony made up to \"bring the frame rate up to 240hz.\" That being said, I probably wouldn't be able to notice the difference between 120 and 240hz anyway. I do wish the picture was a little bit brighter, but it's super easy to adjust the settings. Also, the black levels weren't as black as I'd like. When watching a show with a lot of black screen, it still looks a little gray compared to the black frame lining the TV.Sound: GREAT. You know how sometimes you're watching a DVD or a TV show and the music and background noises are super loud and the voices and dialogue are super quiet, and then you have to turn up the volume to hear the dialogue, but then quickly turn it back down because some booming music scares the crap out of you? Not so with this TV. Apparently it's got some technology that detects dialog and will automatically soften the background sound and amplify the voices. Plus, when you change the sound setting to \"S-Force Front Surround,\" there really is a noticeable difference in the quality, the sound does seem to echo more under this setting.3D: Suh-weeeeet! Ok, there are definite cross-talk issues -- which is a term I learned by reading a bunch of reviews. You will see double images at certain points, but EVERY TV review I read suffers from this issue because it's a new technology. My DirecTV offered four 3D channels, one was a nature show channel that rotates shows about dinosaurs, ocean life, and space stuff. I spent four hours straight watching this channel and now know a bunch of random facts about dinosaurs, ocean life and space stuff. I invited three people over and the four of us watched this channel for hours. There were parts of the ocean documentary where schools of fish looked like they were a few feet out of the screen. And a freaking Brontosaurus totally peered into my living room -- I wanted to pet him. Even on large landscape pans, the depth perception was amazing.Remote: Effin' BRILLIANT. I don't know why, but instantaneous response from the remote made me pretty damn happy. I had Time Warner Cable TV before, and it would do some crap where you'd be pressing the remote buttons and nothing would happen, and then like 15 seconds later everything you pushed would happen at once. DirecTV is better but would still lag sometimes. But this TV and it's default remote are like sweet lovers that orgasm at the same time. There is no lag time and the interface screen is ridiculously simple to use and navigate -- even for not-really-super-techy-guys.Interface and Settings: Awesome. Navigating the settings is intuitive and simple -- it looks a lot like the PS3 interface. Everything's is laid out in Layman's terms and spelled out so clearly that even A GIRL would have no problems using it. There's even little features like naming the different display inputs AND ADDING AN ICON TO THEM?? So now when I change Display modes between DVD, DirecTV and Xbox, it very coolly displays those titles on the screen, AND HAS THE ICON I PICKED NEXT TO THEM! W00T! And changing the settings is cake. You can go directly into many of the main settings (like display, sound, etc) directly from the show you're watching instead of going into the menu.Wireless and Internet Apps: This does NOT come in with built-in WiFi, but I plugged it directly into my router with a network cable. Done dada. I was getting good connection speeds with Youtube, Qriocity and Hulu. My only complaint is that it probably takes a little getting used to spell anything out -- kind of a weird alphanumeric style that you'd get when you spell something out using a numeric phone keypad.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent 2d TV neither best or worse 120hz option for 3DHDTV", "Author": "Jonathan M Osment", "ReviewID": "R1ZURQQXYQYY6R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE 3/30/2011: Amazon has removed the 240hz tag from the product title but not the \"whats in the box\" section. As this 120hz product is no longer being incorrectly advertised as 240hz, I am re-adjusting the rating.WARNING: Possible Deal breaker concerning this TV.NOTICE: As of 3/24/2011, I noticed via the Sony Style website that they state the EX720 is now only 120hz, not this advertised 240hz. I hope this is a typo on Sony's end but if it is not, there is a serious case of false advertisement going on. I was specifically on the market to purchase a 240hz HDTV, as the price tag warrants it, and thus this may change the satisfaction level of this review. Before you purchase this product, make sure you know there may be a case of false information taking place regarding the refresh rate.Update: It is confirmed that the this HDTV is NOT 240hz as advertised. It is only 120hz. The rating has been adjusted purely because it is false marketing and reveals little improvement over previous models which cost much less. One of the main reasons to get a 240hz HDTV for 3D is that you get 120hz per eye as the image flickers back and forth. If the refresh rate of the TV itself is only 120hz, this means you are only getting the 60hz experience when watching 3D. 60hz is what we are trying to get away from.There is absolutely no excuse for false advertising, higher costs for features not present. If you are looking to get a 3D TV, make sure it is absolutely 240hz or else you are just wasting your money. If you want a TV but dont plan on using the 3D features, then this unit is ok but there are cheaper and better alternatives in that case.***Updated - Old Review:The Sony Bravia 40EX720 is a decent 3D HDTV.I was originally on the market for a HDTV in which to use as a computer monitor/gaming screen and after Sony revealed its 2011 lineup at CES 2011, I knew I had to get one.The first thing I can tell you is that this TV is solid. I felt quite satisfied with the build quality (a bit of cheap plastic on the back, but I have yet to find a LED LCD HDTV that didnt have that feeling). Unlike the previous EX series HDTVs, the bevel on the bottom which looks grey in some pictures is actually a dark black. This was actually a downer for me as I kind of liked the grey strip on the bottom as seen in some EX7xx pictures. I love the menu system, it is a modified version of the 2010 menu system. The 2010 line of Bravia HDTVs made use of the Playstation 3 and PSP menu system to the point where they were practically identical. The EX720, and by my guess all the 2011 models, opted out of the PS3/PSP menu design in favor of a more streamlined version. It grows on you and generally I find it much more visually appealing and easy to navigate.The remote is perhaps the best thing this tv has going for it. It has some handy buttons that work better than one would expect. The 3D button on the remote turns the tv into stereoscopic 3D mode, one more press and it turns it off. You can watch anything in 3D as the Bravia will emulate the 3D effect for non-3D content. Other remote buttons include a quick netflix toggle, internet video, Qriocity as well as a very handy HOME button.The internet video works like a charm as well. I managed to watch youtube videos straight from the TV as well as browse online music libraries, though it was a tad sluggish (High Speed Cable).Plugging in a USB drive with some short films on it worked as well. The TV will recognize the USB device and then you can go ahead and access what you wish to watch or listen to from it. There is no demo built into the tv for video, but there is one music track and a few pictures automatically installed on the TV.No dead pixels. Lighting is even across the entire screen. Great black levels. Semi-Glossy screen (the mix between a glossy and matte). Color a bit faded, low bright levels. Certain colors seem washed out, and even at the most vivid settings, the color is a bit lack luster. This may have to do with the back lighting being minimal.The EX720 may not be the best HDTV Sony has to offer for 2011, but for its features and capability... I would say its a competitor for sure.Note: The North American EX720 was assembled in Mexico and the current LCD panels are the same Samsung uses. This may or may not be a problem for some TV buyers.HDTV is NOT 240hz as advertised, but 120hz. In 3D, you will only get a 60hz experience (120hz divided by 2, 60hz per eye for stereoscopic).", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "jaunticed eye John", "ReviewID": "R35AULF3KN25H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a 32 inch TV to fit in a cabinet I had made for the living room.  Most TVs in this size are pretty basic and was looking for something a little more high tech.  This model of Sony fit the bill perfectly.  The styling of the TV is really nice with a glossy black bezel all around and without the funny grey band on the bottom of the lesser 32s Sony sells.  The screen is more of a matte look and is great in eliminating glare from nearby windows.  I purchased the set primarily for the Internet streaming and so far this works great.  I was disappointed that I had to buy the wifi adapter for wireless streaming but it works really well.  If your lucky to have your internet close to the TV you can plug the ethernet cord directly to the TV.  I have kind of a lousy internet provider but it didn't seem to effect the streaming to the TV.  The TV found my home network quickly and connected easily. There was a software update and it did this quickly also.  There are a number of internet sites that come up on the menu including Netfix, Hulu, You Tube ,Crackle, Amazon instant movies, Qriosity (Sony library) etc.  Qriosity has hundreds of movies available including 3D movies.  They are not free however and charge anywhere from $3-$6  depending on if you want Standard Def, High Def or 3D.  You can watch the previews for free, however,  which I did for several hours.  The need for a blue ray player is questionable as there is so much content available through these internet sites.  The remote has no keyboard so a lot of scrolling around for is required for doing searches on You Tube, kind of a pain.  I have not tried the 3D feature yet so cannot comment on this.  The picture is beautiful out of the box and required very little adjustment by me to make it perfect.  The speakers, like most LED TVs are really bad and a sound bar or external speakers are a must.  The TV satisfied most of the requirements I had and at a price that was quite reasonable.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME", "Author": "d \"Movies, books,gaming - its how you can ste...", "ReviewID": "R2500KQ1W4ATQY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok - Three months of digging and I wanted to find a post that had EVERYTHING I was looking for before and after I got a TV - so I grouped all that I found and am posting it - hope its helpful.\"Motion flow 240 technology\" isn't the same as the refresh rate!!  This tv is 160 MHz - which is perfectly fine.  Don't be fooled otherwise!  I like to keep as much money in my pocket as I can.. I assume the same for others.I poured over every review, article, MFG site and top ten list for about 3 months before I picked this TV.  My focus was Samsung, LG, Vizio, Sony.  All of them said roughly the same things:1. 160mhz and 240mhz have very subtle, undetectable differences when viewing.. The big difference is the higher number and cost. - Marketing ploy.2. 3 D is great to have.. Maybe not right now but later on, maybe. The glasses aren't great to wear, \"bulky\", \"cause headaches\"(not sure on that one).. HOWEVER, I would rather have it as an option when spending this kind of money then not~my thought.3. Internet TV is a MUST HAVE (wifi OR wifi ready) -its where most everything is going now.4. Blue Ray player w/Internet applications and built in wifi - MUST HAVECost was a BIG factor - so based on that here is what I foundVizio - $Sony - $LG - $$Samsung - $$$Features was a BIG factor as well.  To get all I wanted within a reasonable price - Vizio and Sony were top.  The thing that I liked was Sony offered: 3D, was compatible with my Sony Blue ray (not a huge deal), only one with PiP, had won the C-net award and had the best reviews out of all of them... so it was Sony.Now - what I have found on this TV.~ It has a PiP option but it needs a PC for this/ I haven't tested this theory fully but I could not get the small picture to view anything, so I believe this is accurate... This isnt a deal breaker for me, I have a small computer I can use if I wanted but don't really care about it atm... it was an option I wanted in the future.~ The picture isnt great straight out of the box.. You HAVE to calibrate it.. Not hard, just sounds like it.  Im not at the TV - its from memory Options>Picture>Warm2, color 53, picture 54, backlight 2, brightness 52, sharpness 0 or 18 (any greater looks bad), hue 0...  Advanced settings>gamma +1 ,0,0, +2,+2, 0 ?  I know gamma is +1 and there is nothing else +1.. The rest are either 0 or +2 (no more) but see which you like more. Make sure under settings - eco - everything is off. The scene select is general.. And if there is something I forgot - let me know, I will look.~ this tv is wifi ready - its NOT built in.. Built in is nice BUT if you have a wifif built in blue ray player, then getting it on your TV is a waste of money.  In fact, I would go as far as to say that it would be CHEAPER to get a wifi built in Blue ray at a cost of 170ish then to pay an extra 300 or more for that function on your TV.  Most of the applications that I have seen are the same..or if they are MFG specific, they offer the same functions as those that are out there and aren't MFG specific.. Again, saying \"We have Hulu, Vudo, Pandora, blah blah\" is marketing because they ALL have something of that nature... regardless if its through your TV or the Blue ray.PS - the TV adapter (if you want internet through your tv as opposed to through the blue ray) is $80 which is much less then the $300 extra to have it on the TV.  Although, get an adapter with good signal reception.~ DO NOT expect a great picture on regular cable channels.. Get HD (a receiver from your cable company) - they are normally an extra $5ish per month.~ Gaming on this TV is awesome... I swear on some of the REGULAR movies you can see the actor's nose hairs, its THAT clear... cant wait to see Blue ray movies. Internet is cool! Not fun to navigate though but I can FB in 55\" now ..(not that I need it).~ Price check this TV!!!  I found mine on HSN (shocking!) For 1,999.00 - **in 2 installment payments!**.. Even with the shipping - its cheaper. Add the warranty and it's the same price as most other sites without tax, shipping, and warranty.  Plus they stand behind the product, amazing customer service and are 24/7. Seriously love HSN now.  I LOVE amazon.. But HSN has awesome cust service!!Learned a lot - still learning - wanted to make it easier for someone looking.

Canfield", "ReviewID": "R3FBGR1EGJR3FK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "To put it simply - the 3D in this TV does not work with the current firmware version.  The top 1/3 of the TV is completely blurry in 3D mode regardless of the source.After 10 calls, two months of waiting for them to send me nonsense like flash drives with ancient firmware that didn't work, polarizer lenses that didn't fit my glasses, a replacement TV, a visit from their repairman (who told me he would never buy a Sony TV), and finally just refusing to hang up until I got my call escalated, I *finally* spoke to a Sony engineer tonight. He got out a matching model and I talked him through reproducing the problem with this model and the online demo videos.  It was almost amusing to hear him saying, \"oh, that looks terrible!  Oh, and this video is even worse!\"He promised he would take it to the software department, and then even called me back about 30 minutes later to let me know he'd taken the problem to the software engineers and they would be working on the problem. I'm sure it will be many weeks before an update is released, and I simply can't forgive the HORRIBLE Sony service (every call to their call center will be full of static and echos), but I am at least hopeful that a resolution will come eventually.Other than the 3D, the TV is fine. The interface is a little clunky on some of the other features like bravia sync and the yahoo widgets, but it really shines if you hook up a PS3 and sony receiver.  You can power on all 3 devices and control the PS3 from one remote.  This is actually the reason I bought a Sony setup - I'm hiding my PS3 and receiver in a shelf behind the TV and wanted to be able to control the receiver from the TV.If I had to do it all again, I probably would not buy Sony equipment - how do you put out a 3D TV and not bother to test the 3D component?

I recommend going to this link [...] on the Sony website to see all of the reviews from unhappy customers such as myself. The 2D and DLNA features on this TV are great. Unfortunately, the main marketing point of this television is supposed to be that it is a 55 inch 3D experience from a reputable manufacturer. I have tried to watch Satellite 3D, Narnia, Avatar, Ice Age, and Rio on my TV in 3D. I tried using two different Sony 3D blu ray players as well as my PS3. No matter what setting I used the 3D is absolutely unwatchable. I have four pairs of the Sony 250 rechargable glasses and they all show the same picture. In a nutshell the crosstalk is horrendous. In most scenes the only clear image is the main character. The background is always blurry. It usually is better towards the bottom of the screen and progressively gets worse towards the top of the screen. In fast action sequences it cannot focus the picture at all. I have watched 3D Films in theaters and on other brands. This is absolutely the worst I have ever seen. After researching this issue on many websites, and speaking with an unresponsive Sony customer service (we will try to fix it on future models, thanks for the $$$) I will be taking this back for another manufacturer. If you only plan on watching 2D and using it`s web features it is a great buy.

The Vizio picture would freeze up and HDMI inputs were unstable until the set warmed up for about 6 minutes. Amazon did a great job of handling the return.My new Sony has a great picture and general features. The color was good with almost no adjustment, yielding good contrast, saturation and flesh tones. As mentioned by another reviewer, the picture was on the dark side as received. This was easily fixed by turning off the auto dimming feature. It would be nice if the auto dimming was adjustable because it currently stops down the backlight too much. Not too sure I like the onboard manual which has to be exited before going to the \"Home\" mode to adjust a feature. I found myself forgetting the adjustment sequence shown in the Manual by the time I got the proper Home feature displayed.  It would be better if the Manual and the Home modes could be displayed side by side on the screen and each (at least the \"Home\" mode) could be accessed.When I try to run a Playstation 2 game on this computer, such as Guitar Hero, the Playstation controller button pushes are out of sync with the screen feature being controlled, which renders it unplayable. I have searched the on board manual and not found any reference to synchronizing the game controller to the screen action. Pressing the \"Scene\" button on the TV controller gives a \"Game\" option, but apparently this only sets screen colors, etc and does not synchronize with the Playstation controller. Is this set incapable of working with a Playstation game?Despite the above criticisms, I love this TV for its great picture and general quality and performance.

Having Registration Code Troubles?", "Author": "ianoid \"ianoid\"", "ReviewID": "R1LTDJT6QWHWFJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great TV. See the other reviews, I'm pretty happy with it. 3D works great, although I still feel like it's a gimmick. I bought the 3D pack that included a 3D transmitter, 3D glasses and a movie. Do note that you don't need a 3D transmitter for this TV, it is built in, so you might as well buy the glasses separately unless there is a monetary advantage.This is my first Sony TV in a while (usually they just cost too much above the competition to bother). I am impressed at the design of everything, from the menus to the remote, to the very thin nice looking TV itself. Clearly this is Sony's core business.I did want to point out some things for those of you hoping to use online services like Amazon Video On Demand with this TV.Amazon has directions on how to setup services on the TV, which requires going to the Sony website and signing up for their online service (free) and entering a registration code that you have to get from your TV. This TV doesn't have cross media bar, and there is no \"Activate Enhanced Features\" option. So you may be wondering where to find your registration code. I called Sony service and they pointed out where it is- it is located in the Netflix section. Even if you need the registration code for other services like Amazon Video On Demand or Amazon Prime Instant Viewing or whatever, you need to look in this section to find your 4 digit registration code.Second, if you do want to use the internet with it, you need an Ethernet cable hook up, or you are forced to buy a proprietary Sony wireless adapter. WIRELESS INTERNET IS NOT BUILT INTO THE TV! I would suggest that if you don't have an Ethernet jack near your TV, try using a power line Ethernet adapter(plugged into the wall, not a power strip) instead of buying Sony's scamware. At least you can use the power line adapter for other stuff and it may even cost less. I just plug a router into the power line adapter and plug it into the TV and all my game consoles.

I felt it an important forum to post here on Amazon for those who are having issues with their Sony sets just so they know all of their available options. Amazon has the best pricing I have found to date if you are purchasing outright but if you are having problems with your existing Sony... READ ON![...]This is the best and most helpful website for Sony problems. My parents 60\" Grand WEGA television (same as mine) developed optical block issues after replacing the bulb. Blue dots, blobs and haze expanding over the screen. We just followed the advice on the site which includes links to Sony Listens and the facebook page previously mentioned by another reviewer. Sony will still honor the problems but you do have to be decisive with them. I was handling this for my elderly parents and told them up front what we wanted- a replacement not a repair. Sony Listens email generated a call within a few hours and, though I had to chase them a bit, that was the best primary contact point for me and they were very polite.  We have over 5 decades of customer loyalty in the family which to us mattered a whole lot.Sony offered several sets from some 2010 models at first. We looked at them in the store but my parents have vision issues (cataracts and macular degeneration) that necessitated a matte screen like their old set but the 2010 models were glossy. We asked for the 2011 model, which is this particular television being reviewed here, and they gave us prices for that. They cover shipping and my parents will pay a greatly reduced prorated amount for the television which we will order later today from Sony's customer service when they choose the size they want.Do not expect a completely free television replacement and don't expect that to be a fair request on your part since your own television has been of use to you; that is my honest opinion. Fairness is a 2-way street. Sony also credited the $149 cost of the new bulb that we purchased from Vann's who is an authorized Sony dealer with proof of purchase. If my parents had paid for repairs, that would have factored in as well. Full credit for 6 months or less and partial credit for 6 months to a year ago. That was very fair of Sony in my opinion.My husband is a professional licensed electrical engineer and he feels that where Sony erred was in not reengineering the problem with the optical block but that was a strategic business decision that they made which happened to not be a wise one. However, they are still working with people who contact them with the issues despite the extensions on the warranties won in the class action suits now being expired. We knew nothing about the warranty extensions for either of our matching sets but a little internet poking paid off with the site above. Thanks to site compiler Steve Linke for taking the time to put together such a helpful site. I only wish another family member had known about it before he gave away his defective Sony television which would have saved him a lot of money. But, we know better now. I hope this helps others as much as it did my parents.Sony has completely reengineered these new sets and the technology is quite different. I feel confident in getting a Sony once again because they took responsibility for their errors- something that many companies will simply not do in this disposable age. If my own set goes out, I will follow the same steps as my parent's and ask Sony for assistance. I feel confident that I will get somewhere with them.This particular set here has a great picture and I highly recommend that you take a trip to the store and see it in person. It is very thin and offers 3D capability. The glasses have come down to about $50 a pair and we were told by a sales rep that the price drops almost daily on those. This set is internet ready and loaded with features. I am writing this on my 27\" IMac with the same screen technology and it is super! Thin, bright and clear. The Sony also offers a new feature that prevents blurring on high speed picture motion which is really nice whether you are watching sports or a cheetah racing after prey on the Discovery channel.Good luck in your search for a set ad educate yourself- your will be glad you did.UPDATE: I reposted the url and Google description below for those who need to find the page. I do not know if Amazon removed it- that is very strange. It is now 8-12-11 and here is the rest of the story. I continued to advocate for my parents and got Sony to agree to offer a current 2011 year model and in 60\" which is the size they lost. They chose this very television being reviewed here and Sony shipped it to them for about $1,300 including a no tax/no shipping agreement. This was still a chunk of money but as I stated above, we felt it fair that the old television was pro-rated against the new one since they had used it for several years without a problem. They are very happy with the new set and it came via a trucking company in about 2 weeks after the order was placed. The picture and features are super and we were so glad that we insisted on the 2011's matte screen over the 2010 glossy. All in all they are happy with the outcome.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not too bad...really!", "Author": "A.

I bought a used 40'' described as being in \"good\" condition--couple of scuffs on the top of the TV, but not a scratch on the screen.BackgroundI was wanting to buy a monitor to use with my MBP.  So I started looking around and was favoring the new 27'' apple thunderbolt...But then I thought, for a couple hundred less I could just get a 40'' Sony Bravia 3D TV.  At 240hz I can easily play video games or watch movies using mini port, no problem--(I have a lot of high-res pics that I took while traveling and I can flip through the photos full screen pretty much instantly).  Sorry Apple, maybe next time.Well, there's no point in having a 3D TV without 3D glasses...so I bought the Blueray Harry Potter 3D glasses bundle (see review on that product).  The 3d on this TV, using the active glasses, is amazing!  Originally, I thought of the 3D as nothing more than a nice add-on to this well-priced set...However, having watched both of the latest Harry Potter's in Blueray 3D, I can easily say that the 3D is no joke--it's probably this TV's BEST feature!  I must admit there are some crossfade issues from time to time...but let's just say there's no way I'm watching the Super Bowl or the Summer Olympics in 2D.  Further, with the Simulated 3D feature on this TV, you don't even need 3D content to view 3D--as long as you have the glasses of course--everything from your favorite childhood shows; family photos; and home videos; to the iTunes visualizer (!!) is just waiting to be viewed by you and your friends in 3D.  Though I have praised the 3D capabilities of this TV, I must add that the active 3D glasses tech is not the same 3D most of us are used to seeing at the movie theater.  While it is crystal clear and very cool looking 95% of the time, it's just not the same tech commonly known.  The main difference, to me, is that with traditional theater-3D, at certain high-action points things seem to pop \"out\" at you (i.e. Jurassic Park where the dino takes a bite at the screen).  Whereas, with active 3D, things don't really pop out at you...you kind of pop \"in.\"  It might be easier to think of it as looking at 3D objects through a 2D window (like riding in a car)...definitely cool depth and illusion--but don't expect this TV to turn you into Tony Stark with holographic images popping up all over the room.ProsUltra SlimGood price-valueRemote can control TV and PS3--both are Sony.Active 3D is a game-changerConsNot very easy to adjust the vertical viewing angle--it changes angle horizontally easily though.Wifi should be built in!  None of this spend 'another' 100 stuff...Internet TV + apps sounds great and all, but I just use my PS3 for Netflix and hook it up to my MBP for internet--way faster than the TV's capabilities, I'm sure.Like most monitors, it gets dusty quickly--more of a general gripe--but seriously, a dust-particle-repelling-ionizing-thing-a-ma-jig would be some nice future tech ;-)", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV but could use improvements", "Author": "Teresa", "ReviewID": "R3OCUX5QICVW61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I watched the price on this TV for several months.

When I first hooked up this TV right next to my Sony LCD TV, it looked very dim and washed out and I was not happy.  When we took it upstairs to put in master bedroom and hooked it up, the picture looks much better, maybe due to lighting since it is less bright in our bedroom.

You can't call the toll free number on the weekend, only the long distance line but since I have IP phone service, this is free for me anyways.  Connecting to Netflix was very easy.  The things I don't like about this TV is that it takes too many clicks to do anything.  For example, to put a sleep timer on I would have to do a minimum 5-7 clicks to get to that setup and to get out, I have to do at least 3 more clicks to get out.  The remote is kinda weird when you try to put in the batteries, not easy.  This TV does not have built in Wi-Fi but I don't mind to connect the ethernet cable directly to an RJ45 port.

Suffice to say that, if you are looking for a 2D experience, this model is outstanding on so many levels.

I already had a great 2D Bravia (with a larger screen!) which I sold to buy this, such was my interest and excitement about gaming and blu-ray in 3D.What a horrible mistake. There is no way that this TV can be considered acceptable for 3D content. The 'cross-talk' (a problem by which everything in 3D appears to have a double or triple image, especially in areas of contrasting brightness or color) is so bad that 3D content becomes unwatchable. Even in the best case scenario, after hours of fine-tuning and tweaking, cross-talk is frustratingly and disappointingly evident at all times. The best I've managed is with Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition running through nVidia's 3DTV Play (via a Geforce 580).

Being somewhat mechanically inclined, I took the back off of the TV, noted the part number of the two power supply boards \"APS-299\" (the main power supply board) and \"DPS-78CH\" (the 3D power supply board).  I found a great E-bay vendor (hotpriceparts) who carried these two boards new and ordered them (at a cost of about $100).  They came 4 days later (they ship Priority Mail at no extra cost) and replaced the suspected defective boards (which took about 10 minutes).  Turned the TV on and the set worked just fine.I cannot believe that Sony has released a TV with such as fragile set of power supply boards.  To have a $2500 TV fail within two years is inexcusable.  Sony's U.S. service department gave me the runaround and wanted at least $1000 to fix the set.Stay away from Sony!

This is an awesome television for it's purpose. They did not promise the world of this tv. Here's the real deal dealing with your television:All 3D glasses for every television out excluding the brand new LG's are right around the $130-$150 range per glass. That is just an industry standard. There isn't a way around it because all manufacturers, even mitsubishi, has glasses that are ranged at this exact price.Also, to the person who was talking about needing the dongle. Don't blame Sony for the Wireless Ready scheme. Every single manufacturer, whether it's Blu-Ray or TV, if it has the capability for the dongle it will say wireless ready. If it has it built in it will specifically say so.For all of you gamers, whether PC or console: The buffering speed doesn't make a difference to people who really know their electronics. When a professional installer calibrates a tv in the sub-system menus, normally that person will turn the buffer off for gamers. Reason being that the buffer may create somewhat smoother an image, but it creates latency (lag) in an image. The best thing for a TV to do is to accept whatever signal rating it is given. This will allow for nearly zero lag on the part of the TV.Overall this television is an awesome idea to more wholly accommodate the market with effective 3D technology.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not impressed", "Author": "Stephan", "ReviewID": "R2WPGW3FXUNDK0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall, I'm disappointed. The image quality is good, but also a little bit dull. Although I could have lived with the image quality, I found sound quality simply unbearable. I would not recommend buying the TV, unless you hook it up to a stereo via optical cable when watching movies (which I don't have, because I still like my 20+ year old stereo). The TV does not have regular analog audio out, only headphones out, which, however, will keep the regular sound on the TV always muted. I found this to be a major design flaw of this TV, because I don't want to turn on the Stereo every time I watch the news, and at the same time, I also don't want to manually plug in the stereo when watching a movie.Finally, even with \"Motionflow\" turned off entirely, I still noticed some smoothing when watching Blu-Ray movies, which was not acceptable for me as I don't enjoy watching movies with even the slightest \"soap opera effect\". Others may find this not to be an issue though.The internet features, however, are very nice: all major online services, such as Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus, are supported.I bought the TV last week, and returned it this weekend. Instead, I went for a Samsung UN46D6420 (6400), which produces a much crisper image, has a sleeker design and much better sound (and audio out).

I called Sony directly and (after asking if I wanted to sign up for promotional e-mils) offered me the choice of a similar refurbished TV for $549 (on top of the $50 repair center bill already incurred) or a 15% discount on a new set.  My opinion is that 27 months is not a reasonable life expectancy for a new $1000+ TV nor is being expected to pay $600 to rectify the situation.  Sony used to be a premium brand, one would have hoped that they would take more accountability for the performance of their products.Have since replaced the TV with a new model from Samsung.

It has an extremely good picture with a 120Hz refresh rate (comparable to very high end televisions), and it's the least shiny screen you can find on 2011 TV's (still semi-gloss unfortunately, but at least the front isn't covered with glass).  The bezel is also semi-gloss black; shiny, but not nearly so shiny as the bezel on the Samsung and higher-end Sony models.  If you plug in a Sony A/V receiver with HDMI, you can control the receiver through an on-screen GUI, and get a volume bar when you change the receiver's volume (great for hidden installations).The reason this TV was such a good deal is that there have been problems with the 3D functionality for months now - I checked the reviews on many sites, and lots of other people complained that their 3D wasn't working well on this TV.

The sound is also good -- from the description, I wasn't even sure if it had speakers, but it does. This is our first HDTV, so I can't compare it to others, but I can compare it to the 25\" CRT TV it replaced, and the sharpness is stunning. Be sure to get proper HDMI cables. For the first five days or so we had the TV connected to our cable company's box with their coaxial cable, and the picture even then was greatly enhanced over what our old TV produced. But after we swapped that for an HDMI cable, the picture quality improved by yet another magnitude. Some have commented on the screen's small size (32\" diagonal). We have a small house with a small living room, and we sit only about seven or eight feet from the screen. The size is perfect for us. Additionally, we were able to continue using our entertainment center because the screen is only about 29 3/4\" wide and 21 3/4\" tall (without the stand, it's about 18 1/2\" tall).The only thing I'd ask to be different so far is the addition of a single button on the remote to adjust screen size. True HD programs are best viewed in \"full\" screen mode; but some programs, like those on BBC America, may be in wide screen format, but they are not being transmitted in true HD, so they have to be watched in \"zoom\" mode to fill the screen. Yet others, especially old movies like those on TCM, or older TV shows, are best viewed in \"normal\" mode so the top and bottom of the image aren't cropped off (I would have designated this mode \"classic\" or something similar, since \"full\" is clearly the new normal). As things are, it's not difficult to change the screen mode, but several additional button presses are required to get to point were changes can be made.Overall, a great TV, though.UPDATE May 27, 2011I found the button I was looking for on the remote. It's marked \"Wide,\" and it does exactly what I wanted it to do. The only reason I didn't remove the second paragraph from yesterday's review is because I think \"Wide\" is a poor choice of label. It should have been labeled \"Aspect\" or \"Width.\" It's also not as well positioned on the remote as it could have been.

Wireless is NOT BUILT IN which is important if you have to use the wired line in and there is not one installed behind your tv.  We went to radio shack and bought a wireless usb.  However, these seem to require you to load software into a computer and duh the tv does not have that.  so I'm thinking it would have to be a specific sony wireless usb and that was not clear in the description or reviews.  Next, it does NOT accept webcams except for sony's which is pretty pricy.  We tried and the tv does not recognize it. If these features are important you might want to add up the price of going to a model with built in wireless and/or built in camera.  There are very few inputs that fit existing electronics.  that is, most of them are hdmi and none of our existing dvd players, computer, etc. have that.  so you have to pull the red/yellow/white inputs in and out if you have several players than need to go in your tv.  Overtime I'm guessing newer items will have this and it won't feel so limiting.  it does have usb and an analog computer input (does not come with cords).  We plugged our laptop and walah it was perfect on the screen.  However, we would have preferred to do that directly on the screen. If you are new to this, an internet tv does not have a regular internet browser where you can just go to sites.  It just means that they have deals with some providers and can stream their content - netflix, pandora, amazon, youtube, facebook, skype.  even then, searching and typing is a little clunky.  so if you want to bring up pbskids.com you cannot do that.  most of the delivered internet programs were pretty easy to sign on to- you go to a website on your own computer and enter a code on the computer.  pandora seems to be the hardest-- it goes through the sony site and wants a registration code that no matter how you follow the sony instructions, doesn't appear to be where they say it is.  the internet programs the bravia provides do not allow for closed captioning.  if you plug your wii into the same tv, it works.  i contacted sony and \"thier internet functions do not support cc.

Then again on cue, the left side of my screen showed 3 vertical lines, one black, one grey, and one white.

But, if you have external srt subtitles files, then it refuses to use them, just like the PS3.I would love to comment on the 3D aspect of the TV, but, frankly, the cost of the 3D glasses is ridiculously high, the number of 3D movies is ridiculously low, so I'm not going to waste my money.Oh, and first impressions were a disaster.

Wow ! I did not know there were that many blades of grass on the field, the sportscaster really needs to trim his nose hair. HDTV is more than can be imagined because you do not know what you have missed. The movement and clarity made for initial motion dizziness due to the increased amount of information I needed to visually process. Have not tried the 3D feature yet, $55 per set of active 3D glasses will have to wait until the economy improves and a BluRay player can be obtained. Thinking about it from an economic viewpoint, spending over $220 for 4 active 3D glasses so the family can all sit and watch in 3D, seems a little exorbitant. There is not enough programming to justify the expense. The main reason for getting 3D capable is for the 240 hz refresh rate which is really nice for sports and action scenes.Retrospectively, I probably would not buy the Sony wireless dongle if I had it to do over. The internet connection goes through the Sony website where I can review and purchase more Sony product but little else.

This Sony Bravia's picture is amazing and you can absolutely see the difference with the naked eye.The best feature of this Sony Smart TV is the quality of the Video from the \"Smart Apps\".  I have been using for the past year my Playstation 3 as my gateway to  HULU and NetFlix and YouTube.  My current Internet DSL is 1.5 download I was concerned about getting a Smart TV because there were days that I could not watch any of these Internet Apps on my Toshiba/Playstation 3 combination because of the constant pausing and buffering.On my third day of having my Sony Smart TV, yes we purchased after Christmas ;) I have to write a review to share how thrilled I am with the quality of the TV and what I suspect is a higher quality connection to HULU plus, Netflix, YouTube, and now Amazon Instant Video. There is a test that I assume the Sony Bravia does that the Playstation 3 never did, it's a connection test for speed and throughput.  I never saw this test on Playstation 3 but I see it every time on the Sony Bravia.I am typing this while my five year old son is watching Cars 2 HD via Amazon Instant Video.  No need to bother with upgrading our internet connection since everything we have watched on hulu, Netflix, amazon is been in High Def and not one single pause in mid show and has been higher quality then before.  This Bravia Internet does make a difference compared to my old Playstation 3 that was riddled with buffering pauses for lower quality transmission.Ohhhh and by the way Call of Duty MW3 on Playstation 3 on this TV is a complete mind blower on this Bravia versus my old Toshiba smaller and less spec HD TV system.

The two guys who delivered it put it in the living room and started their acceptance procedure by removing four plastic clips and sliding the the top of box off its shipping base to expose a 55-inch Sony encased in blocks of Styrofoam. I plugged it in, attached the satellite antenna cable and it worked like a charm. Am I keeping the box awhile? Oh Yeah! Lets sit back and see if this puppy is going to keep functioning for the next month or so.For some buyers... here's the interesting part. My current set-up includes an Off the Air (OTA) antenna in order for me to get \"all\" the local channels.  This Sony uses one RF coax jack for Satellite IN, Off Air IN and for Cable IN.  Apparently the Sony KDX55EX720 design guy has some devilish scheme to toggle between the incoming sat signal and the incoming OTA signal. And.. here's where the 4-star rating comes in to play. The Users Guide and the iManual stored in the TV memory was not written by anyone named Hemingway.  So during the very EZ initial set-up process you can get blind-sided regarding a feature called - Rovi On Screen Guide.The Set-Up Guide says \"If you receive channels from a cable box or satellite and do not wish to use the TVs built in tuner, select SKIP. Selecting SKIP will disable the Rovi On Screen Guide feature\". So I did this SKIP thing and while the satellite signal works fine there is no way to toggle back and forth between the Satellite antenna and the OTA antenna.  I guess the writer figured people would only use one of the inputs, Sat, OTA or Cable. And guess what. There is zip in the Guide or iManual about how to undo SKIP to reenable the Rovi On Screen Guide feature. I figure there has to be a trick to using the \"INPUT\" button on the remote but right (in my first few days)  I don't see anything in the iManual that would provide even the smallest of clues about \"Undo SKIP\".

So wondered If i should get a different brand TV i.e. from Samsung. After researching a lot I settled down to this one. Which offered a great color and brightness for the price.After having the first TV, I realized that Bravia Sync feature is quite important to me for controlling the PS3 with the TV remote. This way I don't have to worry about the extra remote in the house.One thing I realized while shopping for TV is that, the stores keep cheap TV and 2.5k+ TV on the shelf, If you compare this TV with 2.5k Samsung TV, this one is surely going to loose in terms of clarity and color depth and once you get your own TV, it always looks good for you, unless a guy who owns a 2.5k TV comes to your home.Anyway that is just my perspective,The TV is nice, looks good in my living room and the color depth is better than kdl46ex620 model. The 3D and the internet aspect did not entice me, because those feature are not often used, but you want a \"best\" looking picture for you to enjoy.Speakers are not that great, but OK. I have Bose speakers so it is not a fair comparison. People without external speakers can still enjoy it.The Channel change speed is good and better than my previous Sony TV.

As others have noted, the screen has a 120hz refresh rate, not 240hz, though there are still reviews of this TV on the Internet that say it's 240hz.The first thing I did was connect my Ethernet cable (the TV found its settings quickly and easily from my router) and updated the firmware from the built-in TV software. That was easy.I like the TV's general styling and build - the specs say the panel is 1.66\" thick but I measure no more than 1.25\". I assume they are measuring the small protrusion near the base of the panel. The TV has only a 1\" bezel (2\" at the bottom) and the base swivels nicely 20 degrees. The screen will also tilt 6 degrees.The remote is easy to use and the streaming content selection is decent. The user interface is straightforward to navigate.Many of the built-in internet apps are Yahoo Widgets which is a bit ironic since Sony also sells a \"Google TV\". The Yahoo Widgets are clumsy to use (the Flickr widget still won't let me login to my Flickr account yet displays no error msg) and they only display on one side of the TV instead of using the entire screen. The web browser is a bit slow, and I noticed it does not display Flash content but did okay with some complex Javascript. I have to say that Sony has made the web browsing experience about as good as one could expect using a standard remote (but don't expect much -- it's pretty slow). I haven't tried the Skype app yet because it requires that special Sony camera/mic device.I did notice one issue when I hooked up a PC to the TV. I mainly use this TV with a Mac Mini (though this problem may show up with other 1080p-capable Apple Macintoshes and Windows PCs). When you first view the Mac Mini on the TV, you may find that about 1/2\" of the PC display is cut off on all sides, or, you may notice that the entire PC display appears with a 1-2\" black border around it. To remedy either of these conditions, you need to go to the TV's settings: \"Settings -> Picture & Display -> Screen\" and set them to something like this:Wide Mode = FullAuto Wide = On4:3 default = OffAuto Display Area = OffDisplay Area = Full PixelThe only setting here that I know is required is \"Display Area = Full Pixel\". The \"Full Pixel\" option doesn't appear *unless* the PC signal is being applied on the selected port.Then the PC display fits perfectly on the screen.One of the nice things about this TV is that it has a lot of picture settings so it's possible to really fine-tune the display to make movies look better, or the fonts on your PC display, or whatever you happen to be watching.All in all, it's quite a nice unit for the money.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV except for 3D", "Author": "D. Vogel", "ReviewID": "R10EBPX9EA9EIH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV along with a 3D starter package from Amazon a few weeks ago.  The TV arrived about a day after it was shipped--within a couple of days of ordering--and was in perfect condition.  Set up is very easy.  I have it connected to Apple TV (which is new and I love it!), an HD cable box and Sony PS3 (my 3D source), all of which connected very easily.  At some point I was misled (by myself or reading some other review) into believing that I needed a separate 3D sync transmitter in order to use the 3D features.  This is NOT needed as the sync transmitter is built into the lower corner of the TV.  (Oh well, the transmitter was the cheapest part of the bundle, the cost of which was made up for in the bundle compared to the cost of buying separates, so I probably won't bother returning it.)Initially I had cableTV connected using a standard cable line rather than HDMI.  An HDMI cable (Audioquest \"Forest\") provided outstanding picture quality regardless of HD channel programming or not.The Apple TV is a favorite source for accessing my iTunes video library and works flawlessly as far as the TV is concerned.  The Sony set up menu is beautiful, easy and intuitive to use and very complete--\"Apple TV\" is easily added as an HDMI source on the menu of sources.My one complaint is the 3D viewing--overall it is quite amazing and fairly good, but there are sometimes problems with muddled, blurry or ghosted images typically in the far distant elements of some scenes.  This is not infrequent but also not consistent which makes it somewhat MORE distracting when it occurs.  The glasses(TDG-BR100) are also a bit large and heavy but tolerable.  Another complaint is that they do have a gap in the sides/bottom and can reflect any brightly lit objects BEHIND the wearer--also a distraction.I bought the TV because of other features rather than the 3D and I am overall very very satisfied.  I have a larger, bit older, Sony Bravia HDTV (54\") without 3D but with other similar features and with which I am very happy.  The two sets are both outstanding HDTV's.

But my opinion has changed drastically in the last few years due to a series of failures of their TV's, and now it will be a long time before I ever buy anything from Sony again. It appears that they had chosen to lower their engineering/manufacturing standards and were trying to make a killing using the momentum from their old reputation. I guess it's caught up with them since their electronics group posted a $1.1 Billion loss in the 4th quarter of 2011. It appears that the only thing keeping them alive is their (American) entertainment group (music, movies, etc.).My troubles with them started back in 2006 when I purchased their 60\" SXRD TV. It produced a beautiful picture until the \"light engine\" in it began to fail and had to be replaced. When we moved, I sold that TV and bought a 55\" SXRD that was a better fit for our new home. Again, beautiful picture, but the light engine in this one failed too! I had it replaced and when the replacement failed, I did my due diligence and found there was a class action suit against Sony for these TV's. Based on this suit, Sony replaced it with a 55\" LED/LCD model (KDL-55EX710) but had to pay $250 for the \"upgrade\" (and pay $75.00 to have the old one hauled off). This was in July of 2011, and 2 weeks ago (early March 2012) the upgrade failed. I have been without a TV since and have been told that my warranty does not cover replacement, only repair. The problem is, they have no parts to fix it. Now, maybe the parts problem is a result of the tsunami, which I can understand and I have great empathy for the folks in Japan.

The Picture is too dark. No matter how I adjusted the picture settings, I just could not get an acceptable quality. It was just too dark.2. The Picture from PC graphic card DVI to HDMI was clipped on both sides. So it could not show then whole 1080p picture. I had to use VGA input, which was bad (had noise within the picture).I almost returned the TV. But decided to give it another try,1. Settings => Preference => Ambient Light sensor , this is the setting that makes the picture go darker. Apparently, this is a known issue with SONY TV. (Bad firmware programming). Turn this off, the picture will become brighter and acceptable.2. Out of desperation, I connected the TV to internet and tried to upgrade the firmware. It doesn't have an option for firmware. So I just upgraded \"software\". Then the problem of clipping for DVI input went away like magic. (I was told the \"program update\" would fix the 1st problem too)So I highly recommend whoever buy this TV upgrade their software via internet immediately.Other reviews covered other aspects of the TV pretty well. I won't go over them here.Picture is ok. On par to other named brand TVs.Viewing angle is not so good. Another known problem for SONY TVs.And lastly,  \"wireless ready\" = no wireless. Not that I need this feature, but label it as \"wireless ready\" and yet you need another USB device to access wireless is just not right. That's like saying my PC box is display ready except you have to purchase another monitor to plug it in.All in all, the only reason this TV prevails is because there isn't any other good TVs in this 30 - 32 inch size range for LED 240hz.EDIT: ok. the TV is not really 240hz. it is 120hz as many has pointed out. So motion flow XR240 doesn't mean jack. It is still 120hz refresh rate. Not that 240hz feature matters, but labelling it as 240hz and trying to confuse the customers just seems shady to me.

Besides having an awesome picture with very good sounding speakers (which you can't say for most 32 inch HDTV's) I constantly use the pivot and sometimes the tilt, as well as the headphone jack, which allows me to hook up my external self powered speakers whenever I want to. No need to hook up my power hungry amplifier just to get much bigger and fatter sound, which is seldom necessary. Also has a built in presence sensor with automatically turns off the picture (but not the sound) when I am out of the room for more than 5 minutes.

I bought it used since Amazon is pretty good about used products and my TV came practically new! Not even a fingerprint on it and all the sealed packaging for the remote, batteries, and manual! The 3D on it is amazing, the only time I ever see slight double effects,and I mean slight, is when I watch videos in (side-by-side) but when you do full frame 1080p 3D (which is what comes on PS3, XBox, and 3D Blurays) then it's gorgeous! It's a very bright TV with very smart energy saving features to turn off your TV if no one is in the room. Comes installed with Netflix which plays your content up into 1080p depending on your internet connect. There is a downside of the TV not having Wifi, but I just had a repeating router laying around and used that instead with an Ethernet cable. I knew when I bought it that it didn't have wifi, I just wished it did. :) If you're aiming for surround sound with this TV, don't be like some reviewers and complain that it doesn't work with ancient RCA technology, as I haven't touched a RCA cable in 6 years now. You can buy home theater packages for way under 300. I recommend getting one to complete this TV. It will be the most total immersive experience you have ever had. I am a very happy customer with my TV and Amazon considering I bought this used. Just, if you buy it on here, be prepared to wait a month.

We thought we would have to cough up $1100+, but last year's (2011) model came on sale at Sears, and was the floor model, so we paid around $860?  Yay, Sears!  We also got a couple of kids-sized 3D glasses on clearance when we got the TV.  Sony TDG-BR50/P Youth Size 3D Active Glasses, Pink They were only $15 each pair!  Now to find adult sized ones...My one complaint...speakers not so great...very little depth to them, and sometimes the cinema sound is overwhelming with background sounds, yet dialog is low?  But still way better than our old TV!  This new TV didn't \"talk\" to our old surround sound system from Walmart.  But with the money we saved, we waited for the matching Sony BDV-HZ970W Blu-ray Home Theater System to come down...and lucked out and got the floor model too! I think the husband paid around $450? I am still playing with it, and expect the cinema effect to balance out, but can't wait to have the twin nephews over to watch Cars in 3D!  Gotta buy it first...Other complaint...cant make use of Skype...no camera!  but we can connect the net-book or an ipad to the TV, and see the Skype on the TV that way.  Some of the iPad apps don't play thru the TV, though. We haven't made use of all that yet...still excited to get our prime time shows like Grimm in HD!  Can't wait for Smash and Glee with the new speakers!!!!The TV is awesome, and can do so much!  We had a 25 year old RCA, a huge, heavy cube!  This new TV blows it away.  It looks great from across the room...about 15-20 feet away, but it is kinda blurry if you sit closer than a few feet.  We still can't afford digital cable, but the analog that we pay for comes with some digital broadcast channels, and we are stoked!  We loved watching the Olympics on it, and are looking forward to the new TV season.  Also, I got the free trial to Amazon Prime instant videos, and get to see \"Lost\" in HD! I can pause it to take breaks, and watch without commercials to distract me!  We never used to get that channel in clear, so never really got into it.

My review is based on how well Sony met that quality.Features (4.9/5.0):Sony gadgets intrigue me.  The apps buit into this TV are great!  I love watching Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant Video without turning on my PS3.  However, I do hold it to the PS3's streaming competitors such as the Roku and WDTV.  Why can't there be an option to stream my mkv files?  If I need to pay a couple bucks (as if I haven't paid enough for the TV already) for the codec, then please give me the option.Picture Quality (5.0/5.0):Admittedly, I am not an expert at judging picture quality.  This TV looks amazing to me.  I have TV's from other companies such as Sharp and RCA which are nice, but I always tend to prefer how Sony TV's look.Reliability/Customer Service (3.0/5.0):I purchased this TV about a year ago, after my Samsung TV died with only 3 years of service.  I didn't want to buy a new TV because I was closing on a new house, but I knew that closing could take awhile and my family would drive me nuts if we had 2 months of summer break without watching TV (Feel free to judge).  About 6 weeks after I purchased this TV, it died.  I called for a replacement and they suggested replacing it with a refurbished model.  That suggestion made me irate, after all I just purchased it weeks ago; I could have purchased a refurbished model for significantly less.  The customer service representative's response seems to have been scripted; she then recommend a repair.  I agreed.  However, the part kept getting delayed.  I called 5 times to get the TV repaired but the part was still MIA.  They finally agreed to replace the TV.  I had to go through some hoops to get this accomplished (which were quite annoying), but once I complied, it was supposedly on its way.  Perhaps I am just spoiled by Amazon's speedy deliver, but delivery took way too long.  It was delivered about 5 weeks after the original TV died and about 2 week before I moved.  I'm sure that the TV could have been delivered faster.  I have had the new TV for almost a year.  There have been no problems.Summary (4.0/5.0):Great TV!

I could not be happier! I read so many reviews and looked at so many TV's my head was spinning.  When I finally got to see this specific TV I found the picture quality very good, build and appearance good and functions good.  People had commented about bad sound but I find that not true.  The sound system has a ton of options to customize it and you can hone it right in.  Yea it is still limited somewhat but is the best of any TV that size I looked at.  Same with the pictue, many ways to customize it to your liking.  About the only thing I noticed that is different with this TV is the picture is slightly darker than I normally expect to see.  It is due to the matt screen finish.  This hides finger prints and glair very well but also darkens the screen image.  I forget about it once watching for a few minutes though.  The screen sensor is great about changing the brightness level as the room light changes.  Power saving mode works good and is nice.  One thing I do not like is the built in WIFI is not really very helpful unless you spend the extra $$ for the Sony adapter.  Just get a DVD player with WIFI in it and move on. I see no blur at all and sports look great.  Overall I am quite pleased but remember I did not pay the normal going $900.00 price.

Watkins \"The Film Outpost\"", "ReviewID": "RGCLTAV3VYNTZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It took much longer than expected to purchase this HD television because of the elevated expense. In anticipation, I diligently explored and reviewed other brands such as the LG 42LV4400 and Hitachi L42S504, however settling on the Sony BRAVIA KDL40EX720 for overall features, quality and savings. I wanted an HD TV with amenities including a 120hz refresh rate, LED backlighting, internet alternatives, Wi-Fi ready, integrated 3D, and fantastic picture quality.Now, where to buy? I've bought numerous items both new and used with ease and success from Amazon, saving much in the process, so this was the chosen avenue. With a budget of $700, I found it difficult to find a brand new 40 inch set, so I selected one from Warehouse Deals, Inc. that was fulfilled by Amazon.Initially, on January 12, 2012, I placed a KDL40EX720 in my cart, \"Used - Like New\" with a price of $799, leaving it there until deciding whether or not to spend $100 over my budget. After two weeks...yes two (I'm very patient when making any substantial purchase) the price surprisingly dropped to $673, including free shipping and tax. Needless to say, on January 26, I pulled the trigger and made the purchase, albeit with a savings of $126.The television arrived in six days on February 1, 2012 just as promised and in pristine condition. There were no marks, dings or scratches anywhere on the exterior surface and all auxiliary items such as the remote and Wi-Fi adapter were in unopened plastic packages. Except for the somewhat worn carton, it had the appearance of a brand new product.With my brother's assistance in the set up, now ready for the acid test; it didn't fire up. We recycled the power several times and with the remote attempted boot-up without any success. Using the manual power switch didn't work either. This turn of events was not only unanticipated, but also extremely disheartening.I bought the Sony set without the privilege of an extended service plan or \"SquareTrade\" warranty hoping that it would never be a future factor. Because of the fact that it was purchased \"Used-Like New,\" the only available warranty was SquareTrade; the horror stories read concerning this pushed me into another direction.Explaining the trouble upon calling a local TV repair shop, the proprietor chose to make a house call and check it out. Fundamentally, he did everything that we did in efforts to power it on without resolution. Finally, he checked the remote to see if it was working properly, which it was, and then recommended that I return it and get a refund. What the hell, he didn't charge me for the visit, because he didn't wish to open it up and investigate any further. I accepted his recommendation and decided to return the set to Warehouse Deals, Inc., scurrying to attain all the proper paper work from Amazon. The return was in the works.After a restless night of sleep with reluctance to settle for return (the ridiculously great $673 deal), on Saturday, 2/4, I woke up inspired to power the TV on. Enlisting my brother once again, he being an all-around handyman, I decided to remove the back panel (I'm not recommending this), check the switch and all cable connections. The switch appeared fine, though, I was actually looking for a reset button to engage. All connections were intact except for one; the cable leading to the picture module was SUSPICIOUSLY disconnected. We immediately plugged it in and proceeded to reattach the back panel. Using the remote, to our astonishment, the TV POWERED ON!!!Today, April 6, 2012, I'm so glad to mention that outside of the above-aforementioned horror story, the Sony BRAVIA KDL40EX720 is an exceptional LED HDTV for any consumer to purchase. The colors and contrast with high def relegates my donated Toshiba CRT to oblivion. It will serve anyone exceedingly well to exercise patience in purchasing such revolutionary components. Looking back, the only thing I'd reconsider is to spend the extra cash for a new one (DON'T DO IT!!!).", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great LED TV!", "Author": "MoparsRus", "ReviewID": "RGYOO492B9W57", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Item arrived as expected.

A TON.The Sony KDL46EX720, to me, is a good option to buy in 2012 because it is last year's model and can be had for ~$500 cheaper than when it was introduced, and cheaper still than newly released models.  That being said, it doesn't lack for capabilities.  I've used it in 1080p, 1080i, 720p, and 480p; playing games in Xbox360 (1080p), watching TV on Verizon Fios (1080i), movies & YouTube on AppleTV (720p), and Wii (480p - up converted by my receiver to 720p).  Everything looks great so far, and because the EX720 has a matte finish screen, it works well in a somewhat -less than optimal- lighting situation, my place is quite bright during the day.The main differences between this one and the pricier options up the line weren't worth the added cost for MY situation.  My router is in my media cabinet so I don't need wifi.  My home is very bright so the glossy finish of Gorilla Glass wasn't appealing, and I wall mounted so the added weight of the glass was a mild negative.  There is some weird marketing that I couldn't figure out about the refresh rate of the set.  Is it 60Hz or 120Hz, is 240Hz better?  From what I can tell, all broadcast HDTV is 60Hz & only Blue Ray / 3D utilizes 120Hz.  The EX720 is a 60Hz set with some magical mojo making it mimic 120Hz.  It's very confusing, but I'm fairly confident that the human eye can't spot the difference reliably so paying some extra cash seems foolish.  I only run one HDMI cable to the set from my receiver and switch everything from there, so number / type of connections isn't a concern.Overall I am very happy with the set.  It looks great on the wall, very slim, although the bezel seams large it doesn't bother me.  Great picture quality day or night.  Great performance watching sports (basketball at least) in High Def.  Very easy setup.  I spent less time calibrating this set than any other set in my history ::including friends and families sets::  This was an awesome surprise because typically I expect to spend several hours initially setting up and adjusting for the room, and then tweaking several times to achieve a balance of day / night brightness.  I spent maybe 15 minutes in the settings of the set basically fiddling with options and exploring and still haven't adjusted the picture options.  It is really good out of the box, for me.The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star product, to me, is the viewing angle.  My place is small and while the set is view-able from my kitchen and the angle isn't very steep the screen appears washed out, especially at night.

The advertised 180 degree viewing angle is spot on, I can see the screen clearly across the room at an angle, or laying down on the couch.The picture adjustments are EXCELLENT as well. For gaming, I prefer it to be a touch blurrier, and with the smooth motion setting, even older games look UNBELIEVABLY fantastic (like Final Fantasy XI).For 2D content, games, television, movies etc, everything looks really, REALLY good. The auto-3D setting is kind of \"meh\", it kinda works, but isn't worth using in my opinion. For 3D content, it looks pretty good. Directv has a 3D channel, but the signal is rather compressed and takes away from the viewing experience, however I tried a few PS3 games with 3D support, and they look AWESOME, specifically Mortal Kombat.I haven't delved into the internet functionality too much, but the menus are clear, super responsive, and intuitive to use. I was able to configure my gaming preferences within minutes.The sound quality of the built in speakers is acceptable, but what you would expect from a TV, I keep my stereo hooked up.The other thing that's nice is how thin and light it is. I easily carried it up two flights of stairs in it's packaging, and easily mounted it to my TV stand.

If you are looking for a 3D TV this is not a wise choice. I returned 1 of this and after checking out 2 other models and a KDL-55NX720 at the sony store I found out they all have a serious problem in terms of 3D. The 3D effect decreases to no 3D effect at all at the upper side of the screen. The middle and lower area look OK in 3D with minimal crosstalk, but in the upper side of the screen there is absolute crosstalk, no 3D effect at all. This is more evident when looking at objects with good contrast that are meant to be distant or pop out of the screen. Pay attention to this if you own one of this TVs. Whether it be 3D games, bluray 3D, 3D internet/USB videos or 3D TV signal it's always the same. It is not an HDMI cable issue. It is useless to tweak the picture settings. The dejudder setting makes it even worst.  Some other people reports the same issue but at the lower side of the screen.

Sony BRAVIA KDL55EX720 55 Review", "Author": "PETER", "ReviewID": "R1RA7VS57LOS94", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research trying to decide on a plasma or LED LCD. I decided on LCD for a number of subjective reasons. My room is not wide but long so viewing distance mode is more straight on. Also my room is bright during the day with windows so I opted not to get the gorilla glass. I get very very little reflection.Even though I gave 5 stars the TV is not perfect. More like 4.8 but none of the TV's are perfect. I have owned the TV now for about a month and the picture quality is great. The grays are slightly blue but playing with settings has helped tremendously. Changing to Neutral color helped. I use the Vivid setting and kept smooth on but you can turn it off. Very sharp picture with HD channels and Blu-ray. So sharp you could probably pause and take a picture of your favorite celebrity and stick it on a T-shirt. No Wi-Fi, can add later, but my Play Station 3 works great with its Wi-Fi.The colors are great. I like saturated colors. There are settings to tone it down if you are a realist. Remember color is subjective. Here is an example to help you.Back in the 1980's Fuji film came out with high-resolution film for pictures: very bright over saturated colors. It made dull amateur photo colors bright. Kodak originally said our colors are real which is what photographers want. The ratings in the magazines proved Kodak right but the moms and pops loved it. Hence Kodak gave in and made a separate category High Res film. Color is subjective and plasmas have very good accurate color but are not as bright. On LCD's you can lessen saturation. My friend's new plasma is great but not as good in the daytime in a bright room. But he picked the right TV, he has a wide room. Plasmas have a very good wide view without loss and LCD's have a little loss when you go really wide. I am not into 3D currently.For some reason when I was shopping around a lot of stores were selling against Sony. They're Sony displayed TV's settings were set wrong and looked less color saturated and clear. No way is this right. The Samsungs and Sharps looked good and were set correctly. I went to the Sony Style store and confirmed for myself that Sony TV's are just as good. With all my research I concluded that all LED LCD's are very good and close in quality. Samsung may have an edge on the high end. My price range was below $1600.My choice came down to customer service. I called Samsung, Sharp, LG and Sony technical and sales services. Sony was the best by far.Your room brightens and windows make a difference. Also checkout each manufactures settings to make sure you are capable of making changes.If you are totally not into gizmos then I recommend Sony as the best for you.Special Notes: The smooth setting demonstrated properly for me at the Sony store was something I did not get into at first. It grew on me especially with sports like soccer and now football. The close up player in action looks separated from the background for an amazing very sharp effect. Some salesman will sell against the smooth soap opera effect that most LED LCD's have in favor of plasma but I recommend going to a Sony store for a proper demo no matter which company you buy from.

Many of us owners have been complaining on Avsforum.com and Sony Forums and it will likely never be fixed. The TV is only 120HZ and we believe this is why the 3D suffers. This review does the best job of explaining the problem:[...]2D performance is great! The only issue there is some spotlighting in the lower corners (you see little flashlight beams on a black screen- only annoying during letterbox movies).

All the software apps(like youtube, amazon, hulu etc.) are not very stable, for example when you load a youtube movie, it stops working after like 60 minutes and gives an error message \"Network Error\", You can't do anything from there. I am not a big fan of 3D, So, Haven't tested it. Speakers sucks, but they suck on all TV's. So, I bought a sony home theater system, the \"BDV-E370\". This one works very well with kdl46Ex720. Bravia sync lets you operate both with single TV remote. Do remember to use \"optical audio cable\" for audio out from TV to home theater. HDMI, for audio, does not work between these two systems.

All in all, the picture is just okay.  My friends and I compared this set side by side to the Panasonic LCD TV that I purchased 3 years ago, and we all agreed that the Panasonic picture was better.  I have made all of the recommended (from reviews and from Sony's helpdesk) changes to the picture settings on the TV, and the picture is still mediocre.  Not what I expected from Sony and especially at this price.My 2nd issue with the set is that Sony fails to inform you of all of the extras that one must purchase to receive the full benefit of this TV.  In order for the wireless component to work on this particular set (which is not true of all TV manufacturers such as Vizio), one will need to cough-up another $75+ for Sony's wireless adapter.  Add to this expense roughly $100 for each pair of 3D glasses (again, makers such as Vizio include a pair or 2 on average for free), more for Sony's camera to use Skype (per Sony's on-line help, there is only 1 camera that works for this TV), and another $50 if you have an Apple computer for software (apparently this TV is set-up only for Windows-based computers).  I guess I should be happy that Sony didn't also make me pay for the power chord.Needless to say, I believe that there are better picture quality TVs out there for much less than what you will spend on this unit.

But, here we go.  just like any really HD product, you need other things to go with it, the tv itself is a great tv, the picture is  better then what some non sony tv's have, even in 2D, BUT, as with all 1080p and 3D tv's, if you want true 1080p and you want your 3D movies and games to look right , you need better HDMI cables then low dollar cables, most low buck cables are 1.3k , you need 4k or 3D ready HDMI cables.Also, you need a true 1080p or 3D device to get the true picture from tv's like this. With a high speed HDMI cable running from it to the tv.If you have bought any 1080p or 3D tv and it seems to have a dark picture, ghosting, seems alittle hazy , or if your a gamer and having alittle bit of screen lag, try a higher quality HDMI cable, it should help and dont forget about the tv picture settings.The differant settings are there for a reason. There are websites that can help you set the picture on just about any HD tv made in the last few years, just search Picture settings for \"your tv brand and model\" and you should find a few helpful places.Or just over acouple days times, try differant settings yourself.This thing is great for PS3 gaming by the way.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excelente Producto", "Author": "Jimmy Ronny Uzcategui", "ReviewID": "R2Q71HJDCF3CER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Muy Bien. el televisor en excelentes condiciones.

I have been using professional Sony video equipment for 30 years and I have been very happy with most if not all Sony equipment up to now.  I find the video picture of the HD Sony TV KDL 32 EX 720 not very good.  I had to go into the picture settings to adjust a number of settings before the picture began to looked like the video on my professional monitors.  By the time I cranked the video levels up to get an acceptable picture the blacks areas in the picture looked grey and snowy.  If you want a TV to watch HD this might be a good monitor.  But if you want to use this Sony TV in a professional setting, try another brand this sony does not live up to Sony's previous reputation as a good video equipment producer.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Where Is the SONY Quality?", "Author": "Daniel Chung \"SideWalker\"", "ReviewID": "R3L4A8MRLLG4DR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was considering to buy this model so I went to a retail store to check it out. This was definitely not the SONY I used to know. The fit and finish was so poor that it shocked me. The bezel was made by such a low grade plastic and it was not even straight if you look it from the top of the unit. It had a visible gap between the bezel and the panel in the lower corner. The worst part was the base, which was totally unstable. It is the worst design I have ever seen in any TVs. The picture sharpness was okay but the color was blueish in the dark display. The TV was not in the same class of comparable SHARP and SAMSUNG models. Does anyone know who makes the panel for SONY on this model? I know FOXCONN made a lot of SONY models. It's sad to see that SONY, one of the best names in the industry, has gone down to tier 3 level. Their models are not even close to SAMSUNG or SHARP models in terms of design, built and picture quality. No wonder their sales volume is down. I would rather spend a little more on a SAMSUNG or SHARP model instead.", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony Bravia 60\" 3D LED TV", "Author": "M.

I'm currently having to make changes manually while I wait for a replacement remote.Have very low expectations that the remote will work since I tried using my Harmony remote with the same issues.Sony Support is VERY poor. Tried both Chat and call with similar poor support. Expect to have to request for In-House service to review.

Kelley", "ReviewID": "R11KLUL5NNSTCN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice TV, but Amazon's set-up for the 24-month financing is a joke.Here's the scoop... If you apply for a new Amazon Store card for the 24-month financing offer, GE, the bank who administers the card, says they won't allow a high enough credit limit to purchase this TV unless you have used the card ALOT for other purchases. So, it's a catch-22. Unless you want to pay up front for the difference, you won't be able to buy the TV, which defeats the purpose of a 24-month financing dealI looked elsewhere for true financing deals on this TV... no bait and switch for me, thanks.**** Update April 20Found the TV at Vann's along with a nice financing deal, and their credit limit was more than enough to order the TV... Awesome customer service there, and they beat the Amazon price.
