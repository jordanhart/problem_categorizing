We have it mounted on the wall in our kitchen and attached to a DirecTV high def DVR.  The picture quality is quite good for a bright room such as a kitchen.  The unit has performed flawlessly during the entire 18 months and I hope to get many more years of service out of it.I cannot comment on the audio quality because I've always used an externally powered 2.1 speaker setup.  I assume the speakers are competent but not stellar which is why I've never tried them.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "The LC-C3234U utilizes Sharp's proprietary Advanced Super View/TFT panel providing a high dynamic contrast ratio\nThe LC-C3234U is an HDTV with built-in ATSC/QAM/NTSC tuners.", "Name": "Sharp LC C3234U - 32\" Aquos LCD TV - widescreen - 720p -", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41hG8fJbXyL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0017LXPFI"}}
