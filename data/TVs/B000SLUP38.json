In my opinion this alone is all that most people need to know.However, one of the big selling features of this HDTV is the ability to use it as a wireless media center with your home network so you can play your library of digital music files, videos, and photos all on your wonderful HDTV.The only problem is you have to understand how to set it up or pay someone who does. If you want to understand more you should visit HP's official site about setting up these MediaSmart HDTVs: \"yankthewires\" dot com.The criticism about downloaded movies not being available is no longer an issue with this TV ... if you have it setup right. Just visit the HP site or read the manual about a dozen times and you'll figure out all the cool features.Bottom line, GREAT HDTV.", "Date": "February 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not Happy", "Author": "Don", "ReviewID": "R1SMGG90TJ3P7D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not going to write a long review but over all i am not too happy with this set - main reason i purchased it was for the media capabilities that were advertised.1. cant order movies online - \"coming soon\" is what the menu says - feature is not up and running yet.  No mention from the sales guy.2. video/music off of a server is cool but user interface is not that great.3. picture quality is just average - no where near the top sets in this price range.  If the media capability is not a big deal go look at the Toshiba 120Hz model or the Sharp Aquos in the same price range.  A media box can be purchased seperately and with a much better interface.", "Date": "November 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "One INCREDIBLE TV", "Author": "Arthur L. Nadelman \"Media Center Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R30E69440B4QTY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one incredible TV.  If it didn't include the built-in media center extender it would be fabulous.  The picture quality on this TV far surpasses any of my other 1080p TV's.  But with the added bonus of the media center extender built into it, this is one killer TV.  My whole house is wired with media center extenders.  I run this one wirelessly using the 802.11n interface.  It works flawlessly streaming HD programming and recorded shows from my Vista computer in my media room to my bedroom where I have this TV.  There are nights that I just don't even want to turn it off because of the incredible picture quality.It makes me wish that I had one of these in a 65\" version to put elsewhere in my house.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV, great flexibility, great networking", "Author": "David Rudd \"horn enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R3TI679THAKX6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV and it works amazing for networking in addition to TV, we have 4 networked PCs in our home and the MediaSmart quickly identified all the video, pictures, and music on all PCs running XP or Vista.  It also has Microsoft Media Center with all of it's features built in.  More DTVs should have these great features!", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "The award winning customer services checks out", "Author": "M. Tiesman", "ReviewID": "R3YNSWVPSTF0C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It's a great TV... when it works.The extras were nice, I used the Cinema Now and the Internet radio features quite a bit. Unfortunately, right out of the box I had troubles. I had a Sony DVD player and when I used the component cables for 720P the screen would randomly black out. I was forced to use the standard definition A/V cables. The HP techs said it was a compatibility issue and I would have to buy a new DVD player. I bought and Xbox and had the same issues. 4 more phone calls and 2 repair visits later, they are sending me a new TV.We will see what happens with the new one.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good quality television, all other features are awful", "Author": "Raymond Brigleb", "ReviewID": "R1N9N4JEKX3SHI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was pretty excited about this television. It looks decent and gets a good enough picture. The contrast is a bit lacking, and it doesn't allow much configuration. It has bigger problems with audio - I've not yet been able to get the stereo RCA out to play through my receiver. No idea why. It would \"just work\" with most televisions, with this one it just \"doesn't work.\" That's a real pain.Then there's the \"media\" features. They are terrible. First of all, like many folks I'm a Mac user. So it seems far more logical to plug in an Apple TV and use it's excellent and fuller features - and iTunes compatibility - rather than this obscure thing. Why am I paying for wi-fi and other features when HP couldn't do something more useful with them? How about a simple web browser or something? No, you have to have Windows installed, and then this complicated software and all its patches, then leave your computer wasting energy all the time, just to use this TV's features.It's a complete waste. Maybe HP should get out of making televisions, because their priorities are all wrong. They need to fix the basics, then make their \"icing on the cake\" features compatible with what most people use - iTunes and their iPods.I would choose a different television if I were you!", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "MEGA Media Smart", "Author": "Carl Diaz \"Carlytoes\"", "ReviewID": "R2HBEZCBMXVN55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic for games with your notebook PC.  My family of four can all play Monopoly together in the comfort of our livingroom and watch it on the wall on the big screen.  The HD was a big hit for all the football games on Thanksgiving.  My wife liked that the guys could view the games while interacting with the family and keep them out of the kitchen and diningroom.  Look forward to our open house on New Year's Day with this TV as a source of entertainment.
