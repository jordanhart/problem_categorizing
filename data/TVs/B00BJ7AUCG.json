I really enjoyed this television, but here are some quirks, have to change the TV to DVD to even have the disk inserted, meaning, it is more complicated than it needs to be. I would rather, if I insert a DVD, that it switches automatically, as that is the reason, after all, I am inserting a DVD. I love \"mute\", as I do not tolerate commercials well, mute is a very small button on the remote. The remote is very responsive, but is laid out strangely, in comparison to others. Mine was listed as 1080i and it looked it, Mine has 3 HDMI and a \"-C\" at the end of the model number. Really quite impressed with the resolution and not disappointed with the sound either. All in all, great television and the DVD player is a nice bonus to have it in the package, despite being more manual than it needs to be. I would give the picture quality a solid 5*, sound 4*, remote, 3*= 4* total. Price and overall satisfaction 5*.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV with DVD Player", "Author": "Nicole from Long Island", "ReviewID": "R30SMQ969BOHQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV as I wanted to have a good size tv with the option of playing DVDs.  We have a huge collection of DVDs, especially for my kids, so it is convenient to have a DVD player right built into the TV.  I am very pleased with our purchase.  The TV was easy to set up and looks really nice on the TV stand I got for it.  Picture quality is better than I expected.  Sound quality is definitely adequate - it isn't bose quality speakers, but I have no trouble hearing the TV loudly from across the room.

I just figured it would be cool to have a dual purpose piece of equipment.  The speakers are awful...everything sounds flat and tinny.  The remote must have been designed by a moron. The buttons are not in a logical pattern which might be manageable if the remote was back-lit, but it's not.  The buttons are tiny and the button that is the \"enter\" button on every other remote I have EVER owned is the \"menu\" button on this remote...the \"enter\" button is tiny and lower down on the remote next to other random buttons instead of in the center of the arrow/directional button circular cluster. I guess it could be an odd remote because it has to do more things...all I know is it doesn't  make it easy on the user. DVD's  are not easy to load...I have to turn the equipment off and on until it will accept a DVD...rarely will it take a DVD without some sort of fiddling around.  As a monitor it functions very nicely.  I can work on my giant spreadsheets at home and not have to try and read them and make adjustments to them on my laptop's tiny screen.  This will surely keep me from going blind at an early age!  The monitor function of this unit is a winner.  I bought the add-on wall mount arm Amazon paired with this item and it is fabulous.
