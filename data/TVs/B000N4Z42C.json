{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great picture, with only minor drawbacks", "Author": "fluffy", "ReviewID": "R22ACESSWKNV92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been putting this television through its paces since I got it a few weeks ago, and it is by far the best TV I have ever owned, and very difficult to beat.  The image quality is really good, with bright, vivid colors and wonderful detail, especially for 1080i/p content, but even lower-resolution 720p content, which is what's more commonly-available on OTA HD broadcast, looks phenomenal.  I also have an Apple TV hooked up to it, and even though most of my content is encoded at either 360p, 480p, or 720p, it still looks quite good.It does take some time to get the image tuned to perfection, and the default settings are way too bright with too much color saturation boost, and the DNIe processing system actually seems to make some motion effects worse.  However, it's very easy to change the settings and see immediately what effect they have.Like all LCDs it does have some slight black point problems; these aren't noticeable for fullscreen 16:9 content, but for older 4:3 content it's pretty obvious that the black isn't pure black.  However, this is again tunable.The only thing I really notice which is pretty annoying is that it doesn't do a very good job of upscaling 480i content, such as the output from most video game systems, and for DVDs to look good you really need an upconverting player since even with a progressive-scan player there is a lot of visible pixelation when the 480p content is scaled up.  It's really more a sad reflection on how the previous \"next-generation\" video looks downright primitive by today's standards.The other noticeable issue is that unlike many televisions with digital tuners, it doesn't have an on-screen program guide.  My previous TV (also a Samsung) had an on-screen program guide, but it was rather cumbersome to use and took several minutes of scanning every channel to see what was on, and most local channels are pretty inconsistent about providing the EPG information anyway, so it's not really that big of a deal.  You can still see the detailed information for the program that's currently showing, so it makes use of EPG, just not as much as it could.This television's tuner is also quite phenomenal.  My previous TV required a very carefully-positioned powered antenna which was very sensitive to every little nearby fluctuation, while with this one I only have a piece of wire jammed into the antenna port and I get perfect reception of every local digital station.Another nice improvement over Samsung's older HDTVs is that it has a wide variety of zoom modes which allow you to counteract some of the stupider things that TV stations do (for example, pillboxing a letterboxed 16:9 show, which is very common for widescreen non-HD programming).  Also, analog TV stations and source inputs get their audio signals upconverted to digital, so you only need to run a single optical audio connection to your stereo (while previous Samsungs required running both analog and digital cables and switching between the two inputs based on source material).As a PC monitor this is also quite nice.  I have a Mac mini hooked up via SVGA cable, and even with an analog signal it looks perfectly sharp and crystal-clear, and of course you can hook it up via HDMI (with a DVI to HDMI adaptor) as well.  The only gripe there is that the supported resolutions are a bit quaint - at least on analog SVGA the only 16:9 resolution it supports is 1920x1080, which can be difficult for some older systems to handle.  However, on HDMI it should support all the standard HD resolutions.This television may be more expensive than others in its size class, but it also far outshines every other TV I have seen, aside from the newer LN-T4065, which is nearly identical aside from providing a higher dynamic contrast ratio.  If you want to only buy one TV which will last for a long time, it would be hard to go wrong with this one.", "Date": "April 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Exceptional", "Author": "Scott Hilleque", "ReviewID": "R34VLDW19F98OQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the LN-T4061 for a week now and am still very impressed.  The picture quality is excellent, build quality is solid, and ease-of-use is very good too.  I am using it with an HD cable box, a Media Center PC, and a home theater receiver.  In all cases, connecting and configuring the various inputs was completely obvious and pain free.General Image: The colors are absolutely amazing.  I've looked at a LOT of LCDs over the past few months and I can't recall any of them looking this vibrant.  The 10,000-to-1 contrast ratio really makes for a stunning image.  The black level is very good for an LCD too, but not quite pitch-black.  Since I like to watch movies at night in a dark room, I can pick out a tiny amount of dark grey if I'm looking for it.  Still, it's much better than most LCDs and the high contrast ratio makes dark scenes look much better.  If you look at LCDs in a store, you'll notice they always play bright, contrasty video.  That's because most LCDs have a problem showing the difference between dark colors, like in shadows and night scenes.  The Samsung isn't perfect, but it doesn't wash out nearly as bad as the others I sampled.Image Settings:  You can fine tune picture settings (Color, Contract, Brightness, etc.) or use one of the built-in presets.  The default setting was a little \"over driven\" for my eyes, so I stepped it back to the next level and haven't had to touch it since.  All settings are stored per-input, which is how it should be.High Definition: Both of my sources output in HD, the cable box at 1080i and the HTPC at 1080p.  I give it 5 stars each in image quality, color fidelity, lack of pixilation, and lack of motion tear.Standard Definition:  I don't really have an SD source anymore as my cable box and HTPC up-convert the content to HD.  I did connect an S-Video cable just to try it out though, and was generally satisfied with the picture.  There were definitely artifacts of scaling and de-interlacing, but they mostly disappeared to my eye at couch distance (about 12 feet).  I didn't give it the close scrutiny I did with the HDMI and component connections though.HDMI Inputs: I am using only one of the three HDMI jacks, and that for connecting the cable box.  In the past I would leave the TV volume at 100% and use the PVR's internal volume control to set the final level.  Over HDMI though, you always have full volume going to the TV.  The easy work-around for this was to train the cable remote to use the TV codes for volume.  This works great and the picture quality is excellent.  I also read a forum post about the TV \"handshaking\" intermittently over an HDMI connection, but I haven't experienced it.  Also, on a side note, do NOT buy expensive HDMI cables.  The signal is 100% digital and doesn't benefit in any significant way from a $150 \"OFC\" or \"directional\" cable.  If you need a run of 50' or more it's a different story, but at 6' it's a non-issue.Component Inputs:  Before I got the HDMI cable, I used the component jacks for a few days and I can't say that I noticed any difference when I went to HDMI.  It's nice having a single cable instead of the 5 for component, but I couldn't tell one way or another.Audio:  The built in 10-watt speakers are not enough for immersive movie watching, but they do just fine for regular TV shows.  Coupled with a home theater sound system, you've got the best of both worlds; easy operation for normal stuff and theater sound for movies.On-Screen Menus:  It has a nicely polished translucent on-screen menu system.  The layout is simple, features that don't apply are grayed out, and the hierarchy is logical.  What more can you ask for.Remote Control: I use the cable PVR's remote most of the time, and had no trouble adding Samsung's codes to it.  The Samsung remote is actually quite nice, but there are enough special features built into the cable remote (PVR, guide, A B & C buttons, etc) that I prefer to make that the normal clicker.  I still keep the TV remote handy though as there are a few features the other remote won't do when watching movies.  I wish I could do it all with just one, but I guess that's where remotes like the Logitech Harmony come in.Cabinet:  Personally, I don't like \"shiny\" media equipment; they just cause glare and distract from what you are really watching.  The frame is somewhat shiny but the screen it totally matte.  In my opinion, it's a nice mix and looks quite professional.  I was worried about the WAF, but the first words out of her mouth were \"wow, its pretty\".  That's good enough for me.Other:  I played around with the \"digital picture frame\" mode some and it is kind of neat.  You plug a USB stick into the side and it does a slide show of the photos and music on it.  I probably won't use it as I have a media center PC, but those that don't might find it useful.  That same USB slot is also used to do firmware upgrades, which is a lot better than shipping it off to a service center if an incompatibility ever crops up.All in all I am extremely pleased with this TV.  I waited a long time for 1080p prices to fall to levels that would fit my budget and I'm really happy I chose this one.  There aren't many reviews out there for this year's model yet, but I expect this one to take off big time.", "Date": "April 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture quality for TV, PC, gaming, movies", "Author": "Michael Yuen \"www.hkss.com (or) www.yuenStudi...", "ReviewID": "R3GODYJ8U3OYOB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are some really good reviews of this TV already, and I will add to them my own good (and bad) experiences.PROS: Excellent picture quality. Plenty of input sources, including VGA (for computers/laptops.) Sexy design and good value.CONS: Some minor design issues. Remote control is laggy.SUMMARY: You can't go wrong with this unit. I like it a lot.DETAILED REVIEW:Like Phil, I also had in mind to use this TV for all my multimedia needs: computer, Playstation 2 Slim, Over-the-Air (OTA) HD TV, and of course, movies. I live in a 2-bedroom apartment and didn't want anything less than 1080p. I also do not subscribe to cable or satellite TV due to the fact that I do not (yet) see the necessity to pay $50/month for something I don't really use.The television brands I was primarily considering were the Sharp Aquos and Samsung units. I settled for this TV due to the number of input options, good value (price), and sexy looks. I chose LCD over Plasma because of what I intended to primarily use the TV for: computer use,  gaming, and lower chances of picture \"burn-ins\" that older-generation Plasma is known for.Keep in mind that this review is written with the TV brightness set at 70%, as running it at 100% would shorten the lifespan of the LCD. At full 100% brightness, the television definitely is a stunner! The unit has also been configured to detect changes in room lighting and automatically adjust the brightness accordingly.COMPUTER USE:This is what I use this unit for primarily. Excellent image quality despite connecting a 1920x1080 resolution laptop to the Samsung with a regular VGA-to-VGA cable. My next laptop will likely have a DVI video port -- when that happens, I definitely recommend a DVI-to-HDMI cable. Text is sharp and images are bright and vivid. Playing recorded HD television programs is bliss, and playing BBC's/Discovery Channel's Planet Earth mini-series at 780p has blown away the mind of every single person who wanted to see what this TV is capable of. My laptop could not smoothly handle the 1080p version, but that has nothing to do with the TV.Computer games looked excellent and no blurring was noticeable. Games included Command and Conquer: Tiberium Wars, Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault, Need for Speed: Carbon, and many more.I agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned how amazingly bad DVD movies look when compared to today's available HD programs. But again, this has nothing to do with this TV at all as DVD video is becoming an outdated standard. The DVD movies were played through the laptop with no upscaling whatsoever. Blu-Ray simply looks amazing on this unit when my friend fired up his Playstation 3 with a Blu-Ray movie! The same can be said about HD-DVD when my brother hooked up his Xbox360 and a HD-DVD movie.PHOTOGRAPHY USE:When viewing my images, they look absolutely amazing! I am a hobbyist photographer (with ambitions to go pro) with a Canon EOS 30D digital SLR (see some examples of these images posted on Amazon.com by searching for the Canon 30D and going through the customer-supplied photos. The camera itself is astonishing.)Friends and family marvel at how sharp and vibrant the photos look on this set.PLAYSTATION 2 SLIM USE:Picture quality was horrible when connecting the PS2Slim to the TV set with the included PS2 RCA cables. I read that buying the optional PS2 S-Video cable would improve picture quality, and so I went out to get one. It sure did help, but the games still look bad (but playable.) Suffice to say, the PS2 was never designed for HD. Get the PS3 or Xbox360 instead.OVER-THE-AIR TELEVISION USE:There wasn't true 1080p content available for me to receive over the air. The closest was 1080i, and although most people said that it looked amazing, I'm a picky computer professional when it comes to picture quality. Nonetheless, it definitely played analog broadcast channels better than my dad's Philips set. Those channels that I am able to receive (mostly 720p) looks pretty stunning.One qualm I have about this unit is that it doesn't seem to have an auto-resize functionality that would turn everything into widescreen. The manual recommends that full-screen content not be played for too long on ANY television set (not just this Samsung), as the difference between the actual video content and the black bars on the side may become a problem over time. You can force any video (except for the computer feed) into widescreen by using the included remote. I like how my dad's Philips unit resizes everything into widescreen, though I don't like how fullscreen content looks stretched when forced to widescreen.Personally, I leave fullscreen content at fullscreen and take my chances. I did not know that LCDs could have \"burn-in\" problems, but hey, never say never.MOVIE USE:Video quality looks STUNNING. The blacks are, of course, not as black as Plasma televisions, but it's really not that noticeable. There's no noticeable ghosting and action sequences look quite good. Colors are vibrant. I watch my movies with the lights on.SOUND:The built-in speakers are not bad, but when compared to the THX-certified Logitech Z-5500 Digital speakers I use with my computer, it's like comparing a Honda with a BMW. I like both car makers. I have hooked up the television unit to the Logitech speakers with an optical audio cable, and you can definitely notice the difference in optical vs standard RCA-type cables. Surround sound comes from the right places, and some of the television shows actually provide engaging surround sound! The problem with optical cables is that audio is always sent at full volume to the speakers. So, you'll have to control the sound volume with the speaker remote instead.The unit boasts a feature that would auto-level sound coming from each TV channel so that while you're flipping through the channels, the difference in volumes of those channels would not be so noticeable. In other words, as you're flipping through a more silent channel to a loud one, the loud one should automatically be adjusted by the TV to match the quieter one. I was not able to get this feature to work even though it's turned on in the setup. Perhaps it's because I'm having the sound go through the optical audio cables. Remember, optical cables always sent the full volume to the speakers. I haven't had a chance to try it without the optical audio cable yet. I like optical audio too much to let go of it :-)VISUAL DESIGN OF THE TV:It's sexy and gets compliments from everyone who has seen it. The glossy piano finish definitely gives it a high-class edge. I chose not to buy the 4065F model because the 4061F one does a better job of minimizing glare. The television does work like a dust magnet. Dust collects easily as another reviewer pointed out. Keep your feather duster handy for once-every-2-week use.The swivel base is nice. It allows you to turn the TV into a desired position.MISC:- This unit allows you to label the various input sources so that when you switch between them, it shows what you're looking at. It does not, however, allow you to completely customize the names of the predefined labels.- There's a feature in the setup that shows you the signal strength of the TV source. This has helped me optimally position my antenna.- The remote control doesn't feel as nice as it looks, and pushing the buttons shows noticeable lag between then they were pushed and when the TV responds. Somebody else pointed out this minor flaw too.- Another reviewer also pointed out that there is a lag between the power button is pushed and when the display shows something. He/she shared that his/her mother kept turning on/off the TV while thinking that it wasn't working. Indeed there is such a lag while the television \"readies\" itself. You can tell whether the TV is responding or not by looking at the red LED of the power button: when you push to turn on the set, it starts blinking, followed by a sound after a couple seconds. When you turn off the set, a sound is played to indicate that it has been turned off. This lag is true with most LCDs, however, including computer LCDs.I do wish that instead of utilizing a blinking status indicator that the TV is turning on, that they would transition the solid red (off) into solid blue (on), for example. I think the 4065F model does that.All said and done, I highly recommend this television and would give it 5 stars if it weren't for some of the minor design issues.----------------EDIT 11/7/2007: TV's still functioning beautifully and I am still very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "THE REAL REALITY TV!", "Author": "HSPevolved Archer", "ReviewID": "R2X1LGZAT7PTCZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the most wonderful yet impractical purchase I have ever made. Samsung did a great job on this one. The first impression is that your living room has become a movie theater. Yet this home cinema is without a doubt a totally unnecessary luxury. Having said that let me share with you a few useful remarks that'll help set your expectations.Attributes & pointers:1- Picture Quality: it is so awesome you can see a blemish on someone's face as if they were standing in front of you. You can see every drop of sweat on Kobe's (Lakers!) biceps with such definition; you would think he is playing in your living room. You get the point...2- Watching Movies: you need a DVD player with upconverting capability to watch movies in full HD (1080p) - under $1003- Computer Monitor: you need HDMI-DVI cable [$5 or less] & 1/8' miniplug to red & white RCA cable [$10-25] to transform your TV to a computer monitor which operates in full HD (1080p). It only works with \"HDMI in1\" port. The shock effect here is beyond any considerations especially if you tend to use your computer to watch video. Note: I have not tried the DVI-15pin video + 3.5 mm M/M audio connection to compare, but it can not be better since I am getting 1080p resolution in my current HDMI-DVI configuration.4- Cable/Dish: you need a cable box (or dish receiver) [$10-15 monthly] with HDMI port in order to take full advantage of the HD channels. The TV has an aerial port but it is poor quality in comparison. In addition, component video and DVI connections from cable box to TV are also poor quality compared to HDMI.5- Non-HD TV channels: this TV has DNIe technology chip with converts the standard TV (non-HD) channels from 480i to 1080i resolution, which is awesome. No other brand has this kind of capability. It might be 18 months or more before the standard TV channels start broadcasting in HD. Meanwhile everyone else is painfully tracking the movements of an object on other brand LCD panels and you're watching it in movie theater quality. No visibly flying pixels in Samsung land so far!6- HDMI cables: to connect your cable box or DVD player to your TV you need an HDMI-HDMI cable. These cables are one of the biggest scams on the market. Belkin & monster cables are selling them for $70-150 for a 6 feet cable. You can find the equivalent for $2 (Inspire Electronics- an Amazon seller). I mean it, and they work as good. You won't know the difference; I guarantee it. I own both the $100 & $2 cables and I use them interchangeably. Man, the mercantilism.7- Sound: the TV panel comes with true built-in surround sound. I am happy with its quality. I know it is not as good as a bulky surround with multiple speakers over which kids can trip or two good neighbors may easily fight; but it is mighty good.Drawbacks:1- if you are reading this, then you are already on the right track in choosing a TV. However, it takes a fair amount of research to get here.2- after purchase, you have to have some technology savvy and willingness to spend few hours in research and shopping for equipment to fully transform your new TV into a home theater/computer monitor.3- THE MISSING STAR: (Picture in Picture) this TV only has a single NTSC tuner, which means it runs one HD source at a time. You cannot see two TV channels in HD simultaneously or use the TV as a computer monitor and still watch HDTV at the same time. However, there is a solution to that. You may re-install your radio frequency (RF) cable from your cable box (RF out) to the TV (RF in). This way, while using your TV as a computer monitor, you can watch a TV channel using old-fashioned standard TV quality.4- we know nothing about this TV's longevity. this is one of the latest Samsung rollouts, and no one knows whether it'll live for 5 months or 5 years. My old SDTV lasted 9 years. I doubt it will be the same this time.5- there are no full HD (1080P) channels on Comcast cable TV yet. There are few 1080i channels like espn & TNT and your local news blablabla and subscription sports packages but no 1080p channels, none. It might take until 2009 until you can see those. Essentially when it comes to full HD you can only see it watching movies from your DVD player or while using the TV as a computer monitor.Overall, wonderful yet completely unnecessary upgrade to your media experience.UPDATE 10/16/07:TV still running impeccably; no problems at all. sound is good & everything and the image ah! as good as it gets. Calibrating an HDTV has proven to be a real challenge though. this is not specific to samsung however. One additional drawback, the TV is slow to respond to the remote, and sometimes you have to click twice in order to execute. no big deal, a universal remote is needed for most entertainment systems anyway.Note: there is plenty of contrast on this TV. no need for the additional expense to get the 4065!", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "I hate to say it but...", "Author": "Curtis Hickman", "ReviewID": "R1T9GRGN02QZ56", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I knew that buying an HDTV on line was a bit risky. However, I went and found this model television in the stores and thought that it looked great. So I decided to give it a chance. Now I know there is usually a reviewer that gives a product a bad rating based on his experience... and I hate to be that guy... but the television hasn't worked right from day one. I have two long rows of dead pixels in my TV. Furthermore, the optical out wasn't functioning correctly. A guy \"from Samsung\" eventually showed up with a board that he replaced and that fixed the audio problem but not the image. I am now waiting in Limbo for Samsung to make up their minds as to what to do next. I have had this TV for almost a month now and believe me if I had known what I would be going through I would NEVER have purchased it. Sure it's a good price for a TV... but beware this TV can end up costing you more than you think.UPDATE: Well I DID get a new TV from Samsung. I wish I had gone to Amazon first... but... well live and learn. Since I got my new- new TV I have to say I love it! I'm watching HDTV for free with a cheep digital indoor antenna that I got from a local store. The picture is amazing. Watching Heroes and Lost in HD 5.1 surround sound is awesome.

Simply put, this TV met every one of these challenges.First up on my agenda was hooking up the PC. I hooked this up via a DVI to HDMI adapter. My PC recognized it immediately and I quickly had my PC looking as vivid as ever on this Samsung.  However, I did have some driver issues in attempting to set a resolution of 1920x1080, but after a few tweaks, I had it running flawlessly. My only complaint is that 1920 resolution is kind of hard on the eyes from a distance--more pronounced during web browsing and text reading. I do, however, always use 1920 res for gaming as it looks quite marvelous and requires little to no squinting for text reading (many games such as WoW allow you to increase the font size anyway)! I tested Half-Life 2, Quake 4, World of Warcraft, and a multitude of other games. In a word, it was simply breathtaking. It took a while to calibrate the display accordingly, but I eventually found a sweet spot for it. This TV will surely provide bragging rights if any of your gaming friends decide to hop on over to your place.The 360, like the PC, looked wonderful. My connection was through an HDMI cable provided in the X-box 360 Elite. Games looked crisp and colorful, and the blacks were quite impressive for an LCD. Movies through the Xbox Live Marketplace were truly a sight to behold as well. Why bother with HD-DVD and Blu-ray when you got great HD movies right here?! Unfortunately, I do not possess any pure native 1080p games, but i'll be sure to test them out soon enough.After I was done with the 360, it was finally time for regular HD cable TV. It was amazing to be sure. Again, calibration took some time, as you can't use the same PC/360 calibrations as you do with regular HD movies. I made sure to take a brief look at the AVSforums for some recommended calibrations--make sure you do the same too! As for cable channels, my only complaint is that Comcast doesn't carry enough HD channels! I don't know the reasoning behind the hold up for television stations not making the HD jump yet. It's almost heartache to try to watch SD channels after watching a few HD Sopranos episodes or some HBO/Showtime HD movies. So in that sense, the only flaw of this TV is that SD pretty much sucks, and it needs to pass away as soon as possible. The HD programming, otherwise, was top notch, and looked sharper than ever on this Samsung display. It's almost scary to imagine what 1080p is like in comparison with 720p--although, the difference is sure to be more pronounced with larger displays than this 40 inch one.As for the general features of this TV, they are clean and simple enough for the general layman to understand. The TV menu offers simple calibration settings which can be furthered by some advanced calibration settings--again, I would try to test out some of the calibration settings provided by the AVSforums. The audio and video hook ups were rather plain, but the bare essentials are obviously there. The most appealing aspect of the AV hook ups is that this Samsung monitor provides 3 HDMI inputs--for the techies out there with multiple HDMI devices, this is a wonderful treat. The frame of this TV is quite clean and while it can reflect light, my TV is placed in a certain angle to avoid any reflections what so ever. The onboard sound of this Samsung is mediocre at best--but, hey, what internal sound is ever good? If you're buying a nice TV like this, then you're most likely buying a nice home theater set up as well. So make sure to pick one up!Ultimately, this TV is a must purchase. I was skeptical after viewing multiple HDTV's at Circuit City, Best Buy, and Tweeter. In fact, the one Best Buy model was constantly having drop outs (a somewhat minor but known issue). As such, I was quite hesitant and was leaning more towards the TV next to it, the 40 inch Sony XBR, whose quality was more of the same, except without the drop outs. Additionally, I was debating between the 4065f instead of the 4061f, as the former provided 'better' technical specs, and more specifically, an emphasis on contrast ratio and impressive blacks. However, after purchasing this TV and evaluating it for quite a while, I can honestly say it is generally without flaws. If you find yourself teetering on the border of purchasing either this, the Sony, or the LNT4065f, go with this. I can't imagine justifying a 200 dollar increase for a reflective screen, and 'technical' stats (contrast ratio) that can barely improve on what already exists on this TV. As for the Sony, well, we all know the ridiculous dollar increases with that brand. This TV wins hands down.", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Our First Digital TV", "Author": "MnM", "ReviewID": "R2DJ3SRYS8GK0Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We finally decided to take the plunge and get a digital TV.  We're only getting digital/HD signals over-the-air (OTA) because we're not ready to upgrade to an HD satellite receiver or HD DVD/Blue Ray DVD player.  But since reception of analog TV in our area is horrible it's nice to be able to get a clear picture with the digital broadcasts.  Now we can watch the local channels that Dish Network doesn't carry.We decided on the LNT-4061F for it's size, features and price (got a \"Black Friday\" door buster deal).  We have limited space for a wide-screen TV in our entertainment center so a 40\" was about as big as we could fit.  It's perfect for the distance we sit from the TV (about 8 feet).  We like all of the input options, especially the ones for legacy systems since we don't have any HDMI components yet.  But we wanted a \"future proof\" set because we plan on keeping it for 10+ years.  We currently don't get any 1080p signals but at least this unit will be able to display them when we do.Features we like best:* Great picture on OTA digital signals.* Great viewing angle, almost as good as a CRT TV.* VGA PC input.* 2 S-Video and composite video inputs* 2 Component video inputs* 3 HDMI inputs (for future use)* Optical audio output (to send 5.1 audio to A/V receiver)* USB input for showing pictures and playing MP3 music.Things we are disappointed with:* Only fair quality on non-digital sources (like most digital TVs)* None of the listed remote control codes work on our DISH Networksatellite receiver.* Remote control cannot operate an A/V Receiver* Cannot custom name input options (must select from a list)* Cannot directly access input options, you have to scroll through all of the inputs that have something connected even if the connected component is off.* No video outputs (to record directly from the TV)* Mute icon appears when you mute the sound, won't go away until you un-mute.  I did find out how to do an internal mute but you have to go through the setup menu to turn in off and on.* The Picture In Picture (PIP) feature sucks!  It can only be used to view analog TV in a sub picture while viewing Component, HDMI or PC source.  Can't understand why you can't view another source (like S-video) while watching OTA digital channel???  You also can't swap the main picture with the sub picture, however you can view both pictures side by side.  But it's only useful if you want to watch an analog TV tuner source.  Makes the PIP feature practically useless.One thing to consider when getting a flat panel TV to replace an old CRT TV is that you can't put your old center speaker on top of the TV anymore because it's too big.  Also, fast action video can look blurry, especially when the camera pans back and forth.  This seems to be common as we noticed it when looking at other LCD TVs.  Supposedly this is mitigated with 120HZ refresh rate but we were'nt willing to fork over an extra $400 for this feature (see Samsung LNT4069 40\" 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV).  But after watching for a few days it doesn't seem to be as noticeable anymore.  It's kind of like when we first brought home our 32\" CRT TV and noticed the tiny black lines that didn't show on our 19\" TV.  Eventually we got used to it and it didn't bother us anymore.Since this is our first Digital TV we're generally satisfied because we got a smoke'n deal.  The limitations of the universal remote is a big draw back for us since we thought it would be able to control our satellite receiver.  But at least our Sat. receiver's remote can control the TV so we'll be able to live with it.Update:  After a couple of years we noticed that there is major burn-in on the screen after watching a program in 3:4 format.  Even after only a couple of hours the side bars get temporarily burnt in.  Fortunately these go away eventually.  I'd recommend getting something with burn-in protection after this experience.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Top notch picture quality and features for a reasonable price", "Author": "JPL", "ReviewID": "R1C9T5SLE7RAFI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS: HDMI v1.3, great picture w/ deep blacks, lots of calibration options, minimal profileCONS: glossy finish, annoying menu quirksI've had this TV for a few weeks, and now that I've gotten the set calibrated I've been amazed by the picture. I had a Sony Wega CRT HDTV (30\") that had a fantastic picture but I wanted a bigger TV. I also have a relatively bright room, so I wanted to see how a matte screen LCD would perform with a lot of ambient light. (This is why I didn't go with the Samsung LN-T4065F which has a highly reflective glass screen.) Having the matte screen has been great, there is considerably less glare that I have to deal with which makes up for the minor reduction in PQ going from CRT to LCD. Also, the hidden speakers on the bottom give this set a fairly minimal profile; it doesn't have big speakers along the sides or bottom which - in my opinion - make a TV look bulky. Other folks have mentioned poor sound quality from the hidden speakers but I haven't been disappointed. For games and movies I'm running the sound through my stereo system anyway.I'll provide my impressions by content.- XBox 360 (via component) output at 1080p: *amazing* detail and color. Since these are video games I'm not concerned about getting color \"right\", I'm more interested in \"pop\". Very vivid without crushing blacks too much. Response time is excellent, no noticeable lag.- Dish ViP 622 DVR (via HMDI) output at 1080i: this is a tough one to rate since most of the processing is happening in the DVR before it sends the picture to the TV. I can say this much: pure 1080i content that doesn't have much motion (such as \"SNL\" on NBC-HD) is fantastic. If you're willing to spend time getting the picture settings correct you will be very impressed. Unfortunately the compression that Dish uses (MPEG-4) leaves a lot to be desired for fast moving content. With a TV of this size sitting at normal viewing distance you will see the artifacts, but again it's not the fault of the TV. 720p broadcasts (such as ESPN-HD) appear to be a little better if you switch the DVR to output at 720p.- Sony DVD player (via component) output at 480p: the Samsung does a very good job upscaling the picture, it's not jittery at all. The level of detail during dark scenes is extremely impressive; the blacks are not as good as my CRT but still very deep.My only complaints about this set are very minor. The glossy finish is OK when the set is turned off but I don't like the glare when I'm actually watching TV. Using the menu (as noted by others) is a little slow, but it also skips back to the previous menu screen after only a few seconds. Somewhat annoying if you're doing lots of calibrations. I've also been unable to get truly white whites when using the Warm2 picture mode (even though Warm2 is as close as this set gets to 6500 K) but I still need to play with the settings a bit.Overall very very happy with this TV. The picture settings definitely need work out of the box but all LCDs do. Spend some time calibrating the set and you'll get a great picture. And with all the connection options (and HMDI v1.3) this is a TV you can keep for a long time.

I have also owned this TV for about 3 months and am very happy with it!I don't like to watch TV, commercials, or any other such nonsense. Therefore, I do not have regular network TV of any kind. Instead I use this TV in conjunction with a media center computer (temporarily a laptop).In my opinion, computer screens usually feature a higher level of sharpness and quality than ordinary TVs. I therefore was looking for a TV that was basically a big computer screen. I looked at many many brands and ended up settling on Samsung. They seemed to offer the highest degree of sharpness, best color, and most inputs over any other brand. And compared with the rest of Samsung's lineup (January 2008), this TV offered the best picture at the best price.SHARPNESS / RESOLUTION 10/10:This is the FIRST TV I have ever seen that meets my standards in terms of text quality and sharpness to pass as a computer monitor. At 1920x1080 text is very difficult to read for most people. To operate my computer I set the text DPI to 200dpi. This makes all the text and icons much larger while still running at 1920x1080. I am sitting about 10 feet away from the TV and it looks great. Additionally, HD content looks amazing but non-HD content doesn't look horrible like on some TVs. This may be because I am using a computer so upconverting is performed very well.COLOR / CONTRAST 9/10:The colors on this TV are very vibrant without being overpowering. Also, a few days before I received this TV, I had borrowed a budget LCD screen from a friend. I noticed a slight graininess in the color quality. This is NOT present on this LCD. The screen is also very bright and fairly evenly lit. No dead pixels that I could notice. Also, the dynamic contrast setting sometimes doesn't catch people's faces in low light. There are times when the screen actually seems a tad bit dark. This usually isn't a problem though.SOUND 5/10:Sound is certainly decent, but I am not particularly impressed either. I have seen 32 inch LCDs from other brands that had significantly stronger speakers. However, for general use, the speakers definitely do their job.INPUTS 10/10:I do not have the hardware to try every possible input on this TV, but the ones I have tried seem to perform very well. I am currently using a laptop computer with a stereo mini cable for audio and a 6ft analog VGA cable for video and computer. Honestly, the VGA seems to be the best! When I connected a computer using DVI (DVI to HDMI), the image was almost over-sharpened. Text became difficult to read and things seemed a little washed out. However, after some tweaking I got the DVI connection to look very nice. The standard composite inputs seem to do very well, and connecting an Xbox 360 at 1080p is a blast.MENU / FIRMWARE 5/10:The menus of the TV seem fairly complete. Not much to complain about other than the rather slow performance. The menu is laggy enough that I sometimes end up impatiently pressing a button multiple times and then it takes me a relatively long time to undo that action or get back to where I was. With such sophisticated technology, how much extra would it cost to get a super-fast overlay menu system? Doesn't seem like it should be an issue.CONSTRUCTION 10/10:The overall design of this TV is pretty good. It looks fantastic, and feels reasonably sturdy. It definitely wouldn't hold up to too much of a beating, but I am very careful with my electronics and I imagine the TV will last for years to come.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS:If you plan to use this TV with a computer, I would recommend a Logitech's VX Nano laser mouse and MediaBoard Pro with a Bluetooth adapter. I set that up, and it all works really well.PROS:Looks, construction, inputs, sharpness and image qualityCONS:Sound, laggy menu, oversharpening HDMI from DVI sources, contrast in low lightingBOTTOM LINE:If you want a sharp, color-accurate, large, high-resolution, amazing 1080p TV at an affordable price, look no further.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Extremely Satisfied", "Author": "RedHawkRhetor", "ReviewID": "RJCOV1ZV0CTRH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great television, especially in a room with lots of windows and light.  The matte finish screen simply does not reflect any clear images of the windows it faces, and any light reflection is so blurry that it does not appear to affect the picture at all.  The crispness of the HD picture surpasses everything I've seen in this price range, even at a relatively low backlight setting of 4 (out of 10). The possible viewing angle is so wide that you can actually sit at about 70 degrees off center and still see everything well.  (I find that you can indeed see the image even at about 80-85 degrees, but the color appears a bit off). The only problem I have had is that the remote doesn't fully interface with our (non-Samsung) DVD player.  I can do the basics -- play, stop, menu, on/off -- but it will not pause, reverse, or fast forward. Trying different codes did not help, but I admit that I gave up trying after the first 40 or so had no effect (and the code specified in the book gave me the limited functioning described above). This hasn't been a big issue for me as I simply use my DVD player remote instead.  After all, I wasn't buying the TV for its remote.I was also extremely happy with the Eagle delivery and purchase through Amazon. I had originally bought this same model through a relatively well regarded webvendor with solid reviews from CNET and others who proceeded to jerk me around and ultimately sent me the wrong television.  After about a month of \"it's in the mail\" and \"we didn't get your email\" and \"you need to talk to X, who is off today\" and \"we sent it three days ago, I don't know what happened\" I finally gave up and ordered from Amazon.  I ordered on Friday, the delivery was arranged on Monday, and the TV arrived on Tuesday. The Eagle delivery man helped me unpack it and waited until we had confirmed that it was working properly before leaving.  In the meantime, I am still waiting for the other vendor to refund my credit card.  For the past week it's been \"I thought that was already done,\" \"I promise to take care of it today,\" \"I'm sorry but I waited too late on Friday before sending that so it didn't get processed until Monday,\" \"The problem must be with your credit card company, because I'm sure we've sent the request in by now,\" \"No, you can't talk directly to our billing agents because they don't take outside calls,\" and \"Give me a few days to look into this and see if I can figure out what's wrong.\"  Like Amazon they've been polite on the phone.  Unlike Amazon they've been unable to deliver the product as promised.Bottom line: If you want a great 1080p 40\" with matte finished screen at this price, this is the best option I've found (and I looked for about four months).  The Samsung 4065 has even higher resolution and is also a deal, but it has the glossy screen that reflects more light so it was not a good option for me.  Finally, if you want to get it fast and for nearly the best price, get it from Amazon.", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "awesome value overall", "Author": "I.

For the price, you simply cannot find a better panel.  I also considered the LNT-4065F, but it was a little too wide for my armoire, and the glossy screen on that model made me a little nervous, since there's lots of windows in the room I use it in.The picture quality is amazing with a good 720p/1080i source, and SDTV signals are completely tolerable, sometimes even as good as a nice CRT.  There are configuration tutorials available on the web for picture tuning novices, and using one of them myself and then tweaking for my lighting situation and personal tastes has resulted in picture quality that I am genuinely thrilled with.  The TV has plenty of inputs, a great, easy to use remote, and is visually appealing (even if the glossy piano black falls easy prey to dust).The sound isn't great, but that's to be expected from TV's these days.  It's no worse than most other flat panels, and better than some.  I found that using the equalizer in the menu system to reduce the lower frequency channels compared to the others helps a whole lot with getting rid of the harshness and clipping the speakers can produce at factory settings.  Bottom line, if you're serious about sound, buy some external speakers.  For casual gaming, movie and tv watching, these speakers are fine.  They will not immerse you in the aural experience, and I don't know why anyone would expect them to.All in all, I really couldn't be happier with the purchase, and Amazon provided awesome value and service as usual.  The delivery service was sort of unprofessional, in that the delivery guys effectively spoke no english, and refused to unbox the TV even though my girlfriend explained that they were supposed to, but the guy I called at the delivery company said they were contractors, offered to send them back out to pick up the packaging and apologized.

I didn't want to go with a plasma due to the constrained space and the heat they put out, so I was zeroing on the Sony LCDs until their new sets came out with the goofy glass trim around the sides that pushed their 42\" set past my available space. Looking at the rest of the field I considered the Sharp Aquos, but after seeing it and the Samsung set in person at a local bigbox store I decided that the color, contrast, and overall picture were just better on the Samsung.After something of a quest I ordered the Samsung LNT-4061F 40inch LCD HDTV on August 14th from Amazon. The set arrived via Eagle on August 22nd. The guy who delivered it did not seem to know much about the Amazon white glove service he was supposed to be part of - according to my wife he was more about getting his signature quickly and getting back on the road - but that was fine with me, as I wanted to do the unpacking.I also wanted to double check the serial number on the outside of the box. In my prepurchase research I discovered sets built before June have experienced an HDMI handshaking issue (thank you AVSFORUM) that Samsung is taking care of though their service organization, but I wanted to make sure my new set was outside that range - and it was: According to the SN coding, my new TV was built the end of July. The Samsung packing system is really excellent, and the set was perfect when I unpacked it.I hooked up my new Oppo upsampling DVD player via HDMI, my old AV receiver, and standard cable via coax that my old set was using, and turned on the set. After initial calibration (again, thanks AVSFORUMS) I scanned through my available signals and found all the standard def plus five local HD signals available on my existing cable service level, and I proceeded to be gobsmacked by the amazing picture on this great set. I have never been much of a sports fan, but I was mesmerized by the US Open coverage over HD broadcast - really just incredible. Whenever the networks put the effort into sending through a solid HD signal, this set makes the best of it. Switching over to an SD signal, the Samsung did a fine job with those as well.Then I fired up the DVD player. The Oppo uses a very high end upconverter chip, and once I got it set to output 1080p signal via HDMI, the quality of the upconversion really shone through on the Samsung. We had been watching the second season of Rome, so that disk happened to be in the player, and the picture just jumped out at us. The matte finish of the LCD screen makes this set relatively insensitive to ambient lighting, displaying the picture very well if window coverings are open or lights are on in the room.The Samsung remote is easy to figure out and to configure to control other equipment (though sadly not my Oppo DVD player), and the sound from the bottom-mounted built-in speakers is very clean, with dialog understandable even in noisier segments of movies.Overall I highly recommend the Samsung LNT-4061F.

I just wish I had some more HD channels via Comcast cable.  So far, I've found no issues with the picture quality at all.  The contrast is great, no problems with choppy picture (at least not from the TV).I find myself watching anything I can in HD, including now stuff I usually don't watch.  For example, not a hockey fan at all, but I've watched more hockey the last 3 weeks than I've ever watched in my life.  It's nice to be able to actually see the puck.  Flipped between that and the NCAA Women's College World Series (softball), which looked great in HD (but that's not just because of the picture quality ;-).  The Yankees aren't doing well, but even their losses look good in HD.  And now I have to go back and watch Discovery Channel's Planet Earth series again in HD.I think the SD quality isn't that bad in most cases.  That may be due to the cable box doing some up-conversion of the picture.  Most of the time, the SD sources just seem soft or slightly blurry, but that was expected.Bought a new up-converting DVD player, which helps the DVDs look fairly respectable.  Not ready to commit to an HD DVD format, yet.Amazon's sale price was good, and shipping was pain free with their free white-glove service.All in all, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a better quality LCD TV.

LCD vs. Plasma, 720p/1080i vs 1080p, Sony, Toshiba, Samsung, Sharp, etc...  I ended up deciding on this TV and after having it for a few weeks now I can categorically say I don't regret it.The picture quality is superb (after a little tuning of course), and it has inputs galore.  Right now I'm running an Xbox 360 (Component), an HD-DVR (HDMI), a laptop computer (VGA), and a PS2 (S-video).  I love that it upsamples all of the audio inputs and will output them over the digital optical cable (just stereo, not 5.1 unfortunately) so I can run a single wire down to my stereo receiver, since the speakers on the TV are a little on the weak side.Although there is very little content out there right now in \"full HD\" resolution, I decided to go with 1080p, primarily for future compatibility, and for better picture quality when connecting to my laptop or a HTPC in the near future.  It looks fantastic as a monitor, with clean, crisp lines and bright but not oversaturated colors.  I looked at this (LNT-4061) and another in the same line (LNT-4065).  The primary difference between the two is that the 4065 has a glossy panel and frame, while this one has a matte panel with a glossy frame.  I prefer the matte panel, since it reduces glare, but I suppose that part comes down to personal preference.Amazon was great, I bought it directly through them, not an authorized retailer, so I got free shipping, which was a nice benefit, since it would normally cost around $99.  Also, about 27 days after purchase, I noticed that it had been reduced in price, so I phoned Amazon, and they refunded me the difference of about $140... you can't beat that!As I mentioned before, there are a few minor quibbles I have with it.  The remote is sub-par, although it can technically be used as a universal remote, I don't think I'd want to.  Also, the speakers are fine, but nothing special, which isn't a problem for me since I turned on the internal mute and connected it to a real stereo receiver.  Also, black levels aren't as good as on a plasma display, but this is a problem with LCD panels in general, and this one is better than most, with no clouding in dark areas like in the previous generation (The LNS series).  Honestly, though, I'll take lighter blacks to plasma burn-in any day of the week, especially when using it as a monitor or to play games.Others have been complaining with bugs in the firmware related to HDMI and HDCP devices in particular, but I haven't experienced anything of this sort, so I can't comment for sure, but it seems like the kind of thing a firmware update would take care of.  As far as I can tell, updating said firmware is as simple as saving a few files to a USB flash drive and putting it into the USB port on the side of the TV.I'm still giving this TV 5 stars, however, since the annoyances are very minor, and since you simply get an amazing TV at an amazing price.  With the money you saved over the Sony TV (which uses the same image panel), you can buy a 5.1 audio system and/or a Logitech Harmony remote, eliminating the two main problems I have found with this display.", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV but...", "Author": "B.

For months, I used it for everything from video games, DVDs, HD programming, and I even used it as a computer monitor after I built a home-theater PC.If only the honeymoon would have lasted.Since March 2009, every once in a while the TV would refuse to start up immediately, instead it would click a few times, and when the picture finally appeared, there were pink pixels scattered everywhere. This could be remedied by turning off the TV and trying again. Then it got worse. The clicking would take longer and longer, and then instead of pink dots, there were multicolored lines. Finally, the TV refused to turn on anymore at all. Even having it plugged in results in endless clicks as the TV vainly attempts to turn itself on, each time with quick failure.After checking some forums, it would seem many of Samsung's recent TVs have this problem, due to bad soldering in the power-supply board. Eventually the solder, which is full of weak points, stops supplying a steady current to critical components, causing them to fail, one at a time until the whole unit is ruined. So I effectively paid $1500 for two years of enjoyment until the TV self-destructed.This kind of manufacturing flaw is generally cause for a recall, or at least a free replacement for the bad part. Unfortunately as the people in the forums will attest, Samsung is steadfastly ignoring the bad power boards, even under the threat of a class-action lawsuit. I personally take this as a bad sign, and will never purchase another Samsung product of any kind until the community agrees things have improved; it's just too risky to buy another TV which might die in two years. To contrast, the inexpensive JVC 32\" tube I bought in 2002 still works just fine.If not for the forums of people with the same exact complaint as mine, I would have called this a fluke--sometimes a bad TV makes it through the quality control, after all. This currently isn't the case; not only is the LNT4061 a risky investment, but even the newer 450s and 550s have the same problem.

I can't say enough good things about the picture.  Bright rich colors, deep sexy blacks, etc.  The only minor imperfection (that others have commented on) is the sound quality.  It has down firing speakers, so the sound doesn't really come out and grab you at all.

Then it began to click when powered on, and it would take minutes before displaying the picture.  The FAQ on Samsung's website says \"At certain times, it is normal for a TV to make a clicking sound, such as when you turn it on after a long period of inactivity...  If you hear a clicking sound and your TV is operating normally, there is nothing to be concerned about.\"  Now there are a few thin black vertical lines on the left of the screen, and the TV constantly cycles on and off.Searching the web, I found many owners complaining of similar problems with their Samsung LCD HDTV.  All having the problem appear 18 - 24 months after purchase.I'm very disappointed in the quality of this set.  Especially since the problem appears to be in the power supply.  This component should be very reliable over time.  My old Magnavox CRT TV gave me over 15 years of trouble free service!  Now I'm told I could pay $350.00 - 450.00 to have a Service Provider come to my home and repair it?!  That doesn't sit well with me after paying $1,300.00 for the TV.Initially, I highly recommended Samsung LCD HDTV's to many friends.  Now I must warn them to be on the lookout for this problem.For a little more than the cost of the repair, I can buy a new 42\" LG HDTV.

It really stands out in the demo room. Also the price range is so much more appealing than Sony's.However it needs some improvement for sure.1) The regular analog channels are almost unbearable to watch due to poor upconverting capability. Same thing happens to my dvd players (yes, I have 4 of them), I just can't stand the picture quality. I observed the picture quality on another brand, which is 720p, the resolution doesn't lose that much.2) This model has 3 picture mode, Dynamic, Standard and Movie. Dynamic is great for the sports but sometimes it gives this sort of white out feeling for the regular programs. Movie is way too dark comparing to the other two modes, the screen turns into this yellow milky color, the day light in movies looks like late afternoon (btw, I tried the combinations posted on the forum for movie mode, sorry, didn't work for me), so I think this mode is useless. Standard is probably the practical one.3) The source list selection (to choose TV, VCR, DVD, set box etc.) is a pain. My friend has a Bravia, he presses one button on remote to show all sources on the screen and pick one to switch. For this Samsung, I either have to press the source list button to go through all possible sources one by one sequentially or press menu->input->source list-> right key-> up or down key several times to pick the source I desire. Okay for me, but probably too difficult for mom and pa!4) The viewing angle is great, but the color is slightly off when not viewing it within 10 degrees or so.5) The built-in speaker is a joke. When I turn it up over 15, it sounds like the speaker is going to crack. Hooked up audio output to my receiver right away, but I feel sorry for people who don't have a stereo system.6) As mentioned in my review for Samsung BD-P1400 blu-ray player, the TV remote can not be programmed to control the blu-ray, which is a shame.Overall I think this is a decent LCD TV for first time buyers, but it could've been better in many ways.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV", "Author": "Jim St. John", "ReviewID": "R2J3VG9QSJQ7UA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung LNT4061 LCD TV is first class.

In any regard, I thought LCDs weren't prone to the burn-in issue, though after talking to the Samsung technician, I found this is not uncommon.I called Samesung and they had someone out to fix it.  First, Samsung came to my house and replaced the main circuit board (like a motherboard in a PC).  I had to argue with the technician that this hadn't fixed the issue.  He was trying to tell me the lines showing up on my widescreen movies and tv shows (where the 4:3 screen cut off on the widescreen), was acceptable wear AFTER 3 MONTHS!!!  For some reason the tech was really worried I was going to call Samsung again, so a week later, they replaced the screen.  This fixed the issue.  The technician told me to stretch the screen and watch things out of proportion for standard def and non-widescreen shows and movies or I'd experience the burn-in again.10 months later (15 days out of the one-year warranty), the on/off switch went haywire.  It was like trying to start an old car.  It kept clicking, and clicking.  After around 20-30 clicks, it would finally turn on.I called Samsung.  After much discussion, they basically told me \"too bad, so sad.\"  They would not put me through to a supervisor when I asked them to.

Well...after getting it, the remote does have a PIP button, however, what I found out is that the TV has only one tuner and the PIP system takes two tuners to operate. So, to use it you have to be watching a TV show and having your VCR/DVD (using it's tuner) on to bring up the second channel. Even then you can't switch from one channel of the PIP screen to the other. I would not have purchased this TV if I had known that.

May 30, 2007. (not available for download)Latest known mainboard firmware: 1009.Update: July 5, 2007The HDMI crisis is now \"officially\" over. If you are STILL having HDMI issues as described in this post, you MUST get in contact with Samsung , options, 4, 1, 1, and get a BOARD replacement for your set. For the most part, new LN-T TVs are shipping with 1008 mainboards or HIGHER, which should resolve the problem. If you are still having issues with 1008 boards, get it replaced (again). Apparently some boards can be finicky.More and more people are getting board replacements that are fixing the HDMI issue, so I feel it's fair to call the crisis over.Update: July 5, 2007I can report that I had my main-board replaced (1004 board, with 1024 firmware) with a 1005 board with 1022 firmware. I'm happy to report that for me, my HDMI issues are now gone after several weeks of use with zero flashes/drops etc.HOWEVER, it is still VERY possible to have a 1005 board with HDMI issues. The current official fix from Samsung is a 1008 board, with 1024-or-higher firmware. There ARE several people who claim to have issues with 1008/1024 combinations, but I firmly believe another replacement is therefore needed. I also firmly believe there are 1008/1024 problematic boards out there, and 1008/1024 working boards. So hang in there folks!(The bottom of this post explains the above numbers for the new people around these parts!)Update: June 23, 2007As fellow board member Sam Relishe has noticed, after a mainboard swap some of the settings might be wrong. I own an LN-T4661, and my replaced mainboard was set up for a LN-T4665. This meant the color palette was completely wrong (everything was red and orange and green), and I had a menu option to turn the blue light on and off (only the LN-T4x65 series has the blue light). The way to fix this is as follows:(Make sure to make a note of your picture calibration settings, as mine were reset after going into the service menu)With your TV off, press MUTE, 1, 8, 2, and then POWERThen, choose the OPTION BYTE.IMPORTANT: DO NOT MESS WITH ANY OTHER SETTINGS THAN THE ONES LISTED:Make sure the SCREEN SIZE is correct: Panel Option = 46AMW for LN-T4665 displays, and 46AM for LN-T4661 displays.Make sure that if you own an LN-T4x65 that your Lvds Tx Bit = 10bit.Make sure if you own an LN-T4x61 that your Lvds Tx Bit = 8bit.If you own an LN-T4x65, your should change your model so it says \"Tulip Side.\"If you own an LN-T4x61, you should change the model so it says \"Tulip.\"After changing these options, turn your TV off, and then on.Update: June 22, 2007One of our fellow AVS members, axmode, came across a way to check what firmware version you'll get, before you open the box! This might be a smart way to check before you buy the TV.To check what firmware version you haveThe 8th character in your S/N (pertinent to all 2007 LN-Txx6x models) is a letter P which stands for 2007. The 9th character which follows that letter P will be a number which denotes the months of assembly. For those of you who want to ensure having a 1024/1008 at the very least, that number should be a 6 at the very least (to be sure).Axmode verified this with his own S/Ns and the 4665 which went back was a P4 (1016/1004). The current 4061 is a P5 (1024/1008). This info may help those of you who are considering a purchase through a big box store, prior to opening up the sets.Thanks axmode!Update: June 21, 2007As of June Wednesday, June 20th, Tier 2 representatives at Samsung tech support have stated that the fix for ALL HDMI issues is a board replacement for those that do NOT have 1008 main boards with 1024 firmware. See the bottom of this post for instructions on how to check your version. Until we have confirmation from more people that this is the fix, this remains only SPECULATION on the part of the skeptical consumer. However, this is official and has been confirmed as the \"fix\" by several Tier 2 specialists.Update: June 18, 2007. Fellow forum member dkwong has compiled a spreadsheet so we can keep track of who has what TV, and what firmware information and issues they are having. Thanks dkwong!PLEASE send him any information you can so he can update his spreadsheet. You can view it here:Samsung SpreadsheetUpdate: June 15, 2007. 1028 is the latest firmware, with no confirmation of the HDMI issue being fixed.Update: June 1, 2007. How to use an XBOX 360 with the VGA cable, to resolve the \"Mode Not Supported\" message:1. Reset the resolution of the console to 640x480. To do this, start the console, hold both triggers, and then press and hold the Y button as the console starts.2. If this resolves the issue and you receive a picture on the display, you can continue to use the 640x480 resolution. Or you can try to use a higher resolution setting. If this does not resolve the issue, continue to the next step.3. Disconnect the VGA HD cable from the display, and then remove the console power cord from the power outlet.4. Wait five seconds.5. Reconnect the console power cord to the power outlet, and then turn on the console.6. Reconnect the VGA HD cable to the display. If this resolves the issue and you receive a picture on the display, you can continue to use the 640x480 resolution. Or you can try to use a higher resolution setting.1.) The entire 2007 Samsung 1080p LCD lineup is suffering from HDMI handshake issues. This is the LN-Txxxx line. This is not just video-game related, but reported units giving trouble include the Playstation 3, XBOX 360 Elite, HTPCs, and various STBs. Also reports from people with drops/flashes:\"Mac Mini (Intel); PowerMac G4 DP (with a Radeon 9xxx(?) video card); Denon 2910 - upscaling (1080i) DVD Playler (this a pure HDMI connection)\" - (courtesy of Ted Todorov)1.b.) These issues manifest themselves as dropouts (picture loss), momentary green or pink flashes etc. These may not happen for hours and hours, and then suddenly you can get hit with two or three flashes/dropouts in a short time. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the issue.2.) Several tech people from Tier 1 and Tier 2 support said that Samsung ARE aware of the issue and are working to fix it. There is currently NO fix available.3.) Design issues:There are numerous reports of what is known as \"clouding\" or \"mura.\" Nobody knows exactly what causes this, but it manifests itself as blotches of lighter areas on the screen or in the corners (corners are also known as \"flashlights\").There are several reports of people wiping the area with a cloth from the cloud to the edge of the screen to remove the issue, but I can't verify this. To do this, grab a dry cloth and wipe the cloud fairly gently. If it moves, keep moving it!Please refrain from asking questions about clouds, as this post should cover it. I personally understand the frustration of having had really bad clouds, but it bogs down the thread to discuss it ad nauseam. If you can't clear the clouds, and they actually bother you, exchange your set at your vendor. It is possible to get a completely cloud-free set, but don't drive yourself crazy. If you can't notice them during \"normal\" viewing, you've nothing to worry about!3.b.) Another issue affecting these sets is something known as \"pillaring.\" I personally haven't seen pillaring but it is visible as bands of light on the left and right of the screen. Apparently this can be fixed by properly calibrating your set: i.e. turning down brightness/contrast/backlight to NORMAL levels. If you have this problem, adjust your settings. If this doesn't fix it, return the set to your vendor. At this point, I believe it's simply calibration issues.4.) Some forum members are recommending HDMI port savers to take the strain off their TV's HDMI ports from the heavy cable connecting to your devices. Some have even said it fixed the handshaking issues they've been having but this is NOT proven as of yet (I can say they didn't help for me at all). You plug the port saver into your TV, and then your actual HDMI cable into it. I can speak only for myself when I say that port savers did NOT fix the handshaking issue.To check your firmware version, here are the instructions:1. Turn on your TV.2. Press the MENU button on your remote.3. Select SETUP, and then press ENTER.4. Select Function Help, and then press ENTER.5. Use the Up or Down arrow button on your remote to move down to Function Help to ON, and then press the ENTER button.6. With Function Help ON highlighted (don't actually push ENTER on it), press the INFO button on the remote. Your firmware revision will be listed as two lines of information. The TOP line is your software firmware. The BOTTOM line is the hardware revision number.So, I have 1024 firmware (software), and 1004 hardware (mainboard).If I haven't had any problems should I bother trying to get samsung to upgrade my board/firmware from 1008/1028 to 1009/1029?The only reason to change would be if the 1009/1029s had somehting the 08s were lacking. Ie when CNET tested the 61/65 both failed 2 of their 1080i tests and introduced anomalies with certain scenes of movies. Samsung contacted them after and said they had fixed this in a new firmware, they didnt specify which one but if that fix is in the 09/29 and not the 8/28 then thats a reason to switch.\"It also behaves exactly the same as the 65F in our resolution tests--failing to resolve every detail of a 1080i test pattern, for example, and failing both of the Geek Box 1080i deinterlacing tests (although it passed the video test when in \"16:9\" as opposed to \"Just Scan\" mode) from the HQV HD DVD and Blu-ray discs. We didn't see any evidence of those failures in Apes, but we did find a scene in Ghost Rider, where the grille of the RV at the end of Chapter 6 evinced some diagonal moir\u00e9 along its horizontal grille. We don't consider failure at deinterlacing a deal-breaker for HDTV picture quality, although if you have access to 1080p content, we recommend choosing it to avoid the chance of seeing these sorts of artifacts.For what it's worth, Samsung sent us a firmware update that worked with both sets to fix the deinterlacing of video-based, but not film-based, 1080i content and to show every line of a 1080-resolution test pattern. \"Samsung LN-T4661FAt a glance* Release date: April 1, 2007* Editors' rating: 7.9 Very good* The good: Flat-panel LCD HDTV produces deep black levels; accurate color after adjustment; clean image; numerous picture controls; beautiful styling.* The bad: Less shadow detail than some LCDs and plasmas; image discolors somewhat when seen from off-angle.* The bottom line: Although not quite the best of its breed, the Samsung LN-T4661F delivers very good picture quality with plenty of style and functionality.The LN-T4661F is Samsung's least-expensive 46-inch flat-panel LCD with 1080p native resolution for the 2007 model year. We recently reviewed another 46-inch 1080p LCD HDTV from Samsung, model LN-T4665F, so you may be wondering why we chose to review this one so soon afterward. The answer is shine. We complained about the 65F's shiny screen because it reflected lots of ambient light, acting more like a mirror than any TV screen we'd seen yet. The 61F's screen has the standard matte finish, which really cuts down on glare. But between the two, we did feel the LN-T4665F offered slightly better picture quality despite the shine (more on that below), making it a better choice for real home theater buffs and others with a lot of control over room lighting. On the other hand, the LN-T4661F should satisfy people who just can't stomach glare, and its picture quality, feature set and exterior design are still a cut above most LCDs on the market.DesignWe really liked the futuristic look of the Samsung LN-T4661F. While both Samsung LCDs, along with most other HDTVs from all kinds of manufacturers lately, are clad entirely in glossy black, the LN-T4661F has a few different styling cues of its own. The speakers hide on the bottom, as opposed to the sides, and sound is deflected into the room by a narrow lip that runs along the bottom of the frame. The swivel base, which allows the panel to move about 20 degrees to either side, is oval instead of rectangular. And fans of the company's prominent circular power button will be thrilled to see it's back in full effect here.Including the stand, the LN-T4665H measures 43.6 inches wide by 30.2 inches high by 12.8 inches deep. Without it, the panel measures 43.6 inches wide by 23.8 inches high by 4.1 inches deep.Samsung's remote is almost the same as last year, and we generally found the slender wand easy to operate. Only the keys for volume, channel, and device control (the universal clicker can command four other pieces of gear) are illuminated, but that's better than most TV remotes, which skip backlighting altogether. All of the buttons are nicely separated and differentiated, with the exception of the secondary controls clustered at the clicker's base, which kind of blend together. We'd like to see dedicated buttons for each input, although since the set automatically senses and skips inactive inputs, cycling between sources is less arduous than usual.FeaturesReaders of the LN-T4665F review will experience some deja vu when reading the below because the two reviews' Features sections, like the two TVs' feature sets, are basically identical.With a native resolution of 1,920x1,080 pixels, popularly known as \"1080p,\" the Samsung LN-T4661F has enough pixels to resolve every detail of 1080i and 1080p HDTV sources, although it falls a bit short in real life (see Performance for more). All other sources, including 720p HDTV, DVD, computer, and standard-def, are scaled to fit the pixels.The LN-T4661F includes HDMI 1.3-compatible inputs, which have higher bandwidth than the older versions. In itself that doesn't mean much, but it does enable the LN-T4661F to offer a menu selection labeled \"xvYCC,\" which refers to a wider color space that supposedly comes closer to human vision's capabilities than the current HDTV color space. Of course, you'll need an HDMI 1.3-compatible source (the player and disc, for example), and as far as we know, there isn't any xvYCC content available. In other words, we classify xvYCC and HDMI 1.3 inputs, at least as implemented on the LN-T4661F, as \"no big deal.\" The set's spec sheet also mentions 10-bit processing, but when we asked Samsung, they said that the panel itself doesn't deliver 10-bit color--just that the processing is capable of it. Extra bit depth can allow less false contouring, among other issues, but again, it requires a 10-bit source and display.Segueing to features that actually matter, the LN-T4661F has an excellent selection of picture controls. It offers three picture modes that are each independent for each input, allowing you to customize each source with three different groups of picture settings. Only Movie mode allows full adjustment, however, so we recommend using it for the most demanding viewing conditions. In addition to the standard brightness, contrast, etc., sliders, there's a full-fledged backlight control, which is also independent per input.In addition to the five presets for color temperature, there's a full set of detailed color temperature controls. Labeled \"white balance,\" they offer both gain and offset adjustments for red, green, and blue, which allows slightly more advanced users to really zero in the set's grayscale. The My Color control, on the other hand, doesn't seem to do much of anything, so we left it in the default positions. The selection of secondary picture controls includes items labeled \"black level,\" which affects shadow detail; dynamic contrast, which adjusts black level on the fly; gamma, which affects the rate of progression from dark to light; and a selection for color gamut, which controls the range of colors the display can reproduce.We appreciated the solid selection of aspect-ratio controls, which include four choices for HD sources. Just Scan is the mode best suited for 1080i and 1080p sources, because it introduces no overscan and displays the image with no scaling. Standard-def sources allow four choices as well, including two zoom modes you can adjust vertically, to see subtitles or obscure tickers, for example.The back panel includes the usual array of jacks.Like more and more 2007 HDTVs, the Samsung LN-T4661F offers three HDMI inputs as opposed to just two. Two are located on the back, while a third can be found in a recessed bay along the panel's left side. The Samsung's commendable connectivity continues with a pair of component-video inputs, an AV input with S-Video, two RF inputs for cable and antenna, and a VGA-style RGB input for computers (maximum resolution 1,920x1,080). That recessed bay offers an additional AV input with S-Video as well as a USB port that can interface with thumbdrives to display photos (JPEG only) and play music (MP3 only). Software upgrades can also be applied via the USB port.The side panel offers a USB port for music, photos, and firmware updates.PerformanceOverall, the Samsung LN-T4661F came close to the picture quality of its slightly more expensive brother, the LN-T4665F, but the latter earned a better performance score for a couple of reasons. The first is its superior detail in shadows, and the second is its significantly better off-axis viewing characteristics. In most other aspects of picture quality, including depth of black, resolution, color accuracy and saturation, the two were very similar. If you're more of a home theater stickler who turns off the lights for movies and can control your room's ambient light in most other situations, then the shiny-screened 65F gets the nod. But if you're stuck with a bright room or simply don't want to contend with the glare from the 65F's screen, the 61F makes a solid choice.During setup, as usual, we adjusted the picture settings to levels ideal for our darkened theater. We chose the Gamma -2 mode because it seemed to provide the best balance between preserving shadow detail and delivering a smooth, realistic rise out of black. We'd have liked to go with -3 mode, as we did with the 65F, but that ended up obscuring too much shadow detail. After reducing light output to around 40 ftl, we used the extensive color temperature fine-tuning controls to improve quite a bit upon the Warm2 preset (see the Geek Box below). For a complete look at our user-menu picture settings, click here or check out the Tips & Tricks section above.For this review, we set up the LN-T4661F next to a few other HDTVs we had on hand, including its aforementioned \"shiny\" step-up brother, the LN-T4665F, along with the Sony KDL-46S3000, the Panasonic TH-42PZ700U, and the Pioneer PRO-FHD1.We began, as usual, with a good look at the LN-T4661F's black-level performance, and the set did not disappoint. We had it right next to the LN-T4665F and, despite Samsung's \"true black\" advertising (which pertains to the 65F and not the 61F), after calibration it was often difficult to tell which one displayed a deeper color of black. Our measurements told us it was the 65F by a hair, but that set did have slightly brighter edges compared to the middle, making the 61F appear darker in certain scenes, especially predominantly dark ones like the void of space in the beginning of Planet of the Apes. For the record, both Samsung LCDs and the Panasonic plasma evinced about the same level of black, while the Sony LCD and the Pioneer plasma appeared visibly lighter.When calibrating the TVs in our comparisons we adjust the relavant controls to achieve the best combination of black level and shadow detail. In the case of the 61F, we felt this combination was best achieved by sacrificing some detail in shadows to get the blacks deeper -- a compromise we didn't have to make with the 65F. The effect of that compromise with the 61F was the most-visible difference between the two sets. When Mark Wahlberg's ship first crashes on the planet, for example, we could see less of the leaves under the darkest parts of the jungle foliage on the 61F. Gradations from light to shadow, which were evident in the hallway of shadowed plant husks outside the ape city, also appeared a bit more realistic on the 65F and the plasmas. The 61F's shadow detail was still a cut above that of most LCDs however, including the Sony.The LN-T4661F has accurate primary colors in common with its shinier brother, and other areas of color accuracy, including grayscale performance, were very similar. After calibration the 61F, like the 65F, evinced a grayscale that tended to redden dark areas of the image. This issue was evident, for example, when Walhberg's face and, especially, his dark hair appeared a bit redder than on our reference Pioneer plasma after he's thrown to the ground during the apes' dinner and looks back at his tormentor. Overall, however, colors were still quite well-saturated and vibrant, from the green of the jungle plants to the apes' various skin tones to the red cushions and tapestries in the main ape's bedchamber. Even with its less-accurate grayscale, the LN-T4661F's color accuracy is among the best we've seen from a flat-panel LCD.As we expected, the Samsung also delivered a very clean image. We didn't notice any false contouring during the film, even in tough areas like the sunlight in the misty jungle that showed slight contours on the Panasonic plasma. Video noise, even in skies and shadows, was also not a noticeable issue.Although Apes appears a bit softer than many Blu-ray titles, it still packs plenty of detail, which the LN-T4661F conveyed faithfully. We enjoyed the weave in the carpet under the card-playing soldiers, for example, and the individual golden strands of Estella Warren's hair during a close-up. It also behaves exactly the same as the 65F in our resolution tests--failing to resolve every detail of a 1080i test pattern, for example, and failing both of the Geek Box 1080i deinterlacing tests (although it passed the video test when in \"16:9\" as opposed to \"Just Scan\" mode) from the HQV HD DVD and Blu-ray discs. We didn't see any evidence of those failures in Apes, but we did find a scene in Ghost Rider, where the grille of the RV at the end of Chapter 6 evinced some diagonal moir\u00e9 along its horizontal grille. We don't consider failure at deinterlacing a deal-breaker for HDTV picture quality, although if you have access to 1080p content, we recommend choosing it to avoid the chance of seeing these sorts of artifacts.For what it's worth, Samsung sent us a firmware update that worked with both sets to fix the deinterlacing of video-based, but not film-based, 1080i content and to show every line of a 1080-resolution test pattern. (This update is not reflected in our Geek Box results.) Update 06-20-07: We originally reported here that the firmware update would be available as a download from Samsung's web site. Now we hear from the company that the update may instead only be available to owners who call the Service Center and ask to have it sent. We'll update this section again when we're told more. New TVs equipped with the updated firmware will arrive on store shelves, according to Samsung, by mid- to late July 2007.Flat-panel LCDs often display imperfect uniformity across the screen, although the LN-T4661F was better than most in this regard. We've mentioned that the screen of the 65F appears brighter along the edges than the middle, especially in darker areas. The 61F does as well, but the difference is quite a bit smaller, and its rightmost edge is the only area that was visibly brighter in black fields, such as the shots of the orbiting space station from the beginning of the film. In dark gray test patterns (15-20 IRE fields), we did notice a very slightly brighter area across the screen's middle as well, but it wasn't apparent in any program material we watched.One area where the LN-T4661F falls a good deal short of its shiny cousin is in off-axis viewing. All LCDs, including the 65F, wash out a good deal when viewed from somewhere farther than a seat or two away from the sweet spot right in the center of the screen, but the 61F (along with the Sony) also acquired a slight reddish tinge when seen from off-angle to either side, an issue the 65F does not have. The washed-out blacks and red coloration became more apparent the farther we moved off-axis.On the flip side, the LN-T4661F's matte screen reflected far less ambient light than the shiny screen of the 65F. With the room lights turned up, the 61F actually delivered a darker apparent color of black, and of course, we didn't see nearly as much of the room--including a watcher's white shirt or the coffee table in front of the TVs.When we checked out the HP-T4661F's standard-def picture quality, using the HQV disc at 480i resolution via component video, the set performed exactly the same as the 65F--which is about average. According to the color bars pattern, the set resolved every detail of the DVD format, and the grass and bricks of the detail test were relatively sharp. On the other hand, it allowed many moving diagonal lines, such as the stripes on a waving American flag, to appear more jagged than we like to see. The four noise-reduction settings did a progressively better job of removing random motes of snowy noise from the disc's low-quality sunsets and shots of skies, but as usual, there was a trade-off, and details were softened somewhat as we increased NR. The Auto setting didn't really work well to automatically adjust the NR, especially in the \"motion-adaptive\" scenes with the roller coaster, so we recommend choosing one of the manual modes when you'd like to fight the noise. The LN-T4661F did engage 2:3 pull-down quickly and accurately.As a PC monitor via the VGA input, the LN-T4661F performed exactly as its 65F counterpart. According to DisplayMate test patterns, the set resolved every line of vertical resolution and nearly every line of horizontal resolution with our video card set to 1,920x1,080 output. We detected a slight bit of softness in PC text at font sizes smaller than 10-point, but it certainly wasn't overt. The desktop filled the screen perfectly, and overall, we think most viewers will be happy with its capabilities as a big computer display.Geek boxTEST RESULT SCOREBefore color temp (20/80) 7006/7088K AverageAfter color temp 6398/6490K GoodBefore grayscale variation +/- 623K AverageAfter grayscale variation +/- 126K AverageColor of red (x/y) 0.641/0.327 GoodColor of green 0.296/0.578 GoodColor of blue 0.149/0.068 GoodOverscan 0% GoodBlack-level retention All patterns stable GoodDefeatable edge enhancement Y Good480i 2:3 pull-down, 24 fps Y Good1080i video resolution Fail Poor1080i film resolution Fail PoorSamsung LCDs promise six-figure contrastIn addition to the Samsung LCDs detailed here, the company is introducing two more expensive series of LCDs in August 2007. The new sets incorporate step-up features designed to improve picture quality: 120Hz refresh rates and, in the most expensive series, LED backlights said to boost contrast ratios beyond anything seen before. We haven't reviewed any of the new models yet, but we can give you information on how their specs stack up. When we do get one of these televisions in for review, we'll update this information.Samsung LN-T71F seriesThe big step-up feature for this series is a 120Hz refresh rate, which is said to cut down on the motion blur sometimes seen by sharp-eyed viewers in fast-moving scenes. Again, we haven't tested this feature yet, and it's not exclusive to Samsung (Sony and Toshiba, among others, have 120Hz LCDs out this year), but it might be worth the extra cash over the step-down 65F and 61F series to some discerning viewers. Compared to the 65F series, the 71F series also boasts a higher contrast ratio, which might mean better black-level performance, but we doubt if the improvement is all that noticeable despite the very high 25,000:1 spec. Styling is also a bit different, too, incorporating chrome plating to accent the standard glossy black. Of course, these models include the same shiny screen we complained about in the LN-T4665F review, which Samsung calls \"Super clear panel.\"Models (estimated selling prices)* Samsung LN-T4071F (2 699)* Samsung LN-T4671F (3 399)* Samsung LN-T5271F (4 399)Step-up features (over the LN-T65F series)* 120Hz refresh rate* 25,000:1 contrast ratio* chrome platingSamsung LN-T81F seriesSamsung LN-T81F seriesSamsung LN-T81F series(Credit: Samsung)Samsung's highest-end LCD-based HDTVs for 2007, the LN-T81F series, includes the first widely distributed flat-panel LCDs that replace the traditional fluorescent backlight (the TV's light source) with LED technology. The benefits, according to Samsung, include more-accurate color and better black-level performance, to the extent that the company is claiming a 100,000:1 contrast ratio, the highest yet for a shipping flat-panel set. The TVs are said to achieve these deep black levels because the dark areas of the display can be turned off completely--traditional LCD backlights are always on, which causes \"black\" areas of the picture to brighten a bit as the light leaks through--with so-called local dimming technology. All this pretty-sounding technology costs a pretty penny compared to the 71F series (from $300 to $600 extra depending on screen size), but it has the potential to really improve picture quality. Needless to say, we're excited to review one of the 81F series and check out the claims for ourselves. Aside from the LED backlight, the LN-T81F series is pretty much identical to the 71F series in terms of specs and includes the same shiny screen.Models (estimated selling prices)* Samsung LN-T4081F (2 999)* Samsung LN-T4681F (3 999)* Samsung LN-T5281F (4 999)* Samsung LN-T5781F (6 999)Step-up features* LED backlight* local dimming* 100,000:1 contrast ratio", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Have some issues.

I switch off the TV and when I powered it back again, eveything was fine.I saw one review that seem to have a similar issue when the signal source is switched from one source to another. I'm hoping this is just a minor flaw, but obviously I cannot give it a 5 star.Update (Sept. 2012) - What can I say, after owning it and moving more than 6k miles, it still works just as good as when it first arrived. Important note: about 2 years ago - the TV started taking more than a minute to start and had purple dots all over the TV screen.

Y. \"Photographer | Outdoor Enthusiast ...", "ReviewID": "R1YUPXQBXX7XQS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this in July 2007.There are some really good reviews of this TV already, and I will add to them my own good (and bad) experiences.PROS: Excellent picture quality. Plenty of input sources, including VGA (for computers/laptops.) Sexy design and good value.CONS: Some minor design issues. Remote control is laggy.SUMMARY: You can't go wrong with this unit. I like it a lot.DETAILED REVIEW:Like Phil, I also had in mind to use this TV for all my multimedia needs: computer, Playstation 2 Slim, Over-the-Air (OTA) HD TV, and of course, movies. I live in a 2-bedroom apartment and didn't want anything less than 1080p. I also do not subscribe to cable or satellite TV due to the fact that I do not (yet) see the necessity to pay $50/month for something I don't really use.The television brands I was primarily considering were the Sharp Aquos and Samsung units. I settled for this TV due to the number of input options, good value (price), and sexy looks. I chose LCD over Plasma because of what I intended to primarily use the TV for: computer use, gaming, and lower chances of picture \"burn-ins\" that older-generation Plasma is known for.Keep in mind that this review is written with the TV brightness set at 70%, as running it at 100% would shorten the lifespan of the LCD. At full 100% brightness, the television definitely is a stunner! The unit has also been configured to detect changes in room lighting and automatically adjust the brightness accordingly.COMPUTER USE:This is what I use this unit for primarily. Excellent image quality despite connecting a 1920x1080 resolution laptop to the Samsung with a regular VGA-to-VGA cable. My next laptop will likely have a DVI video port -- when that happens, I definitely recommend a DVI-to-HDMI cable. Text is sharp and images are bright and vivid. Playing recorded HD television programs is bliss, and playing BBC's/Discovery Channel's Planet Earth mini-series at 780p has blown away the mind of every single person who wanted to see what this TV is capable of. My laptop could not smoothly handle the 1080p version, but that has nothing to do with the TV.Computer games looked excellent and no blurring was noticeable. Games included Command and Conquer: Tiberium Wars, Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault, Need for Speed: Carbon, and many more.I agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned how amazingly bad DVD movies look when compared to today's available HD programs. But again, this has nothing to do with this TV at all as DVD video is becoming an outdated standard. The DVD movies were played through the laptop with no upscaling whatsoever. Blu-Ray simply looks amazing on this unit when my friend fired up his Playstation 3 with a Blu-Ray movie! The same can be said about HD-DVD when my brother hooked up his Xbox360 and a HD-DVD movie.PHOTOGRAPHY USE:When viewing my images, they look absolutely amazing! I am a hobbyist photographer (with ambitions to go pro) with a Canon EOS 30D digital SLR (see some examples of these images posted on Amazon.com by searching for the Canon 30D and going through the customer-supplied photos. The camera itself is astonishing.)Friends and family marvel at how sharp and vibrant the photos look on this set.PLAYSTATION 2 SLIM USE:Picture quality was horrible when connecting the PS2Slim to the TV set with the included PS2 RCA cables. I read that buying the optional PS2 S-Video cable would improve picture quality, and so I went out to get one. It sure did help, but the games still look bad (but playable.) Suffice to say, the PS2 was never designed for HD. Get the PS3 or Xbox360 instead.OVER-THE-AIR TELEVISION USE:There wasn't true 1080p content available for me to receive over the air. The closest was 1080i, and although most people said that it looked amazing, I'm a picky computer professional when it comes to picture quality. Nonetheless, it definitely played analog broadcast channels better than my dad's Philips set. Those channels that I am able to receive (mostly 720p) looks pretty stunning.One qualm I have about this unit is that it doesn't seem to have an auto-resize functionality that would turn everything into widescreen. The manual recommends that full-screen content not be played for too long on ANY television set (not just this Samsung), as the difference between the actual video content and the black bars on the side may become a problem over time. You can force any video (except for the computer feed) into widescreen by using the included remote. I like how my dad's Philips unit resizes everything into widescreen, though I don't like how fullscreen content looks stretched when forced to widescreen.Personally, I leave fullscreen content at fullscreen and take my chances. I did not know that LCDs could have \"burn-in\" problems, but hey, never say never.MOVIE USE:Video quality looks STUNNING. The blacks are, of course, not as black as Plasma televisions, but it's really not that noticeable. There's no noticeable ghosting and action sequences look quite good. Colors are vibrant. I watch my movies with the lights on.SOUND:The built-in speakers are not bad, but when compared to the THX-certified Logitech Z-5500 Digital speakers I use with my computer, it's like comparing a Honda with a BMW. I like both car makers. I have hooked up the television unit to the Logitech speakers with an optical audio cable, and you can definitely notice the difference in optical vs standard RCA-type cables. Surround sound comes from the right places, and some of the television shows actually provide engaging surround sound! The problem with optical cables is that audio is always sent at full volume to the speakers. So, you'll have to control the sound volume with the speaker remote instead.The unit boasts a feature that would auto-level sound coming from each TV channel so that while you're flipping through the channels, the difference in volumes of those channels would not be so noticeable. In other words, as you're flipping through a more silent channel to a loud one, the loud one should automatically be adjusted by the TV to match the quieter one. I was not able to get this feature to work even though it's turned on in the setup. Perhaps it's because I'm having the sound go through the optical audio cables. Remember, optical cables always sent the full volume to the speakers. I haven't had a chance to try it without the optical audio cable yet. I like optical audio too much to let go of it :-)VISUAL DESIGN OF THE TV:It's sexy and gets compliments from everyone who has seen it. The glossy piano finish definitely gives it a high-class edge. I chose not to buy the 4065F model because the 4061F one does a better job of minimizing glare. The television does work like a dust magnet. Dust collects easily as another reviewer pointed out. Keep your feather duster handy for once-every-2-week use.The swivel base is nice. It allows you to turn the TV into a desired position.MISC:- This unit allows you to label the various input sources so that when you switch between them, it shows what you're looking at. It does not, however, allow you to completely customize the names of the predefined labels.- There's a feature in the setup that shows you the signal strength of the TV source. This has helped me optimally position my antenna.- The remote control doesn't feel as nice as it looks, and pushing the buttons shows noticeable lag between then they were pushed and when the TV responds. Somebody else pointed out this minor flaw too.- Another reviewer also pointed out that there is a lag between the power button is pushed and when the display shows something. He/she shared that his/her mother kept turning on/off the TV while thinking that it wasn't working. Indeed there is such a lag while the television \"readies\" itself. You can tell whether the TV is responding or not by looking at the red LED of the power button: when you push to turn on the set, it starts blinking, followed by a sound after a couple seconds. When you turn off the set, a sound is played to indicate that it has been turned off. This lag is true with most LCDs, however, including computer LCDs.I do wish that instead of utilizing a blinking status indicator that the TV is turning on, that they would transition the solid red (off) into solid blue (on), for example. I think the 4065F model does that.All said and done, I highly recommend this television and would give it 5 stars if it weren't for some of the minor design issues.----------------EDIT 11/7/2007: TV's still functioning beautifully and I am still very happy with the purchase.EDIT 2/22/2012: TV is still working great!", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "How to fix the power supply and save a bundle", "Author": "Injunohc", "ReviewID": "R3ISDC79NAA55Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My TV started to turn on very slowly and have no usable picture if it turned on quickly. When it did start with any sort of a usable picture, the screen was peppered with magenta and cyan dots. Very crappy.It turns out the power supply has an inherent flaw that needs to be fixed. This will cost you 6 dollars if you have some basic electronics stuff like a good soldering iron and desoldering braid.  If you don't know how to solder, this is probably a bad project to learn on, unless you have a good teacher on hand.Remove the screws from the back of the TV, then slide the back off. Unhook all the connectors from the power supply board, then remove the 7 screws holding it in. The power supply board is the one in the center of the back of the TV. It has a bunch of capacitors and several heat sinks on it.There are 4 capacitors on the power supply board that are rated 1000 uf at 10V. 10V is obviously not enough, as they get unhappy quickly and start to swell as they fail. Curiously enough, there is another 1000 uf cap on the board that's rated 25V. I replaced the 4 with 25V (radial lead) electrolytic caps. They are the same diameter as the old parts, but a little taller, which doesn't matter.The old caps are recognizable by their markings, as detailed above, but also by the top of the can, which will have a slight dome shape instead of being flat. When you get them out, you'll notice the rubber plug in the bottom is about to blow out. Make sure to replace all of these caps, even if they don't look swollen.All of these caps (old and new) are marked with a band down the side with minuses on it. This is (obviously) the minus lead of the cap. Note that the new caps also have a long lead, this is the positive lead. Mark the component side of the board with a permanent marker on the minus side of the cap. The other side of the board has \"+\" markings on it, and I like to put marks on it so I desolder the correct pads. Getting the polarity wrong would not be a good mistake to make.Put the end of the desolder braid on the pad, add some solder to the hot iron tip and press it against the braid until the solder stops wicking up it. Most of the hole in the pad should be free of solder, if not, cut off the solder-filled part of the wick and repeat. Use the tip of the iron to heat up the capacitor lead in the desoldered hole. Once the remaining solder melts, straighten the lead by pushing on it with the tip. You should be able to remove the cap by pulling on it once both leads are desoldered and straightened.Push the new cap through the board, noting the minus band and long lead to confirm polarity. Once you're satisfied the polarity is correct, bend the leads out very close to the board. This will keep the cap in place as you invert the board for soldering. 67-33 rosin core tin lead solder works very well. Don't use 60-40 or 50-50, as the joint will not be as good. Clean the tip, tin it with solder and apply the tinned edge to the lead and pad. Add solder until you have a nice, smooth fillet. Once both leads are soldered, cut them off flush with the solder fillet. Repeat for the other 3 caps. Reinstall the board and reassemble the TV. You will certainly enjoy the results.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Planned Obsolescence", "Author": "Donna Didomenico \"Donna\"", "ReviewID": "R17PT01AHKTCDL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this just when it came out and the TV was pretty good while it was under its warranty.

Amazon had by far the lowest price on the 4061 (roughly $600 less than Best Buy.) I was monitoring price fluctuations for this LCD and a few others like it for about 5 months until Christmas when I bought the Samsung, and I found that Amazon has the best deals @ Xmas and the few days that follow. The 4061 has an impeccable picture with 720p and 1080i/p resolutions. As mentioned in other reviews, the factory picture settings are skewed in many different categories; however, all of these settings are completely adjustable. To extend the life of the TV and to increase picture quality overall, I keep every picture setting on 50, except for contrast at 55 and backlight at 5,6,or 7. For Blu-ray movie's I turn up the contrast to 75 to show a more full range of color.I use the 4061 almost exclusively for PS3/Blu-ray movies, and an occasional HD program (e.g. football game.) The picture for standard DVDs and PS2 games look great using the PS3's upscaler. The picture for standard TV programs (480i) is good, definitely one of the best for LCDs in the 4061's class.The one tiny problem is that I notice a tad bit of motion blur at times. This is most likely a setting that is changeable, and could be caused by the DNIe, which can be disabled.

While this review may not be extensive, it is just my intial impression of the Samsung and the purchase process.My initial impression with the Samsung LN-T4061F was very good.  I previously had a 25 year old Zenith 27 inch CRT TV with an older RCA HD satellite receiver to receive OTA HDTV (no satellite).I live from 25 to 90 miles from broadcast sources, and I must say that the LN-T4061F does a fantastic job at pulling in HDTV signals.  My external TV antenna is circa early 90's.The overall functionality of this TV is very impressive, as well.  The remote is fairly cleanly laid out, and accomplishing a desired task is pretty simple.  Please read other reviews, such as at CNET.com, that more extensively and comprehensively provide analysis of this TV.As for the purchase process, the where and how you procure your TV may cause you more anxiety than finding the actual display itself.I, like many other reviewers, was VERY apprehensive about buying something this expensive from an online retailer.  The following is the process I went through:I did my due diligence by reading copious numbers of reviews regarding various online retailers, using search engines (i.e. google) to make sure nothing came up with them(there are scammers out there, to be sure!).Following the reviews, I called the retailer's customer service department first, not the sales department. I wanted to review their policies for shipping, pricing guarantee, damaged goods, product returns, etc.  I've found that a retailer that answers their customer service line as promptly as their sales line provides a good indication of their level of commitment to their customers and not just turning inventory.After deciding on a retailer, I called the customer service line from the manufacturer (in this case Samsung).  I asked the company to explain how they handled service issues both during and after the warranty period.Finally, after being satiated by the answers given by all involved, I called the retailer (PlasmaBay.com), I ordered my TV, selected express shipping (FedEX), and 3 business days later, viola!When the TV arrived, AFTER thoroughly inspecting the box for damage, as instructed by the retailer, I signed for the shipment.  The TV was double boxed and arrived in great condition.Purchasing from an online retailer has its pros and cons.  In my opinion, the pros, not the least of which was saving nearly $400 verses buying from a big box retailer, far outweighed the cons (mainly, not being able to try it out and return it if not satisfied).  The important thing to remember is: Do your due diligence BEFORE you make your purchase and the cons will be almost negligible.If you choose the Samsung LN-T4061F, I'm quite certain you will be as thoroughly satisfied as I am!", "Date": "December 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Glad I made the jump to digital", "Author": "Chris Keener", "ReviewID": "R1KOFOYU6BECWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a JVC 32\" CRT (analog) television for nearly seven years, it was the top rated TV at the time and I was happy with it. With everything going digital, however, I decided to upgrade my home theater set up; I have also had DISH network for seven years and wanted to take advantage of their HD content. Therefore, I started doing ALOT of research on TVs, receivers, DVD players, etc.What concerned me was that I watch tons of old, black and white movies and reviews kept talking about contrast, black levels, and backlighting making it seem that an LCD would be all washed out and black wouldn't be black and you wouldn't be able to discern details in the shadows. Well, it appears, at least in my mind, that the majority of these reviews are written by videophiles who have nothing better to do than sit around with a light meter and take readings all day long and try to find something wrong when there is nothing wrong. This LCD displays my black and white films with great clarity, with blacks that are black, and details quite discernible in the shadows. I couldn't be happier.I chose this LCD because it met the space requirements for my entertainment unit, because it had a non-glare screen (being in a pretty bright room), and it had great reviews, especially for the contrast(black) levels. Also, I went to Best Buy and compared it against other models and it outshone all of them and was on a level with Sony. The HD content is stunning--I can't wait till this is the norm. Also, it's good to now be able to take advantage of widescreen format without cropping the picture and squinting to make out details. I had bought only widescreen format DVDs for years, knowing this day was coming.There have been a couple of times that an old movie will occasionally look like a paint by number painting, but the original print was obviously not in the best shape. This has been rare. Also, some network broadcasts don't look great on close inspection--and I suppose this is what the \"experts\" keep carping about--but, by and large, I have not regretted my decision one bit. DVDs look great, DISH network is great, games on a Wii are great, some other broadcasts look fair to good--therefore, the consensus points to 5 stars.", "Date": "December 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Review Samsung LNT4061F purchase from Amazon.com", "Author": "Richard L.

I don't think for a 40\" LCD an up-converting DVD player is needed. TV looks sleek and very modern. I didn't see any clouding or banding issues even with movies like the illusionist. Black levels are very good. There is no glare/reflection with this model (4065/66 had plenty of glare just like a plasma TV) so it makes it easy to watch even with plenty of ambient light. This is the biggest reason I went with LCD. PC via VGA looks great. Netflix online looked better than digital SD. USB input to play MP3 and watch JPEGS is a bonus.

I have most of them turned off and just play with contrast, brightness, color, sharpness and backlight. Even after a month I keep adjusting the picture for various inputs. Audio from PC could not be played directly on the TV. I think the audio amp in the TV is weak. Had to listen via home theater system. Audio quality as such is average. This TV does not have auto fill mode for different formats. This is painful to keep changing the picture size manually while flipping through channels.

I found out this was not the dreaded image burn but \"image persistence\"  This would go away after a day or so only to return after another watching.  Shortly after this began the TV would not turn on.  I would hit the power button and it would just sit and Beep and not come on.  After about an hour the TV would finally come on.  I contacted a service rep from a large Chain electronic store and they replaced two capacitors inside the TV.  Service call 190.00.  About the image burn...  \"I mean image persistence\"  I would have to replace the screen...  Samsung new LCD screen= 645.00. Plus labor.  If I was going to go buy another TV, I would skip this brand.For the price this TV has a fantastic picture and when it worked it was fabulous I could not have been happier.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Broke after a year", "Author": "Joseph J.

Then every time the TV is powered on, it began making a clicking a few times before it turned on.  It started with a few clicks about a second apart, then the TV would turn on.  Then the number of clicks began to increase.  Now it clicks about 50-60 times before it turns on, and all you can do is sit there and wait.After doing a bit of online research, it seems that this is a common problem.  Evidently the parts that Samsung used to build the internal power board on are cheap and blow out after a year or so.  The only thing to do is take it in and get it fixed at a repair shop, which will cost hundreds of dollars.  Alternately, you can try opening the TV up and soldering new capacitors onto the board inside the TV, but you are doing this at your own risk.I'm very disappointed in this TV and will definitely go with a Sony next time around.", "Date": "December 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great product, great delivery", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R2EHYJYM3GT4MH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I had done a ton of research on HD televisions and had already decided on this one or the LNT4065F.

But when I saw the 61 model in a store and realized that I could save from a couple to a few hundred dollars I opted for the 61.  And boy, I'm not at all disappointed in that decision.The 4061 is a terrific TV.  Besides looking great, the performance of the TV is what I had hoped it would be.PROS- Fit and finish is terrific.  I've been a huge fan of Samsung lately, and this will continue my fanaticism- The Picture quality and brightness are top notch.  Ok, it doesn't have 120Hz refresh (btw, that's pretty amazing), but I really feel that didn't need to be a requirement in my viewing of movies or watching a low quality TiVo recording.- The color saturation and contrast is terrific.  It sounds crazy, but sometimes it just seems the image is popping out of the screen.- DVD and Game performance is perfect.  I have an older Samsung 50\" DLP and there's a double digit millisecond video delay, which is horrible for playing games.CONS- The blacks aren't as black as I had hoped.  Especially in a pitch dark room.  It could be that I have it sitting on top of an entertainment center.  I just purchased a wall mount for it and hope that will help.  I think it may be light pollution from the lamp.  I'm also considering having it tuned by a professional.  I have a couple of tuning DVD's, but it's pretty complicated- There appears to be a slight manufacturing glitch / defect on the bottom portion of the screen along the bezel.  For instance, you know when you put your finger on a LCD screen and the colors change.  Well, that's whats happening on the lower part of the screen.  You can only see it when the screen is black.---In conclusion, I would highly recommend this TV to anyone.  If you desire an upgrade, get the model with 120hz refresh.  If not, this model offers the best bang for your buck.", "Date": "April 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Had to be repaired in the first week", "Author": "Nataliya V.

As a result, someone stayed in the house all day Thursday, all day Friday and all day Saturday, and it came Saturday at 7:30 pm (their normal delivery hours are 10 to 5 !)I called about 20 times during these 3 days and got all kinds of stupid excuses.Anyway, the TV came and we were thrilled to finally watch it. After about 3 days the problems started. First, the TV started to turn off and on all by itself. The frequency of this happening increased during the next 2-3 days. Then, after it turning off by itself, the normal picture woudln't come back - just pink screen with stripes and slightly visible picture as a background. This would go on for about 10 minutes and then the normal picture would come back. We called Samsung immediately, I have to say their customer service is much better than that of Eagle ;-). Actually, they are pretty good. They sent a technician right away (within 2-3 days) and he replaced the main board in the TV. Now it is finally working fine. I hope this was the last problem we had ;-) I was saying: never again I will buy such big expensive thing on amason, but after comparing the price in Best Buy (where you can return/replace) this purchase was worth it (1699 in Best buy and 1129 on amason).

Not only was the color more vivid and the blacks darker, but the picture quality itself was visually sharper and cleaner than even the 40\" SONY sitting below it.  As I have a home theater setup, the speakers have not been a problem for me, however from a few minutes of listening to them I can honestly say that they fare reasonably well to most average TVs.The greatest advantage this TV has is its ability to store and memorize settings between input devices.  It has been a blessing to set up my Oppo DVD player using settings A and have my HD Box set up using settings B, etc... This allows customers to customize every input device without having to constantly change between settings.  Samsung has also done a great service in its offering of picture sizes - well done.Every positive I can think of has pretty much been described in other reviews - so read those, because they truly encompass the strengths of this unit.

It is very bright, has great contrast and a nice design.  The only problem I've had with it is some blurriness and pixelation with fast motion.  Decreasing the sharpness helped some but I'm not sure if the problem lies in the limitations of the tv itself(refresh rate) or something else like the source of the video (mine is HD cable TV) or some other setting on the tv.  That being said, this is NOT a significant problem.  You have to look pretty closely to notice it and it only occurs with fast moving objects.  Other than that, the TV has a spectacular picture.

My goal was to achieve a setup with XBOX360, PC, Cable TV, and DVD all in one system.  And make no mistake, I have been looking for many months b4 finally pulling the trigger with this Samsung LNT4061F 40inch LCD.  I have had this LCD for the last 2 weeks, and here are the results...Why did I choose this particular model???I did ALOT of eye shopping at BestBuy and Circuit City to determine my choice.  By far, this model and Samsung in general had the best color quality I could see.  I am by no means an expert in LCDs, but when I am looking at different LCDs side by side, it is fairly easy for me to determine which set is better.  I am sure you can too!  So go to BestBuy or any other places, and look at different models.  You will see what I mean when I say that Samsung seems to have it right overall.To start off, I ordered the Samsung LCD on a Sunday evening, and it arrived on a Tuesday afternoon!!  The dilivery was through the standard Eagle Shipping service.  The delivery man was most helpful, and opened the merchandise with care.  He powered up the LCD, and made sure all the pixels and systems were functional.  A++++++++Next I began the process of connecting all my toys together...XBOX360:Make sure you switch the button to \"HDTV\" on your XBOX360.  The picture is beautiful and full of color.  Of course I had to fiddle with the color settings a bit, but it was easy and straight forward.  The refresh rate is excellent, and gameplay has quadrupled in fun factor.  All I can say is WOW!Cable TV:I have normal digital Cable service, and most channels come in at normal 480i resolution.  These channels are definitely \"watch-able\" on a daily basis.  There are about a dozen free channels that are in High Definition 1080i resolution.  I have placed these channels in my \"Favorites\" section, and watch them religiously just to get the full effect of the LCD.  When you can see the most intricate of details that you never thought possible, the content of the show begin to lose its relevance, and you start to watch shows just for the heck of it.  But for those of you who demand content, I absolutely love the ESPN-HD channel, and Universal-HD shows many great movies in full 1080i.DVD:Its like going to the movies.  Great picture quality and production despite the 480i native resolution of all DVD movies.  I find myself watching old movies I had already seen many times over.PC:A bit tricky...First off, if you do not have a DVI or HDMI slot on your PC, USE THE VGA CONNECTION.  DO NOT USE THE S-VIDEO CONNECTION!!!  The reason for this is that the S-Video cable is limited to 800x600 resolution.  The VGA cable allows you to go much higher in resolution.Next...Make sure your video card on your PC is decent.  The video card in my laptop cannot support 1920x1080.  Instead, it is limited to 1600x1200.  Make no mistake, this is a great resolution and makes everyday computing a great experience.  However, if you want to use the full effect of the LCD, make sure your PC video card supports the 1920x1080 resolution.  The bottom line with PCs is that the better quality PC you have, the better quality picture you will see on your Samsung.  If your PC or laptop is able to support only 1200x800, that is what you will see on your LCD.  My current setup is at 1600x1200 with the LCD setup to display 4:3 ratio.  This setup leaves the sides of my LCD unused, but diplays everything in correct proportions.  Even with the sides unused, the picture is gigantic!Bottom Line:Nice BIG picture, and great color and quality.  To top that off, the price is the best ANYWHERE.  Go ahead and scourge the Internet to find a better price for the quality, and you wont find it anywhere.  And finally, the experience is just awesome...  games and movies become an immersive experience :)", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Happy overall", "Author": "Mark Benninger", "ReviewID": "R3PHVK2G3GBFAS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this set about 2 months ago.  The buying experience on Amazon was very good and Eagle got it to me on time after initially \"losing\" the set but locating it on the truck the next day (had me worried).  The delivery guy got \"lost\" and he seemed to be in a hurry but that is how it is I suppose.  I am still tweaking the PQ settings and getting used to how standard def channels look and the variables associated with HD PQ.  Setting options are nice, but one can drive themselves insane trying to fine tune everything for each source.  That being said, this set offers a stunning HD picture and a tolerable to good standard def picture (as far as these HDTV's are concerned).  Blacks are black enough for me and the color this set produces is great.  I haven't viewed a 1080p source on it yet but am waiting for the price of the Toshiba XA2 HD DVD player to come down a bit to take advantage of the HDMI 1.3 with deep color and the Reon processor for upconversion.  The menu system is fairly straight-forward and easy to navigate.  As far as looks, I'd probably prefer a matte finish over the glossy.  I think the blacks would appear darker contrasted with the lighter shade of a matte black finish vs. the piano black.  But in a darkened room, it is moot.  And the glossy is aesthetically pleasing as an element in the room.  The remote is ok, but I'd like for it to have full illumination and some of the buttons I use often are tiny.OK, now I'll cut to the chase and the 2 main problems I have with the set so far.  The first is seen when viewing digital channels (mainly SD) via the QAM tuner.  I bought an a/b switch so I could split the feed and switch between the STB and the QAM which gave me several HD channels.  But the SD channels with the QAM contained what can be described as horizontal digital bands throughout the picture which distorted the edges of colors.  It is much like the macro-blocking while watching fast action on some HD feeds.  The repair shop concluded there was a problem and replaced the tuner board but it didn't fix it so maybe this is a problem with the feed from RCN and not the set.  Anyway, since I wanted to use the QAM for the extra HD channels (which were good), this wasn't that big a deal.  Just a hassle to have to switch back and forth for the best quality SD and the HD channels.  I have since upgraded with a Moto DCT3416 I DVR with the HD package.  So that takes care of that issue.  With the new STB, most SD channels look better while many of the HD channels look slightly worse (due to compression of the feed?). Good move overall to upgrade I'd have to say.The second, more annoying problem involves an intermittent horizontal cloud/mist through the center of the picture.  It is like the clouding problem on Sony and Sammy LCD's (which I have a bit of in the upper RH corner of my set) but it shows up intermittently and runs straight through the middle of the screen.  I was able to alleviate it to a large degree by adjusting the brightness level to about 40.  Any lower than that and I lose a lot of detail in darker scenes.  It still shows up somewhat however.  I am conflicted about this issue and whether this is normal for this LCD or if I should contact the repair shop about it.  Also, the clouding in the upper right hand corner I mentioned is tolerable, but is this really something I should have to live with in an $1800 set?  I've seen pictures posted in forums of the clouding in Sony Bravias, and it is present all over the screen.  Should I just be happy my panel doesn't have any stuck pixels or worse clouding?Overall, I'd say this purchase has been a wise one.  The best picture this set has to offer is nothing short of spectacular.  On the downside, tweaking the settings to get everything just right for the various sources has been a tedious and ongoing process.  Par for the course with relatively new technologies I guess.  Once I get some 1080p on it (Toshiba HD DVD player or possibly Blue Ray) and broadcast HD continues to grow and improve, I should be good to go for quite a while.I hope this review has been helpful and I hope someone can offer some advice on the issues I described (mainly the clouding).

Rowley", "ReviewID": "R1TMF8TCR5TFTL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this TV at Circuit City maybe a year or so before they went under.  It was within my price range, it was LCD, and it was large enough for what I needed at the time.The picture looks great for games.  Other media shows some grain, especially in darker shots.  It took me some tweaking to get the best picture as possible but the grain is still there.  There's no glare from light, like older TVs, but light still shines off of it and can obstruct viewing so keeping the screen pointed away from sunlight is a good idea.I had the TV for a little more than a year before it started to have issues.  Another review mentions that the model had some sort of faulty component inside that affects the power and mine was no different.  I'd push the power button and it would sit there clicking for 30 minutes before the TV finally turned on... then it wouldn't turn on at all.  I had to take it to a specialty shop to get it fixed.  I've had the TV since and haven't had any similar problems.More recently, it seems that images like to burn into the screen for a bit.  You leave it at a menu screen or pause something for longer than a minute (my estimation, not proven) and you'll see remnants of the brighter spots during play and they'll stay there for a bit.  Obviously, this could be fixed if I were to lower the brightness, contrast, and backlight, but I have those settings to where it looks best when viewing.  I've also got a darker spot in the lower middle of the screen now.  This indicates to me that the TV screen is going bad, I've seen it happen before.  I've already ordered a new TV to replace it.Also, the TV produces a decent amount of heat.There are 3 HDMI ports, two RGB Component hook ups, two S-Video hook ups, a USB port, Digital Audio Out, PC in (as well as some audio hook up that I'm unfamiliar with), DVI Audio in for HDMI port 1, and a Headphone jack.  The remote does in fact have some sort of lag and has a bunch of useless buttons, and switching between HDMI ports takes too long for some reason.  If you have a Samsung device connected (like a Blu-Ray player) turning off the TV turns off the device, but so does switching sources on the TV... it's annoying... it's ok though, Samsung Blu Ray players kinda suck... really, if you're going to get a Blu-Ray player, it's probably best to get one from the company that developed the tech anyway, and that would be Sony.Anyways, there's couple good reasons why you can't find many of these TVs anymore.  Either people decided to discard them after they encountered the faulty power issue, or they fixed it and left it as a hand me down as this TV makes a great hand me down item once that little problem is fixed.  If you plan on getting one of the few that are for sale, make sure you know if their actually operational and if the faulty capacitors installed in the power control board have been replaced.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dreaded clicking, delayed power on, and spots - DO NOT buy this TV", "Author": "miniowner \"miniowner\"", "ReviewID": "R2GCNOE048GJV8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had this TV for a few years, and started recently getting the clicking sounds and delays when turning it on.

Honestly it came down to this TV and the Sony Bravia KDL-40V3000 40-inch 1080p LCD HDTV both of which I feel are excellent choices.  After looking at them in stores and reading a lot of reviews I decided on the Samsung because it has more inputs, is HDMI 1.3 compatible, and cost less.  I have a lot of Samsung products and they are all top quality products.The Picture is just superb.  I have it hooked up with HDMI 2M (6 Feet) Super High Resolution Cable by DVI Gear which work wonderfully.  SDTV thru my digital cable box is acceptible depending on what you are watching.  It was actually better than what I expected after reading reviews that it was \"just unwatchable\".  It is a little grainy, but acceptable for a LCD TV.  What can you expect mixing new technology with old analog signals?  HDTV on the other hand is incredible.  Watching NCAA tournament games just blows me away.  It's like you're there; very clear, true colors, and almost no motion blur.  My PS3 is also a totally new experience.  Graphics are great. I can see individual blades of grass in my Tiger Woods 07 game.  Sometimes I forget it's just a video game and it's output at 720p.  Craziness!  Blu-ray movies are also just as wonderful.Sound is acceptible and I would say bordering on good.  You can definately hear it.  It's not quiet or hallow as others have described it.  It's not surround sound or anything like that, but you can get by with it if you want.  I have mine hooked up to a 5.1 surround sound system so I don't listen to the TV's sound often only when the little one is watching some DVD's so sound is really a none issue for me.Overall I wouldn't hesitate to buy this TV again.

Choose \"White Glove\" shipping.  The set arrived in the timeframe Amazon anticipated.  I called Eagle and arranged delivery.  They delivered the set on time, brought it in the house, unboxed it and placed it on the stand.  I asked if we should at least plug it in and verify that it could boot up.  The driver said no, that wasn't part of their \"White Glove\" service, just delivery, unpacking and lifting in place.After the driver left I plugged it in and hooked it up to the Comcast Cable HDTV Digital Set Top box using component cables.  It seemed to work OK, but I had some problems, like the volume comtrol would not scroll up.  I had to press the remote button for each step and sometimes when pressing the button the set would power off.  After many attempts at getting both the cable remote and the Samsung remote to work, I tried the switches on the side and front of the LCD TV.  Nothing.  The switches didn't work, but the set would work with the remote.Called Samsung Support and they set up a dispatch for repair under warranty.  I did not attempt to send the set back for a replacement.  A few days later the repair tech came out and did a professional job taking the set back off and replacing the power switch board and cables.  It appears that one of the cables got crimped when the back cover was installed.  That fixed the switches and even the remote volume problem went away.Now I am trying to get the HDMI cable to work.  No luck so far.  Don't know if the problem is with the Samsung LCD or the Comcast 4240HDC Set Top Box.  The HDMI input has noisy audio and the video took a few minutes to finally come in and was grainy with green snow.  So went back to the five component and audio 8 foot cables, instead of the preferred 3M HDMI cable.Overall, the order process, deliver, etc went as hoped, no real problems.  The Samsung 4061 has a beautiful picture and I guess that the crimped cable wasn't the end of the world.  (Should have been caught in final test though...)  Would or will I order the next big TV over the internet?  Possibly.

I wanted a hdtv that was excellent to watch blu ray movies on, but at the same time, I wanted a good hdtv for my ps3 and 360 since I am a serious video gamer. I was curious about the 120hz samsung, to be honest I did not find any difference between this hdtv and the same size with 120hz. I am sure later on in the future there will be a hdtv better than 120hz. But now I am satisfied with this hdtv for now. I have looked at the complaints about the sound being weak in that department, I do find it weak, but average. I will be getting a surround home system sometime anyway.

Here's the deal - LCD tv's, especially large high definition ones, do not display regular TV very well.  Do not judge one by this, also, don't believe what you see in the store is what you'll have at home.  When good high definition material is sent into the TV using the correct connections (Component or HDMI), more than likely you will be pleased with the results.First thing, go to a channel that displays strictly HD material and tune your TV to it.  Reduce the backlight, bump up the contrast, cut down on the sharpness (sounds reverse of having a HD tv, but it smooths the picture's harshness out), and tune in the color on skintones.  You will be happy.DO NOT BUY A HIGH DEF TV IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO VIEW HD MATERIAL!!!  Sounds simple, but I know a lot of people that have the flat screens and don't bother to look into high def cable or satellite.I am very pleased with the Samsung so far.  The picture is great and it's ablilities to produce black (more difficult for LCD than plasma) is very good.  I would like to really stretch the 1080p capabilities soon with a high definition DVD player, but I'll wait until they sort out the format and get cheaper.For now, the DirecTV signal is sending in some pretty nice stuff - I particularly like the following HD channels: Weather, CNBC, ESPN, CNN, and the local channels.

The TV finally arrived after a 3 week litany of bungled orders, lost shipments, 2 wasted days waiting for deliveries that didn't come, hours on the phone attempting to contact customer service and culminated with two clowns tracking heavy grease from one end of my house to the other.  Essentially Amazon didn't know what they had shipped and the carrier certainly didn't know where it was.

Compared directly with other sets right next to it in the store (bb), this picture just POPPED.  I'm not an A/V expert, but I do know when I've seen a shoddy LCD picture.Was going to go plasma, but the weight, burn-in, etc. and the lack of sets with a PC input, 3 HDMI, USB, made me look for this Samsung unit... And I've had it for a week and couldn't be happier!  Even using cheesy svideo on a non-upconvert dvd player is great, PS2 is great... Haven't tried a BlueRay or HDDVD player yet, but I'm sure it would beat my hd cable.Some who have reviewed this tv also reported problems with HDMI, which I haven't seen yet... But there are apparently firmware and/or hardware replacements available from Samsung themselves; so they are aware of a problem.  (Apparently very rare screen misses show up, or something, I can't really figure out what the problem ACTUALLY is...)  But you might want to check into it if you're overly paranoid.The only thing I'd wish for so far is a toslink optical and coaxial input TO the tv so that the tv can be the main switch for all my other A/V gear here, since it so nicely has a toslink OUT which would by perfect to hook to my sound system.  If this had toslink and coax in, then I could cycle through all my A/V gear by just tapping the \"Source\" button on the tv's remote.Oh well.  At least my receiver has all the bells and whistles; that would have just been a nice extra. :-)  Maybe someday I'll be all HDMI.Anyway, this set kicks but and livens up the living room in my house.

The screen is simply gorgeous (check out Sunrise Earth on Discovery HD to see how clear it really is).Some people complain about the speakers, but buying a flat screen TV without getting a separate audio system is like buying a sports car without manual transmission.  Even better, the speakers are below the TV rather than on the side as seen in the 4065, so it saves room.

(i was too depressed to go)2 weeks after the repairman came and \"fixed\" it everything seemed fine...THEN TAMPA BAY goes to the world series for the first time ever!it had been quite a few months so i thought the problem was finally fixed, NOT SO MUCH!! :( in the middle of game 2 ONCE AGAIN! my TV fails me, this time the screen is totally black but now i can hear audio, called samsung (wooo hoo!) and now i really asked about changing this TV which is obviously broken, they gave me the same run around and were actually totally rude to me, telling me things such as \"sorry we cant help you\" isnt that what customer service is for? to help you?!!Now they told me that this is the last time they will attempt to fix it, and that if it does break again that they will change it, i called the repair shop, (where i already know the guys on a first name basis) and the told me that this time they will be changing the WHOLE panel, basically the whole TV, but that after this there is nothing they could change. i been waiting a week now for the part to arrive so they can come and repair it and im still WITHOUT MY TV!!Lesson Learned: NEVER again will i make a purchase on amazon for an electronic of such value, i would much rather go get one of the local stores where i know that even if the TV breaks i will deal with it  personally and they will exchange it, and even though i saved $300 through amazon ITS NOT WORTH IT!!stick to selling books and small articles please, that i will buy.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN-T4061 - disappointed; maybe a bad one", "Author": "The hycodude", "ReviewID": "R293L2DEUJJ4P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV after comparing it to other LCDs in a big box store.  I thought the Sony's had a slightly better picture, but for the money, the Samsung was a better value.  This TV has very impressive specs and has just about every connection you could imagine or need.I have a roof-top antenna that feeds two HDTV's - a two-year old 42\" plasma and a 19\" LCD.  I also have a 26\" LCD on a separate Mini-State antenna.  All three give excellent pictures.  I'm not an expert, but I have a working knowledge of HDTV's.  When I hooked this one up to the antenna and a 1080p upconverting DVD home theater (antenna directly to TV, home theater through HDMI), the picture was terrible.  It didn't matter if it was 480i, 480p, or 720p.  I tried adjusting the picture with preset settings and manually with no improvement.  Words and graphics were fuzzy and motion was blurry.  The only time the picture was acceptable was through the upconverting DVD player.  Even then, it wasn't obvious we were watching anything close to 1080p.I returned the TV to Amazon, which started out as a painless procedure.  I have no complaints against the trucking company, Novacor/CEVA.  They delivered it back to Amazon in 5 days.  It then took Amazon over two weeks to issue a refund.  The story I got was that the delivery truck was involved in an accident and the TV was damaged.  Why should that hold up my credit?  The TV and Amazon get two stars.  Novacor/CEVA gets four - I don't know whose fault the accident was so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.P.S. I went back to the big box store and compared a Panasonic plasma side-by-side to Sony and Samsung LCD's.  There is no comparison, the Panasonic wins hands down.  The LCD's were certainly better than my Samsung, but not as good as the plasma.", "Date": "May 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung engineers have not heard of convergence", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R4NML1NWNFFTK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for the family room for the primary purpose of watching DVDs but also with the idea of hooking it to a PC, so that I could play family movies, check the weather or movie schedules before leaving the house etc.  I was very surprised to find out that the link between the video signal out of the TV and the LCD is lost once the computer goes into hibernation.  Upon returning from hibernation the LCD does not see the PC signal and therefore the screen goes to black.  I'm no engineer but I see no reason for this lack of foresight on the part of the Samsung engineers.  Have they not heard of convergence and global warming?  The workaround this problem are not pretty.  One can leave the PC ob all the time so the monitor does get confused.  Environmentally, this would be unacceptable.  Instead, you can turn the PC completely off .  Of course, in that case there is no such thing as doing a quick check before leaving the house because you either have to wait for the rebooting or run upstairs to the main computer. All of this because the designers did not anticipate this kind of functionality.  To add insult to injury, the level 1  support department is not well informed about this problem.  They attributed to the fact that the resolution I had the PC set to was incompatible with the LCD.  This is false since I had the resolution exactly to what they said it should be.  The level 2 support acknowledged the problem but would not accept that this lack of functionality is a design flaw.

The CC I bought it from had cable TV hooked up and showed many different programs on ALL the TV's and you could get a good side by side comparison with the Sony models etc...  This Samsung kept jumping out at me because of it's CRISP picture.  They put on the Yankees game in High Def and it was breathtaking (As Dr Evil would say) how clear and awesome the picture was.  Can't wait for Football and then my NY Rangers to get back on the Ice this fall!Then they put on the the movie \"Cars\" by Pixelar on an HD channel... and once again this TV looked so vibrant and crystal clear I was blown away.  There were a few HDTV's I kept comparing and this LNT34061F model kept winning the battles imo... especially since it was much cheaper than the Sony 40 inch 1080p models... and had a better picture!Then they put on the Indy 500 and once again the picture was incredible.  At that point I was sold on this TV and bought it on Sale.  After getting it home and setting it up (which was easy as all can be)... and hooking up the game consoles... Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii and PS2... it was time for the real test and to see how the systems and games looked.  And I'm happy to say the TV passed once again with flying colors!  Even the PS2 games looked good on this TV.  The Wii games looked great... and the 360 games looked spectacular.  Also, I never noticed any lag time whatsoever between controller actions to TV screen action... which is what some gamers have talked and complained about on some HDTV's.  I think the newer HDTV's like this one have solved the lag problem.My next purchase must be a PS3 once I can afford one later this year sometime hopefully... to really take advantage of the the TV's 1080p stuff from the Blu Ray player in the PS3.As far as the Standard def channels go... they look good through by HD Cable Box... but light years away from what the HD Channels look like.  I think that's the problem with HDTV's in general... there just aren't enough HD Channels yet! Let's go already!  But let's face it... your buying an HDTV to watch HD stuff most of the time... and this model gets it's done Big Time!  I find using the \"Stretch\" view on Standard Def channels makes them more fun to watch.One last thing if you have a HDMI input on your Cable box.... get a \"Monster\" HDMI cable to run to the TV.  It's a bit pricey compared to lesser brands... but you'll be glad when you see the quality picture it delivers.
