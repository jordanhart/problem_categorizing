About four hours after receiving it and I haven't left my room.This TV is simply lovely so far.  The setup was a bit confusing at first and the stand is not the best I've ever seen but the instructions for setting up the stand were adequate and I was able to get the TV up and running in about ten minutes (the first five of which I sat confused).Really, the negatives on this purchase stopped after the setup and the stand.  Besides the stand, this TV is just pretty.  One of the first things that stood out to me was the fact that the screen is so sleek and does not reflect any glares at all.  Also, I had read about a terrible viewing angle and I honestly watched this TV from the side with no difference in the picture at all.  It's so big that it's practically impossible to have a bad seat in the room that you watch this TV.If you plan on playing video games on this TV, you will not be disappointed in the least.  The only issues I've had with the TV is getting my colors juuuust right, although the \"Game\" picture setting has sufficed very nicely.The sound on the TV is great.  It is centered and doesn't feel empty in the least.  It is a very full and rich sound that will work just fine if you don't have an expensive surround sound system.After paying [...] and receiving free two day shipping, I am literally ecstatic that I was able to nab such a nice TV.  After spending the last three years with a 24\" Insignia LCD that was 720p, I am ready to lock myself in my room.If you are like me and can't shell out more than 500 dollars for an HD TV, this is the TV you want to pick up right away.  I simply cannot find anything that I dislike beyond the stand itself that makes me rate this any less than 5 stars.Don't be alarmed by the 60hz refresh rate, I honestly can't see how 60hz is so inferior to 120.  Especially when 120hz is almost 500 dollars more expensive.Trust me, if you are on the fence about this TV -- take the leap.

Browning", "ReviewID": "R1F9ZU4J6PJJV3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off: We did not purchase this TV from Amazon, we purchased it at a local retail store, not for any other reason than the price (we paid a few hundred less than the current Amazon price)My husband and I purchased this back in April, it was either this or the Phillips that they had set right beside it, it was really a hard choice as the Phillips was marked down to just a few hundred dollars, whilst this was just under six fifty. We are so very glad that we went with this model(42LD450). The video quality is quite good, blacks are black, and whites are white, back light is very bright, and video quality is amazing.We almost took this back however: When we first plugged it in and turned it on, the only picture was a white screen with the Firmware version bouncing around, no menu would come up and it would not acknowledge anything had been connected. Well, we unplugged it again, and turned it back on, and this time, it acknowledged the DVR (input 1) and starting spewing forth video and audio We have had no problems since that.My only gripe is that we will have to go out and purchase a new unit for our surround system, as the TV only has a Optical Audio Output. And on that note, the built in speakers are not awesome, yes, they are very usable, but like almost all TV speakers, they are not going to satisfy your need for spectacular surround.This is definitely worth the buy, I really think you will be happy with your purchase.

Precourt", "ReviewID": "R3EB97LP6SATU0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV to replace my 3-year old Samsung Series 3 32\" LCD TV in my master bedroom because I wanted a larger size TV now that prices have dropped a good bit (paid over $1,400 for my 32\" a few years ago). I debated between this one and a 40\" Samsung for the same price, both were 60hz models, which is fine since I'm only using this for my DVR. Since I've seen a few older LGs before that had decent picture quality, I went with this one for it's larger size with slighly better specs than the Samsung, although I've always preferred Samsung. I figured since this was a newer model than those I've seen, with better specs I couldn't lose....  I was wrong!I put this one on the wall where my old one was and my first night watching it I was quite disappointed! Although the picture is sharp and vibratant, it's only that way if you are directly in front of it. The viewing angel is terrible with this set, especially vertically below, which is my problem since I'm using this on a wall in my bedroom and viewing it from the bed, which puts me slighly below the screen (the TV is just above my dresser, maybe 3 feet above the floor). In this position, the screen washes out terribly, much like some of the older laptop displays did. Blacks become gray and colors very washed out. My Samsungs don't have this problem, neither my old 32\" or my 52\" in the living room. The construction itself is also very flimsy compared to the Samsung models I've owned. It's strange though, that I installed a 42\" LG for a friend that's over 2 years older than this one and it was much more solid and has a better picture and viewing angle than this one.I realize this is a lower-end set, and I did not want the best just for the bedroom, but considering that I replaced a 3 year old set with only 30,000:1 contrast ratio and 720p with this one that is supposed to be 100,000:1 and 1080p and yet my old one produced much deeper blacks and vibrant whites and colors, I'm quite dissapointed.  Also, another reviewer mentioned that he didn't notice any backlight coming out of the back, but that's not my experience. While I've seen worse, this one projects a good bit of backlight out through all the vents onto the wall. I guess I can live with it, but why? None of my others had this issue either.I was considering returning it, but don't feel like going through the hastle and don't want to spend a bunch more money to get a higher-end set. I decided to change my wall mount to a tilt mount and angle the TV downward, with it slighly higher on the wall and that helps a good bit because it gets the viewing angel of the TV perfectly alligned with my viewing area, so it looks pretty good now and I can deal with it.Bottom line, I'm going to be happy with it, but I'm not truly happy! I wouldn't recommend this one personally and if I had to do it over I probably would have gone with the 40\" Samsung instead, or paid a little more to get a 42\" or 46\" Samsung.Update on 6/23/2010After trying to make myself like this TV for 3 days I decided to return it. It is just that bad!  Even with the tilt wall mount it still isn't good. The blacks are still very gray and there is so much bright gray coming thru the LCD panel that it just washes out everything and lights up the lower half of my bedroom brightly, even when there's no picture displayed. That and all the backlight purring out of the back onto the walls, which is now much more noticeable with the tilt mount.I went ahead and ordered the 40\" samsung that I probably should have got it the first place and Amazon is making the process easy. They said they will pick up the bad one when they deliver the new one.", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Price Performer", "Author": "Kev-in-Michigan", "ReviewID": "R1USTG7OHI75OH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV purchase and am pleased so far.  (Read as I don't know much about this).  Setup was simple; the price was right and it has some popular energy-saving features.The picture was sharp and clear.  Multiple preset modes (cinema, game, normal) make setup easy, but there are also custom, fine-tuning adjustments available. It does not appear to have network/internet capability, but I will purchase a Blue-ray DVD player with that feature separately.  The unit has an optical audio out so I can use my older receiver for 5.1 sound.The remote feels cheap, but gets the job done.  I imagine one rarely uses the manufacturer's TV remote so LG (and other makers) probably do not spend much on them.  I did not notice any backlight seeping out of case which I understand is a problem on some TVs.For an entry-level buyer, this was a solid purchase.  I paid $658 - I thought that was reasonable for a 1080p set in 42\".

(The delivery service only comes to Columbia once a week.) The delivery service unpacked the unit and checked for DOA, a nice touch!This LG 42\" is AMAZING. I watch broadcast TV and streaming Netflix. The HD1080 broadcasts are so sharp, it just blows me away. I find myself watching stupid TV shows just to admire the HD1080 image quality. The streaming Netflix is in 720p but still very nice. I may upgrade my broadband and ROKU box just to get the HD1080.

Still, we were happy with the first one, and after some exhaustive research, chose to buy the newer model.We also chose the 60hz version because the TV's main function was to be for videogames and film.  The jury is still a little out on the whole 120hz issue (there are always conflicting reviews and articles about whether or not it produces undesirable effects on either format, but I suspect that it does) and we would prefer to watch films as they were meant to be seen (with a persistence-of-vision effect on the eye at a refresh-rate mismatch) and play games without possible ghosting effects.  If our intention was to watch hi-def or digital television, especially sports channels, we might have gone another route.The unit arrived with no defects, and after several weeks of heavy use, nothing has come up as an issue.  No dead pixels, not dark areas of screen, no odd noises or colors or blurs.This TV definitely delivers.  Crisp, bright picture that can easily be dialed in to fit your ambient lighting and surroundings, perfectly acceptable sound quality, simple remote and setup, easy assembly on the included stand.  And at $600, it's far less money than many of the comparable models.The only unusual feature is that the included stand does not tilt forward or backward, which can make placement tricky.  This minor oversight is not enough to warrant a poor review, or even cost a star.  This would be a non-issue with a wall-mount.I've had Sony XBRs, and while this doesn't quite have the contrast and crispness those did, it does deliver a beautiful picture that will please all but the most discerning and critical eye.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "SIMPLY THE BEST PICTURE + PRICE", "Author": "DLO81", "ReviewID": "RIU0W56D78YQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took me a lot of researching and critical thinking to purchase my first HDTV.

While I'm not a big review writer, I relied on other people's reviews to make my decision, so I thought that I'd give one back to help other shoppers. The TV is very nice. I have two other large screen LCD TVs, and this one compares very well to those. The picture quality is excellent. The sound is fine. I like the look of the rounded edges. The on/off light is cool, too. The viewing angle was a recurring complaint that I read about in the reviews. The viewing angle on this LG is fine. It is the same as my other LCDs. It can be viewed from various angles with very little, if any, difference. I read a few complaints about the base, also. The base on this TV is about as sturdy as you can get with something shaped like this. I did notice that they had no metal-to-metal connections between the base and the TV. They used a plastic wafer for strength, but the base itself has only plastic where it connects to the TV. The better TVs have steel screwing into steel at the bottom connection and, sometimes, at the back connection, as well. This would have added rigidity and strength to the base of this TV, but it seems adequate, anyway. The price went down since I bought mine, but even at the price that I paid, it was a good TV for the money. Other TVs, at around this price, don't have the same specs and they probably won't be as good. The only concern that I had was the long-term quality of this brand. I remember the old Goldstar products as being mediocre. However, remembering back over the years, I have had several major brand electronic products fail prematurely on me. There's no way to know how long these things will last, no matter what brand you buy.

However, one week after I installed it, the TV just went blank. I've contacted LG's support center and they told me that I couldn't get a replacement TV - although my purchase was just a week old - and I had to wait for a technician, which would come to my house only in the following week.I've searched the web for my problem, and it seemed to me that it was a problem with the power supply board of the TV (and it seems like a common problem, as I found it pretty quickly in a lot of messaging boards). Today, the technician arrived and came to the same conclusion: a faulty power supply. However, they don't have a spare part, and I should wait until they order one from LG's and schedule another technician visit, which should take another 1-2 weeks.

Putman", "ReviewID": "R1MFG91I4UXKAN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV on November 18th to upgrade our Olevia 32\" 720p set that we had in the living room. I have been planning on this upgrade for over a year, so I've done plenty of research both online and in many different stores.First of all, the picture on this TV coming from our LG BD530 1080p Network Blu-ray Disc Player is AMAZING. The first disc I played was the Avatar (Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition + BD-Live) [Blu-ray], and I was blown away. Even my wife, who I didn't think would really notice the upgrade from our 720p set to this one at 1080p, was amazed. We've watched several movies since then and they all are beautiful. You may worry because this TV only has a 60Hz refresh rate, and \"experts\" may tell you to go with 120Hz or even 240Hz, but trust me, don't do that unless you've actually looked at TVs with a faster refresh rate. Though the picture quality will blow you away, the effect is odd (the \"soap opera effect\") and may not be what you want to watch all the time. I have noticed no problems with the 60Hz refresh rate even while watching sports and movies with lots of fast-paced action and explosions. Just make sure you do your research and know what you're getting. A bigger number does not always mean better.The picture from our ATT U-verse TV service is good, but of course not as great as a full 1080p signal from the blu-ray player (both are connected via HDMI, but the U-verse TV signal is 720p). I have noticed some artifacts and ghosting, but I really believe that is because of the signal coming from the U-verse service, and not the TV itself. I've also used my Xbox 360 quite a bit, also connected via HDMI, and it looks great. I've had no picture problems playing video games or watching Netflix.The menus are fairly easy to use, and I was able to use the Picture Wizard to easily calibrate the picture to look better than it did out of the box. It's pretty basic, but yielded pretty good results.I can't comment on the sound because I have everything hooked up to my external home theater system. I also can't comment on the remote because I control everything with my Logitech Harmony 880 Advanced Universal Remote Control.So far, the only downsides to this TV is that I wish there was at least one more HDMI input, and the bulk of the user's manual is on a CD. I'd rather have the manual in my hand in the same room as the TV if I need to check something rather than walk back and forth between the office(where the computer is) and the living room. Other than that, I have absolutely no complaints with this TV, and am quite happy with my purchase.The bottom line is this: I just don't think you're going to find a better quality TV at this price.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sweet deal ever!!!", "Author": "LCD bam!!", "ReviewID": "RZ1HHA4G3VV8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's fantastic!! 120 Hz is better than 60 Hz??

Get as little as 30 degrees off axis up, down, or sideways and you'll find yourself reaching for the remote to tweak the color. Graduated blacks such as shadows turn a ghastly mossy green. I am also unhappy with the fact that the backlight is very uneven, falling off dramatically at the edges. The dynamic color and contrast controls are not subtle in the least. They are slow to respond to changes in lighting conditions and adjustments are very noticeable. For the most part, solid blocks of color like those in cartoons look fantastic, but depictions of reality leave a bit to be desired.I believe the unit I purchased is defective as one side of the picture is slightly washed out and blurry with some vertical non-linearity. It's getting progressively worse.The sound is disappointing with almost no low end.

I purchased from the comfort of my own couch and had it delivered on Black Friday.  Easy to set-up; had it up and running in about 15 minutes after delivery.  I am SO happy with the value of this purchase for such a QUALITY LG.  I will likely stick with LG from here on out, and also likely stick with amazon and their great deals and value shipping!

Harrison", "ReviewID": "RJQWRY1BU1ZNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The wife and I purchased this TV from Amazon Friday Morning (11/26), right at the height of the Black Friday frenzy. Walmart had the 42LD400 model as one of their doorbusters, but my wife wasn't one of the fortunate ones. Came home and checked online,... surprised to discover Amazon was selling the 42LD450 model for the same price. What?!?!? I don't think a 60 tic-tocs passed before I had it in my Amazon cart and pounded on the confirm order button. Turns out we got the better model for less money, as I paid no sales taxes and their speedy 2 day shipping was free. That's $478.00 shipped. I believe this price only lasted for several hours,... by the time I passed this info on to another family member, the price had gone up 50 bucks just that quickly.The picture quality on the 42LD450 is very good, way better than some of the sets we were looking at in stores for $100+ more. The audio is acceptable, but that's of little matter to us as we will be pumping that through an external 5.1 audio-video receiver. There's been some discussion in here about how behind the 60Hz units are, well if you really do your research, you find that many of 120Hz sets do not have the processing horsepower to do the smoothing technology any justice and end up doing more visual harm that good. Plus, LD was kind enough to fit this model with one of the better LCD panels which is fast enough to process movement at 60Hz without the aid of smoothing gimicks. If you have the opportunity to do so, just check the box of the unit you're about to purchase, the full model nomenclature will be printed on the top and bottom,... ex. 42LD450-UA.CUSWLH. If the 4th letter in the last alpha string is a 'W', then you have the better S-IPS LCD panel which will handle motion and judder quite nicely without 120Hz and 240Hz tricks. If the 4th letter in this string is an 'I', then you are about to purchase the most sought after set with the best 42\" LCD panel available,... the IPS alpha panel. According to many pro reviews I've read on this set, these panels do better at 60HZ than entry level models (which the LD450 is) equipped with the lesser panels sporting 120Hz and 240Hz smoothing gadgets. The point is, anything beyond 60HZ (50HZ in Europe) amounts to nothing less than electronic image guessing on the part of the TV. Apparently it's cheaper to use guessing technology than to just employ the use of a top notch and speedy LCD panel from the start. The companies do a remarkable marketing job to confuse and impression folks like Heather. I will concede however, that the upper model lines do employ a more robust smoothing engine with ample processing horsepower on board to do the technology justice, but then we're talking about the XXLD550, the XXLD6XX and XXLD7XX models, as well as LG's Infinia line. In this respect, the LD520 have more in common with our LD450's than it does with the LD550,... the LD520 is the poster child for coming to the party with 120Hz smoothing and not enough horsepower to run it properly. But that's marketing for you, isn't it Heather? And keep in mind, the more image guessing you ask the TV to do (120HZ vs 240z), the more processing horsepower is needed for those guesses to be intelligent guesses. Bottom line,... poor guessing looks worst to our eyes than no guessing at all. Faster high quality LCD panels coupled with decent pulldown engines makes the need for guessing almost academic. 120Hz is like having a conversation with someone, and trying to finish each and every one of their sentences before they reach the halfway point in each sentence. 240Hz is like have the same conversation with the same person, but trying to finish each and every one of their sentences before they right at the point where they reach the 1/4 mark of each sentence. What a mess, unless you're psychic!The viewing angle on this set seems to differ depending on which LCD panel your set is blessed with. The IPS panel is said to be not as good with viewing from angles as the others. Personally, the side-to-side angel is just fine for me, but I do see some wash when viewing from below. For this reason, we may not wall mount this unit. I'm also wishing there were more than 2 HDMI ports. But all in all, this set is about the best out there at the price I paid for it, even at in it's more natural range of $549 - $599. Anything above that, I think the Samsung LN40C630 is a better option,... but only better than the LD450. Above the 600 mark, there's the 42LD550, which many believe competes very well against the Samsung.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "If you need a new TV and want to upgrade to HD, make the jump!", "Author": "Stephanie Johnston \"lovingreen\"", "ReviewID": "R3IKREJDE5JA5T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay if you are anything like me before a purchase of more than $50 bucks you spend hours and hours of research on what item you should buy- and compare quality vs price. Honestly even though the internet has opened up a whole new world, allowing consumers to research reviews and prices without leaving your door, it can be overwhelming. I previously had an analog TV- big bulky Sony 32\". To me it was the perfect size (at least the screen) minus the quality. I do not pay for cable so once the local stations all switched to HD things weren't always up to par on my analog. It finally died and I had to decide on a new TV.Of course this was now the time to do real research on HD- should I go with LCD, plasma, or LED. With my extensive research I decided on LCD- plasma seemed to have better blacks but also came with extreme sensitivity and some major problems, LED was new and a great concept but overall it has not been tweeked enough for the color to excel. So I decide get LCD and wait on the LED for next time (which will hopefully be in 10 years, haha).Next to decide was 60 hz or spend the extra $$ for 120 hz. After again extensive research I decided the 120 hz would not be of any use for me only because the blue ray DVD player (ps3) I had would not be able to transmit anything beyond 60 hz. So even if I bought a TV with 120 hz I wouldn't be using it, I would still only be using 60 hz. So if you have a blue ray DVD player or cable/satellite find out what it's capabillities are or if you are willing to spend more to upgrade those also. It mostly effects sports, and I am a football fan but I have seen no issues with the 60 hz.The next and biggest issue of them all, which manufacturer and which model? At first I was set on getting another Sony television but after reading millions of reviews a lot of consumers noted that Sony just wasn't making quality televisions like they used to. Sony has some software issues, which can be solved by updating your TV often and Samsung (leading HD television manufacturer) has some seriously hardware problems. After looking through the reviews the consenus seemed that with Samsung it was either hit or miss. They purchase the glass from (2) different places, depending on which one they used for your TV you might get that high quality TV or you might get the one the breaks down right away. This to me was not worth it. Still a little set on Sony I looked into LG since I had believed they had pretty good quality products. This television was very highly rated overall. I loved how the LG was about $150 cheaper than the Sony. I also looked at inputs. I needed something for my VCR and for my blue ray. Sony did not had a port for the VCR which concerned me. Honestly my kids still watch the old movies I had as a kid. So make sure to figure out what kind of inputs you need and make sure the TV you buy has them!Well to state the obvious I picked the LG over the Sony. I have had the TV for a few months now and have had no problems. The delivery was great. Setup was fairly easy- you do screw the TV on the stand but I love that it is so stable. It has gripping feet so it cannot slide around on the entertainment stand. The quality is good when I use a quality imput- blue ray or HD movies. You will notice the bad quality in older movies (VHS- yes I still use it!) and normal broadcasts not in HD.Okay so my last and final statement- if you are like me, so worried about being ripped off that you will do endless hours of research I hope this saves you some time. I needed a good TV that would work- and this LG did the job at a good price. Just make the jump for it! And remember to get an HD cable (amazon has them cheap) and I would recommend getting HD cable or satellite in order to really see what the TV is capable of.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Deal!", "Author": "Jamie M. Babcock \"Voraciousreader\"", "ReviewID": "R1M7YF98L1GSVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This LCD is never going to be my 54\" Panasonic plasma I own at home, coupled with our fantastic surround sound system. However, since we've had to move to my Grandmothers to help her out, it became clear we needed to upgrade from a decade old 27\" tube television.  Buying another 56\" plasma was completely out of our price range. That being said, I began my search about a month ago, found this deal on Amazon, read the reviews, and looked at it at my local Walmart because I wanted to psychically \"see\" this before I purchased it.  Walmart had this same exact set for $50.00 more plus whatever sales tax, so I ordered it from Amazon, took advantage of the free shipping and I am thrilled to see what a great set it is.As to the shipping: Fast, easy service; tracking number was sent to me via email, and the delivery date and time was sent to my phone as well via text.  I knew in advance it was coming, which came in handy since this was a gift from \"Santa\".  No issues with FedEx.Set up: No issues. I lifted this easily out of the box by sliding it on it's side on the floor, with the protective packing still on the screen, put the stand on carefully with my handy screwdriver and was able to put it up on my console by myself since it's extremely light. Once you get the stand on, it's all plug and play right from the box to the console.  It has a USB port for your devices, 1 HDMI, two AV inputs, (which was handy for my Bluray player and my new Wii) right on the back, easy peasy, and then I was onto the setup screen for my DVR/Cable box.  Does it all for you.Settings on the TV: Easy setup with the Picture Wizard and I would highly recommend setting this to your preferences, which are saved for you.  The only complaint I have is if you don't have HD cable, it will look a bit blurry on some channels, and some of the coloring is certainly not realistic, but if you play around with the settings and you're patient, you can get it just right for your particular room.  Our living room is surrounded by floor to ceiling sliding glass doors and windows, so we get a ton of sun in the room; there are constant adjustments I make depending on the hour of the day, but it's very user friendly.Ghosting...honestly, I can't tell any difference between this and my fantastic Panasonic plasma screen. In this case, 60Hz seems to do just fine for watching TV and we set up our Wii today and I've not seen any issues there either.  It might be different with our PS3, but we'll see about that.Complaints: Few;* The stand isn't great for this TV and I would like to see LG make them much more substantial or at least make them longer and slightly wider so you don't fret about it falling forward. It's cheapy black plastic resin that attracts dust right from the box.  I guess if you mount it, it becomes a non issue.* No screen saver when you pause the TV for any length like my Panasonic.  At least I know if I pause and walk away from my plasma, the screen saver will take over and I won't have to worry about my screen taking on an image of Bill O'Reilly permanently.* You have to be QUICK on that input button and make your choice or it bounces you out to \"no signal\".  It's annoying when you're trying to remember what input you need, however, I've not explored whether you can name your devices or not. That would be fantastic wouldn't it?* Audio. As with all these LCD/LED/Plasma sets, once you've had a surround sound system deliver, you can't go back to watching movies relying on just the sets speakers themselves.  Though, the nice thing about this set is it does have a decent sound delivery for just watching T.V., so that will work for now.Other than those few slight criticisms, this is a great set, worked the first time out, and I am just thrilled at the total difference between the old gray workhorse tube TV and this widescreen wonder.  The set itself is very aesthetically pleasing, shiny black, clean lined widescreen TV. Thin, light and fantastic considering last week I was thinking about buying a nice set of binoculars to see the ticker on the bottom of my 27\"!**Also, based on a horrific past experience with a Philips 52\" LCD, I bought a 3 year extended warranty off Amazon as well.  You can see my review of that fiasco under my other reviews.  Never, ever again...LG does put out a great product, and one day, this will be a great master bedroom TV for us.  In the meantime, we have a great many movies and lots of Wii to enjoy all because of a great Christmas price on this!

It took about 20 minutes to unpack it and set it up (the base was a little tricky to attach, but literally 20 minutes from opening the box to being able to sit down and watch).The TV is gorgeous. Other reviewers had mentioned you have to watch it head-on, but I was able to watch this from the floor, from an extreme side angle, and from above with no problems at all --still a beautiful, crisp image. I was also unable to see a difference between this display and the 120 hz ones I've seen.The sound isn't going to blow you away, but it is more than I would have expected from built-in speakers: loud, clear, and delivers equally well from high to low.I am currently using the TV with a DVD player, Wii, and Roku.

(Better than the 40 inch Samsung Tv I have.) Connection to home theater system and gaming consoles was straight forward and easy. The cool feature about the LG is that when you press the input button to change inputs for the TV, it displays only the inputs that are connected to the TV and the ones that are not connected is not accessible, so there is no selection of the wrong input. Tons of pre installed settings for your picture mode, clarity etc. There is also custom picture modes which you can set and save.My only gripes are that it has only 2 hdmi inputs, luckily I have a HDMI splitter so not a big issue.The other major gripe is that when I turn on the floorlamps in the TV room, the lights reflect off the TV and is very annoying to watch a movie or play games with the light on.

If that is a deal breaker for you then take note.The other prominent complaint I heard before buying is the 'depth of the black' in the picture is not great, especially when veiwed off-centre (that it appears more 'lit' grey than black). Yes, I can see that some people would have a niggly issue with it, and I can imagine that the picture would not be as good from an elevated (high mounted) position or other odd angles. But I have it at a little above (seated) eye level, facing the centre and the picture is great-even the darker action scenes look black enough for me! So this could be another deal breaker-if you intend to mount it high up on the wall, maybe consider another model. For centred eye level, it's good!There's no motion blur as I have seen from other sets around this price, and honestly if you are expecting better picture overall then you are looking for the highest spec possible and will need to spend another 3-400 I think.The sound is also good, especially for hidden speakers.

On this site, Amazon claims to use a special carrier (CEVA, Pilot or Home Direct) on T.V.s over 40 inches, and that this company will call you when they are ready to deliver it, so you can tell them when to come over.  My 42 inch TV shipped FedEx and they left it on the steps when it was 0 degrees outside.  It was pure chance that my brother noticed it while driving away, otherwise it would have been left outside the entire day, or until someone came by and said, \"Oh, look.  A free TV!\"Now that that is out of the way, I am greatly pleased with my TVs performance.  I mainly use the TV for over the air broadcasts, playing XBOX 360, and watching video from my computer.  The picture looks wonderful on HD broadcasts, and SD looks pretty good too.  One thing I love is the Cinema Zoom setting allows you to zoom in to over a dozen levels and move the picture up and down as much as you would want.  This is really helpful if a station is broadcasting shows in 4:3 letterbox, instead of 16:9.The channels change really quick, and gives several lines of text about the current show or movie, and the next broadcast on the same channel, which makes it really easy to tell what's on.I am very happy with my TV, which I got for under $500, and I think anyone would be happy with this TV.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price!", "Author": "Joxer", "ReviewID": "R6JMTNTWHPEOQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Other than Fedex knocking only once and leaving this at my front door, The TV and my Order are perfect.

He helped me remove it from the packaging it to inspect for damage, but because it was so cold, he suggest that I wait a little while to turn it on.  I assembled the stand (still not sure what one of the pieces is for though... maybe a cover for when it's wall-mounted?) then after half an hour or so turned it on and WOW, what a difference.  I mean, I went from a CRT to this, which will be a huge difference, but still, my brother has a 32\" 720p RCA that looks terrible next to this.  I'm obviously not a huge videophile, BUT this IS 1080p and I'm not sure the average person is going to notice a huge difference in refresh rate from 60Hz to 120Hz...I wasn't looking for top-of-the-line because I didn't want to spend a TON of money.  I got this for around $550-600, hooked up my XBOX 360 Slim via HDMI and my PC via VGA and the picture on both is great.Navigating menus on this TV is very easy and I the aspect ratio for both the PC and the 360 look fine.  The aesthetics of the TV are nice too - typical LG blue/red power indicator light and the gloss black finish on it is beautiful.No problems thus far (still none - 5/11/11), but I'll be sure to report back if I do have any.Another update.

We've watched more TV than we have in quite awhile - especially movies. We had never seen John Wayne's \"True Grit.\" We chose it as our first movie to watch on the new TV.

Their critiques are akin to those I encountered while contemplating purchasing the kindle3 case w/light.  The light's not even! It strains my eyes! Glad I didn't listen to them either.I am a late arrival to the flat screen party.  My previous tv was a 10 year old 1080i (4:3 and no 720p support. NOT PS3 FRIENDLY) CRT. I loved the old dinosaur and drove it into the ground. When it came time to find a replacement, I was confronted with a dilemma: LCD is old technology. Plasma, DLP, CRT--dead yesterday. LED is great and all, but, honestly, it's the manufacturer's way of saying, 'Other technologies aren't cost effective to mass produce at the moment; we're sorry LCD is still here, but we're making it better!! :)'. Well, what do i do? I have to buy something!So I bought this.My rationale was that a better low-mid range TV doesn't exist, on paper, for the price. Also, the price is reasonable enough that I'm not making a major investment, but it will hold me over until the next breakthrough technology is available (OLED perhaps?), when I DO plan on spending some bucks.So far I've spent a month with this beauty, mostly playing ps3 and using playstation's netflix app. I can confirm that the stats and specs that may seem too-good-to-be-true on paper are at the moment projecting quite nicely from the other end of my room. If you are finding yourself in a similar situation this is the no brainer buy.------------------------------Edit (1 hr later):I forgot to mention, this set does have one major flaw, and that is with the standard definition upscaler.  This was not a deal breaker for me because I don't view much SD content, but it may bother other buyers more depending on their preferences.  For example, my nintendo wii's 480p signal was handled beautifully by my aforementioned 1080i tv (which was of comparable size), but looks well below average on this LG.  I do NOT recommend this TV for a wii enthusiast!Rather than dock the TV for bobbling the quality with wii content, I dock the wii for completely dropping the ball on HD content.

In clarity, saturation, etc this one is in the top of image quality in my book. There are other wonderful TV's that are there too, so I'm not saying it's the best of the best. What I am saying though is it is very good, and among the best.The important options on this TV are all there. The ability to have 1:1 aspect ratio (\"Just Scan\") is very important for image quality IMHO. The real cinema is also excellent. The ability to quickly and easily change modes is excellent. The ability to change the labels of the inputs is a very nice touch. USB is nice as well, but doubt I'll get any use out of it. This is the kind of item that the more I own it the more I like it, where typically I find the opposite is true for many products I own. I also appreciate it a lot when I visit friends' homes that have different TV's. Before I didn't mind or even notice the quality difference. Now that I am so used to this TV, going to friends' homes makes me realize just how much of a difference there is from other TV's and these. A nice touch that's too often overlooked in this TV is the ability to adjust the power LED on the bottom to be turned off (as opposed to being red) when the TV is off. This is major if you want to have it in your bedroom so you don't have this red light blaring at you when you're trying to sleep.Also the power saving features are awesome. They provide a quick and easy way to adjust the heat/electricity used which is nice. Also, it gives you the option to turn off the display all together. This is excellent when using the TV just to listen to music or something. When in this mode, everything still works but the display is turned off. If you press any button it comes out, so it's not difficult to get the display back when it's been disabled.The simplink is nice, but doesn't seem to work perfectly. Sometimes it will change the input automatically to the appropriate device, and sometimes it will not. It does seem to reliably turn on when turning on a simplink connected and enabled device. It also has optical out, which is a major plus for me.Finally, I read that the viewing angle isn't great (especially vertically). I don't know if our sets are different or what, but I can say for sure my set does NOT have this issue. I get the full viewing angle, left to right and top to bottom out of this TV. At too much of an angle eventually the image will slightly darken, but usually it's at such an angle that I wouldn't even want to watch TV at that angle (talking <5 degrees angle). I wonder if maybe the reviewer had a different product, or if it has been improved since then in a minor revision (I'm reviewing the LG 42LD450)In my opinion, for the price, I couldn't have done better. I'm glad I did not go with the first choice I had because it was a bit cheaper.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "A fine TV", "Author": "Dahlia lady", "ReviewID": "R13TZYS2O1PEMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with my LG 42LD450 .

I did not comparison shop by viewing other TVs locally before I made my purchase, but I can't imagine that there could be a better picture quality: the colors are clear and realistic, the face tones are good, the picture is crisp. And, to my surprise, the sound quality is very good for a TV ...much better than I was led to expect from some other reviewers (I did not feel that I had to rush to buy a  supplemental speaker set).Because I was so pleased by my purchase I ordered a second smaller LD450 for a bedroom. That says it all !Added 5/10/2011: I do not have trouble with black \"colors\"on my LG...anything black looks black, not grey.

We even stood back from the electronics department in a few local retail stores looking for the best picture between all the sets, and to our surprise, twice we walked up to this LG TV.I do agree that after we pulled out the TV, all the pieces were a little confusing. However, the manual does an excellent job explaining how to mount the base together, and then the TV to the base. Setting up the TV was really simple and everything worked perfectly. Although this set only had 2x HDMI ports, it does however have composite video (red, blue, green), RCA (old yellow, white, red) and one coaxial connection in the back to connect your old devices. This was nice because we haven't switched to Blu-ray yet, so our old DVD player hooked up fine.I would HIGHLY recommend opening the menu and running the \"picture wizard\" as I was able to configure the coloring scheme just the way we like it. The pre-set color profiles are nice, but why not use a nice built-in tool within the menu to customize your viewing experience.I read that people had problems with the viewing angle, so I tested it out.

Unit was delivered by Federal Express in great shape, LG does a nice job with packaging their products. The price we paid was a shade under $500 with free shipping and no sales tax. In addition, I was able to get 24 month interest free financing which made this purchase a really sweet deal! After doing tons of research, reading countless reviews and seeing different brands/models (LCD and Plasma) in retail stores, I always came back to the LG 42LD450 and I'm glad I did. The 42\" size was perfect for our living room, it looked great and the picture is superb for a 60HZ LCD television. The set was pretty good right out of the box, the features are more than adequate for our needs. Standard definition was okay with DirecTV, games and blue ray movies were excellent using our PS3. I have no complaints regarding the sound, I plan to connect to a home theater system very soon. Today we received our new DirecTV HD dish and receivers for our two HD television sets, what a difference that makes in the picture on this set (Full HD) and even on our 32\" 720p Sony Bravia. The LG picture modes work great, we have mostly been watching in Cinema mode but I have been playing with the nice Picture Wizard feature to find that \"perfect\" image.I would recommend the LG 42LD450 as the one to purchase if you don't want to spend a lot, but want a set you can really enjoy. We are very happy with this purchase, you can't go wrong with this LG television. From what I can see, many people have purchased this LG television and like us, are loving it!

Dead pixels in two areas of the screen.2.  The upper right portion of the screen is brighter than the rest of the screen.3.  In spite of the plastic stripping that surrounds the frame, this TV had a scratch mark on the right hand side.Amazon is shipping me a new TV and when that one arrives I'll update this review.12/13/2010:  Update:  replacement from Amazon arrived:Got the replacement in short order from Amazon.  They handled the replacement in no time, sent one out without charging me for the replacement (the old one goes back tomorrow) and I have to say I love this TV.The quality of the picture is superb.At 1080p and 100,000 to 1 contrast ratio it's beautiful.Setup is a snap, but it takes a while to search all the cable channels.  Which brings up a point - make sure your cable box or feed is hooked up before you turn it on (but yes, you can rescan later if you wish).I also have an LG BD590 Blu Ray and both of these together are a winning combo.I paid 478.00 for this TV when I bought it.  I see the price fluctuates although that may be seasonal.  I've seen it priced up to $600.00 since I bought it.It's a steal.  I went up to Best Buy and looked at other 42 inch TV's and could not compare this side by side with other units, but my perception is that the picture on this TV easily compares to units selling for much more.Blacks are blacks without any lousy looking grays and I've not adjusted contrast or brightness at all.I'm a Comcast subscriber and the HD channels that feed from them to this TV are nothing short of breathtaking.I mounted this on the stand and it's a simple 8 screws.  The stand is sturdy like a rock.Some additional notes that involve an LG BD590 Blu Ray player and this TV:I also stream Netflix directly from the Internet from the LG BD590.  Incredible.This TV has a built in USB port so if you wanted to add an external drive to play your own movies you can.  I have tested this functionality on the BD590 (but not the TV directly) and it works extremely well (including .mkv files).  Important note:  I've had a couple of .avi's that wouldn't play due to improper audio format or the codec used in the .avi.  I suspect this problem may present with the TV as well, but these have been few and far between.  I'm thrilled to be able to play .mkv's and .avi's without having to burn them to DVD anymore.  This alone is incredible.  I love it.  I love it. I love it.Note:  Check out the AVS forum site (google \"avs forum\") and you will get the most detailed info on both the TV and the Blu Ray player.I don't see how you can go wrong with this TV, but just make sure you buy it from someone like Amazon who will take it back if there is something wrong with it like there was with my initial purchase.  You don't want to get stuck having to ship it back to someone who will double charge you or get the old back before they ship out the new one and be without a TV.  This is why I love buying from Amazon - no problems EVER on returns and the Amazon folks are always great to work with.In summary, this is a spectacular TV and the price can't be beat.08/31/2012:  Update after owning this TV for about a year and 9 months:Well, my TV died last week.  It just wouldn't power up beyond the power LED displaying a red glow.  Called LG.  Tried a reset.  No good.  I was disappointed that less than 2 years into owning this, the TV was history.  I wound up talking to an LG supervisor and guess what - they agreed to extend my warranty to cover the cost of a repair.  How great is that?  They had no obligation to do this and I've got to say that extra mile that customer service went was spectacular.  It's nice to know they are willing to do this sort of thing.  Kudos to LG for stepping up to the plate.I guess the moral of the story is it pays sometimes to ask for help - the fine folks at LG (thank you JB!) sure helped me have a good day by saving me the cost of buying a new TV or paying for an expensive repair.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Satisfied", "Author": "Trynita Romeo", "ReviewID": "R26GGFHJHQPWWR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the LG HD flat screen and am completely satisfied.

When I called Amazon by phone (a first for me), I was helped by an extremely gracious cutomer service rep who promised to deliver TV with one day shipping at no extra charge. This prevented me from running out and paying more for lesser TV at Best Buy. I will update this review after receiving television and hooking up to Xbox tomorrow.Thank you Tausha for your help. You kept me as Amazon customer pending arrival of television.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Get what you pay for", "Author": "M.

The lowest black level attainable is a very bright grey, it is very disappointing.  Scaling of SD content is also mediocre.  Throw in a limited set of connections (a third HDMI would be nice and USB is nearly inaccessible when mounted on wall) and this Tv gets 3 stars.  Would be ok for a second TV or kids playroom but if you plan to watch a lot of movies in a darkened room do yourself a favor and pay a little more for better contrast.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Missing parts", "Author": "Phrustrated Phillies Phan", "ReviewID": "R30F5DF6D803LC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Amazon.com was great.  They got the TV to me in only 2-3 days (with free shipping) and the price was much lower than other vendors.The problem is that the TV is missing parts. LG never packed the 4 screws necessary to connect the base together (exiling the TV to the box until they arrive). It was also missing the remote control and user manual. A call to LG was unsatisfactory. I was told the missing items would be sent to me in 7-10 days and they could not expedite them. LG cannot expect me to be satisfied when my baseball team is playing in the National League Championship Series and the missing parts might not arrive until the series is over.  I don't see why LG cannot expedite those parts to me when it is their fault they were not included in the packaging.  I'm starting to wish I bought the Sony I was looking at...By the way, I cannot evaluate the video, sound, etc., until I get the missing parts...  :(", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Anh", "ReviewID": "R3NLIIED7PYVGC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the TV, it has a great picture and I'm happy with it.

There was an area on the display about 1/16th by 1/2 inch in the upper left hand side that looked like a black dash when viewing any programming and the stand did not seem substantial enough because the screen would sway and sag.  I thought maybe it is isolated to the the TV I received but I know another Amazon consumer who had to return her TV same make and same model.  Amazon wanted to replace it with the same model instead of refunding the purchase price so I had to insist and they agreed reluctantly.
