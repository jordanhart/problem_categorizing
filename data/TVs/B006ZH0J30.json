Pretty good picture and sound for my girlfriends light tv use with DVDs & Roku Box.I just want to let people know that the image shown of the inputs on the back is not correct at all! Even the specifications are kind of misleading. The AV in and Component in are both on shared ports. This makes it so one can have only one Component device OR one AV device plugged in at any given time. This doesn't make any difference to my use, just a heads up to people who might need both.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect TV for smaller Bedroom or small rooms.", "Author": "LESSIK", "ReviewID": "R31LO8FWIWB2GB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to preface my review with this statement; I absolutely abhor people that post reviews of products without regard to the proper use of said products. This LG not meant for 1. Videophiles that will criticize every minor flaw in its picture and sound, 2. Large viewing area's, or 3. A top shelf LCD TV. What it's meant for: It's a budget minded, quality LCD TV that is meant for smaller rooms. It will produce a better than average viewing experience, it blows away most equally equipped brands (Hands down!). I connected the LG 32CS460 up to a Bluray player, and a cable box. I was impressed with the picture, although watching fast moving sports from a source like a cable box does not allow this TV to show its true capabilities, it looked better when it was connected to an HD antenna because their was no video tiling or motion blur, the bluray pushed the limits of the 720P TV, but you have to look really close and nitpick any flaws. The sound was more than adequate and has a few added settings that allow additional tweaking for most users listening preferences. It doesn't feature any added Apps, and thank goodness for that. I prefer my added equipment to feature the Apps, that way if it were to break it's often less painful to my wallet to replace. You can buy a decent bluray player with Apps for about $120.00, that's not even half of what this LG will cost to replace. Think of that when you spend more on that TV with App capabilities. Finally, if you are looking for the ultimate viewing experience and are shopping for a sub $300.00 TV, you are a moron(But there's still hope for you). But, if you are looking for a very good TV for a budget minded price point, this TV is going to be a hard one to beat. For my use, it sits perfectly in a teenagers bedroom. This purchase turned out so well I am going to buy another, thank you amazon Prime! I give the LG 32CS460 5 stars because it isn't a pretentious branded product trying to offer something it isn't built for, it's an honest deal at a fair price.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG is fantastic!", "Author": "tommyiii", "ReviewID": "R39Y7W7AGIESCB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality is great.

So you can imagine my surprise when I sat down to watch TV the other night and realized that I could not find anything wrong with this 32\" 720p television by LG.  This is my second LG LCD (the other being 50\") and both have amazing quality and clarity.  What is surprising is how much better this 32\" tv is when compared to the 50\".  I purchased my 50\" back in 2007, and since that time the quality has jumped up so significantly that I actually prefer to watch the 32\" that I bought at Amazon.com as opposed to the older one.

The image of crisp, sound is okay. However, lack of inputs and outputs on this TV and you need a long narrow screw driver to assemble the TV stand. Otherwise, you won't be able to screw in the bolts! I had to go out and purchase one from Home Depot. Triple XD engine from LG has had an improvement over 2011 models, including LG 32LK330. Consumers who wishes to purchase this product must understand that this model isn't a high-end product. It's more like in between mid-high and high-end. It is definitely better than any other TV products in 32inch range. I personally checked the picture quality in stores myself and it had the most crisp and accurate display of colors. People who wants to buy this product, please see the backside photo! The Amazon's description isn't correct at all!--Update: it's kinda weird but, as per LG's product description says that it is a 1280x720 resolution, when i hook up to the hdmi port, resolution is set to 1360x768. hmm... anyways, HDMI output is great.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG 32-inch TV Review", "Author": "Richard Levine \"Geek1\"", "ReviewID": "R34PPQFGTOOHAU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Provides a decent picture and sound.  I have had TV in use only for 4 days so far.  I like the idea that it has variable economy settings. It works best for me at medium. Since I have an electrical use meter, I will be checking the electrical use of this TV. The only problem I had was assembling the base. None of my dozen or so Phillips screwdrivers fit the screw head without too much slack or being able to even turn the screws. I called the customer service, and they advised that it was a metric screw. I went to Home Depot and the clerk pointed out to me that one of their screwdriver sets had a Phillips driver that fit this screw.  I tested it in the store on one of the screws, and it fit perfectly.  Bottomline was I had to purchase two more screwdrivers to add to my already vast collection of tools at a cost of about $10.  So if anyone has a similar problem, they can purchase a DeWalt 2 PC./P. Demolition Drivers set.  Set contains one Phillips and one flathead screwdriver. I have a Panasonic LED TV that I am using the LG to replace.  After a few years of use the Panasonic started the red-light of death symptom.  That is when you turn it on in the morning, it shuts itself off.  You need to plug and unplug the electrical connector to get it to play reliably.  I understand that several brands have this same problem, and that it probably indicates that the power supply needs to be replaced. I surfed the web and found the problem with most brands, but could not find the same with the LG TVs.  Hopefully, the LG does not develop the same problem.  For LG I suggest that they explain in the user manual better what has to be done to be able to use their screws to assmeble the base.  They might also consider including an inexpensive metric system screwdriver with each TV sold in the U.S. I purchased this TV from Amazon, notwithing the screw problem, everything else so far has been more than satisfactory with this transaction. I finally heard from LG customer service.  They suggested that I order replacement screws with part number FAB30016122 from [...].

I left for a 2 week business trip and before I even arrived my wife left me a voice mail saying that our old tube TV that I bought in college had died, so she was facing 2 weeks with no assistance taking care of our 2 young kids without even a TV to distract them for 30 minutes while she made dinner.  I ordered this because it was the cheapest 32\" LED TV that was prime eligible (to get reasonable overnight shipping).It was easy enough to unbox, set up, and hook up the DVD player that my wife (a very no techie) was able to do it on her own with 2 very impatient kids hovering.I wasn't expecting much for this price other than something to hold me over until we finish our built-in cabinets and invest in a nice HDTV for the living room, but I was very pleasantly surprised. This will make a great workshop/bedroom/other TV once we get the big one!  It's already a HUGE improvement in picture quality and sound quality compared to the 32\" tube TV that it replaced, but I suppose that's obvious!", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV LG32CS461", "Author": "LividLeon", "ReviewID": "R1APE5BYU136XJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Many people might wonder why is the tv getting this high rating. Let me help clear the air does this tv have the best picture and sound that I have witness hell no. Why, the price don't expect to get the best products for the cheapest price.But this tv is not a slouch you can adjust backlight, contrast, brightness, sharpness, color, tint, color temperature and other features like dynamic contrast, dynamic color, noise reduction, gamma, black levels, film mode, color gamut, and edge enhancer. There's other preset mode that you may not use because they are not really good. Vivid and standard mode are not preset but you can toggle then in the Off Av mode. I will strongly recommend to use the default intelligent sensor right true this save electricity and extend the tv baclkight by dimming it in dark area so this tv is pleasant to look at even in complete darkness and provide the best picture along with the standard picture mode. Please be advised that the sensor share the same sensor as the remote sensor so if you have something blocking the ambient light like have it in a shelf that is position in way that is blocking the sensor it wouldn't perform efficiently. The picture is great speakers sounds are stunning.Built Quality: 09/10 The screws come with washer and the stand is one of the easiest to assemble and no force required like the Samsung LN32D403 32-Inch 720p 60Hz LCD HDTV. The Power cable need a slight force to put in but there's no buckling cringing sounds that is heard when putting in the cord.Interface is simple and sophisticated. I have an approximately 15 X 15 feet bedroom and this is more than adequate. The base swivel that's a plus. It features a front panel touch sensitive button. This is good to maintain the smooth finish and not have to feel for button in the back.The major problem I have is there are no outputs I would prefer a 3.5mm output or standard analog output. I would of prefer that instead of touch sensitive button.The TV is approximately 32inch so yes you may see more grains than a 720p at a smaller since the Pixel per inch is lower when standing close to it but not a deal breaker since you don't view that close.The TV that I'm reviewing is the 32CS461 it is exactly like the one displayed by amazon with port variation.Will I recommend this as a budget tv yes.If you find areas are dark don't raise the contrast what contrast does is make dark areas darker and bright areas brighter so you can lower the contrast and raise the brightness and turn off dynamic contrast adjust black levels and gamma. If you are using it in intelligent sensor mode you can only adjust advance features so if you want to adjust normal setting you'll have to change the mode.Check out the pictures I'm passionate about this.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "gopsu13", "ReviewID": "R317JCCL638SB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great picture.

I already knew this going into buying it from other reviews, but I figured I'd state that again.  It's extremely light and pretty thin as well.  I prefer a matte screen versus glossy (which this set has a glossy screen) so just be aware that if you have a light in the room at the same level or above the T.V. that the screen will definitely pick it up.

I read the reviews and everyone was saying how it's for their bedroom or kids room but this is taking pride of place in my living room. The picture is so clear and bright and the sound is amazing. Granted we don't have surround sound or expect movie theater sounds in our living room. The only complaint I have is there are not enough connectors in the back so I have to unplug by dvd cable to re plug in my wii console. I have been told though that I can plug one of these into my cable box so it shouldn't be a deal breaker for anyone (but I have yet to find this out for sure). If you get this around $300 you are laughing because it's a great brand, a good looking slim tv with a great picture and sound quality.

The picture is very crisp, the sound isn't too bad either. The only cons I can think of are the component and AVI in ports are shared, and there's only one set, so you can only have one device plugged in using these inputs at once, and the stand is a little awkward to put together, you need a long screwdriver to get the front screws in... I just ignored those two tough to reach screws, and the TV is still very sturdy! :)I think this is the best TV on the market in this price range.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pleased!!!!!", "Author": "Mike Miller", "ReviewID": "RWZFSR7QMHZZY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall pleased with the product.

It doesn't have any svideo or vga inputs so you can't connect most laptops to it to play content or online shows, but I use my roku for most of that, haven't figured out how to stream online shows via websites yet.
