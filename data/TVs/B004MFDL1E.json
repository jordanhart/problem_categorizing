{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent TV, with a few issues", "Author": "Lawrence D. Cohen", "ReviewID": "R29XRQ5D69E4F5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, I think this is an excellent TV, but it has issues which may or may not be a problem for you.1) The picture is excellent - very clear picture, accurate color.  I have two other smaller HD TVs that are 720p, and you can see the difference compared to them.2) The stand doesn't move.  The TV sits vertically, and you can't lean it or swivel left to right.  This isn't a problem for me, but I mention it in case it might bother some people.3) The TV comes with instructions regarding set-up, but doesn't really come with an owners manual.  I think this is a point against Toshiba, but it's not that big an issue, since you can download the PDF from Toshiba's web site for free.  You'll need the manual if you want to know what the various picture size settings are, like \"native\" or \"full\" or \"TheaterWide 1\", etc.4) The sound is not good, it's rather tinny.  My smaller TVs have much better sound.  I think they should have done better here, but if you're buying a 46\" TV, you're probably hooking it up to some kind of stereo/sound system.  My stereo has good sound, so I'm not too concerned with the TV's own sound.  If you're not planning to connect this to some kind of sound system, you'll be disappointed with the sound.5) The connections in the back for audio-out include an optical/digital output (little square plug), and an analog output(RCA plugs).  Believe it or not, having analog sound output was a major selling point for me.  When I say I have a stereo, I mean just that.  I don't have a more modern Dolby 5.1 system.  I may get one eventually, but for now I want to hook the TV up to an old-fashioned stereo, which does not have optical connections.  That means I need a TV with RCA plug connectors for sound output.  Other TVs, like a SONY model that I looked at, only have the optical/digital output, so I can't hook them up.  Look out for this if you have an old stereo.6) It's an LED, so it's very thin, like less than 2 inches thick.  It's no big deal for one person to lift it.7) The price here at Amazon is $100 less than most other places are selling it for.I'm very happy with the TV.  The only thing that may have disappointed me is the sound, but my stereo takes care of that.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic for the price", "Author": "Randolfio", "ReviewID": "RH8AGEMHJBLCB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV from Fry's for an unbeatable price - $699. The whole idea behind this thing is to give you a decent LED picture at a low price point without the frills. Sound? Yep, sucks. \"Smart\" internet features? Not here. But the picture is great, and I run it through my home theater system for sound. And if you're spending over $600 for a TV, why wouldn't you? I just don't understand people complaining about the sound on flat TVs. It's like buying an iPod and then complaining that the sound coming out of the built-in one inch speaker isn't good. That's not what they're made to do... You have to plug it into decent headphones or a receiver to make it sound like it should.Anyway, this TV does exactly what I expected it to and more. It's certainly not top of the line, but it has exceeded my expectations. It is a low-power consumption LED with great picture. Aside from the sound and lack of Smart TV features (which I knew about before buying) the only negative I have found about this thing is that you can see the light from the LEDs coming from the corners when the screen is pitch black. I don't notice it when there's anything on the screen, even with black bars in letterbox, but it's there on a completely black screen. Doesn't bother me in the slightest though.I highly recommend this TV if you can get it at the right price and don't expect more than what it is designed to do.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture -- Very Poor Sound", "Author": "Goldrush", "ReviewID": "R37BFXDJKH44HB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just got it from Fry's for $599.  Very nice unit -- beautiful design, great picture, but the sound is really bad.  There is no dynamic range, and it sounds exceptionally flat -- tinny, unnatural sound.  While another reviewer says that's what to expect from a flat screen, my experience indicates that's not true, as I have 7 other flat screens (mostly Sony and Samsung), and nothing sounds as bad as this.  Since I only paid $599, I'm good with this purchase, but I'm wondering what Toshiba was thinking when they installed a 29 cent speaker in this unit -- I may call them and ask them.  BTW, when the unit was in my cart at Fry's, I checked the reviews on my iPhone and read about the sound issue, but I thought, how bad can it be?  I found out -- it's pretty bad. Thinking of adding a sound bar -- Zvox makes a nice one for about $250.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is a Great TV !!!", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R3AYRPL1WV0P9C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Toshiba for a friend of mine and let me tell you......the picture is awesome !!!

The first thing you notice is the audio, or lack thereof. This tv is unwatchable using just the internal speakers. The picture quality WAS great. If you noticed my use of past tense it's because the tv won't turn on now. It is 2 months past the year warranty, so Toshiba is of very little help. They offered to trouble shoot via telephone for $45, and nothing else. This is my first review written for Amazon, induced by frustration. Heed my warning or you'll be out $900 bucks waiting to see how much your local tv repairman will charge.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Toshiba: a swing & a miss in customer relations", "Author": "two-oaks4", "ReviewID": "R3QTE46NAWWYKS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Good & bad about this product ... but the bad greatly outweighs the good. First the good: the 46SL412U HAD a very good picture. Now the bad: this TV's main module went bad (no video) after we owned it for less than 16 months.  So it was less than 4 months out of warranty. Toshiba's customer relations would do absolutely nothing about this.  Apparently keeping customers is not a priority for Toshiba.  So they are leaving us two undesirable choices: we either pay our local TV repairman $300 to get this TV fixed ... or we scrap it & shell out at least $500 for a new TV.  Neither are good choices huh?

Who in this day and age would purchase a 46\" LED HDTV and run the sound through the native speakers anyway? The picture quality was incredible right out-of-the-box, and after calibration it was breathtaking. This is an astounding value for under $800, and stands up to my friends LED which he paid a whopping 50% more for. I'm pleased with the quantity of inputs, it was easy to set-up my surround sound, easy to calibrate, and I found everything fairly intuitive.

We had a 46 inch Mitsubishi in our bedroom, and thought it was the best ever. For many years, (30 years) we've bought nothing but Mitsubishis, which seemed to die almost uniformly at the ten-year mark, and I felt that more than fair for ten years of the best TV around. We were even unconvinced that shelling out more for a Sony was worth it.Well, that was then and this is now. Our living room Mits just died after 2 years, a DLP whose projection system fell apart and started showing broken pixels like pieces of rice all over the screen. The company offered to give us another one for an unbelievable eight hundred dollars, and it had to be another DLP, a system we'd clearly seen was inferior. We dumped it, and had to pay for the privilege since the trash company won't take TVs anymore, and bought a new one. Next, within four weeks in fact, our bedroom 46 inch Mits, not a DLP but the far superior LED type, fell apart at 14 months, with thick black lines appearing on either side and other problems.The difference being that, though we don't normally, we had cash then, and so we also bought the all-you-can-get coverage warranty from Fry's. We were assured that should it fail, it would be replaced with a product of equal or superior quality. Right.We've spent three months trying to get Fry's to honor their warranty. Constant promises not delivered, phone calls not returned, all the usual garbage. Today, they made it clear that we would not be getting another Mitz, and they stuck us with this Toshiba piece of you-know-what.Okay, the picture's not bad. Let's face it - the picture's not bad on all the new HD tvs, especially if you're not looking at one right next to another. But the sound! It's unbelievable. I swear, I have an AM-FM emergency radio in my kitchen cabinet four-inches long that has better sound. We were both just floored. So now, we either have to box the thing back up (while my husband is on chemo, incidentally) and return it and start all over, or we have to shell out for a six-hundred dollar set of special TV speakers, that will also mean ANOTHER remote (with the DVD we already have two.) We like keeping things simpler in the bedroom. This is hardly a replacement, although, seeing the price on Amazon, I know why they shafted us with it.If you already have a great TV-stereo system, go for it.
