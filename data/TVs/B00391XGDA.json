HBOhd, hd movies and boxing looks fantastic. HD channels looks awesome and will make you think you got more than you paid for. i cant say the same for SD channels, well its just sd anyways. (i heard bravia with its \"bravia engine\" improves SD qualities better than this, but idk maybe its just a sony marketting gimmick and like $250 more). sound from this tv was good enough for me, very clear. overall we are very happy with the tv's performance.  like brett favre said on his commercial \"you will pay more but you wont get more\". this tv definitely has a great balance between price and picture quality.other things  about this tv:has 3 HDMI inputs(2 back, 1 side)a SD card slot(uncommon for many sub $700 tv's, tho  i prefer having a USB port instead of this)PC inputole RCA cable inputspeakers are at the bottom.takes about 5secs to show picture after pressing power button.and oh dont get ripped off by buying those $40 HDMI cables.. $15 for a HDMI cable is actually too much.so my preliminary review ends here. i will update this in the future..UPDATE****11-07-2010****initially gave the tv 5 stars. now its 4. though personally i will give this tv 4.5 stars.(rounding it to 5 seems too much, the tv isnt perfect)the picture quality is great, i see some moments where i think the color(red) is a bit off, its just i cant seem to find the right balance in the settings. im still in the process of tweaking the settings.*****12-03-2010*****i have noticed that at times the feature \"Motion pro 4\" is better turned off. and as the other reviewer has stated, it doesnt have a 1:1 pixel mapping on 720p. and as a result of this you can only view about 95% of the picture.. it is like the tv zooms in on 720p images, so you cant see the 5% of the pictures edges.. 5% loss of viewing area may seem unnoticeable, but its not. when i noticed this its a bit surprising how much picture is lost. but with all that said im still very fine with this tv.", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love the picture, but have had problems with this TV", "Author": "JAMES E \"James E\"", "ReviewID": "R1LFLBATUI52R5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV 3 weeks ago. It was very easy to integrate it into an existing home theater set up. The picture was very dark from day 1. I found the filters in the Menu and turned them off and the picture improved nicely. But I found that everything on the screen was too green. No matter how much I fiddled with the available color menu I couldn't get the green out. I contacted [...] and chatted with one of their CSRs. He walked me through a reset of the TV that wasn't available in the Menu. It involved pushing the menu button on the remote while holding down the volume down button on the TV, then unplug the TV for a minute or so. This did reset the color in the TV and I now have a beautiful picture. A few days later the TV began shutting it self off every 3 hours. I haven't used any timers in the menu so I may have to contact Panasonic again. Panasonic was very helpful with my previous color problem so that is a great relief. I am wary of the software for this TV. I also found the Viera link through HDMI that controls linked items like a DVD player can be a problem as it can or will reset the linked item from what it was originally set to on the items remote control. I shut off the Viera link and the problem went away. I have always liked and bought Panasonic products for their reliability and quality but feel somewhat let down by the issues I have had so far.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very nice for the price- UPDATE", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "R2POMG4RFJXDII", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this to replace a similiar hitachi that I had for just a few days. The hitachi had backlighting issues where the top corners had the flashlight effect and it was very annoying during dark scenes. The hitachi did have a beautiful picture other than this one issue.This Panny does not suffer from such problems. It has a great picture, same features and very nice sound for built in speakers.The remote is very solid (compared to the Hitachi's that felt very cheap). I am very pleased with this purchase. While it's not an LED I was unable to see a difference at the stores when it was side by side, in fact,  I was forcing myself to see a difference in the LED models but was unable too.You can not go wrong with this TV. I am very picky about my electronics, especially video and this TV has a nice picture, no flaws, no bad pixels, no backlight bleeding etc. I was debating between this and the plasma's but personally I do not like the picture quality on a plasma. I know they are supposed to be superior but I find the quality to be softer than LCD. Also, on the plasma's, if you look closely you do see the screen door effect on the screen whereas the LCD's have a smooth, clear screen. This is jut my opinion and personally prefer LCD vs Plasma but Plasma has it's share of fans.edit 7/30I initially gave this 5 stars but after comparing it more and more to my other tv's and the one it replaced (Hitachi that had banding issues) the picture is a bit softer than my other HDTV's.

I got it for $675 plus a rebate of $75 and a free Panasonic Home Theater System ($200 retail value-but like getting it for $100 if I had been able to take advantage of this deal @$500). I searched for about a month before making the purchase. What put me over the edge on this one was the Consumer Reports rating and the price/Home Theater bonus. I am extremely happy with the performance. I, like some other posters, had to spend some major time in getting the picture settings where I wanted them. Once that was accomplished I could not complain about anything. Picture quality is great, black level is wonderful. Crystal clear... everything. Perfect for sporting events, gaming and HD shows/movies. Even my Roku (Netflix) has improved picture quality. Rated everything a 5 except for 2 things.

Macharia", "ReviewID": "R3E9I44KG1BRO9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like to state in my reviews that I am no expert. I am not a so called expert when it comes to AV equipment. However, I am well versed in technology and try to keep up with tech aspects. As such, I think my review would be suited for regular folks trying to get the best bang for their buck.Lets be honest. The biggest issue that people need to be concerned about when making TV purchases needs to the the picture quality. Tones and colors that are natural, not too bright and accurately reproduced for the various sources such as DVD players etc. This HDTV does just that. The colors are 'natural' and definitely up there with the more expensive units. Before buying this, I did a little research and was dismayed at the dismal rating from CNET, yet Consumer Reports gave it a nice grade. (4.1/5). It is apparent that CNET may be out of touch with things because the PQ on this TV is great. Yes, the 'Darks' are not as dark as the bezel on the TV or on a $3000 Pioneer 'Kuro' plasma TV, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad.The black levels are acceptable in my opinion. If you are looking at reviews, keep your needs in mind, as a must have feature for one may not be that important to the other.CNET also fails to take into consideration that this is one of the few TVs at this price point ($500  as of Jan 2011)that has an IPS(in plane switching) panel. Whether you sit 30 degrees from the direct front of the TV, or on the floor at a lower level from the TV. You still get great viewing angles. I think this is an important feature  especially when you have company over for games or something.Point #2. The 'viera link', similar to CEC, RIHD  or a myriad of other industry names like Anynet for samsung and so on. I have an onkyo receiver with HDMI 1.3 inputs and outputs. Viera link is not just for 'Panasonic' branded devices. I spent a little time looking at my manual and successfully programmed in my TV to the receiver remote and can successfully control both the TV and receiver simultaneously. Importance? Let's say you are done watching a movie and need to go to bed. The viera link feature allows me to use the compatible device's remote (or the TV remote) to turn off the receiver, TV and dvd player with one button. The same goes for turning it on. . I know the harmony one does this, but given the option you obviously saves you $$. This for me if by far the most important discovery so far.What else it does,well, nothing fancy really. No LAN connection, no 'apps' that stream music, and no Netflix. No worry. I have a HDMI equipped laptop and the connection is seamless. I can watch hulu and ESPN3 on HD, with a widescreen aspect that looks great. You can also stream Amazon Video on demand, and I feel that this gives me greater power and flexibility with my sources than an internet equipped TV would. Next step,get a Netflix subscription.Some shortfallsLike any other TV this one has its own issues. First, the TV does not have analog audio inputs. This means that you cannot connect your 3.5mm headphones or devices. It also doesn't have RCA audio outputs as well. Your only option is through an optical cable or an HDMI cable. Not good for those with older devices like phonographs...(lol)It has 3 HDMI inputs, one less than what I think is the industry standard. Not really a big deal, especially since my receiver has additional inputs, but if you done have a receiver, it is easy to see how quickly these can fill up. Cable box, Xbox, PS3, DVD player and laptop to name a few. Not a big deal. If its really that important, you could get a switcher, or use component cables.Swivel. The TV does not swivel on its stand. Another 'standard' feature i feel most HDTVs should have. However, like I pointed out, this TV has an IPS screen which mitigates, to a large extent, the need for the swivel capability.Overall, I am extremely happy about this purchase,especially being my first HDTV. The only reason I couldn't give the fifth star was becasue of the lask of analog audio outputs and the lack of a fourth HDMI input. Not deal breakers by any means but standard features none-the-less.EDIT** Someone pointed out to me that the review on CNET is actually from a consumer and not an 'official CNET' review.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best of what's available on Amazon, Costco, and Sam's Club right now in the under $600 range for a 42\" LCD with 120 htz", "Author": "IICAPN", "ReviewID": "R2NXK7EO6VDADK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best deal I found at Costco (around 1/5/11) was a Vizio 42\" e421a for $479 (120 htz).

The reason why is I have 2 SDTVs that just won't die (not that I'm complaining). One is a 17 year-old Proscan 36\", the other is an 8 year-old Sony Trinitron 24\". I'm not one to trash perfectly good and working technology if I can find a use for it.Anyway, I'm a big gamer. Last year Mass Effect 2 hit the stores. Long story short, I couldn't read the font in the game and didn't plan to kill my eyes doing so. The game's font had been selected with no real regard for SDTV. Could I blame the designers? Not really. HD technology isn't necessarily new and cutting edge anymore; and a lot of people have them. Did I want to go out and just grab a new HDTV for a video game? Definitely not. I did however, start watching the HD scene, doing my research and saving a little cash here and there for a year.The last few months I had my eyes on a few sets: Sony BRAVIA KDL-40EX500, Sony BRAVIA KDL-46EX500, LG 42LD520, LG 42LD550... I had very specific specifications I wanted met as well.Then, on January 7th, Amazon had Panasonic's TC-L42U25 up for \"deal of the day\" at $499. I had considered Panasonic plasma at one point and completely overlooked the LCDs. After a few hours of research, I pulled the trigger and am satisfied with the purchase.--Phew, enough back story, time for a review.Panasonic's TC-L42U25 is a 42-inch (42' screen measured diagonally) HDTV LCD. The setup is 1080p Full HD Resolution. Features include 120 Hz Motion Picture Pro 4; 24p Smooth film; three HDMI connections and a PC input.1)Picture quality -Out of the box, the picture will be bright and vibrant. First time setup is quick and easy. The settings are easily changed (in case you don't agree) through the menu.The setting options for the television are not extensive, but they aren't simple either. You'll have a good amount of control over picture display options. Turning the ambient light option (C.A.T.S.) off, for instance, may be a good idea if your television is in a room that gets sunlight but not a lot directly. With C.A.T.S. on, the back light was not bright enough with the ambient sunlight. I can see a lot of use for C.A.T.S. when viewing a movie at night on this set however.Aside from that, you will also have default programmed settings to choose from (Vivid, Standard, Cinema, Game and Custom). Select one then tweak it to your liking by decreasing or increasing the contrast, sharpness, color, etc. Color Temp has three settings of course (Cool, Warm and Normal) so you can slightly alter the overall tint of the screen.Other important settings are: Video NR, MPEG NR, and the screen format. I don't claim to be an expert with HDTVs as this is my first one, but the the first two settings I listed helped to clear up what I'm thinking were \"artifacts\" in my display while playing certain games. Very helpful as those \"blocky\", snow-like outlines around some moving images were bothersome at times.Setting your screen format to \"Full\" with \"HD Size 2\" is also recommended for the best viewing image in my opinion. Other reviewers have mentioned the missing 5% of the screen... \"Full\" with \"HD Size 2\" prevents that in regards to gaming.2) Appearance -Sleek design. All Black.The stand is oval in shape. I found this nice since I was placing the television on a coffee table with a circular glass top. A nice compliment. The stand is also sturdy and does not swivel but, the viewing angles are great thanks to the IPS Panel. So a swiveling stand is not needed. The television's buttons are on the right-side of the set as you're facing the screen (for folks that plan to mount or place the television in a nook).3) Inputs -Most of your inputs will be on the back of the television of course (2 HDMI, components, VGA, composite, etc.). The left-side of the television sports a SD Card slot (for people that want to use the set as a huge digital picture frame), a composite and a HDMI connection. The PC input on the back-side of the television was perfect for me since I want to have that option. I doubt many (if any) sets in the future will have this option since HDMI is becoming standard on newer computer video cards. PC input allows me to connect older rigs and laptops without the need to update the hardware. Great!4) Black level -The television's black level is excellent. It is not faded or washed out in the least. To top it off, there seems to be a few settings that will allow you to intensify the black level as well; making darker areas richer. The A.I. Picture setting can be turned on or off an will enrich the black/darker areas of your picture. A separate setting (Black Level) allows you to darken or lighten the screen. From quick observation, this setting alters the whole screen by either changing the backlight brightness slightly or just changing the picture brightness all at once (same thing as tweaking the brightness yourself in the menu).5) Remote control -Its a remote. I'm not picky about it as long as it works. I didn't buy the television to admire the remote.6) Response time -Overall, the response time is good7) Sharpness -Sharpness is great.8) Gaming -I purchased this television specifically for gaming and movies. I can't speak on how it handles a cable feed in any form. For gaming however, this is an excellent buy. The detail is crisp and the television delivers in regards to response, color and brightness.9) Sound quality -I do not use the television's speakers so I can't offer a honest opinion on performance. I have a separate system dedicated to audio connected. On that note, I have seen reviewers put down the sound quality of many HDTVs in general. Folks need to understand that most HDTVs don't have the room to accommodate quality speakers in their slim designs. Quality Audio is NOT what these televisions were designed for. There are other sets of equipment specifically designed for sound.Final Note --Great set! Very happy! And I can read the font no problem now!I definitely recommend this television to anyone looking for a nice gaming HDTV.Considering the specs: 120Hz refresh & 1080p, this television is really a steal at the price Amazon has it listed for (even now).

I bought this television to replace a 26 inch Sharp for my bedroom. I also have a Sharp 52\" 700un inch LED in my living room that I purchased a year ago. This television is by far the best bang for my buck. Once I set it up and turned it on I was amazed by the picture quality,  shortly there after I was mad that I spent so much on my LED Sharp. In my honest opinion the picture quality on the 42u25 is much better than my LED. After spending 2 months of non stop research and about 8 trips to Best Buy I decided to go for it. I am very happy I did. This is my first big purchase online but it will not be the last. I got the free shipping and to my surprise delivery was very smooth and on time.

IF YOU ARE USING FOR COMPUTER MONITOR KEEP THE FOLLOWING IN MIND: You will only be able to use this at 60hz, if you are buying this because you want to view 120hz for games or 3D, this is not the monitor for you. Whether you are using HDMI connection from your video card or the VGA cable, the MOTION PICTURE PRO 4 OPTION, which simulates 120hz, is grayed out, this is by design as this TV is not really meant to be a computer monitor. It does look pretty good when hooked up to HDMI and you get the full 1080P resolution. If you hook up the VGA cable, this TV maxes out at 1368x768 resolution, which is way too big for a 42 inch screen. So if your video card does not have HDMI out, forget about this as a viable option for a computer monitor. If you want a TV that will simulate 120hz as a computer monitor, the LG5300/5400 series is the only one I have seen that is capable of it using HDMI out. If you go for the LG TV, keep in mind that unless you get the 42 inch or higher set, you run the risk of not getting an IPS panel, it is a crap shoot that many have lost.  The inferior VA panels are not up to par and have horrible off angle viewing. The LG's also have back lighting issues on all sets that I have seen, from LCD to LED.If 120hz was available for computer monitor use this would be a 5 star rating. But for the price, it is an acceptable limitation. 120hz (non tv) monitors are now coming out, if you want a gaming panel this is the way to go, I believe they max out at 24 inches so far, but larger ones are surely on the way.MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CLEARTYPE FONTS ENABLED WITH YOUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM IF USING AS A PC MONITOR - it makes tremendous difference with the quality of the text.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "SOLID REMOTE CONTROL plus 120 HZ refresh rate has me sold!", "Author": "Reviewer_54321", "ReviewID": "R1KJQ40OXM15CH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a HDTV upgrade.

I compared this TV to others in its size at Best Buy and this TV had the best picture out of all the LCD's and came close to several of the LED's at a fraction of the cost. It has a very solid oval shaped base that really helps if you need to set the TV an a smaller piece of furniture.Xbox 360 output is absolutely beautiful. I can't believe the difference in definition between 720p component on the old TV and 1080p HDMI on the Panasonic. There is no discernible input lag and the increase in screen size has made distance shots in online shooters much easier to pull off. I've watched a couple of movies on netfix over the 360 and picture quality is excellent considering the source although there is a bit of judder and the framerate seems to drop occasionally. Dvds are smooth and fluid but and look pretty good considering their resolution. SD tv via the directv receiver is pretty underwhelming but I am sitting only about 4 foot away from the screen and I have seen very few HDTV's that make a sd signal look even remotely decent. Time to upgrade the receiver.The TV arrived a few days before the HDMI cables so I tried hooking it up via VGA cable. My video card has VGA DVI and HDMI outputs. If you plan to use this TV with the VGA input do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Max resolution is 1366x768 and the picture looks horrible. If you drop down to 1280x768 it looks a bit better but you have to play with the manual settings to get the screen centered and change the refresh rate to get it to stop flickering. The VGA input is very poorly implemented and basically is wasted space on a television that already has a limited number of inputs. I also tried a DVI cable with a HDMI adapter cable I had laying around. This is the way to go if your video card has no HDMI output it displays 1080p beautifully. One other bad thing about the inputs is  the  video1, VGA, and HDMI1(if using DVI to HDMI converter) all share the same audio input so the use of one of the negates the use of the other inputs.Another feature I really love about this TV is optical audio output. I have a set of surround headphones with an external amp that only excepts a toslink input so its nice to have all my audio sources unified into the 1 output.

I had heard that Panasonics performed well when it came to input lag, so the U25 moved to the top among the TVs I was looking at.  When I went to Best Buy to look at them in person, the U25's picture quality stood out.  I thought it looked better in person, especially for the price, than any of the Sharp or LG LED sets I was also considering.The picture quality is great.  I'm not a videophile by any means, but I believe the existing video modes do the job well.  I only made a few very slight tweaks.  The EEFL backlighting is also a plus, it provides the energy saving and lifespan prowess of LED without the typical problems associated with edgelit LEDs.  As far as any flashlighting or clouding, I do not have of it.  The screen itself is perfect.  It seems to do very well with motion.  To my eyes, I can not see any noticeable ghosting or motion blur.  Input lag was another area I worried about when researching TVs.  The U25 seems to do very well, especially compared to other TVs I have played on.  The sound was decent, but you can't really expect much from any flat panel these days. I was planning to buy a HTIB soon anyways.It may be lacking in internet related features compared to other TVs.

BE ADULTS AND REVIEW THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION.  CRITIQUING AMAZON'S SERVICE ISN'T HELPING THOSE WHO ARE DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT TO BUY THIS TV.  THANKS.  That said, let me get to my review.  This TV is AMAZING BARGAIN.  The picture quality is superb, but, as others have stated, the picture settings need to be adjusted as the presets just have a lot of variation.  The Motion Pro 120hz is great, as unlike other brands (Samsung and Sony, that i know of) it can be adjusted...great for watching those old episodes of Seinfeld and not making it look \"film-like and jittery\" (like my brother's Bravia).  As far as the IPS-panel goes, the color is fabulous. You want a great viewing angle?? Get this TV.  Blu-ray movies with the motion pro on look AMAZING...saw \"Dark Knight\" with Motion Pro set to \"strong\" and worked fantastic, especially during the IMAX scenes.  As far as gaming, which some have said is an Achilles heal, due to lag, I haven't noticed ANY lag on my PS3.  Now, i'm not a \"hard-core gamer\" who plays 8-10 hrs a day...but I like video games. I've played God of War III and COD Modern Warfare 2 online on this set and haven't seen any lag at all, which was surprising, esp with GOW3, with all its action. Sportscenter?? Fuggheddaboutit. Since it has an SD slot, i threw some of my Canon's pics on the TV and they were stunning...the controls are easy to use and with Viera link, you can even stream it through the PS3, but be aware...if you put a movie on the SD card, it won't play on the tv (not sure whether it has the software to play .avi or .mkv files).  Netflix HD...awesome.  Some have said the sound isn't as great as they would like, but I really haven't had a problem since my condo is small...even if it wasn't, though, i think the sound is more than adequate..its LOUD!!  The lack of a USB port and net apps is a detraction, but my PS3 fixes that problem...plus most of these internet apps are useless..my friend's Vizio has a bunch which he showed my and then laughed about how he over payed for stuff he never used.  Anyhoo. Got this the day Amazon had the gold box special, and can say this is a steal compared to other TV (although the shipping by other carriers like Pilot was a little disconcerting).  Samsung's are great, I have a 26in, but no IPS and there is some ghosting on my set that's less than a year old.  LG has IPS...but 100-150 dollars more.  And Sony TV's just annoy me for some reason...maybe its from watching all the choppy tv on my brother's set, but whatever. In short, BUY THIS TV. You won't get as much for this price.

Which is, buying a beautiful flat screen LCD TV only to have it utterly fail when it comes to playing games.I originally bought the Philips 40PFL3705D/F7 40-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV, Black.  It was on sale at a local store whose name rhymes with Fallmart.  TV looked good, picture looked good, but as soon as I hooked my my PS3 and my gaming PC (via DVI to HDMI) it couldn't hack it.  There was this terrible lag.Not in the picture but in the response to my controls.  For example, I'd push left on the analog stick only to watch my race car in Gran Turismo 5 barrel straight into a wall.  There's like a .75 second delay from inputs you make on the controller to the actual screen showing you what's happening.I know it doesn't sound like a lot but it makes gaming UNPLAYABLE.  I thought that the problem was limited to the PS3 but as soon as I tried to play Call of Duty: Black Ops on my PC, the same thing happened.  I'd pull the trigger and .5 a second would go by before my gun fired.I heard that a firmware update helped the issue some so I gave it a try.  Unfortunately, it still wasn't enough to make this hardcore gamer happy.So I took it back and ordered this badboy from Amazon (btw, it's worth using Prime if you don't already don't have it.  1 day shipping = $3.99!).Picture is great, gaming was perfect right out of the box, contrast is really good, no dead pixels.  I'm a very happy guy.Thanks for reading and good luck!PS:  Buy it already!", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R19QCSA3PCNYGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a college student, so obviously I have to stay within a budget, and this TV fit perfectly!  I had been researching TVs for about 3 months or so, and really liked this one.  Consumer Reports ranks it high (I think the score was like 71 or 72 out of 75), so I decided to buy it.  I sold my old TV yesterday (Friday) and ordered this one for overnight delivery.  It only cost me $4, and I was kind of nervous that in the process of the TV being shipped quickly for next day delivery that it would be damaged, but it is packaged very well so that was no problem!I have an Xbox 360, and the response time while playing shooters is flawless.  There is no lag associated with it at all.  The picture can be a little bright, but it isn't too difficult to change the settings.  With that being said, I wasn't expecting the depth of color controls you'd find in a top end Samsung, so this does the job perfectly (brightness, contrast, color, etc.)- basic features that get the job done for the majority of situations.  I should hopefully be getting my PS3 this week, so I'll update my review when I get the PS3 and test that and Blu-Ray out.One major drawback to this TV is that it only has a digital optical audio out- no RCA.  My older Samsung (about 18 months) had RCA out for sound, but from my research I found that newer TVs don't include this anymore, so I can't fault the TV for this.  I have a speaker system that works well, but only works with a 3.5mm headphone jack or RCA, so I needed to buy an adapter to make it work.  You'll need a digital audio to analog audio adapter if this applies to you.  The adapter will run you an extra $50-$60 depending on the quality you get, but it's a necessary evil to keep the sound coming from my speakers.The sound on the TV isn't as bad as I thought it would be from reading other reviews, but I don't use it a lot, so it doesn't matter to me. It's definitely lacking on bass sound, but most TV speakers are on the low end and tend to be pretty tingy, so although I wasn't blown away by the TV speakers they weren't terrible either- definitely tolerable if you don't have external speakers or surround sound.The picture on standard definition isn't great, but from what I know about LCD TVs, standard definition actually looks better on older CRT TVs.  Don't get me wrong, the picture is definitely fine for watching, but it's very clear the picture isn't HD, which obviously is a huge difference.  Like I said, it is definitely watchable even on standard cable.HD picture quality is amazing!  I can tell the difference between the 60Hz TVs and this 120 Hz TV, although it isn't an earth shattering difference.  Sports all look great, and so do video games/DVDs on the Xbox.  I also use the Xbox to stream Netflix, and HD netflix streaming looks fantastic as well.As other reviewers have said, the TV does have a bit of a delay when turning it on (about 8-10 seconds), but that's not a huge issue.  My Samsung took about that long to turn on, so I think it's just common to LCDs.  Going from channel to channel takes about 1 second, but doesn't negatively impact the viewing experience really.This TV is in my apartment's living room, and I'm sitting about 7-8 feet away from it.  Personally, this is towards the bigger end of what you'd want from that viewing distance, but this is subject to personal preference.  If I were any closer I think I'd have to move my eyes around to really take in the entire picture, but for as small as a living room as I have, this is a perfect size.One great thing about this is the viewing angle.  My kitchen is at about a 130-140 degree angle from the TV, and I have no problem seeing the picture from where I am.  I can definitely notice the difference from my parent's Sony (which is probably 3 or 4 years old) and this one.  I had to move even my 26\" Samsung (about 8 months old) to see from there, but not this one.I definitely recommend buying this TV.  BB has it on sale for $699.99, but it's only $550 on here.

I also bought a sound bar because of some of the reviews I read said the sound was soft. More on that later. The TV is located in a very bright room with windows and no shades. Picture quality during the day is fine, and unless it's the weekend who watches TV during the day anyway? I put cartoons on for the grand kids, it works for them. We sit about ten feet from the TV, picture quality and sound are fine for us. I enjoyed the March Madness this year and the picture quality was great. We do not watch a lot of movies so the booming bass that the younger generation is looking for is not an issue. I figure those folks would plug this set into a home sound system anyway, isn't that why there are so many for sale?We paid under $500 with free shipping from an Amazon vendor who listed it as \"like new\". We live in a rural area of California and shipping costs can be expensive and often items are damaged getting here. Audio & Video Center double boxed the set for shipment with bubble wrap around the inner set box. GREAT JOB! Although the set box had been opened, the TV appeared to have never been used, with the instructions and remote still sealed in plastic bags. As others have written the Panasonic remote is very busy and has a lot of extra buttons. It took us about two minutes to set the picture quality we both agreed on. The Panasonic default settings were good enough for us, and we put the remote in the drawer. We use our Dish Network universal remote to turn the set on/off and adjust the sound or switch the inputs for the grand kids to play video games or watch a movie.After reading the reviews I purchased a sound bar from another vendor to be delivered at the same time the TV was, I wish I had waited and tried the TV first. For us and the normal types of viewing that we do, the built in speakers work fine. For sure the TV will not rattle the windows, but in our moderate sized living room we can hear our programs and seldom use the sound bar. One nice thing about the sound bar purchase however is that we can now listen to the Dish Network music channels and do not need to have the TV on like we used to.Good customer support from Audio & Video Center.

The first thing you will notice when you unbox it is the size...  this TVis much wider than you would expect. It is a solid 4-5 inches wide, which isn't a big issue if the TV is on a table, but if you are planning on a wall mount, it WILL look a little funny.The image on the screen is wonderful, and you can fine tune the settings for your specific room.  As my TV room has windows facing the screen, I can increase the brightness to cut down on glare without washing out the black levels too much, which is quite the feat.The only downside for the picture is not a problem with this particular TV, but with all 120 Hz sets.  The higher refresh rate makes sports and video games seem like they are going to jump out of the screen, but it makes regular television, dramas in particular, look like soap operas.  It is a function of the refresh rate being faster than your eyes can notice, and it results in the picture being so clear that it seems strange, like when you flip past a daytime soap.  I highly recommend looking at one, any brand will do as long as it is 120 Hz, in a store before purchasing.That being said, you can adjust the anti-blur in the settings, going from full anti-blur to a midlevel to none so it looks like \"normal.\"  Personally, I have adjusted and think it looks better than ever, but if you feel otherwise you can have your cake and eat it too!In summation: great TV, great price.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic HDTV, 1080, 120", "Author": "Ricardo", "ReviewID": "R3B6CDBI7Q348Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice HDTV, 1080, 120, at a great price.

Interestingly enough, because of the variety in programming format, I often end up watching a raster that is smaller and sometimes much smaller than that.  Now-a-days, it's buy big, get the same. Fortunately, the format control is a dedicated button on the remote as I have ended up using it frequently.The 42 inch set, when used at full raster, is probably a bit too big for my normal seating distance of nine feet. This is most noticeable when there are scene changes which seem a bit overwhelming.  For slow moving scenes,though,it is OK.  In addition, with a large screen, when viewing non HD material, the lower quality of the picture becomes more objectionable.It is also useful to have a dedicated input button to handle all of my devices. The direct  RF input, called TV, is buried in the menu.  Panasonic must have felt that if you used a direct input from the cable or antenna that you wouldn't want to use any of the other inputs.  Other than that, the input selection button works fine.Like others, I have observed the weak audio and suspect that this was planned that way so that owners would go out and buy Panasonic home theater equipment.

This review is written 30 days after my purchase. Cut to the chase, our High end Sony Bravia just 13 months old flat died and it only had maybe 100 hours on it. Since we financed as well as bought directly through Sony, we had no credit card extended warranty and I REFUSED to spend even a penny to even consider a repair estimate. It had the nicest picture of ANY TV we ever owned in my 62 years. But $1200.00 for 13 months? Sorry, no more expensive TV sets for me, EVER.  We have 3 other TV's in our home and again, this is just for an extra bedroom to watch maybe 30 minutes a day of morning news while checking emails etc, more or less just a TV for keeping you company in the background. Now my rating is overall is 5 stars simply because if you factor in the price, I HAVE to give it 5 stars. MY breakdown is as follows.-Picture=4 stars-Sound=3 stars (speakers are on the BOTTOM front panel and fire DOWNWARD)= Adequate...-Looks=5 stars-Screen=5 stars-Matte finish=NO glare! In our room this is critical with a huge 8 foot window next to the TV.-Remote=3 stars-some features buried in menus as opposed to \"one touch\" to access. NO big deal but noticeable.-Value for Money=10 stars out of 5. THIS is how I give it 5 stars. It is a slightly above average TV for a far below average price at my paid $550.00 at Amazon.  It has infinite adjustment potential to get the picture that is right for \"YOU\". If this breaks I am out less than 1/2 of my Sony nightmare. TV sets are too subjective to get all worked up about. I may love it, YOU may hate it! So like all reviews, know that this is just my experience. You may find it a piece of junk? I have learned the lesson of my life with my last Sony. I will simply never, EVER buy a top end TV, not even for my living room. We have a much larger LCD in our living room and we now buy ALL our electronics in the following way.  We buy with a credit card. I have had 2 experiences this past year where I had used my American Express card. They issued me a 100% credit of my purchase price on a $353.00 Sony Camcorder that died in 14 months (yeah, ANOTHER SONY!), and a 100% credit on a (are you ready?) my 2ND Sony PS3 that died within 2 years! 2 PS3 systems died in under 18 months????The only Sony product I will EVER buy again is a PS3 but that's because of the Bluray player and my games. I understand the Amazon card will also protect you 1 year after any manufacturer warranty expires as well but I only trust American Express so far since they never even blinked and INSISTED I get a 100% refund! As a result, i save the money wasted on any manufacturer extended warranty since MY experience is they do all they can to weasel OUT of their responsibility an/or have about a dozen \"GOTCHA!\" Clauses to get out of paying. Use a good credit card and SKIP special interest free offers if you are able to pay off your card completely when that 1st bill comes. It gives you an extra year of FREE protection you can count on! Sometimes \"free\" financing cost you a whole lot....  Last? Enjoy your purchase that you got at an amazing price, don't sweat the small stuff, and relax since you now have a FREE extended warranty. Oh, and thank the stars for Amazon who is always there for you if you have ANY problem during the purchase or deliver process. NOBODY has a return privilege that compares, you save tax & delivery too. What's NOT to love? Remember, this is just a TV! If you don't find it to be the very best you ever saw, remember how cheap it was! And also remember, it just may BE the very best you ever saw too.....For me, it is 80% as good as the BEST I ever saw and just 40% of the cost.

Vu", "ReviewID": "R1X9J0KOU4D0XP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent about 2-3 months researching the best TV for my buck.I narrowed it down to only two that could match my original requirements. It had to be at least 40\", 1080P, 120 HZ and GOOD response time.Let me tell you that i spent nights studying specs and reviews from various websites, including Amazon, Cnet reviews and various other googled sites.I found that the Sony EX 500 came closest to the highest praises with the Panasonic TC-L42U25. However, the praises go further with the fact that the Panasonic had an IPS screen. This equates to a larger viewing angle and crisper images.I found that the Motion 120HZ was somewhat noticeable on the Panasonic. However, similar reviews stated that the EX500's 120hz motion was hardly noticeable but the Sony costed an additional $100. So it evened the score.. somewhat.My biggest priority was to have FAST response times for video gaming. I play street fighter 4 and it demands 1/60th FPS accuracy. I did find noticeable but tiny lag playing on the Panasonic on GAME MODE. However, the lag is so tiny that most other games you'll play will feel instantaneous. The tiny lag, with practice, I was able to land my combos correctly and only required me to adjust to its subtle nuance.This TV has great picture quality. But for SUPER MOVIE AFICIONADOS, if you are interested in DEEP BLACK contrasts, this TV might not be for you. It costs $550 and it handles the majority of things very well. But if you're looking for extreme contrast quality, you need to get a TV with a Contrast ratio somewhere above 1,000,000-7,000,000 such as an LED TV that brings deeper blacks.The response time on this TV is absolutely fine for 99% of games out there. If you're extremely nitpicky, you should buy a 32\" LCD/Monitor for absolute crispness. Otherwise, this TV handles 99% of all the requirements I had.Please note, there has been some reviews that during 720P, it doesn't show 5% of the picture (1:1 Pixel on 480 and 1080 is fine). I was not able to test this portion out as I assume my PS3, while watching Blu Ray, is on 1080P most of the time anyway. Where I can see that this being a problem is if your signal is 720P for WHATEVER reason, it might do this.So far I love it. It sits beautifully in my living room and replaces my old 27\" CRT Sony.GET THIS TV.

So, you can read the other reviews, obviously others also think this is a great bargain -- and it is.  This is not 3D but on a good high def show, it takes on a 3D quality, like you can reach right into the scene.It is simply amazing that such quality is available at this price point by a major brand.  I did see there is a 40 inch no name TV for much less -- my advice; spring for the extra $200 and get this.  Saw that others also commented on the higher quality of the speakers...and again, comparing to my AOC, they are excellent...and its a crime to get this and not get some form of home theater set up - they too have come way down in price, and you do not need to get a high end system.

I bought from Warehousedeals.com for $525.00 delivered (which included tax for the state I live in). The one I chose was listed as mint condition. When I received it, it was brand new never opened. Had a 10\"x1\" gouge in box only, TV had never been set up. Not bad and it comes with the 1 year manufacturer warranty.:) Before choosing this model I did alot of research. LCD vs Plasma, 60hz vs 120hz. In the end I chose this TV after weeks of confusion researching. I liked plasma mainly because of the rich colors but was worried about glare, image retention and being too dark. I liked LCD because of brightness, minimal glare, and are cheaper to repair from what I can gather. Was worried about lag, washed out picture, colors not being deep enough. Out of the box there was a kinda film on the screen. I washed it, after it dried I used a soft cotton cloth to buff off any residue and it looked perfect . I hooked up PS3 thru rca cables and was very disappointed. Switched to hdmi cable and vwala the 1080p was very impressive. I read elsewhere that expensive hdmi cable was unnecessary so I bought a cable for $15 and had no problems.The factory settings aren't very impressive. I bought DVE calibration disc also used THX calibration. If I had it to do over again I would have saved some money and just used the THX calibration, you need to get the blue film to view thru in order to set the color correctly. Once calibrated the colors are comparable to plasma and has a crisp pic quality. This model has 5 pesets that are all customizable. I only use 2, 1 for TV and movies and 1 for gameing.Settings #1backlight 85contrast  66brightness 68color  36tint  0sharpness  0color temp warmai  oncats  offvideo nr  onmotion pic 4 offblack level lightSettings #2factory settings ( haven't really set game mode up from factory settings)I use this TV for over the air broadcast channels (480i, 720p, 1080i) all are good pic quality for being thru an antenna. Connected to a PS3 I use it to watch movies (dvd and Blueray) blueray is awesome!!! I also play FPS (M.A.G.)plays perfect, no lag or artifacts that I can tell.I am very happy with this TV if I were willing to spend more it would have been a good deal for the full retail price at over $700. You wont be disappointed. Easy to set up and customize, solid colors, good performance. Sooo happy I didn't get a plasma, for my environment would have been too much glare.THE BAD, POSSIBLY Doesnt have as much brightness as others in its price range.

The daily deal was my price point, and I still hemmed and hawed for a few hours, since it still wasn't chump change for me. But my old tube TV was really dying and I decided to bite.This Panasonic Viera is beautiful. I don't have HD service yet, nor a BluRay player, nothing like that. I'm mostly watching standard definition TV (feeding through a SD TiVo, no less) on this screen until I can afford to upgrade the rest of my system, and it looks so much better than my old TV I hardly know how to describe it.My husband had fabricated an HD antennae, and we've got that hooked up to the TV as well. We get about 15-20 HD channels on that antennae over the air. The picture is mesmerizing with HD input. I've caught myself watching shows I have absolutely no interest in whatsoever just so I can see the picture. It's gorgeous.And, while I've not had need of it yet (I've only had the thing about 4 weeks), I've heard excellent things about Panasonic's warranty repair services. A friend has the same model (though a few years older), and her house was hit by lightning that didn't do much structural damage but messed with a lot of her electronics. Panasonic sent a rep to her home, fixed the TV, put all the settings the way they should be, and was as nice as could be-- all for free. She's a very crafty consumer, to say the least, and I'll admit that when she told me she'd never buy another brand of TV, I was sold on this one. And I'm very happy with my purchase.Also, to the shipping. I have Prime and could have gotten it next day with regular deliver. However with this size a purchase I needed it delivered when someone was home. I selected to have it delivered during a specific time window that I knew we could have someone home. I was able to get in touch with the freight company directly once it shipped, and they were helpful in making sure we'd have someone there to receive our delivery and it wouldn't be left on the porch at 11am when we're not home until five.

Bright vibrant picture! (Great for sports and gaming)2. 120hz Refresh Rate (Corrects most motion blur)3. IPS Panel (BEST VIEWING ANGLES ON AN LCD)4.

I posted this problem in the AVS forums yesterday, and someone told me how to correct it for 1080p:\"Click Menu, click ok on Picture ( the tv screen) go down to Aspect adjustments and change HD Size to 2.\"So now all is good at at least 1080p.

Also, it had to be 120hz ;  Don't listen to anyone that says 60hz if good enough.  There really is a large difference. Just go into a store and compare them.  the motion on 120hz is crisp and easy to follow with the eye.  with 60hz it's blurry and hard to follow.  You don't even realize what you've been missing until you have 120hz.  The tv itself is elegant, made of high quality plastic. the remote is good, made of an interesting material that has a unique feeling on your fingers.  I hooked it up to the computer, and the highest resolution where text looked good was 1280x1024, which is ok with me.  the sound actually isn't that bad if you plan to use the built-in speakers.  I have a playstation 3 hooked into it and it looks great.  Also,  I am sitting about 6 feet from it, and it's not to close at all.  it's absolutely fine.  I was going to go with 32 inch because of the closeness of use,  but then this great deal from amazon came along, and I jumped at it and couldnt be happier. I think 32 inch would have been to small now.  TO the people that say that 1080p is a waste for anything under 42 inch, I can believe it.  It seems like the finest detail is just barely visible on 42 inch, and perhaps on 32 inch it would be undiscernable.  So this is a great tv for the money,  it hits the sweet spot.  only thing it doesnt have is 3d.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Anyone figure how to set it for 120hz with a computer?", "Author": "Aerin \"aerin44\"", "ReviewID": "RR77WAXAGQ67A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought two of these to use for a dual monitor setup on my computer.

It wasn't until I played on this display that I actually noticed a difference between the Xbox 360's component cable (720p) and an HDMI cable (1080p).

With a small modification and a thin enough cable tip, one can still plug the component cable into the Xbox alongside an HDMI cable.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money!", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R2B30UKWMEOJ54", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to snag this TV on sale and it was really worth it.

I use this TV as my PC monitor. the difference between me and the other people doing this is that i use a DVI to HDMI cable this gives me 100% view of my screen. next is that i use surround sound so the tv speakers are off. In addition to that i also know how to tune the TV, so this review is from the perspective of someone with a good amount of tech knowledge.Picture Quality is amazing when you are using a full 1080 signal. watching tv stations in 720 is ok, but not as good. The black level is fantastic in a dark room you cant tell where the TV ends and the screen begins (watching something in 4:3. IPS panel gives perfect color corner to corner. To insure your tv does the same put up a 50% gray screen and see if there is any shift from center to edge. Also calibrate the monitor when its on your PC this way you get the truest color reproduction.The Remote is a joke, but its a remote who is really using that when pretty much every service provider gives you a universal remote. I still use the remote, it has some features on it that i dont thing the universal has mapped, like veralink. Also take into consideration how far you sit from your TV. I am 10 feet away so this TV is on the low end of the size to distance ratio. knowing what size tv to get will greatly improve your experience.Sound wise, ok for those not using surround sound and going with the TV speakers make sure this tv is on a hard surface or you will muffle the sound. I used it like this for 2 days and the sound was average, not good, not bad. The speakers work on the concept of reflecting the sound off a wall or TV table...oh yeah the stand, that thing is heavy. The TV has weight, but the stand really has weight.The best advise i can give about this TV is if you sit 8-10 feet from your screen, use external speakers and know how to read the manual...then buy the TV. If you have no idea what you are doing or even looking at dont bother with this TV and just go to best buy and have one of there guys help you pick (the people at my best buy are pretty good, cant say much for anyplace else.", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "C.

The picture quality is excellent with a super wide viewing angle. Refresh rate and color seems fantastic.Unfortunately it only has digital audio out via TOS Link. I have a great Logitech 5.1 speaker system that only takes an analog input. It isn't true surround sound but does a good job. I was bummed to find that it won't work. I called Panasonic to double-check there's no way to get analog video and the rep recommended an optical to analog adapter. They're not cheap and wouldn't let me control the volume from a remote so it's not a good solution. I ended up spending $225 on a true surround sound system The internal speaker is more than adequate but I'd prefer a little more oomph.I connected my Mac Mini via HDMI with an adapter from the video port  so the HDMI cable doesn't carry the audio. The settings let you pick an alternate audio source so I plugged the sound into the RCA jacks for composite Input 1. This was really nice because none of the HDMI ports have a dedicated analog input option. It means you'll lose an analog video input but there are plenty to go around (2 composite and 1 component in addition to 3 HDMI). I was really pleased that this worked.I have a couple of other minor quibbles but they're far from deal breakers. First, the power light is off center on the front of the screen. It's kind of annoying. It also has the word \"power\" printed on the bezel, which isn't really needed and seems kind of stupid. What else would that light that's only on when the rest of the set is on mean? It also has a blue gradient on the bottom of the bezel. It looks like a reflection in the picture but it's actually painted on. It seems kind of tacky but isn't that big of a deal.It's a shame it doesn't have analog out for folks without a real digital receiver but otherwise this is a fantastic TV at a killer price.
