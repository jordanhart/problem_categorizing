{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Viewing angle problems from bottom and sides", "Author": "SteveAnselmino", "ReviewID": "RXNUH6D7GOEVL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I compared this TV up against two other similar competitors:  The LG 26LS3500 and the Samsung UN26EH4000.  They're all 26\" LCD TVs, and they're all within about $60 in price.  I had a chance to see all three TVs side by side, and there's one striking difference:  The viewing angles.  All 3 TVs have a very good and similar looking picture straight on, but the Philips looks awful when you get past about 45\u00b0 from the bottom, or about 60\u00b0 from either the left or right sides.  It's a pretty dramatic difference compared to the other two TVs.  I was planning on mounting this TV high up on a wall where it would be viewed from both straight on, as well as from below (when you're up close to it).  When looking up at it from below, all the colors are completely reversed!  Even at a 30\u00b0 angle from below, the colors already start to shift.  It doesn't look nearly as bad from a high viewing angle, but since many people may be planning on mounting a TV like this high up on a wall (like in a bathroom or bedroom), you should know that there are other TV options for just $30-$60 more that would be a much wiser choice.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture", "Author": "Tracer McLeod", "ReviewID": "R2FOKZ902SXZIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The packaging for the TV is minimal but protects the TV smartly.

I have used it primarily as a computer monitor with my laptop through HDMI and it works very well. The screen is bright and clear and the size is pretty much ideal to sit on my desk in front of me. I would not recommend this as a main TV but for a bedroom or monitor it is excellent for the price.Pros-Clear, bright picture-Price-Ease of use (settings, remote, etc..)-Connectivity (3 HDMI, PC, Component, RCA)-Stand is solid and has decent weight to it-There is NO LIGHT from this TV at all when it is off- no standby light- and only a small white light when it is onCons-Backlight causes a band at the top that is either brighter or darker then the rest of the screen depending on how it's set (keeping it at the midway 10 prevents this)-As previously mentioned this TV has color/brightness issues when viewed from belowUpdate October 7, 2013While I had some issues which I mentioned before I must say I am very happy with this TV. The price was a little steep but I have used it for many many hours (avg. 10+/day nearly every day to the tune of 3300hrs+ total) hooked up to a PS3, Laptop, and Satellite TV and there has yet to be a problem. The TV is bright as ever even with the back-light on medium and the remote survived a trip though the laundry. I recently hooked up HDTV to it and it is beautiful. This screen is best viewed from 4-8ft back (4.5ft being optimum for the size) within 45* in all directions except below.As long as you can stay close to straight on in front of it this is a great screen. If I needed another TV I would buy it again simply for the reliability I have gotten not to mention it's very bright and clear picture.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect...", "Author": "Bruce Allen", "ReviewID": "R3CA9U1NKGHQJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted this for my bedroom and it is just right for it.
