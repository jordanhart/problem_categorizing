{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Basic TV-HiDef when using QAM tuner", "Author": "M. Keough", "ReviewID": "R2W91315GDFV6N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV is pretty good out of the box, and has more picture adjustment controls than I expected.  I like that the TV can be tilted a few degrees up or down. (others have no tilt feature)The sound is rather poor (tinny and no bass), but you can always hook it up to a cheap pair of PC desktop speakers through the earphone jack if you need richer tones.When I first hooked it up to my cable connection, through the coax connector (TV input), it only searched for the few low resolution (480i) Analog channels that my cable company provides.  I was disappointed until I realized that you have to switch the tuner to \"QAM\" mode and get the activation code from Westinghouse (free).  After QAM activation, it found all the digital channels.  The high def (1080) cable channels look much nicer than the 480i analog default channels.  There's no mention in the manual that QAM is the digital tuner needed for Hi-Def channels.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the TV.  It's good for a kid's bedroom, kitchen or use as a big computer screen (has analog PC RGB and HDMI input).  When using as a computer screen there's an auto adjust and full manual control over the overscan size in case it's too big from the PC.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "fantistic little flat-screen", "Author": "Clyde D.

This is the first \"slim\" design TV that I have bought.  The sound is awful, and that is exacerbated by the fact that in order to accomplish the \"slim\" design, the speakers face to the rear.  SO, the person in the next bedroom is hearing EVERYTHING on the TV. Also, with the sound bouncing off the wall behind the set, the volume level must be quite high... mea culpa to the next bedroom.  It seems to me that makers of TVs from the large screen TVs to the smaller screen TVs want us all to buy video sound components or sound bars.  So much for the price of TV's going down.Otherwise, the picture quality is good and the features are good... I wish it had a second HDMI input jack so I can run my blu ray and my ROKU, but I worked it out.  It wasn't an expensive tv, but by just having FRONT facing speakers, it could be a lot better... jus sayin...", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Picture, Mediocre sound", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "RT1SB96D44ZV9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really like the tv but the speakers in it rattle if you get into a movie or show with big sound.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent TV - considering the price", "Author": "KailuaKate", "ReviewID": "R37Y5QFBYZ63IM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV and haven't used it much but thought I would report my initial thoughts.  I purchased this HDTV mainly because of the price ($149). I bought it to replace an old 13\" Toshiba analog TV in my kitchen. It definitely isn't \"plug and play\" when it comes to using it with cable.  I had to change the setting on the tuner to QAM and then enter an access code (14159).  It took about 10 minutes for the TV to complete the channel scan.I had to connect the TV using the coax cable jack because when I hooked it up using an HDMI cable it couldn't find a signal. I had hoped that once it finished scanning the channels this would be corrected, but it still isn't working.  I guess I am going to have to call Westinghouse to figure it out.But, so far, I am pleased with the picture.  I am having some sound issues (volume) but I think that has more to do with my cable than the TV. As for other's reporting the it sounds \"tinny\" here is what I did - I went into the sound menu and selected \"user\".  I then increased the bass and decreased the treble.  I think it sounds great now.I am planning on buying a second one from Amazon for my sister for Christmas, if it keeps working as well as it is now.UPDATE:  I had to call Westinghouse about the HDMI problem and it appeared that the HDMI connection was broken (tried connecting the cable box and a DVD player).  I wasn't happy about this because the store I bought it from is over 100 miles from me (that will teach me to not be impulsive - I should have waited and bought it here).  If I had to send it to Westinghouse, I would have gotten a refurbished TV in return - again, something I wasn't happy about.  After hanging up with tech support, I decided to try connecting my ROKU box - and it worked!  So, I'm hoping that when the cable company technician comes out today he can get the HDMI working with the cable box.", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "lcd-2240 22\" Class/LED/1080/60Hz/HDTV", "Author": "Ezra J.", "ReviewID": "RNL6N1F3UYY8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My niece and nephew are tickle pink over this commodityThey love it to death the envy of there block", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "Marlene Moore", "ReviewID": "R18NQQCLWKRAFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with this purchase!

Shirrell \"Zalmanian\"", "ReviewID": "R1WL50LR603GN8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "All I needed was a cheap little TV. So I bought one.  When I set it up I was disappointed with the sound but not surprised, it is a cheap TV after all. It was adequate for what I needed. After three or four months it began turning itself off.  At first it was an occasional event.  Found out it was likely related to the power supply and just shipping for warranty coverage would cost more than it was worth to me.  Now it will stay on for a few minutes at best, generally a few seconds.  I've owned lesser quality electronics before and have endured compromised sound and picture, but I've never had this problem.  Apparently this is not an unusual problem for Westinghouse. I'll avoid Westinghouse products from now on.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Mixed With Awful", "Author": "jawarrior", "ReviewID": "R3BRN1DSQLQQYW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The excellent?:It's low-priced, lightweight, portable, LED illuminated, full 1080p HD and a great size for a 2nd TV in a bedroom, office or work area.  The picture is really quite good, and stays pretty good even at moderate angles to the screen.The awful?:The speakers make a 1950's Studebaker AM radio sound like a Bang & Olufsen home theater sound system.  They are so crappy I can't find words negative enough to describe them!  Imagine an old Japanese transistor radio stuffed into a coffee can, and that would sound better.  Another awful aspect is that it doesn't even swivel.  The stand is fixed - but not so fixed that it won't allow the TV to sway badly when you walk near it across a wood framed floor.  I think the post must be made of gummy bears!!  Finally, the stand allows the screen to slant downward ever so slightly.The Redeeming Facts:I have an old set of computer speakers with a subwoofer which I plugged into the TV's headphone jack.  If you turn the TV volume control down to 50%, and then turn the volume of the speakers to a point well above normal listening level, you can then control the volume of the speakers using the lower, distortion-free range of the TV's weak audio amplifier and end up getting really fine stereo with great bass!!Also, since I'm using it in an area where I won't need to swivel it anyway, that shortcoming doesn't affect me.  It weighs almost nothing, so turning it is pretty easy even without a swivel feature.  And, I'm keeping it atop my tall clothing armoire, so the very slight downward tilt is a good thing, actually.Conclusion:In a nutshell, the excellent far outweighs the awful for me.  Great picture, low price and enough connectivity to accommodate a DVD player and a powered speaker system make this Westinghouse HDTV's failings fade away.  Now that I've replaced my failed old tube TV, I can fall asleep to the sweet sound of Hannity's endless rants in glorious, bass-filled stereo from my wonderful new Westinghouse LD-2240 1080p HDTV.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything worked... except for the TV part", "Author": "Trevor S.", "ReviewID": "R2PUTR539SUVZH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this set off of Groupon to use for PC/Xbox/Television. It fit very nicely on my desk. Setup was fairly simple, and in no time I was playing on my pc and Xbox. But that was it.I get my television service from Cox. Nothing fancy, just your basic cable. The cable was plugged directly into the TV, I don''t have a cable box or DVR (also to note, the way the imputs are placed on the back of the tv can make it difficult to plug in anything that's too bulky). I saw all the reviews mentioning the QAM code (that whole code-to-scan is quite frankly redundant and annoying) but it never came up as an option on my set. I called customer service many times, but to no avail.I am going to return this set and look for another. Every aspect of this product worked perfectly, except for its primary function. Perhaps you must have a cable box, I'm not sure. I have two other tvs (a clonky tube and a somewhat new flatscreen) and they can scan all my channels.

I bought one because it cheap. Then I got it home and tried to make it work and realized why it was so cheap. The very first impression I got was that the batteries for the remote were dead (actually bloated). I put new batteries in the remote and sometimes the tv would recognize the buttons I pressed on the remote and sometimes not. I started going through the setup and got to the point where the tv wanted me to give it a tuner activation code. What the eff? It's a TV and I can't even use it without going on line and activating it? I followed the instructions to get a activation code and the activation code wouldn't work. I tried multiple times then called the customer service number to get help. They gave me the exact same activation code that I had already tried multiple times. At this point I was already invested in for over an hour trying to get this thing to work. It's a TV. It should take 10 minutes MAX to unbox, set up and be watching. At that point I boxed the POS back up and took it back and exchanged it for a Samsung. Do yourself a favor. Spend the extra 50 bucks and buy a Samsung.

We went to P.C. and got a COBY LEDVD2396 23\" LED TV.  Connecting it at home was an instant disappointment.  Since we have cable TV and our 2 cableboxes are not HD I had to connect it via the coaxial (75 ohm) connection.  We have our cableboxes routed to switchers so that the connection to our individual TVs is through the switchers' 75 ohm connector.  The COBY produced a less-than-ideal almost monochrome picture and no matter how many adjustments we made nothing helped.  So we decided then and there to return it first chance.  Hurrican Sandy prevented us from venturing outside so we had to watch this awful TV.We finally returned to P.C. and my wife zeroed in on a Westinghouse LD-2240 22\" LEDTV 'cause it had the best display among the other TVs on the shelf.  We noticed that all of the TVs were hooked up to component cables hence the beautiful pictures.  We asked the salesman what the reception would be like using coaxial and he said it wasn't the best.  We had to find out for ourselves and were surprised when the Westinghouse delivered a superior picture to the COBY even with a 75 ohm or coaxial connection.  It was a keeper.Then we became aware of its other shortcomings and the main one is that the headphone jack is on the back and difficult to access!  The row of buttons is also on the back towards the right edge and they are tactile and you have to train yourself to know which button does what if you can't find your remote.  Worse, our cablebox remote manual had one code for Westinghouse and after programming the remote we found that her remote affects my SONY's channels and volume!  Her aim is all over the living room so once in a while I have to retune my SONY TV!  The sound from the TV's speakers are not full-range and the volume is anemic.I learned about the QAM tuner activation.  I went to the Westinghouse website and at the boxes where you enter the TV's Serial No., I got the numbers from the box stickers but they were rejected!  So my wife has to call Westinghouse support and get some hopefully helpful answers.The TV's display is nice and sharp and connected to the proper cables (HDMI or component cables) it will produce a very satisfying picture.  If you have only a coaxial connection, be ready for a slight disappointment.  And if you want better sound connect it to an external amplifier and speakers.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Speaker Sound Hurts my Ears!", "Author": "NJ Night Rider", "ReviewID": "RZXDAXA8Q5SNX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought Elsewhere ** RETURNED TV ** .... momma mia!

As a result 1080i signals look wonderful on this TV, and having 1080p resolution means this TV could also be used as a computer monitor which is a huge plus.The only negative is the weak sound, but to be fair many TV's these days are getting slimmer with smaller speakers.
