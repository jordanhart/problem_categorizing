I guess it's more of a semi-gloss, but definitely less glossy than a full gloss screen.)))I'm using this as a computer monitor, not so much as a TV, but I do watch a lot of Blu-Rays and TV shows on Netflix.I just upgraded to a larger living room, and my old Samsung 46\" CCFL-backlit LCD did not cut it. I couldn't even read the text on the screen when browsing the web. So I drew up some diagrams, did some trigonometry, and decided that I needed at least a 60 or 65\" TV. Being out of the TV market for several years, I didn't keep up with all the new features and marketing lingo, so I visited a few big box stores to get information on what all of this new \"Smart\" features, CMR, micro-dimming, etc. Turns out CMR is just a combined rating of processor speed, micro-dimming, dynamic contrast, and other various stuff. Apparently micro-dimming on Samsungs is all software. Why? Because these babies are all edge-lit. They don't have \"real\" local dimming, only \"fake\" local dimming. That guy working at best buy telling me he could tell the difference between the non-fake microdimming and fake microdimming screen? Ridiculous. All that fancier faster processor does to get you the higher CMRs is make the fake microdimming and automotion plus feature work better. I'm the type of guy who turns this stuff off completely.The 6300 doesn't come with the smart remote, which is a bummer because I rather liked that feature. But I wasn't going to pay 400 extra to get the next model up just to have the remote. In fact, I like the 6300 model more than the 6400, 7100, 7500, or 8000 because of the matte screen. I have a window right behind me, and from various angles other windows coming from the sides, so not having nasty reflections on black screens (or anything that happens to be black on the screen) is a big deal to me. I just don't like seeing my own face in the middle of a movie.The menus are very slow, and you have to point the remote directly at the TV, or it will not register your button pressing.From consumer reports, I'm told that these LED-backlit models don't have great viewing angle. I disagree. There seems to be very little distortion at 45 degrees away from center.I don't like my color settings to be vivid, natural, dark, bright, contrasty, dim, or anything other than \"accurate.\" So, I googled some calibration settings to 6500K, and after going through that process the picture was... pretty darn good. In case anyone was interested, they are posted below. \"Movie mode\" apparently changes the color temperature model / white balance mode to 6500K, and from there you can adjust the other settings.Compared to the high end Panasonic Viera plasmas, this LED-backlit model seems much brighter. Compared to the Sonys, it seemed to have fewer artifacts. Compared to the LGs, it didn't have as much reflection. Or maybe I'm just biased.Oh, also apparently this 65\" model only uses about 82 watts. I haven't verified this with my meter yet, but my old 46\" used about 150 watts.

Cowen", "ReviewID": "R3J9RW7QF9WJE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class. I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. This TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of this TV:With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "CONSOLE GAMERS!!! this is the PERFECT TV!", "Author": "Patsfan", "ReviewID": "R1LARE8EQR1KUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first review on Amazon and I normally dont do this, but I feel compelled to write one because most of the reviews on this fabulous TV are missing a key Demographic...GAMERS!!! Skip down to the 2nd paragraph for gaming if you dont want to real this background paragraph. To start off, I purchased the Samsung UN46F6300 46 inch LED TV solely for the purpose of Video gaming, but also for streaming Netflix and Cable TV. With the new XBOX One coming out I knew I had to upgrade from my Dynex 40 Inch LCD TV I purchased before I went away to school in 2009. I did a lot of research and was split on buying an LED TV that was either 120 HZ refresh rate or 240 HZ. After learning that the human eye can barely tell the difference between 120 HZ and 240 HZ I decided to go with 120 HZ because its cheaper and the technology is better developed than 240 HZ. Long story short, I researched brands endlessly looking for that \"flawless\" TV, and came to the conclusion that my first LED TV is going to be a Samsung. I was then split between the Samsung UN46F6300 (this model) and the Samsung UN46F6400 which is the 3D version with 480 Clear motion rate. After consulting on CNET, my most trusted electronic website, there is no difference between 240 CMR and 480 CMR because they both have an 120 HZ refresh panel. Thus, the decision was made, and Ive been mind blown ever since.GAMERS, This is dedicated for you since no other review gives a good description for gaming and this is what I was looking for when researching for TVs. Let me start off to say that this TV does require some fine tuning with the picture to give you that perfect clear, crisp look Let me also point out that there is NO MOTION BLUR which fascinates me because it gives you that lifelike realistic picture. Everyone is different so I suggest you play with the vast amount of picture options to best suit your needs. I highly, highly! recommend turning the game mode on if you plan on playing online multiplayer because the input lag is right at 30 millaseconds (MS), which is top tier. Why does this matter? Say your playing Call of Duty Black Ops 2 and all the sudden you see a guy and you pull the trigger. you unload endless rounds of your Lsat into him but he shoots two rounds from his MP7 and kills you....HUH?? this is because of input lag. While your gaming console instantly registered the trigger pull (shots), it took the TV MS to recieve the game's actions, IE: you being shot at. so even though it seemed like he only shot 2 rounds he actually shot more, but since your tv is running difference processes it slows down its processing speed, thus causing input lag. so ideally you want a TV with low MS as possible for gaming. with game mode turned OFF, this TV is running at about 120 MS so, you only need to turn the game mode on when your playing online. TO ACCESS GAME MODE: press the MENU button, select setup, then select GENERAL. Game mode will be on the top and you can turn it ON/OFF. Then adjust your Picture settings accordingly! When I am playing a single player game on xbox 360, (skyrim, mass effect) I am truly amazed by the graphics this TV produces. This picture is on par with the graphics of games shown at E3. I expected it to be good, but not this good! Again it does require some fine tuning.I have read some reviews on the smart features and have noticed a slightly unhappy trend with the functionality. My wireless router is the next room so I havent had a single problem connecting or bad picture quality when streaming on Netflix and Youtube.In Summary, if your looking for a great all around LED TV specifically for gaming, this is your winner. you will not be disappointed. Please read the other great reviews for better detail on the picture, sound, smart tv functions. Thanks!*12/6/13 UPDATE*Ok now that I have the Xbox one (the reason I purchased this tv), playing battlefield 4 on this tv is visually Breath taking. The graphics fantastic. I have spent a couple months tweaking my display settings on this tv so If you would like my calibration settings for this tv on game mode let me know! It's been about 4 months now and not a single issue with this tv! The wifi connection still works great, the apps function properly (netflix), and I cannot repeat enough about the fantastic picture quality!  I would recommend to Samsung a better TV remote though, the numbers/letters on the buttons are beginning to fade. Please feel free to ask questions, I'll try to respond quickly!", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great screen, Smart TV awful", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R3IDH41P43W034", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "UPDATE: Audio issues started to creep up with all apps regardless of settings. I have since returned this TV and got a Panasonic Plasma + Roku.To address posts about it being my connection, I have 25mbps down, none of my other devices had the issue, am not using any receiver to pass through, and the problems disappeared when I started using a Roku instead (imagine that?). I am not the only one that had Smart TV issues with this. It could have been a bad TV but I wasn't going to gamble on another one.-I got this TV because of the pretty good reviews. LED, Smart TV, and 46 inches.If you are here looking for why I gave this 2 stars: If you are like me and wanting this TV to be an all in one stop shop for streaming video instead of a set top box (Roku, GTV, ATV) DO NOT PURCHASE THIS.The picture is great; colors, blacks, everything. The 240hz motion view thing is interesting, it really makes things look smooth, but it's really odd looking. It gives everything a soap opera-ey effect. However, looks nice for animated shows.My biggest gripe is the Smart TV portion, which is one of the main reasons I bought this TV.It has Netflix, Amazon Video, Plex, pretty much the main 3 things I want. Perfect, and dual core, should have no issues! I figured I'd get this instead of a lower model without Smart and similar features and pair it with a Roku. Mistake.I have come to the conclusion that either the TV's processor cannot handle 1080P AT ALL (What Netflix labels as SUPER HD) streaming or there's some sort of software issue with the apps. The Netflix app is one of the bigger culprits. The audio is out of sync most of the time. The sound will also cut out randomly for anywhere to 2 seconds to minutes, the picture will continue to go but no audio. Doesn't matter wired or wireless, same result. Non-HD will play just fine, although it's a waste of potential given this is a 1080P screen. Googled it to find it to be a common issue, sadly. Which I honestly can't believe considering it's not hard to playback HD video in this day and age (Come on, my phone can do 1080P). This is what I'd expect from a Pentium 4 processor.However, after more thorough testing I have discovered that the 5.1 sound on Netflix is the culprit of the audio issue. The only work around I have found is changing the sound to Stereo, manually. Also you cannot change your default audio, it defaults to 5.1 for anything that has it. You will have to change it per video or if you exit out of the app, you will have to change it again. On Netflix's site it does list 5.1 as supported for this model, but for some reason this Samsung TV has trouble with it. Although this is a work around, it's a pain in the butt to have to change it constantly for something that should work.EDIT 8/2/2013: After trying other shows for a while, I have discovered it's not just the 5.1 sound channel. I have started to get the issue on a lot of different Netflix TV series even with the Stereo audio channel. I have returned this TV.I've tried everything there is from Wired to Wireless, updating firmware on both the TV and router. All my other devices have no trouble streaming, just this, but figured on being thorough. In other words the primary reason for getting this was pointless.Also one of the parts I find that sucks about the Smart TV is: if you power off the device and power it back on, it will not go to the last place you were at. In other words if you were on Instant Video watching a video, then power off you will have to start out at the channel screen. Then you have to go back into Smart Hub, back to Amazon Video, Find the video, resume playing.Which brings me to my next gripe, the speed of the apps. The process I just said [Amazon Video from channel screen] took (I timed, 1 minute 5 seconds). Netflix App is a little faster, but doesn't work properly so it doesn't matter. All in all I should of saved myself a lot of money by getting a lesser model with a Roku. Contemplating sending it back, but it's such a huge hassle with such a large item. I guess I'll decide this week. I hate to say it but this is sort of a disappointment.TLDR; The TV has potential, but due to the current state of the apps/hardware, it's just not worth the money.[Also a side note I just discovered: the Plex App does not support such things such as internal MKV subtitles (only basic external ones), which negates a lot of my library.EDIT: After talking with the Plex Samsung developer you have to enable 'Force local transcoding' and 'force subtitle transcode' to get this to work.]", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review includes help for network issues", "Author": "Pilchard", "ReviewID": "R3BE92XEXZYUHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, the screen is glossy. Anyone buying this set should know that. If you have a very well lit room, natural or artificial, glare may be an issue. Most people buying this set (including myself) are or should be aware of this. As such, there is no point deduction for the glossy screen. Which by the way renders very beautiful and crisp images.Second, the Samsung UN55F6300 (likely all 6300 class Samsung's) is complex. Essentially you have a computer inside the set, which is able to run an app store, applications, and various functions (including a browser, support for keyboards, mice, etc) which often is associated with a computer of some sort (laptop, tablet, PC). The computer is not very fast, it has a graphical interface, and works well for the functions it provides. Total storage for apps and data seems to be about 1.5 GB, which I'm guessing is something like you'd find in a memory stick. It is fast, and lasts across power cycles, even if unplugged, the memory remains in tact.Associated with your Samsung smart TV will be an account on Samsung, to enable loading, and potentially purchasing apps. Also to register your product for warranty coverage. The set has great Wi-Fi and wired Ethernet capability. Generally I prefer wired, but the wireless features on this set are strong.Applications include Amazon streaming, Amazon cloud player, Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube, a media player, a plex interface, DLNA, and many other functions. Many news stations (mostly local Fox stations seem to have apps at the Samsung store, this gives news shorts from various larger cities).Special note about the Amazon app, it is the best Smart TV Amazon app I have come across yet. My smart TV's include 2013 and 2012 Panasonic sets, a 2011 LG, and an older 2010 Vizio smart set. The Samsung Amazon app, lets me look at my Amazon watchlist and also lets me see recently viewed content. This makes the Amazon interface on Samsung very friendly, the watchlist functions as a favorites, the recently viewed lets me finish stuff later without having to search for it.There is a sophisticated interface with DirecTV, which while interesting, I elected to ignore. As learning to use Samsung's interpretation of the DirecTV video guide seemed like spending energy for little benefit (other than having a single remote for both, which doesn't really run DirecTV DVR's well). There is an extension cable which connects to the back of the set, and can transmit IR signals to a set top box (satellite, cable or other). Some may find this very useful, others not, though it's nice to have.Set up out of the box, is relatively easy. A large area to place the set face down (I used a bed) and to attach the stand was very easy. 4 screws to attach the base to the mount, and 4 screws to attach the mount to the back of the set. The remote uses 2 AAA batteries which are included (alkaline).On initial set up the set will likely want to run an update after network connectivity is established, this can take a while. I did this as it seemed reasonable, just be prepared to wait a few minutes. The set lets you set up an account at the Samsung Smart Hub store, I advise against this as the password rules at the store (via a web device) are different from the rules on the Samsung web site (the set lets you use 6 letter passwords, the web based Samsung Smart Hub store requires 8 letter or more passwords, and only works with 8 letter or longer passwords).The remote is a bit small, people with large hands may find it a bit difficult at first. After a while, even with large hands it was easy to get used to. It's a bit long, and narrow, buttons are somewhat close together. The remote has a backlight capability, which is helpful in a dark room, though it could be a bit brighter for my taste.Overall, I'm very pleased, the set is thin, light weight, has a great base, fantastic display, and many smart capabilities. If there were one downside it would be the bundled speakers are a bit weak, somewhat weaker than other sets I've used (Vizio, LG, Olivia, and others). The set has many preferences for color, light intensity, and various \"eco\" features, many forums discuss combinations of settings and features which work well together.****The above is my review of the set, and is intended for most viewers. A coda is being included for those who use Vizio or Amazon support.When I first connected my set, my network setup was successful, it indicated full Internet connectivity was functioning. It was possible to install firmware updates, the browser worked, I was able to order free apps from the Smart Hub store, and all seemed well.Unfortunately it was not. When attempting to launch any app (except for the browser and Smart Hub apps) the set returned \"Network error_code_02). Which is a bit cryptic. I later found this isn't directly a network error, it indicates an app which was purchased and has an icon on my set, hasn't yet been installed.This caused me to try Samsung Tier 1 support. Tier 1 was nice, friendly, and sounded as if she was based in the United States. She basically went through set up several times, tried to assure I was connected to Internet, and was unable to solve my connectivity issue or tell me what error_code_02 was.Later, I called Amazon support, which offers 30 days of support for new TV customers. Amazon support was if anything more enthusiastic about helping me than Samsung, and was slightly more knowledgeable than Samsung tier 1 support, however they were unable to help directly. However Amazon got me in touch with Samsung remote support.Newer Samsung sets, have an ability to allow Samsung representatives to come into your set. An 8 digit code is generated when you enable remote access, you must provide this to Samsung remote support and they can operate your TV remotely as if they were in the room. Note, it appears if you have video, they can see and hear what is in front of the set. Be careful to not have anything you wouldn't want a stranger to see in front of the set.The remote support gentleman from Samsung was the most knowledgeable and helpful about this set. This shouldn't be a surprise. He ran the same set up / initialization Samsung Tier 1 and Amazon support had me do. He had me try wireless, and various access points.He indicated his speed test indicated my TV was connecting to the Smart Hub server at less than 1 megabit per second, which he said was too slow to stream. He eventually thought the problem was related to my router configuration, and suggested opening ports on the router.I'm not a fan of opening my firewall or NAT via fixed rules. My router was an ASUS RT-16 running Tomato USB firmware (a Linux variant). I've never had to open up any ports for any product before, we have tablets, smart phones, Xbox 360's, PS3's, PC's and other smart TV's, IP cameras and other things which have never required ports to be opened and directly routed to the set.In desperation I tried to connect my TV via a router feature called DMZ, and the TV still couldn't connect to the Samsung Smart Hub to install apps.This surprised me, as DMZ (sometimes called demilitarized zone) usually sends all internet traffic not directly handled by the router's NAT to the DMZ device. As such, I was hoping the set would operate as if directly connected to my cable modem.When DMZ failed, a long Cat 6 cable was used to directly connect my Samsung TV to the home cable modem. This cut out all other internet in our home, but gave me a chance to see how the set would work without any router in the way.Surprisingly once my router was out of the way, my Samsung set worked fine. Everything zoomed through. This of course meant there was a problem with my router.Later on a router forum, I discussed this, and it is possible some routers with a feature called stateful packet inspection (abbreviated as SPI), may have issues when some flags are used on packets. The issues cause errors either in SPI or in error checking that can cause good packets to be marked as bad. Bad packets or SPI violative packets are rejected by the router. A trace of the communication was provided on the forum, and it appears my router was rejecting packets from Samsung's Smart Hub server.I tried a different router (TP-LINK TL-WDR3600), running different firmware (DD-WRT) and my Samsung UN55F6300 had no issues with the Smart Hub service, it was able to install, and uninstall, and easily use the Smart Hub function without issue behind my router.Samsung and Amazon were unable to diagnose my router issue, Samsung indicated my speed to their server was under 1 megabit, but it was probably zero bits per second. Samsung left me, saying that eventually the apps would load (neither Samsung or Amazon were able to determine there was an issue with my router, or what it was). This indicates the tools Samsung provides remote support, while strong, can be misleading at times.My belief is Samsung and Amazon are trying, but Internet communication is complex, and it is probably beyond the scope of most normal support folks.In conclusion, my belief, is some people will have network issues caused by router or switch hardware / software that vendors like Samsung will not always be able to resolve. In such cases, the Samsung product itself may not be defective, but customers may not have the ability to determine the nature of a network problem, or to resolve it.I hope this helps someone who has network issues with a smart TV in the future.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't listen to the \"Negative Nelly\" reviews!", "Author": "Tricia Schatz", "ReviewID": "R3BYKDO04H4P61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv roughly 3 weeks ago and I LOVE IT!  Now, let me first say, that *frankly* I was nervous about buying it.  I initially read one or two very positive reviews and I thought, \" Ok, sounds great!  For $550 bucks, a new Smart TV, insanely sharp picture....I'm in!\"  THEN, after I ordered it, I started reading more reviews.  A lot of crummy ones!  So, then I started second guessing myself thinking, \"Oh no.  What have I just done.  Crap!  Maybe I should cancel the order.  There's still time.  It won't ship for at least a few hours (or more.)\"  So, I started looking at similar 40 inch flat screens, and this is what I came up with.  At the end of the day, the other tv's of similar features were $100-400 more expensive than this Samsung and it seemed to do everything I wanted it to do.The seeds of doubt that were planted in my head (all untrue, by the way as I will explain) by other reviews on the tv were this:1) This tv is not an \"all-in one, one stop shop\" for streaming, roku, etc...2) The sound is terrible! It's not loud enough, it doesn't produce theater or surround sound, etc...3) The streaming is terrible!  Slow to load apps, you have to start over after you close out of an app, you still need a Roku even if you buy thisThese were all concerns that I had once I ordered it.  But, I am also the queen of second guessing myself and over thinking stuff.  So, I came to the conculsion, \"Look, just order the tv.  even if it doesn't do a THING, for $550 and FREE SHIPPING, you can't go wrong!\"  You'll at least get a killer picture.  And let me say, I am SO GLAD, I got it!  Here is what I found about the other issues other people have raised:1)  I do not believe that the tv description purports itself to be a substitute for Roku or Apple TV.  It has goodness, at least 20 apps or more that you can use: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus, MSNBC, facebook, twitter, and a bunch of other apps that I don't care about really.  I just ordered an Apple TV because I like the idea of streaming my computer onto the tv.  Here's why:  I am a huge Project Runway fan.  You can download the Lifetime app and watch the episodes on the app, or watch on the computer.  Which even with a subscription of $8 a month with Hulu, you can't watch Project Runway.  So that has nothing to do with the Samsung TV.  Even ABC.com, why pay $8 a month with Hulu to watch shows on ABC or NBC (that's $96 a year) when you can watch it for free on abc.com.  So if you stream it onto the TV from your computer with an Apple TV, it justifies your purchase of the appletv ( I paid $84 through Amazon on Black Friday.)  If you have Directv or something else like that, this tv is a great compliment to it.  One way or anther if you want a lot of choice with your tv, you will pay extra for it one way or another.  Whether it's paying for Directv, buying an apple tv or a roku, paying for shows through Amazon Prime, iTunes, or pay for a subscription with netflix or Hulu plus.  I really don't want that much more than cartoons for my kids, rent new movie releases, American Idol, the Voice, and Netflix.  And for that, this tv is PERFECT.2) The sound is fantastic.  It is VERY loud when you take the volume to full blast. The neighbors would be able to hear my tv if I had the windows open.  I suppose if you want the walls to rattle and have a massive house and want to hear it from all rooms, then yes, perhaps you should invest in a stereo system to create the surround sound/movie theater experience.  But again, for $550 what do you expect?  Sitting right in front of the tv on my couch, I listen to it at about 1/3 of what the volume can go to.3) The streaming is terrible.  The sound doesn't match up to the picture on Netflix.  I don't know what that guys problem was, but the sound is perfect and the picture is crystal clear perfect.  I wasn't quite sure what he meant about the picture looking \"soap-opera-ery)\" until I got the tv, and now I know what he means.  Prior to buying this tv, I had a Panasonic flat screen from 7 years ago.  I thought I had a good picture until I got this tv.  Basically, the picture is so crisp and clear, that it almost seems like the video production of the show seems \"cheap.\" (and I am referring to watching Breaking Bad on Netflix)  It is nuts how sharp the picture is.  I could see fuzz on the top of the character's shoulder of his lab jump suit.  It's like you are looking at a photograph it is so sharp.  Also, it has never taken a minute for the app to load.  I think it loads just fine.  Like normal.  It isn't any slower than using Netflix on a tablet or the computer.  And furthermore, the fact that that guy was mad that he had to start all over and find the show he wants on Prime, good grief.  Prime should fix their app then, it's not the tv. Even if you paused a movie on Directv that you had recorded, it will ultimately time out and you have to go back into your list, find the show, and push play again.The conclusion to this review is that it is a GREAT TV for the money.  It does EVERYTHING it claims it does, and no problems.  I called customer service a few times for help setting it up and a password problem I was having with Netflix and everything got resolved quickly and easily.  They are so happy to help, and gave great service.  It is sad when people are looking for problems and a reason to bag on a product or expect it to do everything in the world but cook their food, and then get on the computer and give a crappy review and freak a ton of people out who would have otherwise bought the tv and been very happy.

The first one I ordered through Amazon could not remember my router password.  Every time I turned the TV on, it told me that I was not connected to the internet.  I had to go through the same process of reconnecting to the internet by entering my router password.  When watching a movie through the internet, it would lose it's internet connection several times, meaning I had to go through the connection process again and again.  Since Samsung phone support was unable to determine the cause of the problem, they set me up with an appointment with a Samsung service technician.  After fiddling with the TV for a while he told me I needed a new WiFi card and new computer board.  I called Amazon and had them pick this TV up and deliver another one (same model). It had the very same issues with the WiFi connection/disconnection.  At that point I gave up.  I had Amazon pick up this second TV and ordered an LG Smart TV.  It works great, has a good picture and is \"smart\" enough to remember my password.  I have not been disconnected from the internet yet, and have not been asked to reenter my password since I first configured it.  If you plan on using the internet with your TV, I would definitely stay away from Samsung until they get this problem fixed!

Owned a couple of front projectors over the last decade, currently without one...still have a very large 2.35:1 Da-Lite high gain screen.  I don't play video games.  I mostly watch 1080i \"hdtv\" broadcasts, or else blu rays via a slightly old player.  All connected with silver-plated HDMI cable (yes it does make a big difference...and this cable did not cost very much, either).With the above in mind, most of my review is about my personal journey, and my perception of the tv, regarding image quality.  I've not begun to dig into many of the \"smart tv\" features.  They do seem to work fine, though.  Would work better with a keyboard.  Also my internet connection is not the fastest.I've had this 46F6300 tv nearly a month.  I had tried the 40 inch 5000 series, but returned it (it had the \"sharp\" panel, and it just plain sucked...Thankfully, this particular 46F6300 only comes with the Samsung panel, so you can order one from anywhere and not have to worry about the Samsung \"panel lottery\").  Having spent a lot of money on new camera equipment over the last 6 months, amongst other things...I wanted to see if I could live with spending a minimum amount of cash on a tv.  It turns out, I could not.  And 40 inches is smaller than two people can comfortably watch anyway.  Sitting 12 feet away from any 1080p tv smaller than 80 inches, is a waste of pixels in my opinion...so I sit much closer.  But sitting closer means there's barely room for two people...at least on the front row.After some extra research, and joining AVS forum (a few debates on another forum)...and several visits to local tv showrooms, I concluded this F6300 would suit me.  After living with it for 3 weeks at home, I can certainly be happy with it, but I will always want something better.  The problem is, \"better\" costs anywhere from 50% more, to 150% more...or even 3000% more!  At this time, there is probably only one other \"1080p\" tv I want: a Sony which costs over $2000...and it's only 55 inches.  Currently the best looking tv I have seen in person, is the Samsung 4k.  Samsung's demo looks a lot better than Sony's demo on their 4k TV's.  But then Sony are pushing their 4k upsampled movie disc drive, so demo content relies on movie clips which lack the \"wow\" factor.  OLED tv's will be putting every tv available now, to shame over the next few years, in any case.  But until then, the new 4k panels, absolutely put most of the 1080p panels to shame, in terms of color, contrast, and black level (not even counting the 4-times-more pixels).  That 1080p Sony I mention above, with its own dedicated 1080p demo in the store, does get close to the 4K panels...in my opinion...at least in terms of color palette and saturation without clipping (certainly not in detail, obviously).Getting back to this Samsung UN46F6300...Comparing the F6300 to what I saw in the stores, in my opinion, the 7100 series is just not enough better to justify the price difference.  Sure the 7100 has \"3D\", but if that's important to you, you might not be reading this.  The biggest difference, is the 7100 seems to have solved the \"dark corner\" backlight issue of the 6300 (an inch square in each corner of the screen, is slightly dark at times...I can live with it.  You're almost never looking in the extreme corners anyway unless there's a tv commercial where the whole screen is white, and you get bored with that...)And the 8000 series, is also not that much improved over the 7100...yet costs quite a bit more.  Certainly the 8000 still suffers from a lack of a really wide color gamut.My opinion of 3D is, it's a cute feature if you have the money to blow, and young children...but really it's just the CG cartoons such as \"Despicable Me\", etc...which look good in 3D.  Live action 3D looks fake to me unless it's shot with dual IMAX film cameras (almost nothing is anymore)...and all consumer 3D glasses I have viewed, ruin color saturation and balance...and destroy shadow detail...not to mention they're annoying to wear.  So I see the current 3D technology as a slowly passing fad...But if you want the best panel from any manufacturer, it will be 3D anyway...except of course for 4K (currently)!After quite a bit of fiddling with the settings, I can state that this F6300 appears to have decent black level, color saturation, contrast, and motion processing...with an adequate amount of shadow detail (not great, but definitely adequate).  BUT TO ACHIEVE THIS, you need to watch in a dark room with the backlight turned down (a lot)...and the contrast set a bit above \"50\", with brightness below \"50\".  To turn the backlight above halfway, and set contrast and brightness below halfway...destroys blacks, and the image loses its contrast and \"crispness\".  Sure the brightness \"grabs\" your eyes and makes them take notice, but what they're noticing...does not look good.  I suspect the 7100 series is just not that much better, here.  Certainly it was hard to tell in the store, with their absurd demo reel that wasn't even connected via HDMI...The \"black tone\" and \"dynamic contrast\" can be useful if the content needs them, but if the content is shot/edited correctly, you won't need these features.  Certainly the gamma setting can vary, usually from \"0\" to \"3\".  Rarely if ever did I need to go below \"0\".So...In a bright room, the 6300 can go extremely bright (turn the backlight to 20 and the contrast up a lot)...but there won't be any blacks at all, or even dark grays.  Given the display seems almost as bright as a searchlight in this mode...I guess that isn't surprising.  The matte screen likely works very well in a bright room, but for me I would rather read a magazine or book in a bright room...or else look at the world outside through the windows.  I don't agree with some who feel the matte screen \"keeps the colors from popping\" as well as is possible with a full gloss screen.  I think it's mostly due to this matte screen being \"glossy enough\", yet still matte.  The 5000 series had a much more matte screen that did look dull by comparison to the 6300.Regarding the built in speakers...being an audiophile who used to have more time, and was more obsessed than I can currently afford to be...compared to the 5000 tv, the speakers in this F6300 sound fabulous!  The 5000's sounded like honking geese (yet its speaker drivers were larger)!  The 6300's equalizer needs very little adjusting.  These speakers work just fine for when you don't want to turn the surround system on, and portray very nice \"out of phase\" stereo imaging from the \"downconverted from surround to two channel\" digital audio signal being fed to them (and this is still in the \"standard\" audio mode).  The treble is plenty extended enough, given these are downfiring, and thus \"quasi-omnidirectional\" (as are most flat panel tv speakers).  There are a few spoken-word documentaries, where the person was mic'ed with too much chest sound...which can be a tad annoying...but for soundtracks that are mixed correctly (90% or so of all tv and movie content), these tv speakers sound neutral.  It's hard to believe so much sound can come from tiny 1x3 inch speakers firing down at the floor!A few tips for setting this tv:One thing you don't want to do, is leave the picture mode in \"standard\", because it will constantly vary the backlight...and on dark scenes, actually turns the backlight down, probably to \"0\".  Very frustrating, so just don't watch in this mode.  Who cares if it saves you 10 watts per year of power consumption??  Just use your hairdryer for a few less nanoseconds per year, and you can offset the power usage.  \"Movie\" mode is the only mode you should use.  \"Dynamic\" and \"Neutral\" don't allow access to the advanced menu...Set \"auto motion plus\" to \"2\" on both types of material.  Any higher and objects in motion appear to \"float\"...looks very fake...this is where the \"soap opera\" criticism comes into play.  As long as you set it to 2, or else turn it off, you won't have a problem.  Sure there is content which has crappy, jittery motion...but just endure it...or else set the auto motion feature to high during this content, and then back down again after it's over.The white balance on my sample, is not remotely white.  Don't be afraid to tweak both the white balance and customize the color gamut.  First, of course, set the color temperature to \"standard\", and adjust all the sliders so that most broadcast tv material looks like the correct color temperature when set to \"standard\".  That way, it gives you one \"cool\", and two \"warm\" quick-adjustments beyond that (useful especially for many modern movies which are way too blue).I wound up boosting yellow in the color gamut (all three sliders of the yellow, but not equally), and cutting red in the white balance...but again literally every slider in both menus needed adjusting (this is within the \"advanced menu\").  It took two weeks before I had it all completely dialed in how I wanted it.  I didn't use any measurement devices, just my eyes and normal program material.  I trust them more than a device because I can live with how my eyes want everything set, and I can't live with how a device wants it set.  If I see the world through my eyes, they should correctly show me what is wrong with a tv, with some trial and error.In case you have not guessed by now, I am also someone who would change a few settings, when switching to the blu ray player...as the one I own needs a higher gamma setting than the DVR/receiver does.  This annoys the other people who are there to watch, but that's too bad!I definitely do not believe in setting all the adjustments on the tv once, and then never changing them ever again.  That assumes all content and sources look exactly the same...and they don't.  Of course, I am someone who is a bit of an artist, and I pay attention to how things look...and notice if something looks off.Your mileage may vary.  Can I state for a fact that this is the best 46 inch tv for what I paid ($749)?  No, but the only other brand with the same size panel I compared it to in three different stores, was the LG 47 inch.  The colors just did not look as varied, the primaries looked too saturated...just didn't care for the \"LG look\".  The Sony models below $1000, to me also did not measure up to this Samsung.  The plasmas...well there are those freaks who swear by them...but certainly the plasmas in this price range, also did not do it for me.  The black levels were perhaps a tad better, but not enough to convince me the overall \"look\" was better.  The best plasma I have ever seen, was a 720p Pioneer Elite back in 2005, and it cost $5000 back then.  I hear they still fetch a pretty penny on the used market.  Plasma today, appears to be going into extinction...perhaps that's a shame, but whatever will be will be.  Backlit LED will very likely follow the same path, but for now a \"lower end\" version is all I can afford.  I had wanted a new 1080p front projector, but decided I could wait...mostly because the only ones that looked adequate were over $2000.  But also I don't care for the trend of using a \"silent\" fan which also does not cool the lamp adequately...forcing you to buy another $300 to $500 lamp every 100 hours.

TV arrived August 28 because the company that delivers only came by my area Mon, Wed and Fri. I thought it was supposed to be white glove delivery, take it out of the box, test the TV to see if it worked, but I guess these guys didn't want to do that. Anyways, I didn't have time to set the TV up until Friday, the 30th, had it up on the wall and everything, went to turn it on, neither of the HDMI inputs worked, aww wtheck?! Called up Amazon hotline to troubleshoot. Spoke to Jeff to troubleshoot, nothing worked so he transferred me over to Samsung's Service Department. Spoke to their representative and they told me they couldn't get a tech out to me till the following Friday...I bought a brand new TV and it needs to be serviced?!  Before Jeff transferred me over he told me he would call me in 1 to 2 hours to see if everything was resolved, he called back as promised, and he did what Samsung should have done, he offered to have the TV replaced because no one pays that much money for a broken TV. When the new TV arrived, these guys actually took it out of the box and tested the TV to make sure it worked.Now onto the TV itself. TV is perfect, at first I debated if I wanted to go with Sony, LG, or even Sharp. Went to one of the big box stores to compare in person, I was always led back to Samsung, the color and picture is so much better than any other brand.

I reconnected it, and continued.  But every 5 - 50 minutes, it would lose its connection again - a 90 minute movie took 150 minutes to view in its entirety.Okay, so the next day was spent talking to someone at Samsung who regrettable knew very little about Wi-Fi, the internet, or her product.  She was simply looking for excuses to blame something else for the problem, rather than take ownership and help me solve it.  Upon learning that the Wi-Fi router was 30 ft from the television, she said 'You have to move it closer - no further away than 10 ft'.  She didn't ask what the signal strength was, she just said that Samsung tv's have weak Wi-Fi transceivers and aren't rated to work more than 10 ft away from the router.  Hmmmm - that's not quite the official Wi-Fi spec, which calls for 100+ ft of indoor connectivity.  She also didn't ask which Wi-Fi protocol was in use, or the router make/model or anything.  Just gave up as soon as she heard the tv was more than ten feet away.After some fairly aggressive demands for a more sensible solution, she arranged for a call back today from a product specialist.This guy, Cody, conceded that 30 ft was okay, but went off on another tangent.  He said that because other devices are sharing the internet connection, the problem must be that other devices were sucking up all the bandwidth, and to speak to the router manufacturer about giving the tv priority access.Now this guy, while slightly more competent, also didn't ask relevant questions.  For example, he didn't ask how much total bandwidth I had (35 Mbits/sec of high quality reliable consistent fiber optic) nor did he ask what the other devices were doing or how much bandwidth they were consuming.  He simply found his own excuse and stuck to it.So, I said to him, 'what say I turn off all the other devices and the tv is the only thing connected to the network - what would you recommend then?'.His answer?  'Because our tv can connect to your router, it is obviously not our problem'.  But that ignores the problem - the problem is not connecting, the problem is staying connected, and it is a problem that his tv seems to have, but none of my phones and tablets and other devices share.I asked to speak to someone more senior.  He said he was the most senior person at Samsung.  I asked for a phone  number to call their corporate office.  He put me on hold for several minutes, then told me to click on the 'Contact Us' link on their website and send an email.No, Cody, I'm not going to send an email.  But I'm surely going to send your tv back.A very disappointing result.  As I said, a great tv, lovely picture, but it simply isn't working and Samsung has refused to help resolve the problem.  Caveat emptor, accordingly.**EDIT - Further Comments (original comments unchanged)**I'm trying desperately not to have to return the tv - the fact that I've already destroyed some of the packaging being a contributing factor in this!  :)So the first thing I did was buy a new state of the art router from Amazon, and see if that would help.  For less than $100, that would be a cheap and easy fix.  Alas, the new router, with an amazing 'up to 300 Mb/sec' bandwidth, did not solve the problem at all.  It remained, exactly as before, unchanged.  (See also my replies to the comments to my review for further discussion of Wi-Fi related issues.)Next, I decided to do exactly what Samsung's 'expert' assured me would solve the problem, giving priority bandwidth access to the tv.  But this proved to be a solution that was worse than the problem.  At least with the TP Link router, it seemed that doing so would dedicate bandwidth to the tv, whether it needed it or not, while costing me bandwidth for other devices.  The whole thing about the internet and about streaming over the internet is that it is designed to be moderately congestion resilient.  It uses buffering to address moderate congestion issues, and with my 35 Mb/sec FIOS bandwidth, in the vanishingly unlikely event that the connection couldn't keep up with the 5 Mb/sec need of the television, then the buffers would be very quickly replenished without any noticeable effect.  Certainly, congestion doesn't explain why the tv not only lost the signal but couldn't then reconnect, even though testing the Wi-Fi showed fast responsive bandwidth at the same time.Moving right along, I now attached third party devices to the tv's HDMI inputs to provide the same solution - a Roku device, a Chromecast device, and another device not so well known.  They all worked just fine, but doing this uncovered a new problem with the tv.  Aaagh!It seems that the tv tries to be 'helpful' and any time something happens on any of the HDMI inputs, the tv automatically switches to that input.  So, for example, I'd been playing music through Pandora on the Chromecast device, then switched to watching a movie via the Roku.  I closed down Pandora on my phone, but the Chromecast device (which I really should review separately, it has been a big disappointment) wouldn't stop playing Pandora.  So every time Pandora changed songs, the tv would switch back to the Chromecast input.  Aaagh indeed.  The only solution I could easily find was to unpower the Chromecast.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 32'' LED I've tried, perfect for the small bedroom", "Author": "Xel Adune", "ReviewID": "R15LZ8KRUIU4YC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:- Bold, sharp image, high contrast, deep blacks, 10-point white balance, +tons of features for tuning for the best picture.- Excellent PC Mode, colors can be accurately calibrated, perfectly fine as computer monitor (you must set the name under Tools to *PC* for the mode to work)- Fast PC and Game Mode- 4 HDMI ports.- Most Display Settings are saved separately for each input source, make sure to select Apply Picture Mode: Current Source under Display settings.Cons:- No local dimming.

There are a lot of reviews of people calling customer service that the wrong screws were shipped or that it has the wrong base. The fact is, the screws are a VERY tight fit - so much that the plastic probably deforms a bit as the screw goes in. Get a good screwdriver and apply a lot of torque. It'll go in.The screws that attach the base to the TV are not nearly as tight, but they still need a decent amount of torque as well.I haven't tried removing them (and it will probably be a challenge), but I'll tell you that base is nice and stable once you get it together.

Easy setup, a multitude of settings for picture enhancement and a fair amount of apps make this LED TV a winner in the under $700.00 market.

I can only imagine what a screen of 55\" or more would be like to watch, but I'm quite satisfied with this 40\" as it fits my living room viewing area quite well. Following some suggested online picture settings I tweaked the image and am very pleased with the results. Watching movies on Netflix in SuperHD, even those from 20 to 30 years ago, is unbelievable, as far as detail and color are concerned. It seems as if your right there while the movie is being filmed. The picture is that clear.

We have a Sharp sound bar hooked up for better sound. Overall this is a good TV but there are somethings which we wish were better or just working fine. All we wanted was a smart TV with RVU tuner with built-in WiFi. Amazon\u2019s delivery was on time and was great. The company called ahead and came in the prescribed time and the whole process was very smooth. hats off to Amazon for delivering such an experience.BACKGROUND:We replaced our 46\" Samsung LN46C60 with this 55\" Samsung F6300. Our 46\" TV was purchased in 2010 and is a decent TV. It still works fine. When we saw this TV in our BestBuy showroom, believe me the Samsung TVs stood out from the rest. We did our research before finalizing on this one. We didn't care for the 3D and 4K technology is still in its infancy and the upgrade is not worth it. We were contemplating between this Samsung, Sharp LE650 series and Sony R520A series. It is very hard to compare the Samsung models to the competition because Samsung doesn't release the Dynamic Contrast Ratio etc in their specs. We have a Samsung TV thats been great for three years and hence we settled with the same brand. When you go to a showroom to decide it is hard to decide which one is better because of the setting each TV is on and lighting in the section. In the Samsung section in our BestBuy they had placed 6300, 6400, and 7100 side by side running the same demo. So it was easier to compare the different models. We couldn't find any noticeable difference between the three models except for the 3D and the price. Here's a summary of things we like and don't like in this TVPROs:* Picture quality - Great picture quality* Depth - Thinnest compared to Sharp or Sony models. This was the deciding factor when selecting Samsung over Sharp or Sony* Built-in WiFi* RVU tuner for DirecTV. Sharp TVs don't have this.* Bezel - Thinnest compared to Sharp or Sony. Second deciding factor.CONS:* NETFLIX - One of the biggest negative of this TV!!. Sound is off when streaming content from Netflix. Sound bar works fine when watching regular TV but when streaming content via netflix there is no sound from the sound bar. We had to turn off the TV and turn it on again which worked once. Other time we had to power cycle the whole system to get it working.* Sound - Without a sound bar or Home theater set up forget about the sound. In order to make the TVs thinner and bezel smaller Samsung sacrificed big time on speakers (sound). We could watch without turning on the sound bar on our old TV but this one we can't even watch regular TV without the sound bar on.* Glare - The screen is very glossy so in a well lit room as ours there is significant glare on the screen. If you have a darker room this TV would work fine. If it is going to be in a well lit room, be prepared for the glare on the screen. We had to close all the blinds and turn lights off to enjoy a glare free picture* Viewing Angle - If you\u2019re not right in front of the TV, then the picture is not so great. In fact the viewing angle is not even as good as our 3 year old Samsung. The glare makes the angle even smaller.* Stand - This is one of the cheapest stand we have seen yet. If you do not mount his TV on the wall, it will look very cheap. The stand is shaped weird because you can't place the sound bar just below the TV (The stand blocks it from placing it). Currently the sound bar is placed in-front of the TV.* IR blaster - Samsung has a IR device that the delivery person said to place infront of the cable box for the TV remote to work. We played around placing the IR device placement around, above, in front of the cable box, still doesn't work. Samsung displays the guide based on your geographic location and cable provider but doesn't tune to the channel as the cable box was not programmed. We were able to program the TV using the cable box remote in a snap. The smart features are still clunkyWe would have given the TV a five star if the netflix was working fine.

Compared to last year's line up of this series, they made it more snappy with a  dual core processor and in result i found the navigation to be responsive. I like the netflix button on the remote for easy access. The remote feels great. Not cheap. Even the little indent on the backside fits well for your finger is a nice touch.I also have a top of the line Samsung plasma which cost me over double this for my main room. In comparison, this led tv is very light. I can pick this up myself. As a plasma enthusiast for years, I wanted to see how it fared against this newer tv with LED technology. So i set them up next to each other to play.LED pretty much runs silent, the plasma needs more energy and in its same thinnest of a chassis, it has a small but noticeable humm in certain scenes. LED brightness wins in bright sunlit room competition. Black levels, Plasma wins easily in comparison but stand apart from each other, you probably won't miss it on the LED. Fast scenes, with the new standard of LEDs being 120hz, it's pretty good, but if you are used to plasma, you will immediately notice that LED tends to smooth things over a bit less naturally. But some people (like my wife) is impressed by this artificial look of LEDs.Gaming, is great especially with gaming mode. boosting colors and speed of reducing input lag that some tv's have problem with.I suggest trying the calibrating the tv instead of out the box (i used: lcdtvbuyingguidedotcom). Instead of using the over pumped up factory settings or what you see at the store meant to overstimulate you and say wow look how crazy bright that is, when it is actually not to whatever you are watching's intent.bottom line. If you need a nice picture at a low price point, this samsung does very well. It has extensive calibration interface. I personally don't care for 3d (and welcome the lower price point for omitting it) or most the smart things on tv's (though its there).

Although bright scenes look very good, dark scenes suffer from severe screen uniformity issues (flashlighting, asymmetrical backlighting, dark & light clouding, etc.)  on my particular 60\" unit.  This makes the overall viewing experience unsatisfactory.  This took me by surprise, given the great review that CNET gave for their 55\" evaluation model.  I understand that many edge-lit LED televisions suffer from some uniformity issues, but I believe that the level of non-uniformity that I am experiencing goes well beyond the norm, into the realm of defect.  Somehow, this particular unit must have made it past Samsung's otherwise excellent quality control procedures.  Sadly, Samsung disagrees with me.  I've contacted them multiple times regarding this issue.  I've had a service technician on site to evaluate the unit, and confirm the issues.  I've even elevated the issue to Samsung 'Executive Customer Service'.  However, we seem to have reached an impasse.  Samsung continues to state that the issues that I am experiencing are 'normal', despite my assertion that they are beyond the norm.

I have always been a loyal Samsung customer, and have purchased 4 separate Samsung displays in the past 6 years.  I've always recommended the brand to friends and family.  I paid a *PREMIUM* price for a premium product.  I paid hundreds of dollars more than a equally sized smart TV's from one of the 'second tier' TV manufacturers.

It's got a beautiful picture, great color, good enough sound, looks great sitting on the TV stand. Watching TV looks great, playing games looks great (sometimes I just want to sit and watch the PS3's XMB home screen, it looks that good!). The smart features are pretty good, app selection seems on par with Roku, though I haven't gone in and done an app-for-app checklist or anything - actually, since this has YouTube, it's actually better than Roku, at least as far as the apps that we care about.The Clear Motion thing is weird, we dialed ours back to the \"clear\" setting, which made things nice and sharp but did not give a noticeable \"soap opera\" effect. I think the default was \"sharp\" or something, which definitely had the soap opera thing.I have a few cons that, collectively, cause me to drop a star. I'd go a star and a half if I could, but I will err on the positive side, I guess.First, setting the aspect ratio to \"screen fit\" vs \"wide fit\" affects the entire input source... which would be fine, except our cable box obviously goes through a single source, so we keep having to switch back and forth depending on whether we're watching an HD or SD channel. Our last TV's equivalent setting correctly stretched the SD channels, but HD channels came through untouched. This stretches *everything* including HD, so if you have it on the correct mode for an SD channel but then change to an HD channel, it's zoomed in and the edges get cut off, and you have to flip it back to the other mode. And vice-versa, moving from HD to SD you get black bars until you flip it.Second, the Smart Hub as a whole seems kind of unstable. I've not experienced the daily/random wifi drop like other reviewers, however, we've had other problems. At one point it lost every single app, so we had to do a factory reset and walk through the entire setup process again to get it to pick them back up and redownload everything. We've had to log into Netflix at least four different times because it lost/reset the stored credentials (and trying to enter a secure password with an onscreen, remote-based keyboard is... unpleasant...). When it works, it's great. But it's just unstable enough to be annoying. Hopefully they'll get a firmware update to fix.Finally, we complemented the TV with a Samsung soundbar, plugged into the optical out. This TV did not support the wireless connection. Not a big deal, I'd actually prefer the optical over wireless anyway. Normally everything's great. However, in the YouTube app specifically, the sound is noticeably delayed. But only in YouTube. Netflix works fine, cable and PS3 work fine, the other apps I've played with all seem fine. But YouTube gets delayed. If you leave the TV speakers enabled, you can hear it \"echo\" as the TV speakers play something first, then half a second later the soundbar plays it. I have messed with the delay settings on both the TV and the soundbar and I've managed to minimize it, but - much like the aspect ratio above - if I fix it for one source, I have to unfix it everywhere else. If it was across the board, I'd guess it was the soundbar's fault (or my own fault for failing to get the delay settings correct), but since it's only in one specific app, I can only assume it's the TV's fault, something is causing the video and audio to desync in YouTube.That's it.

This was sort of a let down because it meant that the 'Smart TV' function would not work. Fine. Whatever. After some time messing with it, I got it to work, sort of.

It's got some apps that work nice- Netflix, TimeWarner Cable, HBO Go, a few others. It was a built in web browser, it works but won't blow your socks off, and interface is cumbersome, just using the supplied remote.I'm using it in an office. I've got an Apple TV, PS3, and computer hooked up to this baby. The Apple TV test worked great- looks so sharp. The PS3 worked even better- the blue-ray quality on this thing is just sick. The real shocker came when I hooked up the computer. The picture looks almost as sharp as any decent computer monitor. (Note that I'm using an NVidia GTX570 card). Star Craft 2 and others looks awesome on this thing. (Had to tweak settings on both the TV and computer but, once done- awesome).One important note, and something I noticed in other reviews- people complained of dark picture quality. This thing is an LED TV. If the picture is too dark, you're doing it wrong. During set-up, it automatically switched to Eco Sensor. It was quick- like, if I wasn't paying attention, I would have missed it. I had to dig around in the settings a little to find it but, when I turned that off, brightness improved by 100% (I did a couple other tweaks as well, again, my application is a dark windowless office room). I tested it in a my loft, where there's a lot of natural light, again, after a few tweaks, I can see the picture well, although dark scenes are a little hard to see.The speakers aren't all that great but let's be honest, if you're spending money on a TV like this- do you really care about the audio that comes with it? I'm hooked up to a sound bar- works fine. This is all about picture quality and Samsung always nails it. I've had it almost a week now and done some extensive testing and love it. I wall mounted it now, and it looks so pretty sitting on my wall. (Side note, pictures look incredible as a screen saver on this thing).Note that the only audio output is optical. Hmm... Interesting. Fine, whatever. And there is no DVI output, nor is there a VGA connection. My graphics card has HDMI output, so, not an issue for me.

I watch a lot of TV from streaming sources and the implementation on the Samsung apps is one of the best I've used.-  Light weight.  It was amazingly light weight.  Made mounting it a breeze.-  Sound Quality - Since this is a bedroom set it's not hooked up to surround sound.  I was really pleasantly surprised by the sound quality.Cons- Cord is VERY short I think about 4 ft.  Not a good length if you are wall mounting it.- Cord is also not a standard \" IEC320C13\" connector like most monitors, computers etc use.  I believe it's a Nonpolarized \"IEC320C7\"  but I can't swear to that.- Price.  This is a very expensive set.  Several Hundred more that the UN32F5500.  Be sure that the extra features and refresh rate are worth it for you.  For me they were.  You may decide it is not.Neutral- Lot's of features I will probably never use like gesture control (requires a webcam) or Skype (also requires a webcam).", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV but DO NOT buy this if you plan streaming.", "Author": "Edward Dye", "ReviewID": "R17ASRAOAPSF76", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this model and while streaming HD the picture pixelizes pretty bad.

I chose this model for its light weight, built in wi-fi, and its controllability from a smart device. The physical stature of the tv is awesome. It is super light weight, very thin, and has a great physical appearance. The built in wi-fi has some connectivity problems very randomly, mostly while streaming video, It seems to work better for music. Samsungs interface, the \"smart hub\", is so time consuming to use without an external keyboard that its ridiculous. Enter Samsungs answer, Allshare. Allshare is a downloadable app that lets you use your smartphone to control the tv, including channel, volume, screen mirroring, and some other cool features, but what they don't advertise, is that Allshare is only available on Samsung smartphones and tablets. There are other programs for android and iOS that will control the tv, but only with basic controls of volume, channel, input and power. The tv also has no bluetooth capability, so a usb bluetooth connector has to be used.

It doesn't do the best job buffering though, so I'll need to pick up a hub and make sure it's wired into Ethernet.Con 1: The Amazon page for this product very clearly states that this model (60 inch, F6300) supports SoundShare. However, this is not the case. I had purchased this tv and a sound system, expecting to hook up the sound system via SoundShare (wireless), and was very surprised to learn that, contrary to the product description, SoundShare is only supported on the F6400 model and up. So, that was really lame. Amazon did give me a 10% refund though, so if I could give a half star back for that, I would.Con 2: I am not impressed with the \"smart\" portion's user interface and menus. It all feels very clunky and laggy and slow. Especially the browswer. And the media server reading software. And, the OSD it takes nearly the whole screen, you'd think with a 60\" TV they could have an option to shrink down the user interface a bit.

Ended up ordering it from a big box retailer when it was on sale last week. Granted, I have not played around with it much yet so this review is on initial impression and first couple times watching.Picture is fantastic for what I wanted. The blacks are not deep black but that's expected in an LED. I'm sure I could get deeper if I fiddled with the settings more. Out of the box the picture was good. It was initially blurry and I thought it was a panel issue as many people have stated various manufacturers provide the LED panel. I just had to go into settings and have the signal transmit 1080i (it was just 720) and that fixed the problem. I do have some flashlighting when looked at a mostly black screen but that's not a big deal to me. I don't use the Smart feature and didn't really like the SmartHub popping up every time I turned the TV on so I went into settings to turn that off as well.The one issue I have run into and I'm not sure if I missed a setting if it's something with my cable provider (Directv) but when I change channels, my directv switches properly but then .5-1 second later the TV itself seems to take over and show the HDMI source on the tv thus delaying the picture from coming up another 1-2 seconds. We have this same model in the 2011 line (UN60D6000) hooked up to directv in another room and this issue is not present.Overall, this is a great TV for my needs. Didn't want 3D or any of those higher features. This serves the purpose and is highly recommended to anyone looking for a good TV.

I read from other reviews that the sound was bad, but I have to say that it was much better than expected. I was expecting it to sound like a 32 inch vizio that I have that sounds like a transistor radio. So I had gone ahead and ordered a samsung sound bar from amazon. Could have done without it, but I'm glad I bought a sound bar. Have not used much of the smart tv features as I'm sure they all cost money. But that aspect of the tv is not why I bought the tv. We bought a samsung because we've had good lunch with all samsung electronics .PROS The picture is nice and crisp and natural looking.The stand is ok, but liked the older model stands. The stand does swivel.We had no trouble setting the tv to our wireless network.The sound quality was pretty nice for such a slim tv. Not tin sounding. It's quite adequate unless you want to feel like you are at a concert or in the movie theater . If you want that, you need to buy a sound bar.A FEW WORDS AVOUT THE REMOTE-This tv has a universal remote only. Now I went back and forth as to wether or not to buy a higher model for the touch remote but read that most who had it wished they had a universal . A lot of people had a lot of trouble getting their remote to work with their cable set top box, so I was expecting to have to use both . Well I'm happy to say the my remote responds to all but a couple of things. I used the enclosed IR cable, strung it under my Motorola STB and have it 2 inches in front of box as directions suggest. It turns everything (including the sound bar) on and off together. All volume works. I can get to the cable STB guide, and I can even operate the DVR !!!!! Can record, watch and select from my recordings schedule recordings. Everything that I do with my verizon cable remote.  The only strange thing that I can't figure out is why you can't change the channel by entering the channel by number. Very strange. Have to go through the channel guide.Cons- so far I've only found one con. I'm not crazy about the mat screen finish. Seems to have more glare than my old tv that wasn't mat. But it's not a deal breaker. During the day I have a lot of daylight and it's a bit distracting .Final note, I have the samsung HW-f450 sound bar which also works along nicely with the tv remote and also goes on and off with the tv remote.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Pogos", "ReviewID": "R2408SVMH5A5JX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV.

Also - when hooking the tv up to a receiver - you HAVE to use the Any-Net setting for the sound.

IPS panels are praised for their extended high resolution and color accuracy. Yes, colors on my current IPS monitors (DELL U2713HM and DELL 2913WM) are great and beautifully represented. However I always wanted to go bigger but not overkill as I intended to keep using the bigger display as a monitor, not as a HDTV. The 30\" IPS monitors are very expensive for what they provide being way less than perfect displays for gaming. Being used to play on my 2560x1440 27\" monitor, only the idea of playing in a bigger (32\") display at \"only\" 1920x1080 was an absolute NO in my mind. One day I took the chance and tried to experience what playing and watching movies (the same entertainment stuff I do with my monitors) would be about with a 32\" HDTV. Of course, I needed to buy the best image quality 32\" HDTV available being that I been using high quality monitors. After much research and \"test driving\" I chose these native 1080p HDTV which by it's price can be called a \"high grade\" 32\" HDTV because of it's features like 1080p and the 240HZ \"Clear Motion Rate\". Think of the best 32\" HDTV money can buy even when comparing it with the top-of-the-line Sony W 32\" TV.

Absolutely NO, I repeat, NO input lag at all. The games run fluid and not even using GAME MODE there is no detectable input lag. The colors are great, vibrant, full of life and the IMMERSIVE experience it provides over my 27\" monitor is a difference of night and day. You have to experience it to know what I'm talking about: I'm never going to be back to my IPS monitors for playing or watching movies and will keep them for job related tasks.Never knew how much I was missing with not trying to take the chance and jump to the 32\" size world.PIXELATION? In some working programs it's more visible than on my 27\" monitor, of course. But when gaming it's not noticiable and if any the IMMERSIVE experience and no input lag makes you automatically and instantly forget if there was any pixelation at all, but let me tell you that even at the almost the same distance that I use my monitor the pixelation is not noticiable.Buying this HDTV has been one of the most positive and rewarding significant changes I have made in my playing hardware.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Smart features are bad / Motion is delayed", "Author": "K.

I purchase my first Samsung LED 5 years ago. It still have the Samsung picture quality, but I'm disappointed on the quality of software and connectivity, the software evolution pace in 5 years is not up to today's requirements. I will try to go trough all the features that I have used.Set Top Box Integration: This is a great addition that I was unaware and greatly surprise me that I can control my Comcast Set Top Box from the TV (by using the remote extender). It setup was easy and I was able to control my STB right away. It also downloads program information from the cable provider and displays the guide in a nicer way. The only drawback to this, is the \"smart\" does not applies here, since it always displays the guide starting from channel 1 (if you are in channer 754, you will need to scroll your guide to that channel to know what is coming next or what it is on adjacent channels).Samsung DVD & Blue Ray: It does the job to control and play BD and DVD over Samsung's proprietary interface, however, there is no way to open or close the BD & Blue Ray lid from that interface. It is a minor thing, but I consider it a requirement.WiFi and Ethernet: This is one of the big disappointments: Even it has both Ethernet and WiFi, if you want to use the iPhone remote application the TV must be connected over WiFi to your router. I had my TV connected over Ethernet in order to stream Netflix movies without interruption, but it appears that the Ethernet port is useless at the end.All Share: I have a network disk with All-Share enable. Even as the Samsung can display my pictures, they are not fitted to the screen. You have to manually zoom them in order to view them (I might required to take those pictures with higher resolution, but who cares!, let the software size the picture to the screen and let the user decide if they are not the best resolution). It is difficult to move from picture to picture and the user interface is very poor.Web Browser: It does not support Flash and Java. So what it is for? It is advertised as Full Web Browser. Disappointed.Display Share: I think it only works with Samsung PCs. I have downloaded a software on my Laptop and never get it to work.Facebook app is a crap. I tried once and the interface is poor, bad organized, not able to see friends status, not intuitive.In conclusion. It is an excellent TV, but it falls behind on the advertised additions.

This is really my first HD TV, and my first TV over 32\". I bought this TV with Christmas money, and doubt I will ever buy a TV of this price ever again. Nothing wrong with the TV, Im just not much of a TV person.Having said that, I LOVE this TV. The picture is excellent, and the controls for the picture are pretty extensive. I've looked up different profiles for this TV online and tried a few different ones, and they all seem to look good to me. I mostly use this TV for OTA channels, and it works great for this, but really makes the non-HD channels stand out like a sore thumb (which obviously is not the TVs fault). I love the picture and have no complaints.The smart apps are really what make this tv shine for me. I watch ESPN, HBO GO, Netflix, Amazon Prime, MLB.tv, VUDU, and YouTube on this TV with wireless internet with no flaws. The interface is a little clumsy, but it works well for me. I also love the on-screen programming guide, which comes in handy for someone like me who does not have cable tv at home. There's a few functions that I could not get to work correctly, such as naming the different inputs on the screen, and getting a Samsung tablet to mirror on the screen, but those are minor things to me, and are definitely not deal breakers. This TV also allows you to rent movies and Skype, but I haven't tried either of those functions, and probably never will. All the other built-in apps are enough for me. The last thing that I really like is the ability to send what is on the TV to my ipad, and use my ipad as an extra screen when away from the TV. That particular app is a little buggy at times, but overall works well enough for me to keep using it. I can watch TV, change channels, and even turn off the TV from my ipad, which is pretty cool to me.There are a few things that I do not like about this TV. First of all, it does not have built-in Bluetooth, which is a big deal to me since Samsung has a great keyboard/remote control for their TVs, but it only works on Bluetooth. There currently is no workaround to get their keyboard to work on this TV. For $1000, I didn't think that Bluetooth wouldn't be to much of a problem to add, but I guess I was wrong. I looked around online and found a Logitech k400 keyboard that is supposed to work okay with this TV, and that is how I would describe it, as being just \"okay.\"  The keyboard is kind of important to me, as it makes it much faster to type when searching for movies through netflix, amazon, etc, and also when using the built in web browser... which reminds me...The built in web browser is just horrible. It is pretty slow, and is difficult to navigate, even with the wireless keyboard. It really isn't worth using to me, especially when I can just plug in my Appletv and mirror the screen, which works much, much faster.  My only other complaint is that I can't mirror my ipad to this screen natively (without using the Appletv). I know that Samsung and Apple are competitors, and that allowing me to mirror my ipad may never occur, but a fella could hope, can't he?Overall, I really am happy with my purchase, and if I ever decide to spend this much money on a TV again, I would definitely consider buying another Samsung.

I had a Samsung 40\" flat screen non-smart TV previously and really liked it so we stuck with Samsung. No problems with dead pixels, etc. upon arrival. The Amazon in-house delivery worked out great as they called a couple of hours ahead of their arrival and then brought it right into the living room and unboxed it. The screen has a super picture even in severe off-angle viewing. Just to see, I tried watching this from over 60 degrees off center and the picture was not degraded at all from what I could tell. The speakers on all of these newer TV's are not as good as what we were used to years ago and this one is no exception. They are all right, but not exceptional by any stretch. I did not realize it, but this TV has picture-in-picture capability (with a second tuning source such as a CATV box). Unfortunately, it only works with TV source feeds, not a DVD, etc. The PIP feature is difficult to get to as you have to navigate through a couple of sub-menu's to get to it. Definitely not as good as my old TV where I could easily swap the PIP with the main screen. The internet surfing is cool as we never had it before, but unless you get a keyboard/mouse it will grow old quickly using the remote to type in text/move the cursor. We don't have Netflix, etc. so I don't know how those work. The TV connected automatically to our WiFi  without problem.One problem that I found with the connections on the back is that they are placed too far toward the center of the TV. I wish they had moved the A/V RCA jacks and the 4th HDMI out to the edge more. I hung the TV on the wall and used a cantilever arm bracket that spanned 2 studs due to my situation. The 2 folding bracket arms cover the jacks when it is fully collapsed against the wall. I was able to finally get the 4th HDMI cable and the composite cables from a Wii hooked in, but they are really tight and are bending the cables at almost a 90 degree. I did not see it in the Amazon description, but this TV has 400x400 VESA holes on the back.I don't think you will be disappointed with this TV and the Amazon price point of $1599 is pretty good for a Samsung especially with free shipping and no tax.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great price on a great TV (or almost)", "Author": "Gary Ackerman", "ReviewID": "R2G7BQSQX1P2LJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazon had the best price on the Samsung Smart 46: TV\u2026no question about it.

Now the smart part of the smart TV is slightly different.  The Wifi receiver is weak and designed to be located within 6' of your Wifi rougher.  Ours is 60' from the router and the signal must pass through several walls.  I purchased and returned two routers that couldn't deliver, and on the third try I had better results.  However, due to difficulty with Netfilx broadcasts I had to call both Netflix and Samsung.  One blamed the other for the problems.  Ultimately, Samsung had to do a remote factory reset.  We tried from the 60' distance but after 40 minutes of downloading the reset it failed.  Thus, i had to physically move the TV into the same room as the router in order for the reset to download.  It worked in 10 minutes, and Netflix seemed to be operating.  When I moved the TV back to its original location, Netflix was still having problems.  Again, I called Samsung, spoke with a supervisor, and he said, \"unplug the TV and after a minute plug it in again.\"  I did, and we've had a smart TV ever since.

For movies and NFL had it hooked up originally to a Bose Lifestyle 35.  To get 5.1 Surround, use the optical cable output (RCA gives out only in 2.1 Stereo).  Since the 60\" occupies a large portion of our bedroom wall, having the Bose seemed to bulky for the wife, so moved it to the living room area (where a future 75\" is planned) and replaced it with a Pioneer SB23W Soundbar.  This may not be a bass thundering as the Bose but its extremely clear and firm.This is my first Smart TV and first Samsung.  With watching at least 5 hrs/day, am enjoying every moment of it.  Most of the shows are via Directv and the video quality is outstanding.  Watching House of Cards via Netflix is easy and its clear enough when it streams in the 1080p Super HD mode.

The mode did come relatively bright, however, so I reduced the light output accordingly and engaged the LED Clear Motion control, which dims the image quite a bit (about 30 percent). That's not a big deal however, since there's plenty of power in the backlight to compensate.The two-point grayscale ocntrols needed only very minor tweaks to bring as close as possible to perfect, and the same went for the Custom color control--as usual, Samsung's controls worked very well.

It lacked apps for both Amazon Prime and Internet browsing. Numerous phone calls and emails to both Samsung and Amazon never resolved my issue or even answered my questions. A Samsung rep assured me that my TV did, in fact, have a Yahoo app, which it did not. I gave the product 1 star back then--and let me add that I stand by that rating, solely because of those issues. You can't market a \"Smart TV\" that lacks an Internet browser! Plus, the only way I had of viewing my Amazon Prime videos was to hook up my Asus notebook to the back of the TV. That was ridiculous, to say the least. So, when the wall space of our new house demanded a new TV, I started looking at BestBuy for the new SONY ultra HD Smart TV. My husband, who is disabled, really enjoys watching television, particularly our \"cloud\" photos and videos of our grandkids and previous travels. The picture on that new SONY is truly amazing!! But--so is the price. At almost $4,000, I could not justify that kind of expenditure, particularly following a move. So, I decided to give Samsung another look. I had to admit that, during my two years of ownership, I have never had a technical problem, the picture was beautiful, and many of the apps were quite useful. As you might imagine, I researched my prospective purchase backwards, forwards, and sideways to make doubly sure that it came with my required apps (Amazon Prime and Internet browser). I crossed my fingers and ordered it. Lovely, crisp picture, easier controls... it is just about perfect. The only reason I can't (yet) give five stars concerns the current clumsy, slow, and unforgiving system for inputting information. It's about like texting on non-smart phones.

Setup for the TV is easy and only takes a few minutes including the time to set up the remote so that it will control your set top box.

I am very pleased with the picture quality which was my number one requirement.  As I've read other places, it lacks slightly with washed out blacks....they could be darker, but generally it is superb for its price.  I have adjusted settings to my liking and they work great for most instances.  I haven't played any video games or hooked up a computer to this yet, and as such have no opinion as to how it performs.*The reason for 4 stars....if not 3:I like the Smart Hub....but mostly only for its appearance.  I thought it mattered to me more than it does in use.  This TV has a dual core processor...and let me tell you, it is god awful slow.  My 2 year old Sony Blu-ray player loads apps and content MUCH faster than this thing.  I could boot a PC and launch youtube on it in the time it takes the youtube app to load and actually be \"ready.\"  I am not kidding.  I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the Smart features.  Being one week in with this TV, it has already had 2 updates pushed from Samsung...usually I like updates...new features and all...but I question why my new TV had two updates already.  I am at a point where I am seriously contemplating returning it and getting a similar TV from another brand that has 3D as well and is slightly cheaper.  Having compared the TVs side by side at a local store, I didnt notice much of a difference in picture quality, but was sold with the Samsung name and the Smart Hub.  I was also under the impression there were Smart Hub apps I could use on my android.....guess what, wrong.  If I had a Samsung Galaxy, then yes, but not with my other brand android.Signed,upset but patient and troubleshooting/learning if I can get past my issues with this TV.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV with a small problem", "Author": "turf", "ReviewID": "R39LS56FT27875", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think this is an excellent TV. I got it because I have a lot of chairs off center in the den where it is located and this was the best TV I found to provide a viewable picture off center, even way off center like 60 degrees to the side and 45 degrees below (it is over a high mantle). Of course, way off angle is not ideal viewing, but you can at least still see the TV instead of it blacking or whiting out at this angle like cheaper TVs do.I also like this TV since the picture quality is excellent, even during the day, in a room with a lot of windows. One thing you must do if you care about picture quality is look online on how to disable the Samsung \"auto motion plus\" feature. I think it is supposed to be better for fast motion video to cause less blurring, but it causes the \"soap opera effect\" you see a lot of people mention as a negative. I have never noticed blur on the TV without having it enabled and it is pretty dumb that it is set as the default since so many people see a Samsung TV and think it has a crummy picture due to this.I did not think I would use the smart features much since I have a PC connected to the TV, but my family watches Netflix and Amazon videos a lot on the TV and it is much more convenient to do it directly on the TV vs through the PC.The one problem I have with the TV is a stupid error message it often displays when I change the source. The only HDMI cable to the TV goes through a Sony receiver. When you change sources on the receiver, it takes a few seconds for the receiver to switch. In this time, the TV pops up a message that says \"Check the device is connected properly, then try turning on the device by selecting the button below\" with an STB (set top box) symbol and an OK button. This message stays on the screen for 60 seconds, blocking the content, until it either times out or you dig out the TV remote to dismiss it. It is very frustrating. I have contacted Samsung support who first wanted to know the firmware version on the TV them recommended I do a factory reset. When I asked them if that would change the delay or disable this annoying message, they said no, and admitted there was no way to disable the message. So it is something I live with but makes me rate this otherwise excellent TV 4 stars instead of 5. One thing a friend recommended was to make a macro sequence on my Harmony remote to quickly dismiss it, but I have not figured out how to do this yet.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV.

We did:  The 'unplug it and see if that fixes anything.' The 'Press the on button from behind' (I didn't even know that button was there). While 'off' I can see the TV on the network. Guess it is only in a coma. Samsung repair service is to call and schedule an appointment to come work on it. Any physical damage voids warranty. I'm to have it in an area where they can work on it. Sure hope they like my living room carpet as their repair area.Update: Repairman came two days later. Replaced the part in error.

After calibration, it looks 9/10 to me.  I turn off all of the \"auto\" junk in the menus, then downloaded free calibration videos (they are freeware ones out there), and calibrated white/black/tint/color levels.  Almost impossible to calibrate correctly with the auto settings are turned on.After about 2-3 months the TV would occasionally reboot.  I figured it was a software problem and it'll be fixed in the next upgrade, but the problem kept getting worse, until the unit would just reboot endlessly.  So I called Samsung.Their support STINKS.  If you tell someone you'll respond within 24 hours, then respond within 24 hours.  If you tell someone you'll call them back, then call them back.  It's amazing how many companies don't do what they'll say.  Anyway, I fill out there support form, took a video of the problem and uploaded with the form (which is a great idea, got to give them credit for that), and explained in DETAILS the problem.3 days later they shoot me an email with 4 troubleshooting steps (which are brainless) AND close my ticket without a resolution!So I do their troubleshooting... reset the TV, update the firmware (it was already updated), unplug the TV for 5 minutes.  Stuff you know isn't going to matter.  Of course, the problem isn't fixed.Now I have to go back through their online system, 3 days go by, nobody calls me, so I call them.  Tech walks me through 30 minutes of troubleshooting, even though I referenced the original ticket which explained this was already all done.  She finally tells me they'll have to send service out.  Yeah, no kidding!Come on Samsung, I know you can do better. It's *not* *that* *hard*.I'll give props to the local service company, Gibson TV, in Roseville Michigan.  The girl there e-mailed me the very following morning that Samsung opened a service ticket, said she already ordered the part based on my description of the issue, because it's a common problem (after Samsung denied it was a common problem).  The part came in in a couple of days, Gibson TV called me back to set up the service call.  They were professional, ON TIME, and fixed the TV in about 15 minutes.

May be it's the connectivity in the area where I live but the connection drops once in a while. The annoying thing however is that sometimes the TV does not reconnect to the wifi automatically when the connection is back up and running.

Which is also very straight forward using the menu from the provided remote. It is WiFi connected to our home network and through it to the internet, and this was perhaps the longer process for having to enter the WiFi data (SSID, security type and password) using the scroll button in the remote to work with the on screen keyboard. The configuration process is actually very friendly an intuitive, and uses graphics in the source and connecting ports configuration, that look very much like what you have on the back and side of the TV as connection ports, so it's difficult to make a wrong choice.During the setup process being connected to the internet, it detected a new firmware update and I let it perform the upgrade (it takes a little while, from 20 to 30 minutes). That went without incidents, and the configuration parameters didn't change in my case.By early afternoon we were already watching content from the internet (crackle, Netflix, and some other stuff available through the menu). We also watched an old DVD movie (1080p @ 60Hz) and the image was very crisp, we haven't yet bought any Blu-Ray movie (1080p @120Hz) so I'll update on that some other time.

It worked great out of the box, easy to setup and found my wifi network immediately. It even did a software update.The picture quality is great with no detectable distortion when viewing from a reasonable angle to the side. The picture adjustments allow all sorts of combinations to suit, and one of the best features is the sound modulation which pretty much eliminates those obnoxiously load commercials everyone hates - no more diving for the remote. The sound level control also allows very fine adjustments.Connections for devices seem to provide everything you'll need if I knew what they were all for. All I have is a Wii and an old DVD player which have the composite and component connections. I'll have to get a blue ray DVD with HDMI connection if I want to connect the Wii and the DVD at the same time as there is only room for one of those with provided connections.Another great plus is the reception we're now getting from our over-the-air antenna (no cable for us). With the old set and a digital to analog converter box we were constantly rotating the roof mount power antenna for best reception, or sometimes any reception at all on some stations depending on weather. We have not had to adjust the antenna at all since connecting this TV.The on screen program guide is much more complete than what the old analog TV gave us - more shows, more channels with more times, just a little slow to load sometimes.The speakers seem OK but I've ordered a surround sound bar and can't wait to watch a movie with it.We've waited a long time to catch up to technology and am glad we waited for this set.

I have the TV on a table though, not mounted so I can't speak to how easy/difficult it may be to mount.  The TV instantly recognized my wireless network and walked me through customizing everything.  It has a ton of apps but right now I primarily only use Netflix and Pandora.  Both have been working very well.  One of my favorite aspects is that the Samsung remote fully controls not only the TV but also my Verizon Fios set top box.  No more shuffling between remotes.  Verizon \"On Demand\" as well the dvr functions can be accessed fully from the Samsung remote.  A small benefit, but one I definitely appreciate.  I'm still working on finding the correct calibration.

The only assembly required is attaching the stand which is done so with 4 screws that are included, and took all of 2 minutes to do.  Unpacking the contents is equally easy to do, and while the instructions say you should use 2 people to take out of the box and setup, I was able to do so by myself.The picture quality has to be seen to be believed.  My wife who loves the classic black and white movies, could not believe how fluid the picture and how clear everything was.  In fact the day I set it up, I was watching a tv commercial, and was just mesmerized by how good the picture quality was.  The picture quality gives a very life like in motion effect to everything which is as I said, has to be seen to be believed just how good it is.  I play a lot of games and watch a lot of sports, and both of those things are equally as impressive as tv and movies.About the apps, wow is all I can say.  They all load right up quickly, and 2 of the more used ones by my wife (Netflix and Amazon) have their own button on the remote.  My wife and I watch a lot of Netflix and Amazon Prime video as well as Hulu Plus, and all of them run flawlessly on this tv.  I want to clarify that the Amazon video is in fact the \"REAL\" prime video player and not the regular amazon video player so Prime members like myself are obviously very happy with this.The inputs on the back of the tv are well laid out and can be easily accessed.  There are numerous HDMI inputs, and USB inputs as well as a composite video input and and optical audio port.  The audio on the tv is nothing mind blowingly awesome, but it is good.  It i clear, and an acceptable level of bass.  I plan on eventually setting up a home theater for audio but for now I am satisfied with whats there.  There are multiple audio options you can run with to try and see what is best for your environment.One last thing I think that is worth mentioning is the screen glare, there is very very very little of it.  I have a bright lamp in the back corner of my living room and while on my old tv, the glare was very noticable, it is not on this tv.  The screen has a very good finish that reduces the amount of light reflection so viewing it even in bright rooms is not an issue.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Christmas present to myself...", "Author": "Shopping Queen", "ReviewID": "R3AP8P4BTJKOC6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgrading from a 32\" Panasonic to the 55\" Samsung.

It's a fab TV in every way except this one MAJOR problem which is that it makes an insane amount of noise when turned on, and even sometimes when it's off.  Keeps me from wanting to turn it on half the time.  Maybe we got a bad apple.UPDATE: Changing my rating!!  We finally got around to calling Samsung about the buzzing noise.  Had an easy time with customer service and had a technician out to look at it within a few days.  The technician replaced the power supply for us - apparently it's not unheard of for the power supply to be/go bad and this is what causes the buzzing when the TV is off but plugged in or turned on.  No dice.  Then he suggested running an extension cord to plug it into a GFCI protected outlet in our kitchen.  BINGO!  We had tried other outlets but didn't think to bring it into a different room to get the GFCI.  I've updated my two-star review to a full five; as I said, the TV is great without the buzzing noise!  So, don't be an idiot like I was - if your Samsung is buzzing and you don't know why, try plugging it into a GFCI protected outlet - you'll usually have one either in the bathroom or kitchen if you don't have em elsewhere.

I wasn't interested in 3D or many of the higher end features.  I was just looking for a good form factor that would mount nicely above my mantle.  So far I am pretty happy with it.Look:The picture looks good, the bezel is fairly thin and somewhat translucent looking, so it disappears when viewing the TV. Compared to my original Samsung, the contrast is much better. As I have purchased tv's, they tend to always have a better picture from year to year, and I can say that this is the best looking in my home at the moment.  I did take a few minutes to adjust the picture settings based on my preferences and some settings others have posted as suggestions.Wireless:This has the ability to join your wireless network for some of it's features.  I ended up moving an access point a little closer to it so that it got a stronger signal, but I have been using it wirelessly for both Amazon videos and streaming videos from a DLNA server on my network.  Both work well in my setup. (a wired connection would probably be better in most cases when possible)Features:I have this TV fed from a TivoHD, so I havn't used most of the smart TV features.  As I mentioned in the wireless section, it does well getting content from a DLNA server, although it can be slow to get to the content you are looking for if you have a lot of videos.Sound:I am impressed by the sound.  A decent soundbar would be better, but this TV has the best sound of all my flat panels. There is a setting in the setup that you tell the TV how it is mounted (stand or wall mount).  I have flipped the settings and have not been able to tell a difference.

The color, contrast, motion and crispness are very impressive.  The experience is like seeing a wall-size Monet start moving.  On top of that, the first-time walk-through setup experience was very user friendly and entertaining.That segue's well into the functionality and versatility of the SmartTV.  The system is so rich that I've since disconnected both my Roku & Chromecast.  Samsung's versions of apps like HBOGo , Netflix & YouTube are first-rate, higher quality experiences than those on Roku/Chromecast.To add a cherry on top, the TV is absolutely quiet (I used to have a buzzy plasma) and runs perfectly cool at room temperature.  This matters to me a lot since the house heats up a lot in the summer time and I like to watch TV late with the volume low.This TV was definitely worth the price.

SInce this was going to be a one time purchase, I wanted to make sure I get the best one at a good price.First bet is to buy this off amazon, you will easily save atleast 100$. The ones in Best Buy and other retailers in store cost atleast a 100$ more. This was a 2013 model and had the latest updates and software in it. The  TV is pretty fast and the Wifi is great. The sound quality is good as well except for trouble with Netflix where you need to turn up the volume. This is a problem with most smart TVs, so I would not really worry about it. This samsung smart tv outperforms others in that dept., though you still need to raise the volume, its not as much as for other TVs. Lots of smart apps and everything works great. Picture clarity and the 120Hz makes the motion and screen look awesome. Installation is easy and overall appearance is great.The negative apart from the sound is with the youtube app, after playing around a couple of videos, a bland screen starts showing up even though you hear the sound playing in the background. You switch off the TV and restart and it works fine. I wonder what this is. But use your HDMI cable for all this, its much easier to handle than the Youtube app here unless your really lazy but willing to play with the remote to do your searches. The sound is best when watching in movie mode, for intense movies with lots of dialouges, use the other options. The videos and movies look great when watching on TV rather than on the laptop, so use your nice High Speed HDMI cable for most of your uses.Updates:There is a easier way out of the Youtube problem. This TV comes equipped with the All Share Play for Samsung devices, so you can view your phone on the TV via screen mirroring. Besides, it allows you to share and view photos, videos on the TV just via Wifi connection. And for Youtube, just pair your device and do all the searches you need and watch videos with greater ease.End Verdict: Totally worth the buy. Best Smart TV in its category.

This is the most customer-dependent aspect of the television.

For me the roughly $175 premium I was paying for smart features was worth the price because a good Roku costs just as much, and while a ChromeCast is only $35 it does not stream every service I would want to use. It was quick and easy to apply my Netflix, Pandora, and HboGo settings to the TV.audio - the speakers of the TV are slightly above average. Passable, not great. I got a Samsung 2.1 soundbar system which is easy to use through the TV interface.Internet connectivity - I did not try to use WiFi since a router is directly behind my television.

I wish I had known prior to purchasing, but this TV cannot output 5.1 surround sound via the SPDIF/TOSLINK optical audio out connection when the signal originates from HDMI.  What does this mean?  It means that if you have an older AV receiver like I do, you don't have enough HDMI inputs, and you'll connect all your devices to the TV first, then run an audio cable from the TV to the receiver.  When connecting this way, anything that is connected via HDMI will output in 2 channel stereo only.  So your cable/satellite box, PS4, Xbox or Blu-Ray player will be in stereo and not 5.1.  However anything originating on the TV, for example Netflix, Hulu, etc, can output in 5.1 surround.2. The colors of this set are washed out when viewing off-angle.  Sitting directly in front of it is fantastic, but there is noticeable degradation of color saturation when you're viewing from the sides.3. While the smart hub is a nice feature, it's still somewhat lacking.  Apps are little slow to respond and menus lag, probably due to the CPU being under-powered.  The 'recommended' apps are locked and cannot be uninstalled or moved.

The remote has a button that will backlight most of the buttons for a few seconds, but only after a button is pressed (and pressing the button to toggle the lighting does not trigger this).  It's a nice idea, but rather impractical because you can't turn on the lighting without already having to press a button.The TV is a little sluggish loading apps, but loads Plex content significantly faster than my Roku 3 (Netflix is about the same).  I found the windows media server feature to be rather poor (slow, hard to navigate, and unable to play some of the files that it could play if a HDD was directly connected).  Plex solves most of that shortcoming.Some of the apps are a little unresponsive because they hang while waiting for certain processing events.

I had absolutely no interest in 3D capabilities but did want to enter the smart TV age. After months of research and waiting for a price break during the holiday, I committed to Samsung's UN55F6300 and could not be any more satisfied.Upon delivery, the television was inspected and found to have arrived in factory condition. The only bit of assembly required was installing the base to the monitor and that, in itself, was super simple.When I turned it on, I went through the steps required to setup today's smart TV functions and, I must say, Samsung has done a great job creating a user interface that is easy to use understand and even easier to use. Within minutes, I was enjoying some high definition programming in absolutely stunning picture!The television, in its own right, is very sleek. The bezel is thin with a nice tint that gives the picture a good border that is none-too-large. The stand provides the ability to rotate the horizontal angle of the screen and provides a study base that does not feel flimsy at all.Samsung's smart TV interface has been widely recognized as one of the best in the industry and provides quick access to various applications which turn this television into an even greater entertainment experience - none of which do you have to ever use or interact with if you do not desire.For picture quality, I did a simple search on the internet to find adjustment settings that have been recommended by professionals who have the equipment to properly fine tune a television. Making the adjustments correlate with the suggested settings was a breeze and, in my opinion, really did enhance the viewing quality. For gamers, the 'game' setting can be set for a specific input source and will maintain that setting with no need to repeatedly flip back and forth when you switch between TV and gaming. That is: all settings correspond to the input source you have selected, providing the opportunity to create an array of picture settings, depending on the input device you are using.The remote - although it lacks the neat stylis-like feature of the more expensive models - does what you need it to do. Unfortunately, the backlighting for the button could be brighter; but, when your eyes are glued to the beauty of the television screen, the dim yellow hue of the remote is the last thing you will be thinking about. Quick access to Netflix and Amazon on demand features allows you to access your video libraries at the click of a button.The Wi-Fi receiver for this television seems to operate wonderfully. My television is downstairs in a partially underground, spit-level home while my wireless router resides upstairs - the television picks up on the signal and maintains a connection without any troubles.While I wish there was an older RCA input for this television, there is an adequate amount of HDMIs and one component input for an assortment of DVD/Blu-ray, video gaming and other devices.Although I did test sound through the onboard speakers to ensure they worked, I did not spend much time evaluating their quality before hooking up my sound system. Sound through the digital output is crisp, clean and in sync with the picture.Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with this television and have expectations that it will last many, many years in our household. With the Samsung name, I have come expect quality and this set fulfills all of those expectations and then some.If you are in the market for a television, have no need for 3D features, and do not wish to sacrifice picture quality at the expense of a smaller price tag, I encourage you to consider this television and to take advantage of Amazon's excellent delivery service.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buzzing, faulty TV with terrible service", "Author": "Home Theater Enthusiast", "ReviewID": "R2ACKZLWL9LED7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this Samsung TV to replace a another Samsung TV that was less than two years old before it started failing.

If you want this TV for the picture and the 'Smart' aspect of it....I would think twice. The quality of the applications on this TV are pretty horrid. Not sure if this is Samsung's fault, or if it's just some third party developer, so I'll give Samsung the benefit of the doubt.Outside of the apps themselves the Smart 'hub' is pretty poorly designed. After turning on the TV the Smart application won't be able to launch for quite a while. I know this TV isn't a supercomputer or anything, but there's definitely quite the delay on startup that could sometimes become aggravating.Secondly, the updating system for the Smart application is probably the worst part about this TV . There have been many times where the TV does not respond to ANY button presses because it is updating. The light on the television responds to the remote presses but absolutely nothing will happen with the tv...even if you press the power button, nothing will happen. I believe that it is this updating that is causing this because the only time this happens is when the smart application has to update (which is a lot, unfortunately). I'm not sure if this ties up the hard drive or what, but when the TV is updating, everything slows to a halt. I timed it, and while it was updating I pressed the 'Source' button on the remote, and the source menu took about 10 seconds until it showed...and then I couldn't switch inputs because that was taking forever too.All in all, if I could return this TV, I would. If you REALLY want this TV as well as the ability to use apps, I would suggest getting a non-'smart' version with USB/HDMI input and get a Roku or something similar. Otherwise you're going to have a hell of a time getting this TV to work properly.Some additional info on the apps' issues (didn't take off stars for these, just reporting the problem for future buyers), I have full bars for 5GHz and 2.4GHz during these issues, tried both frequencies, and have tried with QoS on/off on my router as well: Netflix app sound randomly cuts out. Does it intermittently, but enough to where it is quite noticeable and can leave out important dialogue. The YouTube application is pretty horrendous, you will watch a video, and then out of nowhere the video will get stuck at a part but the audio will keep playing...almost as if it is buffering, but clearly it's not as the audio is still playing with the timer on the interface.All in all I think that it definitely has the potential to be a great 'Smart' TV, but falls short due to the poor design of the entire 'Smart' system. As stated earlier, I would suggest getting a 'dumb' version of this TV, and then use something like a Roku box or Chromecast for your 'Smart' needs.TL;DR-The quality of the picture is awesome, but the 'Smart' application has too many problems. So many that it (in my opinion) carries over and affects the regular television operation. Get a dumb version of this TV with usb/hdmi and get some sort of streaming device (Roku/Amazon Fire/Chromecast) that is much more reliable than the Smart application.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Purchase I've made in the last 2 years", "Author": "War_Eagle1983", "ReviewID": "R3FSJ3O0NZ9RQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is incredible.

That meant that the built in Wifi was one of the main features I was after, unfortunately it is absolute garbage.  I've had the TV for nine months now and despite many firmware updates in the interim the Wifi cannot remain connected for more than a few minutes.  After losing the connection the TV has to be turned on and off to reconnect.  This makes things like Netflix and Amazon Prime impossible to use.  My Wifi hotspot/router is about 20 feet away in another room and none of my other 20 or so wifi devices have any problem connecting to it.  I can even connect to my Wifi network when I'm across the street at a neighbor's house.  I have tried everything including moving the router, using a high gain antenna, etc. but nothing seems to work.  I've since given up and used an old wired-to-wireless gaming adapter that I had laying around.Having put a band-aid on the network issue I can say that otherwise this TV is pretty good.  The smart features are nice, with the exception that they pre-install a bunch of smart apps that you can't remove and will never use or want.  The available apps that you do want are pretty good and run smoothly.  However, when trying to view streaming video in the web browser the flash player chokes frequently on videos that contain interstitial ads.  Sometimes the video will resume after a while but sometimes you have to reload the page and move to the timestamp after the ad.The picture quality is great but not excellent.  It gets a 4/5 here.One nice bonus is the IR extender that makes setting up the universal remote a breeze for devices that don't support HDMI-CEC.  Unfortunately the IR commands are pretty generic across brands and devices so when turning on my a/v receiver the TV sends the on/off command about 10 times and I can hear the receiver turn on and off repeatedly.  That's definitely not good for the power supply and I'm going to have to find a new solution for that until they add the specific codes for my device to the database and I'm not forced to use the generic brand code.All in all I've had a pretty good experience with this TV but the network issue is a serious thorn in my side.

Be received the 48\" 6300 after the Cyber Monday sales last year. We had bought our last TV 10 years ago (Sony CRT 32\") and wanted to make that quantum leap up the TV food chain.From the word go this TV is awesome. First, going from the CRT to this is hard to get around. This impressed right out of the box. We had an idea of what we wanted and knew we wanted to get the most technology we could without the 3D.  We did our research and figured we didn\u2019t need the 3D the 6400 offered but wanted the smart functions. We don\u2019t have Netflix but do have Amazon Prime.I know not all experiences are good out of the box, but ours was. The TV did a software update and it was go time. Don\u2019t bother with any cables other than the HMDI. I did not have one (it did not come until later) and hooked the cable up using the old cables, the difference is striking. Also, I know there are quite a few technophiles on here with video setting tips but we were impressed with the stock settings. I may do some tinkering but I just don\u2019t know if I would care that much.We liked this TV in our bedroom so much we just ordered the 6350 60\u201d (be here tomorrow) for our living room. We have another CRT in there that is about to go to the garage. I hope the 6350 lives up to our expectations. The room is 24/26 so I figure the 60\u201d will be just fine and I just did not want to pay for the 65.The down side\u2026the TV does need a sound bar. We have not bought one because I\u2019m cheap but we will. The dialog can be hard to make out over the music and sound effects. The main speakers seem fine in our bedroom but we strain to hear when people are talking. In the larger living room with a hardwood floor this might be exacerbated. This seems to be a constant theme in the reviews so it just, \u201cis what it is\u201d when you get this TV. We have had infrequent loss on the streaming but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s my provider or the TV. I will say I have never had to call the help line.We think the TV was worth the money and hope it lasts 10 years like the last two did (does anyone want a set of nice Sony 32\u201d CRTs?)\u2026", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great picture, easy set up", "Author": "James Shover", "ReviewID": "R3216WS5GHK0DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best TV picture I have ever seen.

This can be a real pain in the butt, I am still trying to get through the user guide to see if you can lower the refresh rate from 120 Htz to 60, that will resolve that issue.The remote is not very user friendly, and becuase I have a cable box and Blu-Ray attached, there is a tendancy for the TV to \"source hop\" when cycling power.  It likes to go direct to the cable input, rather than allowing the HDMI cable to control the main TV viewing.Additionally, the audio settings for the Blu-Ray player are very different from the Cable.  I can comfortably listen to any TV Show, cable movie, or sports event with the tv volume at 9.  When playing a Blu-Ray, there is a constant struggle to adjust the volume for speaking, and lower the volume during action scenes.  I have adjusted all sound capability on the Blu-Ray, and even changed input through the many HDMI connections.  Still trying to figure that one out....The picture is clear and crisp, for normal viewing, the Smart features are a definate plus, especially with Netflix and AmazonPrime.  If you are going to use the internet feature, at all, get the wireless keyboard.  The remote is a real pain when searching etc.Additionally, I use Comcast cable, so when using the OnDemand feature, the remote does not have a back button capable of cycling back from the movie information tab to the movie list menu.  instead, you have to go all the way back to standard TV and re-enter the OnDemand menu if you decide you don't want to watch the show.So the question really is:  Is this TV under-performing and counter-intuitive, or does it just do so many other things that they forgot the simple every day features we may take for granted?", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent product", "Author": "Luis", "ReviewID": "RP06P4LNIXMFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the TV is very good, meets my expectations in terms of technological applications, I like much the application that allows you to connect to other computers Samsung, such as to view pictures and video from my phone to the TV screen, I note that it has no digital channel selector as other brands have it.

TV's of this class have never been cheaper.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs.

(reboots) but I have to manually turn it back on.  this is a big problem.  let's say you are watching a movie from your blu ray and you want to switch source, the TV does not respond...shuts down.  & let's say you were watching a streeming movie on one of the apps, you want to adjust picture, hit the menu button, and the TV shuts down...now you have to turn the TV back on, go back to the app, find the movie you were watching, & resume. WTF?..verry aggravating .The Apps; using the apps i find that they also freeze up. and when ordering HD movies on most apps, the format is not presented in full screen.  (get the black bars on top & bottom or sides)  also the streaming part sucks! it buffers and says \" EXIT PLAYBACK or EXIT APP\".  again this is very aggravating!  with my pansonic blu ray player with vara cast (online apps) I can stream movies without any issues. connected wireless through a netgear router and receiving 10-12 mbps download speed on all my devices throughout my network. so, the Samsung TV should not have any issues but,...it does!The picture;  the picture quality is good connected through dish network satellite set top box.  I have no issues with picture formating for the set top box will allow you to change format options.  I have the TV contacted by HDMI cable from settop box and to my home theater receiver .  audio is good!I contacted Samsung Customer support about these issues and the first time, they instructed me over the phone to do a manual firmware update & reset my smarthub.  they said that should take care of the issues....it did not!  second time calling, I was on hold for over 30 min. to speak to the \"remote assistance\" dept.  once I finally got someone on the phone, they instructed me to get the code from the TV, and read it to him so as he can have remote access to my TV to diagnose the TV.  he then said he would have to set up an appointment for a service call.  as of the date of this review I am still waiting for the service call and will update once that has been done with the results.Bottom line;  too many problems from a new out-of-the-box TV!

So Amazon it was.  The TV arrived in excellent condition and was very easy to set up with most controls and menus very intuitive.  The picture is excellent.  One item that did suprise me was how good the broadcast (antenna) picture is when compared to ComCast HD cable service.  When switching between the Antenna signal and the equivalent ComCast HD 1080p signal channel (the SuperBowl in this example), the ComCast picture is relatively muddy.  The WiFi connection was easy to configure to connect to my home network.  I have only explored a small subset of the Smart capabilities of the TV ... very extensive.  I have been able to play / display many different picture and video formats on the set.  The TV has an audio out that I port directly to my stereo ... very convenient in that regadless of the input chosen as source for the TV, the stereo settings remain the same.  Last comment ... I wanted to keep my VCR capability; but since the VCR only has a single composite video out, this TV only has a shared composite / component input; but does have 4 HDMI inputs.  Since I was using the component input for another device there was no easy way to connect the VCR.  I looked at many component to HDMI up converters on Amazon -- most were about $50 with questionable ratings.  I ended up buying a Toshiba DVR620 which has a built in HDMI 1080p up converter and has the ability to copy / read and write both VHS tapes and DVD's for about $170.

We're average home TV watchers, not particularly in tune with all the all the technical details and features some people demand.  I just can't justify paying thousands of dollars for a television with features I won't notice, or use.  For our purposes, this one meets or exceeds our expectations, and the price was right.  If you're really picky about technicals, maybe this TV isn't for you.The TV arrived within 48 hours via UPS, shipped by Amazon within a box inside another box, well packed/cushioned to protect the TV from damage in shipment.  Sold by Amazon, with free prime shipping. NOTE: The price had been fluctuating some $200 up and down since Black Friday, so wait it out, and buy it from Amazon.I paired the Samsung 46\" with a Sanus VLF525, which is made for much larger TV's, however the Sanus allows me to move the TV completely perpendicular to the wall, a true 90 degree angle.  So I can pull the TV away from the wall, and turn it a full 90 degrees which was a requirement to meet our needs.Setup was relatively easy.  The initial power up walks you though a menu of items.  It connected to my Wifi router about 25 feet away after adding the router password. We subscribe to FIOS, and the Samsung Remote controls the FIOS set top box with very few limitations (power, channel change, STB Menu, and STB Guide, etc. work fine).  However, the FIOS remote doesn't work for controlling most of the Samsung features, so we primarily use the Samsung remote.  Despite what Comcast and FIOS say, they've made watching TV way too complex by forcing STB's and Digital Adapters in the mix.Screen image is crisp and clear, we don't notice any ghosting or motion related issues sitting about 8 to 10 feet from the screen.

I did much research before the purchase.  It is an upgrade from a 2008 LG 720p tv and the results with this tv are amazing.  The initial set up was very fast and within 10 minutes the tv was up and running, in control of my cable dvr box and hooked up to the internet.  The user has a lot of options for picture adjustments to make it to their liking.  I tried many posted here but I like my picture bright and vibrant so I keep mine in the standard mode and just upped the backlight a little.  Important to note, this tv does have a glossy screen but I have it in a room which is bright with sunlight during the day and I have lights on at night.  The tv does not reflect any of this.  I only dim the lights for atmosphere when watching a dark or scary movie.Many complain about the black level with this tv.  I find it to be excellent and when shows fade to black my screen is fully black.  The colors with this tv are also exceptional and realistic.  I very rarely use any aspect of the auto motion plus.  The true 120hz of this tv provides a picture of amazing clarity and depth.  I do keep the digital clean view on auto which keeps everything crisp.  As others have stated it often feels like people on the tv are in your room or that you are immersed in a movie the picture is so great.For me the smart features are pretty much great.  I am connected to the internet via ethernet and do have a high internet speed.  I can use the browser, Netflix and Amazon Prime all with no problem.  My Netflix and Amazon never buffers or has problems loading.  I also use Pandora and the Amazon Cloud Player for music.  Apps are always up and running with no problem.  My tv updated itself with initial setup and there was one more update at the end of November.  Everything always went smoothly.The tv is very attractive.  It's slim design is very sleek and I like the stand which some find a little flimsy.  I do have a couple of issues.  One, the audio is not good at all and I had to get a sound bar.  But this is an issues with all led tvs.  With Netlflix the picture I get is just as good as with the regular tv setting.  With my Amazon Prime some shows, even Downton Abbey come in a little lackluster.  Luckily I can access Amazon thru my blu ray player as well and the picture is great if I so desire.  But luckily its not on all shows and this is really the only problem of note I've encountered.I also want to say that I needed to cantact Samsung support twice and was very impressed.  One time was about the Amazon video issue and a tech remotely went into my tv and un/reinstalled the app to try to get it better.  Sadly it didn't help but they tried everything possible to help.Also please be sure when purchasing this tv that under the price it says SHIPS FROM AND SOLD BY AMAZON.  When Amazon themselves are out of stock third party sellers will toy with the price often to outrageous amounts and only if you truly buy it from Amazon do you get their excellent customer support, delivery and 30 day tech support for the tv,.  Amazon themselves stand behind their products 1000% and returns if necessary are simple.  Don't be fooled into buying from a third party seller.I love this tv and highly recommend it.  The simple bonuses like it giving me recommendations based on my viewing habits are fun.  And being able to use only the tv remote for the tv and cable box  which also changes the channel, sets recordings etc. is superb.  And for picture quality you really can't get much better.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "The TV is great.", "Author": "C.

I  just wanted  to make it slightly smaller. Two channels (one a shopping channel) have writing off to the side that is cut off. The options were.....fit to screen, 6.9 which was the best size, and the others were square options which I don't need.  I really enjoyed watching YouTube videos on the larger screen and movies. The TV also has a nice sleep timer with many choices.  Other than a slightly off picture size on those two channels (could be the channel's fault), I can't find anything wrong with this.

There was no comparison with the picture quality even after following some of the settings suggested by other purchasers of this product. There was just no way I would be satisfied with the Vizio. After a few days of misery, I found the Samsung 60\" smart on Amazon for $1167 and immediately purchased it via my Prime account. It arrived in a few days, I set it up, tweaked the settings a little, and never looked back. This TV IS AWESOME and I'm a very happy camper. Took the Vizio back to Walmart and they asked what was wrong with it. I told them the picture sucks and that I'm fairly tech savvy and nothing I did would produce a satisfactory picture. To be fair to Vizio owners, an associate at work purchased the same model Vizio on the same day and he loves it.....maybe I just got a lemon.

Amazon did a beautiful job packing it. You would have thought I bought a 70'' TV because the outside box was so big, and be ready for a whopping four trash bags filled with packing material. There were absolutely no dings, dents, or holes on the outside box, so UPS did an amazing job with shipping.You know when you go into Wal-Mart and you see that \"life-like\" television that's ridiculously priced? Yeah, that's this TV but a lot more affordable. WAIT for this Television to go on sale, I got mine as a Cyber Monday deal with 52% off (Or $650 purchase price) If you're willing to open up another credit card, I'd also recommend the Amazon Store Card by G.E. Capital. With that credit card, you receive a certain time-frame with zero interest, and with this TV it's 48 months. However, the major downside is if you go outside of that time-frame, you accrue interest from when you bought the TV.I personally decided to mount my TV, and I also have an \"older\" 5.1 surround sound also by Samsung. I really like this TV with 4 HDMI ports. That's perfect for me, with my DirecTV box, my 360, my Xbox One, and my PS4. I also like the optical sound port, my 5.1 takes it, and it sounds beautiful. As far as weight goes, it's surprisingly light, I think my old 32'' TV weighed the same.As far as video games go, they all look really beautiful. Anything from Gears of War 3, to Battlefield 4, KillZone Shadow Fall, and Ryse, they all look really really good. This TV has minimal motion blur and several picture settings, so you can get that perfect picture for any game. There is a \"game mode\" where it accelerates the picture from your console to the TV, but I don't really use it.Even though this is a \"Smart TV\" I don't use any of it's features. I have three different consoles that can access everything I need \"on demand\". Instead of using the Samsung remote as my primary remote, I decided to use my DirecTV remote instead.I personally upgraded from a 32'' 720p LCD TV by Emerson.

The picture is phenomenal and easily one of the best I saw in the store. I was a little sceptical at first because I read several reviews that bashed the App's on the TV, but I have found zero problems with them. Maybe it was because I allowed my TV to update right when I got it. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon all work great. I also played a video off a flash drive with no problem at all. This TV, however, doesn't have the best of sound quality. Don't get me wrong, it's passable and doesn't often bother me, but I will definitely be picking up a speaker system sometime soon. I recommend staying away from audio profiles too (Like movie, voice, etc). I was watching the latest Bond with it, and there was some audio artifacting going on.

This Samsung 32inch tv seriously BLOWS it out of the water and looks so crisp and beautiful in my room. It was exactly what a wanted: a 32inch, 1080p, true 120hertz(clear motion of 240), and LED. This tv really looks physically beautiful with how slim it is and its thin silver frame. With a variety of picture settings to play with that can be somewhat of a headache at times, I found several different calibration settings around the net and adjusted them a little more to my taste in Movie mode. The ability to set the 10-point white balance adjustment made a major difference. Now, even basic cable looks 'almost' HD, Crysis3 on my PS3 looked phenomenal with deep blacks and beautiful picture, Hulu/Netflix HD is very detailed, and Blue ray is just spectacular in every category.Smart TV:I wasn't really into the whole smart tv aspect since I run several of the same apps through my PS3 and I felt that labeling it as \"smart\" just allows Samsung to charge more to the customers.However, now that I have used it and gotten to browse many of its features, it works very well and makes for a seamless viewing experience being able to switch from cable->netflix->hulu with just a few buttons. Using the control to type and search for content is much better than I expected, though a keyboard/mouse would obviously be much better. It also has a very nice feature where if I ever want to rent or buy a movie, I just pull up the \"Movie/TV Show\" frame of the smarthub and a huge variety of content is waiting for me to be rented. The price is higher then redbox or other rental services, but you can't beat the convenience of having all this in your tv.So far I cannot think of any cons, except maybe that the base of the tv is a little funky looking and the price is a bit high for a 32 inch(the model below this was 60hertz and no smart hub for $480). Other than that, it's true what they say in that you get what you pay for and this Samsung tv is exactly what I was looking for and exceeded my expectations, well worth the extra cash.

When I explained that it would take me over an hour to remove the TV to get the \"letter\", they said sorry, it was company policy. I pleaded saying it was just like the other two Samsung remotes in my home...once again, no letter, no remote. I appealed for a supervisor, was placed on hold for ten minutes, then finally told a supervisor would call me back. Hours later, I found a message on my phone from a supervisor who said she was returning my call, that I should call back at my convieniance, but left no return number.I called the number on my caller id.

I bought the Samsung HD Smart TV (Model# UN75F6300) on Amazon, and it worked fine for the first couple months. In the third month, it developed a \"stuck pixel\", whereas an ever-present blue dot would appear on the screen. Over time, it continues to get worse, brighter & more noticeable. I contacted Samsung & they informed me this was considered \"within specs\" and there was nothing they would do to fix it...that it \"may\" fix itself. Over a month later, as mentioned, it has gotten worse. When I purchased the TV, I had an expectation to get enjoyment out of it for more than a couple short months, especially after spending several thousand dollars on it. Samsung essentially told me that even though I just spent over $3K on a new television that was shown to have a manufacturer defect, I must basically just deal with it. Afterall, they already have my money. Unfortunately, Amazon was not able to provide any assistance. Needless to say, I will not purchase any large electronics from Amazon again, and I will most assuredly never buy a Samsung product ever again.

Then, to make things even better, the delivery company Amazon uses, calls me two days prior to delivery, and indicates they were ahead of their schedule, and would I like to have the TV delivered a day earlier -- What a nice surprise!The one-man delivery crew arrived on-time, removed all of the box materials, plugged-in the TV to ensure it worked, and can you believe this, he even helped me remove my old, heavy (just under 100 lbs.) plasma TV from the wall before he left.  Now that IS excellent service!The TV had no blemishes or scratches and worked well out of the box.  I fine-tuned my TV picture settings from recommendations on this TV's page on Amazon, as well as some adjustment recommendations on CNET.Overall, an excellent picture for a 65\" Samsung; I have several older (and smaller) Samsung's throughout my house, this being the largest and I continue to be pleased with Samsung products.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it, I love it, I love it", "Author": "N.

The night I got it, it took about 10 minutes to get set up in the living room, and was able to watch the NBA playoffs in HD within half an hour after updating the TV. I ran a side by side comparison with this TV and a Panasonic plasma 720p TV (quite old, perhaps c. 2003) and the difference was amazing. The Samsung TV was so incredibly vibrant that I had to turn down the brightness a little so as to hopefully not burn out the TV in the long run.I am a gamer, so having a TV that isn't able to keep up with the action wasn't going to cut it. This TV with its 240 CMR is more than capable of capture all the fast paced action. In particular, I hooked up my PS3 to the TV and threw in Black Ops 2. The picture was flawless. And surprisingly, the internal speakers were able to give me a subtle sense of sounds coming from left or right, almost as if it had surround sound built in (foolish I know).The only thing that concerns me is trying to display the screen from my 2011 Macbook Pro onto the TV. I purchased a HDMI to Mini Display Port adapter from Amazon and when I initially plugged in my computer to the TV, the picture on the TV appeared almost like static. I could still read text on the TV and it was still fairly clear, but when I tried to watch Star Trek, the static was too much to overlook. Of course I tried several different resolution settings, but nothing worked. So I tried to use a different HDMI cable, and after 2 more cables, it was finally a perfect picture. Dunno if the problem was the HDMI cable, the TV, or the Macbook, but the problem is solved now. I just don't understand why a different HDMI cable produced a different picture...As for the smart features on the TV, I have yet to stream Netflix or anything like that, but when I tried to watch Family Guy on Hulu, the video just wouldn't buffer. It may be my internet, but I was able to easily stream Hulu on my Macbook...so the processing power is something to investigate.Overall, if you're in the market for a high quality TV with premium picture and above average sound, then this TV is worth the extra money. You'll be spending the next 5 years at least with this kind of product, so throwing a little extra money toward the purchase is worth it. Although a Vizio brand is far cheaper, Samsung's product is first class in my opinion. Definitely spend the extra money so you'll be happy for years to come.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks great, but that doesn't make up for its other shortcomings", "Author": "CK3", "ReviewID": "R1B83B2II1Q9DE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Up until last month I have had a 32 inch tube TV and felt it was time to treat myself.  I have used dual Samsung LED monitors on my PC and was happy with their quality, so choosing Samsung based on that and their Smart Hub seemed logical.  So far I am only marginally pleased with my purchase and had to go through some lengthy customer service hoops to get an issue resolved.Pros:- Looks great, no blur, or ghosting, crisp, & bright if you change the settings yourself.  What I expected from a Samsung LED.- Smart hub has a good look and feel, but that is it.- Samsung Customer support was helpful.Cons:- Slooooooow.  The Smart hub is slow.  Streaming apps are so very slow, like trying to navigate in slow motion.  It can take up to a minute to get Netflix, Amazon, or YouTube streaming loaded. (first world problems)- Crashes.  1/3 of the time, after waiting a minute to load Netflix, it will crash, please try again... a few tries.  (I am up to date with the latest firmware and apps.)- Loses network connectivity constantly.  My TV is mounted on the wall with my wireless router in the room behind it, 10 ft away, with just one wall.  I'll try to load Amazon or other Apps (wait a minute, crash, Oh no! network connectivity lost!)  Then you have to click retry 5 or 6 times to re-establish wireless connection.  Everything else in my house is wireless with full bars and no issues like this.- Not much room to plug in Digital Audio cable when wall mounted.- Random green/purple screen when streaming.  Usually when using YouTube, but sometimes Netflix or Amazon, I will start to play a video and the screen immediately goes all green and purple blocking, about 5% of the time.  The affect the TV until it is turned off completely and then back on again.  Annoying, and possibly another lengthy customer service process.- TV Sensor issue.  My TV came with a faulty controller sensor where the TV controller works, but only 40% of the time would the TV read the signals.  Meaning I could turn on the TV with remote, but 5min later I couldn't change channels, I would not be able to use the remote for hours (getting up and using the TV buttons).  Then hours later the sensor would function again.  The sensor was eventually replaced after a few weeks and has worked now for the past few days (a good sign).I contacted Samsung customer support and was mostly pleased with my experience.  My call was answered promptly, the techs were clear, and while we had to run through the troubleshooting scripts a few times, as expected, they escalated my issue until it was resolved.I think Samsung has some work to do making their Smart Hub and applications used with it faster, and they have some quality control issue to work out too.At this point I am not recommending this Samsung TV.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great picture...Terrible sound!", "Author": "Peggy Osley", "ReviewID": "R1XJ6BSVLZ0JZI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great picture quality, but the sound quality is terrible.

The thing is, the box looked pristine. The TV obviously couldn't have been damaged during transit. Someone clearly put a damaged TV in the box and shipped it to me. Not cool.

The TV looked great and showed no physical damage, but when it was powered on for the first time it was stunningly apparent that something was really wrong with the internals.  There were narrow, colored vertical lines from top to bottom on the left side of the screen, part of the setup screen could be seen on the right side of the screen but even that was \"scratchy\" looking and not all there, but the worst part was this sort of crazy white-gray section that looked like a work of abstract art and took up about half the screen in the middle of the screen.  It looked like someone had punched the screen near the bottom, just left of center, and that the damage went out from that point, but not in a linear fashion in the least.  And again, until it was powered on, the TV looked perfect.  Clearly the TV was already damaged prior to being packaged and shipped, and this really doesn't say good things about Samsung's quality control.The bottom line was a disappointed customer, a refused delivery, a cancelled Amazon order, and a restart of the TV search process.

However when you call who makes the TV, Samsung you'll learn the truth. Another way you can find out about the refresh rate is reading this review. Ok, so the clear motion rate is about the same as hz when discussing the actual speed of the TV's refresh rate. The clear motion rate for this TV is between 240-480, so it at least has a refresh rate of 240hz. Next, comes the 480, the 480 is the max level your TV can handle. Theirs a little problem though, nothing can even reach that level of clarity. HD Top of the line 3D Blue-ray players don't even come close, their actually limited to what ever movie your watching. This is kind of like how they can make old movies a little clearer by adding dark's or brightening certain colors to make the old movie clear, on a new Blu-ray. Back to the point, the top movies in 3D are operating in full HD 1080p and in some cases slightly higher. What this means to you is that even the clearest newest 3D or 2D Blue-ray movies, on top of the line \"Smart\" 3D Blue-ray players, can not produce over 140hz, however this TV has the same ability when referring to how they make old movies clearer. It takes the 140hz and improves it to near 240hz. The 480hz is simply their so when they improve video quality, you will still be ready you'll be good to 480hz. That's when the technology catches up though. I would also buy this model over the newer one, its near the same price yet Samsung realized they were over doing it and cut cost and the clear motion rate to 240hz MAX. So you'll still be getting the highest that technology has now but when they start making movies that will actually take advantage of the 480hz the new model will not be able to handle it but this modes will.(UN32ES6500F)Sorry about making this so long i just wanted people to know what they were buying.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV is NOT smart!", "Author": "J.

Normally this works great.  In fact, it worked great on the 32\" but not so much on this 46\"er.  I don't believe the wireless is all that great, but it did work fine on smaller AVI files.

They price matched a national brick and mortar retailer who had substantially discounted the 75\" Samsung on a two-day promotional sale. I was quite impressed by the Amazon customer service rep who assisted me in this regard; she was very helpful and prompt with her follow-up. My order was placed 12/25/13, and the item was delivered to my residence on 12/31/13 per Amazon's Free Enhanced Delivery Service--a welcome perk, especially since the large and heavy TV carton had to be carried down one flight of stairs to our basement home theater room.Hooked it up to new home theater components and enjoyed the outstanding HD picture quality that this large screen brings to all video sources--cable, blu-ray, and Netflix. I'm a \"happy camper,\" as is my wife. We had an old Mitsubishi big screen CRT projection TV previously, and the new Samsung just blows it out of the water.  I haven't yet spent much time experimenting with the picture calibration settings; I just selected the default Movie mode and so far that provides optimum viewing results. I do plan to do more calibration experimenting so as to improve the picture even further.The accompanying Samsung remote control is OK, although I would've preferred a universal or learning remote capability that could operate all my components. It's a bit of a pain to have to use multiple remotes to access the various video sources. That's a sore point with my wife.Smart TV network/video steaming connections seem to work OK. And since placing the new Samsung in service, I've easily updated the firmware twice using the internet. As mentioned above, the TV is located in our basement home theater family room, and the router is upstairs in my home office. I have noted some occasional issues with losing the Netflix connection on the Samsung. That could be due to the distance from the router; plus my router is an old (but reliable) Linksys WRT-54G. So I may have to consider updating my router (as well as my cable modem, which only has DOCSIS 2.0 speeds). It should be noted that I previously used a Roku player with my old TV set in the basement, and I rarely encountered Netflix connection issues (but that was with SD video streaming, not HD).Overall, based on the service rendered by Amazon and our overall satisfaction to date with our new Samsung TV, I have no reservation giving a full 5 star rating.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "great picture", "Author": "saundra davies", "ReviewID": "R1UV9STTDDRJDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first smart tv that I have purchased, and at first I found it was smarter than me, but now I have learned how to use the many find features and am amazed what it can do.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "good item..", "Author": "JUN UK", "ReviewID": "R3H11BUT5GHHCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Satisfactory tv screen is too large and clean.Weak part of the sound bar sound purchasingEnjoy great sound quality when connected to tv can be", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Mixed Bag.", "Author": "Andy", "ReviewID": "R1G912LFXOSSFZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this 55 inch F6300 model for two weeks now. I love the picture that the panel can display. Colors are very natural and not too saturated out of the box, and while the brightness is good, it isn't great. I will say though, that I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing it isn't overly bright like my standard LG LCD set I've had for a few years now, because on this Samsung I notice better blacks and shadow detail. Nothing is crushed in terms of color or detail. Viewing angles are okay at best, but stray too far from the center and colors immediately wash out, leaving you to notice backlight seeping through the picture. This set is in my bedroom, so that isn't an issue for me as I'm always front and center with this set. I'm no expert of course, but my eyes have been looking at these screens for years just as much as I've tinkered with them. Maybe I'm wrong on some things--who knows?As for the Smart features, at first when I began the initial setup everything felt like it needed to be broken in, minus the Netflix and Pandora app. YouTube was RIDICULOUSLY slow to load and bring up in general, so I gave up on it. This was all while the television was running on the firmware update version 1118. Though what was odd enough is that a day or two after the update, YouTube and everything else began to run perfectly fine. Perhaps the tv had been doing some background processing at the time I wasn't aware of.Now, for the slight problem I've been experiencing with this tv. While I've come to absolutely love the smart features and everything else it entails, on my set there seems to be something happening with the display I just can't tell if it's normal, or a software glitch that happens on occasion. Randomly during any given time of the day (at least 2 to 6 times a day) the televisions screen will \"SHAKE\" for a second before returning to normal. It's as if the entire picture stutters for a brief moment. It usually happens anywhere between 1 to 3 hours of usage, but your eyes have to be glued to the tv to notice this 'glitch.' I'm aware of the motion flow technology and this problem has occurred in every setting, be it Off, Clear, Standard, Smooth, or Custom. I'm also aware of the halo effect due to the 120hz technology as well as digital artifacts and such, and these have absolutely nothing to do with my problem. Every picture setting on my set is the same in terms of backlight level, brightness, contrast, etc.I've been to multiple retailers asking technicians if they know of the problem, but they all give me the same blank stare as if it's unheard of. I can't even seem to find any information online about this particular problem, so if anyone knows what may be the issue, if it's hardware or software related, I would greatly appreciate the info. Thank You.I've also upgraded the firmware to version 1120 which was released on January 26, but the same issue still remains and the picture shakes at times.[Edit: 2-16-14]After much debate, I simply decided to return the TV where I purchased it from, which was Best Buy. I decided to try it again so I received another new 55 inch F6300 model, though this time I had Best Buy do a price match with a local store called Micro Center. Micro Center had the same TV for $850, so in the end not only did I receive another brand new F6300, but I took over $250 back from what I originally paid. The TV thus far hasn't given me any problems like the other one had, but time will tell if it holds up I suppose.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture quality", "Author": "Paul Riewald", "ReviewID": "R181OM2ZJFE5YD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Smart TV has outstanding picture quality and easy set-up for remote and wireless connection.

It totally delivers on that although it did require a bit of tweaking on the settings out of the box.  Initially, there is an energy saver mode that is switched on and it dramatically reduces the contrast of the picture.  Once that was turned off, the picture was bright and crystal clear.  The difference in quality between this TV and our 3 year old Samsung is night and day so making the purchase was very satisying.I had read several mixed reviews that talked about the sound quality of the set and I've got to concur.  The quality is very mixed.  I fiddled and fiddled for a long time with the settings to try and get it right for TV shows versus sports versus movies and I never felt like I got it completely right.  We did not put the TV on an open wall mount and that might have something to do with the sound quality.  It sits within an entertainment system and I think that degrades the sound.  However, many folks suggested investing in a high quality sound bar and I'm currently researching that as a work around on the sound issues.  Will have to update that later.Long story short, this is a high quality TV and simple to set up right out the box.  All the SmartTV apps have worked flawlessly.  Minus a few demerits for sound quality, I would absolutely recommend this TV as a strong value for the price.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "AWESOME", "Author": "Bree Henderson", "ReviewID": "R2QOWZ6L6DJB14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great price and love the qauilty of the tv.

I havent really used all of the features yet, such as the internet for checking mail, home alarm cameras, etc.  Typical of Samsung, the picture quality is great. The stand that it sits on is handy if you need to swivel the tv, or want to dust around it.  The timer feature is nice, especially because I have a tendency to fall asleep with the tv on.. so I just set it to go off at midnight every night.  Problem solved.  The price point was the deciding factor for this model.  I bought it during a cyber monday sale.  We have two other Samsung models (same size, but different models, and more $$$) and a high-end Sony.  There is a difference of course between this and the Sony, but there is not a district difference between the 3 Samsungs in reference to picture quality, that I (or 3 others) could see.. so.. you will have to determine what is most important for the price you are willing to pay.  If I wasn't getting such a great price for this, I would've been just as happy with the lesser model probably.  Now, for the best tip..  if you are ordering with Amazon Prime, make sure you have delivery arrangements set in stone when purchasing.  There was a huge snag for me personally.  Guess the delivery man was not happy about delivering a big box by himself! He actually ignored it, and left it at the facility for a couple days.  I kept getting notices that I had to pick it up, which was impossible in my case, because I didn't have a vehicle big enough. Another selling point when I made this purchase was free 2 day delivery and NO tax. Cha-ching!  After much ado, I finally got it taken care of, and it was delivered to my door,  but it did not arrive in a timely manner.  An isolated incident?  Perhaps.. but worth mentioning.  And, sadly, it was never determined who exactly messed the delivery up..Amazon or UPS.

Skip down to the 2nd paragraph for gaming if you dont want to real this background paragraph. To start off, I purchased the Samsung UN46F6300 46 inch LED TV solely for the purpose of Video gaming, but also for streaming Netflix and Cable TV. With the new XBOX One coming out I knew I had to upgrade from my Dynex 40 Inch LCD TV I purchased before I went away to school in 2009. I did a lot of research and was split on buying an LED TV that was either 120 HZ refresh rate or 240 HZ. After learning that the human eye can barely tell the difference between 120 HZ and 240 HZ I decided to go with 120 HZ because its cheaper and the technology is better developed than 240 HZ. Long story short, I researched brands endlessly looking for that \"flawless\" TV, and came to the conclusion that my first LED TV is going to be a Samsung. I was then split between the Samsung UN46F6300 (this model) and the Samsung UN46F6400 which is the 3D version with 480 Clear motion rate. After consulting on CNET, my most trusted electronic website, there is no difference between 240 CMR and 480 CMR because they both have an 120 HZ refresh panel.

Even after calibration, re-configuration by samsung via their remote support and tweaking repeatedly using the menu options,  sometimes the picture was washed out with little color.  Other times there was too much black and sometimes the light colors were washed out. Samsung provides picture modes like Dynamic, Standard, Movie, and Natural for some inputs but only Standard and Entertain are available for a PC input.  In essence right out of the box you'll find yourself having to fiddle with picture settings for every input and sometimes wanting to retweak for different content because there is so much inconsistency.The builtin guide mostly doesnt work if you connect a cable Tv RF cable to the Television.  I was hoping the guide would tell me what channels are coming into the television via the cable. After the auto-program feature finds all of the available channels the guide wont tell you what's on.  It expects a set-top-box.  And maybe it wants to duplicate what the set-to-box would tell you.  This seems odd since the software knows there's a cable plugged in, its knows what frequencies were received, it and  knows your zip code.  One would think, this Smart TV would lookup the frequencies over the internet and populate the guide with the names of the channels and shows, just like a normal cable guide.When using the TV as a computer monitor, unlike my old Vizio, it doesnt turn on when the computer comes on.Commonly used buttons like Aspect, Closed Caption, Color Temp (Cool, Warm, etc) dont appear on the remote.  You need to access the menus.If you're using an app like netflix or the weather app and you turn the TV off, the TV will shift to another input when you turn it back on.There is no picture-by-picture so you cant use it, say as a computer and a tv at the same time with side-by-side windows.The USB input and the USB browser windows have a very primitive design - like the earliest version of Window.  Although you can browse photos on a USB drive, you cant control the speed of the slide show and there is only one transition available.I was unable to play any movie format from a USB drive except mp4.  Mkv and avi files wouldnt play.  When trying to play a movie from a DLNA server, the TV would not allow me to fast forward or rewind the movie.The TV has a nice browser for selecting movies to buy / rent.  The screen shows large thumbnails of movie posters or box covers but this format is not available for your own content.  This was a very disappointing discovery.  Quite often in advertisements you'll see a picture of the screen showing movie thumbnails, but you wont be able to get thumbnails for your movies on your drives (think XBMC).Overall after the hype and dazzle wear off  it seems like the apps and TV functions and user interface were all designed by different groups that didnt share a common set of interfaces or approaches to building software so it all seems a bit of a hodge-podge and in need of homogenization.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Good!", "Author": "John Selph", "ReviewID": "R2F0PCKC11XW28", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All is good except for some concern about the sound distribution.

I have had some issues with the netflix app. In particular, I have had to re-enter my password 3 times since purchasing this TV. With the included remote entering text is really annoying. The issue has been annoying, but it is not a deal breaker. The TV's web browser is really slow and does not work well with all websites. For example, I could not make a video from cbs full screen (on the bright side, the advertisements in the video did not work either). The slow browser speed could be my wireless internet, but I can stream fine with my computer.I am very cheap, so I am not willing to pay for Huluplus. Of course, the TV cannot access Hulu. So, I just bought a 15' HDMI cable that I run from my TV to my computer. That works great and saves me the cost of Huluplus.To finish everything off, I bought a $10 indoor antenna (check TVfool.com to figure out what channels to expect) so that I can watch sports.As to the video, I am not sure I like the clear motion since it makes all of the video have this sort of \"soap opera\" effect to the video.

I purchased a Samsung UN40F6030 from ABT. for my bedroom. Within 2 days when I turned it on the screen would be pink and no sound. To correct the problem I simply would turn the TV off/on using the comcast remote and the picture and sound would be fine. This all happened within the 30 day return period. I kept ABT informed of what was happening. I changed my cable box twice and HDMI cables once. On day 31 it did it again, I called ABT and they said send it back at their expense. When I talked to my sales person I asked if I could upgrade because of the price drop on the UN40F6300 and he said no problem, so I did. I get the 6300 and within 1 day I had the same problem. Only this time turning the TV on and off did not correct it, I would have to disconnect the Hdmi cables from the TV or cable box, plug them back in and I had a perfect picture. I went down to Comcast and picked up my third  brand new cable box and another set of Hdmi cables, same problem. Comcast said I have a good signal and they are not having any issues with this new box on Samsung Tv's they are having an issue with Vizio Tv's using this box.  This Comcast box has only been out about 2 months it is a hi-def box only, it does not have on demand, the guide or any premium channels. This particular box is on all the time, it does not turn on/off with the remote like my other HD boxes. The box is about 1\" by 5\". This Tv is hooked up to nothing else. Comcast is now sending me a new box that is built by Motorola the other 3 were built by Pace. I really like the Tv, the picture is fantastic and I can't believe that 2 Tv's and 2 different models would have the exact same problem. ABT has been a great company to deal with, they said I can send it back. But I don't think the problem is with the Tv. Comcast believe it or not, is also really trying to help. I also called Samsung they said I had bad Hdmi cables, when I said I am on my  third set they said my hdmi ports on the Tv are bad. I said maybe one port but not all four. Now they want to send a tech. Can any one help or have any suggestions.

The F series sets seem more accurate and easier to get dialed in than previous years. I use the standard mode mostly for general stuff, sports, and it's rich, saturated but accurate color, was very easy to get calibrated.  I calibrated the movie mode using Consumer reports settings, and it looks great also, just a bit softer, but better for movies. Just a matter of personal choice between the 2. I wouldn't screw around with other people's settings, everybody has their own opinions, and I find most settings are too dull and flat. Consumer reports tests them all, and they give this picture their highest rating.  The screen is more like a semi gloss, still gets reflections, but not quite as bad high gloss screens.It's not all perfect though as the wireless is slow. I only get 4mb/s speed and it's only a couple feet from the router. My laptop in the same room gets 16mb/s. Maybe a direct connection would be faster.  Also the controls freeze and it reboots itself every day around 4pm. Not sure why that happens but maybe a software update in the future will fix it. Also the sound is a bit hollow sounding, not really the best, it's ok for general TV. There's a 3.5mm audio out that works great for headphones or powered speakers, but unfortunately there's no volume control. No idea why they would put an audio jack like that with no volume control, but it's usable with headphones, just a constant moderate volume. The infrared receiver is a nice touch if you want 1 remote to control the set top box, but the buttons are kind of spread out all over the remote, so not the easiest to use.

I have the TU02 panel. In general the picture is OK to good (not spectacular but fairly decent for the price). However, there are a  couple of issues with my set (that have been mentioned by some other customers as well here and/or on other forums).1. All four corners (about 1-2 square inches in each corner) in certain light scenes are visibly darker (and image occasionally gets a little cloudy in these areas). This is not always the case - but it really distracts me from enjoying nice scenery such as blue skies across the screen, snow scenes, etc). One of the best ways I found to test for this issue is to download the BBC News app in the smart hub and run it (in between pieces of news it has a white background on the edges). I understand that edge-lit sets are more prone to color uniformity issues compared to other sets. However, going to the store and looking at other TV sets, I did not spot this issue in many other panels for other brands (talking about Samsung being a top brand). Also moving to 7100 series on Samsung this problem seems to be address to a great extent. Interestingly, this problem is less visible on larger panels since the corners take up a smaller percentage of the screen surface. Don't get me wrong - other panels have other issues such as viewing angle color deterioration, clouding throughout the screen, problems in rendering fast action, etc. Not making here an overall comparison - I am strictly reflecting on this issue of darker corners.2. I could spot a little banding issue on the right side of the screen. Over uniform light backgrounds there is a barely visible vertical line (as other customers put it, like a barely visible scorch mark). Not visible in scenes that involve some complexity of color patterns or darker nuances.3. When there are apps updates in the Smart Hub, all my installed apps get uninstalled. Then I have to manually reinstall them. This happened already twice.I still have until Jan 15 (extended returns during holiday season) to return the set and I am deeply contemplating returning this item. There is the low end where people are willing to accept poorer quality in exchange for affordability. There is the high end where quality commends a premium. Then there is the middle range ... I believe this set is in the latter.  It seems also that there is a panel lottery (many users are ecstatic about the set) though TU02 seemed to be the better panels.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Its Ok", "Author": "Grant Smith", "ReviewID": "R2FE210VT2I1QW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Picture looks good.Usually takes 2 attempts for it to pullup Netflix, The universal remote setup doesn't work, It won't recognize my Verizon settop box.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "internet access/navigation", "Author": "photosius", "ReviewID": "R3QZHY11CN0KVY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "internet access doesn't work very well...unable to watch videos on sites other the the ones already set up on the system", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Screen for the money", "Author": "Mary Arendse", "ReviewID": "R279WK06WARL4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picture Clarity and color with depth is extremely good for this price range, the least fond is the speakers are in the rear of the TV thus our Boise was a handy addition", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN46F6300 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz Slim Smart LED HDTV", "Author": "Biyu Zhu \"Biyu\"", "ReviewID": "R34BETIAVV810L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "s Samsung UN46F6300 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz Slim Smart LED HDTV: great buy, good value, high tech with the features you wanted.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Un55f6300", "Author": "Michael Dies", "ReviewID": "R3PLFZ4LGY029M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok but not great.

The TV will not stay connected to the internet (wireless), not just during streaming movies, but even navigating the menu screen. Example I wirelessly connect to the internet and the TV confirms it is connected, but as soon as I navigate to download apps, it will say I am not connected and ask for the password again.  I have downloaded the latest firmware and I have a new b/g/n dual-band wireless modem that's in the same room with the TV.2) AUDIO OUT.  All that is available is a non-standard 2.5mm audio-out jack (no RCA jack), unless you have an optical port on your receiver.  The brief manual made no mention of the jack size.3) TV SPEAKERS: They lack fidelity. I was watching a movie that I have seen many times and some of the tonal sounds were inaudible, I used the menu system to adjust the audio in every possible preset and not much changed.  Voices are ok.4) APPS: Nothing was preloaded.  Maybe they would have automatically if my internet was working properly, but the procedure and documentation were not apparant.  I may be missing something here, but I shouldn't have to scratch my head for an hour and still get nowwhere.5) CONNECTIONS: Minimal. Lack of analog support such as the previously mentioned 'audio-out' for connection to the stereo. No RGB port for PC connection except for HDMI. But if you have an older laptop you're without HDMI out you're stuck.  No separate Composite Video IN.  Only Composite/Component IN.Because of the wireless connection issue, the TV will have to be returned.  With all the space and surface area for a decent wireless antenna to be embedded in the TV, there is no excuse for dropouts and/or connection issues.  A firmware update in March was suppose to fix this but it did not for me.Why give an otherwise good picture, name-brand TV 2-stars? Because it's sold as a smart TV; and to be smart you need a connection with the internet.

Should the set give me trouble I can return it locally versus having to eat the shipping sending it back to the Amazon vendor.  I also get a double manufacturer's warranty along with the usual 2% rebate when charged to the AMEX credit card. Now for the review and observations......Unlike the Samsung 32inch Smart TV this 46 inch model has a slightly different user interface and a larger remote.  I had a opportunity to get something a bit less expensive but I wanted all the latest .... built-in Wi-Fi, 120Hz, 1080p, and LED backlit (more on this in a bit).  This set retired my old 19-inch analog TV with it's analog to digital converter with rabbit ear antenna.  For me, it was like going from the 18th century to the 21st century.  I can now stream youtube videos using my Google Nexus 10 tablet having paired the Nexus 10 to the Samsung.  I also have downloaded a Samsung app which allows me to use the Nexus 10 tablet as a secondary remote control.  I am using a cheap Mohu antenna and do not have to connect to my external house antenna.  The Mohu antenna picks up all the local channels FREE ...I get channels 2,4,5,7,9,11,13 which is all I want.The picture quality on this TV is beyond describing and the CBS football games are breathtaking.  I have other Samsung flat panels at home and the brand is top notch except for capacitors blowing out every few years.  For me this is NOT a issue since a few 1000uF 16V high temp radial electrolytic  capacitors get them back up and running.  Samsung is notorious for spec'ing and using cheap caps just to keep their bean counters happy.  The power supply board on this new TV is part number BN44-00611A and is readily available on eBay for $30 which for me sealed the deal also.  Right now I have a second remote being delivered this week since we all know the weakest link on all TV's are the hand held remotes.  Snagged my 2nd remote for $20 with free shipping...cannot beat that!  The main logic pcb is part number BN94-06167C also readily available via Ebay and the extra remote controls are part number AA59-00784A.  Just don't pay more than $20 for the remotes otherwise you are getting ripped off.Some of the reviewers voiced displeasure with the sound coming out of the TV but me, I have no issues with the sound having come from a 20 year old analog TV with a A/D converter...ugh!  Right now I am shopping around for a 32-inch set for the BR but still want a minimum of 120Hz and 1080p...something which I have seen is very elusive on small sets.  No hurry on this since I have time to shop and compare prices.  Other reviews have issues hooking up a keyboard but not me...a surplus $10 usb keyboard from Ebay was instantly recognized by the Samsung TV which is way better than using the Samsung remote control...another ugh!  Only negative thing I can say is the remote has a very anemic light when you are pressing buttons in the dark with this remote but I can live with it on a otherwise stellar smart TV.  This set should last me for years since I expect to be repairing the set myself .... only time it becomes unrepairable is when the actual flat panel display gets toasted.

TV and Sound bar are not smart enough work together as plug'n'play devices.- Once you find out that you need to treat the Samsung Sound Bar as an alien device and configure your TV's remote to control it, well, that doesn't work. All attempts to make the TV remote work on the frequency of the Sound Bar's controller fail. Even resetting the hardware to factory defaults does not help.- Pushing the Netflix button on the (Smart!) TV remote brings up the Netflix app, but often it fails to connect. The solution? DELETE your netflix account info and set it up again. Yes, type your email and password repeatedly.- Oh, you would like to hook up a Keyboard because the (Smart!) TV's netflix app is a piece of garbage and needs to be reset every couple of days? How about a nice Bluetooth keyboard! No, this TV doesn't speak it.- OK how about his nice USB keyboard sitting in a box. NOPE, only the arrow keys work.- Maybe THIS keyboard? No, sorry.

And if you want to change something while watching a show you wind up missing things because it is so cumbersome.I use the TV as a monitor to my computer and when I change back and forth from one to the other it, again, requires many remote key steps. How about just one?Let\u2019s talk about the remote, what a piece of junk! It is poorly designed. You can\u2019t tell by just picking it up if you have it in the right direction, you have to look at it and be awake too. It is difficult to pick up, say from a table with the keys facing down, then you have to look at it before you can use it to make sure the direction is correct, and lord forbid if you get it wrong and you press the wrong button. It transports you to some wonderland and takes you hours to recover from with an act of congress to get changed, and we know congress gets nothing done these days. So you screwed. Really! I should not have to go and buy a separate remote that\u2019s even somewhat intelligently designed, and user friendly. If you want I\u2019ll come by your plant and show you how to do it.

I even chatted with the sales guy at Samsung about this and there were not offers of caveats about its use.The noise, HUMM, coming from the back is enormous when this thing is just turned on. If you like quiet, again this is not for you. You cannot control the volume of an extension speaker from this TV set. You have to have another remote for that. In other words, with all the buttons you have to deal with you have to have another remote to control other pieces of equipment that are connected to this TV.

The picture quality and panel uniformity is great for its price, but I cannot stand how difficult it is to enable game mode.

You have to push buttons about 10 or 12 times to enable game mode.  And when game mode is enabled the picture looks washed out and loses color/contrast accuracy.And when game mode is enabled, the settings (brightness, backlight, contrast, etc) is based on movie mode.  For a lot of people, they use movie mode with warm temperature, low brightness, and low color, and use game mode with medium temperature, mid or high brightness, and slightly higher color.  So every time you enable game mode you have to change these settings as well.I could watch videos with Natural or Vivid presets, the problem is that auto dimming is forced on these presets.  Auto dimming kicks in when the picture is mostly dark.  It dramatically lowers brightness and backlight.

I know the warranty is only 1 year but should I just swallow the fact that the TV I paid a couple of thousand dollars for lasted only 4 years? And repair costs as much as buying a new one?
