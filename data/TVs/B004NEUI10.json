I thought it would be too small for my 34 yr old daughter room. It turned out to be the perfect size. The picture is cyrstal clear, sharp and good looking. It was very easy for her to set it up, delete stations she doesn't watch. Her brother attached her DVD player and she and my only eight yr old grandaughter are thrilled with their \"just because gift\". Being a single mother, she always got the hand me down electronics. This is her first brand new TV. Thank you", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "Paul S.", "ReviewID": "R32JDH5S9I6HPW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Installed in a 32' foot Class A motor home.

Then when it arrived I re-discovered what a bad idea it is to buy a TV without first seeing it.  Perhaps my concerns won't be relevant to other potential buyers, but here goes anyway:1. The audio out jacks on the back of the TV don't work when using an HDMI source.  I wanted to hook the tv up to a pair of amplified speakers. It took 20 minutes on the phone with Orion (Sansui) tech support to discover the problem.  The documentation is at best misleading.2. The viewing angle is horrific, both left-right and up-down.  Blacks go from dark to gray with a few degrees of motion, whites get washed out.  There seemed to be no setting that yielded good viewing from more than one orientation.3. Even at the \"optimal\" viewing location, there was something distinctly wrong with the contrast no matter what I did to the settings.  Light scenes lose detail in a general white haze, darker scenes look muddy and shadow detail is gone.If none of the above matter to you, maybe this (cheap in every aspect) set is for you.
