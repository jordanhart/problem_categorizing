I do not have a high definition feed, so am watching standard definition TV on it, and am pleased. There were no problems with shipping, or setting up the TV, and everything is just as advertised. No problems with the remote or the menus. All in all, a good TV for the price.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV for small rooms", "Author": "Parth G. Patel", "ReviewID": "R2JKWLWXQFBR0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is great for a bedroom or a dorm [reason why I bought it]. The picture is great and the sound just right. This TV is after all only 22 inches so one shouldn't expect the sound to fill a huge room. LG is also a good TV manufacturer and a trusted brand. My roommate last year had an LG TV as well, and it worked great and is still working like the day we opened the box. This is probably the cheapest 22 inch flat screen you'll find, and its a steal at the price. Sure its not a top notch as some of the more expensive brands, but the difference is hardly noticeable. With the price, quality, and reliability considered, I would give this TV a 5 out of 5.There is one thing though, one of the pictures on amazon isn't correct. I think its of an older model.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poor SD display, better with HD sources.", "Author": "G. Hodgdon II", "ReviewID": "R3POT6UY97V1V0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The display on this TV was below my expectations. I first thought the washed out display was due to the composite cable being used to connect a DVD player. Switching to component (480p) did not help much. On top of that, the back light is too bright to begin with and when adjusted the picture can become muddy. There is an auto adjust feature that reduces the back light in steps to match a dark or bright screen. The problem with it here is the steps are noticeable, not smooth. I was surprised to see that this is not a 16:9 display, it is 16:10 which is commonly found on PC monitors. The default aspect ratio is set to \"full\" which stretches everything to fill the screen. There is an option to set 16:9 or even better have it set automatically based on the input signal. This works well with OTA digital TV as it will not letter and pillar box the 4:3 signal. Because of the aspect ratio of the tv, HD content that would normally be full frame is now letter boxed. Not to big of a problem to me. I tested this with a Blu-Ray copy of Kill Bill, the picture quality (player set to 1080p) was better than component. Used the same player set to 720p and the quality was about the same. If using a standard DVD player, I'd suggest it be one that up converts to HD via HDMI. Also, the transition from the letterbox caused by the 16:10 monitor to the black bars inherent with the movie was pretty seamless until the back light started to adjust. This would have been a much better TV if the black levels were better and had an over all better display quality. I was going to give this 2 stars but after trying the different HD sources it earns a 3.", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "DOA", "Author": "A.

Kept thinking it was me doing something wrong.  Ended up just hitting WalMart for a Samsung LN26B460 26-Inch 720p LCD HDTV that was actually about the same price.  That is a wonderful TV.On a non-related note, Amazon did NOT refund my money right away.  I had to go rounds with their Customer Service folks before they finally gave me the credit.  Out $300 for over a month due to this.

The picture is awesome, the size is perfect for my room (I have it set up about 2 feet from my bed although i can imagine being able to watch it from across my room too; my room being about 200 square feet)Of course I can't speak to specific features but I don't think I could tell between a 720 and 1060; the picture is extremely clear. And it doesn't take forever to switch between channels. I've read before that the sound leaves something to be desired but honestly, I am very satisfied with it.The only thing it doesn't have for this size is a swivel stand which gets kind of annoying sometimes since I always want it either pointed at my bed or my room when i'm doing something.Otherwise great purchase and totally worth it in my opinion.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3SJGZUJCE56FP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased for my son's dorm room, works great and picture was sharp for the price point.", "Date": "September 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Audra Rys", "ReviewID": "R3M09O6O0269AW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to have in my bedroom.
