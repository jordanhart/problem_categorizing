I looked at plasmas, 120Hz LCDs, 40\", 42\", Sharp, Sony, Panasonic, Samsung, Vizio, Westinghouse, and LG.I finally found it - on sale for almost two-hundred off (exactly eight-hundred-and-nine dollars). Would still be a great value at a thousand dollars.I'd rather have too much control than too little with my electronics. The 42LH30 delivers all the control I want and more, but it also provides several nice presets for the type of content I'm watching (movies, sports, games, standard). It also lets me build 2 presets myself for exactly what I want. I can be picky or I can be lazy and still get a great picture for any situation.The 50,000 dynamic contract ratio and 5ms refresh speed make for a superb picture/performance combo.I was very close to going with a 120Hz 42\" Vizio. They have been getting decent reviews. When the LG 42lh30 went on sale, it was a deal I could not refuse.Some things I really like.1) Outstanding picture (no compromises with colors)2) Great performance (sports and movies don't judder at all so far)3) Energy Star (several low power modes - I love flexibility)4) Lighter than most (easy to hang on wall - I use an articulating arm)5) Anti-glare awesomeness (I have lots of windows in my 3-seasons room)6) Outstanding PC screen (when I just have to surf on the 42\")7) Upconverting DVDs look phenomenal (blu-ray player is next purchase)8) Sound is more than acceptable on TV (I usually output audio to my Home Theater system if I will be watching for more than a few minutes)Things I would change:1) Only 3 HDMI ports (Fine for me now with cable box, DVD player, and PC)2) I'd prefer a matte black bezel instead of a gloss finish3) Maybe add an SD-card reader (my DVD player has SD and USB reader, fortunately)", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lip Sync problem fixed", "Author": "Gweff", "ReviewID": "R12NJGB2TB9AC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall a great TV.  I had bought a samsung, but it was too thick for my taste.  I did notice the \"lip sync\" problem when using the TV's speakers to watch TV.  This is a problem with how the TV gets the digital input from the Dish DVR that I am using.  The fix is to hold the MENU button on TV (on Left side of TV) at the same pushing the MENU button on the the remote control.  Then enter \"0000\" for the code.  This will access the system menu.  Go down to \"Lip Sync\" and adjust the number up or down till the lip movements matches the sound coming out of the speakers.", "Date": "September 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent HDTV", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R1U52MXYVTQ5WS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for about four months now and I am very happy with my purchase.I actually ordered the LG 42LG50 (through Amazon from TigerDirect) but they must have run out of them because they sent me the better LG 42LH30.Excellent color, great response (for a 60Hz), SD signals (VCR) look surprisingly good, the menus are intuitive, the remote is laid out very well, and it has a great overall look.The only down side that I wasn't expecting is that it has no analog audio out (no RCA L/R out) so you'll have to have a digital receiver if you want run the sound through external speakers.", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV Compared to the Competition. . . .", "Author": "C.

Compared to the competition LG seems to more than hold it's own, plus the price point is excellent. Other reviews share the good points so I won't go into them only to mention that I found this to be the best 'bang for the buck' in 1080 LCD 42\" TV. While LG is not yet considered a major brand in America, I purchased many LG products when I lived in Thailand in 2005.I found them to be excellent products then and still do now. Overseas LG sells all sorts of products. One could almost say it's the GE of Asia - except LG TV's are superior to any GE product - by a huge margin.I also have a 50\" Panasonic Plasma that I purchased a couple years ago when that model was rated #1 by Consumer Reports.

I asked my husband 6 months ago for my own lcd tv right after I got my xbox 360. I spent the weekend in awe. We have a 46 Sony Bravia (changed the inches since someone felt the need to correct it, LOL) in the family room and in my opinion it doesn't compare to my 42 LG. The features are user friendly and the HDMI cable just enhanced every feature about it. My movies were crisp and clear. I would recommend this tv above all else and the price was excellent. I wanted the 120hz because I thought I would have to worry about ghosting while gaming but this tv did not disappoint and I saved a couple hundred bucks. I searched and researched and searched again for a tv and I am happy with my choice. Extremely happy. I just need to wait patiently for Ghost Recon:The Future Soldier to come out and it would make it complete. For now, I'll just sit back and keep playing COD:MW2.

As soon as I turn it on, I noticed a cloudy area in the screen, about 3/4 length and 1/4 area of the screen. This was easiest to see just as the Tv was turned on for that second or two before it finds the channel. When I had something on with bright colors, I really didn't notice any difference, but when the colors were dark, or when I turned on a black and white movie the cloud was quite visible. I called LG directly who informed me that their were no LG technicians available and worse, didn't know when one would be avaiable. The advice was just to return the set to the store. I suppose this is the best advice because I had just gotten it and there were problems already, but I was surprised that LG wouldn't want to keep a TV that was already in my home from being returned to the store and ultimately (I suppose) to them. I was willing for a techinician to take a look at it because I liked the picture quality at those times when the cloud was not noticeable.

Hook it up to the blu ray dvd with the hdmi cable, and turn the tv on, the blu ray goes on, or vice versa.  Tv also recognize the input when it's on and it will go to that input for the most part.Awesome picture, the color is amazing and bright.  Audio is great too.  I've had this for a few weeks and I have no complaints. I love the design on this as well.  I'd recommend this to anyone.  Even though, I got a great deal, I'd get this again if it was at regular price.  When compared to other brands for this size and the 1080p, this came out the winner.I'll have to say with comparing blu ray dvd and regular dvd, the detail is a bit more, along with audio, but playing a regular dvd is just as great.More than enough inputs, so that's another plus.  My only disappointment is that this does not offer a S video input, however it does have the old fashioned monitor 15 pn input.  However, getting a blu-ray dvd player that plays divx was a good solution, so I'm happy either way.I highly recommend this tv ;o)Also, if you will be using a wall mount, i went with a tilt wall mount, I was happy to see that there is still room for me to move it so that I can reach the inputs if i need to add cables to it.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Couldn't have asked for more", "Author": "Patrick Healy", "ReviewID": "R28LTD36GWO9O9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV was a great price at the time of purchase and delivers a beautiful picture.

It does have a feature to automatically turn on and off, so I guess that is what the clock is all about, but auto on and off is not important to me.  I bought the LG because of the name.

This automatically took Samsung out of the running... they have low customer support and the rate at which their LCDs fail is fairly high within the first year.  Also Sony and Toshiba because of Customer support and price.So this left Panasonic and LG as the top brands (excluding others due to various other reasons).Panasonic was all sold out of there 2009 models so the logical choice was LG... But how did they compare on quality..SoundSuperb, compared to almost all other brands(that i have heard), and much better than Samsung.  Sound is crisp and clear (with the volume all the way up only the slightest amount of static is heard) ... Very low volume is also no problem either..sound still comes across clear. The speakers are hidden, and provides ample bass.PictureSD(standard definition) is scaled well.. SD is what you expect it to be .. not perfect.. but still viewable, which is a plus.. I have seen many LCD TV's in the last few months that look horrible through SD TV or component consoles.HD(High Definition) is nothing short of amazing... there is not much more to say on this subject other then it keeps up with anything else in this price/size range.Black levels are dark but do not over power any of the darker scenesWhites are bright and pureColors are crisp and accurateThis LCD TV stands up to the best of pictures in this price range.SetupSet the TV on a small entertainment center that is smaller then the TV itself, the small stand that comes with the TV even without screwing it in is PLENTY sturdy to hold the TV up by itself..The only revision to this would be if you have kids that are a bit rough and they knocked into it pretty hard it could tip... but it would have to be fairly hard..It was extremely easy to setup, which only took about 5 minutes on basic cable.. with more channels comes a longer setup time .. but that is to be expected ..Overall **FOR THE PRICE** this is the best possible deal I have found for an LCD TV in the 40in range.DeliveryWe received this TV before the estimated delivery date by DAYS!In perfect condition and ready to go.

I did have some issue with the HDMI connection being not tight enough, but I am blaming that on the cable (see below, you can read my review on that page).The one other issue I have with this tv is the strange little \"bump out\" it has on the bottom edge of the tv on the right hand side.  If you click on the picture to zoom in, you can barley see it, but its there.  It looks like a little chrome bubble.  In person, it really stand out to me.  When we first took it out of the box, I thought the chrome edging along the bottom of the tv had been damaged and was pulled away in that one spot.  It turns out that when you plug it in a colored light shines into this bubble and shows you it has powered.  And the light changes color when you turn the tv on.I have to admit it probably would not look as bad if the tv were on a stand.
