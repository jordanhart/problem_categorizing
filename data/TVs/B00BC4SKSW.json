{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Panasonic VT60 65\" Plasma - Nothing is perfect, but so far VERY pleased!", "Author": "Timothy J. Sexton \"tjs\"", "ReviewID": "R1UWTG93YVKYAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Caution:  What follows is a long-winded review, read before bed time if you are having trouble falling asleep! ;-)  Happy reading.For those looking for a \"Readers Digest\" version of the review  - overall I am extremely satisfied with the VT60 picture quality and features.  IMHO, it lives up to all the hype, and the Value Electronics shootout experts picking it as the \"top dog\" in Plasmas is warranted - it beats out any other plasma I have owned or seen - and it is a lot bigger at 65\" to boot!  The only other plasmas, or any TV for that matter, that are on the same level as the VT60 are the Panasonic ZT60 and Samsung F8500, and if these sets are better than the VT60 it is not by much.  Now, on to the details...First - I am *not* a true \"videophile\" but I do have a long history with plasmas, and purchased my first two plasma TV's way back in 2003.  They were both Sony's (a 42\" and a 32\") and they were both built like tanks. I still own both today and use them daily, with the 42\" in my family room and the 32\" in my shop.  They both also still display a wonderful picture 10 years later, and they were one of the best TV purchases I have ever made!  I also currently own a Sony 46\" Bravia LCD I purchased about five years ago (our bedroom TV) - another wonderful TV. I also own a couple of smaller TV'sI have owned the VT60 for 2 weeks now as of the date of this review.  I spent about 8 weeks debating, comparing  the 65\" VT60, ZT60 and the Samsung F8500 64\", with many trips to electronics stores where I could commandeer the remotes ;-) and spend time with different video sources comparing the sets. (nothing worse than comparing the TV's in the Standard and Vivid modes the retailers use on the floor).  Note I also recently purchased a 65\" Samsung 7000 LED from Costco about 12 weeks ago, but that set was returned as I was not at all satisfied (to put it lightly) with the picture quality, the contrast, and overall viewing experience.  I always seemed to be \"messing\" with the picture settings on the LED when changing viewing content, I could never get it right as what worked well for one channel / show did not hold true for others... I have read how others have the same issue.There are still times that I wish I would have purchased the ZT60 for ~$500 more, as there is a little glare on the VT60 compared to the ZT60 when viewing during the day.  Those looking at the VT60, you may have read that there is a little glare in brighter environs, and it is true.  Whether it is beyond your tolerance is personal preference; my viewing room is not overly bright and it is within the tolerance level for me, though sometimes I still notice it.  If you have an overly bright viewing room, take a more critical look at the Samsung F8500 plasma or the Panasonic ZT60 plasma as they are better for brighter viewing locations.What did I think of the VT / ZT compared to the new Samsung F8500 plasma?  Bottom line - for my eye (and YMMV of course) the Panasonic was just more pleasing to the eye on displaying the \"blacks\", and appeared to have better contrast and color transitions than the Samsung series.  I know the Value Electronics shootout \"audience\" chose the F8500 as the overall top pick, whereas the \"experts\" picked the VT60 as the top dog which illustrates that BOTH are great displays, and that it is a tough choice for anyone comparing the two.  Note that in all cases in the VE shootout, the Panasonics won on contrast, black levels, motion viewing - it was the brightness feature that put the Samsung F8500 over the top as it was markedly better.  For me, I think the contrast / black level rating should have been weighted more heavily in the final tally, but that is just me - if it were then the Panasonic would have won hands down, even in the \"audience\" vote as the results were virtually a tie as it stood.Now on to more detailed observaations on the VT60:Packaging:The VT60 is packaged VERY well. The box is huge, and there are thick Styrofoam inserts inside the box holding the TV, and a lot of space between the TV and the side of the box.  As a result, the box weighs around 140lbs with the TV inside.  Panasonic did a good job of giving this box adequate protection! (not all TV's do). By comparison, the 65\" Samsung LED set I returned to Costco - the VT60 box dwarfed the Samsung LED box, and the Panasonic had higher quality packaging materials and heavier cardboard IMHO.Construction of the VT60:The older plasmas are thicker and heavier, but these days they have thinned them down and made them more streamlined.  In addition, the back panel of the VT60 is not plastic like many of the TV's sold today - it is metal and very substantial.  I appreciated this, the 65\" Samsung 7000 LED was plastic and I seem to recall the F8500 was also.  Although the plastic construction lightens up the weight a bit on other models, I prefer the metal / solid construction of the VT60 plasma.... I guess I am just old fashioned and appreciate things built more solidly.  Also, the stand is heavy, solid and substantial.  The stand does NOT swivel, but this was not important to me due to the configuration of the room where it is set up.  It is made of high quality stainless and holds the TV well.  Mounting the TV into the stand requires two people for the 65\" and probably the same for the 60\".  You could probably do it alone in a pinch, but having two people reduces the stress level when attempting to insert it into the stand!The VT60 \"look and feel\" is not flashy / sexy IMO, it is simple, unassuming and pedestrian.  The silver bezel around the edge is a nice touch, and overall I prefer the toned down look and its simplicity.Installation / Setup:As with most TVs these days, and due to the HDMI cables of today, the setup / cabling is a breeze.  I run all of my optical / sound cables directly from the device to the AVR, and have one Optical Out coming from the TV for watching Over-the-air signals, and for the Smart TV menus / streaming.  My AVR does not have HDMI inputs, as it is an ancient Denon 2800 (I need to upgrade ;-)) so I have to route all of my devices HDMI directly to the TV!  Thus, I wish the VT60 had more than 3 HDMI ports as I am one with too many devices - don't most of us - but for many of those that do not have \"too many\" devices it won't be an issue.  Five would have been better, but I make do.The setup of the TV on initial start up was easy - although I did not have my wireless keyboard at that point and entering in the data for things like the WEP wireless key (25 characters) was a pain with the included remotes.  (See the remote critique below - I am not a big fan so far of the included remotes - I already purchased a wireless keyboard, and plan on upgrading my universal remote).Picture Quality:In the 2 weeks of owning the VT60, I have viewed a good degree of varying content to make an assessment of picture quality.  I have watched three 3d movies - Avatar, Avengers and Toy Story ; viewed various sporting events including around ten (or so) baseball games on ESPN, WGN and more, watched the Stanley Cup Game 7 recorded from DVR, watched Game 7 of the NBA finals recorded on the DVR, soccer, etc.  I have watched Bluray movies of different titles, older 480p titles like Rocky, Groundhog Day and more.  I have watched Discovery, Science channel for many hours, shows like Deadliest Catch, Storage Wars, Pawn Stars, Through the Wormhole, cartoons (with my boys), cooking and home improvement shows, and more. We are a TV watching type of family, and we view many types of shows to put the TV through its paces  We have nearly achieved the 100 hours of \"break in time\" called for with the VT60 - we are enjoying it, plus the boys are on summer break and the TV is on at least 6-7 hours a day whether watching movies, playing the PS3, etc.  The novelty has not worn off yet I guess!  Here is what I have found:- Picture Settings - as recommended in many forums, I have been using the THX Cinema picture setting and think it produces the best overall picture for all content I view.  During the \"break in\" period I am leaving the contrast, color and brightness at the default settings, or very close to it.  I am not running any break in \"slides\" and do not plan on having the TV professionally calibrated - I am just planning on *maybe* running the THX optimizer at a minimum at a later date.  YMMV.- Brightness - the biggest \"knock\" on the VT60 by the critics is regarding the brightness of the VT60 - it is not \"knock your socks off bright\" - but from my experience, that is like most plasmas.  That is the big selling point on Samsung's F8500, it is a bright plasma.  However, most plasma's today have had the same characteristic, and for my taste this is not an issue - compared to the overly bright LED displays, I appreciate the muted, more realistic look of the plasma, even if they are a tad dimmer.  Others may find it not to their liking, especially if it is your first plasma, but it depends on the person.  To me, again, the brightness is fine.  The best combination of brightness / contrast is found using the \"THX Cinema\" or \"THX Bright Room\" settings - other settings like \"Standard\" don't give as much brightness.  As mentioned above, I would recommend leaving the TV set at THX cinema setting as that is touted as giving the best overall picture for all content.- Contrast - As advertised, VT60's contrast is top of the heap.  The color transition and sharp edges are incredible.  Bright colors next to more muted colors are well discerned, and it has no trouble delineating / separating deep reds right next to dull grays.  The Value Electronics plasma shoot out rated the VT and ZT series TV's as the best contrast in the industry, and you have to see it for yourself to believe it.  It is better than any TV I have ever owned, and probably as good as any TV I have ever viewed.- Black Levels - This is where the VT and ZT series shine.  The black levels are astounding.  The 65\" Samsung LED I returned absolutely failed on the black levels, and by comparison the VT60 is light years ahead.  One unforgiving test of the black rendering is on the Discovery Science channel; the show \"Through the Wormhole\" with Morgan Freeman, it often shows him in a dimly lit room with different shades of black shadows where he is wearing a black suit.  That scene is a test for a TV's ability to render the black levels, and the 65\" Samsung LED butchered this scene, with \"pixelated\" / washed-out blacks and all sorts of choppiness.  It was awful.  But the VT60 has no issue rendering this scene - you can pick up the different shades of black in the shadows, and they contrast with the black suit he is wearing very well.  The VT60 also does a much better job on this than the two other plasmas I own - it is very evident.  The hype about the black level rendering of the VT60 is living up to expectations so far...- 3D Quality - granted, it is not IMAX, but if you choose titles filmed in native 3d (like Avatar) my guess is you will be quite pleased with the 3D experience.  Avatar was awesome in 3D... period.  Note that not all movies being sold as 3D movies were shot \"natively\" in 3D - many like Jurassic Park, Transformers and many more were shot in 2D and then re-produced to add 3D effects.  Not the same thing, and some are not happy with those titles.  Do a Google search on this topic (real vs. fake 3d movies) and you will find a lot of information.  Overall, I am very happy with the 3D capabilities of the set - again, 3D was not the major deciding factor on the VT60, it is more of a bonus to me as picture quality trumps all... the fact the 3D works well and maintains an awesome picture whilst doing so is very nice!The bottom line - I bought the VT60 for its touted Picture Quality - that was the MAIN factor in my decision. And it has not disappointed - what an awesome picture!  Things like Smart TV features, camera, etc were secondary in my decision.The Remotes / Peripherals, 3D glasses and Camera:The Panasonic comes with two remotes - one remote that is more for using for all the TV functionality, and one smaller remote that has a track pad that can be used for the smart TV interface, etc.  I am not overly excited about the remotes - one might want to consider getting a high quality universal remote paired with a wireless keyboard instead.  The larger remote does not have the ability to control your other peripherals like other TV remotes do, and the smaller remote I found to be not so great IMHO.  During setup, when tying in your information and especially the 25 character WEP keys, a wireless keyboard is better served.  I bought a Logitech wireless KB to use with the VT60, and happier with that for navigating the smart TV features.  The camera is OK, and the facial recognition is working, but I am realizing the camera is something I probably won't use much at this point.The included 3D glasses (two pairs) are of good quality, and work well.  If you have to buy more Panasonic 3D glasses, be aware they are expensive - I would recommend alternatively purchasing the Samsung 3D glasses instead for $20 if you need more.  (the Panasonics can cost as much as $70).  We have two pairs of the Panasonic glasses, and two pairs of the Samsung and both work well.  One thing about the included battery with the Panasonic - the battery that came installed in the glasses died during the first 3D show after about an hour - so the included battery was either weak or low quality.  It happened with both sets of glasses.  However, after installing a Maxell 2025 battery in each, they both have lasted through three 3D movies, and are still more than 80% full... so just be ready to have some spare batteries on hand for the glasses.  Overall, the Panasonic 3D glasses work well, are highly rated and I am satisfied with the experience.Smart TV Features and Navigation:If I had to sum it up, I would give a 6/10 so far for the Panasonic Smart TV interface and more importantly the \"navigability\" of the interface.  For the most part, it is satisfactory, but there is still major room for improvements.  Apparently, the Web Browser was not complete when they released the TV - you will have to see for yourself what I mean!  For instance - pressing the \"Help\" feature came up with a dialogue \"To be released later, under construction\" or something to that effect.  In other words, the TV's help feature is still being worked on - note I do have the latest software updates and all.  Plus, the Web Browser is, for all intents and purposes, kind of painful to operate.  It is very easy to \"accidentally\" hit the edge of the picture when trying to scroll with the scroll bars, and this results in the \"hyper scroll\" feature to kick in, basically frustrating you as the scroll kicks into hyper-drive and messes up the location where you are viewing.  Plus, things like weather.com - if you try to click on the Doppler map, it tells you this feature is not supported.  Finally, the interface crashed numerous times, especially when trying to view pictures / enlarge things at Costo.com.  There is more, but some of the reasons I think they can do a little more development / refinement of the Smart TV interface, and get something released hopefully soon.The access to Amazon, Netflix and more is well laid out and easy to use.  The responsiveness / speed of the internet is adequate - I am running the TV wirelessly and do not have any issues with the speed / responsiveness to date.  So that is good...The \"Break In\" Period (first 100 hrs):There is a lot of debate on whether there is a true \"break in\" period for TV's, especially plasmas, and what you read on the \"experts\" forums and what you get back from Panasonic can be very different at times.  To calibrate or not to calibrate?  That is up to you and your comfort level.  Realize most casual viewers don't and won't, but others swear by it.  I made the decision to just follow some simple rules during the first 100-200 hours of viewing, and NOT to calibrate my set. (other than maybe running the THX optimizer at some point).  Do your own searches on this topic, make your own assessment and decision - the \"right / wrong\" arguments on this topic are not scarce.  Do I think that the RIGHT professional calibration could squeeze out the extra 10% of picture quality out of the set?  Maybe... but I am not sure I want to spend the $$ to find out.  And I don't think I will regret that decision... YMMV.That being said - the simple rules I am following during break in:- I am not watching content for extended periods that has the black bars / letter box (aka 4:3 SD, 2:35:1 movies, etc).  If it is letterboxed, I just fill the screen with Zoom or Just or whatever works.- I am avoiding channels with a large degree of \"crawl\" on the bottom of the screen, and shows / games that have a lot of static content.  Plus, I am being careful not to leave the set on for extended periods with static menus / content. (it can be a challenge with two 13 yr old video game players as some of you know - but they seem to get it).- I have only allowed a couple of hours total of video games due to their high degree of potential static content - my boys are dismayed but they will live!- Finally, I am leaving the contrast, brightness and color settings pretty close to the default.  I am using THX cinema, and to be honest the default settings for this still throw up one heckuva picture, and do not need that much tweaking IMHO.- Other than those simple rules, I am enjoying the set and not worrying to much about things like the \"History\" channel logo, commercials with black bars, shows that have the dreaded crawl as long as they are not constantly on...In summary, every test I have thrown at the VT60 - whether it is viewing cable TV, playing older 480p movies, playing Bluray, viewing 3d or even when my boys use it for gaming - the VT60 never fails to impress and has passed with \"flying colors\" (pun intended!).  I continually marvel at the quality of the picture, and compared to the Samsung 7000 series LED I returned in favor of the Panasonic, I could not be happier with that decision.  There is no comparison; the Panasonic plasma just plain smashes the Samsung 7000 series LEDs in every aspect of picture quality, and it will do the same to many of the other TV's on the market.  Comparing the VT60 to a Samsung 7000LED is probably not a fair comparison, but just offering that as a data point. But then again, the Samsung was still $2600 new... so you be the judge.Would I recommend the Panasonic VT series, and would I buy it again?  Most definitely.  But take the time and decide for yourself, as the ZT series and F8500 series are also great TV's.Thanks for reading!!

Jaw Dropping Picture Quality and a Wonderful Design", "Author": "Josh Zastrow \"jfzastrow\"", "ReviewID": "R18LGOLCN1QE4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Panasonic TC-P55VT60 mid-April from Amazon. I have had a few days with it and would like to offer my thoughts.**Background**Previously I have owned a Samsung UN55F8000 55-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Ultra Slim Smart LED HDTV, LG INFINIA 47LE8500 47-Inch 1080p 240 Hz Full LED Slim LCD HDTV with Internet Applications, and Samsung LN46A650 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color. They were all very nice LCD/LED TVs but I was always upgrading for one reason or another. The VT60 is my first plasma. Having owned a small assortment of TVs I am happy to report the Panasonic VT60 trumps anything I have owned and frankly, anything I have ever seen up until this point. This TV produces the most amazing picture I have ever seen! My initial thrill has not worn off. This thing continues to impress me. The pq is absolutely phenomenal, even right out of the box!**Hands-On Review**TV came well packed and assembly of the stand was straightforward and incredibly simple. I do recommend you have a second person to help you. The VT60 is heavy.Initial setup is a breeze and pretty standard. Panasonic walks you through and shows you the included features, emphasizing their different home screen options. Fun fact: there is a silly narrator that sounds like a robot. I weirdly enjoyed it, a bit of 80s/90s nostalgia. I setup mine to go straight to the last source (HDMI) as opposed to my home screen. Also, there is a goofy advertisement that pops up at times. You can however turn it off in the settings.Panasonic includes two remotes. I am not a fan of the smaller remote. I find the touch track pad on it to be cumbersome.  Not an issue for me though as I use the included standard size remote. My girlfriend however likes the track pad. To each their own. I'm sure it takes a little getting used to.The apps work as you would expect. I haven't had a chance to check all of them out, but my time with Youtube and Netflix worked without a hitch.The TV itself looks wonderful. The stand and full glass panel make the TV a true piece of art. The glass itself does pickup glare and reflects light. I have a 7 foot picture window that lets in a ton of light directly opposite of the VT60 but it is not unbearable. I can see the reflection of the window but it is not any worse than previous TVs I have owned. I would argue it is better than my old LG LE8500 which also had a full piece of glass. All this doesn't matter though as I do most of my watching at night.As I previously mentioned, the picture quality on the VT60 is absolutely stunning! The hype for this set is true. The VT60 delivers on all cylinders. Inky blacks, clean whites, incredibly rich colors, jaw-dropping detail.  I've been watching in the included THX Cinema modes and haven't felt the need to make any adjustments. I am no professional calibrator but I would like to make it clear this is the best picture I have ever seen. You can certainly adjust the picture to your personal preference and their is no shortage of access for professional calibration if you wish to do so.As my first plasma, I am thoroughly impressed with the off angle viewing as well. Excellent blacks from any angle and the picture never seems to wash out or lose its integrity. There is certainly no clouding, ghosting, spotlighting, etc. to worry about. If I get unrealistically close to the screen, with my eyeball nearly touching, I can see a bit of dithering which is a function of the plasma technology.  It is used to prevent color banding and create a smooth gradient. It is not distracting and I only see it when my eye nearly touches the screen. From far away I do not see it at all.  It is not an issue but worth mentioning.I can't comment on 3D quite yet as I haven't had a chance view any 3D content. I've spent most of my time with blu-rays and streaming HD. I will update my review when I get a chance to sit down with a 3D movieI have added a few photos to the Amazon Customer Images section of Samsara [Blu-ray]on the VT60 . Pictures were taken at 1/13 F20. They closely represented what I was seeing on the screen, but I argue this still doesn't do the TV justice.  The picture produced on this TV is even better in person!Overall, the Panasonic VT60 is absolutely astounding!  I highly recommend the TV and am incredibly satisfied with my purchase.  The Panasonic TC-P55VT60 is worth every penny :)**Update 4/26/13**I wanted to update the review with a few other details after having more time with the TVThe built in speakers do not match the TVs picture quality.  They are about .5\" wide and are housed on either side of the TV. They run vertically. I believe the total speaker output is 20w (5w for each speaker and 10w for the built in sub). Honestly, out of all of the flat panels I have owned, the VT60 produces the best \"built in\" sound. That being said, I certainly recommend a better sound system if at all possible.  If you are spending this much on a high-end TV, do yourself a favor and pair it with a nice home theater sound system.  I realize this is not always an option, and if that is the case, the built-in speakers are adequate and do offer a decently full sound.The camera, when you want to use it, does pop-up automatically and can be activated via the touchpad remote with voice commands. No joke, you can actually talk to your remote and the camera will pop-up. Once the camera is up, it has facial recognition and will switch to personalized home screens if you wish. You can configure different \"users\" as well. I don't use the feature, but it might be convenient for family members who all watch different content and might use different apps.  A few things to keep in mind though. The camera is in a fixed position on top of the TV. If your seating arrangement is lower than the TV, you might not be in the best position to show up on the camera. Also, if you are like me, I keep the lighting in my home theater area to a minimum which is not the greatest lighting for the camera to pickup. The camera does pop-up, turn on, and turn off automatically but it does not retract automatically.The TV mounts easily on the wall and looks incredible!  I bought this Ultra-Slim Adjustable Tilting Wall Mount Bracket for LCD LED Plasma (Max 165L... (get it cheaper from Monoprice's website, item #5916).  The cables did not interfere with mounting at all as the inputs are on the side of the TV.  The power plug does come out of the back, but it doesn't stick out enough to interfere.  Just be sure to plug everything in to the TV first before putting it on the wall.Vierra Connect (apps) supports Hulu Plus and Amazon Movies.  I believe Amazon even lists how to \"register\" the TV in the item details section of the VT60 product page.I haven't noticed any \"image retention\" yet.  Panasonic includes \"pixel shift\" and \"screen wipe\" features on the VT60 to help clear up Image Retention if it ever occurs.  Being that it is a plasma though, I try to be cognizant of not leaving any static image on the screen too long just to be safe.The screen does reflect light.  In my experience, it is not any worse or any better than other flat-panel TVs I have owned.  I recommend curtains if you are putting the TV in a window filled room.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 55 inch TV money can buy: A critical review", "Author": "Dan134 \"dan134\"", "ReviewID": "RRF95X3SXINZ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Panasonic P55VT60 is without a doubt the best 55 inch television one can purchase.  Very low minimum light level means deep blacks and great contrast.  Colors pop without being unnatural, and motion handling is the best I've ever seen on a TV.  If you're in the market for a 60 or 65 inch TV, the ZT60 is slightly better with bright room viewing, at around 500 dollars more.As a gamer, this is a fantastic TV since Panasonic has really upped their game regarding image retention from last year's sets.  Leaving a static head's up display, score counter, or life bar for a few hours will leave mild image retention at the worst, and will be gone within a few minutes of pixel sweeper/mixed content.  Input lag also measures between 38-42 ms which means that all but the hardest of the hardcore, pro-level twitch gamers will not notice lag, but they aren't going to consider large screens anyway.  I play a lot of twitch games and can't notice or feel any sluggish response.All types of signals look the best they possibly can on the VT60.  Standard def never looks good on a 55 inch HDTV, but it's passable on the VT60.  720p signals look absolutely stunning, which is a step up from last years 50 series in which anything other than a 1080 signal was soft and had an \"oil painting\" effect to it.  That's not the case with the 60's.  Blu-rays and 1080p TV shows and games are absolutely jaw dropping.  You cannot get a picture quality this good on any other TV currently on the market, and this TV even matches or beats (VERY SLIGHTLY) the Pioneer Kuro.So why the 4 star review?This is the best TV I've ever seen, but it's not perfect and I can't in good conscience give it a perfect, 5 star review.  Here are the cons.-I previously purchased one of these from another retailer and immediately after receiving it, I noticed a dark line running down the right side of the screen.  After aging the panel for a couple hundred hours, the line got progressively worse.  I called up the retailer and set up an exchange.  When the new set came, the problem still existed but even worse.  I'm not sure if this was an issue with Panasonic, the retailer, the shipping company, etc., but I ended up getting a refund, purchasing ANOTHER one through Amazon and having ZERO issues with my current set.  Which brings me to the next con:-I had contacted Panasonic customer service about the issue I was having and in so many words, they said there was no problem with the TV and that any of the manufacturing defects I was describing were within spec.  This is not okay, considering the price of the TV.  Nothing is perfect, but a dark, half inch wide line running down the set is simply unacceptable for a reference level TV.  I've dealt with Panasonic before regarding other products and they are ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to deal with.  Probably the worst customer service of any electronics manufacturer.  Strange considering they make such great products, you would think they could spend just a little money to ensure that the people they hire to deal with technical issues can converse with customers and figure things out.  Instead the customer service reps try their absolute hardest to ignore you.  Such a weird concept to me.  Buy a 3rd party warranty or hope nothing goes wrong, because you do not want to have to deal with these people over the phone or via e-mail.-The price of the TV is very high compared to the almost-as-good-but-not-quite ST60.  The 55ST60 runs for about 1000 dollars less, which is insane.  The ST60 has very high input lag however, so it's a no-go for all but the most casual of gamers.  If you do not need a reference level set and do not play games, go for the ST60 instead.  It's a much better value and has amazing picture quality.  If you're not entirely sure what \"reference level\" means, you likely wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the ST60 and the VT60 unless they were side by side.  The VT60 is really a TV for videophiles and industry professionals.  I hope this doesn't sound snotty, as I'm honestly trying to save you 1000 dollars!  =)-The bezel and overall design of the TV is very bizarre to me.  It's got a great (non-swivel) stand, and the bottom part of the design is beautiful with a clear plastic trim that holds the on/off LEDS.  The one sheet of glass design is very sexy too.  What's odd is the built in speakers, which hurt the cosmetic appeal of the set greatly and add thickness to what could be a slim profile design.  Most people who are looking to buy a VT60 are not going to be using the built in speakers to begin with, which is why I question Panasonic's decision with this.  If this were a feature of the value models (the S60 and the ST60), it would definitely make sense, but it doesn't make sense on the reference level set.  Yes, this is a nitpick.This is it for my review.  Overall, for videophiles and industry pros (I use this for post production color correction), you cannot get a better 55 inch TV at the moment.  Accurate colors, the deepest blacks ever, and superb motion handling make this an amazing purchase.  Please take my criticisms with a grain of salt as I am one of the most critical people ever when it comes to technology.

To give you a frame of reference, I am a wholesaler in the high end AV business, and have been for 30 years. I have been trained by the worlds best manufacturers what to look for in TV's and what to listen for in Amps and Speakers. To give you a bit more background, my last 2 TV's were a 50\" Pioneer Kuro and before that, a 34 inch 16 by 9 CRT Sony XBR. Meaning, I know world class pictures like the back of my hand. I sold the magnificent Sony XBR after a few years because it \"shrunk\" thru the years (if you know what I mean) and bought the magnificent Pioneer Kuro. It also \"shrunk\" thru the years...so I sold it about 4 months ago.I studied the market very carefully, studied the worlds best 65\" Plasmas and LCD/LED's, talked to Americas finest AV Dealers and Installers, (many of whom I sell my speakers too) read all the pro reviews from magazines and sites all around the world...and it was a no brainer. I bought the 65\" version of the VT60 at a local dealer that knows me well. This Panasonic Plasma is utterly magnificent, don't let anyone tell you otherwise! The picture in THX mode is so stunningly good, with only minor tweaks to the color, contrast, and brightness modes, that I feel no real need for a pro calibration. (Yes, I know a Pro calibration would make it even better, but I'm not in a rush) I've had it about 4 months now and couldn't love the natural, creamy smooth, film like, \"organic\" picture anymore. Its that good!It just massacres the LCD/LED's out there, for naturalness. If anyone tells you different, they haven't seen this one set up correctly, or they have no knowledge of film like naturalness. LCD/LED's look so fake in comparison, so \"electronic\" so \"digital\" so \"paint by numbers\"...never mind the crummy viewing angles, the screen uniformity issues, and the mediocre blacks.I have no worries at all about image retention or burn in, and that's after watching tons and tons of broadcast HD, most of the channels having those stupid on screen logos. NFL, NBA, The World Series all looked gorgeous and Blu Ray discs are simply off the charts stunning!I cant comment on the built in speakers since I've never heard them. I use a serious home theater system for sound, and I cant comment on any of the \"smart\" features either since I haven't tried any of them yet. I also cant comment on the 3D effect as I haven't tried it yet. I can tell you when the sound is totally off I can hear the TV's fans whirling away softly, but the minute I turn up the sound a bit, the fans become inaudible. Lastly, the Square Trade/Costco deal on the extra few years warranty is so cheap I couldn't say no...and I always say NO to extended warranties! The set doesn't have to be purchased at Costco to buy the Square Trade/Costco extended warranty.I'll close by saying this...its incredibly sad that Panasonic cant turn a profit on Plasma and has announced they wont build anymore Plasmas as of early 2014. Dont be fooled, 4K LCD/LED still has all the traditional LCD/LED problems, and the pricing is terrible, and OLED is a few or several years away from being a mature/stable technology and the pricing is super terrible.If you love the very best, you will love the VT60 series from Panasonic, the pricing is super fair, Consumer Reports readers report that their Panasonic Plasmas are super reliable, so get it now, as you wont be able to get it as we get into 2014.I hope this review helps serious AV fans get and ENJOY the very best TV's in the world for 2013!", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Helpful Hints to Get the VT60 Be Even Better", "Author": "MariaEC", "ReviewID": "R5VHP0B7K6FE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to agree with all the superlatives mentioned by other reviewers of this product.

I connected the Bose speakers to my laptop (I am not sure how to connect them directly to my new Plasma TV), but I was having trouble with the audio. Every time I played something on my laptop (and since it was connected to my Plasma, I would be able to see everything on the Plasma), the audio was NOT coming from the Bose speakers, but from the Plasma TV's speakers. I realize that HDMI cables carry both video AND audio, but I wanted to have the audio come to my Bose speakers, NOT my Panasonic Plasma TV speakers (Bose sounds soooooo much better). I realized all I had to do was fix a setting on my HP laptop, not my TV.

Let's make a list!1. JB Hunt delivered my television. They did a great job. Two people arrived to install the set. They did everything that I asked. Give these guys a tip if they do a good job!2. The TV doesn't seem to have any productions flaws. I don't hear any fan noise at all. The build date is Sept 2013. I do hear some buzzing, especially on bright screens, but I have heard such buzzing on every large television that I have ever owned.3. If you are trying to decide between a VT60 and the less expensive ST60 (which is supposedly ALMOST as good as the VT60, but not quite), be sure to compare the prices. On the day that I bought the VT60 on Amazon, the 65\" version was $50 cheaper than the 65\" ST60. For some reason, there seem to be DEEP discounts on the VT60, but not the ST60 or the ZT60.4. Many on-line forums are comparing the 2013 Samsung F8500 with the 2013 Panasonic VT60/ZT60. The consensus seems to be: the Panasonics are better overall, with more accurate images and \"darker\" blacks, but the Samsung F8500 is brighter. Well, I have never seen the Samsung or the ZT60. But I can tell you that the VT60 is as bright as the sun. I have the contrast set on 80, and it probably needs to be dialed back a little. I watch in a room with a single window and an overhead light. It looks great in daylight, in the dark, and with the lights on. Who needs a TV to be brighter than this? Are you watching it on the beach? Are you watching a Tim Burton movie on the beach? The only issue where brightness might be a problem is 3D. I watched a few minutes of Prometheus in 3D and I guess it was kind of dark, but no darker than you see in a 3D movie theater. Perhaps the brain-searing brightness of the Samsung could help to compensate for the inherent dimness that you get with 3D glasses.  3D images look crappy anyway, though. Just get the Panasonic already.5. Screen reflections. I have read that the VT60's screen is a little bit more reflective than some other televisions. In fact, the screen seems to be the main difference between the VT60 and the ZT60. I have not seen a ZT60 in person, but I can tell you that the VT60 does not seem any more reflective than any other plasma that I've ever dealt with. I do see some reflections when I have my window open (it is off to the left of the TV), but I do not notice reflections in a dark room, or with a bright overhead light. The reflections are not a problem in my situation.6. Several people have mentioned a \"dark vertical band\" on the right side of the screen. My TV has this. Sometimes it's there, and sometimes it's not, and it's hard to spot unless you're looking at it (but not _right_ at it... kind of like the Milky Way!). I'll bet that you will see band this on every VT60 and ZT60 if you look hard enough. It is a curiosity, but it does not really make an impact on the overall image.7. I have not had any problems with IR. I don't play videogames on the TV, but I do watch a lot of shows that have static logos and news-crawls.8. The Netflix app with the TV works better than I expected.9. I'm sitting about 8.5 feet from this television. It is not too close, in my opinion. Blu Ray and \"good\" 1080i cable material, and HD Netflix material all look fabulous, with detail to spare. Even properly mastered DVDs look pretty good. Some 1080i cable material looks pretty bad, though, including lots of sports. If you want to maximize your Blu Ray experience, 65\" inch at 8.5 feet is GREAT. if you want to hide the flaws in ESPN's 1080i feed, for instance, or if you have a big DVD collection (instead of Blu Ray)... you might want to stick with a 50\" television at 8.5 feet.10. Is this TV better than a Pioneer Kuro?Apparently, the answer to this question is \"it depends.\" CNET has notably declared that the VT60 (and its upscale cousin, the ZT60) line of plasmas are \"equal to or better than our in-house Pioneer Kuro.\" Pioneer Kuros, of course, were legendary for their excellent picture quality, but went out of production in 2009. You have to read between the lines a bit, though. CNET's reference Kuro was a PRO-111FD. Many videophiles believe that the PRO-111FD model did NOT represent the pinnacle of Kuro technology. That honor is generally bestowed on the 101FD and 500M models. So, while CNET's VT60s and ZT60s outperformed their Kuros, it is important to remember that the Panasonics were not compared with the \"very best\" Pioneer Kuros.I own a Pioneer 500M. My 500M has a flaw... the \"reddish blacks\" that some people have complained about. Otherwise, its picture quality is stunning. Overall, I like my 65VT60 better than the 500M, mainly because it is larger (the 65VT60 is 65\" and the 500M is 50\"), but also because the Panasonic's \"blacks\" are extremely dark gray instead of extremely dark red.But there are some things that are better about the Pioneer. The Panasonic seems to produce some false contouring, especially in blurry backgrounds and other \"gradual\" color gradients. It is most notable during pans or other motion, and in glowing things, like flashlight beams. I don't see this on the Pioneer. Part of this may be because the picture is so much larger on the Panasonic. In fact, it could be that some of this false contouring is coming from the source, rather than the TV. It is hard to tell for sure. In general, though (perhaps because of the false contouring, perhaps because of the smaller size, of perhaps because of some other factor) the Pioneer's picture just seems a little sharper and crisper, and it seems to handle things like flashlight beams and moving fog better than the Panasonic.  (I should note that my Pioneer was professionally calibrated by ISF guru Chad B; I am merely using \"recommended settings\" for the Panasonic, at least for now. I can't imagine that an ISF calibration can remove the false contouring, though).I would say... if you have a really nice late model Pioneer with no flaws, it would not be wise to replace it with one of these Panasonics, especially if you are replacing size-for-size. If you are going for a bigger screen like I was, or if your Pioneer has a flaw, then a larger Panasonic is a fine upgrade.11. Overall, the Panasonic's picture is very nice, and it has become my primary home theater television.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture, but old tech w/ burn in!", "Author": "A. J. Way \"A.J. The King\"", "ReviewID": "R2MVG4BB961V53", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a new TV.  I wanted the best picture possible (without spending $6,000 on a new 4K TV set) for a 65\".  Unfortunately, I still paid almost full retail for this one as I was waiting for it to come out.  With such rave reviews from both experts and customers alike for the prior year model, this was sure to be even better.  I have always been apprehensive of buying a plasma as I was afraid of burn it.  I was assured that it is likely not to happen with this set as plasma has come such a long way over the years.  My prior TV was a Samsung LED that is about 7 years old.  I always loved the picture on that TV, but the blacks were not dark enough.So, after much research and waiting, I purchased this set (from a local retail store, not Amazon as they matched the pricing).  The TV itself is beautiful and well designed.  I like the look of it on the wall even when it is off.  I won't get into the technical aspects, and as you can read from all the other reviews on here, the picture is amazing.  However, I cannot recommend this set and do wish that I had just waited for a 4K or even OLED which should surface if a short while.  I am just going to share my personal experience with the set and hope that it helps others in their decision.The reason for the 3 star rating is as follows:Loss of one star for burn in.  I had the set only 2 months when I noticed a faint logo in the bottom right corner.  My wife likes to watch the channel Investigation Discovery and has it on this channel frequently.  They have a rather bright \"ID\" logo in the lower right corner, as do most channels these days.  Well, after only 2 months, it is now permanently burned into the screen.  Yes, the TV has a 'screen wipe' function which I use regularly to prevent this from happening, but it does not seem to help.  I find it very sad that my new $3,500 TV is already ruined by burn in, and as we all know, mfg warranty does not cover this.Loss of another star for wireless connectivity.  I enjoy Netflix quite often and was excited to have a TV that has this built in.  I usually use my PS3 to do Netflix and it is set up on my same wireless network.  Unfortunately, without fail, the TV disconnects from the wireless network within about 15-20 minutes of starting Netflix.  It doesn't just disconnect and reconnect either; I have to go back into the settings and input the network security code each time it does this.  I have since just gone back to using my PS3 for Netflix as it works without fail.Also, I know that people have listed that they don't like the sound.  I can't comment on this as I do not use the TV speakers at all and listen through my home theater system.  I can't imagine that someone would actually use the TV speakers on a set like this without a home theater.  But what can you expect from such small speakers on any TV?One last thing that people seem to dislike about this TV is the fan noise.  For me, I can only hear it when the sound is off.  If you have any sound at all, you can't hear the fan noise in my opinion.Anyway, I hope that this review helps you if you are looking at this set.  Again, nice TV, but I would wait if you can.  Plasma is just old tech and will likely not be around in a few short years.*** UPDATE 10/6 ***I have submitted 2 photos at the request of others on this site showing the burn in.  Please note that my wife has completely stopped watching the ID channel since my last review as I was so upset with the burn in.  I have gone so far as to run the screen wipe all night long to see if that would help as well.  Unfortunately, the burn in is still there.  I apologize for the poor photos, as there is quite a bit of glare on the screen, but you can still see what I am talking about.  The photo taken of the ID channel on was the first time it was turned on that channel since the last review, and I simply did it so you can see better where to look on the other photo.  When you look in the lower right corner, you will see a light area (glare), but look at the top left corner of that bright area and you will see a darker ID logo on the screen.To reply to a couple of comments related to my post, first let me say that this has not discouraged me from buying a Panasonic product as I do not feel that they are the issue.  The issue I have is the burn in.  That is related to the plasma technology used for this television type.  I don't feel that it would have been any different with any other brand.  Second, I am glad to post any more photos if you guys want them.  I know that these are not the best, but I wanted to get something up for you all to see.  As I stated, I post reviews to help others make an informed decision regarding a product, not bash a product (unless warranted).  I truly hope that my review has helped others in their TV buying experience and research.  Thank you all for reading my review!

I've had a few LCD tv's up to this point and this is my first plasma. After hours and hours of online reading and a couple of store visits I purchased the p65vt60 from amazon. Had planned on getting the ST but when the VT had a price drop I went with it. Thought about going with a 4k tv briefly but 4k will show a noticeable difference only on the ultra large screens. With the 65\" screen size and my viewing distance it wouldn't be worth it. I mostly will cover the areas that concerned me the most from reading various reviews.After unboxing it(very large box) and letting the tv warm up to room temperature, it was delivered on a below zero day, I turned it on and started viewing.  I have not done any type of break-in and from the start watched my regular programs and movies which include shows with banners and station ID logos, no burn-in and no image retention whatsoever.The picture is incredible, deep deep blacks really do make a difference, colors are very rich and gorgeous, quite the change coming from the dark gray blacks of my LCD that this set replaced. Right out of the box I set the tv to THX Cinema picture mode and that's good enough for me. The picture truly is amazing.I have the tv mounted on a wall and put my ear as close as I could to the back of the set, no fan noise and no buzzing.As far as the looks of the tv itself, beauty is in the eye of the beholder but to me it looks like a tv, I didn't buy it to be displayed as a work of art.Speakers on it are typical tv speakers not great not terrible, I run the sound through my home theater receiver and speakers so I don't use the speakers on the tv much.Those of you concerned about the picture being dim, to me it isn't. I have 2 big windows in the room with the cheap white mini blinds on them which let plenty if light in and the tv picture is fine for viewing. Right out of the box the tv is set to Standard picture mode and that setting is dim, just change to one of the THX modes or use a custom setting.There is a little reflection on the screen if the lights are on and you happen to sit were you can see them. How much reflection? More so than a matte screened LCD but less than a glossy one, I've had both so that's what my reference is and it doesn't bother me.I haven't played with the apps too much and don't plan to other than Netflix which loads fast and has played flawlessly.A few reviewers mentioned the ads which play when certain remote buttons are pushed, yes they are there, from what I had read I was expecting a long full screen ad but they are very short and small, I didn't even notice them for a week but if they bother you they are very easy to turn off.That's about it, just wanted to cover the areas that seem to be the most discussed, didn't get very detailed since there are some very good detailed reviews out there both amateur and pro.

Young \"Hello\"", "ReviewID": "R1PQLQQ1NDSXO3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update 05-07: Beware of the fan noise if you are the type to hear it more easily. I have struggled with the fan noise from day one unfortunately. The one hums constantly and can be easily heard on low-volume scenes and heard from across the room. As others have also reported having this same problem, I simply returned this VT60 versus trying another.  The VT60 is too expensive for any fan noise to be heard, normal or not.  That being said, the PQ is/was very good.  I never did get to try any gaming.  Screen reflections were a little hard to get used to, but I did.  No further updates since I did return this and it is already on its way back.These are really only first impressions as I have only had the 65VT60 since Thursday, 3 days.For now, I have this stand-mounted. The stand looks deceiving as it is fairly heavy.  The delivery guys perturbed me a little because when they removed it from the box so I could verify it worked ok, the one guy apparently had something sticky on his hands.  Part of the left side screen and side bezel had a sticky residue on it.  Took a bit of effort to get it all off, but I did.By Saturday night, the PQ quality has achieved a wonderful and delightful look. While watching ShowTime, the ShowTime screen came up where just their trademark was shown on the screen with an all black background.  I smiled because it looked just like the OLED screen on my wife's Nokia phone. All I saw was their trademark.  It was just a trademark, but the black was breathtaking because well, it was black.  Definitely an edge over the F8500.  I wanted to take a pic to share, but I changed the channel instead of pausing, so I could not go back on the DVR dang it. Maybe tonight.Most content types do look very good.  Naturally, standard 480i content is just OK.  Some better than others.  1080i is pretty good across the board and mostly because I have DirectTV.  1080P via DirectTV is perfect.  1080P playing a BRD from the OPPO likewise is beautiful.  I did have to adjust some settings though on the OPPO so achieve the best pic.  I don't really want to play with the VT60 settings just yet.The home screen concept quite frankly is the best attempt at a menu system I have seen on a TV (This is my first Panasonic).  You can make your own home screen and have the VT60 start on any you want.  Different users can have their own home screen.  Very personal computer like and since I develop software all day long on a PC, I am of course going to like this approach.  Making a home screen that is \"you\" is a great idea.I hear no buzzing on this unless I get really close with my ears.  It increases slightly on bright scenes, but again, you have to be close.  I do have a fan noise issue that from my reading on the Internet, others have posted about over the years with various Panny models.  My ears may be more prone to this than others since I work with the computer equipment that I do.  I found a filter solution someone else posted they did with their VT50, so I will try that first.  I have 30 days to exchange, so plenty of time to try other things.Daylight viewing is pretty good.  I think the F8500 has an edge with screen reflections, but the VT60 is close enough.  With night time viewing, the VT60 wins hands down.  Neither TV is calibrated professionally.  I did the F8500 myself with a WOW disc and I did not alter the VT60 at all.3D:  I played LOTR Hobbit today in 3D.  I selected this one to comment on since I also seen it in the theater (OmniMax) in 3D.  Even in daylight (I did not close the blinds), the 3D was good an strong. Not burry and the light from the windows did not cause too much of a problem.  No cross-talk that I could see.  The VT60 only comes with 2 pairs of glasses.  They fit well and are mostly comfortable.Lastly, the settings options on this VT60 are numerous to say the least.  That is obviously a good thing, but it is a little daunting to a novice like me.  I have so far settled (like others) on using the THX Cinema which produces a beautiful PQ.  Not so much with sports though.Oh, having the power light on while watching the VT60 in the dark is dumb. That little red light needs to go away.  I found some tape I am putting over it. If someone knows of a setting for this, let me know please.This is definitely a keeper and definitely a superb PQ.

I am happy to say it was, for me, money well spent - I have now achieved HDTV nirvana!Not surprisingly, all the new Panasonic TVs have deeper blacks - much improved compared to the 2007 model's blacks, but for the overall most realistic picture, only the VT or ZT models can equal the older top of-the-line 2007 Panasonic.  In comparison, the ST falls subtly, yet noticeably short on picture quality, no matter how I adjusted it.  BTW, when I got the VT, I adjusted it using the same picture settings as I had arrived at when tweaking the ST, and those settings were very close to optimum on the VT as well.Be advised that I am a video professional, and have calibrated studio monitors for a living in top TV studios in Silicon Valley, so I have super critical eyes for setting up and evaluating TV pictures.  Please understand that any normal viewer will likely be very happy with the ST model, but I could not live with it, not with a 2007 model in the same house showing better, more realistic pictures than the new ST did, (other than the deeper blacks).So if you are wondering if the VT is worth the additional cost over that of the ST price, my two answers are these:- If you want the absolute best picture, then the answer is clearly yes - spend the extra for the VT (or even more for the ZT)- If you are a more normal viewer and would be happy with \"only\" a very good picture, then save that extra money by getting the ST.  It is also the top rated value in its (lower) price range.A quick tip for making any TV look better:  With all TV's, the out-of-the-box picture settings are poor compared to a professionally adjusted TV.  Typically, the settings for color, contrast and sharpness are all set too high.  Try cranking those three picture settings down for a slightly less bright, but far more natural looking picture.  If you decide to get either the Panasonic VT or ZT model, you can simply turn on the THX picture settings - those settings are a BIG improvement over the default over-cranked factory settings.Also, I'd say that the other reviews I've read about these TVs are generally accurate, like when they say things like this:  the Panasonic VT and ZT lines are the best HDTVs currently available, unless you need the extra brightness of the Samsung 8500 for viewing in well lit rooms.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "First Plasma and Best TV I've Owned!!!", "Author": "Annie Chang", "ReviewID": "RBYD5OR25OM50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many others, I have done some research on my next TV to buy.

My friend suggested that i looked into Panasonic's plasmas since he has one from several years back and have been very happy with them.  I went to the major retail stores and compare the other TV's but nothing really stood out for me.  I did more research on the Panasonic's plasma and decided to go with Panasonic's plasmas based on all the good reviews and time for a change.  I took the leap and choseTC-P55VT60 based on recommendations from friends and great reviews, without even seeing the TV in person.  The VT did it for me since the ZT was out of my price range and ST was not \"eye-candy\" enough for me.Today, I received my Panny's TC-P55VT60 and am I glad I took the leap.  The only regret if any was I couldn't believe I waited this long to go with plasma. The picture quality on this TV is stunning.

While looking around at 60 inch TVs, I came across the universally rave reviews for the 2013 line of Panasonic plasma TVs. Praise is warranted, but with some caveats.The Panasonic Lineup for 2013 is \"XX60\", where the 60 is for 2013, incremented from last year's line that was \"XX50\". The \"XX\" represents the model and starts with the S at the bottom (not really worth looking at unless you're really budget strapped), the ST60, the VT60, and the ZT60. This review mentions a previous experience with the ST60, but is for the VT60.While 2012's line was lauded as it was, all the 2013 models have really gotten glowing reviews across the board. CNET called the ST60 it's \"strongest TV recommendation ever\" and that's saying a lot. The VT60 was, at the time it was reviewed, dubbed \"the Kuro-Killer\", because CNet (and several other sites) marked it as the first TV to surpass the venerable Pioneer Kuro, which has been the reigning champion for \"best picture\" among home theater geeks for several years since Pioneer left the plasma TV market. The consensus is that Panasonic has been slowly catching up (having picked up a lot of the talent that left Pioneer and 2013 was finally the year they beat the mark.After initially upgrading to the ST60, thinking it was a better overall deal (and that's probably still true), I ended up running into audio problems. Using the Optical audio output, I found that video and sound were out of sync and even after compensating for this using the audio delay feature on the receiver, the video and sound would get out of sync as we watched content. The gap grew. In trying to do an exchange to see if I had a bad set, the ST60s were out of stock, so I ended up getting a VT60.HOLY CRAP! The ST60 had an AMAZING picture, but the VT60 blows it out of the water. Noticeably better picture in every way. Colors are more vivid and accurate, blacks are unbelievably black if you've gotten used to an LCD/LED set (they'll remind you of CRT days!). It's a deliciously gorgeous image. The ST60 blew my old LCD HDTV away and left me stunned, while not quite the same jump, the VT60 is better enough that I'd say I wouldn't be able to go back to the ST60. From reading reviews and my own intuition, I'm willing to say the VT60's improvement of the ST60 is much greater than the ZT60's improvement over the VT60 (the ZT60 and VT60 share most of the same components as I understand).In addition to a more advanced panel, the VT60 also comes with some extra picture preset modes that make a big difference. The THX Cinema preset is pre-calibrated (THX Certified) and is outstanding to my eyes and already has all the image processing crap turned off. This is a really nice feature over the ST60, which does require a bit of tweaking in the settings.In addition, the VT60 comes with a better main remote control (primarily it lights up, which is a nice feature to have), an additional touch/trackpad remote to improve the smart TV features (nice to have, but not essential), and it has voice recognition (works but it's mostly a gimmick), and a built in camera (nice for using your TV for video conferencing without an additional web cam). To be honest, the smart TV features, while cool and perfectly acceptable, are less well developed than my old Samsung. But, I don't care about that. It has built-in Netflix/etc streaming, but if you want a browser and apps, you're better off just getting a 3rd party box and using that with it (iPad+Apple TV+Air Play work better than any TV's built in browser in my view). Like the ST60 and ZR60, the VT60 comes with 2 pairs of 3D glasses, and the 3D quality is better than the ST60 (although I can't vouch for that as I don't care about 3D). The ZT60 doesn't have all the other features, so this TV is a \"loaded\" option. If you like that, great; if you don't, then ignore them.The cost difference between the ST60 and VT60 was once a factor of 2! At the time of this review it is a mere $300, which to me makes the upgrade well worth the extra money. Extra features aside (they're nice, but they don't really matter in the end), the picture is better enough that I know where my extra cash went and feel confident in my choice. And I tend to dwell on such things!Happily, I'm no longer having audio sync problems. I don't know if the issue was a bad set or if it was a symptom of the ST60's input lag issues, but I'm glad to be rid of it and happy that the frustration landed me with a better set!A few things I must address:- The VT60 is not nearly as bad as the ST60 when it comes to input lag, but Google around and get some stats if you're a big gamer and are concerned. If you're going to watch movies, then forget all about this controversy.- This TV is plenty bright, even in a well lit room. Unless you're watching the TV in Best Buy, or have a real light problem, you'll be fine.- Can't attest to image retention/burn in, but don't bash plasma. I avoided a plasma last time I went TV shopping due to all the misinformation about them, but having done more research it's clear that the reputation plasmas have is based on popular misconception rather than fact. CNET has a great article dispelling plasma myths that keep people (like me) from buying them. I'm very happy I did more research this time around.- No, Panasonic isn't making any more plasmas after this year, but they are still in the TV business and are still a solid company. Should be supported for plenty of time to come. Actually, this is a great time to buy a Panasonic. Like Pioneer, Panasonic went out of the plasma market with a big bang!- Fan noise. Yes, the fan is loud enough to hear in a very quiet room. Most of the time, I don't notice it, even in quiet scenes, primarily because I sit far enough back and because I'm wrapped up in the movie. It's a valid criticism, and if you're easily annoyed it might annoy you. I don't think it's a huge problem, but I do wish they would have put in a quieter fan.In Summary:Unless you're buying the ZT60 or an OLED TV, you can't get a better picture, and the price is a steal.

I'm using this with a Panasonic 3D player model BDT220. I was concerned about it being too big for my party room, but Panasonic's recommended viewing distance for this TV is 6.89 feet or more. (My closest seat is 8' with my 'special' seat at 10'.) Set up was really easy as far as the TV goes. It is heavy so I had a friend help me with it. The base is solid and went together surprisingly easy. The hook ups are on the back at the left side (facing screen) of the screen and easy enough to get to.The set comes with 2 sets of 3D glasses. There is no case for them so I would recommend getting something to put them in. I bought the \"3Active Twin Storage case\", but if you have children you may want something sturdier.I also bought two extra pair of glasses, Panasonic TY-ER3D4(M/S)U, which I like better if only for the reason that they actually have a switch above the bridge of the nose to turn them on/off. The glasses that come with the TV just have an on/off button. A red light comes on when you turn them on, but then goes off so you don't really know if they are on or off without looking at a 3D image.There are two remotes that come with the TV. One is a normal remote and is decent for a remote. The other I haven't tried yet. It allows you to use voice commands and gestures to control the TV.There is a built in camera at the top of the TV. I haven't used this at all yet.Since my blueray player connects with Netflix, Amazon Prime, and YouTube I don't see myself using the TVs internet services that much. (I run my blueray player through my Denon AVR-1912 receiver with Energy Take 5.1 speakers.) I will see what it has to offer as I'm sure they've updated things since my blueray player. There is an HDMI out that I could run to my receiver or even just the optical audio out. (Sorry, thinking as I write!)To calibrate the picture I used the Consumer Reports recommendations:Picture Mode: CUSTOMContrast: 100Brightness: 7Color: 49Tint: 2Sharpness: 0Color Temp: Warm2Aspect Ratio: Full (H size 1, Overscan-Off) - I didn't find this one.Motion Smotther: WeakPanel Brightness: MidColor Gamut: NativeGamma: 2.43:2 Pull down: OnBlack Level: LightAll others either Off or 0Some of the settings take a couple steps to get to, but other than the aspect ratio I found them all.The screen is really clear and looks awesome! In 3D mode with the glasses, the screen dims a bit. I have black out curtains in the room, but yesterday the sun was out (yeah!) and light that seeped around the curtains caused reflection of the room when the screen was dark. During normal viewing it wasn't noticable. At night with the light on (an overhead light) it wasn't bad, but I prefer the viewing with the lights out.First we tried to watch \"Bait\" in 3D. I thought it would be more 'in your face' type 3D, but you could see there where building up to it. I just didn't have the patience to wait. We watched \"Avatar\" and it was incredible! It really felt like you were there. This isn't my childhood fantasy of a holographic movie room, but it's pretty cool.I watched \"Mirror, Mirror\" in 2D and could see how it would be really good in 3D. I turned on the conversion, 2D to 3D, and it was good, but wearing the glasses and the dimmer screen was a bit more than I was willing to put up with.I was shopping for this or one of Samsung's plasma F5500 series TV's. The 60\" Samsung has the best 3D of any TV according to Consumer Reports and both were less expensive, but this one was the only one that came down in price. That was my sole reason for choosing the Panasonic. That said, so far I'm thrilled with my choice!As I watch this TV and learn more about it or if I have any problems I will update this review.I hope this is helpful and will update as I learn more.

One person showed up to deliver this TV forcing me, the customer, to have to help carry the item and uncrate it.  When I say the crate this TV comes in is large I mean tremendous and it is a heavy, very heavy TV. Before you take delivery, Contact the company and INSIST THEY SEND AT LEAST TWO DELIVERY PERSONNEL TO HANDLE THE JOB.  The box was heavily torn and tattered somewhere along the way in transit but once uncrated the TV did not appear damaged and power tested as it should. Pay attention to the detailed delivery description. I knew this going in but some may not notice it.  The enhanced delivery will only bring it to the room of your choice, uncrate it, and power test it. Power test it means plug it into an outlet until the blue screen comes on. They will NOT attach the stand that it comes with which means you will have to lean it on something or keep it in the bottom portion of the crate to keep the TV upright. After delivery You will also need a second person to maneuver the TV around to attach the stand.

Make sure the plasma TV is in a viewing mode (aspect ratio) that completely fills the screen. The panel is shipped in this condition, in what is called the \"Just\" mode.2. Change the Picture Mode from Vivid to Standard or Cinema. Cinema would be best.3. Briefly engage the 4:3 aspect and confirm the side bars are set to \"Mid\", or \"Bright\". This can be adjusted in the Set Up menu.4. Always return the display mode that fills the screen (such as Just, Zoom, Full, or H-FILL).5. Try not to view channels with stationary backgrounds or logos for extended periods of time.6. Avoid extended display of static images (video games, computer images, DVD title screens, etc.).

After researching the products out there, I decided I preferred the  picture of a plasma over the current LED technology. I purchased the TC-P55vt60 after intensive research of all available web locations I could find, reading many reviews, and also showroom viewing. I don't normally write my own reviews but I feel somewhat obliged to return the favor to others who may be in the market for a new HDTV. After two months of use, here are my thoughts.For the record, the TV is located in my Family Room, northeast corner of the house. There are windows, but no direct sunlight. During the day, you can see some reflection from the windows. But I'm coming from an old CRT screen so I'm used to a little reflection during the day. Obviously, at night, no problems.First, it's a great TV, nice picture, colors great, and the blacks just about what you would expect if you've done any research on this TV. I use the vt60 mostly for over the air broadcasts with a lot of sports viewing. Basketball, football, baseball and yes, hockey all look excellent. No problems with white balance on hockey whatsoever. As a hockey fan this was one of my concerns. Forget about your concerns, this is a great TV for watching hockey. Additionally, this TV is more that bright enough to handle any viewing requirements. I can't imagine anyone needing a brighter picture.I have a receiver and speakers I use for movies, but, the sound from this TV is noticeably better than most flat panel HDTV's on the market. For most general TV watching, I just use the sound from the TV.I have watched a few bluray movies and there again, the picture is phenomenal.As for settings, I just set it on THX Cinema and everything looks fine to me. I have experimented with other settings (CNET, WOW dvd, etc.) but I have found the changes subtle. So, I just leave it on THX Cinema.Image Retention/Burn IN: I saw a VT50 in a Best Buy Magnolia showroom that had the CNN logo BURNED IN. I know because I went back to the store several times last year and the logo was always there. So, I believe it can happen.  However, I have found concerns like Image Retention, or Burn In  to be non existent with the VT60. Like I said, I watch mostly TV (sports, cable news, etc.) and there has just not been any signs of IR, none. And I'm not jumping around channels or any of that kind of stuff to prevent it. It's just not happening on this HDTV.Fan Noise: I can only hear the fan noise when I put my head behind the screen. With the TV on and any sound on I can't hear anything.I haven't tried the 3D features yet. When I do, I'll up-date.In summary, if you're looking for picture quality, the VT60 is a great choice.

Bates \"abates\"", "ReviewID": "R13V54YD232B06", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replaced my 42\" 2007 Panasonic plasma with the 55\" VT60 about a month ago.  I had been holding out on getting a new TV - my 42\" was still running fine - but as a big fan of both plasma displays, and Panasonic, when it was announced that 2013 would be their last year in the plasma market, I jumped on this when it showed up on the Cyber Monday sales.  I'm really glad I did.The price - $1499 - was almost exactly what I paid six years ago for my 42\", and is about as much as I am willing to spend on a TV.  I know I could have gotten bigger TVs, or higher resolution TVs, for the same price or less, but I was not looking to sacrifice build quality, nor picture quality.  The build quality on the VT series is superb; a full metal back, solid stand and nice, without being gaudy, design.  The picture quality is as good as everyone says and, while it was certainly a step up from my 42\", I can't say that it was twice as good - just better; deeper blacks and more natural color reproduction were evident pretty much as soon as I watched my first hour on it.When I bought it, all I really wanted was a good display.  I didn't plan to use any of the built in apps, nor 3D, nor the camera.  Frankly, I would have, at the time, preferred it if Panasonic offered a identical display, for 20% less cost, that stripped all of the \"extra\" features out.  As it turns out, I use both the Netflix app and the DLNA client all the time, preferring them to the ones on my Roku.  I've used the 3D features a few times with 3D netflix movies and was impressed...don't know if I will watch much in 3D, but was pleased to have it in the end.  And the built in camera/Skype app are actually really pretty good, though if I had the TV wall mounted, it is unlikely if I could get the viewing angle right for the built in camera (it doesn't have much in the way of up/down pivot).Delivery of the set was easy and considerate.  Two men showed up within the two-hour window I was assigned.  They brought the set in, unpacked it and set it up on my stand, and stayed while I tested all the inputs to confirm everything was working.  Really pleased with the delivery service - so much easier than purchasing at a retail location, trying to squeeze it into my car, then lug it into the house myself.Overall, great TV, great price and a happy customer.

I had already owned an ST model, and after viewing that picture, I bought the VT series. I will not repeat the accolades about the picture quality; just to say, \"I agree with the superlatives.\" I wanted to just review a highlight and a lowlight.The highlight is in a peculiar place: the shipping box. The shipping box has an ingenious construction, with a low-boy base, holding the TV and accessories, and a high-boy cover that goes over top of it. The cover is held on by four ingenious plastic fasteners that come off with a squeeze and a pull. Then the box top just lifts off. I know this has nothing to do with TV, but getting an 80 lb. set out of the box could have been a trial. With this arrangement, it was easy. Kudos to Panasonic on this detail.Now the lowlight: The ethernet design includes a feature \"wake on LAN\", which must be enabled, that allows the set to be controlled by a wired network (no Wi-Fi) even when it is OFF. However, the set does not broadcast on the network when it is off, so it cannot be found by the mobile remote control app \"TV Remote 2\". Now The TV does respond to the \"power-on\" command from TV Remote 2, but if one searches for the TV, the app will go into \"Test mode\", since it finds nothing on the network. I have put the TV on a static IP address, so its network address will not change, and the remote app will use the old address and control the set. However, the lack of network broadcast is unforgivable, especially considering that a $100 Panasonic BD player does broadcast on even the wireless network when it is powered off. Also my Sony BD player, and Yamaha network AVR broadcast over the network when powered off. Note that the set really will not respond when off: the ping command from a PC on the same subnet gets a \"Host unreachable\" error.

I like everything about the TV, but at the moment, I'm still having trouble experiencing these \"inky blacks\" that everyone is talking about.  The TV it replaced was a Samsung 46\" 8500 series which is the last true local dimming set made by Samsung (I believe).  Well, the blacks on that set (which has never been professionally calibrated) are so black that you can't tell the screen from the bezel, AND, if a scene is playing that is all dark or mostly, you would be hard pressed to tell whether the TV is actually on (until the scene changes).  So, this is what I'm used to.  Based on all the rave reviews from the VT50 then the VT60, I was expecting no less, but maybe even better (if that was possible).First of all, I have customized the settings for the Cinema THX mode as well as the Cinema mode using CNET's calibration settings for the VT60.  I can still see the bezel during dark scenes both via Netflix and my Oppo Blu-ray.  Overall, the picture looks great, but from all the reviews I think that I shouldn't be able to see the bezel during the blackest scenes.  Has anyone else noticed this or have something to share regarding this?  I've read there's a break-in period of 150 hours but CNet didn't have their test unit for that long and they still called it the first true Kuro challenger. So, I'm still out to lunch on the inky blacks performance.  I'll keep working with the different settings to see if I can achieve this pure black, but it seems to me if it was that easy to achieve that on a 2009 LED model then it certainly shouldn't be that difficult to get this on a True Kuro Challenger in 2013!  Other than that, I am extremely happy with my purchase...beautiful, gorgeous 65\" mini theatre screen in my den.7/2/13 (UPDATE)I am compelled to add this update to the 65\" VT-60 that I purchased in May.  In my first update I was uncertain about the superb contrast claims by others.  I WAS WRONG!  After owning this set for 2 1/2 months the set (in my opinion) has gotten better.  It has shown nothing but a superb picture including contrast.  I have adjusted my previous rating of 4 stars to 5 as a result.  I am seeing some Netflix content that now rival some of my best blu-rays and bests my mediocre blu-rays!!!  An absolutely outstanding picture.  I was quite concerned when deciding to buy the 65\" version that it might simply be too large for my den, after all, I was moving from a 46\" that I had used for the past 3 years.  When I installed it, it was quite large.  That soon went away after a couple of weeks.  NOW, with a picture as superb as this, I would advise everyone to start at 65\"!!!  This plasma will make you want to go up to a 75\" or larger (even though Panasonic doesn't make those sizes).Buying this set is money well spent.

FInally decided on the VT60; glad i did.When you initially get the tv it starts you up on a screen with all of the apps, etc...i didn't want that; when i turn on the tv i want to see the full tv screen; thats primarily what we use the tv for! it took a few clicks and some time (probably longer than if i was 20 years younger) but was finally able to make the home screen the full tv screen.the picture itself is truly amazing. when comparing to lcd/led tv's, all i can say is that the picture on this plasma set looks 'warmer'. i compared sets side by side at the local best buy and it really was no comparison. of course once you get a new tv in your home anything out there is going to look pretty damn good. but side by side, i thought this picture was the best. one other disclaimer: i also saw the ZT60; it if anything had an even better picture when viewed side by side, but i didn't think the difference was that big to justify another $500+.There are numerous picture modes to choose from. Initially our set kept changing back to the default 'vivid' setting every 90 minutes...again took some time and a few clicks but managed to turn that setting off.I found some settings to try in a prior amazon review, and also tried some settings i read about in a cnet review; we liked those and have kept them. our room is fairly dark (see below) so the brightness of the screen is really not an issue for us. yes, the samsung 8500 had a noticeably brighter screen in the showroom next to the VT60, but in more normal home conditions my opinion is the VT60 had the superior picture.sound was important to us, as both my wife and i are experiencing age related hearing loss. i picked this set over the ST60 in part because the sound is supposed to be better with this set. we do have a soundbar we used with our prior set, and i have set it up and have used it with the VT60 a few times, but overall the sound from the tv is acceptable. another reviewer complained there is not a switch to turn off the tv sound...using the remote to turn the sound off directly (when using a sound bar) works fine.i've read from some reviewers that the noise from the back of the set is bothersome; to be honest we can't hear anything, even when we're fairly close to the set (sometimes suffering hearing loss can be an advantage i guess...)i have used some of the apps (netflix/amazon) and they seem to work fine. setting up our wifi network was easy. also tried the voice controlled smaller remote...i asked it to find something, and surprisingly it did. not sure how much i'll use that feature but what the hell, it worked when i tried it. haven't tried the camera yet (and probably won't). read some reviews that dinged this set for not turning on its base; as we have a fairly large family room with seats far enough away that is not an issue for us. we also haven't tried 3D; probably never will, and did not buy the set for that purpose anyway.so why isn't this tv perfect? the glare. it really bothered me at first. we have a window in our kitchen that is maybe 40 feet away from the tv...when the sun sets on that side of the house you can see the window glare. doesn't bother my wife, but bothers me. we even have blinds, but they aren't the blackout type. the good news is that it's only an issue (for us at least) for a few hours late in the afternoon. otherwise we can also see some home lights (lamps etc) reflect but it's tolerable. we didn't see this with our lcd sony bravia,  but we also didn't have as good a picture as we do now. i have read that one can try 'bias' lighting behind the set that can apparently cut down on glare; we haven't tried that as yet but may do so down the road.so to conclude, glare can be an issue, but it's common with all plasma's, and can be easily overcome. the picture on this set is truly amazing. are we happy we bought it? after 2 weeks, i would say definitely yes.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"extremesims1\"", "ReviewID": "RWXI8HKN7U6NA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first plasma television set.

What was interesting is how the folks at Best Buy were pushing the LEDs, but when questioned as to what they would buy, they all picked plasma TVs. If you are used to LED TVs, you'll find the picture of the TC-P65VT60 to be a bit dim. You do not get the absolute brightness of an LED. At first, I was disconcerted, as I am used to the brightness of my Sony XBR.However, once you adjust to the dimmer screen, you really get to appreciate the picture. More subtle variances in contrast, a better shift of colors, and no retina-searing blindness with some scenes.

Secondly, Panasonic Corporation decided to stop production of plasma TVs and I could not pass up an opportunity to purchase this TV while I still could (also at a discounted price).BLUF:Plasma screens are not for everyone. They provide exceptional, unbelievable picture quality but it comes with a price of being careful of what you are watching to avoid image retention (IR) or image burn-in. IMHO they fit best as a home-theater piece rather than every day TV for your living room with a lot of light in it.Details:I spare you all the details about packaging, looks, remotes, etc., you can read other reviews or walk into a local brick and mortar store to look at it.Panasonic plasmas have a very dedicated following among AV enthusiasts. If you spent enough time researching you'd run across these forum articles on the initial setup and break-in: [...]I decided to follow it, but yet to complete the initial 100 hrs. of break-in. I immediately reduced contrast on all inputs (they are independently controlled) to 45 and made sure to watch all content in zoom if it displayed top/bottom bars. My primary source of signal is Apple TV; I have a good collection of movies on iTunes.Picture quality on this TV is simply outstanding. You'd feel you are sitting in a movie theater. In fact, we went to see the second installment of The Hunger Games where I paid very close attention to the picture (movie theaters mostly use 4K projectors). The Panasonic at home, when I viewed The Hobbit, was as close to that quality as your eye could discern.This TV is heavy, so be careful when hanging it. It may require a more robust mount, like Mount-It with full motion swing for 42-70 inch TV.This TV has inputs on its left side, so make sure your HDMI cable(s) reach from wherever your equipment is located.Overall, I am very pleased, despite all the care I need to observe with the content to avoid image retention.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic picture, great deal.", "Author": "Lyndi Rice", "ReviewID": "RAF5Q382LMQRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love love LOVE this TV.

It recently died, six months out of manufacturers warranty. However, repair was impossible because Panasonic no longer makes replacement boards for the VT30 (after less than two years on the market!). After bickering about the vagueries of my extended third party warranty in this apparently spectacularly unique set of circumstances, I was finally offered the VT60 as a replacement (score!). I called Panasonic with some questions.  1) Is there anything I should avoid watching during the break in period to avoid permanent burn-in, like static images? Five minute hold. Panasonic replied \"No, there are no restrictions on what you can view during the first 100 hours of break in.\" I said \"Are you *sure*?\". Five minute hold. \"Ummmmmm . . . don't watch any sports\". I said \"By sports do you mean *any* channel that has static content like scores, a news ticker, a logo etc? Or for that matter the built in web browser?\". \"Ummmmmm . . . yes\". 2) Has the VGA input been removed from this model? Yes. 3) Are the 2 pairs of included 3D glasses rechargeable? No. 4) Are the 3D glasses from my VT30 (5 pairs) compatible with the VT60? No.  So I would urge everyone to get the longest extended warranty available (hey, we're talking about Panasonic here), and be absolutely certain what their policy is when your tv dies and cannot be repaired. Will you have any out of pocket expenses? Will they come to your house? If you don't like their selection of replacement tvs can a portion of your original purchase price can be used toward an alternate selection? What is that portion, 100%, 50%, 0%?  Finally, the image is spectacular. Passive 3D glasses would have been a welcome change, with the active glasses I can only watch 3D for 30 minutes at a time. I do wonder why Panasonic added the distracting silver metallic border and stand. Movie screens do not have reflective silver metallic borders. The VT60 sits much higher on its stand than the VT30, which I like. Gone are the proprietary cables required to connect almost everything. The two remotes are a welcome feature, as are the speech recognition in the smaller remote and the bluetooth keyboard capabilities.

I was very impressed with it... very crt like picture with perfect geometry. Little to no glowing streaks from alot of movement of bright images in a black background, like a white mouse cursor moving across the screen. In closer inspection of the picture, I noticed dithering dots blinking very fast, I read about and its normal for a plasma, that's how it creates a picture.Year later or so, I bit the bullet and got me a 50inch g25. It had about the same picture and slightly better black levels but it was quite a bit bigger than the last one, more impressive gaming and movies on it.I saw the rave reviews of the VT30 so I order one of those, the 55 inch version. Sold the g25 to a buddy of mine, he was very impressed with it so he had to have it when he already had a sony 55inch led. He is crazy like me, lol.The VT30 again looked about the same as the G25 in black levels, slightly better blacks but the picture was more impressive overall, more pop.I sold my VT30 to my dad when his 7 year DLP went out and had and excuse to get me another and hopefully my last for at least 5 years. I read about the VT60 and that it had a better picture than the VT50, I was all over it.Finally got the VT60 60inch about 2 months and WOW, Huge improvement compared to the VT30, Finally, the last 2 were just miner updates. The black levels compared to the VT30 is massive, makes the VT30 look grey and dull in comparison. To this day I still get impressed. I have a LG 30 inch lcd computer monitor and the tv next to it hanging on the wall. I play my pc games on the tv in 1080p when i am in the mood, dark games especially look awesome.The APPs on the tv rocks, Netflix Is a heck of alot better compared to the VT30, A search function!!!.The 3D is better, does not not hurt my eyes as compared to the VT30 but I really never use it but I like it that its there.I hook my PS3 and Wii to it, PS3 looks really good, as expected, heck so does the Wii for what it produces, the new zelda is bright and colorful. Fzero GX looks really cool on it.I see no reason to get a 1080p oled of the same size, no desire to get a 4k tv when I have this tv. A pc monitor is different, I would not mind going above 2560x1600 but I would rather have an oled monitor, Im kind of spoiled after looking at this tv, dark movies and games look way better and more atmospheric.My cons are it produces quite bit of heat, no big deal.A little glare on bright days.Pc desktop does not quite look as good as the lg, a little dimmer and slightly fuzzier picture, it beats it everywhere else except resolution.This is not a con, I hear no Buzz from this tv, I do little from the vt30.Overall It was worth the money.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Amazing picture quality!", "Author": "jaroslaw e ziaja", "ReviewID": "R3B9MWXG1SS17O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this TV for a week now and I love it.  Since it is my first Smart TV I'm still learning all the features that it offers (and there's a lot of things to learn here).  Originally I bought Sony Bravia KDL- 55HX850 2012 model but after 2 hours of operation it developed a horizontal line of dead pixels across the screen and I had to returned it back to Sony, they didn't have the same model and agreed to buy it back.  Thank god this happened because after this negative experience with Sony and LCD TV I decided to give a shot at plasma.  I knew that Panasonic makes the best plasma TVs out there so I got the Viera TC-P55VT60.  I have to stress here that when it comes to picture quality this TV blows Sony Bravia into little pieces!  After little calibration with Panasonic iphone app the picture quality is just beautiful, the blacks are truly black, (bravia had a blueish tint to it no matter what I did) horizontal viewing angle is much better then on the bravia too, sound quality as well.  All in all it's just a better quality TV.I think the only negative thing that I coud find so far is the fact that during the day the light coming from my big windows reflects from the glass panel.  but I can live with it.  The TV is really bright during the day so for the ones that worry about plasma being too dark during the day I say that's not an issue with this TV at all.  I also red somewhere that one guy complained about noise coming from the heat fans on the back of the panel.  I notice that the fans make a little noise when tv is muted but it's not a problem at all when the sound is on, even at low sound level you can't hear the fans at all.So far I'm really happy with this purchase.

But with the news that Panasonic is exiting the plasma tv manufacturing this month - and that the latest generation of planny plasma's have some of the best picture quality ever produced - and Amazon's great pricing (The VT60 series was actually less than the ST60 series)- we decided to spring for the TC-P65VT60 65 and did get the 5 year square trade extended warranty. We have had ZERO issues with our two previous panny's and they're still running.4K TVs are coming out of the gate fast- but they are all LED lit LCD's at this point - or OLED- and have the same viewing angle restrictions and fast motion limitations as any 1080P LED lit LCD - supposedly plasma tech can not be extended to 4k TV's..so the end of an era?  Samsung is continuing to make plasmas - but no 4K versions AFAIK (as far as I know). Yes, I know LCD's/OLED's are less subject to reflections in brightly light rooms.Delivered yesterday, Saturday, within the delivery window -  by CEVA - they did a great job - brought into the house, unpacked, assembled onto stand, turned on to verify operation, offered to take packing materials (I wanted to keep them). No issues at all with them. .TV arrived in pristine condition. Menu Setup was easy - just a few steps. Started with wi-fi connectivity - and I then immediately did a software update to the latest minor rev. Running through the \"burn in slides\" now (google \"d-nice\" and ignore the warnings about using the slides) . Did that on my previous 50\" panny and never had any problems with image retention. I'm interspersing running the slides with some more in depth setting up.  There is a debate over whether it's necessary to run the burn-in slides - with some saying that if Panasonic doesn't recommend it - you don't need to do it. Just remember Panasonic doesn't warrant your TV against IR (image retention) - like the \"ghost\" logo's you may see on TV's in the department stores that are on the same station 24x7 with static station logo's and banners on them.Tried the included 3d glasses (they're model TY-ER3D5MA). They worked perfectly - no issues at all.There is on-line confusion about which model of active shutter 3d glasses are included - and the 3d glasses model may have changed since this TV was first introduced - I don't know. They paired easily with the tv. Just push the single button on the glasses for 1 sec and TV announces in seconds that it's paired. The glasses instructions don't tell you that they're battery powered. To get to the CR2025 battery -push the nose piece firmly down from the top and swing out. Thanks google :) - because the included 3d glasses instructions do NOT mention this - but the TV manual does mention that they're micro(mini?) usb rechargeable - they aren't.  You can find non-panasonic 18$ equivalents on Amazon - but be sure to read the Q&A;'s to ensure the one's you pick are active shutter and work with the VT series of TV. Evidenlty you don't get the \"paired\" message from those - but they work - and that's much cheaper than Panasonics $79 or via Amazon 49$. I've got a couple on order.Later - I went with a LAN switch and a wired connection to the TV - no interaction on my part to switch from wireless to wired - the TV just switched over to it. Nice.Now to limited AV inputs - This TC-P65VT60 65 has 3 HDMI, 1 antenna coax, 1 set of 5 connectors that you can use for EITHER composite or component inputs. There aren't enough legacy inputs in my opinion -and a modern TV should have 4 HDMI inputs!Optical SPDIF/Coaxial Digital TV output= digital audioNo analog audio out - If you have shift workers in your household and have sennheiser rf wireless headphones in order to NOT use the tv's speakers during their sleeping times- you'll be disappointed that there is no analog audio out. There is digital audio out - all it takes is another 40$ to buy an adapter that that converts the digital audio to two RCA left/right outputs that my headphone base station expects. Not that you're not going to get dolby digital or 5.1 sound out of two RCA left/right headphone jacks. Many of these digital to analog adapters REQUIRE the TV be set to output \"PCM only\" on the digital audio output. The panasonic supports this. There have been reported problems with OTA (over the air) audio through these devices. I don't have it yet in order to test that.My setup - 1 std def dish tv receiver only has s-video or lower-res composite outputs. 1 direct tv - hdmi output, 1 all region dvd player - HDMI output, 1 karoke dvd player - - component video out, 1 Magnavox 1 TB DVR (Walmart) with composite out. So I have too many old style inputs - maxed out on HDMI inputs (and I don't have a blu-ray - yet:) ). I found the j-tech digital converter box on Amazon for 135$ and am using it - but it doesn't have an s-video input- and it may be occasionally dropping audio and video - I'm still troubleshooting that. Another 50$ will buy an s-video to hdmi  converter.Maybe I should have went with an av receiver to for all my \"legacy\" av hardware connections:)Let's see 135$ j-tech converter, 40$ digital to audio converter, $50 s-video to HDMI converter :) Guess you can get a low end AV receiver for 225$...The TV starts with a cluttered screen of apps, widgets, menus, etc. Easy to turn off once you know where in the menu's to find it (or google it) . Now when turned on - it starts with full screen tv - just like the old tv :) Change is hard :)I did setup the Amazon prime app - very easy to do - BUT it doesn't have the \"watch list\" like the Roku Amazon Prime app does AFAIK (I have two of the Roku Gen 2 devices on older TV's). Disappointing. I'm still investigating if there are 3d movies on Amazon Prime - at this point - I'm not sure - it wasn't obvious from a quick scan. UPDATE: AVSForum is reporting that the TV will detect 3d content and an option will appear to watch in 3d after initial seconds of streaming of some - non 3d designated movies like Avatar - on Amazon Prime.Fan noise - it a quiet room - you can hear a faint hum from one of the two fans - the fan on the right side (from the front). It is much louder if you're behind the TV, not much bleeds around to the front. A google search reveals that the latest production changes include some type of noise dampener on those fans. bottom line -it's not a big deal to me and it doesn't affect the TV speaker audio otherwise. And I definitely won't hear the fans with my headset on. :)The large full-function Remote is relatively easy to figure out.TV has a  black painted steel sheet metal  backplate - not plastic like the others I'm told- feels solid and rigid - and no doubt helps with torsional rigidity during shipment and handling.Haven't played with the built-in camera (skype and face recognition) - widely seen as a gimmick.Haven't setup or played with the smaller secondary remote control.OTA Setup - Over the Air (antenna) setup was easy - once I changed the option to \"Antenna\" instead of \"Cable Box\" before starting the scan - hehe - still getting used to the menus is my only excuse :) . The OTA automatic channel scanning worked perfectly and the OTA pictures look great.Picture - no dead pixels that I can spot during the burn-in slide phase. Screen settings are purposely reduced to less contrast and brightness for the first 100 hours of operation- so can't really comment on picture quality - but there are hundreds of reviews out there that speak to the \"best tv picture ever\" or \"best tv picture\" since Pioneer's Kuro series.I have a \"low light\" viewing room - so the high reflection tv panel has not been an issue so far.AVSForum reports that there are default picture settings (THX Cinema and THX Bright Room) that are as good as professional calibration - I did buy the Disney HD TV Calibration and Setup DVD and may give it a try after my burn-in slides finish (100 hours total)...Aesthetics - the wife likes the base and bezel - so YEAH !...and she kinda like the 3d affects on Direct TV's 3d channel...we did not buy this set for the 3d...(side comment - if all incandescent bulbs are outlawed in the U.S. 100 W last year, 40 and 60 W in Jan 2014 - and 3d TV glasses get beat patterns/visual interference from fluorescent light bulbs - does that mean you can only use completely darkened rooms or have extremely expensive LED lights in the viewing room?)Products mentioned (I have no financial interest in any of these companies or their products):1.

Off, I still get this random error.  I have to manually go to panel brightness settings and the tv corrects itself without me having to actually change any settings-just going to the panel brightness menu in picture>pro settings>panel brightness menu fixes the issue.  This is one of the many minor issues that I have had with this tv.  Just 2 weeks ago, the tv would not show blu ray movies, despite using another panasonic product to play the Blu-ray Disc ( Bluray player is btt 490).  After about an hour of searching on the web, i was able to get it to work.  You actually have to unplug all power going into the tv and it will reset itself and play Bluray movies.  I was able to play Bluray before, but like the panel brightness issue, this happened randomly one day and would not fix itself unless I reset the tv.Despite having a great picture, the TV set fails in reliability. Given the opportunity to choose between this and the samsung 8500, I would probably go with the samsung, given its ability to support more aps like HBOgo and easier to navigate user interface. From what I hear the picture quality difference is only minor.If your're unloading $3000 on a tv, you should expect better reliability, especially from a Japanese manufacturer.  Consider panasonic's terrible customer service reputation on servicing defective products and the fact that they have fully discontinued their plasma tv line in 2014 before buying this tv.ORIGINAL POST: The picture quality on this television is superb, but I cannot get over the reflections of my dim lamps that register on the glass panel. I have owned 2 other plasma TV sets  in the past.  My first was a 42\" samsung in college, the second was a Panasonic GT25 neither of which produced the same level of reflectivity that this set produces. I purchased the 60 inch VT60, so it may be possible that I never noticed the reflections on my 42\" GT25 simply because it is much smaller.  I just want  to bring this concern to the attention of a potential buyer.As several others have noted, some VT60s have noisy fans. This is the same with mine.  I  noticed that my right fan (relative to viewer) is quiet, but my left fan produces a low tone that is sometimes noticeable even when my surround sound system is on.  So it seems like it's \"hit or miss\" on whether or not you have a quiet fan set.

That lasted a couple of days before I called Amazon back to return the TV and buy a Samsung. The Amazon rep suggested I try to work with Panasonic on a repair while Amazon tried to figure out why I got two TVs with the exact same problem.After speaking with Panasonic tech (waste of time) Amazon called me back a couple days later and offered to pick up my set, deliver a brand new replacement, and knock $400 off the cost of the warehouse deal set I had.

At the start, I was convinced that LCD was the way to go.  Not sure why exactly.  All my research and advice of videophile friends, colleagues and family caused me to consider getting a plasma instead.  It came down to the Samsung F8500 and the Panasonic ST.  After looking at them, a lot, side by side, I couldn't resist the VT.  The F8500 was nice, but the black levels just weren't deep enough to warrant getting a plasma.  They looked more like the LCDs to me.  The ST was nice too, but there was something about it that bothered me.  I couldn't put my finger on it.  Then a salesman at one of the stores I went to pointed it out to me.  The materials used to make the VT seem much nicer.  The casing and the screen itself look better.  There seemed to be less difference between the VT and ZT (which was just too much money for me), than between the ST and VT.  If you haven't seen the VT, I urge you to go look at it.  Mine is mounted in a room with 4 large windows that are covered by light filtering shades.  It's over my fireplace due to space issues.  I was very concerned that it wouldn't be bright enough during the daytime.  Luckily, it is more than bright enough.  Even with the shades up on a sunny day, I have no problem at all.  There are several picture modes.  I think mine is set now to 'Home Theater'.  It's brighter than some of the others.  There is a 'Bright Room' setting, but I don't need it.  The motion and contrast are so incredibly smooth and deep.  When watching an HD video, I honestly feel as though I could reach into the TV.  It's almost three dimensional.  I have had it now for a few months and no problems so far.  When the TV is off, I really notice the TV itself.  It looks very classy and high end.  A huge step up from my old LCD in every regard.  I was very sad to learn not only that the plasma market is hurting, but Panasonic is stopping production of plasma TVs.  I don't get it.  The amazing contrast and motion of plasmas make such a difference. Then again, I was all ready to buy an LCD before I discovered plasmas.

Instead, I'll focus on these four things:1. This is a set that deserves a good professional calibration, but in my experience, most of the technicians doing consumer-level calibrations don't really know how to get the best from today's TVs. Instead of hiring someone, consider getting the Spears & Munsil calibration DVD. It will help you get in the ballpark without spending a lot of money.2. Although the VT60's have terrific image quality, the audio quality isn't nearly as good. If you don't plan on hooking the TV into a full-blown home theater setup, you might want to pair it with one of the better sound bars.3. For some reason, the Panasonics are sensitive to line voltage, and power spikes will cause visible screen artifacts. If you want truly optimum performance, you might want a simple power conditioner ahead of the VT60. Also, like all plasma TVs, a lot of infrared radiation is emitted by the panel. You can feel it as heat if you put your fingers a few inches from the screen. It's mostly harmless, but it may cause a bit of interference with other IR remote controls you might have.4.If your room has a lot of ambient brightness, you might prefer the equivalent Samsung. Of course, if you can afford it, the newest OLED TVs from Samsung or LG (though I don't own the LG) are stunning.I also want to share a few lines about how terrific Amazon customer service is. I purchased the 55\" VT60 for my son as a Christmas gift in early December. Unfortunately, when he opened it, the screen was cracked. With nothing more than an email to Amazon's customer service team, he received a replacement unit in three days, and the broken one was carted away, no questions asked.

I am an audio and video lover and read a number of AV magazines like Sound and Vision.  Reading reports and looking at displays at Costco reinforced my intention to buy another plasma.  (I have great light control in my viewing room so the reflective glossy glass surface on a plasma is not an issue; picture quality is my only objective).Then Sound and Vision reviewed the VIERA TC-P60ST60 60\" in August, and called it gorgeous with deep blacks, high performance, and low cost (retail at $1499).  Deep blacks and details in shadows are a huge benefit of plasma displays and was the original reason I bought the 2007 Viera.  I wanted one.  Spending $1500 on another TV was not priority until Sound and Vision reported that Panasonic was exiting the plasma business in 2014.  They also reported that the current Panasonic plasmas are the best ever produced, rivaling the coveted title held by Pioneer in their expensive top of the line Kuro(s) back to 2009, but not produced anymore.  Other reviews compared the Panasonics to Kuro, and many came out on the side of Panasonic... wow that is something.I started looking more in earnest in December and discovered that the normal outlets were running low on inventory.  I attempted to purchase the TC-P60ST60 from Best Buy, but strangely the store, not 10 miles from my house, and with inventory, could not provide delivery in the online order.  Then they ignored my question and request for a response about delivery.  Buh bye BB.Now I am glad BB did not respond.  I never really thought about buying a TV here on Amazon, but started reading reviews on a number of sets while comparing prices.  It drove me to the Panasonic TC-P65VT60 65-Inch (the VT being an upgrade to the ST series).Why buy a 65\" inch instead of a 60\"?  Just look at the prices:  Still available the Panasonic VIERA TC-P60ST50 60\" is $2006 and the Panasonic VIERA TC-P65ST60 65-Inch is  $2800 here on Amazon from a third party. Even last years, Panasonic VIERA TC-P65VT50 is $3000 from a third party.  But the upgraded TC-P65VT60 is $2295 from Amazon.  For me, it was worth another $800 for a larger screen and the upgrade to a  VT over what I was originally going to purchase, especially considering the deep perceived discount on this set ($2295 vs $3000 from other places). As an Amazon Prime customer \"enhanced delivery\" including moving the TV into the house, unpacking it, and testing it were all free (more on that later).  Then there are all the glowing reviews here, along with a number saying \"get one while they are available\"... OK, OK, yes I know.  Buy now.Ordering was easy, with multiple confirmations including delivery date and time window.  The price was certainly right.The TV came last week.  Delivery was friendly, professional, and exactly as promised. In fact, the delivery agents called to ask if they could deliver earlier than the window... Oh yes of course you can! (Tip your agents if they do a good job!).Set up was simple.  The TV guides you through the process.  I really do not care about a lot of the bells and whistles--so no comments on facial recog, motion and/or voice controls.  I have bells and whistles on my Direct TV and Roku units for web based content (strongly preferring the Roku, and particularly Amazon video).  I was paying attention during start-up to the fan noise others have mentioned.  I heard the fan start in my quiet room and that was it, when the fan is up and running it makes no noticeable noise even in a quiet room. (same as my prior set that also had fans).I wanted to see the picture and watch a couple of things that were problematic on my prior set.  Notably the final 30 minutes of Joss Whedon's Cabin in the Woods which is very dark in a number of areas.  The TC-P65VT60 produced deep blacks, accurate colors, no after imaging during movement in dark sections (something my prior set struggled with) and clean transitions between light and dark background with no halos.  In short, quite an improvement and everything as expected.  Out of the box picture quality is simply stunning.Using a couple of reviewers suggestions on fine tuning a custom picture were very helpful and produced an unexpectedly improved picture.  I find myself using two modes, THX bright room and the custom setting about equally depending on day or night viewing.  (I do not like Vivid at all, it appears artificial).Viewing a number of sources including blue ray, Direct TV HD, and Roku HD content all showed great definition, and even being able to stand 2 feet from the set and still see high def without any apparent breakup (unlike my prior set, which needed to be viewed at least 5 feet back).  This is what 4K promises, the ability to be close and still see high def.  Well, Panasonic apparently has already done this without a 4K picture or $4K price.  My normal viewing position is about 7 feet and has been perfect for a 60-65\" display.I am very happy with this purchase and the service provided by Amazon.  Now, what are you waiting for?  Buy one while you can, for when they are gone, they are gone... and you will be left with the future of 1st gen and currently expensive OLED sets for similar picture quality to these Panasonic plasmas (tap your shoes three times chanting Kuro, Kuro, Kuro?).Quick update 01-16-2014:On HDMI and 3D.  Routing HDMI through an Onkyo TX-NR1007 proved that the 1.3 HDMI implemented on this receiver would not pass the proper 3D signal from a Blueray player to the TV. Plugging the HDMI directly into the TV works for the picture (and 3D), but not the digital surround sound.  The workaround?  The TV has an optical out!  Run the optical cable to the TX-NR1007 and select the proper input (on the receiver settings) for getting this sound signal.  Works perfectly!  In fact, for those that do not have any HDMI switches on their AV receiver,  and do have an optical IN, this set-up would allow you to have HDMI PQ and digital sound quality with an older receiver.One more note:  Be sure to catch Sound and Vision magazine for Feb/Mar 2014--not only do they have a highly complimentary eulogy for Panasonic plasma in the opening editorial (\"GET IT WHILE YOU CAN!\"), but Panasonic plasmas (ZT, VT, and ST series) make it into the 2013 Top Picks of the Year...along with the TC-P65ZT60 is the TOP PICK OF THE YEAR!", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Near Perfect TV", "Author": "Michael S Borrini", "ReviewID": "REYX14DCP4GDF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The quickest cure to fear of plasma is owning one.PQ is unrivaled (vt and zt) except for maybe Samsung8500, which is also a plasma.Black level is best in the gameNetwork features work nicely including dlna.Don't really use the other bells and whistles.

After reading CNET's review, I was leaning heavily toward the Panasonic VT-60.  Friends and family all were against my purchasing a plasma, saying LED is the only way to go, but none of them could tell me why.  My research told me differently, but I wanted to view it in person so, I went to Best Buy to take a look.  While there, a Samsung factory rep, who was very friendly, asked how he could help us.  My wife, still refusing to believe plasmas are any good, asked the rep if he could buy any 60\" TV under $2,000, what he would buy.  He stated, as long as the room isn't overly bright, without question, he would get a plasma.  He brought us over to see Samsung's plasma, which was right next to the VT-60.  When I asked him about the VT-60, he then told us that, although he hated to admit it, the Samsung doesn't come close to the Panasonic's picture, and it was obvious, looking at the 2 of them side to side.  That tipped the scales for me and I bought the VT-60.I've now had it for about a month and am fully satisfied.  Like most reviews state, the picture is incredible.  My room does have a bank of windows facing the TV, and there certainly is glare, but nothing the \"Cinema Bright Room\" setting can't handle.  Our windows do face north, which means there's very little direct sun.  I have 2 recliners which both allow me to view the TV at an angle, which eliminates the glare problem.  If seated on the couch directly in front of the TV, you do notice the glare, but closing the window's shutters pretty much reduces the glare to a minimum.  This is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars.  Since I never had an LED TV in that room, I'm not sure how it would handle the glare any differently.One note that I never read on any review.  You can't watch a 3-D Blue-ray movie unless your Blue-ray player has 3-D capability.  My Blue-ray player does not have it, and, unless there's something that I'm missing, the movies won't run in 3-D.  If anyone has a suggestion, I'd love to hear it.So far, I love the VT-60.  All my friends and family that questioned plasma's, now admit that I made a great decision.  I thought about looking into customized settings, but think the THX Cinema and THX Cinema Bright room settings create perfect pictures, for my taste.  I switch Bright room on during the day, and simply switch it back at night.

I suspect they are unable to scale the process to 4K. I really wants in the market for a TV as I had an older Panasonic plasma. But I cannot stand the uneven back light bleed in most LCDs, but the thing that really gets me is the blur. Everything just looks like a mess on an LCD when motion gets moving. I checked out a number of 4K LCDs before pulling the trigger to see if they were all they were cracked up to be. Yes the 4K TVs look pretty good on a still image but in other areas they still fell short. Not knowing how long we may need to wait for OLED to mature I decided to pull the trigger.In the end I am very pleased. Now I am no idiot who buys a plasma and then goes and screws it up, you need to know not to leave one image on and it helps to understand the tech you are working with. That said now days its so hard to burn them in for those that do it, it is usually no worse than the back light bleed on a LCD. So I operated my 5 year old Panasonic for all that time and had zero burn in or uneven ware. But right away I could tell the temporary image retention on the VT60 was better along with the other subtle image issues that plasmas have. Everything was just a strait up a big improvement.There are a TON of features on this TV. Unfortunately we don't use any of them because we hook a PC up to the TV so all the smart apps and so on done better on a PC. And of course the sound is the same, don't buy a TV this beautiful and ruin the experience with any built in speakers. I never even tried them.We wall mounted ours and it looks great, although it was more difficult to wall mount since it was so thin. None the less it went on to the same wall mount our last 54 inch was on without a problem.Now to nit pick on a couple details.I wish Panasonic had made the silver bezel liner removable. It does not fit with my d\u00e9cor I would have rather had all black.I also wish Panasonic would have allowed us to use USB to hook up the built in web cam to our PC, this way we could Skype on the PC without needing to get our own camera.In addition and this is more of a general TV complaint I wish that they would make the API to control the TV more open so that you could get other apps to control the TV. They have their own android app which is nice but everyone is sick of switching apps for every device. You need 1 app for your TV, 1 for your PC, 1 for you receiver, and in my case you need a Logitech app to control a couple items. I would prefer if they had a API that great apps like unified remote could tap into.  Also their is a couple fans on the back and if things are quiet you can hear them if close.

I bought the TV from Paul's TV and was quite satisfied with the experience.Anyway, now on to the TV. I didn't buy this TV for the camera, face recognition, voice commands, smart features, or other stuff. I bought it for the picture quality. I had an LG 60\" plasma before which was good but did not have great black levels. This TV's black levels blow the LG plasma's away. They are pretty awesome. To get better you'd probably have to 4x the price for a smaller 55\" OLED TV. That may change in the future but it's not the case today.The picture quality on the TV is so good that it brings out flaws that I haven't seen before in normal HDTV received by an antenna. I suppose that's good in a way, but also bad, because you notice the flaws more. Where this TV really shines is Blu-ray. It definitely has the best picture quality I've seen and the black levels really make a difference when watching in a dark room and simulating that movie theater experience. I'm using \"THX Cinema\" mode with \"Normal\" color temperature.I think it's important to note that this TV is best for viewing in a dark room. If you won't be primarily viewing in a dark room, then a brighter plasma like Samsung's high end plasma or even an LCD TV might be better. This plasma is not as bright as a typical LCD TV.Because this is an expensive TV and I've read some reviews about poor service experiences with Panasonic, the $100 Squaretrade warranty from Costco was a no-brainer.

They told me Friday was the earliest they could get here and to call Amazon with the issue. I spoke with Amazon and they paid CEVA an additional fee to deliver it on Wednesday. Customer service is always the best here, which is why I bought here despite reservations of such a large online purchase. The actual delivery went well. Two gentlemen arrived carried the TV upstairs and plugged it in to make sure it worked. Offered to take the box, I kept just in case there was an issue. They drew the line at helping hang it though. The bracket was already wall mounted bit they wouldn't place it on. Which I guess isn't overly surprising. Overall positive experience. Most importantly the TV is truly amazing. Being a plasma I am trying to be careful about static images, but I bought the tv to enjoy it. I play games, watch movies and tv shows with a station logo on it.

I researched for a long time before deciding to pick up this set.The picture is beautiful, sharp with nice colors and I love having deep dark black tones. I love how it saves your settings for different media ports. Like when I switch to my DVD player the settings revert back to whatever I had the settings at when I was last watching on that player. When I'm watching 3D the settings go back to whatever I had it set when I was watching 3D. I don't have to keep switching the settings every time I change the player.The reason I love that feature so much is that the picture is particularly fabulous for if you use the calibration settings from this site:[...]And those take a bit of time to set up, but it's totally worth it.The 3D is beautiful. Not quite as sharp as a computer screen, but nearly! I'm a real sucker for stereoscopic 3D hehe. Unfortunately not a whole lot of movies make the most of it at the moment. I own 20some 3D movies and oddly enough, Step Up 3D is the most 3D of them so far. Even just scenes where people are standing around talking you can really see big differences in their distances.Love being able to access Netflix and Amazon Instant Prime so easily directly through the TV rather than having to run a system at the same time.As someone else mentioned, with cutbacks, when the TV was delivered there was only one delivery man, but that didn't bother me.

Initially, I was looking at purchasing the ST60 series, but when I saw this TV go on sale for just a couple hundred more than the ST60, I decided to splurge and use the money I had planned on spending on speakers and go for the VT60 model. The colors are incredible and the black levels are outstanding. I've been watching a mix of Cable TV, streaming content, BluRay movies, and Blu-Ray 3-D, some Xbox 360 gaming and I'm continually impressed. The depth of the 3D is better than I had imagined, since I wasn't able to view this TV at any retail store. They all said they don't have them on display because of cost. Lame excuse, but with all the positive reviews I decided to make the purchase. Only negative I can think of on this is that I wish it had 4 HDMI ports instead of just the 3, but that's a minor issue.The touch remote is kinda goofy and I don't use the voice controls at all. The WiFi and Apps are very snappy and quick to respond and I like that I'm able to have multiple custom home screens. The built-in speakers are also quite good, though at some point I'm planning on getting a surround sound system so that the sound quality can match the picture quality. In the meantime, I'm content with the sound.Some folks have complained about fan noise, but I can hardly hear the fans, even with the volume muted. Unless, of course, you put your head behind the TV... but who watches TV from there?I've tweaked the picture settings based on a CNET review, but so far it looks very similar to the THX Cinema settings.As far as the 3-D glasses are concerned, the included pair have been used in watching two movies in addition to a more expensive and rechargeable Panasonic branded pair. I also purchased a $20 Samsung pair. Comparing each of them, they all seem to display the picture in the same quality, so it's just a matter of comfort. I have prescription glasses, so the Samsung 3-D glasses fit over my glasses better than the others.

I used Dnice settings with a few tweaks of my own and I could not be happier. Black levels were what I was after with this TV as that was the absolute weakness of our Sharp LCD. I was disappoint from day one with our Sharp's black levels before I was more educated on plasma vs LCD. The picture is just gorgeous and appeared to get better over time during the break in.I had to laugh at the review that said, unless you are trying to watch this TV on the beach in the sun, then you are crazy to think it is too dim in the daylight. I have to agree. We have a large 100\" picture window adjacent to the TV. In the day time, with the ground covered in snow and the sun shining, that is a bit much for reflection and brightness. However, we just shut the blinds and good to go. With no sun beating on the snow, or just regular sunlight during the day time, I have no issues with the brightness of this TV.We had one incidence of image retention when we left Netflix paused for an unknown amount of time on the THX Bright room setting. The \"Lost\" logo as well as the pause button was showing up on solid screens after I caught it. I ran Dnice slides all night and that reduced it greatly. Then over the next week it faded to nothing and you can not see it any longer. Phew..I have no review on 3d as we will likely never use it.

That is not the full story. You should take a look at the review online at CNET. CNET states there were only two TVs that performed better than the Panasonic PST60: the Panasonic VT60 and the Panasonic ZT60. The only reason the latter two TVs received a four star rating is because they were much more expensive than the PST60. The VT60 actually has deeper blacks and a better picture than the PST60. The ZT60 only performed better than the VT60 in a bright room in a side-by-side comparison. The list price of the VT60 is nearly double that of the PST60, and the ZT60 is even more. However, with the five star review of the PST60 and with the fact that Panasonic is no longer making Plasma TVs, the price on the PST60 has not dropped, and even sold out nearly everywhere you look. The VT60 price has dropped to just about $250 more than the PST60 at the time I purchased this TV. It was expensive, especially when compared to LEDs and LCDs, but it was well worth it.The TV set up was a snap. My family room is pretty bright and I have not purchased blackout panels yet for the window treatments. Nevertheless, the screen is bright and crisp and the colors are amazing.

There have been so many well-written reviews that it is difficult to compose a \"new\" one, so I hope that I don't borrow too much from what others have already said so well. I really, really love this TV, but I had a good idea of what I was getting before I purchased it from my previous Plasma experiences. So there weren't really any surprises.  But the different display technologies exist for a reason, and some viewers might be better off with LED instead. To determine if you fit that mold, you should carefully consider all of your TV viewing habits.The TV was delivered by Pilot carriers.  I was extremely anxious about purchasing something this big and expensive through Amazon.  I am happy to report all went well.  The carrier called several times to confirm delivery, and arrived when scheduled.  Two guys, so I did not have to help them. They asked me what else they could do, but I just wanted to be alone with my Plasma...... Some regrets there, as it took 3 of us weaklings to get it high up on the wall the next day.\"What's in the Box?\"..  Besides the huge and heavy TV, you get 2 remotes and 2 pairs of 3D glasses.  There is a stand that is massive and it is wasted since we mounted on the wall.  I am not too excited with the remotes- I really believe the big one should be a universal, to help with the clutter. It's your average remote, very similar layout to the Samsung we have.  The second one is a stubby little limited function remote to be used to navigate the smart features.  It has a track pad like a laptop. Both work OK.  The camera is mounted at the very top of the display, and based on where I have the TV mounted, probably will not see much use since there is a limited range of adjustment angle.  Likewise most of the \"built-in\" \"Smart\" features; mostly this is a vehicle to watch films as they were intended to be watched.\"The Experience\"...  This is a big, beautiful display.  But it may underwhelm you at first; A few adjustments to the picture, getting the viewing angle the way you want it, changing a few things around in the room to reduce reflections or incoming light, getting the right program material, maybe even breaking it in for a few hundred hours, but eventually it will hit you like a bolt of plasma lightning.  Visitors to our living room gawk and move around the room without taking their eyes off of it. All of the Plasmas I have owned exhibit what I would describe as a subtle brilliance, and it might take some watching before you can appreciate just how good the picture is. I can also see how the transition from LED/LCD to Plasma might be difficult for some; they are different animals and it could take some getting used to- especially regarding contrast and brightness.My biggest complaint is the fan noise others have mentioned. On my set, the one on the left side of the screen makes a sound similar to a distant, howling wind while it is spinning up at power-on. My solution is to turn up the surround sound.  It doesn't really bother me because I know what is making the noise, but I can see how this might be annoying in certain settings.\"Calibration\"......Before I purchased, I wondered why in the world anyone would pay to have their TV adjusted.  Now I realize that there is an overwhelming myriad of adjustments to make, and getting one or more incorrect will cascade into a bunch of mis-adjustments.  However, having said that, I am not going to pay to have a professional calibration; for now I have duplicated some of the readily available published settings, and I will experiment from there, and eventually I think it would be an interesting project to learn to do the calibration myself.  But overall, the picture is so good that I think most folks will be pleased with it right out of the box, and with a few conservative adjustments it will get even better.  The real reason I don't consider a calibration to be a priority is because of the variations in the quality of programming material; you have different resolutions, formats, lighting techniques, etc, all of which make for a different look.  The person who watches a lot of sports may well end up with different adjustments than someone who likes movies.  And this preference might stray from a perfectly linear calibration, but hey, it's your TV.\"Break-in and Burn-in\" ..... I don't really know how to interpret much of what I read prior to the purchase of this set (It almost stopped me from purchasing this TV).  As far as breaking it in, I did the same with this one as I did with my previous Samsungs (both still in use today); I just back off on the intensities and go with a slightly dim and soft picture for a period of time, usually about 2 weeks, and then I go back and adjust to my preferences. It is unfortunate that the manufacturers do not provide more information about how best to optimize performance, so sadly we are all left with the various internet recommendations, many of which (including mine) might be nothing more than Voodoo ritual.  My own opinion is that with Plasmas the picture does improve with time.  I have absolutely no objective information to back that up; I just watch it and it gets better and better. Since I believe that it improves with time, then it follows logically that there is a break-in interval, which for me involves some common sense and a little TLC (not the channel!!).  Regarding Image Retention, Burn-in, etc, I have not experienced such, but I do believe those reviewers who say it happened.  What has me wondering is that it seems like in most cases that it happens right away; this leads me back to the \"Break-In\" theory.  If driving the phosphors hard produces sufficient heat to cause the phosphors to \"burn\" permanently, then could it be that the new screen phosphors in a brand new TV tend to run on the hot side for a while before settling in to a more even operation?  The common threads seem to be gaming, stationary images for extended periods, and (I think) Brightness/Contrast/Luminance adjustments.  So my theory is to avoid non-moving images, keep away from certain channel logos when possible, always use a full screen image (no black bars), and don't run all of your intensity adjustments right to the rails.  Being an old CRT guy, I am very familiar with burned-in images, and this problem has been around in one form or another since the inception of television.  But since I am not an expert in Plasma Technology, I am not qualified to judge what others may have done to cause or prevent this.  The experts make a clear distinction between \"Image Retention\" and \"Burn-In\", yet to me they are inseparable, and I do not understand how you could end up with a permanent image without starting with a temporary one. Unfortunately, since the technology is going away (just like the Cathode Ray Tube), we may never have answers to these questions.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Incredible picture", "Author": "Keith", "ReviewID": "RCG6JZ6BQMOBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The price dropped nearly $500 just before Christmas from Amazon, so I decided it was a great time to get my dream TV.

After selecting the \"vivid\" picture setting the contrast across all colors blows the LED tv out of the water and it only seems to be getting better with time.  At this price point it is hard to beat this model in pure performance.  I only hope enough positive reviews surface that Panasonic decides to continue Plasma production.  I will probably pick up one more of these before they all disappear until OLED comes down to this price point.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sanus LT25 is a good wall mount", "Author": "Pluma", "ReviewID": "R1A544PEGUKQRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV, what's not to like?

Excellent uniformity, off-angle viewing (although once you get close to 180 degrees you get a 3d-esque blur), and it doesn't seem to run as hot as other plasmas I've owned. Got this at the lowest price ever on Amazon, and they were 5 stars as usual. The delivery guys were another matter, but that's YMMV.Cons: They don't make a bigger one. 65\" isn't so astounding from more than 12 feet away. 3d is still largely a gimmick, but economies of scale mean you don't pay much for the feature. 'Home' menu on bootup is annoying and makes for Harmony remote challenges, (disable-able) advertisements in your TV's interface are criminal. Watching LCD's at other people's houses is now no-fun as skin tones look unpalatable on any other TV.Great TV, great price, and a technology sadly killed off mainly by LCD marketing.

I've had my P55VT60 and it already suffers from image burn \"SKYNEWS HD\" to be exact.  I would watch SkyNews perhaps for an hour every couple of days then the other day I noticed their faint logo, top left and bottom left on every thing I watch, grrr image burn!!!!Call me a conspiracy theorist if you like but I think SKY have intentionally bright and intense logos just to keep their logo on your plasma at all times.  I watch BBC world service and the whole BPL matches without any problems with their static logos.I really should have paid more attention to conditioning the screen in it's early days and run on cinema mode for the first few hundred hours. Instead I used THX cinema which may have contributed to this.Note to SKYNEWS - tone down that logo or even shift it around a bit, could see a class action coming your way if this is common fault!After note: I think I read in the literature somewhere that these Panasonics automatically run in a subdued mode for the first few hundred hours to prevent exactly this problem, guess mine didn't..Be warned then, condition these (and any other plasmas) carefully.

If you're looking for some cons to dissuade you from purchasing this TV, you probably won't find them in this review.I don't even know where to begin with this TV.  The picture?  The Apps?  The Bezel?  This TV is just all around awesome.  I'm just so glad I was able to get one before it was discontinued.Picture -The picture on this TV is incredible.  Deep blacks, bright white and colors, it's just a joy to watch.  I've gotten so many compliments from friends and family who are floored by the picture.  I think i'm one of the few who like 3D and this TV does it amazingly well.  I can't wait for baseball season to start.  Watching the Tampa Bay Rays win the 2014 World Series on this TV is going to be such a pleasure.Apps -This TV has a number of apps, each with varying degrees of usefulness (mildly useful to extremely useful).  Of course you have your staples, Amazon Prime Video, NetFlix, and Hulu Plus.  Each of these are easy to use and work extremely well.  There are media player and DLNA server apps that enable you to view/listen to pics, music, or videos on your local PC.  These work well and i've gotten a ton of use out of them in the first few months that I've had the TV.  Other (less useful apps in my opinion) apps include Facebook, Twitter, Weather, a web browser and various games.  As far as I can tell, you can't keep any of these apps open while you watch TV which saps their usefulness for me.  It would have been nicer if you could scroll through your Facebook/Twitter feed in a sidebar while watching TV, but this is nothing but the most minor of inconveniences.  The web browser is surprisingly full featured but I can't find a way to make it full screen.  There's a sidebar on the left of the screen that can't be closed, which I found really strange.  There's also a Skype app that you can use along with the built in camera.  We used it once to show my brother in law our new baby and it's a really cool feature.  I could see us using that more often.Conclusion -This is one heck of a TV.  It's sharp looking, has an amazing picture, and has some pretty cool apps.  It's too bad it was discontinued, although that's probably the reason I was able to snag it at such a ridiculous price ($1600).

It is just stunning, buttery smooth, lifelike, sharp, and just plain beautiful.  Sometimes the blacks get so deep that they blend in perfectly with the bezel and you can't distinguish one from the other, but without sacrificing shadow detail where desired.  I purchased from Best Buy (sorry Amazon) for $1519 on a price-match from Abe's of Maine.  I initially used the THX Bright Room setting based on comments in other reviews, but then switched to Custom with a few tweaks of my own.  Don't be afraid to use the Custom setting as your baseline, as Panasonic obviously has certain parameters pre-set for you within that mode.  The picture is plenty bright enough, anyone hesitating about that should not.  I have watched movies, sports, news programs, Netflix, Breaking Bad marathon on AMC, etc. and eveything is just gorgeous.  I cannot imagine getting more out of a TV than this.  Regarding the fans, yes, I can hear them if I listen for them, and I am sitting about 10 feet from the TV, but they are not loud enough to detract from my enjoyment.  I live in a crappy climate so it seems either my furnace is running or my A/C is, and either of them is plenty enough to blot out the fan noise anyway.  Again, you will not regret your choice.

I actually bought the VT30 first and returned it, because the colors on that model weren't very good in my opinion, VT30 had the deeper blacks, but that's not all that matters to me. The Samsung was way better between those two models for my taste, and I have been happy thus far, but I wanted another Flagship TV for my Basement/Man Cave, as well as having one in my living room, and with hearing of the new VT60 and F8500 being the best TV PQ ever It got me curious.Cyber Monday had a 250 dollar price drop and I was able to get the VT60 for 1749.00 so I pulled the trigger and purchased it. I really was considering the Samsung Plasma F8500 series, due to the what I experienced in 2011, and with a lot time put into reading professional reviews, but their price was 2300 and that was a little over what I wanted to spend. Now if the Samsung F8500 was around the same price, I might have been posting a review on that TV because I like having the brighter whites and brighter Picture in general, being it has been reviewed being even more improved, and with their black levels actually competing with the VT60. However, I'm glad that I didn't and went with the VT60 as I read the Samsung has very bad input lag for gaming, and that was a factor for me with my new TV. The VT60 has a lot lower input lag which really what it came down to, along with the price.As stated on different forums, IT IS TRUE with aging this TV gets better in PQ, I am very impressed in how much the Quality has went up over the last 500 hours and improved it's PQ from the start, and it was nice from the start, but I didn't experience anything spectacular as was being stated by countless reviews. I do now, although my biggest gripe is it still doesn't have the bright whites as I hoped for. Samsung seemed to have the upper hand between the 2 plasmas since 2011, and still seems to be the case. However, the VT60 blacks are indeed excellent, the colors are very accurate/perfect, and as far as the overall PQ and 2D/3D performance, it triumph's my current Samsung. I will say the color accuracy isn't a whole lot better than my D7000,(however VT60's are \"little\" better)which is probably due to the deeper black levels as they say what makes those colors and PQ so life like and pop. I do notice a huge difference over my Samsung as far as having those \"Inky Blacks\" (term that is commonly used) and the shadow detail on the VT is excellent as well, I never really understood what it really does until I saw tried viewing some scenes recommended by CNET and my Samsung D7000 doesn't even compare. I do like to game which is why lower input lag was a must for me. I game on the Xbox 360 and now the Xbox One with mostly COD and now Killer Instinct and the VT has very nice graphics/gameplay and gaming lag is not a problem on the VT60. I also notice a difference of less lag than my current Samsung which is what I obviously used before and my gaming will be on the VT60 only from now on. I don't understand only having the 3 Hdmi inputs over the usual 4, but really in this day and age, we all use a Home Theater Surround Setup anyways, so not a big deal really.I am still debating on putting this upstairs and moving my Samsung to downstairs, because of the improved overall PQ over my current D7000, but hear that it is not as great in a room with windows, therefore I can't comment on that as of yet, for now I am going to just leave it in the basement. Besides If you want to watch any 3D it needs to be dark to enjoy the full experience and that is where the VT really shine's as well with 2D and any content for that matter. Since I'm able to accomplish a dark environment any time of the day in my basement, that will probably be it's location. The Smart Viera APP interface is easy to navigate with any APP you could possibly want. Sound is very good for a slim TV and the wireless built in setup was a breeze to connect to my router. The web browser was not the greatest, but I use my laptop and run an HDMI cable to the TV and I can browse anything on a 60\" screen with the performance and speed of my laptop. Pictures can be viewed easily using different external storage devices as well.For adjusting picture settings I adjusted them at 120 hours, being a lot of forums say to watch it with low contrast and no static images just to be safe of Image Retention for the first 100 hours. I used the D Nice settings on the Control Cal forum under the Custom mode. I did try the CNET settings, but they didn't go into great depth on all the settings that could be used as they usually do, but I also noticed it wasn't performed by David Katzmaier, as he is the guy that usually reviews the top TV's, and it appears he did the review on the ZT series instead. Now I did use the ZT settings and applied those to this one in the Cinema setting, after all they basically have the same picture quality. That way you can flip between the both to see what you like(each one will have a better or different PQ on different movies). However I found the custom mode for DNice settings are excellent, and the THX preset really are great as well with a little tweaking to your liking especially for those who don't want to mess with all the picture setting parameters and don't want to spend for a professional calibration. I personally DO NOT care for the Warm 2 setting, as it makes the whites dingy, and the blues appear grayish, and gives everything a khaki kind of look, so with the D NICE and CNET settings I use the Cool 1 or Normal color temperature, and for the THX or even Home Theater mode I use the Warm 1 or the Normal color temp. and that will give you those more vivid colors and brighter whites. It only really affects the skin tones, but they are not bad depending on what you are watching[A movie with more outside scenes with blue skies and a lot of whites or brighter colors look better in those Cooler Temps in my opinion]. If you really want that brighter Picture as some say can't be achieved, just use the same settings as say CNET, D-NICE settings and use a 2.0 or 1.8 gamma, turn up the contrast to 95-100 and use the Resolution Remaster and the Brilliance Enhancer options and set them to strong along with the Brightness at around 8-12, again with the color temperature on Cool 1 or Normal. I even put the panel brightness to high sometimes and it looks even better depending on the content you are watching. I also recommend trying the motion smoother on Weak. I was never of fan of the Soap Opera Effect but it does wonders on this TV at the Weak setting.Bottom line if your able to get this TV in a 60 inch for under 2000, 55 inch for the 1499, or the 65 for around the 2000, I would go for it, as you will not find a better TV with the PQ, Features, 3D performance, etc., than anything else out there. Even at the current prices(although they will drop again I'm sure)you will be happy with your purchase. After all, IT is considered the new \"Reference Model\" with the exception of the ZT which is only better in a bright room, but then again the ZT lacks the on board camera, and sound quality compared to the VT.P.S. It's getting annoying with most new movies coming out in the format with the top and bottoms cut down in the wide screen format, I mean we don't buy these big TV's to experience a big downsize on our screen. I found if you change the screen format and use the HD Side Cut Zoom option, then use the additional Zoom option and adjust it from the 15 to about 8-10 and use the up/down arrows do adjust the space equal for the top/bottom and in a dark room, you can't notice the extra cropped screen, due to the deep blacks and the bezel being black it appears as the old VT30 that had the thicker bezel and is a great compromise without distorting the Picture too bad.(The more you zoom the more it gets out of focus)  I have a couple photos on my profile to show how it looks using the Zoom option.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "AWSOME", "Author": "Larry Umbaugh", "ReviewID": "R3RKHZCMG65FT7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS:  This TV is AWSOME.

I do hate to give a 3-star review to such a remarkable picture, but alas, I am forced to. As many have mentioned (and I won't go into detail here), this picture is the best picture on a television that I have ever seen. It really is a shame that Panasonic is getting out of the plasma business.That being said, I am on my second set, and I have found the buzzing noise to be worse than the first. In short, if you watch action movies, and movies where there is always extensive ambient background sounds, then this tv will probably work great for you.However, if you also watch dramas, then you may very well notice the mechanics of the set. When I was doing my testing, there were many movie scenes where the tv fan noise and buzzing were prominently heard, and thus, drew you \"out of\" the movie. The movies I significantly noticed it on were the following: the beginning of Argo (white slides with voice commentary); Pride & Prejudice (several scenes of pure dialogue); Dan in Real Life (several scenes of pure dialogue); Toy Story III (several bright scenes); I even heard it while watching Cinderella with my little girls last night in spite of the fact that that movie has extensive ambient noise.Perhaps it is the two that I purchased; I have a relative that purchased the 55\" version and the noise coming from the set is much more subdued. Another relative has a GT, and I never noticed the fan noise (don't know if there is a fan on the GT version) or buzzing.So, in summary, if your hearing is acute, and you don't mind hearing the mechanics of the television in 'quieter/brighter' scenes, then go for it.As a note: I sat approximately 10-12 feet from the set with a dedicated in wall sound system.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for movies, so/so for television", "Author": "argiope", "ReviewID": "R220OFHVBFJ5CA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for movies, because plasma doesn't have the motion problems that LCD has with fast action.

Dont let the IR scare you !! I will still have this TV over any LED / LCD or even a UHD 4K one. The performance in fully dark environment is spectacular. 3D performance is very good too ( I personally dont watch a lot of 3D movies ). Even DVD movies look good. all in all... ignore the IR / burn in naysayers. Too bad Panasonic stopped making these sets. wouldve loved to see another iteration of plasma's from them.

With just a little bit of calibration the colors come close to my pro grade monitors. The units only drawback is its phobia of light, even the smallest light source will cause a glare on the screen or simply take away from the deep blacks. If you intend to watch this unit critically a dedicated room is advised. If you can get a room dark though is when this TV will blow you away the blacks are simply unmatchable.Watching a film with bars it is impossible to tell where a dark scene ends and the bars begin. Dark scenes will no longer distract with back-light bleed but draw you in and let you forget it is a screen. Some side notes of interest. This unit will work fine for games I had no problem playing the latest tomb raider (plenty of button mashing action parts). The key is to set the input to game and then assign it as a pc input.

These settings combine a bright screen, deep colors, excellent shadow detail and preservation of inky blacks. I compared them with the CNET recommended setting from their recently published VT60 review and found these to be a significant improvement...at least for me. I share them with you and any brand new owner as at least a good starting point to get the most out of this amazing set.THX Bright RoomContrast: 85Brightness: -5Color: 48Tint: 0Sharpness: 47Color Temperature: NormalVivid Color: OnColor Remaster: N.A.Photo Enhancement: N.A.CATS: OffVideo NR: LowMPEG Remaster: OffResolution Remaster: OffCaption Smoother: OffBrilliance Enhancer: MediumMotion Smoother: Off{Edit 5-4-13:  So now I've had the set for several days and I've had more of a chance to play with settings and fine tune things a bit. A couple of things have become apparent. The THX Cinema setting is the clear winner. The TXX Bright Room setting degrades the whites a bit and also very slightly washes out the set's color presentation. The Custom setting is nice but it seems to introduce a bit too much sharpness and overly boosted contrast making for a bit of a 'jaggies' effect that can only be partially tamed by backing down these specific settings. Within the THX Cinema setting I have brightness boosted ever so slightly and sharpness dialed back a tiny amount. And the color balence is set to \"neutral\" as this provides for the purest whites. You could go with 'warm 1' which is pretty nice but I'd stay away from 'cool 1 & 2' as it makes things too blue looking. So with these settings the picture is plenty bright even during the daytime in a well lit room and the colors are deep and saturated without looking artificially boosted. With the right source material (much of broadcast television, even programming that's described as \"HD,\" is simp;ly awful...try a blu-ray or the Discovery channel HD as they do a particularly good job) this TV simply sparkles.I tried like heck to love the built-in speakers but try as I might the truth is they simply suck. They are barely OK for the spoken word but they are simply pathetic for any kind of music whatsoever. I put on a Queen blu-ray disc and the great Freddie Mercury sounded like he had laryngitis. My wife wouldn't tolerate a true HT rig so I searched for a soundbar/pedestal speaker solution and came up with the ZVOX 555 (http://www.amazon.com/ZVOX-555-Low-Profile-Single-Cabinet-Surround/dp/B0055FZIZW). The perfect solution. The sound is night and day better than the built-in speakers and it fits in perfectly on my TV stand unit so that it becomes invisible from a visual POV. Is it as good as a true HT set-up? No. But it can get very loud without any signs of strain and it has useable bass down to about 45-50 Hz. Voices are extremely clear and it seems quite well constructed. Set-up was a breeze. One optical cable from the TV to the back of the ZVOX and you're done.Another Panasonic oddity. Holy crap! Just got off the phone with Panasonic Technical support and guess what? THERE IS NO WAY TO DISABLE THE INTERNAL SPEAKERS when using an external HT setup or soundbar!!! This option did exist in the VT50 but curiously does not in the VT60. Say what??? I'd guess that 90% of purchasers are not going to want to use the internal speakers and will, instead, be using some external speaker setup. And they're going to want to disable the set's internal speakers. Newsflash: it ain't going to happen. Not without a software patch at least. The tech representative said they are \"aware\" of the issue and are \"working on a fix.\" Bizarre that this is an option which existed in the outgoing 50 series units but was deleted in the 2013 60's.]Got my 55\" VT60 this morning and, as you can imagine I've been familiarizing myself with it all day. First off, having briefly owned the F8500 I can say that the vertical viewing angle issues I noted with the F8500 are much less pronounced with the VT60. With bright adjacent light sources there is a bit of reflectivity to the screen but nothing that's really distracting or which can't be ameliorated by shielding the TV from the light. With a set this revealing I've also begun to recognize how source dependant these TV's are. Regrettably, most broadcast TV leaves a great deal to be desired and this set will reveal all the inherent flaws of whatever its fed. I have FIOS fiber optic service, the best in the business, so it's not a limitation of the signal the TV is receiving...it's just generally lousy programming even if it's nominally labeled \"HD.\" However, when fed with a great source, this TV is really superb. As so many others have noted the level of detail in dark areas is unparalleled and the blacks really couldn't be a lot blacker. Colors are really stunning and they are richly saturated and 'dimensional' (a quality that makes a 2-D set look almost 3-D) I am using the set with largely OOTB settings though I did tweak them just a bit. My screen setting is THX Bright Room which I find terrific for general viewing and more than bright enough in a pretty well lit room during the day. As you go through the presets it's the second brightest, below, of course, the dreadful \"Dynamic\" mode (or whatever they call their torch mode). After reading another post above about the glass not being perfectly flat I looked at mine very carefully and it looks absolutely and completely flat with no concave or convex issues whatsoever. The THX Bright Room mode comes with the color temperature pre-set to Warm 2. I played with this several times and found that this was too aggressive and that either Warm 1 or neutral was better (I'm still going between those two and cannot yet make up my mind). The built-in speakers are considerably better than those on the F8500 and while still not even as good as the most pedestriam HT system, are serviceable and do a decent job reproducing music. I'd say the bass goes down to about 100Hz. Kick drums are clearly audible and have at least a little punch. Highs are rolled off but there's an equalizer that allows you to boost frequencies above 5000Hz that help add at least a tiny bit of sparkle. Haven't yet had a chance to test out the 3-D of the set. I did try to watch a 10 minute \"The making of a scene in Avatar\" 3-D promo clip that was available on Amazon for free. It was not terribly impressive but I have a couple of 3-D movies on their way to me so I'll be in a better position to report on that in a few days. The TV does run hot but I haven't heard any fan noise or buzzing whatsoever. Whites appear to be OK though I suspect that they are better on other sets, especially LED/LCD's. Not having the opportunity to directly compare sets 1:1 in my den I can't comment on the white other than to say that they were not a source of concern. Overall brightness is fine though I would definitely avoid some of the darker preset screen modes. One unrelated oddity. The four little clips that are used for cable management behind the (beautiful) silver triangle base were missing. I didn't realize this until the guys who had delivered the set and set it up had left. I called Panasonic expecting that they would be only too happy to send out replacements (after all, these things probably cost them maybe $1.50 each). I was not very happy as they told me I had to fax them a written request with a copy of my invoice. Really??? I just spent over two grand and these guys want to bust my shoes rather than doing the right thing and just sending them out? Bad move Panny! I did fax them what they requested so now we'll see if they step up to the plate. Sorry for rambling. Just wanted top provide some initial feedback. I will update this review as I become more familiar with the set.

Set-up was a breeze, although I rejected the \"normal\" picture setting as too dull.  There are several other options that really make the picture \"pop\" the way it is shown in the ads.  Panasonic's \"Smart TV\" features are terrific, especially the built-in Wi-Fi links and 3 HDMI inputs, which unclutter the table top (goodbye Roku box and HDMI switch) and provide LAN access to photos stored on my PC.  The SD card slot and USB port are also valuable.  The only negative, so far, is the little pop-up commercials that appear when changing the volume setting.  Why would Panasonic do this to their customers? (CORRECTION: Thanks to a helpful Amazon customer who replied to my original review, I'm rid of these annoying ads.  Just hit MENU, then SETUP, choose DISPLAY, then go to Smart VIERA Banner and switch if OFF.)  Also, the sound quality is good, but not great.  I was going to replace my DVD player with a Blu-Ray player anyway, so I opted for the Panasonic Home Theatre with 3-D Blu-Ray player (SC-BTT 190).  Big improvement in sound quality.  The two units work well together via an HDMI link.  Frankly, haven't taken the wrap off the 3-D glasses yet.  That feature did not factor into our selection of this set, but one of these days when something worth watching in 3-D comes along, we'll give it a try.

Panasonic makes some of the best TVs out there I was replacing the Sharp LCD TV that I owned for a few years.  The picture quality is top notch and if you don't want to give up an arm and a leg and your first born for the OLEDs this is the best option.  Great for watching movies as the THX Cinema setting is great, especially for watching 3D movies.  Black levels are awesome and the color quality pops off the screen.  I recommend having this TV professionally calibrated if you can to bring out the absolute best quality and you'll be very impressed as I was.  The speakers on this set are better than most and that's saying something for flat screen TVs and is OK for normal TV viewing like talk shows and news and kids programming.  For movie and sport viewing, I would recommend getting a good sound bar system or speaker system.  The Smart TV is functional with very good apps.  Just with Panasonic would have a deal with HBO to have their app on it, that's the only drawback with the Smart TV Apps.  This does have a built in camera for Skype and face recognition and a touch remote with voice recognition, but those are kind of gimmicky and I really have found a real functional use for it.  Some would view the 3 HDMI ports as being too few, but some many products that you tend to hook up to your TV nowadays (XBOX One) allow you hook up all your electronics to it and then run one HDMI cord to your TV.This is a definite must buy if you can afford it right now.

I've tried the Pixel Protector DVD using the Snow screen wash was but so far no luck in getting rid of the burn in or image retention.I will continue to try washing for a few more days in hopes of at least getting it to fade somewhat.The only thing I can hope for now is for the TV to just fail completely and claim it under warranty since Panasonic does not cover burn in at all.

Hopefully somewhere in the next 3 years the TV will have something go wrong that I can claim under warranty (yes I bought the extended warranty from square trade).I should have purchased an LED I suppose and not have the burn in issue but the LED's just don't produce the dark colors as well as the Plasma's do.

It wasn't a bad TV at all. But the 55\" Panasonic VT60 just blows it away in terms of sheer picture quality. I love deep blacks in a TV picture, and the blacks in this set are inky indeed. There's also no light bleeding, unlike the Samsung, and off axis viewing is impressive. The way it renders tonal gradations is silky smooth. My Samsung would often exhibit banding in gradients. The VT60 has shown little to no banding. 3D also looks terrific.There are a couple of downsides, however, which I think would apply to any plasma display and not just this one. I have the TV hooked up to my home entertainment system, which includes, among other things, a media center PC. So the TV acts like a big monitor for it. When it's just showing the PC's desktop, the picture is a little soft and the contrast is low. There's also a tiny amount of flicker. However, there's zero flicker when I'm watching movies or cable TV. The contrast is also a lot snappier.

Both Amazon and Ceva reps I talked to acknowledged that Ceva is having trouble making deliveries on time. Trying to communicate with them is also a nightmare, lots of trouble getting through on the phone. No one calls to say they will be late, or completely miss delivering. For me, they completely missed the original delivery date without contacting me. Then they missed the delivery time window on the date I called to schedule with them. Then they were a complete no-show on Christmas Eve, when I waited all day for what was supposed to be a 10-2pm delivery window. So I rescheduled again and finally got my TV 3 days later. Of course the driver showed up by himself and asked for my help carrying it in! So much for special delivery. What happens when they show up to a house and the person can't help carry one of these? Is Ceva accepting more business than they can handle? Does Amazon lack other delivery options for the Denver area? Ahh.

I compared this with the Samsung 8000, though that was LED. I thought the Panasonic was a better choice for few reasons.. One. Panasonic allows for more color calibration than Samsung. Though, the F series Samsungs do offer more choices in color adjustments. But whatever others say, Plasma is plasma,, and the warm color, preciseness of picture that it offers- its simply not there with LED/LCD. I saw Life of Pie on both TVs,, and no doubt Panasonic is the best.  Maybe I am also biased due to my 6 year old other panasonic is live and kicking!!However, the VIVID option is too bright but probably would be a good starting point for calibration. The THX Bright Room was the other one I used and it was perfect for movie watching.The apps are also good, I had the pen for few days but once I mounted it, I thought it became useless..and so was the video camera for skype. However, you can see the other party very well. The microphone was also superb. The side could hear me very well when I was 15 feet away from the tv. I didnt have to scream!!Streaming on Amazon Prime was one my 'Prime' Motivation to get this TV. the streaming was flawless.  And you simply can't tell, that it was streaming vs a Blue Ray player. Sound quality of the TV is also great,, almost like any other Center speaker!! However, I do have mine connected with BW, SpeakerCraft, Klipsch, Yamaha + Polk Audio Subwoofer.. But if you dont have the Optic cable connected with your receiver, it aint so bad, seriously!!All in all,  I think for 2013 models,, this was the ONLY buy available if you are into the Plasma and ' Its still is a TV and picture-quality  first ' camp... I would've gone for the Sony 4K XBR but I dont know how many movies would be available in 4K and it was still Pre-sales and I was most certain the price would drop for sure than 7K+tax.

There already already a hundred reviews here about that and a thousand posts on avsforums of people blathering on about blacks and contrast and so on.  There is really nothing more to add to that discussion.So what isn't good about this TV.It buzzes.  Plasmas do this.  I do not hear the fan noise, either Panasonic's fix has worked or my panel is one of the good ones.  But it does buzz, the brighter the scene the louder the buzz.  Normally the tv sound is enough to drown it out but during quite passages it is annoying.There is no program guide.  At all.  My $30 digital converter box from coupon program years back can show \"now/next\" and a program description.  This TV can't even do that!  You get the title of the current program and that's it.  It doesn't provide when the current show began or ends.  No description.  Not what's on next.  Not the full 2+ days that's usually available in the EPG data provided by the TV station.  I think that's pretty pathetic.  Not everyone uses a cable box with its own program guide.The media player is very limited.  I've only found a few video and audio formats it can play.  If you have an hours long mp3, it takes a very long time for the player to open it and start playing.The picture viewer is also limited and can only display jpg files.  It can't display progressive jpgs.  You can't zoom in.Only storage devices formatted to FAT seem to work correctly.  NTFS will sort of work and list files, but almost all of them will be unviewable or corrupted.You can not turn off the TV's speakers when using the optical out to a receiver.  You must lower the volume down to zero.  If you use HDMI ARC then apparently there is an option that will appear in the viera link app to turn off the TV's speakers, but it doesn't exist unless you have an HDMI ARC connection.The HDMI port can't power a Chromecast.

The only issue I have, and I mean the only issue, is that even at 600hz, when people move quickly, there is still a blur of mirrors surrounding the person or object.  its only for a fraction of a second, but it is noticeable.I will say though, this TV will ruin your best shows because of its clarity.  Sometimes people look like they are performing the movie \"live\" or appear to be on a set, because you can distinguish things so much better.  However, I believe movies will get better now that they know people can see more of the \"warts\" on a movie.  It will force producers to get better at what they do.*****Updated to my initial post******This is an updated review now that I have had the Panasonic VT60 for a few weeks now.  I would still rate it 4 stars, however there are a few things I would update potential buyers about.#1 - The \"mirror\" blur I mentioned in my initial post can be diminished or stopped all together if you turn off  or reduce \"Motion Smoother\" to \"Weak.\"  Weak setting seems to be the best of both worlds.  If I had known this initially, I would not have reduced the stars of this product.However, the following are \"Warnings\" if you decide to purchase this product:#2 - Extremely sensitive to Image retention AND Burn-in.  10 minutes straight on a fixed image is enough to cause severe image retention and 20 minutes will cause what seems to be permanent burn-in.  I had a Samsung Plasma HP-S5053 for 7 years and it has never had burn in from logos from TV stations.  It has had some image retention that was easily remedied with the wipe features of the tv.  I am going on its 8th year and it is just now starting to have significant enough phosphor deterioration (or whatever the plasma stuff is called) to be noticeable on a white screen in the lower right hand corner where all the logos go.  It still isn't noticeable in viewing, only when performing an \"All White\" protection.  However, after just a couple of weeks of using the panasonic, I have burn-in.  Really Burn in?  Unbelievable.  I treated this TV like a brand new baby.  Very little use, broke it in with 200 hrs before starting to use the TV normally.I have gamed on the TV, NBA 2k14 for PS4 and its quality is ridiculous.  However, a 6 minute gaming quarter of basketball creates image retention you will have to deal with if you don't want burn-in.  What a pain.I heard some people recommend 400 hrs of break in if you want to game.  400 hrs, seriously?  Say that out loud.  That isn't in the manufactures instructions.  Also, picture quality significantly dropped after 200 hrs, can't imagine what 400 hrs of break in would do.Because of the magnificent brilliance of the picture of this TV (Best I've ever seen) when you first run it, if you break it in with 200 hrs, there is a significant reduction in picture quality.  Very sad.  The shows don't look nearly as great as they use to be.  Looks more like my Samsung than I would like, especially since my samsung has 10s of thousands of more hours on it.#3 - Screen wipe feature isn't that great for a tv like this.  It needs a much more powerful one.All in all, I would still rate as a 4 star, however, you have to baby this far more than anything I ever imagined.  You can't even watch a 30 minute show without turning the screen wipe feature on at least 2 times during commercials or many times if its a standard 1 hr show.Kind of regret the purchase because I just don't want to constantly worry about a TV.  Beautiful looking tv in every way and is exactly what everyone says about its quality, however, because of its abnormal sensitivity to image retention and burn-in for a plasma, I am kind of wishing I went with a LED so I can just watch a show without worrying or focus on work without thinking \"did the kids turn off the tv.\"", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "really dark", "Author": "FH-Ace", "ReviewID": "R1LMUV5JVBDF7A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Loved my previous Panasonic Plasma, but this one is disappointing.Forget watching this model in a bright room.

Every time I connected the Panasonic to my Denon, the Denon would crash and become unresponsive.  Switching back to the old TV immediately resolved the problems.  I upgraded my Denon to a much newer model with explicit support for 3D/1080p/4k, and the crashing problem went away.  This was not an expense that I had planned for, so I'm still not exactly happy about it.From a user perspective, the TV doesn't support flat out disabling the speakers (a feature the old one had).  And a real annoyance, once the TV was set up on the internet, it immediately started showing ads when I adjusted the volume control.  You can disable them, but they're on by default, and it seems ludicrous that a very high-end TV, priced at $3300, would include ads at all. (Note: See Edit 1 below)There's also some strange glitches related to power-on order and timing.  If the TV doesn't get an HDMI signal from the receiver fast enough, something goes wrong with the handshake and the TV and audio don't work.  For instance, activating the Internet Radio feature of the Denon provides an On-Screen Display of the station info and navigation menus.  I have to power up the Denon and wait at least 5 seconds before powering up the TV, otherwise, no sound or picture.The picture, once adjusted, is fantastic.  I used the settings for a previous model as detailed in Consumer Reports, and once I adjusted it the picture went from muddled and dim, to absolutely popping with clarity.The 3D feature is great.  I fired up my PS3, and it detected the new display and capabilities.  Games now offer a 3D mode, and look fantastic.The TV has a bunch of built in content and features (like Skype and NetFlix) but I haven't been able to set up ARC (Audio Return Channel) to route audio generated on the TV back to the Denon AVR yet. (Note: See Edit 2 below)So, I generally recommend this set.  It might be a bit tricky to set up, but once running it looks great.Edit: The TV also includes ads on the App Store page (for things not related to Apps) and these ads can't be disabled.  Again, it seems absurd that a TV as expensive as this would include ads *anywhere*.Edit 2: I got the ARC feature working, and can now use the TV App features with the audio going to the Denon AVR.  This was not exactly straight forward...first you need to enable the ARC feature on the Denon, then go into the TV, into the *Apps* section (not the setup menu!) and select the \"Viera Link\" app (which only works *after* the AVR is configured into ARC mode) and tell the system to use the Home Theater instead of built-in speakers.  This was made more difficult by the fact that the printed instructions for the TV are very minimal, just a few pages to get it running.  The detailed documentation is in the TV itself, in an App, and it uses a Q&A; navigation style that made it difficult to find the necessary info to configure ARC.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not reliable", "Author": "mbtlny", "ReviewID": "R19KDY7QHEEOXU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Enjoyed the TV for two years until the screen went blank and the 7 red blinks hit.

My older Panasonic plasma has never had any issues playing this same game on it for several hours at a time. It's an online game, so the matches are only about 10 minutes, and then we go back to a different screen for a while until it finds a new match.

The internet stuff is a big improvement - much faster, more capability, etc. Camera, voice recognition, etc. Great picture on movies and most TV shows.

But even shows and movies are a bit on the dim side or wash out a bit if you boost brightness to max. Sound is good for a modern, thin set. Screen is reflective. Overall, I would have to say that the set is not as good a picture as the old Samsung, though it is better in some respects. The old Samsung had very good whites, was brighter in general without washing out, and had a very good anti-reflective screen. Unfortunately, Samsung does not make a 55 inch plasma and their high end plasma is almost twice the price as the Panasonic. Haven't used the 3D on the set, so can't comment on that yet.

There isn't much i can say that hasn't been said 1,000 times already unfortunately. I researched and compared for over a year and considered multiple products and product lines and tried a couple. I landed on plasma's after researching best picture quality and was a bit surprised, consumer's ignorance had shaped my perspective/assumptions. I must admit there was a down-side to all the research though, i began to rely completely on it as opposed to first hand accounts. I say this was negative but it could possibly be a positive too i guess. I basically began to give too much weight to the tiny gripes and negatives & not enough to the fact that once you are in this range of models it is truly nitpicking, especially if you aren't super experienced in these things. I assumed i would be as sensitive as others to these minute specs but its not about knowledge, these people have trained eyes that see things we dont or in ways that we don't. Anyway, i was very worried about it not being bright enough as well or that it wouldn't be give a picture with pop if it had less than stellar brightness but its not even close to a issue or a potential issue for me. Neither is glare. no matter the time of day or how many of the 100 watt bulbs i put in ceiling fan & position towards the set it never becomes an issue. I am lucky to have it in a room that doesn't have too many hours of super concentrated direct sunlight but its by no means a room with no light either. Looking at them in best buy (barring Magnolia) isn't going to do justice to your viewing environment either most likely. Unless you have many windows with alot of direct light i wouldn't even consider hesitating on this purchase a moment longer, and honestly even if i did i still wouldn't hesitate because Amazon makes things so hassle free that if it turns out to be a issue you should be ok. The only negative in my whole experience* (this is not in anyway a reflection on the TV) which was a huge deal up until the moment amazon made it not a huge deal is i would think twice before buying a TV of this size, especially a plasma with a glass panel from Amazon Warehouse Deals, i was able to get it all taken care of and buy a New Unit instead.My only other suggestion is that for anyone buying Plasma, it really behooves you to \"become your own advocate\" so to speak and do some research and become informed about the good and the bad so that you can help yourself get the best experience/picture quality/and not have any issues that you could have helped prevented.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "good tv", "Author": "scap7", "ReviewID": "R29I51F235BWJ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have had this Panasonic Plasma TV for about a month.

So bright scene will get brighter, but any dark will look extremely grainy with little definition.Graduation is poor, and this panel will not give you 256 levels without dithering.It also requires pro calibration to make this panel correctly display colors.Without calibration, expect to see a gray scale with discontinuity.Sadly this is not a reference monitor, and there is a slight 'sharpening' filter that you can't disable.Its very slight, but its visible even on the internal menus. Edge of text is ever so slightly green/purple.Like all plasma you have a retention problem, so beware of what you watch. Also This panel has not addressed the plasma streaking with some material.Another issue with plasma that actually got worse... Not you have a strong buzzing noise, that is amplified by two active fan. Sound about the same as a ps3.But most is mitigated by being far enough from the TV. Noise is then just faint, the dithering pixelization blends, the slight fringe become invisible, and you can create a day and night setting to help with the low brightness.And to be clear, upclose the image is hard to watch. So make sure that this TV will be watched from at least 8tf away.3d... Not a huge fan, so I don't have much to compare it with. But the panel not being that bright to begging with, the glasses make everything look even more muddy and dull.Overall , when this TV is professionally calibrated its ok, none of the issue listed goes away but from far the panel delivers pleasant colors. So this vt60 strong point is uniformity and no leakage associated with backlighting technology.Weak point: cannot reproduce video without dithering, overall dimm causing a lack of perceived contrast, relatively loud, sadly not a reference panel since some internal signal processing cannot be turned off.I have yet to measure active power consumption, but from the heat generated and its 600+ watt rating, this wont be the cheapest TV to operate.I have not use the TV smart, beside going into the menu to disable banner advertising...Yes folks, by default this TV will spam your screen with banner advertising every time you power it on.Make absolutely sure you can return the TV if you still want to get one...Because if you have high standard you might be disappointed.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Picture but annoying issues", "Author": "Karthik", "ReviewID": "R3GPQYXFB8TW7L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got the TV with high expectations.

I read countless reviews for this TV all claiming it has the best picture of any TV on the market. This of course excluded UHD and OLED sets. Wanting the best for my Blu-Ray collection, I finally pulled the trigger. I purchased the 65\" model knowing that this set would soon be extinct given Panasonic's decision to remove themselves from the plasma market.To be clear, I wall mounted this in a dark bedroom with black out liners behind my drapes. While not completely dark, it was likely darker than most rooms during the day-time. After testing numerous calibrations posted on various sites, I was never able to get this set to a brightness that I was satisfied with. The image just looked to dim for my taste. Maybe I'm just used to my OLED screen on my Note 3 with brightness turned all the way up or my IPS monitor that's also very bright. Whatever the reason this set just didn't cut it for me in the brightness department.The other thing that bothered me was the look of the menus. They just seemed for lack of a better word, ugly. The layout, and the color scheme just seemed like an afterthought for Panasonic.One of the included pair of 3D glasses was also acting up for some reason. While I was watching Wolverine in 3D one pair kept shutting off for some reason. They were never used prior to watching this film so that ruled out the battery. About every 15 minutes they would just shut off. I had to keep pushing the power button and they would sync to the TV and run for another 15 minutes. That got annoying quickly.Lastly, let's go over the decoding capabilities with this set. This is rarely mentioned on review sites because I imagine most people don't watch their HD content the way I do. I like to have a file with all the menus, special features, and previews removed so I just have an uncompressed copy of my movie to be played in an .mkv container. This leaves me with a file that's anywhere from 20-40GB in size. I attach an external USB flash drive containing the file to be read by the TV's decoder. Unfortunately this TV just doesn't have either the processing power or the proper decoders to play the media in my .mkv files. My friend has a Samsung 55\" set that would play all my files perfectly.All this being said, I'm sure there are those that swear by the picture quality of this TV. I'm just not in that camp. I prefer a brighter display with the decoding capabilities to play my media coupled with a nice looking menu UI. Unfortunately I had to return it.

All panasonic did this year was to make the blacks a tiny bit darker, and in the process, they dimmed out the whole image, which was a mistake if you ask me. The expert reviewers claim that the VT60 has \"great\" speakers for a flat panel, which is not true at all. The speakers are very weak and sound tinny,.. Last years GT model has actual subwoofers, which you can tell by listening to them compared to the VT60, which doesnt have them. Alot of people here seem to love this tv, but my advice is, if you are about to buy the VT60, I would suggest that you savesome money and just get the ST60, it's brighter and wont have any loud fan noise,  It may \"buzz\" but its not as bad as the fan noise and you only hear the buzzing during very bright scenes..

After extensive research, I decided that a \"Smart\", Plasma TV was the way to go, and this model was the one that everyone was raving about! I purchased the Panasonic TC-P60VT60 at Best Buy, Santa Clarita, CA, convinced that this was one of the best TV's in its class that my budget would allow.(Mistake number 2). As is customary with any purchase at Best Buy, they offered me an extended warranty, but at around $700 for a three year coverage, (when considered as a percentage of the cost of the TV), I felt it was too expensive and declined it.(Mistake number 3). I really felt that after my trouble free Sony, and with Panasonic's excellent track record and loyal fan base, that I had nothing to worry about. I left the store (ignorantly) happy with my purchase!!!  Geek squad came and installed the unit on July 3rd- (another huge expense). Geek squad were amazing. Highly professional and extremely knowledgable, despite hitting me up for very expensive cables...something that was not fully explained in the store.

I do not want to go through the hassle of waiting for technicians, and having them mess around with such an expensive unit. I complained to Panasonic and told them I did not want a \"repaired\" TV, I wanted them to stand behind their product and send me a new one...but they WILL not replace this lemon of a TV that I currently have hanging on my wall. Oh! and did I mention that before the repair company will touch it, the TV has to be off the wall?!!! That's is a huge undertaking in itself!  I feel Panasonic should stand behind their product and replace the unit that is so expensive, and highly reviewed.

A call to Panasonic confirmed that the Flash plug-in that would allow such viewing has been disabled and cannot be downloaded.
