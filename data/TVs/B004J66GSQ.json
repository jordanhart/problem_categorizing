Amazon refunded me the difference between the 299 price and the 244 memorial day price at a major dept store. So, it was a very good price. As for the TV, I was expecting something to meet basic needs in a home office. I don't have an HD box in the room so I started out just connecting to cable and seeing what the QAM tuner could find.  I didn't count the channels but...there's a lot.  The major channels are coming in HD and the picture is nice - bright and clear - color is nice. I'm not extremely picky so if you are a videophile: 1) don't take my word for it 2) why are you looking at a bargain basement 32 inch TV?  But if you are looking for a basic set, seems fine to me. Doesn't seem as crisp as my panny plasma or mitsu dlp but...so.  Remote is basic, but fine. Sound is fine. I see lots of picture and sound adjustment options but haven't played with them yet.  There are no weird bars on the right side and no pixels wrapping around to the other side (in other words I didn't get a faulty set).  And for the person who wrote a review based on different TVs they bought 4 years ago...no, this one doesn't have that problem either. I can't speak to longevity for obvious reasons. If I run into a problem in a few months I'll try to remember to come back here and update. If you are like me and were looking for an inexpensive set to do a basic job, I don't think you will be unhappy. I'm tempted to give it 5 stars based on the fact that it is everthing I wanted/expected it to be but...it didn't change my life or anything.  And that's my story.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "No name brand that delivers on its promise", "Author": "Miss Rev View", "ReviewID": "R3L8LVQNWKHSYC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a 32\" tv that has clear picture, and sound, with ports to spare.

I had been following the price of this TV, and it has continued to come down; I wound up getting it for $229 with free shipping; so the price was outstanding, to say the least.  I unboxed it, hooked it up to my DirecTv HD receiver, and was watching it in fifteen minutes.  If you have a newer DirecTv remote (RC65R), there is a Sceptre code for it (apparently older remotes use a Sony code to program), and I programmed mine on the first try.  I watched a football game right after powering it up, and I was simply BLOWN AWAY by the picture quality; my 50 inch Samsung in the living room has NOTHING on this inexpensive Sceptre.  The menu is very easy to navigate, and since the speakers are not top quality (what do you expect for $230), you will need to get into the audio mode and modify the factory settings, or use external speakers as others have said.  It has an internal equalizer, so making the speakers sound more than tolerable was very easy.  I've only had this TV for a month, so it remains to be seen if it is of good quality, and lasts a long time.  So far, I can't say enough good things about this little gem; the picture quality for the price paid is out of this world.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Satisfied", "Author": "Lauren Stoll Rose \"tamarazz30\"", "ReviewID": "R1DHR4YQ1OTB6M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For 230 dollars its a steal.

This TV is suppose to be 720p but when i connected my PS3 i was able to get it up to 1080p and 60hz, so i am more than happy, the picture quality is amazing, the sound is great and i have no complaints to it.

This wouldn't be an issue for me since I use my stereo for TV sound (Pioneer 100-watt/ch receiver, vintage 1980 and has never skipped a beat; original Bose 301s).  However with the internal TV speakers turned off the TV remote doesn't control the volume.  That's a design issue, not a quality control defect, but it's a big negative for me.

This is my first new TV since the '90s, so it's possible that anything at all would look good to me.

Slightly annoying, but my biggest issue with this television is that, when playing a DVD, the \"widescreen\" aspect setting stretches out the picture. You have to set it on \"normal,\" which then under-utilizes the screen, because you have a 32\" screen but a 22\" picture. Also, it is pretty slow to turn on and slow to change channels.
