{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Truly Outstanding LED Television", "Author": "Ray \"A Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R221REUHIWXX18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Series 6 6400 LED television is, in my opinion, one of the most impressive on the market today. If you have the opportunity to see one operating next to similar models from the other major brands (yes, even the leading ones) you can immediately see what sets this set apart from the others. A truly rich, vibrant, and crisp picture which is shockingly realistic when you pump it with a true HD signal. It even does well with non-HD signals.The physical design of the set is striking. It's hard to believe, but this unit is only about one inch thick, and when you see it from the side, its hard to make yourself believe it can actually function. Add to that that the built-in speakers actually sound pretty good, and you'll sit there and scratch your head as to how this can be possible. Yes, as difficult as it is to believe, somehow Samsung managed to cram speakers into a set than is only one inch thick which actually sound pretty good. As I sit and listen over time, I'm still surprised.But of course the major factor is the picture quality, and after long comparisons with other brands, I've come to the conclusion that nothing on the market is close to it in its price range. Colors are bright, rich, and vibrant. The 120 Hz motion flow seems to work very well indeed. And if you have a large existing DVD collection, just use an upsampling DVD player and this TV does a great job of recreating a near-HD image. But, as I say, when you browse over to a true HD channel, the image quality is shockingly realistic. This appears to be a set that should do remarkably for the coming years, featuring everything except 3D (if that interests you). The LED technology is clearly superior to standard LCD technology in terms of both image quality and power consumption. Really, there is no comparison between LED and LCD technology.The unit comes with a litany of features which are too long to list here. The unit has PIP (yes, its there, even though not advertised much - dig through the menus and you'll find it there), a number of preset adjustments for both audio and video, plus generally full manual control of virtually every setting. The 46\" size is a large, but not overpowering, size for an average living room, and the potato-chip thickness coupled with a relatively low weight means you can easily point this on a wall, if desired (separate mounting hardware required). The unit supports Internet connections using a wired or wireless LAN hookup (wireless USB key purchased separately), can play both photos and videos off a USB drive, and has multiple hookups in the rear for computers, HD sources, and component video. It goes on and on.I've bought nothing but Sony televisions for 20 years. I've always appreciated Sony's leading edge technology and design, and when it came time to replace our big Sony Trinitron set, I went into the deep investigation of LCD, LED, and HD televisions. That I picked this Samsung speaks volumes. Compare one for yourself and see if you agree. This is a class leading set. And these comments on the 6400 will likely be applicable to all Samsung LED sets, regardless of the specific series.Five stars for a quality build, four stars for price (a tad high), and six for picture quality.", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good buy", "Author": "Charles A. Schuler", "ReviewID": "R1VUTUMZZLSCDH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll provide a PROS and CONS type of review:PROS:  Really nice picture.  I invested a fair amount of time on this aspect by visiting retail sites where I could see several brands displaying their best.  This is subjective, as the signal source was not always the same.  I found that some retailers connect the sets with the big price tags to the better sources.  Anyway, I cannot fault the in-home performance that I am seeing with decent signal sources.  Colors, sharpness, brightness and contrast ratios are all five stars.  Internet features are very nice and seem to work well (but can be a bit of a chore to set up ... see the CONS).  Rear-panel connections are standard for a TV of this ilk.  Audio is not great but is actually better than average for this type of TV.  It is good enough that many users will not have to add equipment to enjoy it.  Physical design is sleek and very modern.  The base is well designed and should support the main unit safely.  The PROS are strong and all merit 5 stars.CONS:  The remote control is finicky.  I might have a bad one.  Wireless Internet was a no-go here.  Was on the phone with Samsung for over an hour and no solution was found.  I returned the wireless Samsung dongle and bought an Ethernet cable to connect to my router and all is working great.  Setting up accounts (for streaming movie content) for this TV has not been a no-brainer in all cases but all problems have now been resolved and watching streaming movies with all the user controls associated with owning the movie are worth the hassles in getting it working.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Problems with Dark Scenes", "Author": "S. Le", "ReviewID": "R1AZ5U6FSHZ7TG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Does anyone have any problem with watching the dark scenes in a very dark room?  My Samsung UN46C6400 TV looks like I'm watching the scenes through a haze because of light leaks at the edges and uneven brightness at the left side of the screen.  When the screen is supposed to be totally black, mine looks like the cloudy sky at night with patches of brighter spots at the left side of the screen and at the edges.  Is my set defective or it's the way edge-lit LED TV's are supposed to be?  I have tried turning the back light, the brightness, the contrast... all the way down to zero, pictures look dark but the problem is still there.  Changing the settings to \"Dark\", \"Darker\"... does not help the problem either. Other than that, the normal & bright scenes are stunning and the sound is really good.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "TV Worth Watching", "Author": "M. Anderson \"Be Cool, Stay In School\"", "ReviewID": "R36S2SHFSAGM0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I totally agree with Ray \"A Reader\" about this t.v. I just paid $1250 for mine at Costco with instant manufacturer's rebate. I've been a Sony person for years and years. However, I bought a 23\" Samsung several years back for use with an Xbox and I now firmly believe in Samsung quality and inovation. When placed side by side with Sony, Toshiba, and others, this t,v. stood out hands down as having the best picture quality. It is a gorgeous t.v. and very light for it's size. Check one out for yourself. It is worth your research time.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "I only rated it 4 because there might be something better.", "Author": "Atman", "ReviewID": "R1IO5R3FLYNUN7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Oddly enough, my biggest problem with this TV is that it is almost too realistic. Seriously...the picture is so sharp, so vibrant, with incredible contrast...it's almost creepy. The 120hz refresh rate is the big dif, I guess. You see every pore, every hair, every detail. Combined with a Blu-ray player, your mind will be blown. I've simply never seen a picture like this. We bought the 6400 version at BJ's because it came with an instant $500 rebate. But even at full price, this TV would be worth it. Razor thin. Very slim bezel (the frame around the screen). Very easy set-up. I recommend getting a Samsung Blu-ray home theatre set-up with it (we got the 1000w six-speaker set). They work together seamlessly, with the Blu-ray player and TV recognizing each other; no settings or screen sizes to mess with, the Blu-ray player takes care of all that. With four HDMI ports and every other combo (USB, component, optical audio, etc), the TV has it all.", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "SS", "ReviewID": "R1NWN5ZHJRFTMT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is our first HDTV. The picture quality is phenomenal. The clarity and sharpness bring out even the smallest details (like pimples on an actors face or sweat on a sportsman's neck...). Colors are stunning especially on sports channels. Sound quality for a TV is excellent. For a lot of people like us, this TV's sound is good enough that we don't need a home theater system. I use a wired connection for internet and high speed internet from comcast and the set up and ongoing performance are great. Apps from netflix, youtube, pandora and picasa are great and easy to use.Cons:Process of registering apps like youtube and picasa so that you can access your account through the TV is hard. Manual in general is sparse and not very helpful.Remote is very hard to use for searching content on the internet.Closed captioning not available when you connect cable box using an HDMI cable.Overall though this TV is excellent from a design, styling, picture/sound quality and performance perspective.I got it for $1079 from Costco. MSRP is kinda high...", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money!", "Author": "Amber Science", "ReviewID": "R3CVFSHV80VA7J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent quite a while comparison shopping before settling on this Samsung, but I knew this was the one I wanted the first time I saw it - the only question was whether I could get a decent price.For what I paid ($980), nothing else I looked at was even close.  Sony and LG models priced several hundred dollars higher were dim and dull by comparison and even TVs that cost twice as much weren't noticeably better.Some of the more expensive units have better built-in sound - like anyone who really cares about sound is going to use it! - and the Samsung remotes are just OK, but if your main criterion is ridiculously sharp, vivid, surreal picture quality, this is the way to go.Minor gripes:  The screws that attach the TV to the stand are tiny and short (a function of the flat screen); they don't inspire much confidence.  I'd prefer a matte black base and bezel, and I'd rather have a product that is a couple of inches thicker and engineered more solidly.  Major gripes include the piddly remote and Samsung's gimmicky Internet functionality.  Still, the picture quality offsets all these and then some.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Almost a great TV.", "Author": "M. Kemm \"Med Maverick\"", "ReviewID": "R25D3O9VR1TH2B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this TV recently and really enjoy it but its not perfect.Advantages:1. Great Picture2. Internet Apps (like Netflix)3. Easy set-up overall4. Price (albeit, I got mine for $999)Disadvantages:1. NOT wireless, you need the \"samsung\" adaptor2. Only 120 Hz, with my DVD player rapid screen movement causes \"shifts\" in the video3. Non-QWERTY remote = very slow typing into youtube. As other apps become available that require typing search entries this is going to get annoying4. Networking with other devices like a computer involves downloading a samsung program & \"uploading\" file info into it to be able to use it on the TV. Some video formats arn't accepted, like the format my camera uses to store video clips. (Would have preferred something more simple like what windows uses on my home networked computers)Bottom line, if you want a flat screen for TV/DVD/Cable only get another 46\" without Apps for a lower price. If you can get this one for a great price, do it! If you want better internet capability, wait another year and get the next version of the Sony/Google TV after they work out all the bugs as that TV has a full web browser along with use of the Android market for Apps.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture, confusing software", "Author": "tribble \"tribble\"", "ReviewID": "R3KQ7SK7ZLNDNN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV looks fantastic, but the software is a little clunky and difficult to figure out.

I tried the LCD version, returned it due to light leak.  Then I got the LED version and the light leak appears to be getting worse all the time.

What you cannot judge on the showroom is \"will it work with my devices\". This one will not connect reliably to my VBR231 Blu-Ray player.  The only \"help\" Samsung support could provide was \"upgrade the firmware\" which was already current. and \"We cannot support other manufacturers products\".  I have to turn-on and shut off the system 5 or 10 or more times to get the TV to \"see\" the player.  VIZIO tried to help but, in the end, the player is working fine, the TV just does not want to co-exist with products from other manufacturers. Leave Samsung alone. At least don't touch this one.  Someone talked about working with Netflix. Not the one on my wall. Can't get it to connect at all. The wireless seems to work but none of the apps function.Addition, after the third firmware upgrade and getting a Samsung BlueRay player the TV is great.  Most of the problem was in the Vizio player, the Samsung and RuKu devices worked first time and every time.
