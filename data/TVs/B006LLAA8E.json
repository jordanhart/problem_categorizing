Big mistake. The tv does not work. It will power on but there is no picture or sound. This was an issue from the day I bought it. I have a warranty but the company states that this known issue is not covered so I will have to either pay to have it fixed or buy another tv. What kind of company doesn't honor their warranty or back their product?", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "good tv", "Author": "waxy \".....and stuff\"", "ReviewID": "R11DFICPCDC5CM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good tv for the price. the only problem I have is sometimes the remote won't work.But after a while it'll start working again.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Crap!", "Author": "Haley", "ReviewID": "R3SM7V0ON624ZV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this and after a few months the thing crapped out on me!  It took me about 6 weeks to get a new one with the warranty, and I had to jump through several hoops with the manufacturer to get them to make good on their warranty, and it has this fuzzy spot in the corner that won't go away.  I'm not even going to bother trying to get it replaced again.  Not worth the hassle. I asked for a good brand TV for Christmas.

Have had a DVD/VCR combo that is a total malfunction POS for Insignia. The TV, a plasma, got about five years into its service life before experiencing what is probably a faulty capacitor in its power supply- the the unit turns right back off after turning it on. Performance is also just so so. Power hungry, and ghost images form very quickly with a still screen. It also makes a high pitched sound which is annoying if you are using as a monitor with no sound.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Installed in moterhome.", "Author": "tom", "ReviewID": "R1TDKPH3MRTKS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just installed it s week ago, we have using all week, great picture and reception.Purchased @ Wallmart $235. otd.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "32\" HDTV built-in HDTV Tuner 2 HDMI Ports for High-Definition Playback\nTabletop stand with screws, Remote with 2 AAA batteries\nComponent video cable, audio cable, Cleaning cloth\nQuick-start guide", "Name": "NEW Insignia 32\" Class / 720p / 60Hz / LED-LCD HDTV 2 YR LMTED WARRANTY*", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4163ku7tZpL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006LLAA8E"}}
