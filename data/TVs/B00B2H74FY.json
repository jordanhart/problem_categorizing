{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sharp smallish TV!", "Author": "Stephen Bidwa", "ReviewID": "RDR390X6H5873", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was surprised to find that it was hard to buy a TV smaller than 35\" these days.  This TV has worked out perfectly for a small side room we have.  The TV is very light, and was easily mounted on an articulated wall mount.  The colors are crisp and the picture is defined.  It's not a huge TV, so I've never spent time obsessing over the picture quality.  But it presents detail-oriented programs like ice-hockey games crisply, making it easy to follow the puck movement.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Video with Media Player", "Author": "Jewel585", "ReviewID": "RK889HJPDFURV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered this TV because it advertised to have a \"built in media player\" that plays videos, music and photos with a quick input into the USB port.  Yes to music and photos, but NO to videos. DISAPPOINTED IN NO VIDEO!!!  I have only had the TV for 3 hours.  All else seems easy to operate and has great quality picture.  It's not tv's fault.

The sound isn't great. Purchased the Phillips sound bar and  turned off the sound on the TV. Surround sound is great on the sound bar. This TV is just the right size for our small family room.  Got it at a great low price ($229) from Amazon.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Never disappoints", "Author": "R.

Made this purchase without doing my usual research based on a prior good experience with the brand. Ended up giving it away and bought the Samsung UN32F5000, top rated by Consumer Reports, and it is excellent for roughly the same price.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good buy!", "Author": "Robert A. Baron \"Give me data, not opinions\"", "ReviewID": "R2EDY2O3D5Q0B4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent TV--and like all Panasonic products I have purchased, a very, very good buy.  Our house is filled with Panasonic products--and they all work very well--and have been exceptionally reliable too. This TV is just another example of the excellent price/quality relationship for which Panasonic is well known.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best out there for the size & money", "Author": "J. HOUSMAN", "ReviewID": "R2RXZV2KW83JLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already own 3 Panasonics  One just like this unit, a smaller one and a real big one.  I have owned Panasonic tv's since 1995...never a lick of trouble.. Had to take the 1995 model to the Salvation Army a few years ago, to make room for the big guy. My old one was perfect...would not die.  Got rid of it because like most people, we wanted a big flat screen.  If I need another tv, I would order the same thing. As usual, Amazon had the best price.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's okay TV", "Author": "Anil Motwani", "ReviewID": "R6V222N8U65XN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I found a defect but Panasonic support does not want to admit that its a defect. The program information on the upper part of the screen (when you press \"i\" button on remote) shows wrong time. I am located on west coast and it is showing program time for the east coast. There is no way to correct this per Panasonic support. All my other TV's show correct time. Panasonic support will not even consider opening a trouble ticket for this.Other then this its a okay TV. Picture is sharp. Volume on Netflix is low and have to turn it up all they to 90 to hear.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Deal", "Author": "Catherine \"dogwalker\"", "ReviewID": "R2WRNOM20LGKBI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture is just so so on this TV but I do not  have it hooked up with HDMI.
