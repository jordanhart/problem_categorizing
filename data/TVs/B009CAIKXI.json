We have had several Sanyos for different rooms throughout the house over the years and feel it is a good brand for the (generally less expensive) price.  Picture and sound are both decent, and we love the ability to use our laptop/tablet/phones using HDMI cables and Xbox 360 with the other hookup!  Although after 2 years it did start an annoying habit of randomly shutting off and restarting itself.  It doesn't do it often, just enough to make you think someone is messing with you or you sat on the remote or something...  Overall it has been very worth the cost, though.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money on Sanyo products.", "Author": "KIM PILGRIM", "ReviewID": "R14THA17ENXRS8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had television just over one year with very limited use.  Was watching and it cut itself off.  Tried turning it back on and saw picture for a couple of seconds, then heard a weird  pulsating sound.  I turned it off and it will not turn back on.
