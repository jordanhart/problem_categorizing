First of all, installation was a breeze, camera and mic work beautifully as do the motion controls.More importantly, the image is perfect. I don't know what these other reviewers are going on about but screen uniformity is phenomenal and on par with any of the other LED LCD tvs I've seen. Blacks are deep and inky and with the backlighting on the factory default, I saw no evidence of flashlighting or light creep.3D works like a charm. Set the PS3 to recognize the new screen and the new 3D glasses pair with the TV quickly and easily and don't mind at all if I look away from the screen. Tested out Transformers 3D (don't laugh, I have 6 year old son and he loves them) and the image was crisp, detailed with very little artifacting or crosstalk. I fired up wipeout HD 3D and that performed beautifully as well.For me, it was between this TV and the new Panasonic line up. While I agree that the plasmas handle blacks better than LCD screens, I prefered the image crispness of an LED LCD panel. I am not disappointed and more than happy with the es8000.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "simply amazing", "Author": "bbilt", "ReviewID": "R30R3JA42WYAGH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a samsung un55d6000 LED tv...which I found to already have a stunning picture.I purchased the new 8000 series and unboxed it. very nice. placed it on the wall using the ultra slim mounts...and off i went. For starters, I got a good deal on the TV and was just going to try it and turn around and sell it. But after using it I said No way. I'm keeping it. It's just too freaking amazing.Let's start with the picture. I can't say enough about how great my picture is...using my basic tv outdoor antenna. its truly incredible. after a month i still stare at it in amazement. pure joy. and those who complain \"on occasion\" about the bleeding or whatever. who cares. its during a rare blacked out commercial. get over it. has no issue when watching tv. the picture is stunning.Now on to the small bezel. Well I thought this would be cool but a gimmick. wrong. simply amazing. its all picture...you are looking at. and from a sideview its super thin. crazy. The thin bezel and lighted LED \"samsung\" at the bottom is very classy. it says expensive. i buy a tv as a piece of furniture just as much as something to watch. beautiful in every way.on to the features: voice control. i don't use it much. i sit too far away to use it by the tv microphone, and don't really use the voice control remote (tv comes with 2 remotes). so i don't really use it. Gestures: cool but doesn't work for me b/c my room is dark. only works in very lighted situations. and even in the middle of day, my room isn't lighted enough. cool feature, and it does work, but i don't really use it much.on the remotes: the touchpad type remote with voice control i don't care for much. i like the standard remote like with the other lesser tv's...and until i get the new keyboard remote then i will stick with this.netflix, vudu etc.. works perfect. no issues.web browser: works good but hope they have the ability to make text bigger when you do searches. (font size increase??) otherwise you stand close to the tv to read browser text. surely they thought of how to do it, but i haven't figured it out.anynet+. works amazingly well with my panasonic bd320 bluray/3d player. plug and play. can use my one remote for that bluray player.tv speakers: they stink. seriously. big deal. love the thin size and bezel.  i bought an klipsch energy powerbar elite with 10\" sub. amazing sound. done.dual core processor: works great. no lag. no issues on smart tv apps etc like the older 2011 models.fitness apps. nice addition. especially since its free on samsung tv's.3D picture. really nice. i have to say. even avatar bluray no in 3d was amazing picture/colors.allshare. works great. no issues.dual view with samsung phone/tablet. works perfect. i use it on my tablet on my patio...to watch tv. no issues.overall I think this Tv,PICTURE, bezel, microdimming... are truly stunning.  and remotes aren't perfect. the new keyboard remote will help.so nice to look at. its a keeper.Update: 12/26/12. STILL LOVE THIS TV. LOVE IT EVEN MORE.Even after nearly a year of owning this. this is one amazing piece of equipment. people always comment on the amazing picture and bezel-less display. its phenomenal. and samsung keeps updating the software for smart tv, its quick, has everything needed, and works great. NOW THEY finally UPDATED IT WITH AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO/PRIME APP. which is awesome. I was waiting on that.TRULY an amazing piece of equipment. Skype even works great on it! would have bought it all over again for sure!and the remotes app for the phone work great...as well.web browsing is pretty good as well. fairly quick, yet flash video is spotty. but reading is great. and it has a zoom text feature which is awesome.and allshare works great with my galaxy s3 phone by samsung. pics, videos from the phone shoot up to the 55 in tv. brilliantyou won't be disappointed. this is much better than apple tv plugged into a regular hdmi tv. by far.not even a close comparison. seriously.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great image, confusing network issues with some apps", "Author": "rtrski \"Who, me?\"", "ReviewID": "R81LLFS9WPJ8H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have had TV for a weekend now.  First, a note on what I'm judging against: my last TV was a Toshiba 52\" 'slim' DLP (13\" deep, internal projection) at 720p, that didn't even have a built-in tuner, e.g. an \"HD-ready\" set from about 7 years ago. So maybe anything would have pleased me by comparison!!But by that comparison the picture is night and day.  I've read all the reviews about 'flashlighting' and 'off axis contrast decay' and yadda yadda yadda with edge-lit LED backed LCDs.  I don't care.  It looks brilliant.  In fact the image is so crisp and clean that I can't help feel that shows I formerly thought were a bit 'gritty' and 'realistic' now have an almost unnaturally perfect-lit and colored crispness to them in 1080p, the oft mentioned 'soap opera effect'.  I'm sure I'll get used to that.  At the backlight level I'm set at (haven't entirely settled but running between \"11\" and \"13\" on the scale right now) the off-axis contrast is fine; our viewing positions are about 9-11ft from the set and separated by about 3-4' which puts us < 15 degs off 'normal' to the set face.  The glossy screen does glare a little with ambient light, but even thru that the pic is clearer than thru the 'matte' hence more diffused reflection we got at all angles with the DLP set.Built-in tuner is pretty powerful.  Just hooked it up to my in-attic antenna (which has a long cable to get down to the living room) and we picked up every channel the old DirectTV HD receiver did (which also has an OTA tuner, and which we were using even though we stopped our DirecTV subscription several years ago) and then some.  (Maybe part of the benefit is the DTV receiver had to have the OTA/sat multiplexer splitter in line, but then again it also had an inline amp).TV came out of the box stating no new firmware update was necessary, so I'm wondering if they're somehow updating existing stock before shipping as others have needed an update.  Don't recall what number FW it says its on at the moment....might add in a comment if people are curious.The only star minus I'm giving it right now, which may NOT be fair as I describe it further, is that some of the network apps were a b***h to get working!  For the first couple of days I could not for the life of me get either Netflix or the Samsung App Store to load.  I'd confirm my internet connection (tried wired and wireless), could use the browser, could access the trial videos on Hulu+, the Pandora app gave me the option to register the set...but neither Netflix not the Samsung App interface would ever get beyond \"Loading\" and/or the dreaded \"Network Interference Occurred\" or \"We are unable to connect you to...\".  This despite a good connection and being able to use Netflix on any laptop on the same network.  What gives???  So I hooked up the new Blu-Ray player I selected (Panasonic brand, so as to get Amazon VOD which is not available on the Samsungs) and lo and behold, although Amazon worked, Netflix still didn't.  Basically, that was a red flag that it was something in my network.Sure enough, a new wireless router configuration (and although unrelated, a new ADSL2+ cable modem while I was at it), and Netflix and the Samsung App store both load.  Go figure.So fair or not (since the Blu-Ray had the same hassle, and it *was* my network somehow) I'm deducting one star for having to have some sort of perfect network setup to use Netflix (again, laptops and desktops on the same network don't seem to have this issue, so that's my beef).General impressions may change with furthur usage or if something breaks in firmware, but I think given how good it is now I'd be willing to give them a chance if they \"break\" something to \"fix\" it in an upcoming (hopefully quick) version.  Of course any new user review like this doesn't factor in long-term reliability.About our setup overall:TV is connected via one HDMI (HDMI2 with ARC) to a new 3D-capable AV receiver, Blu-Ray set to passthru the receiver (1.4a compatible for 3D), Wii connects to receiver as composite video and audio (using AVR to provide the 1080p upscale...might move that to TV and see if it upscales better).  DVD folders from my Sage HDR300 server look really good (those are getting upscaled by the Sage box to 1080p).  Even standard def TV channels look fairly nice given the source quality (and on digital broadcasts, that means they're being upscaled by the TV only from 720p or 1080i, I assume, with the standard def to 'broadcast digital' def upscaling done by the channels).  Blu-Ray from Panasonic does auto-24p when it recognizes incoming content and I did notice that with HDMI passthru to the Samsung the pans were creamy smooth. So I'm not relying on the TV to handle that.  Did notice that Netflix HD streams are a bit less smooth in the pans, so might have to play with the telecine correction and see what mode works best for whichever inputs.  Have not noticed bright banding around the 'black bars' on anamorphic widescreen Blu-rays from the edge lighting yet, but only watched 2 so far.  Nor have I noticed any real flashlighting but again, very limited content watched so far.  Coming from the DLP where blacks weren't really (the matte screen alone resulted in a dark gray), I doubt I'll be disappointed even after more viewing.Not included in review so far:Haven't tried 3D yet, 4 pairs of included glasses are as yet unboxed.  Haven't mounted TV on wall yet, it's just on the stand on the media cabinet in 'front' of where it will eventually be mounted (viewing distance given before includes the extra space, in reality we're a little closer which puts us at a slightly wider viewing angle today).  Have not played with the touch remote - intend to program a Harmony so didn't want to confuse myself with stuff I couldn't emulate in an all-in-one, anyway.  Came with the standard and the touch remote.  Haven't attempted the gesture and voice control either.  Meh.  Only real reason I got the ES8000 vs. dropping down to the ES7500 or even the ES7100 is that a) supposedly had the 'best' dimming processing, and b) it was already out.  The ES7100's will be a couple months yet.Overall, color me impressed.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, but I am returning it.", "Author": "Brandon Taylor", "ReviewID": "R2HMT227GASDV7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV, fell in love and ended up returning it due to a factory defect (a large dead pixel right in the center). I ended up getting a Viera plasma and think it has a much better picture, but I wanted to review this TV since I still feel it is amazing in many ways, and is still a worthy purchase despite its exorbitant price.First off, this TV is sexy; it is simply stunningly designed and looks very elegant. The base is unique, the bezel is almost non existent, and the faux chrome edges and base make the TV slick and stylish. Second, the layout of the menus, the web browser and apps, and look of the on screen guide is as good as it gets. Also, the HDMI and other ports are located on the bottom right, which, to me at least, is ideal.So, why did I return it and not just get a replacement since it was a simple dead pixel defect?*The sluggish speed of loading the apps and web controls*The hand movement gesture feature isn't as glamorous as they claim*The smart remote is buggy, and works intermittently*The white halo blotches. The brighter spots throughout the screen are noticeable during dark scenes*Night scenes are not that great, whereas plasma provides stunning night scenes*I suspect quality control concerns with the TVAll in all, the features to me when I was ordering the TV were extremely cool, but I realized I would never use them. The style was nice, and I miss how sleek it looked, but the picture quality of my new Panasonic GT series is substantially better. I am actually happy about the defect. If you want style, extreme thinness of the TV, the intuitive and elegant menu design, and abundance of apps, then you will love this TV. Just know that plasma TV's do provide a better picture quality, but still have their downfalls.

The picture quality is excellent, 2D and 3D. The voice control and motion control work flawlessly. Just make sure that the room is well lit if you are using motion and the room can't be noisy for voice control, if it is noisy you can just use the mic on the remote, another great feature, so you don't have to shout at the tv. The allshare feature is a plus, you can select folders and files from your computer that the TV can pull up on its screen wirelessly. Another big pro for me is that the TV turns on quickly, not like previous HDTV's that you turn on and you have to wait about 30 seconds for it to power up and turn on. This TV is on in 3 seconds. I highly recommend this TV to anyone looking to buy a new one.  It is definitely worth the money, plus it can be updated in the future. The second remote that comes with the TV can also control my TiVo which is nice because the TiVo remote cannot pull up the menus for the TV and with previous TV's I had to always grab a second remote to do that.I know the review is kind of all over the place, but overall a great TV that I would recommend to everyone.

This is the TV to have. It's not the biggest TV but IMO has the best video quality for my viewing pleasure.Excellent video quality.The wireless internet is nice but the streaming video quality isn't as good as the streaming video I get from my Samsung 3D blu-ray player. Not sure why, but it's significant.If you are plugging in your blu-ray directly into your TV then get a Samsung blu-ray player. Using their BD Wise technology you should get a cleaner picture. But really, if you are going to get this TV then you probably have an AVR and a decent sound system. I ran into some audio sync problems when using my AVR with this TV; the video lagged a bit behind the sound which is very annoying so make sure your AVR has an audio delay feature. I had to adjust my audio to delay by about 7 frames. Right now, my blu-ray player only has one HDMI output which goes to my AVR; if it had two HDMI outputs I would send one the the TV and the other to my AVR; I would think the Samsung blu-ray to Samsung TV would be most ideal but really haven't tested it enough yet. Still waiting on a Samsung blu-ray player with two HDMI outputs.I can't really say enough about the picture quality from this TV. I don't really care about all the bells and whistles. Just give me great picture quality and I'm happy and this TV delivers.The 3D movies I have seen so far are spectacular. Both from blu-ray and on-demand trough my cable service. Buy the more expensive rechargable Samsung glasses. They are rechargable via usb and are guaranteed for life and are much better IMO than the two standard 3D glasses that came with my TV. I have a pluggin 4 port usb nearby my system just for this purpose so I don't have to charge them with my computer. Oh, make sure your AVR is 3D Ready and has an audio delay feature.Lastly, don't be cheap on the HDMI cables. Buy the best you can afford. I got the Monster cable Max 3D hyperspeed 1000 >21Gbps. And only use HDMI cables! You can't get DTS HD audio via digital opt or digital coxial. You must use HDMI !", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "What an amazing tv!", "Author": "J.

The picture quality is fantastic once you make some adjustments in the picture setup menu.  For some reason Samsung ships their TVs with settings that have the backlight and contrast maxed out so once you readjust some the picture is amazing. I replaced an older 46\" Samsung with a large bezel and this fits in the same space and yet has the much larger screen.  The way the picture comes right to the edge is great and really adds to the experience.On black screens the edge lighting does not seem to be a problem at all, you can see the lighting is slightly non-uniform but that is a black screen with the lights off in the room, under normal watching it is perfect.When I ordered the scheduled delivery times offered on the order page were for Tuesday the 20th but I opted for the stardard delivery and the company called me offering delivery as early as the 17th The delivery service was very good, when they arrived the unpacked and setup the tv for me and made sure it was working properly before leaving.The video I added is a demonstration on the Spears & Munsil Calibration bluray.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN55ES8000 - \"THE TV\"", "Author": "Subha", "ReviewID": "R39UFZMAEBO0JB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this at the end of Jan just before the prices went down. I did lot of research between different Samsung models and finally pulled the trigger on this. The models that I considered are UN55ES7150 at Costco and UN55ES7500; This TV is by far the best TV out there if you get a good one and not a lemon. I read so many bad reviews about this TV and was skeptical myself too but then my wife gifted me this TV for my birthday and it turned out very good.Few interesting things about this TV:1.Initially you need to be little patient with this TV as you may not like the picture at first as this TV does take some time(around 3-7 days depending on the usage) to break-in and after that the picture is excellent.2.This TV requires high speed HDMI cables that support 3D, Audio Return Channel & Internet something like this...Mediabridge High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet (6 ft) - Ultra Series - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard]. You will be disappointed if you use the cheap old regular HDMI cables.3.The sound from this TV is less compared to the other models I mentioned earier and getting a sound bar is recommended. Something like this...Samsung HW-E450 Wireless AirTrack Sound Bar4.The webcam on the TV is a very useful feature as you can chat with your friends & family via Skype and the controls and features are pretty easy & convenient. The camera can be rotated upwards so that it does not automatically turn on the motion sensor like some complained in the reviews.5.I bought a flat antenna to get the Over the air(OTA) HD channels and the picture is close to real. I have posted some pics in the custom images section.The picture on this TV is stunningly beautiful and the colors are rich & vibrant and the blacks are deep. Edit: I have posted some pics(NFL interview & some TV show pics) that I have taken with my iPhone 5 in the custom images section and the links are listed below just to give you an idea of what I am talking.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2BRD6S02T9SR4/B00752NJMChttp://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2BOETFWFCC1Z/B00752NJMC###Update 3/5/2013####6.The 3D on this TV is actually quite good if you are watching Real/True 3D movies, although I could not watch it for more than 30 mins as it gave me headaches. This TV has a capability of converting regular programming to 3D programming and it is not bad at all but the actual 3D movies have much better effect.7.I found that this TV is much faster than the above mentioned TV models in terms of response time, operation and playing digital content. I connected a 500GB external HDD via USB and the TV reads the media pretty fast with no lag and it plays them great too. I also found that The All Share from my laptop via wifi is also pretty quick while playing the pictures on the TV.I am yet to calibrate my TV with a calibration disk and am waiting for the disk to arrive. Also, I read online that we can connect regular bluetooth keyboard and mouse to this TV. Yet to test that and will let you know how that goes.

Barnes", "ReviewID": "R3TZR84N83GNES", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture is really great.  We have Directv and our previous TV was a Samsung LN46B650.  I can definitely tell a difference with the picture.  It seems so much more vibrant than out other TV, and that TV is only 3 years old.We bought the new set from a brick and mortar store.  It fit in the back of our Chevy Equinox perfectly.  My wife and I were able to lift it in the box easily.  Setting it up was harder than the previous TV though.  The LN46B650 slid into a base that you could easily turn from side to side.  The UN55ES8000 base has to be screwed integral to the TV.  The set can be moved because its so light but the pads at the bottom of the base squeak when you adjust it.  Our living room and kitchen are open to each other and it was nice being able to adjust the TV when moving from room to room.I find the remote a little hard to use if we are watching something with the light turned down.  The buttons are so close together that its hard to differentiate the functions by feel, like on our Directv remote.  I wish it was a little larger and could emulate other remotes.I also find the glasses to be a little painful after 15 minutes or so.  I wear sunglasses quite often and never had the pinching feeling that these 3d glasses give me.  I looked at the reviews here on amazon and I guess I'm in the minority with the discomfort level, though my wife doesn't like the pinching either.  I was surprised that the batteries aren't rechargeable either.  The glasses are light though.I wish I could add another half star.  The picture is really good.Update after about 9 months :The picture quality is still great.  I haven't found my self using the gesture control feature at all, too many remotes in the house already.I do hate that they changed the base on the TV. The previous TV base made it so much easier to adjust the TV depending on where we were in the living room.  Adjusting the UN55ES800 with it's integral base sometimes makes we worry about damaging the set.  I really wish there was an aftermarket swivel base.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good and Bad Together", "Author": "Meg", "ReviewID": "R3IEJAWI9ZCWD3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After the third set I decided to give up on this tv!This is a great tv in terms of picture quality, colors, design, connections, GUI, calibrations, web browser, skype camera etc.etc., and actually it is one of the most advanced televisions on the market.On the other hand it has huge flaws. All my three sets had big clouding problems (the first had a dead pixel too). In the day light everything was almost acceptable but, in a dark room (also with lights on), big clouds were visible on the bottom and the left and right sides of the screen. Bleeding back-light were visible too in every corner of the screen. Some confusion also in the software that enable/disable the CE dimming and Micro Dimming Ult.: both present in every Mode but not in Movie Mode. In this way the clouding + bleeding effects were amplified.Talking about off-axis viewing, well, the blacks fade to grey easily and the colors wash out when you move from the center position, so it is an issue.The build dates of my sets were February, April and May so it wasn't the case of a single \"defective stock\". From some forum comes up these problems are still there in the panels built at least until August included.I read that these kinds of problems tend to decrease/vanish after some weeks of use, for this reason I kept (and used) my third set as much as possible (just until the end of the free return window), but in my case no improvement occurred.I know also that this kind of back-light technology (LED Edge-Light) always tends to have some screen uniformity, clouding and bleeding light problem (no matter which brand) but in these Samsung sets is far beyond the acceptable limit.Wonderful tv devastated by a very very poor build and quality control!I have been informed in Europe these kind of problems are not so bad: Why the \"quality standard\" in the Samsung's Mexican  factory is drastically under the average compared to the others?Samsung must work on this!The last but not the least, I wanna say thank you to Amazon. They took care of my problems providing me three sets of tv including the final return. When I called them for the problems with my third set they honestly suggested to me do not go for the tv nr.4 but simply go for the return+refund  instead.

I should have learned my lesson when my recently purchased 7000 series Samsung 3D TV failed. I thought it was an isolated incident and couldn't possibly happen again so I decided to take the plunge and buy another Samsung. This time a top-of-the-line 8000 series with all the bells and whistles. Within 3 weeks of owning, a blue line ran vertically down the right side of my screen. Since it was under warranty, I was able to have it repaired at no cost (repair man actually was the only positive part of my experience). That's besides the point -- the TV was only 3 weeks old, now sitting next to my malfunctioning 7000 series TV that was not much older (but now out of warranty). The service technician suggested I contact Samsung to request an accommodation -- I pay labor, Samsung pay for parts. Sounds reasonable so I called Samsung and requested. As you might imagine, Samsung did not entertain the idea, hiding behind a warranty technicality. Of course, Samsung is under no obligation to assist in the repair of my 7000 series, but from a business standpoint, losing a customer who has already purchased (2) of their higher-end models, and the negative publicity I intend to disseminate as a result may make their decision a poor one. As much as they would like to believe this issue is isolated, the countless message boards of customers experiencing the same issue speaks volumes. Maybe lightning struck twice in my case. I for one will not find out the odds of lightning striking a 3rd time. Goodbye Samsung.

The default factory settings would make your picture too bright and black would be too gray. I decreased a lot of those default values and totally love it.The TV can also learn to switch channels of your cable box (I have DirectTV).

My heart sunk a little everytime a movie would show a dark screen and my eye would be pulled to the dot. I then checked on Sumsungs policy and was very happy they have a zero pixel tolerance for this model, especially with its location. I had an serviceman in my house three weeks later and even got to help him replace it. Picture is now perfect, but you will find youself switching the picture mode back and forth from \"natural\" and \"movie\", depending on what you are watching. One thing I would like to point out, for those of you who are worried about privacy with the camera mounted to the top, like I was; DO NOT WORRY, it has a very small physical knob on the back of the camera that allows you to rotate it down so its lense is completely blocked. If you plan on using it for 3D I would like to warn you that you will have to replace your old HDMI cables for the high speed HDMI cables they sell now.

What I can tell you very simply is that this TV will change how you view television.  The picture quality is so unreal.  Even when you are not using 3D the picture simply has more depth to it.  When friends come over they are stunned at the quality of the picture.The Smart Hub feature is awesome.  I can view anything from my Amazon Prime Instant Video account, Netflix, Hulu, and many more.  The TV also immediately picked up my media server on my network and I am able to stream movies and music from my server over my network.  All the setup for this was a breeze.  My kids use the Netflix app all the time and love it.Finally, this TV is beautiful.  The thin bezel is amazing.  The sleek style and design is absolutely beautiful.  This is how all TVs should be.  I strongly suggest this TV.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picture quality is great, voice&gesture; control almost useless", "Author": "Tobias", "ReviewID": "R12V1YBLINTTVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using the voice feature for a while and must say, I'm pretty disappointed. Or not so much disappointed, as I was somehow expecting the voice implementation to be way subpar. And boy it is.I've been using Siri for a while now, so I know how a well-implemented voice interface can look like. (Even though I'm not 100% happy with Siri either, which I will write about later). Samsung's promise is to control your TV simply with your voice. The obvious functions would be volume&channel; control, and powering the device on and off.Let's start with the volume. The TV can go up to volume 100, but the voice interface only allows you to control volume levels up to 20. That's just silly and makes it pretty much useless. Furthermore, the recognition of the numbers is pretty inaccurate. When wanting to control the volume relatively, you can say \"volume up\" and \"volume down\", but that will change the level in increments of 1, which again is pretty silly, as that will hardly make any difference. Jumps of 5 or 10 (or configurable increments) would've made way more sense.You can mute the TV with your voice, which is a useful feature.Let's move on to channel switching. In a typical set up with a digital DVR or some other external device feeding in the TV content, the channel function obviously doesn't work at all. You're not using the channels of the TV, rather the channel lineup of your DVR. The channel switching function therefore is rendered completely obsolete. Even if you use the TV channel lineup, you can only say numeric channel numbers, not the channel names. Again, that is very silly.Turning the TV on and off works reasonably well. No complaints there. (On the other hand, as you usually have to turn on your DVR as well, you have to reach out to a remote control either way, in which case you might as well hit the button on your TV control as well).What else can you do? You can control the source for the signal (to switch between the different HDMI inputs). That's a good idea, however, the implementation again is suboptimal. You first have to say \"Hi TV\" to turn on voice control. Then \"source\", then wait it to be recognized, then \"source 2\u2033 or \"source 3\u2033 etc., instead of simply saying \"source 2\u2033 or \"source 3\u2033 right away. So it makes you go through two commands instead of one (or rather: 3, instead of 2). Needless to say how silly that is.I could go on like that, but I think you get the idea. The voice feature in the end is pretty useless. And I do understand the challenges with a room microphone versus one that is close to your face, but still, don't advertise a functioning smart TV if it is not functioning, and not very smart. (And I'm not even talking about the gesture control, which is another pretty useless feature).I can't wait for Apple to come out with a really smart TV. That will be the next device category that they could revolutionize completely (and will, if they try, no doubt about that). Go on, Apple, it's your turn.PS: I love the picture quality of the TV. I didn't buy it for voice&gesture; control, but for bright HD, good 3D, and overall picture quality, which is where it excels.", "Date": "November 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent LED and Samsung Product.", "Author": "Jaciel Torres", "ReviewID": "R2O187WJ7G5OI4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to write a review about this Samsung LED tv because I've been seeing a lot of unjust reviews for it.  So I wanted to throw in my honest 2 cents.  I had a Samsung LCD 32inch before I took the plunge and bought this tv.  I like Samsung.  Never really have had any problems and was impressed at the time with the LCD.  That was back in 2009.  SO I wanted to go all out on a tv since we were moving in a new house.  Walking in to my local Best Buy This Samsung UN55ES8000 immediately caught my eye.  The really skinny trim boarders, the quality and colors of the screen, the aesthetics etc.. I was hooked.I bought the tv and had Geek Squad install it the next week.  During that week before the installation, I saw all these mixed reviews.  So I was getting a little nervous about it.  After the installation, all those worries were put to rest.  The TV produces Amazing and I mean AMAZING images and quality.  I'm blown away by the tv.  I\"m a heavy gamer and movie watcher and was just blown away of how those media are displayed.  Gears of War 3 look crisp and bright.  The colors really stand out. I even put in the 1989 Batman blu ray and was blown away at the quality.  It looked quite amazing for such an old movie.I saw a lot of worries about the tv being slow or unresponsive.  I have had no problems.  And in fact the TV is very fast.  When switching between Inputs or Samsung App Hub, or just between menu items in general.  It was very VERY responsive and fast.Connected the tv to the network and the tv was also very responsive there too.  I browsed through the app store and they have quite a bit of apps.  You'll get lost for quite sometime browsing through what they have.  I'm glad to see Samsung investing some resources to that app store.  The apps usually don't take up too much space, but unfortunately this tv doesn't come with too much space either.  I don't know if I'll run out cause I only downloaded Skype, Netflix, and Pandora, since those are the only apps that interest me.  But it was quite disappointing to see that they didn't at least include a 2 gig flash memory or something.This tv comes with two remotes.  I was a little disappointed that  it didn't come with a remote that had a full keyboard on the back or separate.  It came with a typical remote that can light up and a second one that you can use as a touch pad.  I have not opened or used that one and to be honest I never will.  Even the Geek Squad guys said the touch pad remote sucked.  So unfortunately that was a little disappointing.Also, as everyone knows by now only 3 HDMI inputs.  My  previous 2009 model Samsung LCD 32inch had 4.  That was a bit of a buzz kill.  IDK how thought that would be an adequate amount but unfortunately now a days we need 4 or more.  It does include 3 USB inputs but I don't see myself using more than 1 or 2 at the most.In regards to voice recognition and the hand movement detection. As soon Geek squad installed my tv, the first thing I did was made sure that those two features were turned off.  I'm not interested in them and never will be.  So there won't be a problem with that. It doesn't interest me whatsoever.  I bought this tv for a TV.  Not a kinect.I also hooked up a Samsung HT-E5400 5.1 Home theater surround system.  I initially had some trouble setting it up because I couldn't get all the speakers to play in true surround.  I'm new when it comes to speaker and home theater systems.  I decided to call Samsung Support and was very pleased that they actually were quite polite and handled the problem effectively.  After hearing all these horror stories about their support in the reviews, I didn't know what to expect.  I had to call them about three times because I had questions about the sound system and every time they were polite and solved the problem or my questions.Conclusion.  If you are looking to go all out on a high end tv.  You won't go wrong with this tv at all.  I'm not only impressed but beyond blown away with the images this tv produces.  The aesthetics are very pleasing to the eye and its very quick and responsive.  I bought a 2 year replacement warranty just to insure my investment.  I really don't understand how people here writing negative reviews didn't do so in the first place.  I know it sucks to buy a new product only to not have it working.  With technology you are subject to failures.  Its just the way it is.  So with any big investment I always try to insure my product. That way should any problems arise, it handled quickly.  You will not regret this tv.  And I'm glad to say that I can at least be living proof that a lot of the negative reviews for this TV are flat out BS.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Okay tv", "Author": "A", "ReviewID": "R2AYONVUEA2TAC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good tv..but hand motion doesn't work..voice control needs a remote(then why the voice)Better to take the asme 55 inch samsung regular tv", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "~~~Worth every penny!~~~", "Author": "Jennifer Recupero Mamone \"Author of Bio Creat...", "ReviewID": "RPDAFELWC1RXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband came home with this huge box, I thought he was nuts for buying it but after having it for a month, I have to say you can really see every detail.

Today is the 16th and it's back in the box waiting to be picked up for return.  The picture was amazing, easily the best I've seen from any tv after researching thoroughly over 2 months and comparing dozens of models from several companies, including the much heralded plasmas.  There wasn't a single image that appeared blurred or pixelated during the Olympics and football, baseball and hockey might not look this good live!  Having said that, the image out of the box was way too bright for my liking and even after a lot of tweaking was still a little on the bright side.  The blacks sure were real black but again after tweaking things like black suits kind of blended into dark backgrounds though to be fair they didn't look that way out of the box, only after tweaking the tv so I didn't need to wear sunglasses to watch it.  2d-3d works ok.  I wouldn't wnt to uy the tv just because of its upconverting qualities but the 3d from a 3d blu-ray was jaw-dropping.  Transformers 3d looked better on the tv than it did in the theater.  Matter of fact, it wasn't even close.  The Olympics, on the 1 3d channel Fios was nice enough to provide, looked incredible.  Wish they had more 3d content available on Fios, other than the ESPN 3d channel they want to charge even more than the exhorbitant rates I'm already paying for the priviledge to watch.The sound was pretty good in my opinion.  I never once had to turn the volume up nearly as high as on my current Sony, just to hear what people are saying.  Late in the evening I even had the volume on #5 and that was still plenty loud enough in my large family room when the kids were in bed.  I don't understand why anyone would say it has poor sound.The apps are somewhat lacking.  There are some very good ones, and I was shocked to see it had MLB.tv built-in so I didn't need to use my PS3--the picture was even better than on the PS3 too and looked cool in upconverted 3d as well.  Skype worked very well, image was better than on my tablets or the kids Ipods.  Pandora worked fine & sounds great.So why is it going back?  After spending numerous hours over the course of the last week it absolutely refused to play a 3d movie if I had my Onkyo receiver turned on.  Even using an HDMI switch (3d capable) and running 1 cable (using Monster Cable Ultimate) to the tv and 1 to the receiver I would either get an error that the tv couldn't play the 3d content or the receiver just wouldn't output any audio depending on which order I turned my equipment on.  Now, how absurd is this?  I've got a receiver that cost over a grand just a couple of years ago and a $2k+ tv and I can't have them both work at the same time.  Who's brilliant idea was this?  Talk about screwing over the consumer.  Samsung's solution for me is to spend yet more money on a 3d blu-ray player with 2 HDMI outputs!  Cheapest 1 I found was $240.  Either that or a new receiver.  Now there's a heck of a choice.  I wasn't to happy with the idea of watching movies on tv anyway after using my projector on a 120\" screen for 12 years.  I could buy a new 3d projector for much less than the cost of this tv and be happier.  But something for a lot of users to keep in mind who have receivers more than a couple of years old.*Update 8/18/2012*  Well, the unthinkable happened in my house--my wife and kids actually talked me out of returning the tv and had me buy a blu ray player with 2 outputs (a Panasonic BDT500 due to the recommendations of Amazon reviewers).  First time this has ever happened, usually it's the other way around!  After putting the 1 year old Sony back up they were all disgusted by how bad the picture looked in comparison to this set.  Anyway, best thing I ever did.  I don't think my receiver has ever sounded so good.  From impeccably clear voices to the tiniest obscure sounds from the surround speakers, it was a real treat.  I have a Sunfire sub and I could feel the massive air movement with some booming bass from across my family room and the concrete floor was vibrating--and that was just with the Lorax 3d!  Can't wait to see and feel Transformers DOTM 3d.Due to the new blu ray player, I've not updated my review to 5 stars but will keep the negative comments for prospective buyers to understand what they may be getting into.  The fact it currently comes with 4 3d active shutter glasses and additional ones are only $20-$30 depending on the store, not to mention the free 26\" tv for 1 of my kids really make this a 'reasonable' value at the moment.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Read bad reviews first", "Author": "AL201", "ReviewID": "R2HVMWA4SR1HUD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst customer service ever.

The tv will shut off reset, go back to the show you were watching then back to vertical stripes.  The only way to stop it is to unplug the TV.  We called Samsung support they were kind and sent out a repair man, he replaced the motherboard (at least that's what he said) and to call him if it happens again within 90 days, guess what it's now February and the TV is now unplugged and on the wall.

Having been extremely satisfied with 3 samsung lcd tv's I've owned in the past, i decided to buy another. I wanted a 46\"-60\" silver smart tv, with a slim bezel, active 3D, and at least 3 hdmi. I was considering the 7100, 7500, and 8000 and ultimately decided on the 8000 series due to specs and aesthetics.I preferred to higher clear motion rate (CMR) of this tv vs the others.it produced excelent  picture even with fast motion. it also had the voice an motion control functions which seemed very forward thinking. As someone who constantly misplaces the remote i found myself using the voice control a lot. It is in no way as intuitive as Siri on your iPhone but still works well enough for basic tasks. Motion control on the other hand gives mixed results. I found it activated itself randomly. When i use my macbook in front of the tv, it thought the apple logo was my hand every time. Then, it sometimes wouldn't activate when i needed it to. I found i rarely used this feature except when it was a simple task that was quicker than actually reaching for the remote.Aesthetically, this tv is gorgeous! Also, because its silver it goes with any decor. The smooth lines of the base look like a work of art. The bezel is so slim the tv disappears into the night and all you have is a beautiful picture that seems to be floating in midair. samsung outdid themselves with this tv.There is a steep price difference between the 7500 and 8000 models. I finally chose the 8000 55 inch because of a great deal on amazon warehouse deals. After owning the tv for about 3 weeks it began to randomly power itself off and on for no reason. after doing some research i found this is a known issue with all smasung 8000 series tvs. some people have payed upwards of $500 to rplace the motherboard on the tv, which seemed to be the only fix. Luckily i was still within my 30day return window, and shipped the tv back asap. as beautiful as the tv and picture was, it is useless if it only stays powered on for 5 minutes.

I feel robbed of $2,900.00The repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....basically, buy another TV.SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at 20% per year, and they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!

I also got this TV in particular because of its slick design and thin bezel. The TV is georgeous and the refresh rate is stunning (240Hz).Reviews stating that clouding is an issue are really knit picking. If you look very closely on a black screen then yes, you will see some \"lighter\" areas, but that is the nature of LED. People should be aware of this before purchasing considering LED. But I never notice this when I am watching a movie so this is not really a con for me.My main concern I have with this TV is the Samsung software. You would think with a dual core processor, samsung would be able to run their apps smoothly, but I have had a lot of issues with lag. This is only present in the Samsung apps. Netflix and youtube are perfectly fine. I think this may just be because they did not take the time to optimize their apps.The motion control functionality is cool to show off to your friends, but is not used regularly. The camera is nice for Skype however. The voice control is actually pretty useful on this television. I would say about 75% of the time, I turn on my TV by voice activation \"Hi TV. Power on\".Aside from that, the only other con I have is the smart remote. For me it has been very slow and buggy which is why I opt to use the traditional remote that is also included.I haven't had an opportunity to watch a 3D movie on this TV, but I am confident that it will look great!", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Close to perfection but no cigar", "Author": "Mrs. L.

The fact of it is that the browser is lousy.

In fact, there is only one compatible format. So, for all practical purposes, it is not functional. The keyboard & mouse functions are also quirky, but so what, if the internet doesn't work well it's not a concern.I wasted over $ 1,000.0 to get the net on a TV and I ended up with nothing more than I had before except a TV that was 4 years newer. I really feel sorry for those who bought larger Samsungs with the same fault and paid much more.If you are interest in good surfing abilities with a TV sized display your best bet is a laptop with an HDMI port to feed the video signal to the TV.

THE PICTURE THAT SAMSUNG PROVIDES IS THE BEST ON THE MARKET. COMPARED TO EARLIER SAMSUNG MODELS, I LOVE THE ULTRA-SLIM BEZEL OF THIS ONE COMBINED WITH THE SAMSUNG SLIM TV MOUNT. IT LOOKS GREAT ON MY DARK COLORED WALL WITH THE WIRES/CABLES RUNNING DOWN THROUGH THE WALL. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE TV, AND WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT ANY OTHER BRAND. I RARELY USE THE TOP-MOUNTED CAMERA FOR VIDEOING. I USE MY DIRECTV REMOTE 99% OF THE TIME, BUT THE STANDARD REMOTE IS VERY USER-FRIENDLY AND THE BLUETOOTH REMOTE HAS A MICROPHONE THAT WORKS GREAT WITH SKYPE OR OTHER SPEAKING APPS. THE ONLY FEATURE THAT I WISH WOULD WORK BETTER IS THE VOICE AND HAND MOTION COMMANDS. WHEN WATCHING TV AT NIGHT WITH THE LIGHTS OFF, THERE IS NEVER ENOUGH LIGHT FOR THE CAMERA TO PICK UP MY HAND MOVEMENTS. THE TV MICROPHONE CANNOT PICK UP MY VERBAL COMMANDS, I'M GUESSING BECAUSE OF THE LOUD TV VOLUME? OR BEING SO CLOSE TO THE WALL? OR POSSIBLY AN ECHO EFFECT?

Also the crystal clear quality of the images that run throughout all 55 inches of this monster. Not only is the image quality amazing but also this TV is sexy it is simply stunningly designed and looks very elegant. It is more beautiful than the hottest women I have seen. The base is unique, the bezel is almost non-existent, and the faux chrome edges and base make the TV slick and stylish.

However, the picture quality and other technology has a number of problems. I am too busy to go into details, but the bottom line is, if you crave design/style and are okay with a mediocre picture, buy this TV, otherwise you may want to try another set.UPDATE:My gripe with this TV is that the picture quality is mediocre for the price. This is supposed to be Samsung's flagship TV for 2012, yet the picture quality is comparable to my Sony LCD from a few years back.I will start with the negatives of the picture quality of which this TV has many:The picture is noisy/grainy. If you watch this TV from more than 5 feet away, you will probably not notice the graininess, but if you watch it any closer, you will definitely see the pixels. This was even the case for HD Blu-ray movies.Next, the TV has a narrow viewing angle. If you watch this TV straight on, the colors are beautiful, but if you deviate from the center, you will immediately notice a rather drastic wash-out effect on the colors. It almost looks like there is a thin gray haze covering the picture from off angles.Samsung also claims this TV has smooth motion 960, but this poorly executed at best. In fast action scenes, the blur is very obvious. My 4 year old Sony TV has better motion smoothing than this TV.In all honesty I can only think of two good things about this TV. The first is the colors are vibrant when viewed straight on.

I checked back on Sunday and my order had not shipped yet so I contacted amazon to see if my order could qualify for the samsung galaxy tab instead of the $50.00 gift card since it had not shipped yet.  Needless to say that was a waste of time because I was told I would have to cancel my order then reorder and depending on how long my bank will take to release the funds etc.  We all know that each bank varies in the amount of time that they take to put back your funds and I just did not feel like the headache.  So, as I stated before that was a waste of time.  I at least thought that amazon would adjust it for me as much as i spend on this site but they did not.

I only try to assist those who will listen I have to admit, when they work, mine have had good pictures. I have two 8000 series.  More want to condemn a review than read it.  So, Samsung is the best tv available in the world for that group.This 2012 model TV appears to add hand motions, voice control along with a webcam to make it different than 2010 and more to break down. The picture is the same.  I have posted similar for the 2010 model too.  This one was in error and referred to the 2012 breaking down and it was the 2010 that did.  I hope you get a good one but keep in mind the possible problems with more additions.  Some report on them that have never owned or used any of the Samsung 8000 series TV's.  I suppose you can listen to them also since they sold their encyclopedias a long time ago.  This is a personal opinion from my own observation and I own several Samsung products other than tv's.  It's all in taking a chance.  I thought I was buying a quality TV but two years to me is not quality.  I don't see any visible reasons to believe they have changed in 2 years and have more quality now.  That's from experience.My suggestion is buy the cheapest TV you can find if you are looking for one, with fair ratings.  If it quits, throw it away and purchase another.  That is what I will do and I am looking for another and it won't be Samsung.  You can save lots of money and still get a great picture.  I have TV's that have been playing over 20 yrs with no problems but not this one.  A forum says their design engineers say they are built to last 2-5 years.  Mine was 2.  So, a life expectancy of 5 years for a $3000.00 plus TV?  Not any more for me.  Please take heed unless you want to pay out $$$ like I did.  You know how opinions are, everyone has one, even the ones I am talking about.  Once again for the die hards, this is my opinion, it's like other things everyone has.The 2012 Samsung 8000 is the best tv out there for some so I may as well state that.
