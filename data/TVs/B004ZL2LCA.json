I see bad reviews for this set turning off or something similar.  No such problems here.  The picture quality is so good, it is SCARY real!!!  It was very easy to hook up to Direct TV and the TV remote cloned the satellite remote in a snap.  The sound is very good for a flat screen tv.  Watching HD sports on this is just stunning and awesome. The 240 HZ refresh rate is just BADASS for hockey! All in all I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a big tv with a perfect, clear, bright picture.  :-D", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding TV. Outstanding service", "Author": "Phillip Anderson \"Phil\"", "ReviewID": "R2OYURO42HGOGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Vizio for close to three months. It is fantastic. This thing weighs less than half what my old Sony did. The picture is great and I love the apps. I'm on Facebook almost every day now, looking for new pictures of my Grandaughter. We spent months looking and pricing TV's and finally settled on this one. This was close to the least expensive one I found but don't let that scare you, It's awsome! What set-up? This thing pretty much sets itself up. It found my WYFI connection before I was able to do the set-up. I saw a lot of complaints about the speakers. I must tell you, I don't know. I hooked my surround sound system to it and I don't think I ever heard the built-in speakers. Beleave me, watch this TV and you will want great sound to go with it. The built in speakers are not a deal breaker, you won't use them either. As usual with Amazon, the unit came sooner than expected. The delivery person even brought into the house for my wife since I wasn't there. It arrived in perfect condition. The rest is history. My thanks to Vizio for a great product and to Amazon.Com for a great buying experience.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "First Week - TV Kept Turning Off & Vizio's Rude Support", "Author": "CT", "ReviewID": "R2B7877B3F5WF1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off...I don't hate the actual TV. I did a lot of research before I purchased this TV and I still believe it is worth the price for the way it performs. I purchased it less than a week ago but then it began to turn off on its own...There seems to be some sort of glitch with Vizio's software updates that causes so many of their TVs to turn off on their own that a support supervisor for the company called the problem \"normal.\"  Now I understand that things go wrong and need to be updated, but even though this seemed to be a pervasive problem with their product line they could give me no timeline for when it will be remedied, and seemed to think I was demanding for wanting one.When I stated to the support person I was talking with that the whole situation seemed strange and very not \"normal,\" I was told \"Sorry\" and then disconnected.So basically...Maybe the TV is worth the price, but with the way their support staff treated my issue I'm not even sure what they told me is wrong with my TV is legitimate. When you're paying a thousand-plus dollars for something you want to know there's help waiting if anything goes wrong with it...unfortunately, that's not what you get with Vizio.If you don't mind putting up with lousy support, this TV definitely has a pretty picture!", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Welcoming the 21st Century", "Author": "mcharest", "ReviewID": "R1SNQ3UY6VMC72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My incredible wife got me the Vizio M470SV for my birthday. It is our first flat screen giving away our 25 inch RCA analog to a charity. Our daughters all have said, finally, welcome to the 21st century.We have been researching and looking at many flat screen tvs for the better part of 2 years. After receiving the unit I had no trouble setting it up, getting it linked to the wireless, and am BLOWN AWAY by the quality of picture.  Very impressed and happy.  Would recommend this unit to anyone based on operation, quality of picture, ease of set up, cost and performance.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "JimXSR", "ReviewID": "R3DHDW7YB0K7IS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has been great. I was a little skeptical at first but I am 5 months with the TV and it has been sensational. Came in original box, with remote, batteries, easy to follow user guide. Color, contrast, wifi is all great on this TV. I wish there were more APPs but its still a great TV. Best TV I have every owned.**UPADATE** 12/30/2013By far has been the best TV purchase. Its been well over 2 years with only one minor complaint. Every now and then the tv will turn itself off. No warning or flashing just off. I have to unplug the power plug from behind the tv to get the tv to power back on. Otherwise this tv has been great. I stream Pandora, Hulu Plus, Netflix, YouTube, Weather, Texas Hold Em all the apps work great. I would recommend to anyone looking for a less expensive smart TV.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mixed review on TV", "Author": "P. Leung \"Blu Ray Fan\"", "ReviewID": "RUFZUZ7NLJ6ZQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just bought the M470SV four days ago and want to share my experience.  We were replacing an old CRT projection Phillips 46\" TV from 2004.  The TV picture pretty much started warping on us and the convergence was impossible to fix.The positives first!  The Vizio picture is a stunning revelation in comparison to the old CRT.  Very deep blacks.  Terrific picture quality.  Extremely sharp right out of the box so we didn't need to play with the adjustments.  The TV itself is very light and look very nice when turned off.  Very little glare off the screen so no issues there.  There are a solid number of HDMI inputs so you can pretty much plug in every device you have as long as it has a HDMI output.The negatives now.  The TV takes over 15 seconds to boot up.  No fix for this.  The TV remote and manual power off/on buttons stopped working at least once so we had to unplug the TV to get it working.  This is unacceptable for a TV that is four days old.  The sound is weak but understandable for this kind of flat screen tv.Overall, it's an ok purchase but the time to boot up may kill this deal for me.  I've never had a TV that took more than a second or two so maybe mine is just a lemon.One more note, if you are upgrading from a CRT TV, it does feel like the TV screen is smaller even if it's not.  It just doesn't have the same bulk so appearances are deceiving.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "One month into owning", "Author": "Joshua S. Beck", "ReviewID": "R28N2DT8TGKDXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this television set at Wal-mart on a whim (due to the price).  I had been using my 32\" CRT type television for about 6 years and was waiting for the prices of Flat Screen tvs to enter a more favorable price range.  I have kept my eye on the market and steadily seen improvements in performance as well as cost drops over the years.  This TV is one of the best values available.  Its preinstalled content is just icing on the cake of a television that performs wonderfully, has a clear dynamic picture and makes gaming a fresh experience.  The apps were not something I necessarily wanted or needed, but after using them they are a welcome surprise.  We have a no TV rule during dinner, but that does not preclude us from listening to some music through I<3Radio.  The TV is great and I have had no problems at all, if anything, I feel like I got more than I bargained for and am happy as a pig in slop.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply Outstanding for the Money", "Author": "Larry D.", "ReviewID": "R2I9MXSVK3IS53", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really researched this TV before buying it and found that it has so many more features that others in the same price and category.  I was concerned that others had written reviews and were unhappy with the TV because it was turning itself off.  I have Verizon fios service and have 3 standard TVs in my home.  One of the TVs started turning itself off and I was unable to turn the TV back on using the fios remote.  I had to wiggle the wires and reboot the STB to get it back on.  After wrestling with the problem with Verizon....Here is what we found out.  Nothing was wrong with the TV.  It was the STB (set box top).  The set top box was replaced by Verizon with the same model which I had sent back. TILT! Had the same problem.  However, a technician with Verizon who knew his business, had me remove all connection cables in and out of the STB then clean them with alcohol.  I have not experienced the problem again.  I made sure the new Vizio TV had the proper size cable and clean connections going into and out of the STB..No Problems.

The picture is perfect.  The sound is fine.  I have it connected to my dolby stereo system and it sounds great.  It makes all dvd's played on my Panasonic dvd recorder look HD.  Even old old shows from the 60's.  I almost didn't buy this brand because of negative reviews of the support from Vizio.  Well, I have called them 3 times so far.  Each time was for a minor problem, such as I couldn't find the Yahoo widgets.  Turned out they changed the name of that app.  Similar results from the other two calls...immediate resolution of problem  The tech support people are the best.  They are patient with dumb questions, they answer the call almost immediately without being on hold, they don't sound bored, and you can understand them,  they speak English.

Does turn on slow but all else is great!So far the unit has preformed fine. I have not experienced any of the \"turn off\" issues described in many of the reviews. It will turn off after several minutes of no signal, as described in the manual. We do not have any HD content though our rural cable provider but have watched some std. DVD's and the Quality looks good. Our internet connection is fairly slow (< 1MB/sec download) but have watched several streaming movies from Netflix and Amazon via plain G WiFi router. I'm sure a better N router with a high speed BB connection would give us great quality. I like the internet widgets(apps) more than I thought. Netflix and amazon streaming, pandora radio etc. are nice. The facebook interface is clunky and the news feeds have found little use. We REALLY WISH it had a Skype widget with a compatible USB camera as both of our kids live a few states away and this would be better than huddling around a computer to Skype. Very pleased so far with none of the annoying issues I read in a few of the reviews.

If you have a \"normal\" size living room, the picture size is more than adequate.  Picture quality is excellent, right out of the box.  With 1080p, LED backlighting, and 240Hz refresh rate, I have no complaints about the picture quality.  Sound quality is average (deduction of 1 star).  If you don't care much about the sound, the built-in speakers are certainly adequate.  We bought a Vizio sound bar to enhance the sound, and it works great.  I'd highly recommend buying a sound bar to go along with it, especially for viewing movies, sporting events, etc.  4 HDMI ports and 2 USB ports make it great to connect whatever products you have to the TV (receivers, DVD/Blue-ray, satellite box, etc.).  The internet apps work fine; however, I wouldn't consider them a \"must have\".  The remote works fine, and has a QWERTY keyboard on the back side, which is helpful when using the internet apps and typing in a request. The TV works fine with our wireless router for internet connectivity.  Some folks complain that when you turn the TV on, it takes about 10 seconds for the programming to appear.  I've had a similar experience with each of our Vizio TVs, so it's not a problem with this particular TV.  My thought is...if that's the only complaint you have about your TV, that's a good thing.

Yes, It was this LED Tv. The Price was near double what I got back from my other tv, but only $200 more than what I had on me.
