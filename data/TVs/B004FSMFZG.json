Now it is outdated and will not play new Blu rays . We called Insignia regarding this, and they said tough luck. One manager went as far as you say the customer is always wrong. Please spread the word on this share this with everyone you know. I can't believe a company would be so awful. After 3 years a Blu ray player will not work on new movies anymore . That is ridiculous not to mention it's environmentally harmful to make an electronic that will only last three years ! Please share this with everyone. Do not buy Insignia!", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "i expected a little better image and sound quality", "Author": "bruce", "ReviewID": "R3DDQ10K0NKLAP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i got this tv for my kitchen , the sound level is poor and there is lots of glare coming from the screen unless you looking directly at it at the right angle", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "18-1/2\" screen measured diagonally from corner to corner: Optimal for viewing in small rooms, such as a kitchen.\n1366 x 768 resolution: Supports 720p signals for stunning image clarity.\nTwo 3W speakers: With Audyssey Dynamic volume, simulated surround and sound leveler provide a lush soundscape.\nInputs: Include 1 component video, 1 PC (rear), 1 audio, 1 RF (rear), and 3 HDMI (side).\nAdditional handy features: Include a sleep timer, INlink and channel labeling.", "Name": "Insignia NS-19E450A11 - 19\" Class / 720p / 60Hz / LED-LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41E8nw7ko%2BL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004FSMFZG"}}
