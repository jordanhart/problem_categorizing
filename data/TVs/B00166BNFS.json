{"Reviews": [{"Title": "After a Month", "Author": "Horse with no name. \"Overactive Shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q8UROC7X3SV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Brother owns the 73\" version of this television, and I've been very impressed with that.  Having slightly less room, I decided to go with the 60\", in addition for cost reasons.This type of Display is unique in that, if you go to a store and look at them in daylight, in a brightly lit store, with LCD's and Plazma's all around, you'll think nobody would want a TV like this. It's not as bright, it's 'softer'.  Once you get one of these in your home, and don't have these other overly bright displays clouding your judgement, you'll find viewing on a DLP VASTLY superior to a flickery LCD or HotWax looking Plazma.  The picture is so natural and smooth, it's incredible.  Colors are so spot on, it's amazing.  And, I think, while a DLP isn't as bright, it does a lot nicer job in dark passages than will an LCD.I do not notice any shimmering on this TV as I do on LCD.  I'm a bit sensitive to that and watching one of my own BRay movies at a friends house on a 52\" LCD with a PS3 player, I can honestly say, any hint of buyers remorse vanished when I saw his new display. (which cost more than twice as much btw).  Tonight in fact, his PS3 is coming to play back on my TV so we'll see how that works out.  I'm interested to see if there's jitter on my TV with it.  I use a Home Theater PC for playback and DVI-HDMI for video.  I have no issues whatsoever.  I think I prefer the color representation from the PC better than standalone players.Long term (marathon movie sessions) on this display are not fatiguing at all to my eyes, like other much brighter displays.  Very short periods of looking at an LCD give me serious eye fatigue.  Not to mention, they're so small!  With Plazma especially, I find myself spending more time watching the TV, than I do the movie that's being played on it.  With the DLP, it's like after the first few seconds, the TV isn't there and all you see is the picture.  I think of it more like being IN the movie, rather than outside it.  It's hard to explain and you won't see this in a store.Cons:This sort of display has reduced angle viewing vs a LCD or Plazma.  It is not a great choice for brightly lit rooms or severe off angle viewing.  It's also sensitive to vertical angle changes, even more so than side to side.  Height is critical when viewing this sort of display if you intend to be very close, which I am in my setup.  I view from only 9-10 feet.  Even at that distance, I can clearly see brightness change when sitting vs standing.  This isn't an issue to me because I just don't care.  I like my big screen.If my 9-10feet seems too close, it isn't.  I know that I could easily enjoy a 100\" screen at this distance.  The TV is not too large.As long as you're distant from the TV, viewing height will not be an issue.  As a theater piece, it will be important to set the height correctly for your viewing position if you want the most vibrant picture.  The 735 series has no front HDMI, though I don't care in my situation.  If that's a must for you, go to the 736 or higher.As a PC display, I like this TV, but, there are some handicaps that must be addresed with video card drivers if you are really fussy about filling in the edges of the screen perfectly.  Some setup is required.  It's not troublesome, but, is a bit tricky unless you visit some forums and ask folks how to set things up.  This isn't a TV issue really.  As for PC Monitor use, really, I don't think any display is perfect.  For reading small text, it's just not likely that anyone will use their LCD, DLP or Plazma for this purpose.  Not and like it anyhow.  The TV is just too far away for text viewing. I run 120DPI in windows, and also 150% text in browser.  Like that, it's useable.  I still would not say ideal for long term everyday use.Other Thoughts:PC / Console Gaming on this thing is simply outstanding.  Don't forget, with a DLP, you get to purchase the wireless LCD Glasses and play games like Call of Duty4 in 3D.  These are not the red/blue filter glasses, these are active and actually have an interface to the television.  This is a major plus on Samsung and Mitsubishi DLP Televisions.  Also, the fact that DLP does not \"Burn In\" is another plus.Running an all black desktop in Windows I'm told is an issue because that is sending all the lamp power to the light dump instead of to the screen.  I'm not sure if that causes a heat issue or not, but I tend to keep mine displaying a light color all the time, so as to keep the heat to a minimum.Since I am primarily a movie watcher, PC gamer, all other aspects of the TV are pretty much secondary to me.  For those people who complain about the possibility of needing a new bulb, or that it will become a cost issue over time, I say this.  First, at this time, straight from Mits, a new bulb is less than 100 bucks.  If I bought 10 spares today, I'd still have less money in my TV than my friend has in his LCD that's almost a foot smaller.  Also, I genuinly like mine better.  Bulbs for these are not the $250 they were for units years ago.  My brother had his last projection TV for 10 years and never put a bulb in.  His unit now is over 2000 hours and still looks like new.  If it costs me $100 a year to keep this TV refreshed and looking new, then so be it.  Keeping a spare bulb on hand is probably a good idea if missing a few days viewing might be a problem.Final thought.  If I were to be forced to choose a different display and display type to replace this unit right now, it would be a DLP Front Projector.  I am so pleased with this television, I almost secretly hope it dies shortly out of warranty, just so I can justify getting a projector.  Even if it does not, I'll also have a projector within the next 2 years.  I would never have guessed that after a month of viewing, this TV would look small enough that I wish for something 4 times this big.  Especially in the rather small house, and small rooms I've got to view in.

I noticed it lower to $1299 for cash.An equivalent LCD or Plasma whould have cost me $2500.This is my first experience with DLP and so far I have no regrets (knock-on-wood). The unit weight is light enough for the wife to help you set it up.The resolution and color is easily configured to your liking and hooking up to DirectTV HD is a joy to watch that you can't go back to standard definition.Hooking up via HDMI is a breeze and it does auto sense. Remote Control is well designed and easy to navigate. I was able to program my Yamaha Receiver and DirectTV unit and just use one remote control.CON's: It should have an option like my other TV's to disconnect the TV audio so sound only eminates from my Home Theatre system.Start-up is slower than CRT or LCD but not long enough to complain.I would have chosen the 65\" if it was not for  my TV Niche being only large enough for the  60 \" model. The Sale price difference was $100.Makes you wonder how much it costs for the factory to build a unit?Only time will tell if DLP was the right choice for me but so far no regrets.

Rumor has it that there is a possible class action law suit being reported for all the people who are having this problem. Cost to repair without Mitsubishi's help is about $700 dollars. I've finished the call and Mitsubishi is willing to pay for the $225 chip and has a reduction in service repair from $700 down to $200+ tax that we will have to pay to a TV repair company in our area, that they have made a contract with here in Tacoma.

Recently the picture is getting a bit darker so I ordered a replacement light direct from the company for $119 including shipping. The picture quality is always better if you don't keep the picture on high brightness anyway, stronger colors, more realistic images, and your light will last longer. I'm not a fan of LCD, looks too much like a video game. DLP and Plasma have a warmer and more realistic picture. DLP is used in the best movie theatres. Football games on this 60 inch tv look like you're sitting in the stands. We paid $1250, which was a great bang for the buck back in the summer of '08, and there are still some of these left. It's also 3D ready.Update, October 28, 2011: We've had the set for 3 years now and we just found out about the \"white spot\" defect that occurs on these, Samsung DLPs, and others. There are thousands of complaints about this on the internet, usually after the set is about 3 years old white spots start appearing on the screen because the DMD/DLP chip is going bad. What a disappointment. Don't buy one of these sets unless you check to find out if the sets that are being sold now have a different DLP chip. I contacted Mitsubishi and so far the customer service has been okay, they are going to replace the chip, but not for free. I'll update again when the service is finished and rate their customer service and the corrected tv.Update Nov. 8, 2011: Mitsubishi paid for the part and I had to pay for the labor, which came to $237.00. They replaced the defective chip right in my house and now the tv looks amazing. Not only did the white spots go away but the picture is clearer and exceptional. Overall since I was out of warranty I guess I can't complain although the tv was definitely defective. They say the new chip will last longer, we'll see. Mitsubishi customer service was very good.

We, for a very long time, used a Toshiba Rear-projection TV at 50\" in our living room.  We decided that we would need a TV large enough to take the place of that TV and to make it not look so small.  DLP is the right choice for this since you can get a much larger screen size at a lower cost than LCD or Plasma.  Since we had good luck with our other rear-projection, we figured that we would have good luck with this TV.  Having it for a month now, there have been no issues and our view experience is great.  The matted screen makes glares much less harsh (our old TV had a glossy screen).  The wight of this TV is extremely light for its size, our friend has a 42\" LCD which is much heavier than this.  As long as you're planning to put the TV on a stand, the lack of it being a flat panel shouldn't be a big deal.  1080p content through our Xbox 360 is very detailed and sharp and the TV never lags behind nor have I seen any \"rainbow effect\" from this TV during normal viewing.  The only con with this TV is the build in speakers to the TV are very tinny and all around subpar.

But i do watch dvd movies all i can say is they look great i have directtv with hd channels i set my hd box to 1080p and my channels are crystal clear. my husband let me pick the tv and i decided not to waste another $1000 for lcd and all that stuff i guess i am a litlle old fashion. when we didn't know about lcd and plasma then the dlp was all the rage . well i can see the picture clear and the color is great plus for the length of time these tvs last why waste more money for the lcd or plasma. this is my second big screen tv the last one only lasted for 5 years we are currently looking for a part to have it repaired so far the cheapest part is $700 we are on our fourth month waiting for the part. my old tv 32 in which is 12yrs old has never need a part and did i mention it is 12yrs old the color is great everyone who sees it asks us how much we paid for it $350.00 12yrs ago. my kids play xbox 360 and wii systems on it. my last big screen two bulbs and a fan now some sort of board . it cost over $2000 originally .", "Date": "March 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Mitsubishi Service", "Author": "S.
