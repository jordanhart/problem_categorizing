The picture is barely passable, with severe color shift when even slightly off center axis.  The built in dvd player does not work-- it hesitates, skips, and locks up with all dvds including brand new out of the package movies.  The remote has a noticeable delay from when you press a button to when the tv responds.", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "More than enough", "Author": "Samadhi1138 \"DCC\"", "ReviewID": "R2N2DJ4LFW4DSW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my 15 year old daughter's bedroom.  If you're looking for a centerpiece for your livingroom, this is probably not what you want.  If you want a really exceptional TV for a bedroom or guest room then this is more than enough.  The picture is great in both color and clarity.  The DVD player had no trouble with any format that was thrown at it: DVD-R, DVD RW, CD, etc., etc.  The sound is nothing to write home about, but it is adequate and can be augmented with external speakers if desired.  Overall, this TV was well worth the price paid.", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Audiovox 19\" Flat Panel LCD TV with Built-in DVD Player & Card Port/USB", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31QUJv29o2L.jpg", "ProductID": "B000GUTIKC"}}
