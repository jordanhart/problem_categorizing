{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome television", "Author": "Ronald Mapp \"crash-downhiller\"", "ReviewID": "R2UHS0CDOKRHLC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the Sony XBR60LX900 60\" 3D HDTV as soon as I became aware it would be available, as I was creating a new home theater, and I wanted this television to be the centerpiece of my new system.  My television is mounted on a BDI Avion Series II 8937 Triple Wide Enclosed Cabinet, Black Stained Oak, and connected to the BDI Arena 9970 Flat Panel TV Mount.  The rest of the system includes: NAD T785 (7 x 120W) A/V Surround Sound Receiver, Sony ES BDP-S5000 Blu-ray disc player, Sony S770 3D Blu-ray disc player, Magnepan 1.7 front speakers, Magnepan CCR center channel, Magnepan MG CC1 surrounds, and two Hsu Research VTF-3 MK3 subwoofers.The most remarkable quality I've found with the television is its theater-like picture.  Verizon FiOS premium channels such as HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax are brilliantly rendered.  DVD and Blu-ray discs are also beautifully shown.  The colors are vibrant and life-like, the images are very crisp, and the depth of field is remarkable.  Sports broadcasting is very clear, and the television imaging is very responsive to fast-paced action, whether in movies or sports broadcasts.Honestly, there is simply nothing I can think of that is lacking in this television.  It has absolutely the most beautiful picture image I have ever seen.  Aesthetically, it is both simple and beautiful.  It seems that Sony hit the ball out of the park on this one.  I highly recommend this television.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Top of the Heap!", "Author": "J. Cordova", "ReviewID": "R19PH5NPQABVE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I give this set 5 stars. I dislike when a review is made and the faults of the product are not discussed. You will be paying $4000 there should not be any surprises. Please do not be confused by what I say in this review, I truly like this set and there IS a Breakin in period. Just keep in mind that the set does need to be adjusted and that the viewing angle does have a fairly defined sweet area, but once on the fringe the picture does wash out (but so do most LCD and LEDs).The remote control leaves a lot to be desired! It is so easy to hit the \"home\" button when making adjustments and then have to start again to complete the adjustment. I bought the 60\" and it replaced my Samsung LN55A950, the extra 5\" made a BIG big difference in viewing real-estate. BTW the 950 (full panel LED) was and still is the best TV I have ever had, as is the Kuro, that said, the Sony has a very natural looking picture. Faces look natural and REDs are perfect.  The picture's \"look\" on the Sony is very much like the Kuro's, but brighter. Now the 3D review...when adjusted well, the picture looks larger with no borders, and fully engages you.What I disliked...Can you believe a 12 month warranty on an XBR with a list price of $5000? A horrid sound output lacking in bass from the speakers. A cheap plastic base stand. And for those of you who have gone thru this...A few days after I bought, Sony came out with a PS3, extra glasses, 3d movie and HDMI cable promotion on it's lesser non XBR model. Such is life!There IS another set to consider and that is the sony xbr 52hx909, but it is 52\" and overpriced. I mention this because some people liked it better than mine.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Dan Rizzi", "ReviewID": "R6KGCW8VU3U11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for 3 months now and am extremely happy with my purchase.  I spent a great deal of time determining which motion flow setting looked best.  I settled on SMOOTH and have used this for almost all viewing programs including sports, network TV, and even movies.  I've seen other TVs with this setting blur action scenes but have not come across this with mine.  I've even had a recent Samsung purchaser at my home who could not believe how good Avatar looked with Smooth setting on.  It basically brings the characters out of the background making it seem like you're watching a documentary in some cases but overall making the characters seem so much more life-like.  You will not believe the difference watching all of your old DVD's and Blu Rays with this feature turned on.  It will not seem like the same movie!  The 240Hz really makes a difference when it comes to Motion Flow.  In case you did not know, Cable and Direct TV output a signal at no greater than 60Hz and most films come on Blu Ray at 24Hz.I have the TV hard wired to a switch and the Internet features on the TV are pretty cool.  I have mostly only used YouTube as I do not use NetFlix yet.  Using the remote control as a keyboard will make you wish they had a bluetooth keyboard when trying to search on YouTube.  I have 4 pairs of 3D glasses and am impressed with the 3D picture.  There are a couple of 3D channels on Direct TV that enable you to use the 3D feature.  It did not make me dizzy and I plan on buying some 3D Blu-Rays once good movies get released in that format. (i.e Avatar, Star Wars).  I don't use the TV speakers instead utilizing the Digital Optical out into an Onkyo Receiver.Upgrading from 40\" to 60\" made a huge difference.  If you're looking at this TV now you may want to take a look at Sony's website as there is a 65\" LED coming out which I believe will have either 480Hz or 960Hz Motion Flow.  The cost is not much different either at the time of this review so I expect this TV to come down significantly by May 2011.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "You Get What You Pay For", "Author": "J. J. Pietrzyk \"Superfly\"", "ReviewID": "RPWNKKDOCSSX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, it cost me an arm and a leg, but I have the most beautiful TV sitting in my living room right now.  I have the TV wired instead of using the wireless option and I absolutely love all the features of the internet direct to the set.  I no longer need to stream Netflix from a game console; it goes straight to the television.  I've used the Sony service to purchase and stream 3D films direct to the television and it works wonderfully.  This is the absolute clearest resolution I have ever seen and the Super Bowl was a real treat in HD.  The 3D is outstanding and I play 3D blurays from my PS3.  The only issue is you will need a new sound system that can run the new HDMI 1.4 so sound and picture can run through the same HDMI cable to the rest of your audio system.Motionflow will absolutely freak you out.  It makes the picture look realistic almost to a fault because you won't be used to it.  Put in your favorite movie and switch Motionflow on and off during action scenes to see what I mean.The only bad thing about a Sony is that when the next greatest tech comes out the resale value of this TV will be nowhere near the $4000+ I paid for it, but such is life.  If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them!", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony XBR 60", "Author": "Gonzo", "ReviewID": "R2V1IZK7HITY4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony XBR 60 is truly an amazement.  My wife and I have sat awestruck these last two weeks, watching this television.  The depth of clarity, edge sharpness, color brilliance, dynamic movement and 3D all come together in this unit.  I put the IMAX program on the Space Station on with 3D and was instantly transported into space.  It's a wonder.  My wife, at first objected to the size of the unit.  Well, she's not objecting any more.  It really does give you a home theater experience...at home!There are some negatives, but these relate more to what is possible, technically. The sound on the TV itself is poor due to the fact that it's near impossible to situate speakers on a thin TV.  This is easily remedied by purchasing the very reasonably priced Blue Ray sound system.  The wearing of the 3D glasses is a bit of an annoyance as you've got to keep your head vertical in relation to the TV.  I know they're all working on the next iteration of 3D coming soon, however, there will always be restrictions with viewing angle when watching 3D, unless they come up with a totally different technology.In summary, yes, this is the TV to get.  It surpasses anything I've seen in stores.  It's really a reference monitor for pro's.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony XBR60LX900 3D 240Hz LED HDTV", "Author": "dkb50", "ReviewID": "R14WQ61CR16CIP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have searched for the best 3D TV for 3-4 months, reading all reviews, going to the stores and watching the picture in 3D. This is the best TV on the market today, nothing compares with it, regardless if you are looking for 3D or not.. Regular TV picture quality is the same as putting in a Blu-Ray disc. I love this TV..

I agree with other reviewers that you need an add-on surround sound to really bring audio up to the quality of the picture.  I also recommend the best HDMI cable you can justify as the quality of the cable is reflected in the picture, especially in using blu-ray and 3D.  I have a copy of Avatar 3D  blue ray and viewed on this television it is the most amazing experience.  Better than the theater even . I love the little extras like having incoming phone calls display onscreen and the selections in picture attentuation when you watch sports versus a concert.  Picture quality is outstanding .  Sports events live in 3D broadcast TV are really cool.  I can recall back in the day watching certaain programs solely because they were in color. Now, on this Sony, I find myself watching sporting events I noprmally am not interested in because the viewing experience in 3D is so cool. With this set, I replaced a rear projection big screen Sony that was one of the earlier HD sets (720p) The only thing I miss is \"picture-in-picture\"  But for the quality of this set, that is a miniscule quibble.  This set is now discontinued and you'll have to go to either the 64\" or downsize to the 54.6\"  to get the XBR Bravia now.  These sets are expensive but worth the price in the pleasure in viewing they provide. I highly recommend them.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome TV!", "Author": "M.
