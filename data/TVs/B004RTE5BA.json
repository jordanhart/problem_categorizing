{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Near Perfection", "Author": "TheBigB", "ReviewID": "RP7WLLYT3XNTU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this beast of a plasma for about a month now and I am truly still being blown away.  Like other reviewers, I was on the fence about Panasonic versus Samsung. I also wanted something OVER 60 inches, and plasma was the way to go to keep costs reasonable.  It was either a Panasonic VT65 or GT65 or the Samsung D8000 or D7000.  I read countless point and counterpoint discussions on the AVForum site for months...And when I saw a great deal on this 64D8000 I jumped on it and am totally pleased with my choice.PICTURE: Unbelievable.. Out of the box, it was amazing.  Midnight blacks and bright clean whites.. I mean watching the Boston Bruins play in the Stanley Cup was the first thing I saw when I had this on...the black shirts contrasted against the white ice was amazing. Close ups of the Bruins uniforms looked like the TV was powered off on that part of the screen. Really great. Blu-rays of course looked even better. Again the blacks stood out and colors really popped...TRON: Legacy looked UN-believable!!!  Just when I thought I'd seen it all, I went into advanced options in the menu and entered a professional calibration result from a tester on AVForum.  It took awhile entering in all those R G B settings, but it was totally worth it. (Saved me a couple hundred I'm sure)  After my \"calibration\", I saw the true power of this Samsung.  The colors came alive.  And the contrast and flesh tones became more realistic.  Blacks were inky (definitely a popular but very true word to describe these blacks) and even darker than before!  So, before I thought the picture was amazing, but now it was near perfection!  I honestly can't see how even the wildly popular, overpriced Panasonic VT series can beat this...(according to CNet reviews, they BARELY edge out this tv in picture quality).  But you won't be disappointed with this Samsung.  I'm no TV expert but I've had lots of HDTVs the last decade, and keep up with the latest.  Plasmas aren't going away anytime soon... This is a big, bright, beautiful beast.  Even more beautiful if you calibrate it, or \"calibrate\" it on your own.DESIGN:  Very nice looking, when turned off.  The dark titanium bezel is attractive (darker than the picture shown here on Amazon) with a nice glass edge to give it that classy look.  The stand, I agree, is kind of ugly with it's chrome spider legs..but you gotta hang this thing anyway.  This thing is meant to hang on the wall.  Its surprisingly thin for a 64-inch plasma.  The screen is a bit reflective so it looks nice when it's off, but plan accordingly if you want this in a room with lots of windows.  The reflections will be noticeable.  The remote has a nice Qwerty keypad for entering text, and I actually like it's flip design...although that keypad should light up! It's useless in the dark.  There is an app to use on a smartphone that I have yet to try.3D:  I've only watched Directv 3D channels, so I haven't gotten a lot of 3D experience yet (no Blu-ray 3D yet either even though I'm ready for it). What I have watched is nice.  I got two free pairs of battery powered glasses and one rechargeable pair that I paid for extra.  The 3D is fun to watch and clear in HD. It is still a gimmick in my book, and I can only watch so much of it before I get annoyed.  Bottom line, 3D on this tv looks good (dimmer, but still clear and nice) but I bought this for its 2D picture...  3D is nice to have though, and I'm looking forward to trying out a 3D Blu-ray sometime soon..SMART TV:  Like the 3D feature this is nice. But not necessary in my book. I still use a computer for Internet features and YouTube videos, not my TV. That being said, I think the layout of this Internet connectivity is nice and smooth.  Not as smooth as a computer or iPad but it works well enough. And it has built in wifi, so I had to try it out. I was impressed, and I have occasionally gone back to this for sports scores or a YouTube video once in awhile. Samsung has done better than I would have guessed with this \"Smart TV\" thing...I imagine some people, not myself really, will get a lot of use out of this..NEGATIVES:  okay, so this not perfect. There are a couple things I will point out that people will surely notice. First is the reflective screen.  I notice it even in my window-less downstairs room when lights are on and the scene on TV is dark... This TV is meant to be viewed in a darkened room with minimal light.  Second, if you've read up on plasmas then you've heard about \"buzzing\".  Apparently, Samsung has had buzzing issues before. I tried to notice this right away but couldn't. Then during a quiet scene of a movie, I sat dead center in front of this tv and happened to turn my head away from the screen and heard it.  Now, to be clear, this is not a loud \"buzzing\" sound and I'm not even complaining about it, but if you are dead center in front of the TV in a quiet scene and you turn your head (directing your ear towards the screen) AND you listen for it, you can hear an ever-so-faint \"ticking\" sound.  I can't imagine many people would complain but I know some will... And lastly, again if you've read up on this model, you may hear about the anti-glare screen coating peeling away on the top corners.  I have to say, that my two top corners are just BARELY peeling (or not completely sticking) at the tips.. It was like this when I got it and it doesn't even reach the actual picture or affect it in any way, so again I'm not complaining and I'm not messing with it. But if it happens to get any worse I would certainly be calling Samsung on this known issue. As it is now, it doesn't hinder my high opinion of this TV and is only noticeable if you get real close and look.OVERALL:  I got this for a big, bold, picture and solid design and I'm not disappointed in the least. Blu-rays are unreal!  Sports look better than I could have imagined.  And 3D and SMART TV features are a nice occasional option.  And despite those couple flaws which do NOT directly bother me at all, this is near perfection.  9.5 out of 10 from me.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Could not be happier", "Author": "coselect", "ReviewID": "R332BYCZ5KOV6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I just purchased the pn51d8ooo about a week ago from Paul's TV. I would have bet that we were going to walk out of the store with a led/lcd model. The salesman was extremely helpful with explaining the attributes of the models we were considering. He eventually steered us towards this model for consideration. It seemed strange to me that since they work on commission at this store he would try to sell us on the plasma (less expensive than the comparable led/lcd), it soon became clear that this salesman (Nick)not only knew what he was talking about but wanted us to get the best product for the money. This model is more full featured than anything else out there. It has full web browsing capabilities (yes, that's right - you can actually surf the net, buy from ebay or Amazon, google anything etc., etc.) There is a built in wireless card unlike all of the others we saw which required you to buy a dongle or other accessory. The picture in the showroom was awesome. Although not as brightly lit as the led models, the colors seemed more natural to me. the blacks were richer (when viewing from an angle the led blacks turned more gray than black). We paid $2,069.00 which included the starter 3D kit (two pair of glasses and five 3D movies). The remote is awesome, a standard tv remote on one side but flip it over and you have a full qwerty keyboard and other keys which make internet surfing so much easier. I do have to say that my wife was concerned that we would not like the plasma as much as we would have liked the intense brightness of the led model.After getting the TV home we took a few days to set it up because we were waiting on a new console stand. I took that time to run a network ethernet cable to the tv location (wired is always faster and more reliable than wireless, but I'm sure that the wireless signal would have worked fine). Set-up was a breeze, stand mounts to tv easily, switching between apps, tv, and internet was very intuitive. We were concerned that we might need to have the tv picture calibrated (as recommended by other stores for $199.00 additional), but were thrilled with the picture right out of the box. There are four picture modes (Dynamic, standard, movie and relax), we are using dynamic which is extremely close to the brightness of the led models. The sound is more than adequate for us. With the wired internet, the set took literally 30 seconds to connect successfully. The netflix problems that I have read in one or two other reviews must have been resolved because I have not had even one glitch. The apps are great but there is a bit of a quirky apps account registration you have to get through. All in all we are extremely happy with our purchase. I haven't tried the 3D yet but it has full 3D and I'm sure we will love it when more 3D titles are available. Hope this long winded review helps. p.s. We purchased the five year service agreement just to have the peace of mind that it offers, we had a smaller lcd previously that we had to have repaired and it was a bit expensive.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "After years of dragging feet, this TV made me JUMP to HD...", "Author": "Nathaniel Allen", "ReviewID": "R2NWERT3HWOGEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...although I should thank Amazon Warehouse for first sending me a busted-up 50\" version of last year's C8000 or I may never have experienced the awesomeness of the 59\" D8000!The great (and exhaustive) information at AVSFourm lead me to this beauty, which I purchased from BuyDig due to Amazon Warehouse hanging me up on a C8000 replacement, and then Amazon taking forever to get the new 2011 Samsungs into inventory and listed for sale. I've got mine paired up with a Samsung BD-D6700 3D Blu-ray Player using AmazonBasics High Speed HDMI Cable. I wall mounted the set with a Sanus Vlt14-B1 Super-Slim Tilt Mount bracket. I'm using Samsung's SSG-3100GB 3D Glasses that came as part of the Shrek/Megamind 3D Starter Kit, which was included as a promotional item with this set.Regarding picture quality: - Simply outstanding. Crisp definition. True colors that aren't overly bright or artificial. Inky black blacks. - No ghosting or shadows. Great with fast action and camera panning. Haven't tried video games. - No sign of jutter or film effect; the high refresh rate makes any motion smooth and realistic, especially noticeable in-store when comparing this side-by-side with a lower refresh TV. - Not so hot as a PC monitor with respect to reading tiny text.If you're worried about the size possibly being too big: - I thought I was pushing my luck after my wife commented that the broken 50\" C8000 that showed up at our front door (but was never mounted) looked \"too big.\" And I'll admit, this 59\" TV is huge, but once we sat back to enjoy it, I don't know how we suffered (*cough, cough*) with out 32\" Trinitron tube for the past 14 years. - With whatever up-convert happens between our DVD player and the TV itself, standard definition movies still look fine on this set. No, they're not as amazingly crystal clear as high-def Blu-ray content, but they're not at all blocky as I had expected. - You will want to take advantage of any HD cable, satellite or over-the-air broadcasts you might have available. Standard definition television picture quality will make you crazy after knowing the cleanliness of HD. (In our case, we're sticking with Comcast's most basic service but added their converter box, and are paying them about $28 per month.) - The VESA mounting pattern on the back is 800mm x 600mm, the largest size the Sanus mount I linked to supports. It's probably worth checking that whatever mount you select is compatible with this pattern.3D movies on this set are simply outstanding. So far, I've only got the Shrek discs that came with Samsung's starter kit to view, though I've got a couple more on the way. The big screen gives a really perceptible depth effect when viewed from my normal sitting position approximately 10 feet away. But we have a wide room and even from viewing angles of 45\u00b0 the effect is still present with only very minor drop-offs in color and brightness (the picture noticeably dims once the 3D glasses are powered on, especially when the room is bright).3D setup and playback is a cinch -- the sync signal is bluetooth, so each pair of glasses needs to be paired the first time used. Pairing involves nothing more than turning the glasses on, and since the bluetooth signal is bi-directional, the television recognizes when the glasses are activated and provides a brief pop-up indication in the lower left corner saying so.After that initial setup, inserting a 3D disk and pressing play is all that's required to get the show going. The TV even automatically powers on and switches to the correct input when I power up my Samsung player and insert a disk.During the day I've watched my movies with the bright overhead lights on, and daylight lighting the room through two large windows. The anti-reflective coating on the screen is excellent! There's no apparent glare, and the brightness of the screen even at the factory setting (if I recall correctly, it's initially set at brightness level 48) is more than enough overcome this ambient light, without washing out the deep, dark black levels. (The 3D glasses reflect lighted surfaces located directly behind my head; in this case a darker room is preferred lest I need to fashion side-shades for the glasses.) In a dark room, the picture is simply jaw-dropping.Even the built-in speakers of this set do an adequate job of getting the sound out. Fine in a pinch, but I think you'll agree it's no match for amping the audio through an AV receiver to external speakers (in our case, a Denon AVR-3311CI which supports HDMI 1.4a and 3D pass-through.)Samsung's QWERTY remote is really a huge leap forward from a standard numeric remote, but is slow and slightly awkward in use. The two-sided remote resembles a conventional numbers-only device on one side, beaming our traditional infrared signals. The keyboard side takes advantage of the D8000's bluetooth, and is therefore only compatible with the television, and not the Samsung DVD player, nor any other device.  The keyboard side of the remote even has a usable thumb sensor -- sort of like a track pad on a Blackberry or a thumb control on a laptop keyboard -- allowing easy cursor navigation of the built-in web browser and applications.However, try as they might, the remote + SmartTV web apps still leave a bit to be desired when compared to a PC interface. For instance, sites like Hulu and NBC won't play Flash video (which I was aware of prior to purchase). So instead, I connect my laptop via Siig's USB to HDmi adapter to watch broadcast TV shows, and will switch to a PC with a HDMI-out video card sometime in the future.The television's Netflix capabilities are solid. My one gripe is that once I locate and begin watching a movie, but then pause it and return to finish it on a different day, it has taken me quite a bit of searching to re-find it. But once I do, it resumes where I left off, and all of the expected pause, fast forward and rewind functions work as expected. However, once inside the Netflix app, I'm locked out of accessing the television's menu, so I lose the ability to adjust picture (and audio, if using the TV speakers).There are a number of redundant SmartTV features between the television and my Samsung DVD player, and if it were truly \"smart,\" might it not somehow combine these Samsung web apps so that I'm only dealing with one Netflix, one YouTube, one browser, etc.? Because it sure would be nice to use the QWERTY remote on everything, including Pandora, which (I believe) isn't available as an application on the television. As it is, each application has its own login process, with the Netflix process being quite different from Pandora or YouTube, for instance.The YouTube app needs improvement. It doesn't make use of the remote's QWERTY keypad, and instead requires the user to use the cursor buttons to scroll around the on-screen virtual keyboard to conduct a video search. Instead, I use the TV's built-in web browser to access YouTube, which works pretty well, even in full-screen mode.The most desirable part of the Facebook app would be the photo viewer, which for some inexplicable reason won't take advantage of the full screen size -- even for photos that were uploaded at full resolution. This makes showing off baby and vacation pictures a bit of a yawner. The photos tend to be small and a little washed out, though easy to navigate between albums. The rest of the Facebook application is cumbersome to navigate, read and update, and never seems to fully load.One last comment, regarding some criticism I've read regarding the television's silver bezel: it really isn't a stand-out issue. In a dark room, you'll never see it. In a lighted room, it doesn't pop out to me like it does in the product shots shown here and on other sites. It really is a flat finish that doesn't reflect back a whole lot of light, it blends nicely with the glass overlay, and isn't something I'm ever conscious of.Samsung has put together a really nice television here at an attractive price, packed with lots of features and a stunning picture. I simply can't imagine anything to complain about and enthusiastically recommend anyone looking to check one of these out at a local electronics store to be wowed by its brilliance.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Auto Dim problem out of the Box but still a good TV.", "Author": "RadTech51", "ReviewID": "R1VYD02YKDKQL5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok first I want to make it clear this is a great looking TV but requires some adjustment out of the box.I seems to be an Auto Dim problem with several of the Samsung TV's including this new PN64D8000 Plasma TV.When I'm watching a movie or any other program for that matter I notice a very annoying Auto Diming of the picture as if someone had just taken my remote control and changed the display setting during a scene. This happens very often and not just during the credits where it's very obvious but also during the program, I can't seem to disable it no matter what I do. Its appears to be more noticeable in a darker room and I don't know why I didn't notice it sooner but now that I do It's become very distracing to me and I notice it all the time. I even had to stop the picture I was viewing last night to try to figure out a way to disable this very annoying Auto Dim problem, of course I had No success.During my research into the problem I found several articles about this issue mostly on forums, and it's apparently on other Samsung models as well. I even found an article linking this issue with some Sony TV's.I called Samsung and all they told me was to turn the ECO Sensor to Off.  Others said to work around this problem you need to put the TV into Game Mode and turning the Energy Saving and Dynamic Contrast feature to Off. Note: this only creates another problems with performance arguably worse then the original issue. Some others even referred to editing the service menu and disabling the  CE DIMMING feature. Note:  But I was told this would void our manufacture warrantee and also create other problems with the display, noticeably with leaking backlighting on dark scenes.Conclusion: Samsung's advice is the best answer for now until a better fix is made. I tested it by disabling the  CE DIMMING feature and it appears to help the issue greatly on my D8000 Plasma, not sure about completly though but it is a noticable improvement. Note: I can't say if this will work on other Samsung TV modles, I will continue testing my D8000 more with this feature turned Off but for now this is my only solution for you. Turn the CE DIMMING feature to OFF.  Menu > Picture > ECO Solution > to Off.F.Y.I you will notice a big difference in brightness to the picture quality when this feature is turned Off. And shame on Samsung for setting this feature to On by default.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "pretty picture, horrible buzzing", "Author": "gls", "ReviewID": "R2XK8USCEOZM5S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV has a great picture.  Deep, deep blacks, very accurate color.  3D is awesome (and the glasses are reasonably priced as compared to Panasonic's).  One draw back to the picture quality is the TV's habit of fluctuating the overall brightness.  Some people refer to it as brightness pop.  If you are watching a bluray in 1080/24p mode, this fluctuation can be reduced somewhat by turning on Cinema Smooth.  As a side note, the Panasonic plasmas do this as well (I witnessed it on both brands at a brick and mortar store).  But Panasonic is attempting to address the problem by updating firmware and changing hardware, while Samsung seems to be ignoring it.  One other drawback to the deep blacks is that while they are some of the deepest I've seen, the shadow detail is somewhat lacking.  For example, if a person is wearing a black suit in a dark room, sometimes the form of their body is indistinguishable from the background (its as if their head is floating).  Or if someone is wearing black and a black car passes behind them in the background, the two shapes kind of merge.  These are both acceptable shortcomings of the TV when considering the wonderful overall picture quality.  What is not acceptable is the buzzing.  The entire glass screen seems to act like a speaker projecting a high pitched buzz that changes frequency with ambient brightness of the scene.  If the viewer sits off center from the TV, the buzz is almost an acceptable level.  However, if the viewer is sitting in front of the screen (even as far as 4 meters away), the volume of the buzz is so high that it is unacceptable. It completely kills the mood of a quiet scene in a good movie.  It's unwatchable at night because volume has to be way up to overcome the buzz.  I've adjusted every setting on the TV in an effort to decrease the buzz.  Even with all of the brightness and luminosity settings all the way down, the buzz in unacceptable.  I'm not the only one that has complained about the samsung buzz, there are entire forums dedicated to it.  This is not the typical buzz of a plasma that most plasma fanboys will claim is just a feature of the plasma technology that you overlook to get superior picture.  I've watched other plasmas and they don't buzz to this degree. I did take a trip to several stores to see if I could hear floor models buzz.  I could not in most cases (in one case I did hear a faint buzz if I had my head next to the TV).  But I have a feeling that this is not a good test due to the loud ambient noise in most stores.  With much regret, I've decided to return this beautiful TV and shop some more.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "BETTER than panasonic, better color, inky blacks, perfect tv!!", "Author": "electric6", "ReviewID": "R2G9H7OCRTLB6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will say first off that I am not a proffessional TV guy. I do not have a device to measure MLL, or light output.That being said, I researched exhaustively as my little 37\" Diamond series was getting a little small. For 3-4 months I had my heart set on the P65VT30, preordered at J&R.; Then I started reading reviews by cnet, and other pros on the web about their previous sets. Blacks levels on pannys WILL degrade. That rating on their site which says it has better blacks will change, they will degrade over time, and very likely to a point worse than this set. I do not care how many people say that the VT30 has better blacks because 4300 dollars is just not worth it for a set that has worse color, temporarily better blacks, and a vizio-esque blocky design.I cancelled my VT30 preorder shortly after reading review after review regarding the above issue. It is due to how the set adjusts brightness, and is just the way those sets work - the issue is unavoidable, so don't say I didnt tell you so when you notice while watching the super bowl later this year and the steelers jerseys are not as black as they once were!Now the samsung PN64D8000 is about as good as you're going to get on a big screen pdp display - blacks ARE better on this set than the smaller ones, which I will address later. Blacks are Inky!! And I use that term because that is the most applicable word I can think of. Colors are delicious, with reds, greens, yellows, and blues all popping right off the screen and into your living room. I play a lot of HD games on ps3/360 and the first thing I noticed is how well the set responds to fast moving images. It is spot on, and at least twice as fast as my old LCD set was. Gaming on this TV is an absolute pleasure, and I cant stand it on my old mitsu anymore, as my eyes have become accustomed to nearly perfect response time.On to BD's. I have read conflicting reports of Cinema Smooth degrading blacks when turned on. I have not seen this one solitary instance. I watched the Matrix Reloaded twice - the first time with CS on, the second with it off. Blacks did not decrease any that I could notice, and I have a good eye for detail. Yes, CS mode does improve PQ on bluray movies, and quite a bit I might add. The picture, for lack of a better word, just seems more \"together.\" More details can be seen with CS mode on than off. This feature is really personal preference, but for me it improves an already amazing picture to a pq I have literally not seen before on a TV. This mode is what videophiles call the \"96hz mode\". Technically means that turned on CS will match the 24fps, with that of the bd, which greatly improves pq. Modern films are filmed at 24fps, and CS mode basically matches that, by reducing from 60fps to 24fps using 96hz mode. Techno-babble I know, but moving on.Netflix. We've all got it, and we've all seen the input signal change mid-way through a movie much to our annoyance. It shows up even worse on a big hd set. Here is where I have one of my few complaints: while whatching netflix I have seen in only a few instances some mild fluctuating blacks. I'm not sure if it is due to the picture source(netflix) or the tv's processing. I'm still trying to figure it out.I have seen FB only one other time. On the BD of Interview with the Vampire the blacks did fluctuate a few times, and if I was not so obsessed with detail I would not have noticed it. Its really a small issue, and most folks will probably not see it like some of us tech heads do. NOTE: Samsung did release an update for this tv, and after installation I watched the IWTV again. This time I did not see FB's. None.The only time I EVER see fluctuating blacks now is when netflix is on a low quality for whatever reason. It only seems to happen when watching poorer quality signals like sd cable, or netflix, so really nothing to worry about.My review is mainly regarding picture quality, and ive got a tower for my internet. That being said, the internet on the tv is ok. A little laggy sometimes, but its bearable. Netflix straight through the tv is quite acceptable, and at least as good as from a ps3/360. Netflix through the ps3 has been the best overall, if it makes any difference(1080p streaming).Overall I would give this set a 9/10 just because the stand is so darn ugly, the bezel is not black like the d7000 and the few instances I saw FB's. Blacks are amazing, inky, and you will notice them the first time you turn it on. Colors are spot on!! Response time is absolutely fantastic, and despite what those 18 year olds at best buy say, plasma is far superior for gaming. Burn-in is a thing of yesteryear, and there is absolutely no issues with that on this set. I would take this set over the Panasonic P65VT30 ANY DAY!! Samsung is better with parts distribution, service, warranty claims(not that you will have any), and over picture quality. Blacks are videophiles obsessions, and this set does them perfectly.So when you pull out your credit card for the VT30, just remember \"i told you so\" when youre cursing at your set come super bowl time, or neo's trench coat isnt as black as it used to be...Hope this helps with your decision!Thanks for reading guys.Ryan", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best picture I have ever seen!", "Author": "Atlasfxr", "ReviewID": "R3J82TKMLK63TJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This picture is so good that you can see the makeup cover-up on the actors' zits, blades of grass and any imperfections that exist on a local news set.

I chose the PN59D8000 plasma for my main TV due to its superior 3D performance compared to LED LCDs.  I've lived with it for about a month, so can't comment on long-term reliability, but my previous Samsung LCD & DLP HDTVs had no problems over several years.The picture on this TV is amazing - easily among the best that I have seen among all other plasmas.  Blacks are very black and the color can quickly be adjusted from fairly intense (dynamic) to muted (movie) by the standard pre-sets.  As usual, there are multiple picture adjustments that can tailor the picture to one's exact preference.The 3D image is very good, with no ghosting and with very good depth.  Samsung moved this year to Bluetooth shutter glasses and this makes a world of difference.  My previous experience with IR shutter glasses from several manufacturers required that one not move around much (or even look around the room).  Now I can wander into the kitchen for popcorn and still be seamlessly in synch when I return to the TV.Sound is OK and includes a pseudo-surround sound setting, but I run sound output run through my home theater receiver, so I can't really comment.The PN59D8000 is among Samsung's net-enabled \"Smart TVs\" which gives you access to a lot of apps as well as a net browser.  I have the TV connected via ethernet, so I can't comment on the quality of the wireless access, but the ethernet connection works very well for most apps.  Any problems with connectivity appear to be due to Comcast (since any problems seem to be shared with my computer).  The QWERTY side of the remote works as advertised, but does take a little getting used to.  **** An important note:  For the initial pairing process for the remote, make sure that you hold the remote directly in front of the TV (as in 5\" or so) or it will fail to pair properly.  Once paired, however, it works all over the room.  My only complaint is that the browser seems vvvveeeerrrryyy slow.Finally, Samsung has moved to an \"e-manual\" (even including a specific button on the remote labeled \"E-MANUAL\") rather than including a detailed paper manual.  A major advantage is that it is easily searchable (as contrasted with the poor and inadequate index seen in most paper manuals) and can be constantly updated if accessed over the net.

Black colors are very dark, inky for my first time. 24fps, 1080P full HD is what it does best. 3D is better than what I was expecting. Apps are cool and launch pretty quickly. Off angle viewing is good, better than my older LCD.Cons: Pricey. Qwerty keyboard remote is funky, a little awkward. Browser needs improvement. 3D requires glasses, wish they didn't. Plasma uses more power than LCD.Summary: I have owned my PN59D8000 for about two weeks now. So far it's been excellent to good. First the excellent; the picture. This is what it's all about to me. What's the point of getting a new TV if it doesn't produce a great picture. The PN59D8000 makes a great picture. I'm no Cnet David Katzmaier, I haven't seen hundreds of TV's, but I do know what I like when I see it and I think this TV makes a very good, to great picture. I really enjoy watching a good, well made, high visual content movie in full 1080P HD, 24fps. I have watched standard def, 1080 I/P HD and high def 3D. The standard def is good, better than my older 52\" A650 Samsung LCD in several ways, but no matter how you cut it, it's still standard def. The HD picture is what it's all about, it's excellent, with blacks so dark and inky, the best I've seen so far. The contrast and detail is excellent. Very smooth transitions, panning. 3D is cool, different, awkward. At first, I tried watching some ESPN 3D NBA (Directv) during the daytime in a well lit room & I really noticed the flashing, pulsing of the 3D glass lenses off screen of the TV from the sides. To me this was a little nauseating, but during night or with the curtains closed in a dark or darker room, the effect was very good and comfortable. The 3D depth and detail was excellent, better than what I was expecting actually. I now wish that there would be more good 3D content available, kind of limited. The Good; the browser and qwerty keyboard is a little bit of a let down, but still good. I have a Home Theater PC with a hand held qwerty remote, at first I thought that setup was only OK, but compared to the Samsung qwerty remote/browser, the Windows 7/IE9/Firefox browser is really much better. Who would have thought.  The Samsung browser is good, to get online and putz around, but the remote needs a touch-pad/trackball big time. The Samsung commercial showing the couple just breezing through web pages is a little unreal to me. Maybe with more practice and understanding I could be more proficient. Your mileage may vary. The Samsung apps are cool and launch quickly. Netflix pops up quickly and plays smoothly. Wired Ethernet here. 5 star picture. 1/2 a star ding for the browser/remote. 4 1/2 stars overall. The other TV's that I was considering were the new upcoming 2011 Panasonic plasma's. The 2010 Panasonic VT model plasma are very good as well, but at this moment the 2011 VT model is not out yet and the 60\" VT appear to be too expensive for my budget. So there it is, a LCD owner converting to Plasma, because of the picture, because of the picture.

I feel if I have to shell out over 3k for a high tech gadget, it might as well be perfect or near perfect.  Let me exhale and say, that the search is finally over...I hope.To make a long story short, I have owned 6 different HDTV's in the past 6 months.  Some of them had annoying buzzing/humming sounds, others had blurriness when viewing fast motion scenes. And even others just didn't even turn on right out of the box !It really came down to this model or the highly anticipated Panasonic 64 inch VT30.  I owned the Panasonic model for about a week before I got annoyed by the loud clicking/humming noise during dark scenes and whenever I changed the channel.  It was also a hefty price tag of over 4k.  The glasses for the Panasonic also made me nauseous.I got this PN64D8000 @ Magnolia TV instead when it included the 3D starter kit in addition to a free 3D blu ray player.The picture is simply stunning!!!  It is crisp for both for blu-rays and when I watch channels on Direct TV.  When watching sports, there is virtually no blur during fast motion scenes, a prerequisite for me, since I watch tons of hockey and the likes.  I was just thinking that the HD content on this TV is so clear, my eyes almost hurt!! I'm half joking!  Even popping in a movie such as the Guardian on standard DVD, the picture looks like its in HD!The 3D content is tremendous when watching the Shrek movies.  The colors are rich and vibrant, and for me the glasses were very comfortable and didn't make me nauseous at all, unlike Panasonic's glasses.Trust me when I say, if I don't like a TV I return it, as mentioned above.  I have had this TV for over 2 weeks now and continue to be amazed.  My roommate is even raving about the resolution on it.The only negative thing, I can live with and not to bothered by is the initial buzz when the TV turns on.  After about a few mins the buzz goes away.  Either way, due to the fact it is a plasma and it is a large screen TV, I don't think there's a way around the slight noise.  But like I said, this sound is acceptable and barely noticeable to me.  And I am extremely picky!!!Buy, if you have the funds.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "LED vs Plasma", "Author": "Just4kicks", "ReviewID": "R253QE4ZP0KJT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has been a long journey, but I have finally found my TV. I do not claim to be a TV expert. This review is strictly my personal opinion. I started with the Samsung UN55D8000 LED, which is the Flagship model for Samsung's 2011 LED line up. I tried it for 3 weeks, the picture quality is the absolute best you will see for 2011. The UN55d8000 has the best colors and the razor thin bezel creates a fantastic 3d image. However, if you enjoy fast frames the LED is not for you. Samsung touts the \"Motion Plus\" feature, but the feature just connects old frames, with new; nothing in between. If your not a big sports fan, get the LED for sure. The PS3 with game mode on is absolutely amazing. COD black ops was a whole new experience with 3d. The regular HD picture was perfect... Then I would turn on sports center and feel terrible about my LED purchase. Again, if your not a sports fan, or only watch sports occasionally and have the money, do yourself a favor and get the best picture on the market with the UN55D8000. You should be eligible for 4 3d glasses if you buy the UN55D8000. You receive 2 as part of a promotion, and 2 from a mail in rebate.Now, onto the pn59d8000. The colors are almost as good as the UN55d8000 LED. I think with some fine tuning I can get the colors closer to LED quality. The 600 HZ with 25,000,000 : 1 contrast creates a smooth, colorful, dark picture. You get 2 3d glasses as part of a promotion. This TV might not produce the colors that the LED does, but the fact is, I can only look at so many plants and flowers until the game comes on and I say to my wife \" alright... the game is on...?!?!?!?\". Then its lights, camera, action. This plasma outperforms in every aspect when judging precise fast movements when watching sports. Catching something the first time before the ref's do is always a good time. PS3 games are a little darker than the LED but when game mode is \"on\" its almost perfect. The 3d was not as breathtaking as the LED with Blu ray movies. But with PS3 games in 3d, games were as good if not better with the pn59.Pros pn59: Smooth picture, great colors, fantastic performance all around.Cons pn59: Colors do not pop like a LED.Summary: All in all as a hole in a hole. It really depends on what you want out of your TV. I know that is not very helpful but that's really what it boils down to. Until someone makes a 600 hz LED. I will be using Plasma. I love watching sports and occasionally playing video games.

However upon setup there was a buzzing sound, loudest when watching from the middle of the set and quiet from the sides.  It was so loud I had to turn the volume to around 15 to suppress the buzz.  This is much louder than I normally watch TV and during any quiet scene the buzzing returned ruining shows and movies.  I called samsung and they recommended a technician come out for repair.  I then called Amazon and they were great exchanging the TV with a brand new set on the same day as broken TV's pickup.Plasma TV #2Same problem.  Loud buzz.  Had family in town as well who all heard it as well.  Called Amazon the following day and asked for refund.  Again I have no complaints about ordering from Amazon.  Their service was great.  Also the TV showed no signs of external damage.  This is a problem with this model.This has been extremely frustrating and I would not recommend this TV until it is confirmed that this is no longer an issue.  Again picture great and looks fantastic in the room but utterly unwatchable.Hope this helps others.  I do not typically write reviews but after this process I thought others should be made aware.  Also I researched this TV prior to purchase and saw others had had this problem but thought it was a minority of sets....The primary online resource I used to research this problem was AVS forums.  Also went to a local store to examine the set again(did this prior to purchase as well) and the floor model they had was not emitting this noise.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable!

At first, I was a bit upset because the picture on that TV was just beautiful, but I knew that I had to return it or risk the blinking issue progressively getting worse as time passed. Anyway, although I was worried that the TV couldn't perform as well as my C8000, I must say that this TV greatly improved on its picture! It seems brighter than my PN63C8000 (even with my cell light only at 10 right now), and the way it handles motion is incredible. I've had it for only a couple days and I can't wait to get home and turn it on again! I actually turned it on before going to work this morning just to see the amazing picture before I left (Call me a dork/nerd now, but you'll understand if you see this beauty in person!)Funny fact - I have been watching a certain sports station every day on my C8000 set, and when I turned on this station from my D8000 I couldn't believe the difference! The poor woman on there looked much older because I can see so many more fine wrinkles on her face! Amazing! Don't get me wrong, the C8000 is a great set, but I definitely noticed an improvement within minutes of watching this TV! You can read all the reviews you want but you will not be able to truly appreciate and understand the picture quality until you see it in person! Note - I don't have any buzzing or screen peeling issues that affected the earlier manufactured panels (mine was manufactured Aug 19, 2011).I haven't tried the 3D yet, but I heard and read that it's incredible. It worked well on the PN63C8000, so I'm anxious to see if I notice any significant improvements. I also tried the internet browser for a bit and I must say that it is pretty nice. It will take some time to get totally used to it, but having this feature readily available on your TV (think of checking Fantasy Football scores!!) is pretty cool and a nice upgrade from last year!Everyone and anyone who has done his/her research to find the TV with the best picture quality and features knows that for the second straight year it is between Samsung's D8000 Plasma and Panasonic's VT30 plasma. You will most likely be very happy with either one, but I strongly believe the D8000 easily set itself apart from the VT30 because of its superior color accuracy, sleek design, array of features, helpful customer support, and overall value. You will probably be very happy with the VT30, but I am absolutely thrilled with the PN64D8000! You cannot go wrong here! I strongly suggest you get the 64\" size too if you have the money and the room for it because you won't have to wonder a couple weeks or months later if you should have gone with the bigger model (because that answer would likely be a \"Yes, you idiot!\" Not to mention, the bigger panels have been shown to be producing deeper/superior black levels.To sum it up, I have already done all the research and all the comparisons that one could possibly do before making the purchase. Take it from me and do yourself a big favor...SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND BUY THE PN64D8000!!!

Most noticeable on menus (netflix splash screen was horrible every time), scenes with a white window in the panoramic view, etc.  Absolutely intolerable during quiet or silent moments.  It got to the point where I could not even enjoy the content that was not buzzing because I was constantly listening for buzzing noises.  Web browser was buzzing (anyone who enjoys using the web browser feature on any 8000 series must be out of his or her mind, it's awful).  I probably left out other examples of buzzing/noises.  If you browse around forums etc. you will find several buzzing reports so this has been a recurring QC issue for Samsung.  Maybe it will improve in 2012, but the current solution is to purchase a good LED set.  Nothing great about the TV could have offset the annoying intermittent buzzing sounds.  Replaced with an LED and it is quiet as a mouse.  It's not worth playing trial and error on plasma.  Still battling with a return on this.One other thing I forgot to add to this was that the controller had some problems and it was not a very well designed device.  A couple times the controller would not turn the tv off.  Even if the samsung remote operated without a hitch, it is easier to operate a remote that you can feel the primary button positions on without having to look at it.  All of the buttons on this controller are in a grid and I always had to look at it in order to use it.  (sort of like not being able to find the F and J keys on your keyboard by touch, annoying)  I have a secondary vizio set that costs < half of this tv and it has a bluetooth remote that is easier to operate without looking at it and can serve as a universal remote for A/V receiver.Return experience has been less than stellar due to constant rescheduling of white glove delivery carrier.

But I have to say I'm pretty disappointed that I can be asked to spend over $2K for a 3d TV and not receive 3d glasses included in the price. (especially since the 55\" LED version which is basically the same price, comes with 3d glasses) Even more disappointing is that Samsung felt I should have up until June 25th where it offered a promo for two free pairs of 3d glasses on certain models, the PN59D8000 being one of them. Lastly some vendors were \"giving away\" a 3d starter pack and blu ray player with the purchase of certain qualified Samsung TV's. However, they are charging full retail price for the units averaging $300 more than those vendors not providing the promo. How exactly is that \"giving away\"?

I've always been a fan of plasma's and so had my mind set on a higher end Panasonic. (either GT30 or VT30.)  I was considering a 55\" Panasonic and then read some great reviews on the Samsung PN59D8000 and 7000.  I liked the look, went to the store to see both sets in person.  It was still tough to tell the differences in store due to the wacky settings they use.  Both looked really good to me and I knew either would be a major upgrade from a 6 year old DLP.  I ended up with the Samsung PN59D8000 on a Amazon lightning deal.  The price was $900 cheaper than the sale price at a Magnolia!  The 55\" GT30 Panasonic on Amazon was slightly more so, for the money the top end Samsung was too good of a deal especially for the larger 59\" screen. Delivery was painless.  I hear the PN59D7000 is almost the same and now can be had for a few hundred cheaper.  At the time I got the 8000 for the same price as the 7000 so it was an easy decision.When I first turned the TV the picture was just amazing, I knew I would be happy with this set. I noticed no screen peel or color pops as some other have seen on this set.I highly recommend going through and calibrating the set. When finished the picture is remarkably more even and lifelike.  Keep in mind that you may want to set the calibration in movie mode for each input.  I watch movies via both PS3 on Blu Ray and also via Netflix streaming on the xbox.  You may want to calibrate your HDTV feed as well.Overall this is a VERY excellent TV. Highly recommended.NOTES:  Silver color of the bezel in the pictures would be if you have a super bright white room.  Actual color is dark grey.  The Remote is surprisingly good.  I thought I would hate it..actually find the layout great and easy to use.Cons? Very few.  There is a minor buzz that you can hear in a dead quite room from 5ft away.  Sound covers this up immediately.Speaking of sound, it's bad.

The TV's I purchased are:1.  Sony Bravia XBR55HX929 LED LCD TV2.  Sony Bravia KDL46NX720 LED LCD TV3.  Samsung PN59D8000 Plasma TV4.  Samsung UN46D7000 LED LCD TVOut of all four, I would recommend the Sony KDL from a performance and price perspective.  The KDL was $1,200 as compared to the XBR at $2,699, and honestly most people won't be able to tell the difference between the two.  Save the money here.  But I love both of them.  I would recommend the Sony HTCT550W Sound Bar though, it makes a great step up in sound if you don't want to go the whole home theater route with speakers all over a room.I am less enthusiastic about the Samsungs.  The Samsung PN59D8000 went in my home theater room, and it does have a great picture and I love watching basketball games on it, but it does emit an audible buzzing noise, and it is really noticeable when you sit directly in front of the TV about ten feet out.  When the Home Theater guys got me set up, they said that was normal for a plasma to emit a low buzzing noise like that, and that it wasn't a defective tv.  I wasn't aware of that when I bought a plasma, so heads up.The worst tv on my list is the Samsung UN46D7000.  I wanted to like this tv, I really did, as it is a great looking tv with the clear bezel and sharp looking silver stand, but the performance is so far below the other tv's on this list it isn't funny.  Quite simply, it can't handle sports and fast motion without going blocky and an extreme amount of blurring.  And, the tv was $300 more than the Sony KDL46NX720.  Save $300 and go with the Sony, you'll be better off.  And yes, I spent one whole evening trying different calibrations from other user reviews to attempt to give my  tv different settings to help with the issue, but no luck.  I would not recommend this tv.Overall, since plasmas apparently emit a low buzzing noise, and the UN46D7000 has some severe performance issues, I would go with the Sonys.  And unless you are an Audiophile, save the $1,500 and go with the KDL.That's my observations after about two months ownership.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "From a Photographer with a critical eye. Impressive TV to say the least.", "Author": "Sean Foulkes", "ReviewID": "R1B1NJ7VTLNFGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would realistically give it 4.5 stars out of 5, because after months of shopping for the perfect TV for 2 grand or under, I settled on this for the home theater, and also for video games. I wanted plasma for it's black levels, and sacrificed a slight bit of screen brightness and weight for it. Definitely wouldn't take this TV back and get anything else, unless I wanted to move up to the 64\".***FIRST THE NEGATIVES******************************1) TV has grayed out settings that I can't seem to access, and being a tech guy I really want to adjust my TV to it's full potential. I have not contacted Samsung about this, but did a few casual Google searches to no avail.2) Plasmas have a low-level buzzing the most power they consume. So when the screen is completely white the TV will be the loudest. This is noticeable in a quiet room, unless the surround sound is turned up, in which case you forget about it pretty quickly if you have good sound, which I think is required for a beautiful 60\" display like this. Anyone who buys a Plasma this large and uses it with the built-in speakers is an idiot. This TV is designed for a medium-sized home theater and performs wonderfully. Buy a cheap LED-LCD if you want something big and shiny to watch the news in the living room with. I live in Bozeman, Montana, so the altitude makes this a bit louder than at sea level. So if you have very sensitive ears or this might bug you, and you live in the mountains, I would seriously consider LED.3) The TV does get warmer than you'd expect when used for long periods of time. I was not expecting this, but it doesn't seem to get anywhere near warm enough to be concerned about it getting damaged. Just something to look out for.4) BURN IN: I've run into this only once when I first bought it, falling asleep with the movie menu constantly repeating. The OPPO BluRay doesn't automatically put a screensaver on when you let the movie menu constantly loop. I'm sure either the TV or the BluRay has an option somewhere to combat this, but I did let it go for about 6 hours and had MASSIVE burn in. I was so scared i'd ruined my TV. I turned it off for a few hours and it went away magically. Then I used the burn-in screensaver built into the Samsung plasma to further lower my stress level. Nothing was permanent.***On another note, I've played Skyrim for over 120 hours on this thing, with the health bars and various stats on the screen staying in the same place for hours on end, and I have not noticed any burn in from video games. Roommates also play Modern Warfare 3 religiously on it, and no burn in from the HUD on that game either. So don't worry about burn-in as a gamer, as I believe I have used this TV to the extreme with video games and have had no side effects.***NOW THE POSITIVES********************************1) Picture is amazing. I haven't had it calibrated, as I am a photographer I can usually get things tweaked pretty close just by watching movies and adjusting it over the first few weeks. Black levels are pretty impressive. I now use this TV to final view photo projects, as it is a better judge of shadow areas than my Macbook is. Literally, stuff shows up on this TV that the laptop's already impressive LCD screen can't display in the black areas. It was pretty surprising when I first tried this.Let's get this straight (if you are picky and looking for incredible performance): In a completely dark room, adjusted, the black levels on this TV are almost as dark as the pure blackness of the physical bezel (which emits no light) just outside the picture area. Not quite pure black but really close. Closer than any other display i've ever seen. I'm sure its not the best in the world but I am really impressed.2) The 3D works just fine. Better than the theater, etc... yawn. I've used it a half-dozen times to show drunk friends how cool 3D is, and that's about it. Not necessarily worth buying an arsenal of 3D glasses for your friends, but cool nonetheless. Also, Drunk and playing Call of Duty: Black Ops is a bad idea. It looks wicked cool, but you will throw up, or want to eventually. I did.3) Remote is kinda cool with the keyboard and such, but I use an AppleTV and the Xbox (and sometimes the BluRay player) to use Netflix, etc. The home screen with all the apps is a little cluttered but seems fine if you don't have any other internet devices in your entertainment center.This TV is loving it's new home in my home theater setup with:Onkyo TX-NR709 ReceiverOPPO BDP-93 BluRayEmotiva UPA-1 Amp for L/R speakersLEFT/RIGHT - Bowers & Wilkins 685REAR L/R - Bowers & Wilkins 683CENTER - Bowers & Wilkins HTM61SUB - HSU Research VFT-3 Mk III...I've built a half-dozen home theater setups over the years, each getting subsequently better as i try out new gear, learn from my mistakes, etc etc. This setup I might keep for years, I am VERY impressed with it. I don't' even feel the need to continuously tweak it and it's been that way for five months. Overall just really happy with the TV.*Note* TV looks awesome in person, and its a bit heavy so don't put it on any thin glass shelving.*******SUMMARY****************************************If you are OCD about your tv being the best, or near best, quit stressing over TV shopping and just get this one, or the 64\" version, although surprisingly I haven't lost any sleep going with the second biggest TV i could find (usually I get buyers remorse for not getting the absolute best). We use the CRAP out of this thing daily, and the more BluRays I watch and the more XBOX that is played just makes me happier I got it and not another TV. Other than the nitpicks that even my roommates don't care about, this TV is the best of all the televisions i looked at from Sears to Vann's (we have one in Bozeman thank god) to the other local electronics stores. I spent months researching on the internet before I made the jump, and I wish I had just done it sooner. Overall incredible TV.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible and incredibly frustrating (fluctuating brightness / white point) get the UN60D8000 instead", "Author": "Stephen Gates \"Steve G\"", "ReviewID": "R1AITJO04Y3ER0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I decided to replace my old TV I did my homework by doing tons of research and read tons of reviews. After all of that I ended up buying the PN64D8000 based on all the tons of amazing reviews and testimonials. I have lived with this TV for a while now and I can honestly say that I have never been so disappoint with a \"top of the line\" product from any brand at any price point as I have been with this TV.There is no denying that this TV looks beautiful with it's thin edge and it's slim design makes it look more like an LED TV than a plasma. I ended up hanging mine on the wall because the four legged TV stand made me nervous as it was stable side to side but it seemed like it could tip over fairly easily front to back. Extras like the apps in the Samsung Smart Hub are a nice addition but if I am going to surf the web I would rather do it on my laptop and I found that services like Hulu Plus and Netflix had better picture quality when I ran them on my Playstation 3.At the end of the day I buy a new TV for only one reason - the picture quality and this is where this TV really excelled and really let me down. The characteristics that were called out in all the reviews I read were the overall image resolution and the black level which are both fantastic. However, where this TV really falls down is on it's brightness, overall image consistency and out of the box image settings.This overall image brightness on this TV is about 20% darker than any other TV I have ever owned so the picture ends up looking dull and doesn't pop off the screen the way I had hoped it would.  That overall brightness problem is also complicated by a brightness throttle built into the TV that keeps the picture at or below a fixed intensity. This throttle causes huge consistency problems as some scenes will look perfect and then and you see it kick in when the majority of screen has really light or white content and the TV keeps it from displaying a pure crisp white and instead it throttles it back so you get a muddy light grey. I own other plasma TV's so I know that plasma can have a problem with this but I have never seen any TV have the white point problem get this bad.Since installing it I have spent days researching, tweaking and adjusting every setting on the TV to get this problem to go away and there is simply no way to fix it and it drives me insane. I have also found out that I needed to do even more research to find professional calibration settings to get the color to look good as the out-of-the-box image setting are really awful. I went through 10 to 15 different calibrations before I was able to find one I liked and each one of those calibrations takes about 10 minutes as you have to enter somewhere around 50 different settings.If you want more proof that this is not a calibration problem and that this is a real problem with this TV then just look at the review on televisioninfo.com where they tested the peak brightness of the PNXXD8000 plasma vs. the UNXXD8000 LED.  The plasma scored a 90.43 cd/m2 while the LED scored a 357.93 cd/m2 which is nearly four times as bright. Read the whole thing for yourself [...]Samsung put the sexy and slim design of this TV ahead of the image quality and for a \"top of the line\" TV these problems are inexcusable.My final advice would be if you are thinking about buying this TV go see it in person and REALLY look at the picture quality. There are a lot of reviews like this one and articles that prove this is a real problem with this TV. MAKE the store change through a few different types of content and get a hold of that remote so you can pull up the Expert Patterns ( MENU > PICTURE > ADVANCED SETTINGS > EXPERY PATTERN) which will show you how the TV is going to render colors and what is going to happen with the brightness and white point. Obviously a lot of people are perfectly fine with this problem but do yourself a favor and make you know if you are one of those people before you buy this TV.UPDATE: RETURNING THIS TV - 12/11/2011It quickly became apparent that this white point and fluctuating brightness issue was something I wan't going to be able to live with long term. I emailed and called Samsung, went on a number of different AV boards and after a lot of discussion it became clear that the TV was working correctly and this was a built in problem I wasn't going to be able fix. So I have decided to return it.I am going to replace it with the Samsung 65\" D8000 LED even though it is $1000 more. I decided to throw all the reviews out the window and go and really test the picture in person to see which I liked better.  I tried going to my local Best Buy and a high end home theater store but both were more concerned with selling me an expensive TV than answering my questions. I ended finding my answers at the Samsung \"Experience\" flagship store in the Time Warner Center here in New York City where they had the 65\" plasma and 65\" LED side-by-side. The staff was incredibly gracious and after I explained my problems and gave me the remotes for both TV so I could put each through their paces on blu-ray movies, broadcast TV and pull up the Expert calibration screens to test them right next to each other.  The LED was night and day better with the white point and overall brightness. The difference was so apparent that my wife who who thought I was crazy for having this problem but has come to love the maddening eccentricities that come with marrying a designer finally saw the problem and said \"The LED looks incredible and the plasma looks grey and muddy. We are returning the plasma.\"UPDATE: PN64D8000 VS UN60D8000 - 12/23/2011Amazon we fantastic about returning the TV and exchanging it for the Samsung UN60D8000 without any problems, return fees or restocking fees. The difference between the two TV's is night and day and the Samsung LED has the best picture I have ever seen on any TV. I am so happy I bit the bullet and exchanges it because I just couldn't have lived with the limitations of their Plasma's.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "All around awesome television", "Author": "Bob R. \"Bob R.\"", "ReviewID": "R1E6MJ0V1O04AG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It would be easy to write a huge review nitpicking every aspect of this set and its pros and cons, but there are already many lengthy reviews here. Let me give you the more 'reader's digest' version. This is an amazing television! It looks sharp, is so thin it is surprising, has phenomenal image quality and the most bang for the buck you can find. Alright, you need a few more details? Here we go.I have used this set in bright light and in darkness and the picture quality is superb in all lighting. I am a huge fan of plasmas because of the image quality they produce and this set is the top of that bar for quality. The HD is so crisp it has at times captivated me so much that I was concentrating on the beauty of the image and kind of lost track of the story I was watching.The 3D capability s also top notch with very little distortion or artifact in the image (but some of the distortions in 3D are inherent in the video source, not in the playback device). The 2D to 3D converter is just okay, but I have never seen one that was better (I have seen many Blu-Ray players and TV's that have this capability and they are all merely alright). You can watch 3D content at pre-set levels, or you can customize the effect. I find the pre-set levels perfect. Watching a good 3D HD movie on this set is an awesome experience and it has at times taken my breath away!The wireless internet connection works nicely. I have had trouble playing some flash content, but most of the apps work well, including Netflix. I have not yet tried Skype, but I do not foresee any trouble as the rest of the smart TV functions are fine.The remote is complex. You will have a learning curve here. It is two sided, one side has all the usual buttons as well as some advanced functions, the other side has a QWERTY keypad and other functions to use mostly with your Smart TV and internet apps.Okay, if you need some \"cons\", here are a few; the set burns hot. This is not abnormal for plasmas, but if you get right up to the screen, or put you hand around the back, the heat it's giving off can be surprising. It has no effect on the image at all. Also, in addition to the remote, you will have a decent sized learning curve on the features and customization of this set, so be aware that this will take time. The good part is once you get the set out of the box and go through your initial set-p (which takes just minutes) you can use the set without needing to know all the fancy stuff and learn the finer points at your leisure while enjoying your television. And like every other advanced TV on the market, the audio quality is just decent. Face it, this is a television, not a high-fi surround sound audio system, but it has all the connections you need to hook into one.The set also has plenty of connectivity options for any device you may want to input from be it a DVR, DVD player, USB device, component system or other video/media source.Bottom line: This is one amazing television that will most likely exceed your expectations.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Have a Man Crush on my 64\" Samsung", "Author": "M.

I dont expect to have to return the set, but I have 30 days no questions if I feel the need.  One thing about the delivery is that I selected a different time than the default.  In speaking to the shippers, they told me that they dont get the schedule updates so it seems the delivery default is from 11-3pm.  No problem, but something good to know.  The delivery company (CEVA) was responsive, called before their arrival and setup/powered on the unit.  Very good experience.Now the TV.  Perhaps it is such a jump from my old 4:3 53\" RP Sony, but the picture is just beautiful.  The pictures are sharp, vibrant and really pop off of the screen.  I used the PIP feature of the TV, and it \"seems\" that I can only get network out of the PIP rather than from the dish (which makes sense because there is only one output from the receiver to the TV).  I found the Samsung E-Manual to be very annoying and cumbersome to use on the TV.  Clearly they are trying not to print paper, but the one time I actually READ the manual is when I first get the TV so the learning curve is longer because I have to page through the manual via the TV (but I believe that Samsung will allow you to download one).The TV stand does look like the Cylon Base Star, but it works.  It is heavy, made of metal and I do not notice it when watching TV.  The screed DOES WOBBLE when on the stand, but I am more than confident it wont simply fall over because of it.The TV remote takes a little getting used to, but it works well when typing in searches and surfing the net via the TV.  Its not a full blown browser, but it does display the sites I normally visit quite nicely.The biggest challenge I had was setting up Netflix.  When I would fire up the application via the SmartHub on the TV, it would say \"Not connected to the internet\" (when I CLEARLY was attached to the internet).  Called Samsung, they said if internet is working then it is Netflix problem.  Called Netflix and they said my bandwidth was too low to stream a movie (even though every other device streams JUST FINE).  Netflix said to call my cable operator.  In the end, I physically needed to UNPLUG the TV for 30 seconds and then replug it back in.  This is a hard reset and from that point, the Netflix application was able to register and stream movies without issue.Looking forward to seeing some sports on this TV.  I am very happy with the purchase.  I have not seen the fluctuating black issue and there isnt a peeling of the protective coating (but I will continue to watch both very closely.)I was considering the 70\" Sharp, the 65\" Panasonic VT30 and the 64\" Samsung PN64D8000.

I was lucky to watch this TV and Samsung UN51D8000 side by side and picture quality in this TV is so superior. New high end LEDs look nice and obviously very thin and light.

I also go to the Menuto change the Cell Light setting, if needed, but those are the only calibration adjustments I makeand not very often.

There's been a little screen heat, but nothing ofa serious nature at all.  The only complaint I have is that this TV is not compatible with Skype.Hopefully, Samsung will generate a firmware update and an application to resolve this issue.  As of this writing (6/1/11), the only Samsung/Skype application is for its 64-inch and no other Samsung plasma TV's.  No big deal, really.  I just utilize Skype on my desktop monitor instead.Netflix works great on the TV via my Samsung 6500 blueray for streaming and DVD playback.  I alsoenjoy the 3D features, which will only get better (Netfix does not offer 3D content yet).In conclusion, the 51-inch is by far the best TV I have ever owned and it will not disappoint --especially its vivid colors and high definition.

Unfortunately, the apparently intrinsic problem of floating brightness/contrast that this TV displays is simply unforgivable and impossible not to notice once it is noticed.  I am a filmmaker and editor so the image is of utmost importance to me, which is what led me to purchase this TV after extensive research.  Curiously, the problem of floating brightness was not a widely publicized one (and still isn't), not being evident in such exhaustive reviews like the one found on CNET (who recently updated their review on this TV to include the recognition of the floating brightness issue).I had the TV serviced (sad to have done in the first 2 months) with the mainboard being replaced to no avail.  The floating brightness still remains.  There are ways to ease this problem through picture settings, but in no way is it eliminated.  Several forums, such as the one on AV Science Forum [...] document this issue and the overall conclusion is that this problem is a TV-centric characteristic that cannot be fixed by any means and one that Samsung apparently has no interest in addressing.If I had it to do over again, sadly, I would not purchase this TV.  Since I am beyond my refund/return window I must make due.  This is so disappointing considering that when the floating brightness is not present (which is not often enough) the picture is outstanding.  Many viewers simply do not notice this problem.  It is not random, as has been proven by others and myself.  The floating brightness can be reproduced using specific video examples (certain combinations of light and dark images moving across the screen in certain shots).  I reproduced this for the Geek Squad service technicians who didn't seem to have any suggestions or opinions (my impression of Geek Squad is a whole other story!).Basically, it's a beautiful TV crippled by a terrible display flaw that seems to be how the TV operates regardless of service.

Sold my house and offered that TV to any buyer who came with a full price offer.  Stayed with Samsung because I was very happy with the old one and the CNET TV Reviews were very favorable on this new 64\".  They do extensive testing and provide a calibration sheet with the settings they used to get the best viewing experience.  Everyone's eyes/room arrangements are different but this provides a good starting point for fine tuning your settings.  Especially useful when you consider the array of test equipment they have access too.  I went to lots of review/test sites on the web to research this purchase and found the same recurring theme/belief in the industry that Panasonic and Samsung make the best TV's.  No more Pioneer Kuro to compete with them.  Consumer Reports online reviews also pushed me towards a plasma TV.  I had thought about going LCD because my old plasma used more electricity than my refrigerator.  Newer plasma's are way more efficient at the slight cost in picture brightness.  This new 64\" Samsung Plasma TV weighs less than 100 pounds.  Because of the thin bezel it looks smaller than my old TV which isn't a bad thing.  But it is the thin bezel that allows them to squeeze out one more inch of picture screen and that is the important part.  The picture is fabulous in HD and this TV does a way better job on Standard TV (Non-HD) then my old one.  Because the picture is so good on HD broadcasts we don't even bother watching anything that is not in High Def.  Both my wife and I feel the picture is better than our old set.

I loved the TV, but it had developed a burn in problem outside the 4:3 box.  The left and right margins of the screen were darker than the middle of the screen.  It was mild at first, but got progressively worse, to the point where it was noticeable and annoying.I called Pauls TV, where I had purchased it, and they told me it was slightly outside the one-year warranty period.  They gave me Samsung's number and I was told that they sometimes honor the warranty after expiration, depending on the problem and how far out of warranty the item is.I called Samsung fully expecting to pay for a service call.  Instead, they suggested the service call might still be free, even though the warranty had expired.  They asked me to send a copy of the receipt, which I did.  The next day, I got a call from Nisi, an authorized repair service, and they sent someone to my house free of charge soon after.The repairman showed me an option in the setup menu that can alleviate burn in problems.  It continuously sweeps a white bar across the screen.  He said to run it overnight and see if it helped.  After running it overnight two days in a row, the problem remained.I called Nisi back.  They indicated that they would need to order a new plasma panel, and that it would take as long as two weeks.  The next week they called to schedule a repair appt the following Monday.  The Friday before the appt. they called to cancel the appt.  Apparently, the panel was backordered and would take longer to deliver than they thought.  Because of the delay, they said Samsung would give me the option of a replacement TV!I called Samsung, and after some navigation through their call center system, I got the \"executive\" support group on the line.  They confirmed that they would issue a replacement through Paul's TV.  They give Paul's TV a credit equivalent to what I paid originally, and Paul's TV then provides as close a replacement as the credit allows.  In my case, it covered an upgrade to the PN59D8000.It took some back and forth to actually make this happen, but on Monday Paul's TV arrived at my house and swapped my PN58C8000 for a new PN59D8000, straight from the box!  This far exceeded my expectations and Samsung went over and above in my opinion.Suffice to say, Samsung has earned my loyalty. It will be my first choice of brand for a long time.*****************************All that said, the PN59D8000 is a terrific HDTV.  I love the PN58C7000, and the newer model is even better.Of course, the larger screen is a big bonus, but the best part is the improvement in the 3D technology.  With the older model, I rarely used the 3D because it had too much of a tendency to cut in and out.  It became more of a distraction than an enhancement.  With the newer model, I've found the 3D to work flawlessly so far. Now I need to go get another pair of glasses so our four person family can all watch at the same time.Another nice feature is the addition of a built in browser and the enhancement of the net applications.  Having a remote with a QWERTY keyboard make this an even more usable feature.The picture is just as nice as the older model, and maybe a bit better.  When I switch to the \"Dynamic\" picture mode, I can watch it in broad daylight with no problem. And it happens to be in a pretty sunny room.  The blacks are inky and the colors are vibrant.  Watching football games on this beast is a blast.  The picture is big and there is no hint of delays or artifacts. The players jump off the screen.I have no problems with buzzing.  This unit does run a little warmer than the last one, but the room tends to be chillier than other part of the house, so I don't mind.I can't comment on the sound, as we run that through an Onkyo TX-NR709 (excellent!) and surround speakers.When I purchased the original TV, I compared the Panny and Samsung models side by side, with a variety of source material. I found them to be pretty close, but I actually preferred the Samsung.*****************************A note about screen burn-in: If you read carefully, the manual warns against watching 4:3 content in a 16:9 picture size for long periods of time as that will lead to potential screen burn in.  I don't think that was the problem with my original unit, as I had hints of the problem right from the first day I plugged it in (I didn't find the problem sufficiently pronounced to return the TV at the time).  However, the default picture size is 16:9 and I began to notice that my kids don't bother tuning to the HD channels, resulting in letterboxing.  I imagine this exacerbated the problem.  I've since taught them to either watch HD or switch the picture size from \"4:3\" (which I believe was called \"Wide Screen\" on the PN58C8000).Knowing what I know now, I'd recommend anyone with kids (or a non-technically inclined spouse) to watch out for the same problem.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great set!

Outstanding customer service.The HDTV has capabilities I haven't begun to explore in depth yet (and I use a surround-sound system and thus won't comment on the TV's inherent sound quality).  But all of those extra capabilities exist in so many ancillary products these days that they weren't primary goals in choosing the Samsung.  I wanted the best 2D and 3D picture I could buy for a reasonable, albeit substantial, price (a price that Best Buy and other local retailers couldn't come remotely close to, by the way).  The Samsung has given me exactly that.

Sadly learned that Mitsubishi no longer made a 65\" TV and that most LED's only went to a 60\" - just can never go 'down' in size.  Samsung makes a 65\" LED, but the price was way more than we wanted to spend.  Many nights and hours were spent on the internet reading reviews and doing research, which lead to the decision between the Panasonic or Samsung plasma.  Never but never considered a plasma before, but after every salesperson we encountered and reviews galore suggesting going to plasma, we decided to take a look.  Loved the new gray frame on the Samsung 8000 and it just had a flawless picture.  We just did not care for the glaring black glass frame around the Panasonic.  So, placed our order with Amazon and it arrived via Fed Ex four days later.  Box was in perfect condition, set-up was simple and now we sit here truly amazed at the extremely outstanding viewing this Samsung offers.  Bought a simple low profile wall-mount, two pairs of 3D glasses, and an extended warranty (Square Trade Warranty) also from Amazon and HDMI cables from Costco.  We started out with no interest in having 3D on a new TV, but now that we have viewed some 3D shows via DirectTV - so happy we got the 3D - my husband especially loves it for ESPN sports.  Know many of the new thin TV's have a huge issue with sound, but so far, we are VERY satisfied with the sound on this TV.  Have a full 'surround sound' system, so for movies will just use that - but for 'everyday' viewing, the sound on this Samsung is just fine - best sound on \"Movie\" setting.  Used the Samsung remote to do set-up and get it fine tuned, but find the DirectTV much easier for our use.  Just do not see how anyone can go wrong with this TV - it's AWESOME and looks like a million bucks hanging on our wall in the Great Room !!!

I couldn't be happier! The picture quality is stunning and lives up to Samsung's reputation with the blackest \"blacks\" and a rich full color with nothing really overly saturated. Have watched a few pre-season NFL games in high def and I am one happy sports fan. None of the fast-motion blurring of quality problems with the lower herz LCDs. Pristine NFL experience! The sound quality is \"average\", but I run everything through my home theater system anyways. I highly recommend using the fiber optic sound cable to your system though.Considering picture quality, I did tweak some of the settings for my personal taste. Overall, setup was easy and fairly simple. It recognized my wireless router quickly. The setup for that was simple and once I entered the security info, that was it. It did take about 20 minutes to download the latest updates for the TV itself.It's easy to access all of the various inputs on the back. The swivel stand it came with works pretty well for this.I also love the dual remote control that has a full QWERTY interface on the back. Very convenient! Everything lights up when you use it so you can see everything in a dimly lit environment. The remote really worked well with my fat fingers...easy to use and pretty intuitive.The one thing that impressed me was the anti-glare. I'll put this TV up against ANY LED/LCD out there in this regard. I still prefer to black out the windows for prime movie enjoyment, but at other times, I've never noticed glare from any lights, in particular the lamp beside my recliner.Overall, I really cannot find anything I'd complain about on the TV. Some people have mentioned the SmartTV menu navigation on Samsung, but I didn't find it all difficult or cumbersome to use. I'm using several different apps including Pandora.For the price however, it would be nice if Samsung included at least two pair of 3D glasses with purchase since it is a 3D TV. A bit silly to have to buy those separately. The 3D picture quality though is pretty good with the two movies I've watched on it. The glasses though themselves are abit of a pain as they reflect some ambient light on the inside....annoying. These are the cheaper Samsung glasses. I am researching to see if the higher-end glasses eliminate this. In the meantime, I'm trying to engineer a solution with the current pair I have.Overall, I am highly pleased with my purchase and highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best TV with some cons inherent to PLASMA technology", "Author": "Pinera", "ReviewID": "RDW0G8S2TZPAB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this TV from Amazon. Read a lot of reviews and was convinced that this was the best buy for the money I wanted to spend. I was looking for both LED and Plasma and settled for Plasma as several reviews reported the limited viewing cone for LED's. This TV does not disappoint in that regards. Some of the cons of this TV are the  sound quality is not that great - so you will need some kind of home theater system to truly enjoy. But this is true for any new LED or Plasma TV. The one biggest con is the screen burn-in for plasma. We primarily use the Netflix app to watch and many of our favorite shows or movies on Netflix do not cover the full-screen and so you see these black bands. This is the biggest drawback as you are then limited to watch HD only shows on Netflix. Had I know about this before, I would have settled for the LED model.

It arrived with a cracked screen(10\"+ star in top corner) with no damage on the box. Not sure what explanation for this may be. After refusing the delivery, I called up the local store (Magnolia) and ordered one from there. My mistake was that we never actually saw one in person.As soon as we plugged it in, both my wife and I noticed subtle but noticeable brown tint. I guess best described as looking through sunglasses. No matter what we tried, we could not get white to look like... well white. After applying calibration numbers found online, we got decent whites, but nevertheless the image was muted even at the highest cell light. I understand people prefer that and I agree that it did look nice watching a movie at 12am. However the image simply lacks colour pop. We put Ice Age on it side-by-size with a SHARP 60\" LED and the $1.5K SHARP showed much better, wowing colours. Again, I'm not talking about accurate colours, but vivid and popping colours.We then went to both BestBuy and Magnolia show room, and surprise-surprise - the damn TV looks muted there too (and whites a bit on the orange/brown side). Keep in mind those show rooms are quite dim - I'd say dimmer than the regular light we keep on in the house. We checked other plasmas there (e.g. panasonic vt30 and the pn64d8000, and pn59d7000), all looked the same dull colorOther issue I found distracting was line bleed. That's the problem where a line of text on a single-colour background shows horizontal streaks beyond the text. Quite visible...Anyway, i'm ordering the UN60D8000 to give it a try (again from Paul's TV hoping this one will come crack-less)", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality!", "Author": "Joseph M. Lawson", "ReviewID": "RVP5F6G858L96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a PN59D8000, which I have had for about two years now. I used the the picture settings provided by cnet, and all I can say is wow! It has one of the best pictures I've seen. The colors are very accurately reproduced. The blacks are very dark. The 3D is amazing. I've read some people having issues with burn-in in the reviews on here. I would have to say a lot of that is probably the user's fault. I've played video games for long times on mine (everything from shooters to racing games, with static HUDs), I've watched standard definition video with black bars on the sides, BluRay movies in letterbox with black bars on the top and bottom...I've never experienced any image retention. From day one, straight out of the box, I've always had the built-in pixel shift feature turned on. You will never notice the picture moving, as it only moves it one pixel at a time every couple of minutes. I always keep the picture setting on the same with any source, meaning I don't switch to gaming mode to play games or sports to watch a game. I leave it on Movie with the custom settings from cnet. As with any plasma, it will not be as bright as LCDs, but in my opinion this is a good thing as it doesn't lead to \"washed-out\" colors. Also, like any plasma, you will need to control the lighting in your room. Watching at night with the lights on is fine, but having the curtains open during the day leads to some pretty bad glare on the screen. This is not a knock on the set, as it's to be expected with a plasma. However, I found the brightness of the set to be adequate for daytime viewing as long as you can control the glare and reflections. I think those efforts are very much worth it to achieve the better overall image quality, the outstanding refresh rate, and great off-angle viewing this set provides over an LCD panel.The only issue I had with the set was the buzzing noise that you can research and find to be somewhat common. It wasn't a huge issue, as you could only hear it when there was no other audio going. I noticed it was worse if there was an image on the screen, as opposed to a black panel, and having purchased a SquareTrade warranty when I bought the TV, I decided to go ahead and get it checked in case it was something wrong with the panel itself. After replacing all the boards, the problem persisted. Samsung had the technician use a multimeter to get some readings from the boards. When he attempted this, there was an arc. Samsung had the technician keep trying, and it arced several times, ultimately shorting one or more boards out. SquareTrade is reimbursing me the purchase cost of the TV, which I will be using to buy an identical model. I would recommend this TV still, as like I said, the buzzing was only heard without any other audio. I would also highly recommend a SquareTrade warranty to anyone purchasing an expensive TV, Samsung or any other brand.

Expansive video range from virtually black (better dark gradations than most LCD's in videophile reviews) to bright white, ultra fine detail on faces - almost too revealing at times when you can discern even distant stunt doubles easily.  Hooked to a PC the display is 1920x1024 native resolution and 10 pitch text is very legible.  Gaming is nice as well.  We compared many other sets and technologies in person and cross-compared before buying via Amazon, specifically a Samsung PN59D8000 59-Inch 1080p 600Hz 3D Plasma HDTV  Liked it better than all but the highest end Sony's which were hundreds more in price.  1080P high definition display quality is gorgeous, photorealistic, less harsh appearing but not quite as bright as LED monitors.  I enjoy the size and quality of the picture better than most of the images projected in theaters.  That may say it all.Special Features: Has 3D capability (glasses are extra cost).  Links with Samsung Android players and phones so you can directly see what is playing on your phone/player on the TV screen using a downloaded app from Samsung.  Neat but I have not used it that much.Cons: Needed to use with Roku because the built-in Internet appliance was dog slow.  As in arthritic dog.  But a Roku is a reasonable cost convenience and expands streaming service to Amazon Prime - so worth it.  Built in did not support Amazon streaming.  Would not want to surf using the built in CPU and the supplied keyboard controller.  Sound is OK but most who buy such a screen will opt for external speakers to enhance viewing and listening experience with some degree of surround sound.Caveat: too many buyers find a high pitch whine emanating from the Power Supply board.  Repair tech was quite useless and did not want to replace the board.  Some cannot hear such a high pitch while others have to tune it out.  They should find a design/fabrication solution for this as quite a few have reported it in Plasma sets from different manufacturers.But bottom line: Very happy with purchase with a year of experiencing the superb picture quality and the high pitch whine is soft enough for me not to notice now.1 year update:  Picture remains superb.I added a Roku 2 XS for the much better menuing it offers than using the built in Internet browser and a smoother streaming experience. Find Amazon Prime films and shows using internet and save on watch list.  Navigation and streaming is then a breeze on the Roku.

Unfortunately, the entire tv is ruined by an annoying and persistent buzzing, that is focused on the area directly from the center.  If you lie down to one side or watch from an angle, you wont hear it. But since most viewing is from direct center, moreso because this is a 3d tv, you will be constantly annoyed by the buzzing.  How loud is it?  In quiet scenes its overwhelming.  In normal viewing, you can still hear it in the background.  Only if you turn up the volume will you not hear it.  I thought maybe it was a factory defect, but based on other reviews, this problem is pretty common.  So, I guess you gotta ask yourself, if a great image is worth putting up with the annoying buzzing.

I was skeptical that a TV of this size could maintain such quality at first. I was wrong. Now let's get to my review. If you're reading this and thinking of getting this on Amazon.. BEWARE of vendors using Manna Distribution for delivery services. Dealing with them was a nightmare and a half.Now, I could sit here and talk about the inky pitch dark blacks or amazing shadow detail or color realism, but it's all been done already. So I'll To the nitty gritty. Nothing major.. but worth looking into if you're a picky videophile like me. Personally anything that cost more than a grand is definitely worth being picky over IMO.I haven't even began tweaking the settings yet.. I have my contrast set to 50 and brightness 45 on 'relax'. And boy this thing still displays everything like a champ in brightly light rooms. Now, I did almost instantly notice the 3 big things people have been picking on about this TV and those things were the occasional glare on the screen, the buzzing and the brightness pops amongst other things. All 3 very mild.. but there (depending on your set).1.) The buzzing: you'll only probably notice if your set is in a quiet environment or you're not using surround speakers. I've read it's common in a lot of new plasmas, since they consume so much energy in the beginning of their lifespan but gradually goes goes away. I'll be sure to come back here and make note of it if this happens.2.) The glare: is virtually unavoidable. If a bit of light seeps into your living room, it will find it's way onto your screen. But by no means ruins your viewing experience.3.) And last but not least for me, and by far the most notable.. the brightness pop: This might be a set specific issue or not. I don't know.. but I do know since updating the firmware via the menu it's been minimized. I called Samsung and they walked me through a pretty basic procedure to say the least. I will be calling them back because now that I noticed it.. I will continue to until it goes away.With that said, I am going back to enjoying this BEAST of a TV. Will make this a 5-star review instead of 4 if I get the brightness issue resolved. Now stop reading this and GO ORDER THIS NOW if you're thinking of it.UPDATE --So I've had someone come out to look at this regarding the brightness fluctuation issue twice after the USB sticks didn't seem to resolve the autodim issue. The 2nd time a new logic board was installed. The problem was mildly minimized, but is still there. I've learn to live with it just so I won't have to deal with the hassles of a return and because the picture quality really is superb in the end.

The problem with HDTVs is that there is no \"perfect\" model or brand and so there are tradeoffs. I would argue that the Samsung PN59D8000 has minimal tradeoffs. While everyone has different tastes I have found the image on the unit to be wonderful. Sure some videophile somewhere will argue about black levels, contrast ratios, or some other such nonsense but to me, my wife, my family, my friends, etc the picture looks amazing. Very few of us will sit with 2 HDTVs side by side and say \"gee the color pallette on this one is favoring the red end of the spectrum\" for the simple reason that most of us will have just 1 HDTV to look at in our living rooms. So if you can buy only one 3D HDTV this year I'd highly recommend taking a good long look at the Samsung PN59D8000.

Coupled with the \"slow\" refresh rates of LCD/LED TVs, the motion flow is just choppy and gives me an unnatural feel when watching programs on it.The plasma TV is rich with color and the brightness is just right.  In the store showrooms, the technicians there like to make the plasmas look like crap; in fact, they intentionally set the picture settings to make the picture look bad.  That's because they WANT to sell LED TVs.  I played around with this TV at the store for an hour, and after my tinkering, got the picture looking so beautiful and natural, there was no contest as to which TV to buy.I also love the fact that Samsung makes their plasma TV at 51\" (uncommon size)!

No grey/black as i see with my LED AND LCD... like I said I also own a LED and LCD and the Plasma (this one) is 100,000,000 X better in ALL areas... (colour, refresh rate, BLACKS. style)i am not going to give a long revue as i am sure you have seen 100 or so and your eyes hurt from your computer screen. In closing I will say, any TV you get will look great in your living room. But once you see this TV next to 70 others on the best buy wall... you will know you have the Alpha dog of TV's. you will see what your money is going to and then and only then will you see your getting the best. well the best under $10,000. and FYI I looked at the Panasonic $10,000 TV and yes the pitcher is GREAT!!! but the TV itself looks like crap... see for yourself.I hope this helps.

It was stolen. Well, I moved and was immediately in the market for another, but didn't like the ghosting issues with the PN63 and of most of the other 3d TV offerings of 2010. I decided to wait a few months for the 2011s. When I first heard of the new samsung D8000 LED I really loved the design, but checked it out in stores, read some reviews, and had some second thoughts. I really wanted to love the d8000 LED because I didn't want to worry about any burn-in issues that plasmas can potentially suffer. I never had any such issues with the PN63, but I did go through a pretty lengthy 200 hour break-in period. I decided that burn-in was pretty much a non-issue and so jumped aboard the plasma bandwagon again. I had not seen any demos of the new TVs 3d quality, so I was bit leery of buying a new one with the same issues. I figured I would just return it if that was the case. I've not yet tried all the 3D material I have on hand (movies, games), but what I have checked out has been impressive. Where is the crosstalk/ghosting that was so obvious to me on the PN63? From what I can tell so far, its pretty much gone, and what teensy-weensy bit I do see is hardly noticeable. Its really amazing how much better the 3D quality is on this TV. Maybe its the new bluetooth glasses having better sync with the TV. I'm not sure. I still have some movies and a game or two to check out in 3D, and I hate to upset owners of the previous generation, but so far it beats the previous gen by a long shot, imho. Standard 2D 1080p looks simply amazing on its own, so you wouldn't have to be a 3D fan to love this TV, but if you are I don't think there's any better 3D TV on the market right now.Update 5/12/2011: Played the new Motorstorm Apocalypse and saw ghosting that was as bad as on my previous TV. I mean bigtime obvious. This seems strange to me as I don't seem to notice ghosting on Wipeout HD. Contrast is a big factor so maybe Motorstorm just has more of this. Will have to take another look at Wipeout. So far other material does look better though, as far as ghosting, than the previous TV.Additional things that kinda bug me about having a plasma: Some video sources will not allow you to change the side bars from black to grey to prevent burn-in, e.g. Netflix, HD stations broadcasting 4:3 content, Blu-ray player video (PS3, insert your blu-ray player here). I love old movies and programming, and hate grey side bars. I'm in a dillema now about whether to get an LED. Will continue to update this review...TV was returned.

I still have not figured out how to use the QWERTY keyboard. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough in the manual(have not spent a ton of time on this) but I'm not dumb and clearly this is not obvious.2. Some of the 3D apps don't work with my internet well. I have a dual band Linksys and use an ethernet connection with high speed internet service, but it still freezes and buffers continuously. There is actually a warning that you need a high speed to avoid this, but can't imagine I'm that different than many users.3. The browser works but is so cumbersome I really don't bother with it and feel the smart features are simply not worth the added cost associated with the TV.I would say the buzzing written about is so faint it is a zero issue and one I almost never hear...complete non issue.

This is our 3rd Samsung after moving our 2006 Samsung into the guest bedroom and bringing in our PN50B530 into the bedroom. We were a bit hesitant since we originally bought the 59D8000 and had problems with it from the start. The first one wouldnt power up and the replacement had a black bar in the middle of the screen. We decided to go big or go home and upgraded to the 64D8000 and let the chips fall where they may.This TV is absolutely amazing. It's a great size for just about any livingroom. We bought ours from BB so we got a great deal as they're purging their stock and making room for the 2012 models. Ours came with a free 3-D Blu-ray player (BD-5500) and 4 sets of 3D glasses (SSG-3050GB) for $2399.As far as the TV goes, the picture is rich and full of color. There are plenty (if not too many) options for tweaking/calibrating the colors and settings. I'd recommend searching online on CNET or AVS Forum. Try a few different ones to get you going and then tweak to your liking as needed. I tried some that had great reviews only to find my picture fairly green. Then I found one that was perfect.I will say that I dont think the online capability or widgets have been something we've used tons if at all. Most people watch TV with a tablet near them using the SmartHub is counterintuitive to us and more cumbersome than anything. Sure it looks cool and impressive, but we havent found it useful as of yet. I do like the wifi capability for upgrading software without a USB.Another feature that looks cool until you really need to use it is the remote. It's chunky and feel awkward in our hands. It's nice that the backside is a full functioning QWERTY remote but not all apps/interfaces work recognize it. Again, it looks cool and you'll be glad to know that owners of 2012 models will have to buy one if they want one.The biggest take-away, is that this TV is a great size, produces excellent colors, has plenty of settings for configurating/calibrating.

The picture quality and color accuracy are both excellent. I watch a lot of sports in HD and so far, this TV has not let me down. Watching blu-ray DVDs is superb and gaming on it is pretty good too. The apps are pretty cool - like the ESPN app which works as a sports ticker so you can track all your teams/sports and scores while watching anything. There are also other cool apps like Hulu and Vudu so you can stream movies and TV shows.The black levels aren't as deep or inky as some of the other plasma TVs that compete with this one but very subtle to really notice a difference. There were some issues with fluctuating brightness levels or brightness pops but Samsung did address this issue. You can contact them directly and they will send you the most recent firmware on a USB to fix this problem. I also found out that you can turn off the ECO sensor to help with this issue as well.The rear panel is a bit flimsy and the 4 prong stand is kind of ugly but it does swivel. I mounted mine on a tilting mount and it's flush against the wall and looks very clean with the silver/glass trim. After about 150 hours, I went online to find some calibration settings and used the settings that CNET posted ([...]). The new settings made a nice difference and the colors are even more vivid and accurate.I would say that the Samsung PN59D800 is the best bang for your buck.

This replaced an older 50\" plasma from Samsung that I had for years.  This TV is very good quality in construction, design and even shape.  Its super thin, mounts on a wall easily and looks great.The remote control is amazing with a full QWERTY keyboard and back-light.My family loves having 3D capability so we also got 6 pairs of Samsung 3D glasses to go with the system.  The picture is bright and amazing quality, so much detail.  Screen burn seems to be think of the past.  I had an older model Samsung plasma and it had terrible screen burn issues, but not so much with this model.  My kids play video games with static content and this TV shows no signs of burn from them playing the games.  The old TV would leave screen burn after only a few minutes of play.I love the fact that this TV can play HD audio and video over USB.  If you don't have other home media streaming abilities, you can simply connect a USB drive to this TV and play your media directly off the USB drive.  It even has a decent media GUI interface on the TV.The only glitch I've noticed is that some of the smart apps take a while to load and sometimes won't start.  Powering off the TV and then back on seems to fix it.  Not a huge deal but still annoying.Bottom line, 3D works well, remote is great, picture quality is top notch, input flexibility is great - this is an amazing plasma TV.  I compared it to dozens of other units and even though about going with LCD/LED, but the picture quality and motion blur of those other technologies turned me off to the idea.  Plasma is superb, no motion blur, same great features and no brightness issues.  This is a great deal, highly recommend this TV.

This picture blows away the older TV. Blu-Ray DVD and streaming HD movies as well as football and HD network TV is simply beautiful to watch. I can even enjoy a \"Real Housewives\" or \"Dancing with the Stars\" episode on this TV - it does wonders for your marriage.Mounting: I mounted the TV on a stone wall using Samsung's own \"Ultra Slim Wall Mount WMN2000B\" which uses a steel wire screwed into the back of the TV allowing you to hang the TV like a picture. No large metal bracket attached to the wall. For a detailed description of how we managed the mounting project, search \"Tumblr echomine TV\" for a detailed blog post.Hurdles: Yes, we had a problem with the first unit we ordered. About 10 days after we started using it, a capacitor or other electrical component failed and the TV would no longer turn on. Googling the problem quickly revealed that it is a known issue. But it took about 5 minutes with Amazon customer service to arrange for pick-up of the defective unit and order/delivery of a new unit. The replacement product was on our wall less than a week later and is operating perfectly, and I have faith that if we have a problem, Amazon will step up again to solve it.  I was ready to call Samsung for service but it was unnecessary.I would say from this experience: (1) there's no benefit to paying hundreds more for the same product at a local store - Amazon and Paul's TV were very reliable; (2) don't be afraid of buying a new TV because of the negative reviews and known manufacturing defects - they are a fact of life but a good retailer will get you a working product, and when they work, the TVs are beautiful; (3) use experienced help (electricians, masons if you're drilling through stone) to mount your TV correctly, but don't rely on anyone but yourself to do the homework, make the choices on placement, materials, etc., and oversee execution.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very impressed!", "Author": "Phil DeDog \"Puppy Master\"", "ReviewID": "R1RAG95Z45AXGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice TV.

So, this is my first impression of this TV.It is very easy to install and set it up. It worked with my HD DVR DirecTV box right away. Then, I have to program my DirecTV remote to control this TV using DirecTV on screen setup menu. So, I can set aside my Samsung remote unless I need to use the smart TV features (Netflix, Youtube, ...).Setting up wireless network is simple, but it is annoying because it keeps asking for my DSL password every time go into Smart TV mode. I went through the network setup a few times, didn't help. This TV does not save my wireless password. I need to get help for this problem. Normally, I can get away without looking up in the use manual for most of the electronic toys around the house because the user interface of most of the electronic equipment are very good now.This Plasma 3D TV has great picture: high contrast and bright. The 3D picture is great when I watched football on ESPN3D (DirecTV).The 3D demo in Smart TV demands higher bandwidth than my 3 mbps DSL (the fastest DSL speed available for my house).  So, the video paused every minute waiting for loading. I also tried watching standard resolution Netflix movie and Youtube as well, same problem. Although, My Sony blueray player can stream Netflix movie fine with my slow DSL. This Samsung smart TV is slow in streaming! I hope that it is not because of the slow hardware.The Query remote is what we need, but the full keyboard does not always work. I had to flip the remote back to the normal TV remote keyboard to enter the text patiently. The Smart TV software does not use the query keyboard fully yet.I paid more money to buy this high end TV with full web browser. I am regret it now. The web browser is very slow and the Query keyboard is not always work in different screen. It is a lot cheaper and easier to connect a PC or a laptop or a media player to the cheaper HDTV than paying for this high price slow Smart TV.This Samsung PN59D8000 Smart TV works fine as a 3D TV, but it is not very smart yet.

Because of my profession I have an overly acute eye when it comes to image quality and tend to be very, very picky about my monitors (both video and computer)That said, I could not be more pleased with this TV.  I almost bought a large format LCD TV but I'm so glad I decided to go with the Samsung plasma.  The image is just breathtakingly incredible.  The black is so deep and the colors are so saturated (and yet so well balanced) that it's still hard to believe even three months after making the purchase.That should tell you something right there - it's been over 90 days and I still think \"wow!\" when I see the utterly sharp image on the wall.Everything else is really somewhat unimportant.  The 3D is very convincing and very clear.  The unit is surprisingly light considering its massive size and was very easy to hang on the wall.  The only quibble - a minor one - is that it does use quite a bit of electricity, despite what they claim on the energy star tag.  When adjusted for optimum image quality the TV draws 400 watts of power and add another 75 watts if you're watching in 3D.  (Measured with a calibrated meter)  The web based apps are kinda cute and actually more useful than I would have expected, though they could use more work (Really?  The YouTube app can't use the text keyboard when doing a search?  Really?)Overall the flaws are minor and completely unimportant when it comes to the main task: reproducing high definition video.  When it comes to image quality the Samsung Plasma is just outstanding.  I honestly don't think it would be possible to improve on the picture.Needless to say I am very, very (very) happy with this purchase.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung 51\" Plasma TV", "Author": "Mr. Frog", "ReviewID": "R323K847AWDIAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great picture out of the box . . . after following start up proceduresnew set is right next to CRT TV . . . new one exceptionally betterthe plasma displays sports action better than my relatives' LCDstill pictures displayed using a memory stick are clear even when viewed 2 feet or less from the screenhave also found there are some things i do not want to see in high definitioninternet not nearly as easy to work as on a computer . . . need to find a way to use a full sized keyboard and mouse in place of the TV remotethe high speed internet available in our area is not fast enough for streaming movies or broadcast TV therefore, have not activated the Netflix or Hulu linksno 3D glasses included with the set and the promo for free glasses has expired . . . therefore no comment on 3D performanceupdate after one month of use: bought this tv on sale . . . did not really want or need internet access or 3D, but i paid for them and these features should work. . . only . . . the QWERTY remote and 3D glasses rely on a bluetooth connection which has stopped working!  samsung support has not been any help.  i have performed all of their suggestions; new batteries, re-setting the tv, re-setting the remote, trying different positions and distances from the tv . . . and, my bluetooth enabled phone does not detect a connection from either the tv or remote.  the only option samsung gave was to return the tv and remote and go without a tv for how long??? at least through the World Series!  return is not a real option.update after 4 months of use: blue tooth receiver in the set itself has been replaced twice.  all other features continue to provide good service . . . no burn in of the screen noticed . . . picture still perfect", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture Quality and Value", "Author": "M. Rozenfeld", "ReviewID": "R2R51QIQMJMJNN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was time for to upgrade my 5-year old Samsung LNT4665F for something networked and with 3D functionality. I did quite a bit of research both online and with my own eyes at Big Box retailers and quickly concluded that plasma is a way to go for picture quality, 3D, and price. In fact, I thought that edge-lit LEDs went south in picture quality compared to their single light source ancestors. While the full-array LEDs produce respectable picture, the prices become a challenge.Once settled on a plasma, it came down to Panasonic and Samsung. LG, and others just didn't measure up either in person or on paper. Panasonics looked great and were highly recommended by Big Box sales staff.I was seriously considering getting the 55GT30. Here is what stopped me:1) Reports and personal accounts of poor customer support in the U.S.2) Prices for Active Shutter 3D glasses ($120/pair)3) Design4) Personal tendency to stick with what you know (aka Samsung)So I was scouting a decent price on a 51\" D8000 or a 59\" D7000, since most reviewers report nearly identical picture quality.At the end I got my PN51D8000 for $1,120 sold directly by Amazon, which I highly recommend (vs. dealing with Paul's, Electronic Expo, etc.). Amazon has a 30-day price guarantee, painless returns, and reliable customer service. TV did not come with any 3D glasses, but I was able to get the SSG3100s for $27/pair during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. So overall, cost to own was very reasonable.Now, let's talk about the TV. First of all I would like to say that the TV did not have ANY of the issues associated with this line. No pealing, no buzzing, nothing. The 51\" works as it should. It seems that most if not all of the problems appear on the 59\" and especially the 64\" versions of the set.2D Picture Quality: Outstanding colors and accuracy with both DirecTV, Blu-Ray, PS3, Xbox360. Excellent refresh rate as well as minimal lag time. The brightness is very adequate for a sun-filled room and it's not burning your retina at night like a lot of LED's would. The blacks are excellent, and what I mean here is shadow detail and all the shades of black and grey. I searched AVForum for calibration settings and settled on the ones posted by \"zoyd\" (see below)3D Picture Quality: Don't have much to compare this to, but can provide an honest review. Fist of all the resolution and color accuracy stays at 100% of the outstanding 2D PQ. The depth of the image is mostly inwards and a viewer gets a perspective \"into\" the tv versus things popping out of the TV. In terms of cross-talk aka seeing the second frame / ghost of the same image repeated, it is minimal and mostly appears when you have white objects on dark backgrounds. This is not a major downside and the 3D is very impressive. It puts a smile on your face every time you watch ESPN 3D or Animated 3D Blu-Rays.Smart Hub Features: They are cool but you won't be using them too often. A little cluttered, some apps take time to load. Vudu is great and the picture quality is surprisingly good. Didn't try Netflix. Youtube works well, so does Pandora. Other apps are more of a 2-3 time fun exercise, but I am not coming back to them unless someone is coming over and wants to take a look.Remote: I like the QWERTY remote. The keyboard only works with a select number of apps in the SmartHub and it works well. It also has a mini touch-pad behind the navigation button that allows you to have a pointer/mouse type functionality.Sound: I think it's ok. I mean this is a very thin TV, so as you can imagine, there are not a lot of places that the sound can come from. I am using external home theater system, so it's not an issue.Design: I like the slim frame/bezel and the color of the TV frame. It's much darker than it appears in the pictures. I am not sure if it's the same color as the D7000, if not, it could be a shade lighter. To me it looks classy and expensive, vs a typical piano-shiny-black finish of most TVs. The TV stand is ugly. I am being subjective, of course. I don't like it and I am not using it. The TV looks great when mounted on a wall.Calibration Settings:  TiVoHD zoyd cue03 LarryInRI zoyd zoyd zoyd CNET 500 CNET 1500  64D8000 51D8000 64D8000 64D7000  51D8000 51D8000 51D8000 59D8000  59D8000Mode  Movie Movie Movie Movie  Movie DAY NIGHT Movie  MovieCell Light 20 15 20 15  20 20 20 14  16Contrast 96 80 95 80  70 76 70 95  95Brightness 54 54 53 66  54 52 54 58  56Sharpness 0 0 5 0  8 8 8 0  0Color  50 50 50 44  54 46 46 50  50Tint  50/50 50/50 50/50 48/52  53/47 50/50 50/50 50/50 50/50Black Tone off off off off  off off off off offDynamic  off off off off  off off off off offgamma  -1 -1 -1 0  -1 -1 -2 0 0Flesh Tone 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0Edge Enhance off off off off  off off off off offMotion Light off off off off  off off off off offxvYcc  off off off off  off off off off offColor Tone warm2 warm2 warm2 warm2  warm2 warm2 warm2 warm2 warm2Digital Noise off off off off  off off off off offmpeg Noise off off off off  off off off off offColor SpaceRed_r  48 39 43 36  32 27 27 47 46Red_g  6 6 6 50  8 3 3 5 6Red_b  6 5 5 50  6 3 3 4 5Green_r  20 20 14 60  19 18 18 19 16Green_g  54 50 50 50  45 48 48 58 55Green_b  3 6 1 20  2 2 2 3 0Blue_r  3 1 3 40  0 0 0 3 3Blue_g  3 3 0 20  0 0 0 3 3Blue_b  50 41 47 50  36 48 48 53 54Yellow_r 53 51 48 50  48 47 47 51 46Yellow_g 53 51 50 50  47 48 48 54 51Yellow_b 6 7 5 2  8 4 4 4 4Cyan_r  17 18 15 20  22 19 19 20 14Cyan_g  52 48 49 46  46 46 46 53 53Cyan_b  52 48 51 46  44 48 48 51 50Magenta_r 47 41 44 40  33 30 30 42 42Magenta_g 8 6 6 3  6 3 3 8 8Magenta_b 57 48 48 47  44 50 50 53 54White Balancer-offset 26 22 25 28  24 26 26 30 30g-offset 25 26 25 22  25 25 25 14 14b-offset 22 25 25 22  27 25 25 12 10r-gain  13 30 25 28  25 28 28 7 0g-gain  25 25 25 24  25 25 25 21 24b-gain  29 27 30 24  27 25 25 19 1710-pointr1  0 -1 1 0  1 -1 -1 -7 -8g1  0 -1 0 0  1 0 0 -8 -8b1  0 0 1 1  1 1 1 -7 -7r2  0 2 -4 0  3 -1 -1 -5 -1g2  0 1 -3 0  2 0 0 -4 0b2  0 2 -4 0  3 1 1 -4 -1r3  1 0 1 0  1 -1 -1 3 3g3  0 0 1 0  1 -1 -2 3 5b3  0 -2 0 0  -1 -2 -5 3 6r4  0 1 0 0  0 -5 -5 1 1g4  0 0 1 0  0 -4 -4 2 5b4  0 -1 1 -1  -1 -4 -4 3 6r5  0 0 2 -1  -2 -3 -3 -1 0g5  1 1 2 0  -2 -3 -3 2 4b5  2 -3 3 1  -4 -5 -5 5 6r6  -2 0 1 -1  -1 -2 -2 -3 -3g6  0 0 1 0  1 -2 -2 -2 0b6  0 1 2 1  -1 -2 -2 -1 1r7  1 1 0 0  -1 -1 -1 -5 -5g7  2 1 0 0  -1 -1 -1 -3 -1b7  2 2 0 0  1 2 2 -3 -1r8  -2 -1 -1 0  0 0 0 -4 -6g8  0 0 -1 0  0 0 0 -2 -2b8  0 1 -1 0  2 0 0 -3 -4r9  0 -1 0 0  0 0 0 -2 -5g9  2 -1 0 0  0 0 0 0 0b9  -2 1 -1 0  0 0 0 -2 -2r10  0 1 1 0  0 0 0 -2 -6g10  2 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0b10  -2 3 -3 0  0 0 0 -7 -7", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture...Awesome product...Unfinished features.", "Author": "Matt J.

The \"printable\" manual on Samsung's site is the same e-manual...and it's hard to navigate without a lot of detail.Picture Quality: 5-starsThe display quality is amazing. I have had a few LCDs and nothing compares to the quality of this plasma. I have done some basic calibration and don't have that \"it's not right\" feeling. I know that a spider or similar product can get it closer, but each channel and source is good-enough that I am not tempted to change it every time.Tuning: 3-starsI can adjust 100 different colors, tints, brightness, contrast, etc. Almost everything I could imagine to get this doing what it is suppose to. The dings are: Color Calibration Screen - It only appears when you select it...then goes away when you try to adjust the color settings...WHAT'S THE POINT? Why are some features greyed out!? and...why can't I have multiple custom calibrations? Day/night/DVD/Bluray/etc? Fortunately the color is good enough that I don't have to.Features - Internet Widgets: 2-starsThese are bogus. This would receive a 1-star if I didn't have Netflix/Hulu/AllShare. They work quite well - especially Allshare. I use PlayOn/PlayLater for DVR of shows. It plays them seamlessly and does not require my GoogleTV anymore. Everything else is just useless bling. They are SLOW and cluttered. The Web browser is useless and far from integrated. It takes 5-minutes to do a Google search and has limited integration. The remote is suppose to make it easier, but good luck trying to figure out when you can use the remote controll to type or requires the directional pad to type one-letter at a time using a phone-pad style keyboard. The Social TV is painful - your facebook app looks like something out of the original Nintendo, the GoogleTalk is a guessing game..and shows every contact you ever had. No quick feature to find people you may want to chat with....Then... it only works when it is active taking up 90% of the screen. These applications and widgets DO NOT RUN IN THE BACKGROUND. The Yahoo-Hotapps - useless - why do I have to select widgets that I would expect to be instant when I have to click on each one to find out what the temperature is, or what's ending on ebay? Where's my email?General Settings and Configs - 1-starHDMI-CEC/Anynet+ - Awesome feature...HORRIBLE implementation by Samsung. I turn my TV on and it changes my stereo off the HDMI signal that the TV is plugged into, requiring me to change it back manually every time.HDMI-CEC/Anynet+ - Can control my stereo and shut it off autmatically....but no option to auto-turn on...requiring manual power-on...then it changes the source...Why is there not a simple option!?Audio Return Channel - Great idea - I can plug all my sources into my TV. That way I have no issues with running 3D. BUT, Samsung will only output 2.1 audio through ARC (audio return channel). If you want 5.1, you have to run toslink ...and I am not ever sure if that will work as expected.Please note: if you have OTA digital channels - it will output 5.1 to your AV-Receiver..but that's it.Picture-in-Picture - Another nice feature...but will only output OTA signals...you cannot change it. That's the only option you get. You cannot play PS3 and watch football.Might I add, some of the applications crash periodically, causing the TV to freeze, create some sort of unhandled error, and then reboot. *shrug*These are the type of lack-luster-features that I would expect from a Chinese iPod clone. It plays music great, but doesn't resume where you left off, the shuffle plays the same list each time, the digital-out control only works on 5.1 recorded music...etc.If you're looking for a great picture..you can't go wrong here. If you're concerned about the \"extras\" ..this is not the TV you're looking for. I suspect and hope that Samsung will improve many of these issues, but if Samsung development process is anything like their phones...I am not holding my breath - I know I will simply have to buy the next years model to get the fixes needed.Support SammyGo - They are going to the be saving grace to this disaster product.The review sites out there did not have the TV long enough to appreciate the nuances - If I had to do it again, I would take a serious look at the Panasonics to see if they have a more mature product.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Screen Cracked with no trauma- All over the INTERNET", "Author": "SCOTT SILVESTRY \"SS STL\"", "ReviewID": "R22LUF9AC0I4HK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV last year.

I did some online research and I found hundreds of complaints over the exact same spider cracking issue so obviously this is a defect of some kind. After going back and forth with them for some time I decided to let it go since the cracks were barely noticable while the tv was on and didnt hinder its performance at all. However, yesterday a 6\" horizontal band and a 3\" vertical band appeared blocking out a good portion of my picture. My warranty expires in a few days and I just opened another ticket with Samsung over this new issue which I am sure they will blame on me somehow.

(JULY 11 Mfg Date)Out of the box, the picture on this is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!In Movie Mode the blacks are extremely deep, and the colors very accurate.Right now, I have the contrast turned down until I've broken it in for at least 200 hrs.I have this in my living room with 4 floor to ceiling windows all of which have blinds.The room gets bright, but this TV displays perfectly in my well lit room.To address certain issues others are experiencing....BUZZING:  I have very acute hearing, and I haven't noticed any noise at all.SCREEN PEELING:  None yet, but I'm not too worried about it as Samsung will repair any peeling issues.BURN IN:  None yet as I always do a break in first, and always utilize the screen saver.BRIGHTNESS POPS:  Yes, they do exist in certain dark to light changes.However, mine are so quick and subtle that if I wasn't looking for them based on other reviews, I'd honestly probably wouldn't notice them. These are not a deal breaker for me. Look at the reviews of the Panasonic VT30; they apparently suffer from it also.The pops are so few, far between, and subtle, that I can certainly live with it.SPEAKERS:  They're not the greatest, but get the job done.  Let's be realistic, what would you expect from a 1.5\" thick TV.If you buy a TV in this price range, I would think you'd want to pair it with at least a good 5.1 system.3D:  SIMPLY AMAZING. IMAX Creatures of the Deep had my 3yr old son hide behind his mom when the cod fish came out hovering over our coffee table. LOL.SPORTS:  One word, OMG!!GAMES:  I read a lot of reviews talking about ghosting.Some games do a bit, some don't. But think about it.If you're so into games, that you notice ghosting, buy a high end PC Monitor with a 2ms refresh rate.You won't get a higher refresh rate on a TV other than a plasma.COD MW3 looks amazing. I've been in the tech field for 15 years, and have built high end custom gaming PC's on the side.The only thing that looks better than this plasma is a PC teamed with a $600 DX11 video card and high end monitor at 180 fps.MOVIES:  BREATHTAKING!  This is how films are meant to look.The LED I had purchased prior, left a cheap \"daytime tv\" look, even after turning off the Aquos 240hz motion and turning on film mode.REMOTE CONTROL:  Pretty cool and it works but I use a Logitech universal which I really like to control all my components.APPS:  Nice to have, but I don't really use them.The built in media player works pretty good, but I already have a stand alone media player.The built in one will play 1080p 3D rips, and has played all the MKV's, MP4's, and AVI's that I've thrown at it for test.Again, being in the tech field for many years, ALL high end and even low end technology have some inherent issues.So, IMO, if you like games, movies, and sports, you definitely won't be disappointed in this TV from Samsung.It has the best picture I've seen in years besides the Pioneer Kuro.Just make sure to break it in first.UPDATE (1/27/2012) ------------------------Well, unfortunately I have to lower my review on the 64\" D8000.  After less than a week, the screen started going black periodically, and remained black for 5-10 seconds.  At first, I thought it was my cable box, but it progressively got worse.Then it started happening while watching my Apple TV.  So I then thought it could be the receiver.  I bypassed my Pioneer receiver, and guess what....still going out.  Even tried a different HDMI cable.  So I contacted Samsung.  USELESS!  Their tech support guy told me to reset the TV to the factory default (TV was still on factory default except for a lower contrast), then had me update the firmware to the same version I was already running.  USELESS TECH SUPPORT.  Needless to say that I was within my return date from the store I had purchased it from, and my problem was progressively getting worse and more frequent.I returned the Samsung, and was not willing to take another chance at a potentially faulty screen.  My thoughts were, \"What if this one waits until after 30 days until it goes out?\"  Based on Samsung's tech support, I was NOT going to do this again, not for $3k.Anyway, I'm lowering my review to 3 stars.  The picture was AMAZING, but the quality and tech support were not up to par.I guess being an Apple guy, I have higher expectations from tech support and quality.I picked up the Panasonic TC-P65VT30 yesterday.

We have the 59\" 8000, purchased from Amazon. Delivery was quick and arrived in the time window we requested. They unboxed it and made sure everything was working before leaving. We have three HD televisions in our house and this is by far the best.The break it down.PROs - Picture is bright and crisp. - 3D is surprisingly good (source dependent). - Good connections for peripherals. - Very thin, beautiful design.CONs - Smart menu and functions are not that usable. - QWERTY remote has very limited functionality. - QWERTY remote is NOT universal. - Smart functions are very slow. - No Amazon Instant Video (not even through Yahoo Apps)DETAILSTo be fair, we did not use the picture settings out of the box. I did some research based on another Amazon review and slightly modified the settings. It is VERY nice. One thing that really surprised us was the quality of the 3D. I will reiterate that this is dependent upon the source. 3D quality is also significantly improved by dimming the lights in the room. The most impressive 3D we've seen is from Halo Anniversary on the XBox 360. With regard to connections, I'm able to run HDMI from all my devices directly into the TV, and then run an Optical Audio out to the surround receiver, meaning fewer connections and a single setting for the surround receiver. One slight complaint is that the connections all point to the left of the television, and all of my peripherals are located in the cabinet down and to the right of the television, but this is minor.One big disappointment was the Smart functionality, which I was very excited about one something that drew us to Samsung. It is very slow to start up. I find myself clicking on the Smart Hub button and waiting for menu to appear. QWERTY functions for on the Smart Hub interface itself, but quite often, once you get into an application like Netflix, you have to do all entry with the onscreen keyboard using the remotes 4-way controller. Starting applications from this screen is once again slow, although some are faster than others. Internet connectivity to the box does not seem to be managed well either. We have a 20 MB pipe which is very consistent and I have the TV connected directly to the router bypassing the switch. Playback for streaming HD (especially 3D) often stutters and sometimes just stops, which doesn't happen with other equipment performing the same functionality. We were also disappointed that the QWERTY remote cannot be programmed to control other equipment. For such a complicated remote, I would think this would be a given. Needless to say, we've pretty much abandoned the Smart functionality and use the XBox instead.SUMMARYI would buy this product again. Regardless of our disappointment in the Smart Hub functionality, the television just looks that good and is worth the price.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful TV... but the buzzing bothers", "Author": "biele krolik", "ReviewID": "R25V0T5153O5QB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this TV... haven't had a chance to calibrate or test all the features yet, but I am really happy with the overall image and sound quality.After reading so many reviews, I was worried about the peeling and the buzzing issues. I haven't seen any signs of peeling yet, but the buzzing is always there. This is my first plasma set, so I was not aware of the \"common\" buzzing issue with the technology. I thought it was brand or model specific, but I have read some technical explanations of why these plasma TVs have the buzzing. In short, the buzz is the artifact of the images being generated on the screen. So, all plama sets supposedly buzz, but some people may notice it more than others.I sit 12 feet away from the TV and the buzzing bothers me a lot if the volume is under 7. Samsung's e-manual talks about the buzzing, but they do not consider it an issue. If you contact their customer service, they will tell you to create a service request, which I haven't done because I believe that in the end the technician will say that there is no buzz or that there is nothing that can be done about it. I thought about returning the set and trying a new one, but chances are the buzz will be there again... so not really worth the trouble. I guess I just have to live with it for the wonderful image (I tried an LED at store and it's incredible how fragile they are and how much the image quality deteriorates as the viewing angle changes), so I'm sticking with plasma.3D, Blue Ray and the apps all work fine... there is a multitude of things to try... I am just a little disappointed with the Yahoo Widgets and that you cannot use the QWERTY remote to search on Youtube... hopefully they will fix that with an upgrade.Overall, very nice TV.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, great picture, so so apps", "Author": "Obnubilated", "ReviewID": "R2DYEJE17L58SL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After going through three of the Panasonic TC-P50GT30s, all of which had the \"green blob\" problem, flickering brightness and the loud buzzing issue, I decided I'd had enough and got the Samsung PN51D8000. I'm so glad I did, although the Samsung is more expensive, I managed to get the package deal that came with a Blu-ray player and two 3-D glasses for about the same going price as the TV alone.Picture:Right out of the box, the picture was very good...not perfect, but surprisingly good. The color uniformity of the screen is SO much better than the Panasonic. No green blotches, no over saturated red/pink in skin tones, no white bloom. Yay! There are a lot of picture tuning options in the configuration menu and you can get a really good picture with just those options. There are a few little differences in the picture menu compared to the Panasonic which I really appreciated, the best one is the ability to change panel brightness as well as the standard picture brightness function. This makes it easy to brighten or dim the screen without washing out the picture or losing shadow detail. The Samsung is just a pinch behind the Panasonic when it comes to displaying true HD content, the Panasonic can really look tight and crisp at 1080p when it's not being green. The difference is very small however and most people probably won't notice unless they've owned both.I play a lot of video games on my Xbox, so latency and motion blur were important to me. I haven't seen any motion blur in games or movies so far, I was surprised. As far as latency goes with gaming consoles, as long as you have all of the picture tuning gizmos turned off, it works just fine. There's also a Game Mode that will do all that for you in one click but I found it was way too bright and contrasty and I had to tune the settings to my liking. One disturbing thing I noticed is that the manual says \"Do not display a still image (such as on a video game) longer than several minutes as it can cause image retention. This image retention is also known as screen burn.\" Wow...several minutes? I wonder how many minutes that is...not enough to play a video game or watch broadcast TV with a logo on the corner. I assume this is meant to scare you, so that they don't have to deal with burn in complaints.Sound:The built in speakers are just fine for watching things at moderate volume, they are small but clear unless you crank the volume way up. I have the TV connected to my home theatre, so I don't care much about the speakers. If you are running your TV through a receiver and you want to watch online programming through the built in SmartTV hub using digital sound, know that you need either a newer receiver with an ARC HDMI port that will return sound to your speakers OR a TOSlink cable to run sound to your optical port on your receiver. I do not have an ARC port, so I use a TOSlink (hint: buy a long one in case you ever move your components).Apps:Meh. Most of the Samsung apps are crap unless you're 5 years old. YouTube and Netflix are nice, but my Xbox outputs a higher quality Netflix picture than the the TV does. Samsung told me I could download Amazon Video via Yahoo! widgets. NOT TRUE! Samsung is severing ties with Yahoo! and there is no Amazon app for newer TV models or for the Blu-ray player. They say they are going to make everything a native SmartTV app \"soon\". Also, the interface for SmartTV is slow and has waaaaay too many menu layers. The Panasonic is superior in this area, with simple menus and a fast interface....and Amazon Video.Build Quality:Well, the Samsung is lighter and thinner by a little bit if that matters to you.The problem with this is that the metal cover on the back of the TV is thin and not well supported. I found this out while installing the stand, I put my hand on the back of the TV to move it and the metal popped inward and dented a little. I also have a center channel shelf that braces on the back of the TV and it was bowing the metal backing inward. I ended up making long shims to distribute the weight across the braced part of the backing. The TV is also a bit wobbly compared to the Panasonic which was stiff and sturdy. Part of the reason for this is the spindly spider leg stand they put on these. I personally dislike this stand and wish they had a nice big square foot like other TVs. Some people may prefer the minimalist/modern look of the chrome feet. That said, I don't touch my TV and I don't have kids or pets, so it's not going to get knocked over.The Buzz:Wow, this TV is so much quieter that the Panasonic! All three of the GT30s I tried buzzed loud enough to be annoying at 10 feet. I can't hear the Samsung at all unless I put my head near it or display a super bright white field, like a test slide. This is a huge selling point for me, I have very good hearing and little noises like that make me crazy.On the whole, this is a better TV than the Panasonic and I'm very happy with it. So glad I coughed up the extra money for this unit.EDIT: I'd also like to thank Amazon for providing such excellent customer service with the three Panasonic units I had to return. Delivery time was fast and on schedule and so was the return pickup. Customer service was fast, helpful and I got no pushback or denial about the issues the three TVs had. The delivery company (CEVA) that they work with in my area were super polite, tidy and did all of the setup and breakdown for me.

I can say that the picture is the best I have seen on HD content but SD channels look much worse than my previous SXRD LCD. Also, the SD settings available to stretch the image are poor since they don't allow me to stretch the image and fill the screen fully with no bars. I was worried about this, mainly because of image retention issues possibly occurring but have had no issues thus far. There is an option on the other hand to zoom the picture and fill the screen but cuts quite a bit of the image off on all sides. Blu-ray is impeccable and so are games driven by the PS3. Batman Arkham City in 3D is quite good and has relieved me of any worries on how games would handle this fairly new technology. Mortal Kombat isn't quite as believable or accurate in its attempt to reproduce 3D. A high speed HDMI cable is recommended and truth be known, the cable that Direct TV installed worked fine to carry the 3D signal and was \"free\", if you don't have one around I suggest either getting a Blue Jeans Cable brand from Amazon or going to Monoprice's website to purchase one. Audio is actually quite good for the small dimensions available to place speakers, but just a note if you plan to use the Smart Hub housing the various applications available and you want to use your surround sound setup, you have to run a cable from the TV to your audio receiver, since the source originates in the TV itself. This means you will have 2 cables going from the TV to the reciever, either another HDMI or an optical digital cable is what I would recommend. If you don't plan to get this TV calibrated by a professional, which I recommend, there are several forums that can steer your settings in the right direction and I suggest trying them all and see what looks best to your eyes. I hope this helps in your important decision and suggest that you get a Blu-ray player and every HD channel that you care to watch if you decide on this model, because if the majority of your viewing consists of SD offerings you will most likely be disappointed.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Plasma 3D 51\" HDTV", "Author": "P.

I only have two minor gripes.  Imbeded somewhere in the television's software is a two inch square picture of a speaker with a red slash across it.  It has been programmed to move up the screen on the left, and down the screen.  Up and Down.  I called Samsung to learn how to disable this, and was told that there is no way, and that I was the first to complain about it. Since this is a smart tv, and if more people will complain about it, maybe there will be a fix in the next edition of firmware.The second minor issue is the lack of an analogue audio output to speakers.  The only output provided is an optical digital.  This seems to be the way big screen tvs are going.  You are supposed to buy a powered soundbar with an optical input like the Zvox.  Since I already have a pair of M-Audio A-40 monitors M-Audio Studiophile AV 40 Powered Speakers (Previous Version) that are perfectly acceptable, I can't justify buying another speaker system.  Amazon comes to the rescue again.  I got the Fiio D3 digital FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter - 192kHz/24bit Optical and Coaxial DAC to analogue converter for $28. Then I ran the optical cable from the TV to the converter, and standard RCA cables from the converter to the powered speakers. Listening to a couple of DVDs including the new Jeff Beck tribute to Les Paul, Jeff Beck Rock'n'Roll Party: Honoring Les Paul [Blu-ray] I am thoroughly pleased.  Great dynamics and accuracy. Unfortunately, the optical digital outlet cannot be muted.  So, for normal tv listening with commercials, I will use the in TV speakers which aren't awful.This TV does run HOT.  Unfortunately, the chosen location is over my thermostat. I will have to move it. The room temperature was 64 degrees, and in back of the tv it measured 72 degrees, a plus 8 degrees!

This was after three service orders and writing to the Office of the President, presenting a formal complaint.The good things about the Sammy PN59D8000: Slim modern design.  Great picture quality especially with B/R 3-D. Wide viewing angle.  Removable base that allows wall mounting.  Plenty of inputs and outputs.The bad things about the Sammy PN59D8000:* Internal speakers sound is mediocre making you need an external device for proper audio listening, especially with the high and low bass frequencies.* Optical and sound digital output do not provide the 5.1 sound advertised.  You need an Amplifier/Receiver/Surround Bar Decoder to get the full 5.1 effect.  I have it with a 7.2 thanks to an Onkyo amplifier and supplemental speakers and sub-woofers.* TV Outputs; HDMI and USB will not allow you to see or record TV programs as advertised by Samsung.  Note that Samsung's website even advertised specific storage devices made by WD to save recorded programs.* Even though mislead, as of March 2014, the TV still does not have the capability of installing the Amazon Prime TV feature for those of us who are subscribed.  You might need to buy a Roku or a Google Chrome to get Amazon Prime movies.* The Remote Control is a nightmare and a battery drainer.  Mine was replaces twice and ended up getting a Logitech complementary RC to be able to properly program recordings on the TV.* The 3-D features are cumbersome as even though you need to wear the 3-D glasses included, it is a nightmare.  Samsung TVs have three separate settings for watching 3-D.  Horizontal, diagonal or side to side depending on the source.  The major problem is that if you are watching a 3-D  movie on any of the formats and you pause it, even with the glasses, you need to return the TV to the original 2-D format to even read/see what is next.  Crazy!!!* As all Plasma TVs, this Sammy Plasma gets the room very warm, unlike my old Sony LCD Bravia from 2005 which does not generate any heat at all and after almost a decade, still works perfectly.Thus, if you have read my review up to this part, consider getting a Panasonic, a Sony LCD or even an LG TV.  Have seen all these three and much better and cheaper alternatives than the Samsung PN59D8000 3-D Plasma.  As of March 2014, 3-D TV features are not worth.I invite you to research on the legal suits against Samsung for false advertisement of several of the issues above mentioned.

You may not need a sound bar if you are used to the sound from an old tube tv.The 3d is amazing, but it takes a while to get used to because of the edge effects and other issues that affect the realism, such as the fact that moving one's head does not change the apparent point of view.The 3d is full 1084p which makes it look better than the Lg 3D.Streaming content from Netflix is excellent. The tv works with the new 30 fps content.Cons:The Internet browser is very difficult to use, especially because of the remote control.Why so much for the Internet capability when so many relatively inexpensive Internet capable devices already have the capability, such as the excellent Panasonic blue ray player?The 3d feature is not something that really gets used that much and it adds so much cost to the tv.The 3d glasses are relatively expensive and the batteries don't last long. No free glasses come with the tv. The on button becomes difficult to activate after some use.The plasma screen is very fragile.  I have owned 2 of these tvs because my toddler destroyed the first one.  He cracked the plasma screen without the slightest scratch on the glass! We have our second tv mounted over the mantle. I hope that he does not throw anything at this one.  LCD and led tvs are more resistant to damage. In any case, don't fall for the claims that a super strong glass layer will make the screen indestructible.

I ended up paying about $700 less than if I had got it at Best Buy (when you add in the sales tax I didn't have to pay).  I was originally interested the 65\" Samsung they had at Costco that was an LED.  Funny enough the LED was much more expensive than the plasma.  According to CNET the plasma has a more even picture.  Well since I don't have the tools to measure the picture I just had to take their word for that.  I got the Plasma because it was much cheaper (if you can believe that) and have not been disapointed with regular viewing.  The picture quality on Blu-ray is way beyone what was expected.  The new Tron movie is so sharp and clear it is spooky.  You can't watch that movie without being totally amazed.  I do have a gripe but not one big enough to not give this 5 stars.  The 3D picture is darker and not as sharp, than the non-3D.  Clearly it is because of the shaded glasses.  This isn't much of an issue for me because 3D was just something this TV did, not the reason I bought it.  I wanted the most amazing picture I could find for a reasonable price.  I believe I got just that.  Also, I think this is the best looking TV out there.

I had seen the Samsung in a local electronics store and, compared to the Panasonic, (to me) it \"looked\" better even though the advertised performance was supposed to be very similar. This of course could be due to a variety of reasons (calibration, ambient lighting, etc.). I read a lot of reviews talking about buzzing and contrast flashing with the SAMSUNG. So far (about 3 weeks) I have not experienced any of these problems.Out of the box the picture is fantastic. The picture is very crisp and color does not vary with viewing angle (as expected with a plasma). Blacks are rendered much better than my older Sony 40\" LCD and much better than other LED/LCD tv's I have seen recently.The 3D performance is amazing. I didn't expect a TV to produce the same 3D effect I have seen in theaters but it is very close. By the way, the 2012 Samsung active 3D glasses (SSG-4100gb) work wonderfully. They are much less bulky than the 3050's from 2011. I did not purchase rechargeable 3D glasses so I can't comment on those.I have also seen poor reviews on the delivery service used by Amazon for this type of item. My experience was very good. The TV arrived on time and within 30 minutes of the beginning of the scheduled delivery window. The poor reviews on delivery could be a regional issue.

Great TV for the money!", "Author": "NKC", "ReviewID": "R2IZGIZKX9T4GO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After extensive research, I zeroed in on the PN64D8000 from Samsung for a few reasons.  First, I wanted a big screen and was only looking at 60 inches and above.  Second, I was planning on hanging the TV on the wall....so an exceptionally thin tv was important for the best look.  Third, I wanted all the bells and whistles...3D capabilities, built in wifi, as well as a terrific picture of course!  My conclusions:  Sony just can't compete anymore, they are way overpriced compared to the competition and still 2.5 inches thick...no wonder the firm lost over $6 billion and laid off 10,000 employees last quarter!  While Sharp makes the biggest LED TV's at 80 inches, they are still too clunky to hang on the wall for my taste since they are 4 inches thick...and their 70 inch LED TV isnt much better at 3.5 inches thick.  While LG and Panasonic makes a nice TV for the money, I found Samsung to be the best.  They are the thinnest and with the samsung WMN2000C Ultra Slim Wall Mount, they literally mount like a picture and are exceptionally close to the wall.I think the picture is pretty darn fantastic on all these TV's so I relied on 3rd party reviews to conclude that the Samsung PN64D8000 offers one of the best pictures of all TV's released in 2011.  I went into my search thinking that I was going to be buying a 65 inch LED TV (probably the UN65D8000), but I found that Plasma is actually superior to LED in many ways...blacker blacks, deals better with quick motion for watching sports and action movies, no light inthe corner of the screen from the LED dimming, and substantially cheaper!  Plasma is not quite as energy efficient as LED technology, but the average energy bill is still only $40 per year if you watch 5 hours of tv a day...pretty negligible difference to the comprable LED tv which has an average electric bill of $25 per year.So, when Amazon Warehouse Deals had the PN64D8000 offered in \"Used-Like New\" condition for $1815.00 with free shipping and no tax, I didnt hesitate and immediately scooped it.  The TV showed up 3-days later in its original packaging and as far I could tell the box had never even been opened...it was brand new!  I bought the \"Used-Like New\" Samsung wall mount from warehouse deals for $45 (listed for over $90 new on Amazon) to complete the deal.  Very easy to install yourself, I had the TV set up and mounted on the wall in 30 minutes.  For comparison, the UN65D8000 would have cost me upwards of $3,000 so with this much in savings for the plasma that actually received better reviews than the LED version in terms of picture quality made it a no brainer!The only cons are the qwerty remote is not universal so you cant program your cable box remote to change channels, etc...  Also, although the qwerty remote makes it easier to browse the internet, just know that it still doesnt take the place of a laptop or tablet.  The internet through a tv is still slower and somewhat annoying to use...I will pull out my laptop everytime!  The value is really in the built-in wifi connectivity and the ability to access on-demand content or movies through Netflix, HuluPlus, etc...  In this regard, the PN64D7000 might be an okay choice but just realize that you are also giving up a little in picture quality too since the PN64D8000 has a superior contrast ratio.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung 64\" plasma 8000 series", "Author": "SBoll", "ReviewID": "R39DVK6446YHGX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture's great.

After wading through the finer points of Plasma verses LED-LCD and edge verses backlit, this plasma began to stand out. The primary area of interest of any Television is picture quality, the rest is secondary. The basics of the consideration were picture uniformity, fast-motion blur and black-level.Without going into the sorted details, plasma far exceeds led-lcd in eliminating fast-motion blur due to a native 600Hz refresh compared to the 120Hz refresh of most led-lcd displays (be careful of catch phrases like 240 clearview which are really 120Hz sets with weasle-words added to make you think you are getting a 240Hz set) The faster the better. Anything less than true 240Hz on the led-lcd side and you are asking for trouble.With the basic details sorted, the task became sorting out the best value and quality of a 55-60 in. set in the 1800 range. After going back an forth a few times, we decided on this model, the P59D8000. After a second run through the secondary comparisons, basically it was on par with the other offering and exceeded many by offering built in Wi-Fi (WPA security compatible) making it a simple addition to an existing wireless network.After receipt of the TV and initial configuration -- I'm impressed. Consistent with the reviews, picture quality is superb. Deep blacks and crisp color separation and no fast motion blur. Internet setup and configuration was a breeze, even with MAC access table restrictions and WPA encryption. The initial firware update was simple and the internet applications in the \"Smart Hub\" suite of applications automatically update when needed.Now that is not to say everything is \"perfect\". Since every manufacturer is still learning how to combine a Television and the Internet, there is much room for improvement in the layout of the web and application interface, but for the most part, everything works solidly. Of particular note, and to Samsung's credit, it includes the open-source Nautilus web browser relabeled as the samsung web-browser. Which for all practical purposes works well on-screen, although the remote and bluetooth mouse navigation makes surfing on the TV a bit challenging.The only issue encountered so far is the QWERTY keyboard \"de-pairing\" from the TV's bluetooth. A quick call to Samsung and a firmware update have seemed to improve the issue.All and all at this price point, it will be hard to find a better picture and suite of secondary options to match.

Most everything about the set was fair (aesthetics) to excellent (resolution, black levels), but one problem made the set impossible to watch: snow. There is a graininess in the picture that I subsequently found reported elsewhere, and that simply ruins everything that is good about the set. After jumping through the hoops with ill-informed Panasonic customer service, I returned the set (thanks amazon), and decided to throw my budgetary constraints to the wind: after reading all the reviews online, and deciding not to go with Panasonic again, I decided to go for Samsung's top of the line plasma. Truly, an epic disappointment. The color is better, and the snow is gone, but the blacks, or lack thereof . . . the blooming blacks, the rings and rings of different shades of greys and blacks that are constantly being created on the screen like rain on a puddle . . . kill all of my enthusiasm about newer T.V. technology. I just finished watching the seventh Harry Potter on blu ray, and there was so much blooming (sorry I don't know the technical term, but I hope you know what I am referring to), that I literally had to stop the movie, print up some of the recommended calibrations I had found online, and try recalibrating--with even worse results.

Ultimately I decided it was the way to go due to the great response rate and the fact that I can't stand the anti-judder 'soap opera' effects of LCD technology.  I followed all of the guidelines - I reduced brightness and contrast to 50%, I ran color slides and only full-screen content for the first 200 hours, and I didn't play any games on the set at all until after the break-in period.  After breaking in the set, I thought it would be safe to play a game.  I switched on the game mode and played Borderlands for a few hours.  Anyone who has played this game knows that each time players enter a new area the screen is filled with a color swirl, and that frequent inventory checks change the screen as well.  Static images are not displayed for a great length of time.  After approximately four hours, I turned the game off and ran the screen wipe.  At this point I noticed that the heads up display was burned into the screen.  I checked the settings and discovered that switching to game mode had changed the TV to the 'standard' setting which has much higher contrast and brightness levels.  Having read about image retention, I was not overly concerned.  I adjusted the standard settings for game mode to half brightness and contrast and held off on playing games until I could clear the image retention.  Months later, after running only full-screen content and using static patterns in an effort to remove the burn-in, I finally called Samsung.  I was told that the higher contrast and brightness settings in game mode were deliberate and were intended to give a 'more vibrant and realistic gaming experience.'  I was also told that gaming for more than an hour on this television was not recommended.  I told them that I felt that having the game mode raise brightness and contrast settings to potentially damaging levels was a flaw in the programming of the television, at which point they told me that they were very sorry, but their warranty did not cover burn-in.  If you research burn-in, you will find that most people claim that it is a non-issue at this point.  Burn-in IS real and IS still an issue.  Bottom line: if you plan to use your television for gaming, Samsung will not take responsibility for deliberately programming their game mode in such a way that it can permanently damage your set.  Having said all of that, the picture quality of this set is amazing, and if you plan to only watch full-screen content and not play games, you should be fine (unless you watch channels with static tickers or logos).  Just remember though, if anything does happen, you're on your own.Update:  I have clocked many more hours of gaming on this television, and now that the game mode brightness and contrast levels have been corrected, I have not had any further issues.

Having moved to a much bigger place, I needed a bigger TV for my Family Room. As I had gone with LCD previously, that was my obvious choice.Only to find everything is now classed as LED. I found this to be a major difference and step back in technology. I got through a Samsung and two Sharps, all had serious 'blooming/flashlight' issues....ie on dark scenes it was like someone was shining a flashlight at the TV screen, plus in all 3 there was considerable bleeding problems at the corners of the screen, with more white trying to encroach on the picture.I am a very informed consumer and found out that these issues are common with LED technology, often caused by screws being over tightened at the factory, causing an almost bruising effect on the screen. I tried loosening screws, but obviously the damage had already been done. If you do your research and Google all major LED brands you will find similar complaints.I was very reticent to even consider Plasma, as they all seem to have the same highly reflective gloss screen, which does not work in my room with so much light. However there seems to be an exception to this rule and that is this TV, as they have added an anti glare surface which really works, only thing is this has started to peel for many users, but in later sets it would seem they have resolved this. I will be monitoring mine!Others complain about the audio, I don't really know anyone who would spend $3k on a TV and not have a sound system. So to me, that is not a justified criticism.As for picture quality,  it cannot be bettered, Dark intense blacks and vivid colors make for an amazing experience. Many mention a buzz, on my TV it is very slight and not an issue. I think the picture has amazing contrast for a Plasma, providing something more like an LCD effect - and of course being Plasma, there are no 'flashlight; issues on a dark screen.Amazons delivery service could not have been nicer and it was great that they include 'white glove' ie., unpacking the TV and installing the stand. This weekend I made the ultimate commitment and wall mounted the TV, it looks even more amazing, plus in my opinion the stand is ugly !!!I totally understand why C-Net consider this one of the best TV's of 2011 and hopefully with the peeling issue solved, it will be hanging on my wall bringing pleasure for many years to come.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Fantastic", "Author": "K.

Not to get into the LED vs Plasma debate, but I'm glad I went Plasma.  It's fantastic.  And so far, I have not had any of the issues reviewers of this Samsung complain about: peeling screen film, brightness popping, buzzing, etc.  If there is popping I am not enough of a videophile to know I'm witnessing it, because the picture is flawless.  Numerous friends and family have stood with jaw dropped shaking there head at the high definition picture.  Football is scary realistic.  Movies are breathtaking.  And I had no intention of liking 3D, but wow...it's cool!  Now I surf Direct TV guide and record 3D shows and movies to watch.  3D is actually pretty amazing on this TV.  I will advise going into the setup and setting the 3D depth to maximum, before I did that it was uninspiring, but after setting it to max...WOW!  Our kids kept trying to reach into the TV and screaming when things would come there way.My only negative remark is the sluggishness of the Smart TV features.  My Sony Blu Ray is even slower, but compared to a PC, or even my iPhone, I can't understand why the TV's apps, Netflix, Vudu, etc are so slow to load.  Also, the keypad and \"pointer\" on the QWERTY remote are not available for all applications when you need to type, that is so frustrating I often just give up.  Once I connect my iMac to the TV this will not be an issue, but if you really wanted to utilize the Smart features stand-along, prepare to be frustrated.Buying from Amazon on Cyber Monday brought a pretty nice price, and it arrived within a week.  Glad I went through Amazon versus ordering from Best Buy (well, it was about $600 cheaper via Amazon so that wasn't a hard call).In summary, if my best friend asked me to recommend the best television on the market under $3,000 I'd probably recommend a Samsung 8000 series plasma.  59 inches is huge, glad I didn't go smaller, and not sure the extra 5 inches is worth the additional cost.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "bigc97", "ReviewID": "RBHMW24N2F1GH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just recently upgraded to this TV from a 6 year old Samsung DLP tv.

I really appreciate the minimalist design and the lack of flimsy, scratch prone, glossy, cheap black plastic that so prevalent in electronics these days.  I like the quad stand - a monolithic slab of cheap plastic that would show every scratch and collect dust just doesn't appeal to me.  I've noticed more manufacturers are following Samsung's lead with more creative stands on the 2012 models.The picture quality of this TV is awesome.  The colors are vibrant and the black are deep without overshadowing the rest of the picture.  And with Plasma technology there are no issues with motion, screen uniformity and off angle viewing.  The one weakness of the picture is the whites are a little washed out - a trait of plasmas.Since I'm using an external audio sound system my only comment on the speakers would be - why use them?  If you're willing to pay this much for a picture then at least get a decent audio system to get the full effect.  Some sound bars are quite good.The streaming features are adequate.  As long as the main applications work without drama I'm fine with it.  They're usually the ones you pay for on a monthly basis (Netflix, Hulu Plus) or by per movie/show (VUDU).  The one downside is that for Netflix you're very limited to the picture settings.  For VUDU you have full access to the picture menu.  Of course if you plan on watching blu-rays/DVDs from a blu-ray player you can use the online services from that player and utilize full pictures setting from your HDMI input.Now what makes this TV so frustrating - the buzz sound.  I noticed it as soon I turned the TV on.  It's a piercing sound that projects straightforward.  Sit off center by two feet and it can't be heard.  I suspect for those who mount their TV the buzz will be a non issue since it would be projected overhead.  I've noticed if I lay-down on the couch I can no longer hear it.From my research I've learned that there are two kinds of sounds that may be heard from a plasma, one from the screen (my case) and one from the power source which is a sound that is heard everywhere.I knew about the buzzing sound ahead of time but I didn't think it would bother me.  This TV replaced my Panasonic plasma and if it was emitting a buzz I wasn't hearing it.  I don't think the buzzing sound is on every TV or at least not to the same degree.I've returned this TV for a Samsung UN55D7000 and was fortunate enough to get the 303 screen.  Uniformity issues and edge lighting are minimum but to be frank the PN55D8000 has the better overall picture.  And in some scenes there are motion issues that plague ALL LCD TVs.Perhaps I should have ordered another PN59D8000 (heck, I went through the trouble of returning one, what's one more?) but the overall picture of the UN55D7000 is still impressive.  The negatives of my LED LCD TV are nitpicks and it's completely silent.An astute reader may ask why I didn't go with a Panasonic Plasma for a replacement.  1) I don't like the styling and the acres of cheap plastic, 2) They have their own known quality issues and 3) the model I would want has been sold out and I already sold my old Panasonic.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY!", "Author": "AK", "ReviewID": "RF32GE2JQLGZH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this plasma since I loved my first Samsung HDTV so much. Unfortunately, either I got a bad model or this product has quality issues with it's powerboard since I have had to get mine replaced twice now (each time it took nearly two weeks to get a service technician and he showed up with the wrong parts and had to come back again a week later). If they are going to offer a warranty you would think they would actually not make it so painful that you decide to never buy one of their products again. Unfortunately, they have succeeded with me and despite speific requests to have someone show up faster they are providing a two week lead time on repairing the TV this time as well.I suggest you go with a Sony or Panasonic since our other two large plamsas were made by them and they have been trouble free.

Having used LCDs for many years now, I feel like it's the first time I'm actually seeing true black on a TV.+Tons of nice features (wifi, samsung apps, very nice remote)+Beautifully designed, very sleek and slimI bought the TV through Paul's and it was shipped via Pilot Freight. TV shipped out very quickly, and Pilot did an excellent job with delivery. I was able to simply schedule a delivery date/time online (after TV had shipped). TV came in perfect condition, with a mfg date of December 2011. All around great service from amazon, pauls, and pilot. Hats off, delivering a 59'' plasma across the country is no easy task.Now onto the buzzing. First, let me state that this is not a huge issue at all. I have very acute hearing, and I barely noticed it. Other people in the room haven't noticed it at all. I discovered that the noise was very directional. I could hear it in one seat, and just one foot to the left it was silent. Note that this is while the TV was muted. With the TV on, I can only hear it during commercial changes. The noise itself also seems to vary based on the color the TV is displaying (pure whites and blacks result in the loudest buzz). Overall, a very minute issue. It seems like the longer the TV is on, the quieter the buzz gets. Regardless, in a few days the surround sound will be installed and this noise will be a thing of the past.Hands down the best TV I have ever used. I would recommend it to anyone looking for the best picture quality they can get (for the price). Be prepared to change your perception of what TV watching should be.And just a FYI, this TV weighs 100 pounds.

The stand is solid, and the swivel feature is awesome.  The view-ability isn't degraded by the well lit room.

I relocated the TV out of the direct sunlight and it hasn't happened again.  Only time will tell; but so far, the TV has the best picture quality I've ever seen and has performed exceptionally well for sports viewing and gaming.  The 3D up-convert works great.

My father is very frugal usually and getting him to purchase such an expensive TV was a task in itself, but I reassured him that Samsung products were best and that they have excellent customer service that I have read about many times.  Couple weeks ago we were watching TV and all of a sudden a four inch wide horizontal line is across the screen.  My dad thought it was Comcast but I knew it wasn't the minute I walked up to the TV.  The white bar goes closer to each edge than the Comcast picture.  Tried turning off and on and the white bar is right across the Samsung logo and for a few moments there are green speckles that fade away.My father upon seeing this wanted his money back.  The TV is only really used on the weekend when he is home.  I know Samsung doesn't care about how little it is used so I told him I would call and deal with it and see what they can do.  I called Samsung and gave them all the information they wanted.  I also ran the test image to confirm it was a TV issue.  They asked when I bought the TV and I said February 2012 and they said I had to prove it!  Okay why do I have to prove it before they send someone?  Can't the technician check my receipt?  I asked what's the fastest way to \"prove\" my purchase.  They gave me a crazy email address to send a PDF to.  So I did the scans and sent the message.  I asked the rep if she received my email. No sir the receipt goes into a queue and will be processed in two to three days.  I have to wait for them to review my receipt before they will do anything for me at all!Well waited until the following week.  Got an email saying my receipt was confirmed and my status was something along of the lines of ASR optimization in process or some other garbage.  Two days pass and I get another email saying my ticket was cancelled.  I called Samsung and the person on the phone has no idea why the ticket was cancelled.  She says she has to transfer me to executive support to answer my question.  So I tell the new person the whole story and they say the repair facility has cancelled the ticket and to please hold while she calls them to find out why.  The repair facility says the ticket was transferred to them from another facility and that since it was two days old they thought it was a mistake and canceled it without contacting Samsung or myself.  Samsung says the only thing they can do is recreate the ticket with the same repair company and it will take another 48 hours before they will contact me.In the mean time I decide to look up Lakes Electronics, the repair company.  Take some time and Google the for yourself and read the great horror stories about them.  I thought to myself well no big deal they are a big chain some people will have some problems.  This made my father even more angry and he insisted that either I stay home from work or he will to monitor the repair.Finally get a call from Lakes electronics to fix the TV last week.  Well we can't come this week the earliest was today (Monday).  No we can't schedule times for repair and we only repair until 3pm with two hours flex.  We don't work weekends.  Literally our only option was to take off work.  My father decided he would take off today to monitor the work done on the TV.  Well come this past Friday at 4pm my mother gets a phone call from Lakes Electronics.  We can't come to your house on Monday the parts haven't arrived yet.  What parts!?!?  I ended up calling them back from work and ask them how they can have parts on order when they haven't been to the house yet.  Well it's a common issue having vertical lines on the TV so we already ordered the parts to bring to your house. Which side of the TV is the line on sir? It's a horizontal line across the upper middle of the screen.  So what parts are you ordering?  Well sir we should still have the parts you need and we can't send anyone until we receive the parts which should be showing up on Monday.  Well my dad fortunately was able to cancel taking today off.  Called Lakes Electronics today and they actually got nasty with my mother telling her not to call them and they would call when they have the parts.Samsung has made this extremely painful and I don't even want to know how angry my father will be if this weekend this TV is still broken.  I'll update as this saga continues.Update 6/27/2012Making the review three stars from being one star.

I thought all the people complaining of buzzing were being a little too picky. Turns out that isn't the case. First thing I noticed out of the box was a buzzing/clicking when sitting in front of TV (the prime viewing spot). Sitting off to the sides reduced the buzzing slightly, off to the far sides and the buzzing was a non-issue. Brightness, contrast settings seemed to have little to do with this. My wife said I was crazy at first, but she heard it also. Volume has to be turned up to nearly halfway to drown out the noise. It is unnacceptable IMO. I contacted Samsung, and after the customer service agent tried to give me the run-around, I told him that I only had this TV one week; his tone quickly changed. He said that the TV was defective and should be returned. I saw through multiple comments here on Amazon and other forums such as AVS that is a widespread problem. Some buyers have returned multiple D8000s trying to get a 'non-defective' TV. It's a shame, because the picture after calibration is amazing. Oh well. I'm not going to go through the hassel of swapping multiple D8000s. Going to swap this for the Panasonic GT30.

This is my fourth large screen, the first two were both 50 \" Pioneers, third was a Sony 60\" Model KF-60XBR800 Grand Wega which I loved and United moving company broke during my move so I was forced to buy another T.V. I researched  for close to two months before I decided on the Samsung, read all test reports and reviews I could find. Out of all the Televisions I have owned I must say this Samsung has the most natural colors, the picture is just about perfect. I do not have any of the problems I read about, no light flicker or problem setting up. I was set up and on the web in about ten minutes. There are a couple on things I do not like, 1 is the sound but you cannot expect much from the tinny speakers that are in this set. 2 and not many people or reviewers mentioned this is the fast and not so fast scenes I can see a ghost, although not bad you do see it and 3, I did find this out till I read the on line manual.  Samsung recommends not to watch a movie that shows the black bars more then 15% a month or you will burn the screen. I have well over 2,000 DVD's and do not know how many Laser disks, I bet at least 80% have black bars on the sides or top. Some can be corrected for by changing the resolution of my Sony player or the picture size of the Samsung but you are sacrificing picture quality or watching your favorite actor gain 4 inches in the waist and 50 pounds. Other then that this is a great set and for picture quality I would recommit this set over the others I reviewed. I would say one thing and that is if you are going to buy this set or any other for the 3D feature, the 3D looks great but check out the movies you like to watch, so far I found the selection sucks.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best HDTV", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "RX9CJO41YYXG2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This HDTV is simply the best.

The unit arrived in perfect condition, and I had it up on a stand in minutes.  After turning it on, I noticed a buzzing noise, but figured it was just the TV warming up.  After checking all surfaces and trying out the remote, the shipping guys got my signature and were gone.  Unfortunately, the buzzing remained.  No matter what I tried, it would not go away.  My couch is about 10ft back from the TV, and the buzzing/droning noise was very annoying.  After a couple days, I called Amazon and asked for a replacement.  Amazon is simply awesome.  Your wish is my command should be their motto.Anyway, the new unit arrived about a week later (Christmas was putting the kibosh on deliveries.  This second unit was similarly in perfect physical condition, but suffered from the same annoying buzzing.  I decided that maybe I could live with it, because the picture is simply phenomenal.  But then I noticed something much more annoying...During the day, I spent a couple hours listening to SACDs on my Oppo.  The Oppo puts up a screen similar to other CD/DVD players, with the corners of the screen holding information like track title, time remaining, etc.  At the center of the screen is s large OPPO in bright white.  You guessed it:  it burned the word OPPO in the screen, and it never came out.  The only time it was noticeable was when the scene turned bright, such as  a sunny sky or snow on a mountain.  You could see the work OPPO in all of its annoying glory right there in the center of the screen.I called Samsung and learned that burn-in was not covered under the warranty, and that I shouldn't watch channels with tickers (like any news channel), or any channel that puts it logo on the screen all the time (like all the other channels).  When I asked how to get rid of the burned in image, they said it was permanent.  When I asked how to avoid burn-in in the future, they said to watch full-screen TV.  I pointed out that almost every television station violates their burn-in rules.  No dice.So I returned the second unit as well, and am still on the search for the perfect TV.  For $2400, you would think there would not be so many issues with these TV's.

Upon unpacking the TVs, I found an relatively deep indentation mark on the back side of the TV near the lower end. I filed a complaint with Amazon.com right away, letting them know the problem.I completed the installation, just want to see if the TV still performs and I want to see what the picture quality would look like. I had viewed some music DVD and some TV program in the last couple of days. I like the picture quality 2D, but have not a chance to view any 3D movies yet.However, this morning I went to check the TV again to see how it is built since I was so busy with the Thanksgiving stuff. Upon careful looking at the TV, I found the bottom metal liner at the front TV seemed to be indented because one area of the liner look lower than the rest. Taking a closer look, I found that the metal liner has very large gap from the glass panel. As a matter of fact, approximately 90% of the horizontal liner separated from the glass, and you can push the metal line in and out with significant movement. I think this is a manufacturer's defect whereas the glue is not holding the thin metal liner to the TV glass. I use a flashlight to run along the three remaining liner (two vertical and the top horizontal liner to see if there is similar gap and found they are pretty well glued to the glass panel, except a couple of gaps with a 2-3 inches in length but not wide open as the bottom liner mentioned above.I have seen many reviewers gave praises to the thin and light weight Samsung Plasma's TVs such as this D8000-series. But some reviewers also expressed reservations about the built quality of these Samsung's TVs, considering the thin materials (such as these metal liners) are used. And apparently, these doubters are correct about the built quality on these TVs.I would like all who own the 64-inch TV to examine these metal liners around your TVs to see if there is a similar gaps. Like I mentioned, unless you run observe very carefully then it is difficult to discover this defect. The thing that worries me the most is that these metal liner will peel off all together, and especially with the gap at the lower edge of the TV, the dust will fall and fill these gaps with dust in no time (as you know the front panel of the TVs attract lots of dusts due to its static magnetic property.)Please response to this link if you find out similar issue! I have talked to Amazon's customer service to see if they have heard similar defects but the rep. I talked to said it was the first time he ever heard about it.Now, I am wondering if I should get a replacement TV. I like the TV's design, the light weight, and picture quality but so concerned about the long-term durability of this TV. Even if I receive a new TV with no gaps between the metal liner and the glass, what would guarantee that similar gaps will not develop after a few months of use?I am thinking of getting the Panasonic P65GT30, but not sure if the picture quality is on par or close to this Samsung's flagship TV. Also, the Panasonic is so much heaviver (but of course more rigidly built,) and their 3D glasses are so outrageously expensive.What do you think, dear fellow TV viewers?", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Two defective sets", "Author": "Dr Gonzo", "ReviewID": "RX7HUORTOZPUA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received two defective sets out of two.

I couldn't wait to hook up my new plasma tv.  Delivery time was good and product was delivered with no damgage. After hooking it up ........I was very disappointed.  The settings out of the box were horrible. After over 300 hours of break in time I decided to surf the net and find out the best calibration settings for this model.  After experimenting with several calibration settings that were posted to be the best settings for this tv I found that they did improve overall picture quality but were still far from great.  Standard tv quality is poor before and just ok after calibration. High Def quality was just ok before calibration and after calibration it was good but not great! 3D quality was pretty good. Sound quality is below average.Also, Samsung had a promotion that should of included two pair of free glasses with the tv thru the seller or a voucher to receive the glasses thru Samsung's website. After receiving the tv I did not receive the glasses or the voucher. During the order process I was under the belief I would receive the glasses  but somehow thru the whole process I was 2 days late on purchasing the tv to get the glasses.  I contacted Samsung and explain what happened and they told me it shouldn't be a problem to just contact the seller because they don't carry any 3D glasses because they all go to their dealers. I then contacted Amazon which I order the tv thru their website and they told me that I would have to contact Electronic Expo which is their affiliate that the tv would be shipped from. I then contacted Electronic Expo and they said they couldn't help me that it was a Amazon only promotion.  I then told them it was an offer Samsung made thru any of their authorized dealers and not an Amazon only promotion and since they was a dealer they should be able to help me.  They told me they couldn't help to call Samsung and they should be able to help me.  After contacting Samsung they told me go to their website and feel out the 3D glasses rebate form and they would take care of it and if there was a problem to contact them.  After filling out the form online ........I checked the status and they refused it so I called them back and they told me sorry we can't help you to call the seller. I then filed a claim thru Amazon and they refused to help me too.  All I got was a run around from Samsung to Amazon to Elect Expo to Samsung back Elect Expo and finally back to Amazon and in the end NO GLASSES.

I have had nothing but problems with the TV and Samsung has tried to get out of doing anything to help.First, the TVs picture is terrible. I have DirecTV HD service and my 7-year-old Panasonic 1080i plasma TV has such a superior picture to this Samsung plasma TV, it isn't funny. When the Samsung TV is powered up, in the upper left corner of the TV screen, a box shows the quality of the picture being displayed on the screen. Mind you, this is supposed to be a 1080p HDTV, but the numbers I have received in the upper left corner have been 1920 x 1080/60i or 1920 x 1080/60p. I contacted Samsung about this asking for an explanation and the reading was blamed on the cables I was using. I purchased new cables built specifically for a 600Hz TV when I purchased this TV and after chatting online with the Samsung rep, I replaced the cables thinking the cables were bad. The cables were fine. Replacing the cables did nothing to the picture quality or the numbers displayed in the upper left corner of the TV screen.Two weeks ago, the QWERTY remote control that comes with the TV starting to work on and off. Within the last couple of days the remote quit working altogether. I have a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone and downloaded the Samsung TV remote app to my phone so I am still able to use the TV. I just got done chatting online with a Samsung rep and the rep had me remove the batteries to reset the remote. That did nothing. The batteries have been replaced twice just in case there was a problem with the batteries. No change. Then the rep wanted me to reset the Bluetooth link between the remote and the TV. The rep sent me a link to their website with instructions for resetting the Bluetooth on the remote and the TV. Well, resetting the Bluetooth on the remote and TV requires a remote that works. My remote DOES NOT WORK! The rep suggested I use the instructions shown in the link, twice, and then said he could give me a link to purchase a new QWERTY remote (the remote sells for $99.00 on Amazon.com; do a search on Amazon to see the poor reviews of this QWERTY remote control). I have owned this TV for less than 3 months and everything is under warranty for one year. I registered my TV with Samsung on their website when I received the TV and it shows both TV and service is covered for one year. Samsung customer service leaves a lot to be desired!I had to ask to speak to a manager before the rep finally agreed to replace the remote.I have also sent an email to Paul's TV, via the Amazon website, and I have yet to hear from them. (I purchased this TV via Amazon.com, but Paul's TV was the seller of the TV and not Amazon.com).If you order from Amazon, be sure you are purchasing from Amazon itself and not a secondary provider selling though Amazon.com. Also, for something as large as a TV, buy locally; don't buy something this large via mail order. You will get much better customer service from a local retailer than you will trying to get help from a retailer thousands of miles away. Once the retailer has your money, that's all they care about.If you are looking for a new HDTV, stay away from Samsung! The quality of the Samsung TV is just not there! I should have purchased a Panasonic 3D-HDTV plasma TV as a replacement TV rather than the Samsung. I had absolutely NO problems in all the years of owning my Panasonic HDTV. My Panasonic TV still works perfectly, but I wanted a larger screen and 3D capability. The Panasonic screen is 42\" and the Samsung screen is 51\".As I said before, I do have a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone and the phone is awesome. Samsung got the phone right, but their TVs leave a lot to be desired - which is mainly quality.I have learned a very expensive lesson. Please learn from my mistake.*****************************************************************************NEW Below***************************************************************************Per some comments to this post, I have made some changes and I've increased the star rating of this TV.

Much of this impression may change after about 200-400 hours of use.  I purchased this from Pauls TV in CA fulfilled by Amazon. They did a great job on the delivery and setup (two gentlemen who waited for me to plug it in an test it before they left). I'd highly recommend them to anyone in CA.First let's note some pretty consistent issues:1) Image Retention2) BuzzingAs with any Plasma image retention is apparent after watching only 30 minues of tickers/logos. I watch the morning news in LA and after 30 minutes of the \"traffic\" bar in the bottom left and the CBS or NBC or KTLA logos on the screen the image retention is evident. I run the white bars from the burn protection menu for 2-5 minutes before I leave and that cures it. So far nothing permanent but I don't watch CNN or other similar programs >1 hour per day.  Plesae note I am using the \"orbiter\" feature and my screen size is usually on 16:9 permitting same.I live in a pretty noisy area - near a freeway and the din is there 24 hours a day.  There is panel buzzing and it's not minimal by any means but not unusual for a plasma. It's not an LCD and not perfectly quiet.The buzz level is not obnoxious but it's present and worse when changing channels using the built in tuner (which is pretty good by the way). For those looking for a quiet set look elsewhere. The buzzing is about 2x (or 3db higher) than my well broken in 2008 Pioneer Kuro which is hardly ever noted. I watch about 6-7 feet away and the TV is directly against a wood panneled wall on an open glass table stand.In my short usage time (with OTA and Blu-ray, Apple TV also) the greatest praise I can leap on it is the color and depth. The contrast ratio is amazing (not perfect but a solid A) and the pre-calibration colors are quite good.I will edit the review once I have 200 hours on it and it's professionally calibrated.One other note - I have the Samsung 6700 3D blu-ray player. Using CEC (HDMI Link) they rarely communicate properly and it's a constant struggle to get the TV to recognize the player. After about 4 attempts - tv on first, BD player on first - they finally recognize each other. I am going to bring another player to the set to see if it's the set or this particular player.

There are some shortcomings, but they are not serious enough to declare a full negative point of rating.  I would honestly say those shortcomings are only a .25 in importance to me.  They are listed: 1.  The TV does makes a slight buzzing sound.  But with a lot of technology, there is always that one non-perfect thing.  This sound is only heard if you sit dead center of the TV and it is not that noticeable to the standard ear.  2.  The key board on the remote is cumbersome.  Not saying it is not functional, but I am saying that it is cumbersome.  I have big hands and that might be a factor, being that the remote is such a small item in relation.  It would be nice if you could dedicate a standard keyboard or mouse to this HDTV.  That would solve a lot of that issue, but then you would have to call it a computer.These are the major plus factors of the HDTV.  !.  The picture is amazing.

The visual aesthetics of the TV itself is as modern as you would wish it to be and very decor adaptable.  It seems to take on the color of the black stand that I have mine sitting on.  The TV frame and stand actually looks black.  I guess you would call it a reflective set.  4. The 3D experience is excellent. I am not a big 3 D fan, but it does works on this TV to perfection.  You  will be quite pleased if you love 3D. 5.  The Netflix app is the best I have ever seen incorporated into any component to date.

I even chatted with Samsung on-line support, but they acted as if they never heard of this before, and suggested that I tweak the tint from red to green - what a geniuos idea, except that it doesn't make things whiter!Needless to say I didn't buy it and opted for Samsung LED, which next to it looked awesome!", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "samsung is crap", "Author": "curt", "ReviewID": "R1D8RF9X872O5N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it does not work as advertised. spent several hours with customer service to find out samsung tv's dont support usb they just advertise that they do. the 3d is terrible also", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "best pic", "Author": "dannyV", "ReviewID": "RPE1GSOMZCGLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "best pic iv ever seen on a TV plus theres no glare . all inter4net stuff works perfect . set up is simple colors are amazing.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "BUYER BEWARE ! ! ! ! 4th ATTEMPT - DEAD ON ARRIVAL - DESIGN ISSUES!", "Author": "Phil H \"Slycow\"", "ReviewID": "R23I9U0JT7TGLT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "9 March 2012 UPDATE:This is the FOURTH ATTEMPTED delivery of this very same 64\" Samsung Plasma TV by Paul'sTV, BUT Fulfilled by Amazon. The prior three times were delivery carrier issues; the third, whereby the Carrier selected by Amazon FLAT LIED ABOUT MY REJECTION OF DELIVERY! The Carrier HomeDirect USA wanted to deliver the TV on FEB 23, when Amazon had verally committed to deliver the 24th, WHICH I HAD BLOCKED OUT. FedeliTone Logistics told Amazon that I had refuse delivery [which they never attempted], WHEN I HAD MERELY TOLD THE CARRIER THAT I HAD A PRIOR APPOINTMENT FOR 23 FEB. Their Dispatcher told me the next delivery to PA was March 6th, to which I agreed. This carrier only services small towns EVERY TWO WEEKS - SO YOUR AMAZON PRIME MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!This Fourth delivery was absolutely going perfectly by Express North America, as verbally committed by AMAZON. BUT, when the carton box cover was removed, and the styrofoam sheet covering the screen, the SCREEN WAS DAMAGED IN AT LEAST SIX DIFFERENT AREAS!SAMSUNG PLASMA TVs, which are wonderful, have A SERIOUS DESIGN DEFICIENCY WHEREBY THE SCREEN IS EASILY DAMAGED; THEREBY DESTROYING THE TV. My prior review noting this could also occur when any child ages 1 - 20 could easily break it, RESULTED IN RESPONSES THAT INDEED THIS HAS OCCURRED!IT APPEARS THAT THIS MODEL DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL STANDARD OF IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY; THERE RAISING SERIOUS LEGAL ISSUES FOR SAMSUNG! ! ! ! ! and possibly AMAZON, TOO!FIRST TIME TO REVIEW:Several events occurred yesterday prompting me to write this. Normally I would contact you via Amazon's site, but this order has been removed; and the current order # 8454621 for exactly the same Samsung 64\" Plasma TV has yet to ship.I bought my previous 58\" Samsung Plasma TV from Amazon May 2011, but I killed it by accident, causing me to replace it. The delivery and service I received last May was consistent with all other thousands of transactions that I have made through Amazon. I admit to being addicted - Amazon just makes it TOO easy for me and all others!Delivery last May was exemplary. I believe it was made by Home Direct; but not positive. Yesterday's delivery was scheduled through Home Direct, but sub-contracted to Fedelitone Logistics (425) 207-0369. Their Delivery Serivce was HORRIBLE: rude; crude; inconsiderate of my furniture & personal property; with their only concern of spending as little time in my apartment as possible. It was almost as if someone were outside with a stop watch timing them.Once they entered my apartment, they were efficient at doing as little as possible: 1) cut the straps; 2) removed the top portion of the box; 3) removed the wrapping from the TV screen; 4) located the remote controller; 5) Partially lifted the TV unit from the lower protion of the box to plug it in, then turn it on.  The unit would NOT turn off using the same remote controller used to turn it on. Therefore, with Amazon on the line, I REFUSED DELIVERY; then placed another order with Amazon. This order is designated  \"Fulfilled by Amazon\", which I take to mean that you meet or exceed Amazon's level of Customer Service.At this point they were ready to leave, telling me that was all they were required to do. I immediately called Amazon Customer Service to confirm; and was told that MarketPlace Vendors define the delivery & installation instructions to the carrier. They were not aware of Paul's specifically. The delivery personnel yesterday also had total disregard taking care around my furniture or personal property. I DO NOT WANT THEM IN MY APARTMENT EVER AGAIN! You can cancel my current open order, if they are to be used again.Having recently moved from Southern California, I know Paul's is the largest seller of TVs in that market. Having moved to the Seattle area last April, I have seen your advertisements on local stations. A company the size of yours does not grow, or have repeat customers with such shoddy delivery service. I know that you use your own trucks in SoCal, but have no idea about delivery service in you other market areas.I do NOT hold Amazon; or Paul's responsible. I do hold Home Direct indirectly responsible, since they selected Fidelitone Logistics. I have no idea who selected Home direct, but they are also indirectly responsible for permitting Home Direct to not control delivery service.I would be most happy to have the delivery service used May 2011 to deliver the order I just placed with you; and with the same level of service. The delivery service personnel were professional; careful while working around my furniture; courteous; and quite helpful in setting it up and showing me how to use the remorte. I was so pleased and amazed, I gave each $20 for exemplary service - it was worth it.NOTE: The Samsung 58 inch was excellent, BUT HAD ONE DESIGN DEFICIENCY! ! ! A mild hit to the screen resulted in the screen totally blank, and NOT REPAIRABLE, hence this new order. If you have children between the ages of 1 - 20; a clumsy person like me; or even pets;  YOU ARE AT HIGH RISK, AND NO WARRANTY OR INSURANCE COVERS THESE EVENTS. For less than $50 Samsung could solve this with a clear high-tech polymer like that in the lens of my prescriptive variable range hi-index; hi-impact lens. Otherwise, Samsung makes the finest TVs available.If I could give Paul's delivery to me a ZERO, I would. However, this is NOT made by Paul's fleet of delivery trucks for major metrolpolitan areas. Delivery was also delayed more than a week by this 5th rate carrier, UNTIL THEY COULD FILL THEIR TRUCK FOR THIS AREA OF WASHINGTON. This, in spite of being promised Amazon Prime Service. Even Amazon is emnbarrassed by this incident which has NEVER occurred on the previous thousand of items I have purchased here. BUT MY EXPERIENCE COULD HAPPEN TO YOU, unlike the experience I had May 2011 when my Samsung 58inch Plasma TV was delivered.

In fact, even if you are looking for a \"good\" TV stay away.  The set has an amazing picture if it is static, but once the image moves it falls apart.  This is a TV, not an image browser, so it gets 1 star in my opinion.Let me explain my reasoning.  When you have medium to dark scenes that have light areas and the scene moves, you can see large step changes in brightness in the whole picture.  Once you start recognizing this, which could be several days depending on the content you watch, you will see it all the time and it is very annoying.  I calibrated the picture and turned off all the usual settings that may cause this including dynamic contrast, eco mode and other artifact causing bells and whistles TV producers usually put in these sets and it still happens.  I put my 5 year old Panasonic plasma next to it with the same source and it does not do it, so I couldn't blame the source.  Next I called Samsung support.  They went through the picture menu to tell me to turn off all the settings I already had and decided to send out a technician to evaluate it.  I told the technician the issue and he saw it right away.  He said that he thinks that all the new Samsungs do it, but he would replace the board just in case.  As you can guess, even with replacing the board, it had the same problem.So, after spending the extra money to get the top of the line Samsung plasma, I am returning it because it is not as good as my 5 year old Panasonic.

How can I help you today?Scott : Hi SandraSandra: Please go ahead.Scott : I had my PN58C8000 replaced with a PN59D8000 due to several failures of my first TV.

My Samsung product that was still under warranty failed twice. Samsung decided to replace the TV with a newer model. I should not be penalized for a faulty Samsung product that was under warranty.

You need to purchase the glasses seperatley.Sandra: It has been a while since I've received a message from you. Are we still connected?Scott : I know Samsung has replaced old glasses for other customers that have had this same problem. There are MANY!!!! Just search the forums. Samsung on many occasions issues vouchers to replace the glasses as a good faith gesture that they stand behind there products and for the inconvenience of having to go through constant TV failures due to know issues with the 2010 sets.Sandra: Would you mind holding a few minutes while I gather the required information for your request?Scott : No Problem, Thanks!!Sandra: You're welcome.Sandra: Thank you for holding.Sandra: I've checked your transaction ticket and see that the TV was replaced.
