I purchased the Toshiba TV over LG and others for two reasons, price and the built-in CEVO chip.  It has a built-in game mode, but I have found that it doesn't really matter because the TV responds very well in all modes.As for an Amazon review, I had to return the TV because it had a bright light in the upper corner.  It was not Amazon's fault.  Toshiba reported that the TV is defective.  I have not received a refund from Amazon, but I do not have any doubts because Amazon is amazing!  I purchased another exact unit, and I am very happy.  Details follow.PROs*Cheaper than all other 3d TV models in the 42\" class (as of 12/2011)*3d TV with 4 pairs of glasses*240Hz with the ability to turn off*Smart TV with both, wired and wireless, apps built-in*The TV is really 42\" diagonally, most other TVs in the class are 41.x*Color is beautiful, better than the other brand models in my opinion*Games are amazing with or without 240Hz turned on*2d to 3d conversion is not amazing, but works well on HD content*Includes adapter cables for component and RCA connections*Ports...so many ports on the TV*Great sound output to sound system (it has so many ports that I decided to use the 1/4 mini-plug for audio)CONs*TV takes about 15 - 20 seconds to turn on from a cold start, warm start is only about 5 seconds (my older Samsung TV took 10 seconds, so this is not a big deal for me)*For the best 3d quality, you need to be eye level (if TV is mounted on a wall above eye level, it may be a problem)*No HDMI cables included in the box", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great 3D, Reasonably Priced Glasses", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Sharkey\"", "ReviewID": "R105MXTSUIXN6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The real question for me was passive 3D quality. The result is similar to shutter glasses. If there is reduced video quality I can't see it. The polarized glasses included with the set (4 pairs) are of good quality. I purchased several pairs of used Real D glasses online and they feel a little sturdier(paid $.90 per pair delivered). The other basics: 1080p as good as any TV I've seen, good 480i picture, basic(but passable) TV sound, easy setup and a nice backlit remote. Wireless access to some web content, One button to access netflix. Easy access to youtube and a few other video services. Widget availability is almost laughable. Can't find true access to the web. 2D to 3D conversion is interesting. Not really 3D, but adds a little something to baseball. I was a little worried about the size (in 3d size does matter), but the 3D is good quality from approx 5 to 12 feet.

I was afraid this wouldnt have an 'in your face' 3d effect I saw from an LG in bestbuy. But after playing the same LG 3d demo, I am impressed. Ive been using the tv for 3 days now, 3d and 2d is great. Some cons - it takes about 15 seconds to turn on, and sound is not too good. 3d effect on this tv is much better than in the theaters.

Huynh", "ReviewID": "R2SX2G9GX86RCT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Full disclosure, I originally ordered it from Amazon but at the time it said 1-3 months for shipment.  I didn't really feel like waiting that long so I canceled the order and got it online from the big chain brick and mortar store.General SetupWell, after getting the tv, I proceeded to set it up.  The base is sturdy, heavy and the top part made of glass.  Assembling the two parts of the base of the tv with the screws took only a few minutes.  Just an fyi, you will need a regular size phillips screw driver since one is not included with this tv.  Once assembled, I plugged the power cord in and turned it on.  From the time you hit the power button to the time an actual image appears on the screen is approximately 20 seconds.  Only a series of blinking green lights on the front in those 20 seconds lets you know that you actually powered it on.  On a side note, the touch sensitive buttons on front are really nice.Once on, it assists you through the basic setup with proper time zone, etc.  After that, I proceeded to set up the tv.  The options were either by antenna or cable.  Since I have cable, I went that route.  Next, I went to set up the internet.  From the wireless option, I chose assisted set up.  Once it found the wireless network, it asked to enter the passkey on my router.  After entering the passkey, make sure you hit the blue button on the remote right below the word 'HOME'.  That confirms the setup.  When I first did it, after entering the passkey, I hit the return key (thinking that was what I had to do) then hit done.  If you do that, it will not work.  Learn from my mistake.ThoughtsI really wanted to love this tv but after getting it, I found it to be average or just slightly above average compared to my other tv in my home which is a Vizio E3D420VX.  I got this tv to be my one all - for my ps3, tv, and pc monitor.  Connected to the ps3, it looks good and games play flawless without lag.  As a tv, in my opinion, it falls short of the Vizio in sharpness and clarity.  Don't get me  wrong, it's nice, if I didn't have anything to compare it to, but it's about average or slightly above average as a hdtv.As a pc monitor, it falls quite short.  For some strange reason when it's used as a pc monitor the screen is blurry.  Just an fyi, I have it connected via a vga cable.  I know it was not my computer because I've used it to connect to my Vizio and another tv that I have (which is a Samsung 2333HD) both displayed a perfect resolution of 1920x1080 before.  Since I couldn't figure it out, I called Toshiba's Support Number - 1-800-631-3811.  After being on hold for about 10 minutes, I finally got through to a call center.  The person on the other line spoke English but had a hard Indian accent, you can just guess where the call came from.Anyways, after telling him my serial number for the tv, I described my situation to him.  I told him the screen was blurry when it was connected to the pc.  He then advised me to go into the Properities and lower the resolution to make it clearer.  I tried to inform him the reason why I got a 1920x1080 tv was so I could take advantage of the screen space.  He said he understood but you have to reduce the resolution in order for the picture to be clear.  Clearly, it didn't go well, and I hung up.  I did do as he suggested and the screen did become clearer once I reduce the resolution.  The problem was I had less space and all the icons were huge.  I went back to the original setting - 1920x 1080 and turned off my pc and went back to tv mode.The other reason I was excited about this tv was the 2D to 3D conversion.  I love 3D and the idea that I could have an endless supply of 3D content was exciting.  But after trying it out, I was quite disappointed.  The 2D to the 3D conversion is more of a gimmick than anything else.  I've tried it with a ton of stuff but was only able to achieve a tiny bit of depth with it.  I should have listen to everybody else, my fault.  Well, I then tried it with an actual 3D blu ray movie that I had - Under the Sea. Since the movie was actually filmed in 3D, the 3D looked quite good.  There were several incidents where there were out of screen (oos) effects.  So in short, if it's not filmed in 3D, the content doesn't seem to work or at the very most has a little depth.The apps that I have tinkered with since getting this tv include Netflix, Pandora and Youtube.  Netflix seem to work flawlessly.  But my personal best experience with Netflix has been on my PS3.  Why?  It loads much faster, better clarity overall and I find searching with the PS3 controller much easier than with the tv remote.  Pandora is great.  I like to turn it on when I'm cleaning.Youtube is a below average experience.  Once loaded, you basically have two options - do a search or browse.  Well, I did a search with it to see how it would look.  After you do a search, you get a list of videos that scroll horizontal at the bottom of the screen.  The interface is quite crude and has a way to go before it could be deemed good.  The last feature that I found quite nice are the usb ports.  It's cool that you can play photos, music and videos via the usb slots.  I don't know all the various video files that are playable but I can confirm mkv and mp4 files are playable on the Toshiba.  I like this because on my Vizio, it can only recognize music and photo files via the usb slot.In short, the tv is nice but has fallen short of my overall expectation.  I am going to return it and look for something else.Update: 1/24/2012- mov and avi files are not playable through the USB port- haven't returned it yet, really want to test out the pc with a working dvi to hdmi cable.  I will order another one on amazon and see if it works.Update: 2/10/2012- purchased another dvi to hdmi cable to test my pc, was unable to get a signal.  it is possible i might have a bad dvi port on my pc.  will be returning the tv to the store.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exceptional experience", "Author": "consumer907", "ReviewID": "R1F659NH4ATGSL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This being my first Full HDTV that I personally purchased, I was absolutely blown away by the picture quality compared to the 55\" LCD Samsung HDTV that my parents own.

The 3D experience is great and the 2D to 3D conversion is also very good but there is a clear difference which is to be expected.  The NetTV apps also works great.

Have been running tests left and right to see if it is worth having one. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:-I was impressed by how slim the led tv is 1.3\".-The 2d to 3d conversion works very well, comparable to major brands such as Sony, Samsung but at 1/2 the cost. Can't beat that.-The actual 3d works very well, i ran 3d demos off from youtube (not using the smart tv app but downloaded 1080p 3d demo mp4s and have it played on my ps3) boy was i impressed. The 3d effect is pretty much like that from the theater. Some good demos from youtube are samsung 3d demo, panasonic 3d demo, SNDN genie 3d demo, etc.-the 240hz refresh rate really makes a difference, i was playing LOTR blu-ray on my ps3 and the motion was endless smooth, it was like too smooth that the motion have no pause it is definitely a big PLUS.-2 USB ports to plug in your external HDDs to view media.Cons:-Both picture and colors were not as good as my old Samsung but at 1/2 the price for a 3D tv, nothing can beat this.-Speakers are surround but quality is not extremely well. External speaker is optional for this tv but recommended for theatre effects.-Navigating thru the TV Smartapp is like doing surgery with the remote. Especially trying to do a search on youtube. Why isn't there a user account option where i can view my youtube subscriptions or favorite videos? This app is so dumb.-Not much user preferences option for the Smartapps. The Smartapp is not really that smart.-No QWERTY keyboard option, because it is required to having to type in searches for the Smart\"Dumb\"Apps. Why offer the facebook app option when typing in your username and password with a remote is like being a surgeon? Toshiba you never thought of this scenario?-I have a VGA cable running PC-TV and my PC wasn't able to detect the TV as 1920x1080P my old Samsung could. It was running at some weird lower resolution so the screen is not full on TV. It can be made full from TV by switching the Pic Size to fit/full but the effect is detectable because the Pic is stretched not actual 1080P quality. Why wasn't I am to do 120hz (like the other reviewer said) from PC-TV via VGA, unless i am doing something wrong.-TV takes 15seconds to turn on.-Switching between 2d-3d always have warning message that don't go away unless pressed ok, its annoying.Other thoughts:-it will be nice if i can hook up my bluetooth keyboard via Bluetooth to the tv. Or have an Iphone/Ipad App that can use a smartphone as a remote or keyboard. My old samsung was able to do this, that's why a Samsung is still a Samsung \"leader in innovative tv technology.\"", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good price but with some bad feature", "Author": "common usser", "ReviewID": "R2G1HESFGCQ0GS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV around March of 2012 and I wait until now to do a reviews on this product because I want to get to know everything about this TV Before I made any statement on this TV.Pro.The Picture is Clear as it can be especially when you are in Sport Mode.Low electricity consumption3D at lower priceit have wireless internet build in and no need for a adapter stick in the side.light up remote-controlit connect and play all your movie and mp3 on your networkMultiple connection from USB to Ethernet portIt have social network build in like Facebook es...it also allow you to use Skype but you need a webcam for it.Con.The TV is very slow to respond when turn on. it took about 30sec - 1 min. to turn on the TV.there is no keyboard to the remote so it take some time search or navigate around on Youtube.Although it said 240HZ but the pixels still show up went they do a close up of a player on the move.The sound is terrible but you can get a sound bars for itIt connect to the internet but you only can go to some internet site like YouTube, Netflix, yahoo app, but it did not let you search allover the net like Google or Firefox", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "good value, good set of features", "Author": "pdxtodd", "ReviewID": "R3PN9VU6D8FWIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So we've had this TV for about 2 weeks now.  Wanted to give it some time to make sure everything was figured out and working before writing any kind of review.Pros:  good picture, sound is fine (unless you really crank it loud).  Very thin unit - love the depth (1.3 inches) - great for wall mounting, which we did.  Love the passive 3d.  I highly recommend passive 3d if you're getting this TV for kids - no use buying an Active 3d TV and buying expensive 3d glasses when they are going to step on them or lose them anyway.  the Passive 3d is just fine, and the 2d to 3d conversion is enjoyable, but I doubt we'll use it much.I have (after a bit of research and effort) been able to read video files of most any type from my home Media server, and been able to play them through the built in wi-fi in the TV.  I read others were unable to get MKV files to play this way, but I did figure out a way to do it using TVersity Media server (free download), and selecting the 'always transcode' option under the transcoding options on the TVersity media server software.  Works really well.  Have had some stuttering with some 3D videos that I'm trying to read this way - I suspect that may be a PC issue with the media server, not an issue with the TV (maybe not enough CPU or video oommph - not sure just yet.)2D picture is very good - a bit blue tinged, but not bad.  Black levels appear to be good.  Love the remote!my kids use this primarily for their Xbox.  Have noticed NO game lag -even when not on game mode.

The screen size (42') is in truth much larger than it sounds.  The behavior of the TV is perfect - it's 3D conversion works just as it should, although it should be said that certain things just shouldn't be in 3D because of their low motion and how they were show (like Pawn Stars or the news).  The color and image quality allows for amazing pictures of principle photography, but leaves one with something to be desired any time graphics based special effects are used - they can easily be seen to be artificial; yet this is no fault of the TV, it's showing you the truth of the quality of the information its given.

I consider my tech level above average so take the following review however you like.Cons:- I find the Color not as vivid when compared to other brands.  This is by far my ONLY serious con about this TV.  I tried calibrating every setting but didn't give any substantial effect.Neutrals:- TV start up time is about 15 secs.  I don't really care bc it is not made to race.  Oh no!  You can watch TV 5 secs quicker.  Big deal!- No QWERTY keyboard on remote so internet apps are not as user friendly.  I dont use these features since I stream with my desktop.- Some people report edge bleeding and clouding.  I have very minimal if any for both.- Some people report screen flickering.  I believe this is due to auto brightness sensor and dynalight settings which I have off.- The sound is ok.  Let me remind you that the sound is generated by speakers that are encased in a 1.15\" thick frame.  Do you expect pounding subwoofer sound?Pros:- Passive 3D picture quality does not seem to degrade from 2D.  Maybe just a lil bit darker.  Watched Lion King 3D and DirecTV 3D channels and it displayed multiple levels of depth perception.  Future sports programming in 3D is what I am looking forward to.  Nature shows as well.- 2D to 3D conversion adds a little depth to the picture but definitely no eye popping effects.- 2D picture quality is as clear as any TV that I have watched.  The blacks are very dark.  The picture production is very uniform across screen. (See cons about color)- Sound is definitely OK when you don't want to use your surround sound.  Music and dialogue can be heard clearly but don't expect any bass.- Every feature that any HDTV can have.  Read the amazon description!Updated Review on 2/6/12:Ok, I calibrated the TV with AVCHD.iso burned to DVD from the AVS HD 709 site. Altho i did get a lil better color production, the overall color still isn't as vibrant as I would like so I went out and bought an LG 42LW5300 (Upgraded firmware to version 5.xx) for comparison:3D - LG produced more accurate depth perception when I was watching ESPN 3D. (Supposedly due to firmware?)2D to 3D - LG had more pop.2D - Overall picture quality is similar but LG colors are more vibrant.Sound - LG had better built in speakers. Also, I find some DTS signals did not pass thru the Toshiba from HDMI in and optical out to my receiver. Had to switch from bitstream to linear PCM for Avatar. However, DTS did pass thru the LG with same set up.Screen - Edge bleeding is more noticeable on the LG. (Mb I can improve it by messing with the panel?).PC Mode - There was very minimal difference in Input lag (on the LG, you have to name the HDMI port \"PC\") but I believe Toshiba is better. Toshiba's Full RGB is 4x4x4 while LG is 4x2x2 but I can hardly tell the difference.Other - LG is not a smart TV, is 120hz, came with a free blu-ray player (which I dont plan on using), and have 1 less HDMI port but these dont affect me since I stream with my PC and I dont watch shows more than 120hz.Conclusion - I am most likely keeping the LG and returning the Toshiba. Haven't tried unlocking the service menu for THX settings but I like my current picture quality anyways.

Beautiful, sharp picture and high refresh rate make it pleasurable to watch it for extended periods of time. The 3D is fabulous and clear. I have enjoyed many a games and movies on this TV in 3D for hours on the end without eye strain.The deal breaker for me if I switch to other brands is the fact that the TOSLINK output on them seem to resample all signals to 48 khz fixed. I tested this out on a wide variety of TVs including Samsung, LG, Sony etc, and they seemed to be doing the same super annoying resampling .Now this is a big deal for me, since i am kind of a picky audiophile and like purity in my signal.This is the *ONLY* TV brand so far that does not resample signals and I can achieve a fabulously uncolored 44.1 khz signal to my high end DAC. The DAC is connected to a bunch of high end studio monitors and this leads to audio/visual bliss.Well done Toshiba.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "great TV", "Author": "Tony The Tiger", "ReviewID": "RS5Q3TYQAMWKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "just don't return it I return the TV and they said that the TV was damaged and they deduct the money for my return when the TV was ship there was no damage on the TV so be careful with that", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "you cant beat the price", "Author": "oscar", "ReviewID": "RESA27WKOURXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought this for my bedroom and have had it for a couple of months now. it beats the old rca dino bubble tube i use to have. didnt have much trouble when that tv was left on. but when this tv is left on because the screen is so large its almost like leaving a light on. now i set the sleep timer which helps out.netflix: does not work well. does not let you browse.....you better find your movie quickly or it disconnects.hdmi connections work well with my computer.but no picture in picture(pip).it does take 40 seconds for a start up, but so what the picture is great, my 55 inch samsung cost 4 times more.so for the price you cant beat it", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "What would you pay for a tv?", "Author": "Travis L.

After switching cable services (from Time Warner Nightmare to AT&T--which; offers great bundle packages that you can customize to your own tastes and not be forced to take unwanted services as TWC makes you do)...I have enjoyed the best picture quality, best reception, and best connection to Netflix, the internet, and HD quality that I have ever seen (even compared to my siblings and parents units from LG, etc.).  Quite happy with the quality, the overall look and feel of the TV, and the ease of use (the remote control is incredibly user-friendly)...big thumbs up to Toshiba and Amazon for offering such a great price on a high quality TV...", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "AMAZING PICTURE AND 3D", "Author": "T-MAN \"Movie Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R142BMHPAD4JK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had tried several other passive 3D tv's before I got this one. The picture quality is terrific! Even out of the box without calibration the picture is superb. Once the set is calibrated the picture is down right amazing(only on high def tv & video). Standard def tv is better than most. The 2D to 3D is okay, it only adds a little depth, you don't get the pop out of the screen effects you get with a video that has been filmed with(native 3D) or converted to with the proper 3D equipment. I dont think this tv can be beat at this price point. The led bleeding problem, which is an issue with all edge lit led tv's , is not as noticeable on this tv. There is a slight bit in the corners, but that is just the nature of edge lighting. In short I think this tv based on picture quality and 3D ability is the best bang for the buck!

Here is what I liked about this TV:1. The 3d picture is GREAT as well as the 2d-3d converted pictures. You feed like you are right there.2. The 2d picture is good however not as great as my sharp which is 4 years old.3. I don't care about all the net features as I use my other devices to achieve those functions. IMO, the TV should just be a TV. I have a Tivo that can play netflix, a revue that can play netflix, my panasonic 3d bluray player that can play netflix, you get the picture.4. The TV prompted my to do a firmware upgrade. It warned me not to touch the TV until the upgrade is finished. I accepted and the progress bar showed for a few seconds then it disappeared. The TV was not responding to commands! I was not sure if that is normal and I was scared to turn it off as it may damage the TV. So I gave it 15 minutes then I pulled the power cord off. When I put it back on, it took like a minute to restart and it looked like the firmware was not changed. So I restarted the process and this time it finished and it restarted by itself but the firmware version was still not changed. The third time was the charm and the firmware was upgraded. This is a tad bit scary. Imagine if it happens 2 years down the road when the TV is out of warranty. I think the firmware upgrades should only be when absolutely necessary.5. The warning message when you display 3d pictures is quite annoying.6. Sound is okay. Not too horrible as other reviews have mentioned but okay for a bedroom.7. The TV itself looks nice and would fit with any decor. I like the clean lines and the hidden speakers. The finish is dark hairline black. Not so gray as the pictures might show.8. The price is great and I think it is worth paying the extra money to get the 3d features.9.

The same thing for component cables so that means you have to buy another set of rca or component cables & hook it on to the TV. If you use HDMI or usb or optical output for audio then no problems.
