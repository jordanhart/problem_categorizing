Not any good for Wii or PS3, the wireless does break up once i a while, but there is no cable mess at all. I will return this TV and get another with long HDMI cables.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Shame on Samsung!", "Author": "E. Campbell", "ReviewID": "R1KAJQAPPFZN15", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Shame on them for not plastering across the box of this unit in big red letters \"CANNOT BE USED FOR ANYTHING BUT TV AND DVD!!!!!\"  The delay between the wireless box and the screen makes playing video games impossible and using the set with a computer in a business environment for things like powerpoint presentations a major annoyance.  Why even release the thing until you have sufficient technology to fix this problem?  We aren't THAT desperate for a wireless plasma!  These days, even an elderly couple who would never in a million years consider playing a video game on their TV needs to take this into consideration because their grandkids will likely be coming over for the weekenend with their Nintendo Wii.  What if they don't find out until a year or so after they purchase it?  What a bummer!  Like I said, shame on Samsung.  This set will really be a letdown to a lot of people at some point during their ownership.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "DO NOT USE FOR VIDEO GAMES!", "Author": "JW", "ReviewID": "R2BUAZDIN3KEE9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The wireless system creates a delay that makes this TV unsuitable for use with video games.  I have both a Nintendo Wii and a computer hooked up to the TV.  With both, there is a noticeable and significant onscreen delay.  If you simply want to watch television, this product is fine.  However, if you want to use it for games, select another TV, you will be disappointed with this one.", "Date": "July 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "future paper weight", "Author": "overwhelmed but not stupid", "ReviewID": "R2Z3KVB9NGEIU4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As stated by someone previously, this easily can become a paper weight. Once the transmitter box goes there is no option for making use of the excellent quality TV. Samsung saved a couple of dollars by not including any physical inputs. Even a 75 ohm connector could help. After less then two years our box is done. And, again as stated previously, the techs do not even know about the wireless until they can look it up. Discontinued as Samsung obviously released a product that was not ready.Jerry", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "If the wireless receiver breaks, you've got a big paperweight", "Author": "Freeplanet", "ReviewID": "RPOSDS9PQQ9QO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "BEWARE!  I bought this HDTV 18 months ago. About 10 days ago, the wireless receiver began to malfunction and then stopped working altogether. It wont power up and without the receiver sending a signal to the TV, its just a beautiful shiny black box that cant even be used as an independent monitor.I wrongly assumed that a company that prides itself in selling the best quality TVs on the market would stand behind their product, since nobody buys a $3,500 TV if its only going to last a year,  Yet Samsung only provides a 1 year warranty.  I wouldnt mind paying for service but here's the catch: Samsung has discontinued the model and doesn't stock the part! And seeing how its only a one 1 yr warranty, they disclaim responsibility.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsumg Wireless TV 5894W", "Author": "T.

Even worse, Samsung techs do not understand that the TV comes with a seperate wireless media controller thus will not replace the unit. Samsung has dispatched two techs to my house and both say the wireless media is dead and needs to be replaced. Samsumg will not replace the unit becasue the TV STILL HAS A PICTURE. The most rediculous thing i have ever heard. I have nine flat screen TV's throughout my house and will never buy another Samsumg. Other Samsung TV are ok however Samsungs tech support is so bad they don't even know there own model TV's.Stay away from any wireless TV's.

Unfortunately, last week, Hurricane Irene caused rampant power outages that damaged the wireless AV's power supply so that it wouldn't turn on.We were daunted reading other reviewers comments here about Samsung's service: their lack of knowledge about this specific set, and unavailability of parts since the TV is discontinued. We were fearful that it couldn't be repaired or that it would cost so much we would have to opt to replace it.On the contrary, our service experience was excellent.  Samsung promptly referred to \"Home Service Network Inc.\", their authorized service center in New Jersey.  An experienced technician, Jon J., was quickly sent to our home.It was clear that Jon was a skilled technician and knowledgeable in all Samsung products, including this unique wireless model.  Jon reassured us that the set would be working fine. He quickly diagnosed the problem, gave us an estimate, and replaced the damaged power supply parts on the spot.We must compliment Jon for his friendly and courteous manner and his high level of expertise, and Home Service Network for quickly responding to the service call.The quality of the picture on this beautiful set is exceptional and rivals any new HDTV, 3D or otherwise, so we are very happy that it was restored.  Don't be discouraged by the other reviews. If you should ever have a problem with your home theater electronics, just ask for Home Service Network and Jon.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wish We Had Not Wasted The Cash", "Author": "Janet A.

Will not make that mistake again.Looks great but if I wanted to drop 3k on a wall hanging I would have dropped into Park West and bought a painting.After five service calls and three sets of speakers, we will never purchase Samsung again.As in all the other reviews ,slow ,time lag on sound,useless for much else besides tv and then only if not much action.Speakers blow and tech says a known problem.As to the guy who says should have known better about games, two of the adverts we saw for this system showed it as a gaming system.AND last but not least they stopped production, what does that tell you?Beware", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "ULTIMATE HD/BLU-RAY EXPERIENCE!!!", "Author": "Everett A.
