One was perfect. The other had a grey oval on the screen whenever displaying something dark on the TV. I think there are some quality control issues with Sharp recently --- in the past Sharp made excellent television. The main reason that I am writing this review is to talk about the sound quality. I bought this for a bedroom in a vacation home, and I really wasn't expecting anything particularly wonderful, but I did expect it to produce sound adequate to be able to listen to ordinary tv. The audio quality is pretty bad. It has two 10w speakers that point down/back. My first Sharp TV was only 26\" and had forward facing speakers --- it still works and produces amazing sound. During the last decade, Sharp has stopped providing superior audio and has replaced it with not just sub-standard but unacceptable quality audio. I returned the TV with the grey oval, but kept the other for a guest room that is only occupied approximately 15 days a year. After reading Consumers Reports, I bought the LG 32LN5300 32-Inch LED-lit 1080p television set, and the quality was much better than this sharp at only a few dollars more. B00BB0ZTM2I recommend that you get the LG instead of this Sharp. Not only is the picture quality on the LG better, but the sound is acceptable.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "everything is great for this TV", "Author": "JIAWEI YUAN", "ReviewID": "R28NAXBK5UVB7J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love Sharp all the time, and this TV is great especially for its display.

Great quality for a good value.", "Author": "John M. Panzer", "ReviewID": "R3B18K5PBXA547", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a Sharp customer since I bought my first LCD TV from them back in 2007. I still have that set and it works just as great as this one does. I've bought Sharp twice since then, (this one and a Quattron) and all of them have yet to disappoint me in terms of manufacturing quality, picture quality, and input capabilities.Setting up the TV was extremely easy. The VESA mounting holes use small screws, so if you are mounting it, you'll save time if you have a friend hold it up for you during installation. When you connect it, there are few screens that you have to go through before you're done. Channel scanning is also very fast, much faster than other sets.The audio from the TV is not all that bad either for general viewing. I have installed this one for a relative who is hard of hearing, and she was able to hear the sound well. Even at loud volumes, the sound does not distort at all.The picture quality is also very clear, and even though it is only a 720p set, it was pleasurable to watch. Color is not overly saturated, and the sharpness of the set is amazing.I would recommend this set to a friend, and this is probably the best bang for your buck in this price range. If the opportunity arises in the next year or so, I might look into purchasing another one of these as well.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT PICTURE", "Author": "CECIL ERDLY \"Nerds R Us\"", "ReviewID": "R3VFD93OQ8XPGL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a Sharp TV and a Winegard flat wave antenna. At first the results were disappointing because our old converter box was receiving more channels using an old rabbit ears antenna without amplification. So I decided to try the attic. The cable and satellite companies left quite an array of cables behind, but the first one I tried was the correct cable. Wow, what a difference. According to the antenna web site, I aimed the antenna at 233 degrees (from Lakeland FL), and received about 45 channels. I thought maybe it was just a good day for radio waves, but the signals have been consistent for the past month. Most channels are from the Tampa direction, but a few arrive from Orlando. We are very satisfied and really like NOT paying for cable or satellite.

Precourt", "ReviewID": "RZVFX4KHCBSTL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am pleased with this purchase.  I already own a 60\" Aquos TV that I've had for a couple years and love.  I decided to get a 32\" TV for my home office and after trying a few different models settled on this one.Overall the picture is great, with very good contrast ratio (very deep blacks and bright whites.)  It doesn't have the best viewing angle I've seen, but it's acceptable (you loose a little of the color depth if you sit off-center.)  Also, the backlight uniformity is not perfect and while I wish it was better, it is acceptable for me.I agree with other reviewers that the sound quality from the built-in speakers is not great, but I am using an external sound system so I never use the TV speakers anyway.It seems well made and I've found that Sharp products have been reliable in the past, so this seems like a good choice.I had been a big Samsung fan in the past and had seen a Samsung model that I think may have had a better picture than this one, but I have experienced too many problems with their TVs failing (both my own and many other friends) all due to inferior parts being used, usually causing the power supply boards to fail.  Furthermore, their response to these problems is worse than the problems themselves.Overall, I am very happy with this TV and would definitely recommend it, with the only reservation being the sound if you plan to use the built-in speakers.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "fantastic value ! great picture and color balance!", "Author": "dogonpremise \"dogonpremise\"", "ReviewID": "RP0DQCZ97FOHP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "love this tv, easy to set-up, great picture quality and nice design. would have liked more inputs, but that is whyone pay more i venture to guess.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid low-cost, name brand TV with VGA input", "Author": "TiVoMaster \"TiVoMaster\"", "ReviewID": "R236KY4CU0I9RU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV as a replacement for my grandmother's older flat panel that died.
