It is a 20\" flat screen that is easily installed.  The integrated DirecTV card was easily installed and DirecTV had no problem getting it going when I called to activate the card.The picture quality is good, but not great.  Why?  Because the television is not HD.  It should not be a problem for years since DirecTV is digital, but it would be great if they produced a television that was HD and had an integrated receiver.  All in all, a good deal for the price!", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware!  Better yet, don't buy!", "Author": "RibaMac", "ReviewID": "R216SCUOD3PGGA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this unit approximately one year ago at Best Buy for $568.00.  Due to an extensive remodeling project, the TV was just plugged in and the receiver does not work!  Direct TV will take zero responsibility for this!  Their excuse is that the TV is made by HUMAX and that the receiver isn't made by them either.  My response to them is that their name shoudn't be plastered across the box then!  HUMAX also takes zero responsibility (it has a one year warranty - after one year, you can forget getting anything from them) as this unit is no longer made nor sold in retail stores!  Thank goodness, I was not a cheapskate and bought an extended 4 year warranty - the best $99.00 I ever spent!  This was an expensive unit and to not have the TV work because the receiver doesn't work is pretty frustrating (you CAN attach a different receiver to it and it should work, but that pretty much defeats the purpose and makes for an expensive 20\" LCD TV!)  Installing an integrated receiver obviously wasn't such a hot idea.  I'm not yet sure how Best Buy will handle this, but it is under warranty, so they will need to deal with it somehow.  I guess I would rather buy a different flat screen TV and simply attach a Direct TV receiver to it, so that if one goes down, they don't both go down.  I would think twice before you buy this unit.  It is a nice looking, compact unit, but it's not worth it if something goes wrong. It seems that satelite receivers have a tendency to \"die\" way more often than they should.  My brother is currently on his third one after 4 years!", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "One of the best TV on the market", "Author": "Penny", "ReviewID": "R1MOGI7P9XEMP0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this television for about 4-5years and never, never had any problem with it.  It is easier to place because of no external reciever. It is the right size not to big and not to small, perfect for a kitchen or boat. We keep ours in the kitchen and watch it more than our 65in in the living room.

Receiver for around 6 months now.  I was impressed with the ease of setup, and the ability to get rid of the unsightly sat. receiver box.  My previous setup on my kitchen counter was a mess of wires, and the remote control situation was cumbersome as well.  This TV makes for an elegant solution.Picture quality (while SD) is quite good.  News, football, golf, kids shows... all look great.  I really don't have any complaints at all.I wish someone would offer a similar option for a large HDTV (with integrated DVR).", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Humax LCD w Integrated DIRECTV", "Author": "Steve B.

I have mine setup in a spare bed room connected to a DVD player so it can offer standard ED DTV television broadcasts and movie entertainment.  I found overall picture quality, contrast, and color saturation all better than expected and it works quite well for my needs.  With multiple A/V inputs this becomes a versatile piece of equipment even if you won't build a home theater system around it. Set up is intuitive but like previous reviewer, DIRECTV customer service was challenged with the activation, the first two techs I spoke with were completely unaware that the product was even offered by the sat provider.  At under $400 it's worth considering.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Love it All-in-one", "Author": "S.
