I was worried about the quality, but have to say that I am very happy with it.  I use it as my second TV in the bedroom.  The HD picture is beautiful.  However, to be picky, the backlight is not completely even and the blacks are not as black as most more expensive TV's these days. Then again, for the price I paid, I did not expect Sony or Samsung quality.  PS3 games also look gorgeous on this via HDMI.  The speakers are fairly weak, I had a leftover set of computer speakers which I plugged into this TV and it sounds great now.  If anyone has a region hack for this, I would appreciate it if you could post it.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "very good so far", "Author": "P. C.

Less than a year later, it blew up. Was under warrantee, so they had to pay for it's repair. The digital board was shot among other things. Now less than a year after that, it blew up again. Called Orion assuming that the replacement parts from less than a year ago would also be under the same 1 year warrantee, but was shocked to discover they only put a 90 day warrantee on their replacement parts. So I told the lady very nicely that she could at least pay the $35 to have my set looked at by the repair shop and she wouldn't do it. So I told her they were gonna lose one way or the other. I obviously bought a lemon, and they wouldn't stand behind their product, nor their parts. I told her she could help me out, or with my remaining 30 or 40 years on this planet I would tell everyone I know to NOT BUY ANY ELECTRONICS FROM ORION. I assured her that I would be certain to persuade enough people to not buy their product that they would be worse off than standing behind their product now. She chose this route:DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ORION. IT IS JUNK, and they will NOT stand behind their product.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "TLCD TV/DVD COMBO", "Name": "Sansui HDLCDVD260 26-Inch Widescreen LCD HDTV with Built-In DVD Player", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vVfVDqRxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000T8CJY8"}}
