Rice", "ReviewID": "RUQIWSPW3XG45", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A relative bought this TV to finally replace an old 32-inch tube TV and then kindly bought a second for me (both purchased at another retailer for $399 each). I have owned a 32\" 720p lcd for 4-1/2 years and used with both DVD and blu-ray. This is my first true HD 1080p TV.PROs:- backlit LEDs which give a higher contrast (with darker blacks and brighter whites) than edgelit LEDs- excellent picture on blu-rays and HD TV content- reasonable connectivity (antenna/cable 1x, HDMI 2x, DVI 1x, component video input, PC/HDMI audio input 1x, digital out 1x, analog out 1x)- easy setupCONSs:- a little heavier and thicker than edgelit LED TVs (a natural compromise for an improved picture)- the cable inputs are at the back and face backward meaning the cords will go out toward the wall being hard to change if you use a wall mount (note, you can use an HDMI right angle adapter to make the HDMI cords go down)- the speakers aren't the greatest, but that is common for almost all TVs (note, I plan on eventually hooking this up to a home theater system once I ship it overseas)- no bells and whistles found in more expensive SMART TVs (but this is a lot cheaper in price too and most newer blu-ray players can do Netflix, Vudu, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, etc.)Overall I'd say this is an excellent TV for a small room (8-15 feet viewing distance), as a bedroom TV, or a 2nd TV for the basement.- the stand 'feels' flimsy so I always use two hands to turn the TV (I could do it easily with one hand due to how light the TV is, but I like to use extra caution)", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice ...", "Author": "joe_btfsplk", "ReviewID": "R2KR7HCUD822JW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought not one but TWO of these 40\" TVs last Christmas:  one for my girlfriend and one for me.  Hers died after 3 months; mine died after 5 months.  In both instances on restart the screen would flash TOSHIBA for an instant before going black so it wasn't the screen itself.  Toshiba told her that it was an internal harddrive failure and sent a slightly smaller 39\" TV (39L4300UC) as a replacement, although it was actually 38.5\"; I measured it as it seemed noticeably smaller.  It also wasn't plug-and-play so we're still trying to get it to work.  For my replacement I'm going to insist that they send me a 40\" or larger.

At 9 months picture went out. Contacted Toshiba for repair service. After 8 weeks and no service I  contacted Toshiba.  They would replace it with a 39L 2300U B stock after this one is returned. I repackaged everything Including the REMOTE CONTROL and returned it. When the  B stock (refurbished? tv) arrived It had a damaged base and the covers were not properly assembled. Not shipping damage. The base screws and remote control were not included. I contacted Toshiba again AFTER 40 MINUTES ON THE PHONE I WAS TOLD I WOULD HAVE TO PURCHASE A REMOTE FROM THEIR WEB SITE. After 3 1/2 months and at least 2 hours on the phone I still can't watch TV until I pay them for a remote that has already been paid for.

I connected my Netflix, and in the process of watching a movie, the screen went black. I cut the tv off, and turned it on again. Nothing. I called Amazon and I was told to contact Toshiba. I proceeded to call the company, and the only thing they assisted in was telling me that my tv was from CANADA. Why should I care where it's from, I just want it to work! Currently, I'm waiting on UPS to come get this out of my house. This was such a waste of time and effort.

We have been happy with our older small Toshiba Rezga and expected more from this TV.  In setting it up, we found that the base was poor quality plastic, and even with the metal brackets added, we could not make it support the TV firmly.  The frame wasn't bent, but it looked like it had been torqued somehow.  It leaned forward at the top, it leaned to the side and leaned forward on the right.  In other words, it couldn't stand up straight, like a drunken sailor.  The picture quality was OK, though the settings are basic on this TV.  It was difficult to have consistent skin tones from channel to channel.  Since we weren't going to keep the TV, I didn't spend time fiddling with the settings. I was glad to see that it had analog audio output and I could hook up our old VCR.  I returned it with no problem.  I have since bought from Amazon the Panasonic VIERA TC-L37E5 37-Inch 1080p 60Hz Full HD IPS LED-LCD TV and am very happy with it.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super Bowl, Bedroom", "Author": "Tony Sak \"Tony Sak\"", "ReviewID": "R2ECWKYG2J6LUG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like toshiba TVs.  This is our 2nd LCD (well this one is a LED, LCD).Purchased because we needed a new tv for the bedroom and needed an extra TV for a superbowl party.  With its primary purpose being a bedroom TV, it didn't bother me that it only had 2 hdmi inputs.  Every job has a tool per say, and the other competitive TVs. were more expensive.I thought the picture is excellent right out of the box, same with the color calibration and sound (sound within reason it is a very thin TV).4 stars because the TV i received seems to a slightly bent LCD screen.  Toward the top it looks like someone grabbed the TV from the top bezel with 2 hands, and put in a ribbon effect int he LCD screen itself.  It also could be the LED edge lighting just having 2 very bright LEDs there.  I'm not sure, if the replacement is like that, then i know its a design issue.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst TV Ever!!! Dont buy Toshiba products!", "Author": "JOHN P.

At the start of May, the picture started to go out while the sound was still going. It would run several minutes just fine, then the picture would fail. I was able to re-establish it by unplugging the power cord for several seconds, then restarting.When I called Costco, they connected me with a service that walked me through a couple of attempts to reset the TV. No luck. They arranged for in-home service for us, as the TV was too large to bring in. They told me to await a serviceman who would make an appointment. No one called. I called Toshiba and found they had to order a part that would take up to 10 business days to come. After this time, still no call, so I had to call again. They said the part was back-ordered and would only become available June 9, and be ready to make the appointment approximately June 13 or 14.I give the rating of 2 stars, because the product is good for the price, but the service is LOUSY.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks good, but WAY to few inputs!", "Author": "William E.
