{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very pretty picture, some of the time.", "Author": "Andy Dopieralski", "ReviewID": "RDWWEQHGQGHFD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The UN46B8000 is a very good display if space is an issue. However, it is not exactly what I was expecting. The store display I had seen was in open light and the display was connected to a Samsung BluRay player. This appears to be the key, as the display has some proprietary processing enabled for Samsung players. The 240Hz conversion gave the picture an odd life-like quality and I really liked it for CGI films. I figured that would translate well to games and I was tired of the poor black performance on my Aquos, so I picked up the set. A couple of things - first, even though this is touted as LED technology keep in mind that's only for the backlight. The display tech is still LCD. You're not getting per-pixel illumination. You're getting edge-mounted backlighting supplied by LEDs. Second, the set is very laggy. The video has about a 150ms lag when all of the upscaling is turned off and 'game mode' is enabled to reduce lag. In full processing mode (240Hz, dynamic contrast, etc) the lag is over 500ms. If you don't have a Samsung DVD player(which seems to correct it), this translates to noticable lag in video behind the audio track. Extremely annoying. And half a second makes playing games with any optimizations completely worthless. Lastly, the backlighting is blotchy in pure black situations with low ambient lighting. You don't notice it much in normal store/room lighting, but when you turn out the lights the backlight produces soft 'clouds' of grey shift through a solid black field. There are some hot spots around the edge as well, where a small amount of light bleed occurs.The display has a decent number of inputs, especially considering its size. Four HDMI, a component, and a VGA. The lack of a dedicated DVI was surprising, but the first HDMI port doubles as a DVI with a converter (all ports will work with HDPC compliant DVI outputs, but only the first port can handle a standard DVI-I/DVI-D signal from a non-HDPC source).A word about signal range - this display is very strict when it comes to valid source. A receiver that gave me perfect performance at 1080p with my Aquos produces an invalid signal error with this display. A cheaper HDMI cable I was using for my PS3 produced nothing but static on the screen. I had to go get an official PS3 cable to get a correct 1080p display. My ZuneHD dock will NOT display at 720p, regardless of what I've tried. It works fine on other displays, but the Samsung won't sync the signal. Very frustrating.The extra features of the set may appeal to some, but I have no need for a terribly slow media streming service built into my set. Any dedicated media streaming station or game console is going to outperform the in-set features for DivX playback. The widgets were just a bad idea. I have a 50Mbps internet connection and they still take forever to load. They aren't really useful and 'typing' with the remote is an exercise in self loathing.Aesthetically, the set is incredible. The ultra-thin bezel is a thing of beauty. Glossy in the right places and stylish. You will most likely want to turn off the blue LED on the front of the set though, as it glows so bright it is a major distraction in low light situations. This is easily accomplished through the setup menu.The remote is a mixed bag. Most people buying a set at this price point will probably have a universal anyway, but some may not. Samsung even recognizes that their remote is overly cumbersome and they include a second 'mini' remote for basic volume/channel/source features. The main remote has a motion sensor in it so whenever the slightest vibration occurs (such as a bass-heavy moment in a movie) it lights up. Getting up to get a snack? It lights up. Did your cat rub up against your coffee table? It lights up. The actual controls are pretty standard. There's an iPod style jog wheel for navigating menus, but you'll probably give up the poor performance of the circular motion for standard four point clicking. This leads to misinterpretation of your input sometimes, since the wheel will move slightly when clicking on the four points and the selector on screen will move as a result. I would have perferred a simple arrow interface. Part of the problem may be due to the fact that the menus are very laggy. Most operations on the display seem to be.I can't rate the audio because I don't use the built-in speakers. Given the size of the set, I can't imagine them being very good at anything but high to high-mid range. But I can't say for certain.Final verdict- If space or wow-factor are an issue, then this set certainly fits the bill if you can't set up a high end projector. The blacks are decent and there are plenty of inputs. There are minor issues around the backlighting in low-light environments and it is not the best set for video gaming because of the lag. If you have a Samsung BluRay player you will get the most benefit out of this display. Other players will display noticable lag when some of the 'wow' features are turned on. If I had it to do over, I probably wouldn't at this price point, but if some of the plusses are what you're looking for it's probably worth it. *** out of *****.", "Date": "October 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Picture clarity is stunning with Digital or HD", "Author": "BJL411", "ReviewID": "R1DRJF0V94ZH9F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only gave this 4 stars because 5 stars represents \"perfect\" to me, and I doubt any product out there made is \"perfect\".First of all I like most am not rich and this kind of money for a tv is insane. But if you've decided to upgrade your older lcd (or) finallys witch from your crt, and you were planning to try and spend around $1000 or $1200 tops, I'd really suggest you wait, if it takes 6 months, wait, and save enough money for a great tv like this.I searched online for the best reviewed tv's in the price range I could afford, and like most of you I wandered into the tv section of Walmart and other stores to see the screen definition and prices of various tv's out there.  I decided if I'm going to make this expensive transition I'm going to wait a few months until I could get the tv I really wanted.  Well I finally have my un46B8000 and find myself watching commercials cuz they look so cool !First of all I am a long time user of Tivo. Mine was the standard digital 2 drive version so I decided to upgrade and order the new XL HD tivo.  In the week while I waited for it's delivery, I was watching my usual cable digital channels on this new tv.  It's IMPORTANT to note that the digital picture is just stunning on this tv... without the HD channels.  Shows look oddly different, like many yrs ago when they switched to video taping our nightly comedy shows instead of filming them.... and I remember how odd the picture looked in video.. it was unusually clear and realistic...  Well I'm experiencing that again with this new tv..  Just watching Two and a Half Men, the new picture clarity baffles and stuns me! it's like watching a whole new program!  and digital commercials,  I actually find myself rewinding to watch them!  it's just odd !!The color intensity and clarity are stunning and THERE IS NO DAMN HUM !!!Also I find the speakers quite adequate though I'm hooking up the new Samsung soundbar (with blu-ray) to this tv today... but the speaker quality of this tv doesn't bother me at all. Plus you can fine tune the sound to your liking.Setup is easy especially with an HDMI cable - one cable! (depending on your setup).  For me it's the normal cable out of the wall into my Tivo, then the HDMI cable out from my TIVO and into the back of the TV, and wah-lah.. it's done. (Only the HD TIVO's have the HDMI connector).CONS: the directions, the booklet and the website suck - Most of us have hooked electronics up before so you can figure it out but if you're a beginner.. good luck with that!  There's no excuse for the lack of info in the huge booklet and the Samsung website - there is more info on this amazon.com page above about this tv than there is in the book (or) on Samsung's site.CONS: I don't like the remote, glad I have my great Tivo remote.  ex: if you want to adjust the color saturation, you'd like to see the picture on screen while you're doing it so you know how much to adjust it.. but sadly this stupid remote and tv have this big pop up screen that blocks the entire tv picture while your making your settings!  so dumb-  I find myself making a setting then clicking \"exit\" so I can view my change, then go back into the \"menu\" several times to set/change it some more.  This is a minor issue I guess because once you have your chosen settings you'll rarely fix it again, but still it's a dumb setup.  My remote also skips around on that menu screen without me clicking anything..  (a flaw in mine or all of them?)  again not a big deal once it's setup but it skips around badly..PROS:  In the menu there are 4 choices for a picture to choose from, \"Dynamic\", \"Standard\", \"Natural\", and \"Movie\".  The pro here is that those could simply be called 1-2-3-4 instead because once you choose one of those above, you can scroll down and change what they are. Meaning you can scroll down and change the color saturation, tint, contrast, etc for each of those items.  My tv is in a very bright room so I set one setting (standard) for day viewing and made a darker screen choice (natural) for night time, which is more soothing to my eyes.Some of the menu settings may confuse you but you need to just play with it, curse a little, and you'll figure it out.PROS: there is a \"backlight\" setting which I am amazed I can keep rather low.  My tv is in a very bright room, approx 12' from a 8'x8' patio door where I let lots of light in for my indoor plants everyday.. I am stunned how well I can see this tv in this bright light WITHOUT changing to any bright setting.  This bright room was the main reason I hesitated for so long from upgrading my tv because I was worried this bright room would be too much for a new lcd (or plasma).. well this tv is amazing in a light environment.CONS:  again the remote - some shows you are still watching in 4:3 ratio mode (old square screen), otherwide the picture looks too stretched out.  Then there are shows that are easily viewed in 16:9 (wide screen).  You need to go all the way into the menu to change this setting if you want a dif screen for dif tv shows, (click \"menu\" then \"Mode\" then scroll down to \"Picture Options\" then choose \"size\")  --- it's insane to have to go through all that to change the screen/picture size.  Again, my award winning tivo remote (!!) has this feature as one of it's buttons easily accessed right on the remote .. just click \"aspect\" and I can change the aspect ratio of any program I'm watching..  But for those of you with just this tv's remote, you'll need to go through all those steps I listed above to keep changing the aspect ratio - annoying!  (Their remote and \"menu\" are a big reason I couldn't give this tv 5 stars)PROS: the tv is light weight enough I could lift it.  The base which you must attach is as heavy as the tv it seemed, but it all looks stunning once set up.CONS: price - ridiculous!  I found it elsewhere and saved $300 off Amazon's price.  I use Amazon to buy lots of items of all types but for something like this I searched google and ebay for a better price (and found it on ebay). Be sure to consider delivery costs (and tax where applicable) when choosing where to buy it.PROS:  thin beyond beliefPROS: blacks are so black that even on a limited black setting, the screen edges (when watching 4:3 ration) are as black as the actual tv frame..PROS: it's a nice looking tv.  chrome base with a thick glass stem leading up to the tv.  A bright, deep, flourescent blue light shows at the bottom when the tv is turned on - pleasing to the eye.. oh and the tv hums a slight tune when you turn it off and on!PROS: I have no glare problems in this bright room next to this huge patio door.CONS: You really do need to be almost dead center when watching this tv for the best picturePROS: The swivel stand is very helpful to put you dead center for viewing.  (Although I'm usually approx 3' off dead center (to the side), approx 10'-12' distance from the tv,  and the pic is still spectacular).CONS:  there is no S connection on the back (if you need one) and the other connections are setup squashed into a side panel.. not the easiest to connect  and some thicker connectors may not work on this tv (as mentioned in this indepth review below)[...]That article (above) is the most indepth info I found on this tv before I bought it.One last thing.  With the new HD Tivo's you need to get rid of the cable box and use cable cards.  When the cable guy came out yesterday he had been installing cable cards (in new Tivo's) all morning.  When he came in and first viewed my tv which was turned on, after spending all morning in front of other people's lcd/plasma tv's all morning, he took one look at my tv picture and simply said, \"wow\".  That was his first impression walking up to it and seeing it's clear picture! (and keep in mind it was still on a regular cable digital picture, not HDMI yet).  So basically, after seeing all those other tv's all morning in everyone else's home.. he was blown away by my new Samsung UN46B8000 !  So there! I have bragging rights! lol.So when watching HD channels or your digital channels you should be very pleased with this tv.46\" is a pretty big tv imo.  This old lady loves NFL and watching Brett Favre and Eli Manning has been great on this new LED LCD tv.  The 2 ms response time is impressive, the color intensity is indescribable, the clarity, and the contrast is spectacular when watching football.  You will need to go into your menu settings and tweak all these features to your liking (sound, contrast, tint, color, black levels, backlight, sharpness, etc.)[...]", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "very nice", "Author": "Bryan Piereson \"BRP\"", "ReviewID": "R2C9UHFS9JHPT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Consumer Reports has not rated this set yet.  Their current top rated set is the samsung ln650, which although good, has minor flaws, such as \"3-ball effect\" (tennis and football), varying shade of green on football fields when comparing line of scrimmage versus either side, and some smudginess.I see none of that with UN46B8000 that I bought last week.  Fast motion is excellent.  White is white, black is black, and reds and blues are beautiful.  Clarity is excellent.  Once in a while I've seen intense yellows and greens where I've wondered if it was an accurate depiction, but I've not made any adjustments yet.

Don't see the use of putting the USB wireless in, it's kind of dumb stuff that you can access if you do, but I guess it is OK for updates etc.  The 240 hz engine interpolates motion, but it has a little cloud or haze bubble that is almost worse than just letting the native frequency do what it can.

Let me pass on a few different comments which may benefit those contemplating this purchase, or who have already made the purchase.To those of you who are skeptical about buying electronics online, relax. Although it is risky buying from those Manhattan online electronics resellers, every step of ordering my Samsung UN46B8000 from Amazon was perfect. Lets start with pricing. After a little web surfing, I found a site that mentioned a significant discount would appear, once the TV is placed in the shopping cart at Amazon.com. I tried it and it worked. For kicks, I printed the page and took it to Best Buy. They admitted they could not come close to matching Amazon's price. Went home and ordered it from Amazon, saving hundreds of dollars. Emails from Amazon soon followed with updates on my order. A couple days later, a phone call to schedule delivery. Two guys delivered the TV and lifted the box cover to verify no visible damage in transit. After a brief conversation, they explained they do a lot of deliveries for Amazon. BTW, I also ordered the Slim-Mount Wall Mounting Kit from Amazon. Best Buy = $250, Amazon $125.A bit about wall-mounting the TV. Two grooved, hockey puck size disks mount to the wall, spaced about 7 inches apart. Another pair of disks connected together with a cable, mount to the back of the TV. You then hang the TV over the wall disks. Like everyone else, all I could envision was my TV crashing to the ground, but it works....scary, but it works. Note, if you need help aligning vertical placement, drill your wall holes 7 inches apart and 22 inches above where you want the bottom of the TV to be. Note to Samsung: Put this in the manual. The instructions that come with the mounting kit are worthless.And now, the TV. More features than I have time for. I noticed a new firmware update had been released, so I downloaded it from Samsung. It's a single executable, which you run to unzip as a folder containing several files. Open the folder and drag the files to the root of your USB flash stick. Plug the stick in the back of the TV and perform the software upgrade. The TV wont find the files if they're still compressed or not at root level. Samsung: Put this on your website. For users connecting their TV to the Internet via the TV's RJ-45 or optional USB Wifi Stick, the process may be simpler.Other process' like deleting unwanted channels are not accurately explained in the manual, but after a few minutes of screwing around, you learn how to select the channel lineup, pick a channel then press Tools to get a pop-up menu and choose Delete. Connecting my laptop to the TV via a 15 pin VGA cable yielded a sweet, finely detailed image. If you're not planning to display movies/pics from websites via an Internet connection, you can still display content from your PC, if your PC has video out. The TV also has a 2.5mm audio in jack, so you can run audio from your PC as well. One other cool feature is by holding down the Volume Down button on the TV for 10 seconds, the Remote Control beeps making it simple to find a lost remote.All in all, a very nice TV with some cool features. This is our first flat-panel TV, so nothing really to compare to. BTW, to the guy who commented on two hot spots on the bottom black bar during movies, I'm getting none of that.

I looked at it on display at best buy and it looked great.  To my disadvantage what was displaying at best buy was a very bright video.I am upgrading from a 42\" HP Plasma tv from around 2006.  I wanted to go LCD this time around as they are not as easy to burn in images to the screen and do not normally have that 'ghosting' experience when going from a still image to a black screen.  Also the Plasma made for a very poor computer monitor.  Having built a new HTPC it felt right to go with a new 1080p LCD TV.I do not like the auto global dimming, but what is worse is I don't like how there is no feature to disable it on the normal user interface and enabling game mode game mode (which can disable the dimming combined with disabling dynamic contrast) disables other features such as the 240hz functions.  If you disable the auto dimming it does make watching things more enjoyable, unless it's a dark movie in a dark room.  Bolt on bluray looked absolutely fantastic.  Lots of bright beautiful scenes, full 16:9 aspect ratio.  This TV deserves 5 stars for that.  When you watch a movie like V for Vendetta on the other hand, it's a movie with many dark scenes and also has the wider aspect so it has the black bars....I was distracted by the glowing of the corners.  Constantly, I couldn't get my mind off it.  You sit off to either side and the edge you're looking into becomes even brighter then the rest of the screen.  Sitting dead center and you can get the full black levels provided but you can clearly see the brighter corners even with the backlighting at 1.  When you have auto dimming disabled you'll see very a very ugly and sloppy black (or as black as it gets) screen between scenes.I cannot comment on sound as I do not use that and I do not use the widgets either (considering I have a PC dedicated to the tv).  I'm not a fan of the remote though, seems sluggish and the backlight is too sensitive.  I just have it turned upside down most of the time.  I do like the features the menus provide, except that there is no option for disabling the dimming.  I actually like everything about the TV except for the backlight.  It'd be absolutely wonderful with a fixed backlight...fortunately there appears to be a fix for that.  I plan on returning this set when I get the 8500 model which has the full backlit led array instead of edge lit.  From what it seems it has all the features and functionality I like with the 8000 series but a fixed backlight with local dimming.  Also apparently menu options to disable it should I want to.  Either way, a nice uniform backlit screen...  don't plan on liking the remote any better though.

After a month and a half of research and one failed purchase (samsung pn50B860 - BUZZ!) we bought this tv from Amazon directly (not from another dealer through Amazon).  I had looked at a few other retailers but Amazon offered a great discount/free shipping/no sales tax - how could we say no?  TV was delivered at the end of the day as requested (I work nights and sleep days) and set up quickly, got lots of good advice about accessories/TV care from the delivery person.The set design is sleek, thin and the picture is beautiful.  Sometimes I notice slight banding in areas (the glow surrounding Harry Potter's wand for example) and the blacks in some of the darkest scenes have faint pale areas but overall one nice set.

I chose this set because the picture was the best for the money, the thinness of the screen, great viewing angle.  There is some reflection on the screen but not really an issue and we have the set in a room full of windows.The menu is simple which is a good thing because the instruction book is not!  The remote is fairly simple to use as well but does light up with the slightest movement as one person noted.  Went to CNET for settings and colors are simply beautiful.  Finally got the kids to watch some Pixar films and the detail is astounding.I was expecting the sound to be much worse after reading some of the reviews but it is fine and of course we have a Bose sound system hooked up to it.  This is our first flatscreen so we need accessories...Will be getting a WIS09ABGN LinkStick Wireless LAN Adapter or perhaps PS or XBOX so we can have our netflix on the system, will update later.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "At First, Problems.

The panel was immediately replaced, curing the obscurred-screen problem. The humming sound, which really was quite annoying, persisted, however. The technician who switched the panel was rather at a loss, as were all with whom I spoke as to what the problem could be. The solution came shortly after I decided to upgrade the cable box I was currently using to a digital hi-def box. Upon installation of the hi-def box, which I had fervently hoped would cure the problem, I was disappointed --- the hum persisted. A tech at Comcast suggested I try HDNI interface, instead of the multi-cable interface that came with the hi-def box. I bought a new, gold HDMI interface cable, just as I had for the blue ray player, and connected the cable box to the TV. Instead of no less than ten points of connection as the Comcast cable required (5 multi-coloured plugs on each end of the cable; 5 to plug into the cable box, 5 to plug into the TV) I went from one plug from the cable box to one to the TV. And guess what. No more hum! Not only was the problem was cured, but the picture went from fantastic to incredible. I am at last able to realise the full value of this remarkable TV set. Formerly, I had recommened that a prospective buyer might do well to steer clear of this set. Now, however, seeing (and hearing) it work as it should, I cannot recommend it highly enough. The picture is bright and so clear as to be nearly 3-dimensional.

I've had the UN46B8000 model for about 3 months now and love it! Honestly, the picture is so much clearer and it's almost scary. People and image move on screen and have such real-to-life movements. I was a bit skeptical about buying an LED TV since it is relatively new technology as far as TVs go, but rest assured, Im more than happy with my purchase. The colors are incredibly brillant.I read a few bad reviews about LED tv's relating to how they display black colors and backgrounds. I actually went to a Big Screen Tv store and spoke with a guy who is an \"expert\" i guess on the subject. He just happen to have an LCD and LED tv next to one another and found a movie on tv which at the time had a ton of dark colors and background images. The difference (and the flaw to some people, not me!), is that an LCD tv displays \"black\" as a dimmed out light. For lack of a better phrase, its not a lack of color, but attemtping to cover up color. LED Tvs have the ability to turn off those LED lights, making a much MUCH richer experience when showing dark backgrounds. Its very much more realistic. To put it another way, If you went walking out at night with a little light near you, you can see some objects, but more remain BLACK. This is what this LED TV does. It givea a Real Life feel to everything you watch.I purchased this TV from amazon as they were much much cheaper then anywhere else - and at the time, I also received the free wall mount for this TV. Havent hung this TV so I dont have a review for the mount. I received confirmation emails as I was told I would. The Receiever of the TV, contacted me when they received the TV from the shipper. Once the TV was on a truck for delivery, the driver contacted me to set up a delivery time. They even called 30 minutes prior to delivery to ensure i was available.

But high def is truely a great picture. But the picture out of the Blue Ray with a BR disc, all I can say is that it is like I have been watching black and white all these years and now I have color. Keep in mind my previous TV was a Sharp Aquos LCD, about 5 years old and it was a 30\" model. It had a great picture.Setup was very easy. The BR player came with the USB wireless dongle and it was a snap to setup and connect to my wireless network. I downloaded the current firmware, took about 20 minutes and went smoothly. Next I put the wireless dongle on the TV and set it up. Difference between the BR player and TV wireless is that the BR player allowed you to type in the network config where the TV had to see the network broadcast. I keep my SSID broadcast off so I had to turn it on for a few minutes while I got the new firmware update for the TV. It went quicker and finished in about 10 minutes.Along with my purchase I did get the high end Monster HDMI cables.

The picture is clear and detailed, although the glossy finish on the screen is very annoying during the day, reflecting light from windows in the room.  Why Samsung decided to make the screen glossy beats me.  The matt finish on my other Samsung is great in a bright environment.  This is a TV, not a mirror, so why make it reflective?!  At night though, with the lights turned off, the picture is really very good and better than my old Samsung.However, the sound quality on this TV is absolutely awful, to the point of being unusable.  One of my video sources is my MacBook Pro, which makes use of the TV's highest resolution to produce a clear picture (although a little washed out, but that may be due to the long VGA cable).  Feeding the audio output from the MacBook into the TV (using a short audio cable with standard 3.5mm stereo plugs) produces VERY poor audio from the TV.  The sound is relatively quiet and very muffled, no matter how the audio settings are tweaked on the Mac or the TV (and I get the same result using another laptop). I get much better sound quality by unplugging the audio cable and listening using the MacBook's built in speakers!  Since the MacBook is thinner than the TV, Samsung really has no excuse for designing a TV with such poor audio.Now, I know that many people will be bypassing the speakers and using an external amp/speaker setup.  This is what I have with my old Samsung (whose internal speakers are still pretty good), but since the TV was for a second home I didn't want the expense of an external sound system.  The sound quality really is SO BAD though, that I'm going to swap the TV's around.My advice is to ONLY buy this TV if you will be using an external sound system, and if you don't have too much light in your room.

The surround sound effect that it puts out is good also. Though I have a sony bravia surround sound system that I do not need the t.v.'s speakers on for movies or when I'm watching sports. I've seen others complaining about the sound from the t.v. echoing with the sound from the surround system. This does happen because the two recieve the sounds a half second apart. This has happened with every t.v. I ever had with the two different surround sound systems I've had. I also seen that someone complained about lag from their video game systems with this t.v. I have not experienced any lag also the picture quality is very crisp and clean for the games. In the manual it says if you put the t.v. in game mode it may mess with the quality of game play. I have not used the game mode nor have I ever used the game mode with any t.v. that I have if it was available. Mainly because they all say it will lower the quality of game play.

The 2010 Winter Olympics were simply stunning with the brightly-colored athletic gear. Great sources look, well, great. The animated movie \"Up\" looked almost 3D, absolutely jaw dropping like you were in the movie with the characters.Some modes need to be adjusted for the source. Motion smoothing does weird things to film-based sources making them look like video. Some may like it because there's the sensation that you are right in the room with the actors, but I find it less than appealing. On other material such as sports, it looks good.With this great picture why the 3-star rating? The TV arrived with a bad remote-- a hugh hassle since the remote makes the access to all its features a snap. Samsung sent another remote but the second was also DIA. Samsung refused to send a technician to the house because \"they don't do house calls for remotes.\" If this situation is not resolved, it will be a major blow to our enjoyment of the TV, something we intended to be in our living room for years to come. I will update this review if the situation improves.Update 3/17/2010: Samsung overnight mailed a new remote and I have to give them credit for this fast response. The new remote is IR-based but has all the functionality of the RF version. I find this to be an acceptable solution and don't see any real advantage to having an RF remote for something that, by its very nature, is not hidden behind cabinets or walls. It was cool going through the menus for the first time without having to kneel by the front of the TV and press its surface-mounted buttons. At this point I am very satisfied with the TV and Samsung, however I continue to believe the three star rating remains justified for the hassle of a major problem upon delivery of a brand new top-of-the-line product.If I had not experienced the problem with the remote control, I would have had no problem rating this TV 4-5 stars.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "This LED TV is awesome!!", "Author": "R.

By the 19th I had no contact from the delivery company whatsoever. I called Pilot and was told that they handed my tv off to another delivery agent (Ryder Logisitics); they transferred me over to Ryder and the man I spoke with said, \"uh, yeah we got it in on the 15th but it didn't get put on the delivery truck in time and we only deliver in your area once a week so you'll be getting it next week.\" Of course I was furious and called Amazon Customer Service right then. Amazon apologized and said that they would contact Pilot and get it all straighted out and because my delivery wasn't made on time Amazon was going to reimburse my shipping fee. By that same afternoon I had a call from Pilot saying they had contacted yet again another delivery agent (Midsouth Trucking) who could deliver my tv on January 22nd. As promised my tv was delivered on the 22nd. However, I did have to unbox and set it up myself (no biggie though). I really have to commend Amazon Customer Service for straightening out the delivery service and getting my product delivered. The ladies at Amazon Customer Service were extremely professional and understanding and I just can't say enough about how great they were to me. The people I talked to at Pilot were also apologetic and helpful in getting on the ball and finding another delivery agent for me.Although at first frustrating, I would highly recommend buying this tv and buying it from Amazon!!1-30-12 UPDATE: This Samsung TV is still going strong.

There are some things that I wished it had such as completely turning off the screen image so that I could just listen to musical channels such as Pandora or various internet channels.--The most disturbing issue that I did not notice until recently was a crackling sound coming out of the speakers on the TV.  I completely turned down volume on the TV and only played it through my stereo and that crackling sound went away.  It started to make that sound after playing it for 5 hours.  I am hoping a warranty will resolve this issue, but I seriously doubt that one.  Most of the time, we either use headphones or our stereo to listen to the TV.  The sound quality of the TV, when functioning, has a lot to be desired.  I've adjusted the bass, treble, etc. and it still has kind of a tinty cheap sound to it like my ancient stereo from 30 years ago.  Personally the LED feature was the primary reason why I bought this TV  because its picture quality is very clear.  They need to work on that sound quality.  And, we rarely used the speaker system just on the TV.Otherwise, the picture clarity is still there.Also, check to see if delivery people will carry this INTO your house.
