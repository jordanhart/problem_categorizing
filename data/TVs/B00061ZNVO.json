Wu \"WWW\"", "ReviewID": "RWF4OJGXSL8IP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd like to start this review with a disclaimer.  I am very happy with the TV.  It works exactly the way it's supposed to.  Problem is, nobody who sells the thing tells you how it's SUPPOSED to work.When you are looking at these things in the store, notice that there is always a DVD playing, or they have the set turned to Discovery HD Theater.  There is a reason for this.  An LCD HD monitor that is showing a regular (I think analog) or even a digital signal will not show well.  The picture quality is lower than that of a regular CRT TV in these cases due to the extreme pixelation of the image.However, if you position the TV correctly in your viewing space, some of this will be aleviated.  For a 50 inch TV, you should sit back between 10-15 feet from the screen.  From that far, you really won't see the pixels, so it won't bother you.  (You can definitely tell the difference between HD and non-HD from this disctance still).  This viewing disctance is what the manufacturers tell you to do.  Do not buy this TV and sit 8 feet away and expect to be happy with it.I say all this not to harp on Sony.  THEIR PRODUCT WORKS JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE'S LCD!!!  You should know this because currenlty only 10-15 channels are broadcast in HD depending on your vendor and region.  Therefore - if you have 150 channels, 90% will not be in HD, so the majority of your viewing will be pixelated.OK - all that said - it's a great TV.  All the pro's have already been discussed - so I won't go there.", "Date": "January 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture in every way except black level and 480p", "Author": "J. Demmon", "ReviewID": "R1QZC63MNTUOAY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is capable of astounding IMAX-like pictures when viewing a good HDTV signal.  Has very good 480i/NTSC up-conversion but only so-so at 480p.  That's because the advanced video processing menu option is only available for 480i and NTSC, not 480p (progressive).  As a consequence the TV does a really amazing job at up-converting ordinary analog tv signals and 480i DVD output.  But 480p component/DVI DVD is NOT as good as 480i component DVD, at least with my Denon 1910.  The sony's 480i up-converter even has an edge over the Denon's 720p and 1080i internal DVI up-converters.  Too bad you can't get 480i over DVI.As others have noted, black level is mediocre.  The screen puts out a glow during dark scenes that can't be adjusted away.  You don't really notice it in a brightly lit room.  But in a dark room it is very much apparent.  Before buying, judge for yourself by playing Harry Potter 3 or other dark movie in a dark room.  Turning on the DVD player's black level boost can help separate dark scenes from the background glow without compromising normally lit scenes.After about a month, I got use to the glow and don't really notice it except during extended, very dark scenes.", "Date": "December 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Incredible picture", "Author": "Thomas B.

Well, This happens sometimes. I've had light bulbs blow that fast. All he had to do was go to Circuit City and get another. He then could have installed it himself, an easy chore. To return a TV because the bulb went is simply foolish.Update:I wrote the above based on what I saw in the store. I now have had this TV for one week and Still think it's great. This tv converts standard signals to HDTV like resolution which works very well. The standard signals are the best I've ever seen, very HDTV like. Some people complain that LCD TV's don't produce deep blacks well. This may bother some but I don't notice it at all. The TV, while not flat, is only 17\" thick and weighs only 83 lbs. It has built in hand holds so 2 people han easily pick it up and carry it around. It has more inputs than I'll ever need (8 components). Thre are optical and coaxial digital outs for surround sound. I couldn't be more satisfied. For $2700 at Circuit City I consider this a bargain.Update 2:Sept 30 2005, After 10 months no change of opinion. We watch the TV every day. No problems at all. Still a great picture.Update 3July 4 2011. I upgraded this TV for an LCD flat screen and gave it to my daughter. It is still in daily use with only one bulb replacement.

Fantastic color and sound quality. Black is not absolute, which is typical for an LCD TV. Black is dark enough however that it really is not a factor.When you get used to HDTV you really notice how low quality a standard broadcast is. I am using a DirecTV HD receiver for all channels including local. I do not get cable or HD good local reception where I am. I can not comment about off air TV quality.I chose an LCD based product because I could see the rainbow on some DLP based products. There is also a squeal audible (color wheel?) with some DLP products. I chose the Sony because it does not give much of a \"screen door\" appearance as some other LCD projectors do.If using a home theatre or surround sound receiver for your audio be sure to get a \"fast\" TV like this one. On some TVs the video processor is slow enough that you get sound and video out of sync.

Let me tell you why simply it is not cost effective to purchase this tv even if it is FREE: Dont do it. This is why.1. These are multiple class action law suits against Sony because all the LCDs they put out between 2003 to 2008 have bad parts, namely a big problem called the OPTICAL BLOCK. They new it and shipped them out anyway. It cost 1000 to 1500 to replace, but the kicker is all SONYs optical blocks for these TV are refurbished and subject to the same problems as the originals.2. Blue or Green or Yellow Dots or lines begin to appear on your TV until you cant see your picture anymore. THis is what happens when the OPTICAL Block goes on these TVs. After being sued so many times, sony stopped making these rear projection TVs. Go to Google or Yahoo and search this phrase, \"Blue dots on my sony lcd tv\". There is more information than you want to read and all of it make me mad I purchase my tv in 2004 for 3500 bucks.3. THey also dont tell you that every 1.5 years the picture lamp burns out and you have to replace it for a whooping 300 bucks a lamp. What a joke. I have have had to replace my 3 times. Sony says, well you watch the TV to much. The lamp is only designed to accomdate 10,000 hrs of viewing or whatever they said. But 300 bucks every 1.5 years is BS.4. The picture sucks if you are not watching a HD Station or a movie. It is unreal how grainy and what this TV looks like when you get it home. Night and day.DONT BUY THIS TV. DONT DO IT EVEN FOR FREE. CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF ON WEB AND SONY KNEW ALL ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS BUT COVERED THEM UP. These Tvs have so many problems the people selling their used TVs are the ones that SONY wheeled and dealed with. THey told me because they recongize their problem they would give me 50 percent off another Sony TV. NOT!!!!!I would not sell this TV to anyone without telling them what they are getting into.

Hoffman", "ReviewID": "R1HEU9OM1UX5EX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned the samsung 42\" dlp before this unit.  The samsung service was INCREDIBLY bad--it couldn't be any better than what is described in other reviews.  I had innumerable problems with this TV, including service calls, washed out images, and total failure.  I finally got them to give me \"permission\" to trade this in for the sony.  This product is far superior.  However, do yourself a favor and get a calibration disc.  This will improve the picture immeasurably.  If you are going to spend big bucks on a tv, pay the money to get the dark/light and color in focus.  How can others complain about the \"black,\" if they haven't had it professionally calibrated?  Playing with the tv menu and complaining is like changing the stations on your car radio and saying your engine now runs rough.  geez!My only complaint also concerns outputs which are limited as another person stated.  However, if you hook up inputs correctly, the output problem becomes mute.  I run a satellite receiver, DVD/VHS, 6 speakers (psb and paradigm) and audio receiver with this TV, so connections are a bit tricky.  I also wish that they had included the computer input which many other hdtv's have--however the price of this tv is somewhat lower than other 50\" so that trade-off seems understandable. For the money this is a great tv, and 50\" is a wonderful size for a larger living room.", "Date": "April 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "It was nice until the optical block went bad...", "Author": "LR", "ReviewID": "R3PM64DLLPFTXV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this TV in November 2004, and now 5 years later, started seeing blue dots all over the screen.

I got this panel a month ago. I have been a audio/video engineer for 30 yrs. Here are my thoughts.I have 3 hi-quality LCD panels in my home, 32, 42, and 47\", blu-rays, 7.1, etc. I also have a 15K plus tube audio system here. I have experience with stuff.This panel honestly blew me away with the accurate color reproduction it offers. The best I have seen, and have seen Sony Broadcast monitors...you name it.Internal sound is good, but not using it. It feeds a 7.1 system in my secondary theater room {man cave}. This panel has never been in a smoking home.I read all the reviews I could find on this.Everyones eyes and ears are different.This panel had 11.5K hours on it via the accesible menu. The original owners I bought it from got it new in 2006. They NEVER did a thing to it, but were aware about how the bulb is supposed to be replaced after so many hours. SO I bought a new one for $61. Much cheaper now than years ago. I truly can not tell a difference between the new one and a 11.5K hr bulb. Incredible. I kept the old one for a spare.I realize this isn't the norm by my readings.I see no artifacts that make me feel the optical block has Any issues. HD signals look fabulous. I put in Wizard of OZ Blu-Ray and it is incredible. Again, color reproduction is A++ along with most all other aspects of video that can can be scrutinized. The ONLY thing I see as previously mentioned is about the black level on certain material.This panel, to me, offers one an analogish digital picture if you will, without digital artifacts.I really am happy. I got this panel on Craigslist when I was looking for a TV stand. I literally got the panel for free!Apparantly many of the panels have been plaged with problems. This one is a keeper. It blows away my other 1080p panels, and this is 1080i. EASY on the eyes, as my vinyl LP's are easy on the ears vs my tube digital system which is no slouch. Feed this panel a HD signal to enjoy what it can offer. 480 looks like any other panel with a 480 signal. Not enough info for a big picture. Why folks complain about 480 is because they are not knowledeable enough to know why standard definition looks only fair vs 1080. Something to Bit@^! about.I am enjoying this alot. I hope your panel is trouble free like this one. This is a new experience for an old gray haired engineer. If it ends up needing a optical block I will replace it...it's that good.I read, if you don't have major issues with this panel, and replace the lamp as needed life expectancy is 27 yrs.

This is one very high class television with all the bells and whistles.  The picture it produces is incredible with either Digital Cable or HDTV signal, and is just as amazing when used with Optical, S-Video, or Progressive Scan component cables from a DVD/VCR.  The clarity, brilliance, and color rendition is A+ through and through.  You'd be hard pressed to find folks to disagree with that.  The area where this TV gets dinged in the same for any large screen LCD, DLP, or Plasma unit - no one likes the low resolution analog delivery when a large widescreen is hooked up to a poor analog cable or worse still VHF or UHF non-digital signal.  So make a commitment now that you are shopping for a big screen HDTV set-up.  If you are willing to spend a couple of grand on a large screen high-end television, you should really give consideration to providing that television with a high-end signal.  That means getting digital cable, satellite (digital signal), a house antenna for free over-the-air HDTV, and investing in a DVD/VCR that has the modern outputs.  Do that and you are going to be in awe each night you settle in front of this television.  Don't do it and you are going to settle for less than this television can provide.I've owned this television for about one year now.  I can tell you that it is highly impressive.  The clarity and depth of the picture are astonishing and the brilliance is fantastic.  Style-wise, okay, the newer model of this same system is more \"modern\" than this.  Sound-wise, this system produces clear tones and great surround.  I utilize this set with a home theatre set-up using Optical out from the TV and am immersed with sound.  And I can say that playing Xbox on this set-up with the MS HD component cables is astoundingly realistic.The really great features too are that this does have its own integrated ATSC tuner to decode the HD free over-the-air signals.  And better still the no need for picture-in-picture when you can split the screen and watch them side-by-side (though you can't do that with two ATSC tuned stations - one has to be analog).But probably the best perspective I can give you is that I treat the guests to my home who haven't yet seen such a high-end widescreen television to a bit of a test.  I display for them the analog every day picture first in full 16:9 view and then in 4:3 standard.  They instantly agree that analog in 16:9 is not sharp, and less appealing.  Then I switch it over to a digital connection and they are back to being awed.  Finally, I tune in an HDTV broadcast and everyone is absolutely mesmorized.  During the Superbowl this year one of my party guests exclaimed, \"Wow!  I can see individual faces in the stadium seats when the cameras are watching the action on the field.\"  Yes, I know.  I get that enjoyment every single day when I power up the Sony 50\".  If you are seriously looking to get a big screen, this one is the absolute way to go!  I'll leave the rest to argue over which is better, an LCD Projection, DLP, LCD flat panel, or Plasma.  I already know.

I wasn't happy that this TV had bulbs that needed replacing. I'm 45 and don't keep up with technology, what has this world come to?! I grew up when you purchased a TV watched it for at least 10 years (how many hours does that equate too?) before you had to buy another. I think I have been through 3 bulbs since 2005 one was an aftermarket and did not last very long at all. I did find out that one of the company's that sells this bulb is only 2 miles from my house so I could get one pretty quick and not pay shipping. So if your bulb has not gone up yet it would be a good idea to have the order information ready or get a spare. I did find out from my local dealer that once you turn the TV off wait a half an hour before you turn it back on. The bulb needs to cool off and can blow if you turn the TV back on to soon. Well about 6 months ago a blue haze appeared at the bottom of the screen. I moved about 3 months ago, for whatever reason when I turned the TV on the haze was gone and there were 4 small blue dots on the center of sceen. 6 weeks later about half the screen is covered with the blue dots and I decided to look into it online. So it looks like I will just watch until I can't take it any longer. I sure can't afford the repairs and from what I have read Sony isin't much help. I'm not looking forward to purchasing a new TV, not just because of the cost but because of the amount of research required.

When I have tried to setup new appointments, my phone calls have not been returned.Sony's customer service is absolutely HORRIBLE.  I cannot even get Sony supervisor's to return my phone calls.  I will never buy a Sony product again.  Spare yourself some major heartache and buy a different brand.", "Date": "March 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "NICE TV BUT.....BUT........BUT....NO VIDEO OUTPUTS !", "Author": "Parag K.

My biggest concern is that i bought this 2600 dollar tv assuming that since it came from SONY, it must be of the latest technology. well, it is except that it does not have VIDEO OUTPUT. How stupid sony can be that it made such an amazing tv but did not give any video outputs. review product description and you will notice it has all kind of inputs but NO OUTPUT. this is the stupidest blunder sony ever made. If i had known this, i would not have bought this tv. now since my satellite receiver does not have multiple outputs and my vcr just like any other vcr's does not have s-video inputs,it is truly a puzzle to figure out what i do to be able to record some tv programs or satellite tv cable programs to my vcr. dont buy this tv if you want to record anything as it might get really complicated since this tv has no video outputs.", "Date": "December 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "Charles Morin", "ReviewID": "R13S7VWGB1QEWH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from Circuit City.
