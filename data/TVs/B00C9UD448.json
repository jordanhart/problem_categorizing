It's not one perpetrated against us, the hapless buyers who can - and have - returned these terrible things, but against your own good people. I hope someone there in your upper management has the humanity left in him to be ashamed. I hope someone reviews the wisdom of attaching a custom adapter that has to be replaced by LG - and only LG - if lost, an adapter that is also comically short, and that consumes most of a power strip.And, sorry, but are molded plastic prices soaring? Is it hyper-expensive to make a solid stand?Dear consumer, do not purchase this or other such mediocre, ruined things if you as I do cling to an idea of civilization.Thanks for reading.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$295.00", "Features": "New - Retail\n1-Year Warranty\nLG Electronics 24EN33VW-B\nLG 24EN33VW-B LED Backlight 23.6inch 1M:1 5ms 1920x1080 DVI/HDMI/D-SUB LCD Monitor", "Name": "LG 23.6IN LED 1920X1080P MNTR HDMI DVI-I 5MS 1M:1 / 24EN33VW-B /", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RoZbd9cRL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C9UD448"}}
