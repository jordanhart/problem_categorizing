It's very stylish, almost as nice as a piece of art on the wall. I have had none of the first reviewers issues which seemed fairly minor. The only gripe i could possible have is that the stock speakers are not the best. But they are normal 10watt TV speakers and I also wish my laptop had surround sound, you get my point. I have it hooked up to my Pioneer surround sound and it works flawlessly. Granted, I have only been using it for 2 months but so far so good. I bought it because i needed something larger than my previous 32\" Samsung. I think this new TV looks much more crisp, with better contrast and a much better price. I would highly recommend this model set to anyone who needs a nice new HDTV. I also like the easy to use remote control.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good for the money", "Author": "Broncoguy", "ReviewID": "R22JGK3C9MOB14", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had this TV about a week now, and I am very pleased.  I am not a video expert or anything, just a normal user, and this is my first LCD TV.  I have looked at quite a few over the past year, and to be honest this one seems to have just as good a picture as most I have seen.  I think it's also hard to tell in the store anyway, because there are always tweaks you can do to the settings- so it's a bit like comparing apples and oranges sometimes.  At any rate, the picture is great in my opinion, and I can't see spending several hundred dollars more for something else.  I agree with the other posters on the sound quality- it isn't great, but to me it's not bad enough to worry about.  Definitely would benefit from a sound system hookup.  Good value in my opinion.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "half the price of my other tv and it shows", "Author": "E.

Good price2.  lightweight3.  good picture4.  picks up both analog (who knew?)and digital stations over the air with roof antenna.CONS:1.  sound is BAD like the factory radio in a YUGO. I was able to make it better through the audio setup, maxing out  bass and trebel then setting eq to the \"live\" setting, but it is still not what I would call good.2.  no digital audio output.  unless you are using a surround sound system that has multiple HDMI inputs, you will not be able to listen to regular tv in surround sound.3.  only one analog (red, white, yellow) input, located on the side.

Leslie", "ReviewID": "R3BVIW98ERURLP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was the least expensive name-brand 42\" 1080p LCD HDTV I could find when I started my search in December 2010.  I found it at Dell for $469, free shipping, but sales tax was applied (why, I don't know).The picture is very nice, but one complaint is with the viewing angles.  If you stand directly in front of it, it's awesome.  Even if you move 20-30 degrees to the side, it's still good.  But, at sharp angles, the picture quality and color washes out with a blue-ish tint.I have a Panasonic 32\" model TCL32X1 that has a better picture with regards to viewing angle.  The picture quality does not degrade at all when viewing from any angle.Luckily, this is not a big concern for me.  I just wanted to let other prospective buyers aware of it.I don't use the speakers, so I have no comment on the sound quality.I don't care for the power indicator light on the front of the panel - it's way too bright.  I covered it up with a small peice of black tape.  This has been something I've had to do with my last 3 TV's, so it's nothing specific to this make/model.The picture is better than the Panasonic in that scenes with smoke and fog are better.  I would call the issue \"banding\".  When watching a movie with a scene with fog or smoke on the Panasonic (which has 720p), the fog shading is not smooth.  It's displayed in shade bands.  This TV does a much better job with those types of scenes, probably due to the 1080p.Overall, I would recommend this TV, especially if you can find it under $500.  The comperable sized Panasonic is still $60~$100 more.  If viewing angles are not an issue, go with the Sharp.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good TV for the price", "Author": "Siba", "ReviewID": "R1AK2GHG3ORDDX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are on a budget and looking for an HDTV with a good picture and basic features, like I was, this is perfect for you. If you are expecting it to compare to a Sony, and for half the price, you will be disappointed. I didn't want the 120Hz because I don't think you need it unless you are buying a 3D HDTV. If you are not watching 3D on it, it makes things look hyper-realistic, almost like you are standing on the set while they are filming. I want to be absorbed into the show or movie, not into the set where they are filming the movie.I have a couple small complaints...1. The remote has very basic functionality, feels cheap, and I can't program it to operate my DVD player.2. There is some ghosting and blurring if there is an action scene where the lighting is dim (maybe due to the somewhat meager 6ms response time, I'm not sure).Even with the minor complaints, this TV exceeds what I expected for the price.  If you are looking for an inexpensive 42\" HDTV with a good picture for watching blu-ray, DVD, and HDTV on, then you really can't do better than this. If you want a TV that has the best picture, sound, the newest technology, and a premium price to match, then by all means go get a Sony.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money", "Author": "Satisfied", "ReviewID": "R20SXIBT196APW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this TV and installed it yesterday.

We have not purchased a new TV in 10 years. I was ready for a LCD TV, but the options are daunting to say the least. I just wanted to plug it in and go. This TV is much bigger than our last and the picture is beautiful. Sound is aweful, but who in the world uses the TV speakers any more? They are all junk as most people have a surround system or a sound bar so that was no issue for me. I had to buy a splitter so I could hook up my DISH receiver and my Wii at the same time and you will need a HDMI cable. Picked up a great one from Radio Shack for 30 bucks.One thing I did not think of was the fact that we have a Dish box that is not HD and uses 480 resolution whereas the TV uses 1080. So, the TV picture is pretty bad until I upgrade our DISH box. However my bluerays and DVDs look wonderful. Great basic TV.Pros: Easy Setup, Great Picture Quality, Nice Looking, very low glare in high light, Great price!Cons: No HDMI cable included, Only one input, and make sure you have external sound.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bargain basement with equivalent performance", "Author": "PenNameHere", "ReviewID": "R36ERQ4IHZAUKZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "*** Edit - update down to 1 star, 11/21 subsequent to discussions with Sharp Support. Full story, read below the \"***\" for my initial review and problem description;I've had to rate this offering from Sharp down to 1-star; a real shame. The picture is good quality as I said before. However, Sharp email support (Aquossupport@sharpsec.com) came up with a different, mutually exclusive answer to Sharp Telephone Support (1-800-237-4277). After initially claiming that I couldn't use Digital Audio output with any HDMI input and requesting I use Analog Audio outputs instead, email support then requested I contact Telephone Support. I did so today, and Telephone Support advised I couldn't use Analog Audio output with HDMI. Either the software cripples the features (the other more expensive Sharp 42\" LCD TV of course, does allow you to use Analog Audio output with HDMI inputs), or the unit is defective. Either way, it's clear that Sharp don't have their story straight, and I suggest unless you only have 1 cable box or you aggregate your HDMI inputs in some other third party device (like the first commenter below), then you steer clear of this TV - rather ridiculous given the 4 HDMI inputs that convinced me to buy it in the first place. Now, how did I solve my problem? I hijacked the headphone output on the TV as my Analog Audio output. Yes, it's a kludge but it works for all inputs and solves my immediate problem. ***This 42\" LCD TV from Sharp is a serious departure from the quality of the previous Sharp Aquos model I had. The picture quality is quite decent, the casing is in keeping with current styles and is a classy-looking thin bezel in gloss black all the way around, and the screen nicely supports full 1080 resolutions. This is all welcome. The stand is clearly of a lower cost build, but works as expected. Here's my concerns, which lead me to rate this model 2 stars at best (we're working through these with Sharp Support before deciding whether the TV will be RMA'd/returned).1. Audio output (analog) does not function at all with HDMI sources.2. The separate Audio input does not seem to function at all, but certainly not with HDMI sources that provide analog audio, and there's \"debate\" with Sharp about whether or not it should work at all with HDMI sources - clear documentation in Sharp's other 42\" LCD TV model states that it certainly will work - but the same rear panel on this model contrasts with suggestions in the documentation that the separate audio input is only for PC/VGA source, even though it's labelled HDMI right there on the rear panel. What?3. Audio output does function with TV as the source, however it's volume cannot be controlled at all.4. No manuals or guides ship with the TV, in the box, at all.5. The built-in TV tuners combined with the LCD screen give a pixelated picture, something not seen on my previous Aquos. I realise this is a qualitative judgement but it's an obvious change for the worse to those in my house.6. The built-in speakers are tinny with poor sound field dynamics, particularly resulting in significant, noticeable losses at the lower ends of the audio spectrum.7. The menu system does not show TV signal strength. This feature has been deprecated and omitted from the model entirely, a confusing departure from my previous Aquos.Summary: nice picture, good value for money for basic installs, but if you want to connect several HDMI inputs and pipe 1 volume controlled analog audio to the output and thus over to an external hi-fi/stereo system, this is not the TV for you - it's not capable of either of these simple aspects (no audio output, nor volume control on audio output).", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "LC-42SB48UT 42\"LCD HDTV,1080p,4-HDMI,2-HD Component,PC,1-S-Video,2-Composite", "Name": "Sharp LC-42SB48UT 42\" 1080p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31I4TSX8DGL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001FH5T9E"}}
