Purchased at end of May 2012, and by mid-October 2013 the power board has gone out.  Seems from my researching online, and speaking with Sharp customer relations, that this is a known issue with this model.  However, Sharp refuses to cover the problem because it's barely out of the one year warranty period.  I realize that, but it's not like it's a 2+ year old TV.  I missed the one year period by about 4 months, so seriously?  C'mon, Sharp.  That's crap, and you know it.  This will be my last Sharp purchase.  Really disappointed.  (TV was great while it worked, great picture, etc., but I actually expect a TV to work more than 16.5 months when I pay good money for it.  The old Sony upstairs in our children's playroom has been working for almost a good 10 years now.  Guess I know which brand I'll buy next.)", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sharp AQUOS LC60C6400 60\" Class 1080p", "Author": "Walter", "ReviewID": "R2RDXP2HS5AOT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV at a great price this is my second one purchased.

It has not worked properly from the first day that we had it.  It would only connect to Netflix about 70% of the time. When it did connect to Netflix, when we chose to play a program/movie, the choice would download about 1/3 of the way and stop.  We'd have to exit Netflix, reconnect to Netflix, rechoose the program and hope it would load.  We'd get a black screen or we'd get a white screen with \"sprinkled\" black pixels on it (I.E. No picture). Sharp's third party technology service firm came to our house twice to make repairs.  The second time they replaced ALL of the electronic boards in the TV. The result: We still get black screen and/or white screen, we can only get Netflix to work about 10% of the time and the TV sometimes just blacks out when we change a channel, resulting in us having to turn off the TV, and then turn it back on in order to have a picture.  When the picture does actually display, it is better than the comparable Samsung's that we thought of buying.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,499.99", "Features": "\u2022Smart TV: delivers Netflix, CinemaNow and VuduTM streaming video, customized Internet content and live customer support via built-in Wi-Fi.
