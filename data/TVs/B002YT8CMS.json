Deep blacks and bright whites, with quick 120 Hz refresh. I am mostly writing this to counteract the other review left on this product that is not actually related to this producty, but rather one consumer's beef with Proscan. (look at the comments on Bob's Review) I called Proscan's customer support to ask about their warranty (wanted to ensure that it started the day my Bro bought it, not the manufacture date). Anyway, I think i might get one also, great value.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent, best value I have found", "Author": "A. Rhodes", "ReviewID": "R1GRU0GIID3LAO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this unit in spite of Bob Gilbert's asinine \"review\"Pros:- VERY slim- Unbelievably light for a 47\" TV- Easy to wall-mount- Fantastic picture quality- 120Hz refresh makes shows and movies come alive, it really does feel like you're watching it in the studio live- 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio (i know, they kind of make up their own ways to measure that, but this TV has unparalleled color vibrance and good deep smooth blacks)- Aesthetically pleasing- Speakers are well above-par if you turn on the virtual surround in the menus. Still not comparable to a real surround sound system, but they are some of the best integrated speakers I have ever heard- PRICE, oh god the price, it's incredible, I feel like I'm getting away with something naughty at this priceCons:- There is a bit of a delay from input device to screen output (about 1/2 of a second), so games kind of suck on this. I was really unable to play my xbox on this due to the lag  HOWEVER, this does not detract from the overall quality of the unit, for TV and movies, this thing is beyond incredible- It would be nice if the capacitive buttons on it had a dim glow or something, I have to put my face about 3\" away from them to see which is which and where to press- It would also be nice if the buttons had some kind of tactile bump or something so you know when your finger is on it.. if it's dark in the room, it's impossible to use the buttons without a flashlight. Usually I use the remote though, so it's really not a deal breaker or anythingOther notes:- I would recommend finding HDMI cables with very flat/slim connectors, as there is not much clearance back there where you plug them in. My \"normal\" HDMI cables had to have their connector kind of wiggled in there for them to plug in all the way, as the connector will press up against the back of the TV. Not really a CON, just something to be aware of- If you wall mount this, you will either need longer VESA screws, or a mounting bracket that has recessed screw holes, as the mounting holes on the back of this are recessed, and the included screws will not be long enough for most standard VESA mounting kits with flat brackets.Overall:TV and Movies: Buy this NOWVideo games: Would not recommend for gaming, too much processing lag between signal and output", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Robert Gilbert's review is moronic.  This is an amazing set.", "Author": "roo2d2", "ReviewID": "R31V9WGYE00O9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the greatest bargain on a proper LED-LCD TV that can be found anywhere.  I ordered my 42\" for $650 from Walmart and the picture is beyond amazing.  My only two gripes are the lousy speakers -although they sound slightly better in surround mode, but not much.  My other gripe is that the hue/tint can not be adjusted when using the HDMI so things like the THX optimizer on certain blue ray disks cannot be adjust during the color/tint tint portion.  But these are only minor gripes considering the unbeatable value that this TV represents.Robert Gilbert's review is colossally stupid.  He did not, nor has he ever owned this particular TV.  There is no way he purchased this TV \"a few years ago\" because IT WASN'T EVEN AROUND FOR SALE \"A FEW YEARS AGO\".  Please ignore this idiot's review.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent TV, Great for movies and alright for FPS gaming", "Author": "DL \"DL\"", "ReviewID": "R5XPYG3O0G4S2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As Altair said it - the \"soap opera effect\".  I would not be able to describe it better.  I have had this TV for over six months now and was blaming my old DVD player and Xbox for inability to convert properly, but recently purchased blue ray player and even blue ray movies look the same, so it's not the DVD player or Xbox.  For experiment's sake I then hooked up my Xbox to my PC LED LCD monitor with one of the regular movies I tried on the TV and saw that it was great.  That shows that the TV is creating this.  To me it seems like a \"too much contrast\" or, like Altair said, \"soap opera effect.\"  I tried various setting in the menu to no avail.  The best way that I found to watch movies that actually solved the \"soap opera effect\" is to hook it up to my laptop through VGA cable.  This completely solved the issue but unfortunately makes my new blue ray player unusable.Also, to add, XBox gaming is hard on FPS games.  I play multiplayer Halo, and it is very noticeable and can get quite frustrating.  Tried playing the same game on my PC monitor and saw improvement in the lag.Anyway, general TV, sports and news is OK. Movies and gaming (FPS) is not.  Solution for movies: laptop/PC through VGA.  Solutions for gaming: 1. get used to it, 2. play games other than multiplayer FPS, or 3. get another TV.----------------------------------------UPDATE - 2/09/2011After posting my initial review I continued on tweaking the menu settings and went into one of the options that I did not turn off before.  It seems that turning that function off solved the \"soap opera\" effect.  The function is supposed to smooth the effects of \"choppiness\" attributed to fast object movement.This is how you get there:Press \"Menu,\"select \"Video\" (by pressing right arrow),go to \"Advanced video,\"in \"Advanced video\" switch \"DNR\" function to \"Off\"That should solve it.I have to say that when I turned it off I noticed very slight \"choppiness\" but nothing that I would consider a major problem.I am upgrading it to 4 stars (Originally was 3-star rating) although I think it is more like 3.75.---------------------------------------UPDATE - 7/6/2013At this point I already had this TV for several years, and would say that it is a solid 4-star TV.  No issues.  With the solution provided above movies look great.  Gaming does lag slightly, but I guess I got used to it, so at this point it is not a huge issue.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Value", "Author": "That Mechanic Guy", "ReviewID": "RAJW26RW5KGS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being the cheap bastard that I am, I had been eyeballing flat screens for months before making a purchase. Now I had researched everything and knew exactly what I wanted and cross referencing that with cost, I came up with this tv. Bottom line is, I love it, it's the greatest tv I've ever had. The picture is perfect, the colors are bold and the contrast is excellent. I picked this up from walmart last year during the black friday sale on it (less than $700 for an led flat screen!) and had to borrow a truck with an 8' bed just to get it home. Needless to say, it's a bigass tv. The best part is that it's so thin I was able to put it back far enough to use a sound bar.This brings me to the very only bad part about this tv, the sound. Considering how thin the tv is, I'm amazed it sounds as good as it does but the speakers are tiny. However, if 90% of your tv watching is just broadcast tv, it's fine for just casual talking as in tv shows. If you are a big movie watcher, I'd suggest a soundbar so you can have the bass that makes you feel like you're in the movie. I was lucky and found a closeout where a high priced one had been marked about 80% off.The only other \"bad\" thing that I don't like about this tv is that blue light that stays on whenever the tv is off. It's a bright blue LED. Now this is no problem if the tv is in a living room away from where you're sleeping but if you have it in the bedroom, prepare to have your ceiling glowing blue. It sucks for those that had the power supply fail but there is a failure rate on EVERY tv out there, even on tvs that cost twice as much but most won't have any problems.As for gaming, I play my xbox on it all the time and have no issues with burn-in, even with playing for 8+ hours. Now I don't play online but I have no lag playing offline games, as soon as I hit the button things happen in the game instantaneously. If you're a super hardcore game that worries about lag in the milliseconds range, you'd be better off with a tv with 240mhz (most cheap led flat screens use 60mhz, this tv is 120mhz, 240mhz are very expensive).Due to the tv being as big as it is, the people in tv shows are lifesized, it makes it seem as though the tv is just a window and you're seeing it as it happens. I guess that's what people in other reviews mean when they say it looks 3D.If I was going to buy another tv, It would be this exact same tv, it has the features and the quality I want at a great price.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "try component cables", "Author": "woody", "ReviewID": "R1ABER8EXBQUF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my proscan about 8 months ago. It was simple to install with the instructions. At that time the picture was good, sharp and I was pleased. The only complaint was as stated in some other reviews had to do with the slow response going from channel to channel especially hi def to lower on my charter cable. As I think back, I don't remember ever seeing my source show up as 1080p even on hi def channels. It didn't concern me too much since the picture seemed very good. About a week ago a thunderstorm blew out my charter hi def receiver. It also fried my HDMI plugs.Actually all four would not work. The tec from charter used a set of component video and audio cables I happen to have to see if my TV was kaput. WOW!!!!! was the picture GREAT. Also there is no lag from channel to channel and hi def is coming in on 1080p. It is like a new TV. I proceeded to purchase a quality set of components from Staples and put on my TV and on my wifes Phillips 40 in lcd TV. She was actually having more problems than me with up and down channel chatter and connection. Both TVs are doing fantastic. Some may speculate my HDMI cable was not top quality. I assure you the two I had were tops from Staples. I have no idea why these tvs work so well with components, but if you are having problems, it may be worth a try. If your problems are still there I am sorry. I only provide this information to relate my experience. Good Luck. P.S.

When i hooked up my xbox there was about a 289 millisecond lag. Not a ton, but definitely ENOUGH to make a difference and make me need to hook it up to my other tv.Correction:It is now a month later and I would absolutely, positively not recommend this tv. The screen lags, it doesnt provide audio when you switch the channel, you cant play video games on it and the buttons on the side of the tv dont even work. Huge buyers remorse now. I either got a defective tv or this thing is just a piece of garbage.  Hopefully Amazon lets me return it.The only good thing about this tv is that it is really bright and the picture can be really clear.

It's a fantastic TV. The video is the best I've ever seen, and I looked at a LOT of TV's at Best Buy and Walmart before selecting this one online. The price won me over, and I bought it sight unseen, and could not be happier with it. I don't play games through it, so no comment there, but I do watch a lot of TV, DVD's, and VCR tapes, as well as wireless-streaming video from Netflix on it. It handles all seamlessly, and the video is fabulous on all. The audio is very good, too, especially for a flat screen TV.The only con is on some select TV shows (Vampire Diaries & American Idol), I find the background audio overpowering the voices, and commercials are too loud - but that's the case with ALL TV's. I suspect that the 2 TV shows mentioned are interested in selling soundtracks a bit too much, and are playing their music too loud, just as commercials intentionally blow you out of the room. I've fussed with all the settings, but can't get it right on these 2 shows - only. All other shows are perfect, so it is them - not so much the TV, but it does suck that they are 2 I like, and I've heard elsewhere that it is a Flat screen TV only issue.

I realize that this is something someone could get used to, and most everything seems to be leaning this way for sports and fast action sequences, so I was holding out that it would still be fine.
