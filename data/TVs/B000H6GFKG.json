{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic television: phenomenal picture, features galore, good looks, but PRICEY!", "Author": "J. Steven", "ReviewID": "R2LPH8Y7V6YX32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This television replaced a Sony KDL-40S2000 I had purchased. During my 30-day return policy I realized if I were to invest (ha!) in a LCD television I should get one with a full 1080 resolution. I returned the KDL-40S2000 and got this model.Out of the box the television is gorgeous, however, a bit wider and thicker than my previous Bravia. Not a problem for me, but check the measurements before you buy.Picture quality is phenomenal; previous to this set I've always been a tube/CRT guy due to their better picture quality when compared to plasmas and LCDs. I think the technology has finally caught up with CRT quality with this TV. Great (but not perfect) black levels and more detail than you really need in a 40\" television. I will say there is a difference between a 720p panel and 1080p panel in my tests. Motion on high definition sources is also very good. The picture quality on standard definition sources could be better, but I am watching less and less standard definition every day.I was surprised by the amount of tweaks and features present on this television. A few notable features include: A full pixel mode which takes your high definition source and displays it pixel for pixel on your set, something I've never seen on a HDTV before. This feature does wonders for sources outputting a 1080 signal, including my modded Xbox which outputs the interface and DVD signals in 1080i. You can literally walk up to the TV and see the pixels 1:1 just like a computer monitor. This full pixel mode does have a caveat, some HD broadcasts have some extra pixels on the side or top of the frame that appear in this mode, but it's a fine trade off for the 1:1 resolution. The extra pixels are the result of the broadcaster and not the TV.The other valuable feature is the ability to adjust the wide viewing mode when viewing any sort of signal including high definition. My previous HDTV was locked into \"Wide/Full\" mode when watching 1080i content. The KDL-40XBR2 lets you choose which viewing mode when watching high-definition content. I use this feature when I watch inside the NFL on HBO-HD. They broadcast the program using a 1080i signal, but the show is actually standard definition displayed in a 4:3 frame (when is HBO gonna start shooting this show in HD?). The zoom mode allows me to zoom the picture and watch the program using the whole screen. I wouldn't have had this option with my previous HD sets.Because I don't like artificial sharpness or edge creation I always turn the sharpness down very low or off on my televisions. Most TVs look ideal when the sharpness is set low so no artificial edges are created. Don't do this on the KDL-40XBR2 because Sony has added some additional control with the sharpness adjustment. When I set the sharpness very low (Min - 10) I noticed the picture became very blurry, especially with text. At first I thought I had gotten a lemon, but later realized this is a feature. When the sharpness is low the TV seems to reverse the sharpness effect causing the picture to soften. Once I bumped the sharpness up to 35 the picture looked amazing with no artificial edges or blurriness.  This functionality is different than most sets, but a perfect example of the level of adjustment the KDL-40XBR2 offers.Great looks, picture quality and enough tweaks to occupy hours fine-tuning the picture. This isn't a great set for someone who wants to take it out of the box and expect a great picture, but instead someone who is used to tweaking their A/V equipment to their preferences. Highly recommended if you've got the cash.", "Date": "September 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Manufacturing defects affecting Sept '06 through present sets", "Author": "Randy Nelson", "ReviewID": "RPDBMHW3APDNG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sony's XBR line of LCD displays are near or at the top of the most amazing on the market in terms of picture quality, but anyone considering a purchase of an XBR2/3 model display should be aware that there is a significant manufacturing defect with displays produced post-August of 2006 that results in extremely splotchy or \"cloudy\" backlighting. During playback of dark content, clouds of bright spots can be seen across the display. Sony has yet to officially acknowledge this latest stumble in their production quality control, but do a search for \"XBR clouding\" and you will find plenty of discussion about this very real problem.I have personally owned this display and the defect was significant enough to warrant a return. I opted not to get a replacement knowing that so many of these displays in the channel are affected. When (hopefully not \"if\") Sony is able to remedy the production problem and get non-defective sets to retail, I would easily rate it a five-star product and re-purchase one for my home theater.", "Date": "December 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "AMAZING TV...But....Clouding Issues are a problem!", "Author": "Bruno", "ReviewID": "R3DI49AKBKJV6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned a 46xbr3 for over a month now. I would 1st like to say that the image of this TV is awesome. The menu options you have to tweak the look of the image is very very detailed. It helps if you run component and HDMI signals and need to have different tweaked settings to optimize look and reduce pixelization. 1080p with your playstation 3, blu ray or hd dvd players. The tv does not run 1080p component, only hdmi and vga, so your xbox 360 will have to run in 1080i (still looks great). The xbox 360 does run 1080p through vga input on this tv but xbox360 makes the screen look washed out.Clouding Issue:There is however a manufacturing defect that is not officially published by sony and no recall is yet in effect. The Sony LCD flatpanels XBR2/XBR3 40\"/46\"/52\" screens have a greater then 50% chance to have a defect nicknamed \"clouding\". I am one of those unlucky buyers. What \"clouding\" basically is, is white puffy looking background lighting, when screen is black. This is not to be confused with non uniform lighting often seen in PC lcd panels; This is much worse and much brighter and heavily blotchy. For most people with this problem (including myself) you can only see this clouding during times when the screen goes black. (credits at the end of the movies, transitions between commercials to tv shows, dark parts scenes in movies and shows.) During these dark scenes they stand out like a sore thumb and make viewing distracting; due to the fact they are very bright and whitish. My experience is the longer the TV stays turned on the brighter these clouds get. When you 1st turn on the Tv they are very faint.  They also have an odd habit of shifting around the panel very slowly over the course of weeks. (as strange as this may sound) I have found the clouding does not discolor or overbrighten the screen when the TV has full colorful images on it. This is why this problem is tolerable and I did not demand my money back, its still not acceptable though. I have read a few users say their clouding is so bad it effects the colors and makes them washed out. Thankfully I have not seen that.Please do not take my word for any of this I encourage you to be a critical thinker and go out on google and seek this \"sony lcd clouding\" issue. I am doing my part for the small community of us who are stuck with this sad problem overshadowing what is otherwise an absolutely great HDTV.In closing this TV is beautiful looking but when you spend this much money you don't want things like this bringing down your morale over the product. If you buy this TV you could be one of the lucky buyers and get an untainted screen and most stores give you a 30 day return policy. I have also heard (not confirmed) that the newest manufactured models have fixed this issue. I gave the product 5 stars despite the flaw, because even with this flaw I love this TV.Best of luck with your HDTV purchases.

The design of the enclosure is unbeatable, in my opinion.  With that said, the response time on the display is 8ms, which is much better than many other cheaper models, but still not the best out there.  I would recommend researching the response time to see how important it is to you with how you'll be using the TV -- many people would not notice the difference between 5ms and 8ms.  For some unknown reason, Sony also doesn't include such common features as picture-in-picture or picture-by-picture.  Surprisingly, it also lacks a Sony Memory Stick slot for easily viewing a slideshow of pictures.  Why Sony has cut such an inexpensive feature is beyond me, but they must have been having some problem with it to stop putting them in their TV's.  It also lacks USB expansion ports, another inexpensive addition considering that you're already paying several thousand dollars anyway.  Finally, why Sony went with an out-dated VGA connection instead of a DVI one to connect your computer to the TV doesn't make sense to me, but an adapter (sold separately) will easily solve that problem.  Those drawbacks aside, I still think it's the best HD LCD TV in that size range, but it certainly could be improved to include features that many other HD LCD TV's already offer.", "Date": "November 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "My 2 cents...", "Author": "Mark \"Mjone77\"", "ReviewID": "R2SAR92DUI0LEE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all let me state that I bought my 40XBr2 for $[...] out the door and I was also lucky to get an August manufactured date.  I was originally going to buy this unit during Thanksgiving from a local store but when I read some reviews about some units having clouding (mura effects) issures, I held off so I could do more research.  I'm glad i did because I was able to save several hundreds of dollars and was lucky enough to get a unit that so far doesn't suffer from clouding (knock on wood).  The reason I mention the manufatured date above is because I heard that August has [...], which is not the case for [...].I currently have my XBR2 connected to a DirecTV H20 HD receiver and a Playstation 3 and I am using HDMI cables on both.  I do agree that the regular SD (standard definition) channels don't look as good as it would on a regular TV, but I do think that it is not as bad as some would say.  I did find the some of the SD channels hard to watch out of the box, but after I made some changes to the video calibration settings, I found the SD channels to be not bad at all.  I know that some people would not know how to calibrate their own TV but with the help of the internet, you can find someone who will post the correct or proper settings.  I know each person has a different taste, but I did find the settings from the link below made my tv viewing a whole lot better.All the HD channels on Directv are great and the shows that are on 1080i are amazing on my XBR2.  As for the Playstation 3, all I can say is WOW!  The details of the games and Blu ray movies are just incredible.  I'm probably going to borrow my friends Xbox 360 this weekend just to see how it looks, I'm sure it will be a great experience also.For the price I paid and the image quality I'm getting, I believe that this is the best LCD TV in the market.  Other features that sold me were the design, 1080P, 3hdmi inputs, and pretty good sound.

The percentage of consumers who have purchased this HDTV and have reported the above problem ranges now from 69.85 to 90 percent. Perhaps, this may explain why the online and retail price has steadily fallen at a rate of almost $100.00 every 2-3 weeks.The clouding backlight issue is primarily visible in low-light conditions, e.g. when watching darker scenes.Sony now acknowledges that they have received some complaints. However, their response has been to send consumers a printed guide with instructions to optimize the picture quality. The fundamental flaw has not been addressed.

Gates", "ReviewID": "R2FNIUUUO752V5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first purchase of a HDTV and it was well worth it! Yes, the Sony is on the higher end of the price range, but if you can afford the extra cost, it is well worth buying. Before purchasing, I did the research, checking out consumer magazines, internet newsgroups, and even reviewers on different sites. There have been some owners that reported problems, but most of what I found has been about the Bravia 46\" sets, not the 40's,  but Sony isn't the only manufacturer out there that are having problems.All the information out there talks about how vivid the colors are and how sharp the resolution is, but that is an understatement! You have to actually watch this TV to fully appreciate what it is capable of showing. Stores like Best B-- and Circuit C--- have the TV's operating when you come in, but the ones I saw in the store, whether it was the Sony or not, did not seem that impressive. Having this set in my house, the picture clarity is so impressive! Now, I don't have cable, so my viewing was off the antenna and satellite dish, and I haven't tweaked it to the optimum settings, and it is still fantastic. I have had no issues of picture clouding that other reviews had mentioned.I chose my 40\" more because of space requirements than desire. I have a limited area in which to place the TV, so the 40\" was my choice. If you really want a great upper mid size HDTV, with fantastic 1080 resolution and fantastic color, than I highly recommend you considering purchasing this TV.

I don't want to come across as someone who is griping about something that was hammered into his head from the beginning of this process: these TV's all look great in HD but SD is another story. It was and we understood the potential pitfalls in advance. So I'll be clear--I'm not faulting anyone for this issue. This is not a knock against Sony as it is a lament on the pitiful amount of HD programming. And I'm looking for comments here. Perhaps we're doing something wrong.Most of the reviews and comments all center around this set's beautiful HD picture. And in HD it's very impressive. Every place we looked at this TV, the programming it was playing was in HD (usually a video). The guy at best buy claimed he couldn't take the TV off of the store's \"loop\" and show us what a non-HD picture looked like. But in SD the picture is really hard to look at for a long time. It feels like I'm looking at an incredibly low resolution picture, as if someone emailed me a 50K file instead of a 50 meg file. The ancient--and I mean ancient--27\" TV in our bedroom beats it by a mile. Do you guys find the same thing? Maybe we're doing something wrong but I find it hurts my eyes to watch such a fuzzy picture for long periods of time. It was so difficult to deal with that we returned the 46\" version of this model for the slightly smaller 40\".Perhaps this wouldn't be an issue if we were talking about a few remaining SD channels and a million HD ones. But the opposite is true. The fact remains that most--by an overwhelming figure--of television programming is not HD. Of the 700 channels on our cable system there are about a dozen channels broadcast in HD. And let's be even more accurate: NBC, say, has an HD channel. So it's great watching The Today Show in HD, at least for the couple of minutes each broadcast that you get HD. When Al and Matt are bantering in the studio, it's HD. But the minute the show does a report from Iraq (where the video wasn't shot in HD) or an interview with someone sitting in an affiliate studio or simply cuts to our local weatherman to see what's happening in our neck of the woods, it's back to SD. It can get a little nerve-wracking, the screen expanding and contracting in and out of HD every three seconds.So for those of us who could care less about XBox 360 or Playstation this becomes a very real problem.", "Date": "December 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "SONY 40\"XBR2", "Author": "ZenecaFluid \"ZenecaFluid\"", "ReviewID": "RRZYDKAL0636K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought it from B*** Buy, I had it about 2wks.

I really had a difficult time deciding between the 32\" and 40\" models.  Both were on display at Circuit City playing the Star Wars DVD.  I loved the 40\" model but they had the 32\" floor display set on sale for $2,200.  Last year the 40\" set was going for $3,500 and the 32\" set for $2,600,  I ending up buying the 32\" set and it has been great this past year.  By far the best picture I have ever seen on a TV.  I was tempted to buy the 26\" set for our bedroom.  A few weeks ago I was here on the Amazon site looking at the XBR2 models and clicked on the price for the 40\" set and saw 2299 pop up with no shipping cost.  I immediately ordered the set.  It took almost two weeks to arrive.  This set is considerably heavier than the 32\" set.  This is partly due to the size, but I think the glass frame also adds quite a bit of weight.  The additional HDMI connectors are welcome.  I could hook up both my DVD and HD DirecTV box using HDMI's and still have a spare.  The 32\" xbr1 is really our benchmark of what we like in a picture and it took about a week of adjustments to the xbr2 to find the right combination to give us the same \"pop\" as the xbr1.  The clarity and color is simply outstanding.  Standard TV is very difficult to watch now.  Small complaint is how deep they bury the sleep timer.  This is especially an issue for me now with the xbr1 as I moved it to our bedroom.  I imagine prices will continue to come down making this set an even bigger bargain.

The TV remote has been programmed to work with an aftermarket DVD player as well.The most important feature of a TV to me is the picture quality. The XBR2 series of televisions stand out in any store that has them on display. The picture is easily 20% brighter than any other Sony model that is currently available to the public. While some televisions are bigger, the XBR2 series makes up for it in resolution. I use this TV in my bedroom. The TV is normally viewed from a distance of 7', closer viewing can show the defects of non HD TV and DVD signals.InstallationQuick and painless is how I describe my install process. I carried the box into my bedroom, ran the component video and audio cables to my Sony DVD player and watched my favorite movie Serenity. Total Installation time: 15 minutes.Remote ControlThe operating instructions provided clear directions to program additional accessories. The remote works with Sony DVP-N5575P a DVD player with component video out and a good progressive scan mode. All of the DVD player's features were accessible from the TV's remote.UseThe menu is easy to use and see on the TV. The auto program feature found all the channels available and took 20 minutes.Our local cable company in Lake Charles is not known for good quality service. The HD signal is very pixelated. My neighbors suffer the same problem with their HD service; we just watch the traditional signal to avoid the \"high action scramble\". As a result, I cannot at this time rate the HD signal quality.The TV runs very cool. A rear projection TV in my other bedroom, a JVC 720p, heats up quickly and puts off a lot of heat in the summer months. Consider this when buying any TV, not only will it consume power but the heat it produces can cause slightly higher air conditioner use.I compared the DVD signal against two other large screen TV's in my house. While not scientific, I could see a difference on the new TV. For example, the movie Serenity has several scenes set against the blackness of space. Both of my other TV's would wash out the black while the XBR2 rendered a deep black. Because of this, you could easily see faint objects that were never before seen in previous viewings of this movie.The sound quality on this TV is very good. I kept the TV at 1/3 of its maximum level and found no need for a surround sound system. DVD audio is just as good.  Save yourself some money and wait to purchase a supplemental audio system until you use the TV for a few days.I really enjoyed the wide range of inputs on the back of the TV. I plugged in one of my computers and watched a few Green Day concerts. Controlling a PC so close to this display was hard though. The computer inputs would be better used as a dedicated image slideshow from your personal digital photo collection.Television Technical Details16:9 1080p HD Resolution Panel (1920 x 1080)Response Time: 8ms, 7000:1 Contrast RatioBRAVIA Engine PRO Video ProcessorLive Color Creation System featuring WCG-CCFL backlightTuners: ATSC Digital Tuner with QAM capability, NTSC, QAMClosed captioningTwo Speakers, 11 watts per channelThree HDMI (1080p) inputsPower Usage: 227 wattsHeadphone JackOne Digital Audio OutputParental ControlEnglish, French, Spanish multilingual menus.Vesa Wall Mount Compatible**NO PIP (Picture In Picture)**NotesI purchased the TV February 2007.

There is no assembly; it comes straight out of the box and Amazon did an excellent job delivering the tv with care.  Amazon's delivery notification was really great and accurate as the tv arrived in accordance with their schedule.  Amazon provided free shipping, which is a huge saving because the TV is quite heavy for its thin shape.  You definitely need two people to help get it out of the box and onto the tv stand.Do not confuse this tv with the more recent HDTV that Sony released, which are dark in color and plain.  This KDL-40XBR2 model is platinum bright with a glass fixture that frames it as if the TV is a painting itself.  This TV goes with any furniture you have in the home and will make you feel like you have plenty of class.  It brightens the room, especially with the platinum and glass tv stand (by Bell'O) that I also bought from Amazon for 50\" TVs.  You do need to get a 50\" stand for this HDTV because it's much bigger than the 40\" you think it is supposed to be--the screen is 40\" diagnally, but the actual size of the whole TV is 44\" wide, 28.25\" high, 10.5\" deep for the base stand (if you plan on putting it on a table or TV stand).Now comes the technology... the resolution is amazing when you're watching HD channels or DVD movies; and the sound is nice and loud--you can even set it to surround sound with just the speakers from the TV.  Be aware though that the TV's default color hues are a bit off, but you can fix it by doing a \"customize\" color, which you'll need to take some time to adjust.  For example, you should find a DVD movie with a night sky (such as New York's skyline), pause it, then \"customize\" the color until the night sky is actually night/dark and not purplish dark.  Having buildings in the picture can also help you make adjustments to make sure that red is actually red and not dark pink.  If the complaints about \"cloudiness\" with its black color is the issue of the default color hues, then those people making the complaints are just too lazy to adjust/customize the colors.  It takes about 15 minutes to correct, and a DVD of a movie that has a night sky (ex. The Contract).Another issue that you should be aware of is that analog channels don't look so good because the TV's natural perfection picks up the imperfection of the analog TV shows.  Analog shows tend to be a bit pixelated, but that's understandable because analog shows look better on analog TV and not HDTV.  However, keep in mind that the government plans to do away with analog channels in February 2009.  By then, all channels will be delivered via HD or high definition frequencies, which this 1080p HDTV will be perfect for your viewing pleasure.By the way, DVD movies that are not HD-DVD look a bit on this TV like the slightly pixelated movies you see in the movie theatres.  This is fine if you want to feel the full theatre effect, but if you want HD clarity in the movie, you'll need to attach an HD-DVD or Blue-Ray DVD player with the purchase of the respective DVDs.The back of this TV does provide enough jacks and connection nodes for a normal person.  However, if you're into connecting every possible thing to a TV, then you'll be a little disappointed by its limited output jacks--only one set for Audio.  As per input jacks there are two for each type of connection: Component, HDMI, Blue Ray and RCA (one additional set on the side of the TV--useful for XBox).  It also has one S video jack, an RGB jack and audio jack for your computer. It has one cable antenna and one VHF/UHF antenna connections.The great thing about this HDTV is that you have four size formats to choose from when watching a show or movie.  The TV screen is letter-box, so if you want to watch analog TV shows in its natural size, you select \"Normal\" and you'll see a 32\" TV screen embedded in your 40\" TV.  If you are watching an HD TV show and you want the full experience, select \"Full\" size.  If you want to watch a letter-box movie that was made for your analog TV, then select \"Zoom\" and your 32\" letter-box will fill up the full 40\" screen.  If you want to watch a regular movie that was made naturally for the wide-screen, select \"Wide-Zoom\" and the movie will fill up the entire screen and you'll feel like you're watching a movie in a small theatre (your living room).Anyway, I pretty much explained everything that I wanted to know when I bought the TV, but had no one who could provide the information.  For example, I needed to know the exact measurements, so that I knew how big of a space I needed for the TV.  I wanted to know if it requires an additional home theatre sound system to boost the sound as some TVs have really low sound at its maximum level.  This HDTV has a pretty good sound system of its own.  I needed to know if I can connect all my periferals to the TV, and for the most part I could--just that almost every connection has to be an input to the TV.  I also wanted to know if the screens adjusted to the different size formats of movies and shows, and of course this HDTV can adjust to all of them.I hope you'll have the privilege of owning this model as it seems that less and less retailers are carrying it.  I don't know why Sony would discontinue its production when it is such a beautiful TV.  Maybe Sony is afraid that people won't buy the other Sony models if they keep manufacturing this one.

I finally decided on the Bravia as it got top ratings on most sites I looked at such as zdnet, consumerreports, etc. The only slight minus most sites mentioned was the price which is a tad higher than other top brands normally. However, when I saw it on Amazon for a good price ($2200) I decided to order it straight away.I ordered it on Sunday, and already on Wednesday I got a call to arange for delivery which I set for friday. The TV arrived nice and early in the morning (I took the morning off from work fearing I might (as per most of these things) have to wait forever). Installation was a breeze. I hooked it up to the HD cable box with HDMI, plugged in the stereo to the TV outputs, the DVD player, etc, and other than a lot of sweat to work all the cables ayway behind the entertainment set, everything went really smooth.The picture is great! After a few days I started playing with some of the display settings and fine tuned it to my likings. I think factory settings are per default a bit higher on contrast and color than I prefer as I like to have the picture a bit more 'au-naturel'. I created a custome setting from the standard with some small alterations on color balance, contrast and such, and I simply love the picture quality.Sound quality is excellent as well, SD picture is great (an often overlooked point for HD tvs).Of course I need to mention some negatives, even if just minor. One thing is that I can't get the remote to bring up the menu of the digital cable. The channel up/down/last all work, but the 'guide' button is I guess impossible to link with any of the codes to the Atlanta dig cable box. Oh well, I hardly ever need the sony vcr (as the cable remote works a charm on the sony), but it would have been perfect if the Sony remote would make the cable remote obsolete.", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "No clouds here", "Author": "D.

Being adamant about gaming and movies I wanted the absolute highest quality TV available. That being said, I did my research and settled on the XBR. I brought it home and set it up and immediately hooked up my Xbox 360 and put in a game w/ very dark environments. I even went so far as to pause on a totally black screen. Not a single cloud, just a perfectly black screen. So I wouldn't one or two harsh review dissuade you from a product as impressive as the XBR. And if it really concerns you, it's always a good idea to go w/ a protection plan a product this expensive any how, so if a problem ever does occur you have your bases covered. It was a large purchase, and I expected a little bit of \"buyer's remorse\". But I am completely satisfied w/ the XBR in every way.

Sarnowski \"Gaming Guru\"", "ReviewID": "R30P9HJZ9JLB5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall the Sony Bravia XBR2 is worth every penny. The Picture is absolutely astonishing and amazing. It's a wonder how I was able to watch tv w/o such beautiful High Def all these years. It is a rather expensive tv, but in this case you truly and honestly get what you pay for. If you enjoy the best then this is the tv for you. With it's elegant design, and picture perfect clarity the Sony Bravia XBR2 offers it all from 1080p to all the features/standards you'd seek for gaming, movie watching, and television shows...Hands down the Bravia XBR2 has one of the best pictures on the market, if not the best picture. Via an HD Cable Box the 1080i is gorgeous, and after watching it for a day or two the real difference really sinks in and quite literally you see things clearly. *wink* Be it Sunday football in HD, or a movie/series on HBO HD. These channels, along with their picture on this tv should be the industry standard. It's hard to imagine how Sony, let alone anyone else will top the picture produced by this Bravia.Furthermore the picture is absolutely stunning w/ the PS3, and 360 as well. Ridge Racer 7 in 1080p is drop dead gorgeous, as other games at even a lower resolution. This is the quintessential television for gaming. Not only is the picture amazing, as it always is in hd, but the Bravia XBR2 offers a Game Mode to further enhance the gaming experience.With 9 video inputs, and numerous HDMI inputs, along with a PC input you can run everything needed directly to this tv if you're not a sound buff like me who has a receiver and numerous speakers. The speakers themselves on the tv sound excellent and Sony has provided a Tru Surround feature so that w/o surround sound you actually get something of the feel w/ just the speakers in the tv.I could ramble on all day about this television as it truly is a work of art, and an amazing television. In case you can't tell, yes I love the Bravia XBR2 and wouldn't trade it for the world. I shopped around and looked at numerous tv's but the Bravia was always the best, top of the line in both quality and price. Why pay the same price for another brands 46\" when you can buy this 40\" which has a much better picture. My only advice would be to shop around online before making a purchase because with any tv the markup is so great that you can find private retailers/sellers who can offer a much better price than retail stores.As for clouding which you'll hear mentioned. Unless you plan to watch movies, shows, and game on a black screen the clouding issue is honestly a none issue. Because of such a bright light used to achieve such amazing picture, when viewing a pitch black screen you might notice some clouding (white, cloudy looking effect on the screen) Switching from tv/video is about the only time you see this. During normal viewing it's not there, it's a none issue. The only time you might notice is when watching really dark, or pitch black movies/games. Even then you can turn down the backlight via the menu to eliminate this effect. imho it's really a none issue with this tv, and not a major malfunction in any way, shape or form. It's a very small price to pay for exceptional picture clarity, and color.", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "broke 2 days out of warranty", "Author": "Keith Gallegos \"kg\"", "ReviewID":

Even my slide shows look really good.The set-up with the remote is a bit time-consuming because there is so much going on -- lots of inputs, and lots of new ATSC channels to deal with. The remote is not exactly intuitive, and I wish there was a way to click thru favorites with another \"channel\" rocker, rather than having to go into the menus; same with external devices. Odd that it does not pick up the time automatically like my other TVs. The remote does, however, correctly manage my DVD-changer and my old S-VHS deck. When viewing the SVGA source, the menus display options for computer viewing, but it then becomes impossible to switch to other devices (you have to hit the channel button, then the menu button to get out of that mode --??).I love the flexibility to zoom any picture in a wide variety ways; I find myself using the \"Wide\" button a lot. The built-in faux-surround is amazingly good, and creates and excellent acoustic image with the screen -- very good for broadcast TV, tho you'll want the home audio system \"on\" for movies.The set is amazingly light-weight and easy to handle, but it does get quite warm after an hour or two of viewing. I wish the set had one more S-video input (it only has one) for my legacy boxes. It is very well finished, and is quite the show piece in the living room.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony wins again", "Author": "Big Guy", "ReviewID": "R1S0A3JSSSIP0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always liked Sony television.

The 900 channels are music channels, which is also a cool feature.

From the little LED lights at the bottom to the floating glass border, it is absolutely fantastic and can complement any room.One negative is that SD doesn't look as good in comparison to the HD (understandably), but from what I understand the SD is better compared to SD on other Plasma's and LCDs.
