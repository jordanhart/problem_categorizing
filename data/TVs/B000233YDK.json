The specs on this Syntax (Brightness and contrast) compare to other in the $2500-$3000 range. I decided this was the best value for my needs. The picture is great and so is the sound (with a subwoofer attached).After becoming familiar with the TV and it's functions, I found a few bugs that should be expected from a company just starting to make lcd's. The first is that RCA remotes control the tv. i have an RCA directv receiver and any button I press on the RCA remote turns the TV volume up or down. Luckily I use a RF remote, so I just avoid aiming it in the direction of the TV. Another small bug is that some features such as the sleep timer are not easliy controlled. To set the Tv on a 30 minute timer, you have to click 3-4 buttons. I am used to just pressing one button. The Picture in Picture feature is very complicated and somewhat slow to display the second picture. And remember there is only one Progressive Component and S-Video input, so your hookups are somewhat limited.I consider those con's to be small and do not change my recommendations of this TV. It shows a great picture, has great sound and is quality built. I returned a $3500 Sony for this one and I am happy I did. Save your money and buy this one - Same Picture quality as those name brands. Customer Support is easy to reach and very responsive, and it also comes with a 1-year in home warranty - WOW!UPDATE - Syntax has repaired the remote problem and updated the screen adjustments (Saturation added)and added a few goodies via a software update.

If it is normal cable like I have, this TV is perfect.  Its resolution will exceed your cable feed.  In fact, an HDTV or even an EDTV, will have to down convert to your feed signal and you may end up with a worse picture than you'd get from this set.  Heck, the resolution of this TV exceeds a coventional DVD.  Also, for occasional computer use this TV has a VGA input, Perfect!Second, consider what you watch.  If you watch movies all the time, maybe you'd want a widescreen.  I usually watch most anything other than movies, so the conventinal aspect ratio I prefer.  Normal programming and sports seems streched and annoying looking on a widescreen to me.  AND GET THIS, a 20\" conventional aspect TV has 12% MORE pixels than a 20\" Widescreen.  The truth of the matter is, TV manufactures push widescreens on consumers not because consumers visually prefer them, but because they are much cheaper to manufacture and they can advertise bigger screen sizes, sneaky!The good:1) Great Price2) Low power consumption (60W, the thing will pay for itself)3) Its less ugly than it looks in the picture4) Great menus and picture control5) Crazy inputs6) Lightening response time (no digital lag)7) Usable speakers8) Good black display (tends to challenge LCD TVs)9) Hey, its a flat panel TV, you just feel cooler watching it and chuckle to yourself for not supporting Sharp and Sony's elitistism promoting advertising and huge profit margains...he he he ha ha haThe bad:1) Whites too bright.

Smith", "ReviewID": "R2ZJIKK9KUF366", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to sell electronics a few years back when I was working my way through college and it is amazing how inept the majority of salespeople are in the retail environment.  For the most part, if the TV does not offer a high percentage commission you can bet that the salesperson knows diddly about the product.  There are however a few people who take pride in their work and do there best to fulfill the needs of the customer.  But sometimes you have to do some research and footwork for yourself if you want to save some cash.  Case in point the \"no name\"  Olevia HDTV (ready) by Syntax.  I did a lot of research both online and in-stores before deciding to go with the Olevia.  Originally I was skeptical of a brand I did not know, but after some research I learned that the LCD panel is actually produced by Phillips, now Phillips/Maganavox.  My old Tv is a 14 year old 32 in Magnavox console.  So if this Olevia lasts even half as long as the Magnavox then I am one happy camper.  Despite what the saleperson told me the TV is capable of True HD, has PIP, and very easy hookup.  I was disapointed with the picture at the store, and the sign on the TV did not mention HD ( or any of the great features on this set).  The salesman told me \"no that ain't HD\", he turned pointed to the bright crisp picture on a very expensive Sharp Aquos and said, \"that's HD\".  If I had not already done the reseasrch I would have believed the salesman and thought  the TV was just EDTV (Enhanced Definition-one step down from HD).  It really pays to know what your looking at when you are preparing to make such a large luxury item purchase.  If you did not have time to research a specific TV at home you might benefit from asking a salesperson to see the companies product description booklet(not all store have this, I know SEARS does), this is usually kept near the register and will have everything from dimesions to (most if not all of the) special features of the set.  Believe me, it was not just PRICE that swayed my to the Olevia, I also chose the TV because of the picture quality.  BE AWARE!  At retail stores very often the expensive TV's are hooked up directly to a high quality signal while the more economical models are hooked up on a split feed which has a weak signal and therefore a poor picture quality.  ALWAYS ask to see the TV through a Component hookup directly off of a DVD player or HD source.  You will be astonished at how much clearer the picture is vs. the split feed most sets have in store.  This is exactly what I did when testing my Olevia, and I would say the picture is 85% to 90% of the Sharp Aquos at around half the price.  It really is a fantastic Television at a great price.  And once I got the TV home I was able to tweak the settings and got the picture even clearer!Be careful, take the time to test TV's with the proper cable hookups, if a salesperson refuses to help you talk to a manager.  Satisfying the needs of the customer is their job, don't let a poor salesperson keep you from getting a deal or the treatment you desreve!", "Date": "March 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Incredible for the price. Read on...", "Author": "I. Kazakov \"I.K\"", "ReviewID": "R3PA67STZKFE7M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me just state for the record that I rarely buy off-brand electronics, and when I do it's minor equipment like cables, etc. But after reading reviews from around the web it sounded like the Olevia held it's own when it came to quality and features. So my journey began...I was very close to spending (...) on a 26\" Sharp Aquos (...). Then I saw the Olevia. For (...) for a brand new set I figured this was a hell of a deal. Not only does the Olevia beat the Sharp in connections and features, it was almost (...) bucks less. So I got one...First thing I did was hooked it up to my PC. On 1024x720 the text was clean, winamp visualizations were awesome, and some of my wallpapers looked incredibly real. Half Life 2 with all settings highest and 16:9 looked fantastic. Then it was time to give it the TV test...I watched a number of sets (Sharp, Panasonic, LG) with regular cable hook-up. They looked like absolute trash, but clearly it was the signal that was coming into the Best Buy/Circuit City stores because the analog cable on my Olevia looks superb. It blows away our old tube tv, and while some channels obviously come in better than others, the general quality is much better than I expected.The Olevia has awesome PiP and PoP features. They allow you to watch more than 1 source at the same time (e.g., dvd and tv, dvd and playstation2). There is a regular picture in picture, a split screen, a 3 PoP (one channel in a big box and 3 others in 3 smaller windows on the right) and even a grid PoP that allows you to view 12 channels at the same time. However, if you're using these to watch different tv channels, be aware that in 3 PoP and the grid PoP only the \"main\" box displays the picture at normal frame rate. The other channels show picture at about 5 frames per second and not at the same time, but consecutively in order. Not a big deal, but something to consider.The connections on the back of the Olevia are more than you'll probably need, and are easily hidden because there are removable panels which allow you to direct the wires through one or two small openings. Awesome.I then put my playstation 2 to work, hooking it up with component cables. The quality CRUSHES composite (red/white/yellow) hookup. You'll never go back. And I played two games, Tekken 4 and Burnout 3, with the progressive scan feature enabled (displays game at dvd quality, 480p). Very, VERY nice. Colors are fantastic, and blacks are very well done.Then I hooked the Olevia up to my Bravo D2 dvd player via a DVI cable. The player features upscaling that can display any dvd in 720p or 1080i (as well as the standard 480p if for some reason you want to use it). With a bit of tweaking of brightness, contrast on both the dvd player and TV I sat down and watched Alien vs. predator widescreen dvd on 720p. WOW!!! The picture is clean, the colors are beautiful, and the sharpness is great. LCDs are known to be bad at reproducing blacks (in other words, the color black, usually it is some sort of dark gray). I cannot complain here. The bravo d2 olevia combination produces dark and rich blacks.How about the sound? TV has two detachable 10w speakers that are surprisingly strong. I hooked the speakers up to an audio reciever and they are now my surround speakers. The TV does have multiple audio outs and even subwoofer out.So, the conclusion? First realize that my comments have one underlying point in mind: I spent (...) on the tv. For that price the quality and features are unbeatable. Most of the other brand name sets costing (...) and up don't even have the features that this tv does. While I'm sure the picture quality on the Sharp, panasonic and sony is a little better, I don't see the point of spending money on those sets unless you are ready right now to get a serious home theatre system.If you're like me, just wanting something good to hold you over until you spend serious cash, buy this tv, and don't hesitate to do it. It has ALL the connections you need, it's dvi has hdcp (which is a copyright protection system which you will need in the future), has awesome PiP and viewing features, 3:2 pulldown, detachable speakers, and a great look (blue led when tv is off is hot). I have had the set for almost a month and have had no problems with the remote, picture or the sound.I wouldn't take this thing back for anything. I got it for under a grand and with the refurbished bravo d2 (...) i have myself a really solid entry level home theatre setup.

Raymond", "ReviewID": "R1Z8BRBTO47JLR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just recieved this unit today.1. Packaging is absolutely first class.  The unit comes double boxed in very sturdy cardboard.  Everything in putting the pakage together appears to have been done with care for the product.2.  The unit itself is very modern with the silver accents and glowing blue stand-by light.  The speakers are removeable, but arrive attached and wired.  The remote I received was the standard version.  Also included was an XGA cable, power cable, and all necessary manuals and warranties.3. Performance.I have the unit hooked up using the most basic connection, a 75 ohm cable (regular cable wire), from the wall to the unit.  I have an HD box coming from Comcast.  I will post a follow up once it arrives.  I have found that the unit out of the box is 7 out of 10.  There is some red push, but tweaking the controls allows you to get a decent picture.  I would highly recommend using a calibration disc such as AVIA to set all necessary functions.  I performed all calibrations by eye and achieved decent results.Colors are very punchy especially with animation, which I would use to show the set to my friends until HD arrives.  Very clear and vibrant.  I used this as a benchmark for what the set could achieve if properly set.  Again maximum settings can be had using AVIA.  Unfortunately, the DVD player has yet to arrive, so I will have to make do by eye.I tend to use the Weather Channel to calibrate my sets due to the computer colors they employ; plus the fact they have people on screen to allow correct setting of flesh tones.  You get the best of both worlds on one screen.  Blues in the background were very full.  The contrast detail was very good.  General human appearance was natural and not to over done.  Be patient doing your tweaks.  It took me three tries over the course of two hours.  Not a straight two hours, but you get the idea.My settings ended up with sharpness being way down, most color setting near middle, brightness and contrast on the lower side of center, backlight to soft, full screen mode, and noise red. to high.  I was pretty impressed by this sets ability to present a decent picture using the worst possible signal.Pros:Color saturationTweaking flexiblityRelative clarity on a poor signalCons:Some appearance of motion drag; minimal at best, and could be attributed to signal strength.Lack of picture streching modes; however full screen does an excellent job of rendering 4:3 material.  It should be noted that I have had a 16:9 HDTV for about 3 years so I am a bit more used to what the signal supposed to be.Shadows are more of a dark grey than black, but no real information is lost in the shadow.  I took me a while to get it, but tweaking can get you a decent shadow detail.  Again AVIA will reduce your time in doing this.Summary:I will be using this set as a second HDTV in the living room.  I have a 65\" HD set in the theater room and a 17\" HD set in the work out room.  I took a chance on this set and have been pleasantly surprised.  I gave it the worst signal I could and still felt comfortable giving it 4 out of 5.  My only question I have now is whether to go to the 32\" or stick with the 30\".I will post a follow up once the HD box arrives, and I have a chance to correctly calibrate the set.PS: the standard remote works fine, and the buzzing sound is barely noticeable beyond 3 feet from the set.", "Date": "February 12, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great BIG TV for a very low price!!!", "Author": "Pyrate83 \"Computer Junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R226GG7Z5Z1OYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this on January 3rd and just received it today and set it up.  I did extensive research before buying an LCD TV and this was what I finally decided on.  I haven't made any changes to the picture yet and have only viewed the set from regular CATV but am anxious to hook up my XBOX and DVD player via component cables since the set looked wonderful at HHGregg watching the Discovery Channel in HD.  The audio output via RCA cables to my receiver is unfortunately not as good as the output on my old CRT.  Not a really big deal though.  The set is very well put together and I like the fact that you purchase an extended warranty through Syntax.  The set is of course very bright and vibrant the way an LCD is advertised to be.  I'm looking forward to spending a lot of time in front of this set and believe it was the best bang for my buck.Updated: I have now messed with all of the settings on this TV and the colors it can display out of any input are amazing.  Blacks look black for an LCD with the backlight on just normal.  Red is a little overwhelming but blues and greens never looked better.  If you intend on watching regular cable make sure to have noise reduction on high.  Another thing that is nice is that you can set color and other video options for each individual input.  The remote really is something to be desired.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it just decides it doesn't work, I can't figure it out(guess it's just cheap).  I would like to get a better universal remote but I'm not sure on the codes.  I have heard Philips codes work possibly?  I might also add that I have removed the speakers that came with the monitor since I use my own home theater speakers.  This really makes the monitor itself look very clean and cutting-edge.  I was skeptical at first but please do yourself a favor and get this set!Updated again(January 11, 2005):  I have hooked up my dvd and xbox via component video cables to this set.  To anyone that doesn't already know, this set does do progressive scan, only on one of the component inputs though.  I saw someone say it didn't do progressive content but it does, 480p and 720p as well as 1080i.  Also, 480p is NOT HD, 720p and 1080i are HD though.  Video games look absolutely detailed and stunning however I wasn't as impressed with DVD content displayed at 480p.  DVD content was very good overall but the sharpness that I experienced when playing the XBOX in 480p just wasn't there.  I have also found it a bit difficult to find the correct picture settings that give me the most pleasing picture.  I am still tweaking the settings though and hopefully I will have them the way I want soon.  My main issue is getting skin tones to look accurate on both regular TV and DVD...the skin color always looks a little washed out but I'm sure I can fix that.  I have also seen some people mention the buzz on this set.  There is a very slight hum that is only audible if you put your ear right up behind the set in a perfectly quiet room.  I swear, this set is super quiet as an LCD monitor should be.  Read the reviews on [...] and [...] I only saw one poor review and that was on CNET.com.  PC magazine even gave it 4/5 stars!

DVDs are crisp and clear when played from our Sony 6800DP Home Theater in a Box setup.We are also running an iMac Mini with Bluetooth KB and mouse into it via the DVI connection and the set functions perfectly as a monitor. We have copied several hundred hi-res images of our favorite paintings from the web into the screensaver so when we are not watching TV or using the computer, the set plays music from iTunes and displays random art images on the screen.  Very nice!The only weakness is the speakers, which I removed since we are using the Sony setup for surround sound.I highly recommend this set.

The picture quality is fantastic, the pixel response is fast, and the quality is solid.  Most reviews tout the strengths of the unit, so I'll focus on just the negatives.1. \"Zoom\" mode zooms in on the widescreen image, not the 4:3 image.  This results in everything being stretched out a bit.  Zoom is useful for removing the letterbox bars on 4:3 images, but what's the point if it still stretches out the image?  Of course, if you watch any letterbox movies on a progressive scan DVD player you won't have this problem.2. If you plug a 480i source into the Y/Pb/Pr input, you get picture noise.  Syntax support says that it's because all signals that go through the Y/Pb/Pr input go through a comb filter which causes interlaced signals to become noisy.  So if you have a game machine like the Playstation 2 that plays some games in 480i and some in 480p, you have to change the cable to the proper input depending on the mode of the game.3. Most universal remotes can't be programmed to control this TV because Syntax is a new brand.  You have to get a remote whose software can be flashed, like the Logitech Harmony 659, in order to control the TV with a universal remote.Despite these shortcomings, I'm very pleased with this display.

Two of the three gave it great reviews (8 of 10 at extremetech) and one panned it. We are glad we took the risk. The picture is amazing. We keep seeing things in DVDs that we never knew were there. Sound was only ok. Decent for a television, but if sound is your object, get a home theatre system (we're running this through the Panasonic 820V - see my other reviews).  I can tell a difference between this set and truly high end plasma or LCD sets, but the difference is small and not worth the high end price. Example: extremetech gives 9 of 10 to a same-size Sharp AQUOS LCD, but you'll pay double the price of the Olevia.Pros:Amazing picture, sharp even from two rooms awayGood size for a small roomUnbeatable price to value ratioAdequate sound as shipped, easy to route through a home theatre systemPC connection was almost plug and play, required 5 mins of fiddling with my laptop, but that was my laptop's problem, not the TVsIt's light - I could lift it and maneuver it by myselfGamer chick note - World of Warcraft looked so great I could just crySet-up and technical menus are fairly easy to navigate once you deal with the balky remoteThis thing is packed like Fort Knox, double-boxed, custom cut plastic foam inserts etc.  The outer box had some dents but the inner box and the unit were pristineCons:Print manual is basically useless. Included DVD is not any betterRemote is poor quality: tiny range, buttons are not intuitive or even logical, they require several pushes and response time to the remote is SLOW when changing channels (5 sec - I counted) We use our DVD remote for most interactions though, so this is a minor issue to me.Can't evaluate cable picture as I don't have cableOff-the-air tv looked pretty bad, but with no antenna to speak of, that's understandableOverall vote:  No regrets. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  My final decision was between this and a Sony Grand Wega 42 inch LCD projection model, and I chose this one. The picture is better despite the smaller screen.If the most important aspect of a television purchase for you is picture for price, this is the one to get. If you can afford a grand or 4 more, look higher up.Edit: This television died a noble death on September 4, 2012, missing the 8-year mark by a mere two months. The symptoms suggest an issue with the power supply, and reported repair costs would equal the cost of a new machine.

It is a great TV and a great value. I'd just like to make a few points that others may not have covered.Many have commented on how good HD and DVD content look. I have digital cable (Optimum IO) and SD looks great too.When you watch SD content (and most programming is still SD) on a widescreen HD TV, you need to change the set's Aspect Ratio to 4:3, otherwise the image will be stretched horizontally and look unnatural. You can do this easily with the Syntax. Black bands appear on either side of the image and only the center portion of the screen is used. But when you do this, you no longer have a 27 inch TV! Its just geometry. When you use the entire widescreen, the diagonal measurement is 27 inches. Give up part of the screen to either side of the image and what's left will no longer have a diagonal of 27 inches. I'd estimate it at around 22 or 23 inches. So, if you're replacing a 27 inch conventional TV, SD programming is going to look significantly smaller. You may want to investigate Syntax's 30-inch model if this is the case.As other reviewers have pointed out, the Syntax, as it comes from the factory, has a serious oversaturation problem with red. But you can fix it with available controls. There is a \"Red Gain\" adjustment on the \"Picture\" menu that can be reduced to restore a more natural color balance and stop the reds and oranges from looking radioactive.Lastly, if you intend to submit a rebate to Syntax, do so quickly. Most rebates I've seen give you 30 or 60 days from the purchase date to get your envelope postmarked. Syntax gives you only 15 or 21 days. When your set arrives, take a few days to evaluate, decide if you want it, and then get that rebate in the mail. From what I've read, Syntax is *not* forgiving about late submissions.This set lacks only 2 things - a big name and a big price. I've had mine for about 3 months and it makes me smile every time I switch it on.", "Date": "May 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Olevia 30inch LCDTV is great!!", "Author": "Robert B.

I have to say this is one excellent piece of technology.  LCDs have always been way out of my price range... that is until I saw this TV.  The picture quality is great, even standard definition looks good (regular cable).  Digital cable looks better, DVDs look great and HD is excellent.  The speakers are loud enough, but if you are buying an LCD chances are you already have a home theater system.  I love the look, the PQ and the layout for all the wiring.  That doesn't mean this TV is perfect.There are some flaws, but none that are bad enough for me to return it.  There is a buzzing that comes from the back light or the power supply, fortunately to make it go away, set the back light to BRIGHT.  As I said earlier, the speakers are loud but not really great, they are very easy to remove.  The OSD doesn't give you the greatest control of the color saturation, but if you call Syntax they will send you a software upgrade and a new remote (mine will be here next week).In the end, this TV isn't really for the home theater enthusiast (those are the guys that buy boutique items or that 60 inch Sony plasma I saw in town), but for the general public, especially with such a low price.  You do get the best bang for your buck, especially when the next comparison model is on average $1500.00 more.PS: Someone on here stated that it will distort 4:3 pictures if you use full screen.  That is true, but the distortion isn't that bad.  Anamorphic DVDs and HD come in without distortion using the full screen.  Widescreen programming on regular cable 4:3 can be zoomed in to use the full screen without seeing the black bars on top or bottom or without any distortion.", "Date": "February 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "amazing product for the money", "Author": "J.

(this problem is way worse on my second unit than it was on the first.)  the sync loss takes several seconds to restore itself, and during that time audio cuts out as well.  there is a fix for this apparently, and i'm waiting for syntax to ship me a replacement component-input module (easy user installable piece).- the reception of remote codes is terrible -- i've programmed my tivo remote to generate tv power/mute/vol and i have to point it directly at the tv, and sometimes even then i can't get it to work unless i'm within 6' of the tv.  contrast this with the same remote sending signals to the tivo -- i can bounce tivo signals off several walls and the tivo still receives it.  (the situation is even worse with the provided remote.)- the input selection system is painful -- there's no code for taking you direct to a specific input, nor is there a code for cycling through the inputs.  you have to click the input button, then cursor through a menu, then hit the right arrow.- the front surface of the tv runs around 105F.  i haven't compared other LCD TVs, but i figured it's worth mentioning that it will be warm.- two good things to say about the warranty replacement tv:  its VGA downsampling seems to be much improved over the original model; and the remote is actually compatible with some RCA codes (and so i was able to configure the tivo remote to talk to it).  the old style remote (which is actually more sleek and less boxy) is not supported by the tivo report.  other web forums indicate people have successfully called syntax to get a software and remote update.overall i'm satisfied, and i would be happy if i hadn't had to deal with replacing one unit, and worse, having to call to get a replacement module for the warranty replacement tv... you'd hope warranty replacement tvs direct from syntax would include such fixes already.", "Date": "September 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Deal for LCD HDTV!

It can be a pain to have to go through menus and then use the volume button to enter the selection.Cable - picture quality of regular cable is pretty lame especially when using the new HDTV box Time Warner gave me. It is unfortunate that they have chosen to pick the aspect ratio for you... you cannot get a regular 4:3 on normal programming. So everyone is fat. But change it to HD channels and I am in heaven... didn't stop watching Discovery HD for a week... Not to mention NASCAR Races in HD are an awesome thing to watch. One bug to report... Using the Yr Pl Pb setting for the input the screen goes blue whenever there is a large amount of white filling the screen... I am sure this would be resolved using the DVI cable which I haven't gotten yet.Xbox - got the Olevia and Halo 2 at the same time. I have never appreciated a video game like that. The monitor just opens a whole new world to video games bringing you so much closer to the action. I regularly move out of the way of incoming projectiles... so the reality factor is out of this world.Computer - I just bought a new Sony Viao and cannot get the screen to work well. Aspect Ratio is again an issue - everything is fat. Pictures are not as sharp as HDTV so there is some kind of resolution mismatch. I am very good with computers and haven't figured out a fix yet.Sound - good for a everyday TV but not excellent. There is also a compressor built in - I guess to protect the speakers. Home Theater setup is a must. As soon as a sound gets loud the compression kicks in and lowers it.If this monitor worked well with the computer I would have given 5 stars.

So its back onto customer support.First guy Miguel (one of these people who completely rubs you up the wrong way from the start - and its not the first time I have had the misfortune of speaking with him) - tells me its this and that and we will send another part etc...etc. I told him I wouldn't be happy with that and that the part they have just replaced is defective - I hung up to calm down.Second guy Chris - I tell him exactly the same as the chief muppet above and first thing he said was \"I'll organize customer support to replace the LCD Set with a new one\", simple as that, no ifs or buts,I'll give them a chance with a new set and see how it goes but after that its refund time. I think this set looks good on paper and for the price but from what I've seen written about it on other forums their seems to be to many little problems to make it a really good 5 star product.ProsPrice, Set looks great, excellent cable connection set up choices, no waiting for customer support to answer the phone.ConsPicture quality isn't the best (to much red), sound is a bit tinny and not enough bass, some at customer support need a good slap for being rude.", "Date": "May 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good but not great.", "Author": "L.

Have my laptop, Playstation, and CATV plugged into it.  Let me start out with the units contast. Contrast, though more like a 550 ratio not 750, is pretty good except in the darker images and scencs.  Played around the the brightness, backlight and contrast adjustments to try to bring out the darker images but could not.  If its kinda dark it might as well be Very Dark.  Unit is not good in showing the variances in darkness.<br />The units color saturation is very good almost vibrant. are Brightness levels are not a problem; even if you have sunlight shining through a window.  The biggest thing that bothers me about this set are the settings for Aspect Ratio.<br />Native on this is 16x10 not 16x9.  This is not really a problem as many other set are this way.  The problem lies with when a Wide screen DVD is played.  If you use the 16x10 widescreen setting is makes the picture seem strecthed extra wide. In this setting you can still see the 2 black bars on the top and bottom.  I hate this because I feel the reason for buying a wide screen tv was to avoid this. If I switch it to 4x3 aspect ration the picture now is even smaller.  The horizontal black bars are now joined by 2 vertical bars on the left and right making the picture seems like it is comming out of a 17 inch screen.  The last setting is ZOOM for aspect viewing ratio.  The nice thing about this settings, i now feel that I'm looking at the full 27 inch screen.  There are no more black bars on the top, bottom or sides.  But the problem here is that is zooms it too far.  Picture is lost or chopped off of the sides and the top and bottom. The only other thing is the proccessor speed in the unit is very slow.  It takes a long time to move between your different sources, CATV, VGA, DVI, and S-video.  Also going in and out of PIP mode is also a lengthy transition.  Otherwise the rest of the unit is fine.  Remote control problem fixed.

I bought sight unseen online from Amazon. Delivery was when they said it would be, set was undamaged.You get what you pay for. No frills, and you need a set top HD converter or HD cable box to get the few HD channels now available on cable, or you have a roof antenna and you'll get the broadcast networks' HD signals only.Just like back in the 80's when \"cable ready\" confused a lot of people, HDTV-ready, at least for cable and satellite viewers, means additional hardware. Time Warner Cable of NYC exchanged my old box for an HD box at no extra charge. The few channels available now may frustrate new owners of these sets, and Time Warner has the nerve to charge extra for a handful of extra HD channels, like ESPN-HD but just remember, back in the 50's, color television meant buying an expensive set to watch color on one channel-NBC- the first all-color network, until the late 60's, when all networks went color. Same deal with HDTV- be patient, in a few years, all channels will be hi-def.Now, onto the Olevia. I like this set and don't regret the purchase, so far. Set-up is a bit of a chore and time consuming. If you are not electronic-savy, you could have some major problems. This is a component TV, meaning the video and audio signals are connected seperately, so when you throw in a home theater audio system and a cable/satellite box, it can and did take hours to get up and going. Connecting from my Panasonic home-theater-in-a-box DVD player's component output gave the best picture although I did not try DVI connection, and my test DVD, The Matrix, looked and sounded quite impressive.The component cables I  bought from Radio Shack are just fine- hi priced MonsterCable is a rip-off, especially for a set in this price range.One big disappointment is that most widescreen movies on DVD are in fact just letterboxed in 4:3 mode. Meaning you still get black bars above and below the movie image. There is a mode where you can make it full screen, using up more picture area of the screen but losing some of the picture image that was originally filmed. So It's a compromise that one day will be hopefully eliminated once all tv transmission is in HD and all widescreen movies on DVD use the full amount of the 16:9 screen area so you can watch a movie shot in widescreen and see the full image the director shot without any black bars.But don't let that stop you from getting an HD set if you really want one now. Otherwise, wait a year or so, or when HD replaces analog in a few years. This set will probably be under $500 by then.I admit the remote's a bit clunky and hard to use and if you are intimdated by remotes or electronics in general, it's a pain in the a##. Ask somebody you know who is tech-savy to help you set it up or get universal remote. Picture quality on HD channels is outstanding. Discovery Channel HD in particular makes you feel glad you bought the set. Analog channels look granier and not as sharp as on your old picture-tube TV.I recommend this set for an apartment or bedroom, not as the main home theater set unless you have a small living room.

There is little to no ghosting (some noticeable in HL 2, but better than most regular LCD monitors I've found) and colors are sharp.  However, hooked up to my Gamecube (with standard cables) the quality sucks and there is a lot of ghosting.  With standard definition TV signal, the quality is also poor.  I have been told though, that pretty much all LCD's are this way with standard definition, that is why when you go to the big electronic stores they ALWAYS have the LCD's on High Def signals.  PLEASE keep this in mind, because you may be very dissapointed if you are expecting an improvement in standard definition signal.  You are most likely to experience a degradation from a standard tube TV.  However, when hooked up to High Def that quality is excellent.  If you have a Media PC like me, this is the perfect fit.  Running Power DVD for my DVD's, and using the Logitech Z-5500 THX computer speakers, with this TV, and you are looking at a very very nice Home Theater setup for very cheap.

I understood that I needed additional equipment to pick up high def TV, and component video cables to get high def resolution with my other devices.  After owning it for only a few months, I began to regret paying $1,000 for it. It may be cheaper now, but beware because it has some issues.When I play Xbox and PS2 on this TV, it looks outstanding.  No problems there.  For DVDs the picture is great, but I began to notice a problem with the picture \"blacking out\" and going to a blue input screen every time there was a bright flash.  This also began to happen when watching high def channels on TV.I contacted customer support and they sent me a new A/V box to install myself at no charge.  It was easy to install with just a screw driver.  It seemed to help at first, because DVDs that caused the blackout problem before were fine now.  However, the new A/V box has an even worse time with high def channels on TV, with lines popping up on 1080i signals, and the picture now stays blacked out for longer periods when there is a bright screen.I called tech support again, and they were quick to offer me brand new TV at no charge under warranty.  This doesn't really satisfy me because I think it may be a problem with this unit across the board, not just my individual TV.  The representative said \"The issues you're describing are usually a problem with the A/V box, and since changing that hasn't fixed the problem, we'll send you a new unit.\"  It just makes me think that they see this problem all the time.  Even though it's free shipping, you still have to find a box for it to be picked up in, and they don't ship your new TV until they recieve your defective one.  This whole process is also very slow.This next issue is something I could have looked into beforehand, but found out when I started hooking up different devices for high def.  There's only ONE high def input for component A/V cables!  This means that if you're like me and you have more than one high def device, you'll have buy a component video system selector.  When I hooked up a selector however, I noticed a purple line going slowly down the screen.  When I upgraded to an expensive reciever, this problem went away.  So the purple line might have just been the particular selector I had, but be aware of that potential issue.My last complaint isn't as bad as the blackout problem, but after a while it wears down on you.  The remote is pretty unresponsive and you have to push the buttons down hard.  In addition, there's no quick way to change the aspect ratio.  If you go from watching a high def channel that's presented in 16:9, and surf to a channel that's presented in 4:3, the picture is stretched out.  You then have to surf through sub-menus (with the unresponsive buttons) to fix the ratio.  I'm always changing devices that support different aspect ratios, so this small issue has turned into a pretty large annoyance.  One button to toggle through the different ratios would be much better!This TV gets 3 stars for it's outstanding high def picture (when it's working properly).  If you haven't seen discovery channel HD you will be in awe when you first experience it.  However, this unit looses a star for the blackout problem, and another star for the annoying remote and limited high def input.This TV seems like a great medium-range unit to get you started for high def entertainment.  Just be aware that you'll still end up spending more money depending on what you want to hook up to the TV.

What I've learned is that DVI is supposed to be better because you don't have to convert the signal in the computer from digital to analogue and then change that same signal back to digital for the LCD monitor. If it's digital from the computer the DVI cable will render directly from the digital signal. I do not know if DVI is better than any of the other cables (component especially). If I get one I'll try to update reviews.If you need more help with the stretching problem, go to the Powerstrip forums. They may have the answer. I found that I did not have to download the Powerstrip program but if you have a 27\" TV and you are using it from a computer, you may need PoweStrip. However Microsoft may also have a program to render 1024 x 720 or whatever the best resolution is. The problem is that, from what I heard, Windows XP does not come with 720 as a vertical resolution and this is what the 27\" monitor needs.So far I am happy with this. I gave it 4 out 5 because Syntax does not handle this stretching (aspect ration) problem, although it doesn't seem that difficult.I would highly recommend that you also consider getting a wireless keyboard. I do not have one yet, but the monitor is very bright and overwhelming if you sit 6\" away (This is as it should be) I plan on getting a wireless keyboard and mouse to control windows media player etc... Like a very expensive remote control... I plan on getting DVI cable and maybe component cables (though I may not need them if I get DVI)...I also will get a simple signal splitter. My computer already comes with a TV tuner. I need to split that signal so that I can also feed the Olevia TV with the cable signal...I believe that this is a better TV than a computer monitor. I find that sometimes there are not enough pixels to render text. A coma like this \",\" is only two pixels. Not a big deal. I think I still like the fact that I can be 3 to 6 feet away and still read it.There is also a program called TrueType from Microsoft. You can look it up and understand the technology easily enough from their website. You can also click \"turn on\" TrueType and you won't be able to tell the difference on a standard monitor. However on the Olevia LCD you will immediately see the difference. However, I think TrueType only comes wit Windows XP. Those with older operating systems may need to download a special program from MS. However, TrueType only does about a 10%-20% improvement, so if you do not have XP, it may not be worth getting TrueType.For those of you who haven't bought this yet, be careful with the tracking system on Amazon. It's very bad. My Olivia arrived here last Wednesday. The tracking system at Amazon either said \"We do not have information right now\" or \"Leaving xxx on date XXX\". The problem was that it was not leaving. It had already arrived and I had missed the phone call. So I had to schedule on Friday for Next Tuesday (6 days after it arrived). I looked at the Amazon tracking every day, and everyday it said the same: \"no info\" or \"Left dock\". I knew who their carrier was (Eagle) did a Google search for their web site. I was stymied for 3 days, until I finally found the site (there's many companies with the same name and this carrier has also changed websites so their empty website points you to the correct place). Their tracking system actually has the correct information!!!! It said it arrived at my local area and the exact date!!!! However this was not reflected on Amazon.When the Olevia arrived, the carriers were very nice and courteous and accommodating. My wife called and when I arrived they were waiting for me with the Olevia unpacked and ready to be connected. I turned it on, on the floor, plugged the cable on after disconnecting it from my regular TV, tried picture in picture. I signed the paperwork. The movers were very nice and were even going to take the packaging but we chose to keep it.The Olevia only comes with a VGA cable (I downloaded the instruction book weeks ago and it tells you what it comes with). I chose to use that one rather than the one I had. It's a simple matter to connect the cable from the computer to the Olevia....  New edit.  It took me about 4 days but I finally fixed the video.  I am using this with a computer only so far.  with 1280 x 768 My ati RADEON 9200 would not render text well.  (You should use that resolution for movies to have the right aspect ratio).  The solution, and mind you there may be other solutions, was to use the powerstrip program.  I changed all their setting to the reccomended setting, but not untill I set the Frequency to 80.00 did the text become perfect. If you are having a wigly screen when used as a computer monitor, do a search for powerstrip, and look to their forums.  You may also be able to do something by changing the setting on your video driver some other way, but I wasn't able to.", "Date": "March 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "20\"- For small rooms and aspirations", "Author": "A.

I had been shopping for a traditional crt tv and had thought I was years away from getting a flat panel TV.While the price certainly attracted me, it was so much cheaper than the norm that I was concerned about quality.  I've had the device for a week now and am pleased to report that it appears to be very good.Although not quite High Definition, this LCD is of a higher resolution than most of the flat planels you may have seen in stores.  Its 800 x 600 resolution is so, so much better than the poor 640 x 480 res on most of the fore mentioned panels.  And it's half the price of most of those low res screens as well!I did not previously have alot of experience with LCD flat panels and didn't know if the screen's advertised response time was fast enough or the contrast high enough.  I can report that I see absolutely no image blur during the fastest scene changes.However, I would have liked a little more contrast.  If you increase brightness enough to see adequate detail in dark scenes, the true blacks become slightly greyish.  I find it a little annoying that the letter box areas are therefore grey - but not even close to being annoying enough to go back to an \"old fashioned\" TV.The image quality, after setting up unit with the included composite cord, was very nice.  However, after connecting my DVD player to this panel's COMPONENT inputs, the picture was great.  I found that I was actually getting the sensation of \"being on scene\" rather than just watching a piece of glass.  Note that this panel does not support progressive video, but the component cable improvement was well worth the cable investment anyway.Although the picture is better in a dark room, it can tolerate normal room lighting as well.  My display arrived with zero bad pixels.The tiny 5 watt speakers were surprising clear and pleasant.  The panel surround is well designed, appears to be well built, and looks good.  The remote is surprisingly bulky especially when pared with such a sleek machine, but is easy to use and has equal range to any sony remote I have.I have some concern over not really knowing anything about this manufacturer or their reliability, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase at the moment.

The picture on a good DVD is excellent.However there are two problems when they are used as a computer monitor, or when watching letterboxed movies.  All of the Olevia products have 3 aspect ratio modes: widescreen, 4:3, and zoom.  The widescreen can be used with a DVD player set to widescreen for a very detailed excellent picture.  The 4:3 is just the ticket for normal TV viewing.  But the zoom mode enlarges a widescreen picture, not on the 4:3 picture.  As such it is only useful for filling the screen when watching a DVD which is letterboxed even when watched in widescreen.  Unfortunately it cuts off the sides of the screen.  There is no mode for watching letterboxed normal TV or tape presentations.  The owner's manual shows a picture which indicates that zoom is to be used with letterboxed movies, as it shows the 4:3 picture enlarged to fit the full width with no distortion in the aspect.  It is not suitable for this purpose because it both cuts off part of the picture and widens the picture to make everyone look fat.  When contacted the Olevia support denied that the mode was incorrect and would not compare the manual to the actual performance.  This problem appears in all Olevia LCD TVs.(...)The only other complaint could be the remote/control options.  It would be desirable to have some frequently changed functions such as the aspect ratio as a separate button, or better yet the aspect could be automaticaly changed with the source so that the DVD input automatically goes into widescreen mode while the AV or TV input is in 4:3.  The input designations are a bit cryptic for the average user, and the menu layout is sometimes frustrating.In all I would rate this as an excellent value, but not for the person who will watch mainly letterboxed conventional tapes/TV.  A little attention to the remote control issues, lack of a driver, and the addition of a letterbox mode would go a long way toward making this the ideal solution for the person who wants a 27 inch widescreen TV without buying a backbreaking bulky CRT set.

I made the delivery guy wait while I unpacked and inspected it, as Amazon refuses returns of 27\"+ TVs.Issues:1)Quite Grainy with standard TV quality signal (good otherwise), but if I turn the sharpness to 0 and the noise reduction to high, it's OK (but there are annoying side effects of this solution - the picture becomes cartoony, and the noise reduction option is disabled on component video in, which I mostly use!)2)channels: I had a regular TV plugged into cable, and it got ~80 channels. The Olevia was only able to display channels up to channel 31, 'till I figured out that I needeed to switch it from TV to CATV mode.3)PIP - was confusing to get working -The UI(User Interface) of the remote is weird - e.g. with many remote UIs, there's a consistent way to select something. In this TV's UI, to select something,1)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit menu to exit,2)sometimes you move the cursor to it and hit enter,3)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit the <right/volume up> button.For PIP, you have to use method 3).I tried to resolve these issues:1-888-Syntax8 (1-888-796-8298),Tech:2 - no answer - tried 2x, then got through and they were helpful.Oddly, their FAQ suggests 1280x768 resolution, while 1280x720 is better IMO (perhaps because it's hard to set up a computer to run at that resolution-I used EnTech's PowerStrip software, which is great!)  I can hook up my 14\" iBook too, but can't customize the resolution, so I see 1024x768, which looks very good anyway.Mine has one dead pixel, which is in the corner and only the blue part of the pixel is defective, and it is always dark, so I don't care. It's hard to find w/o displaying a static blue image. The picture is bright and contrasty, as the impressive specs made me expect.</UPDATE>Lots of great reviews, but here's some key missing info:Review the 3 customer images I uploaded.Zoom mode is defective - instead of being straight zoom it's zoom+extra horizontal stretch, which is not very useful.  Instead of simply zooming in on a letterbox image, it distorts it as well, cutting off the sides and making the image look unnatural.  So for stuff shot in HD, but broadcast in regular NTSC format (which I expect will be an increasing proportion of programming for several years - until everything is HD) I end up viewing a 20\" image on my 27\" TV!!!Newer episodes of The West Wing and a few other major shows are like this, ESPN is mostly like this, etc.I spoke to Syntax support and emailed them, and spoke to management, but they said sorry, they see the problem but won't fix it.  I'll updateD this review.Support was helpful in getting PIP and CATV working right.Otherwise, it would be (IS) a 5-star.", "Date": "March 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Still Going Strong", "Author": "Bill Stockstill \"\"Bill\"\"", "ReviewID": "R11XXN5AHM4EZY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Our Olevia is 6 years old, in use everyday and still has a great picture.

It would turn into a bluescreen until the bright scene ends (a few seconds usually).  We tolerated this problem because it wasn't really that expensive to begin with and it was a slight inconvenience.  Next problem is the black screen.  Around October 2006, whenever we turn on the TV, the light would turn on (the blue led in front) and you would hear the audio but the screen would shut off.  There would be sound, power and you would hear the humming sound indicating the device is on but no video.  At first you could fix it by turning off the TV, then turning it on again a few times.

Can really see difference in broadcast quality (those stations broadcasting regular/cable and those using HD).  [Hopefully, won't have to get HDTV converter - what's televising now is very, very good.]  Have on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).

Use VGA at 1024x768 resolution, display DPI=normal (96dpi).  Set on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).

Don't know what the problem is, and cannot have both VGA and DVI cables attached - nothing displays - blank blue screen.  Since I can't visually tell difference between VGA and DVI performance, VGA cable connect fine.Easier to change SOURCE using remote [source - channel up or down key to select - press volume up key finish].  For some reason cannot use keys on TV directly to change SOURCE [correction - can use but cumbersome].  This is the one inconvenience to this system.Because I wanted a device that could be used as both a TV and as a computer monitor, this was the perfect choice.  I have used Sony VAIO entertainment computers since 1997, so I've had that dual ability - but I had to have the computer on in order to watch TV - now I don't.To have a decent viewable screen (25inches on a 30inch TV); to have the capability of viewing TV without having to turn on the computer; to have a decent computer monitor - THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.

I bought a LT30HV and I must say that the HDTV channels look outstanding as do DVDs and video games.  However, the reception on normal cable channels is horrible.  This is not to say that it is only bad compared to other HDTVs, but it looks much worse than any reception I have ever seen.  It looks like a very bad UHF signal from pre-cable days because everything is very blurry and it looks like its snowing on every analog channel.  Its basically unwatchable.  The digital channels are slightly more tolerable.  But I have a 5 year old $100 piece of crap 20\" sharp TV that gets crystal clear reception from the same cable box and connection.  I have talked to Syntax about this and they assured me that it was the signal coming into the TV.  Since then I have changed cable boxes, used different wires, tried different inputs, had the cable company install a signal amplifier, etc. and nothing seems to fix the problem.  My cable provider (Comcast) offers mostly analog channels for the most popular stations, digital channels for the higher number cable channels and a few HDTV channels.  If your cable provider is the same way, I would STRONGLY advise against buying this unit.  Other than the fact that you can't watch about 75% of the channels from my cable box, the only other complaint I would have is that the remote is very poorly designed.  Also, now that it has taken me a little over a month to figure out that it is absolutely the TV that is causing this, I don't have the opportunity to return it anymore.  So I paid $1000 for this unit to watch a few HD channels... what a ripoff.EDIT:After having this TV for a while, I think my criticism was much too harsh.  Its still true that some analog channels don't come in and the remote is absurd, but I am happy with everything else about the TV.  For some reason about half the analog stations come in fine and half are somewhat fuzzy, though I have noticed similar things with other HDTVs.  The picture on the digital channels actually is fine, I think its a bit underwhelming due more to the signal coming through my cable box.  The picture on the HDTV channels is spectacular.  Maybe other high end TVs reportedly have better colors or whatever but I'm telling you that watching football, baseball, basketball, nature shows, etc is mesmerizing.  Some other nice features that I have discovered are the removable speakers that can be wired directly to your stereo receiver, split screen mode (awesome for watching 2 football games at once) and the numerous inputs available.  Also, the packaging of the TV when I received it was great.  I saw some reviews complaining about the packaging, but I would not worry about that if you are planning on purchasing this TV.Reconsidering, I would give this TV 4 stars instead of 2.", "Date": "September 3, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great LCD for the price", "Author": "M.

I connected it to the three different DVD players in my home via the component input. All are progressive scan DVD players. Picture quality is only acceptable. Also, I had to turn the \"blue gain\" way down. There seem to be a slight blue tinge on my unit.

I was surprise how bright is was. I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. <br /><br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player & computer). <br /><br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.<br /><br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. <br /><br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. <br /><br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P<br /><br />Image quality is terrific.

Below is part of a review I wrote on the AVS Forum website.  I think it touched on all the shortcomings of the Olevia.Sceptre 30\" vs. Syntax Olevia 30\" the results are in....I see there are a few threads with folks asking and comparing the Sceptre LCD at (...) and the Syntax Olevia LCD. I had the Olevia for a week and I just got the Sceptre yesterday. I think I'm the only one who's had both, so here is my experience that I posted on one of the threads. I hope this will help those wondering which one to buy. If you don't want to read the results, Olevia sucks and the Sceptre is great so far.-------------------------I went looking for a LCD at a good price. It had to have PAL support since I'm going to use it overseas. Found 2 options, Sharp and Olevia. Sharp 22\" was expensive and was only EDTV, so did some research on Olevia. Well there really wasn't any info out there at all. They mostly do motherboards, LCD is a new venture for them.Here is my experience... The spec's on the Olevia were nice on paper, the price was right....Setup was easy, my wife did it while I was at work. My first thought was that the brightness wasn't very good. So I did some adjusting and got it to look alright, but still not thrilled. I hooked up my Toshiba DVD via component input and played a few movies. Traffic, Finding Nemo, Usual Suspects, LOTR, Final Fantasy, COPS, and a few others. Finding Nemo looked the best, and I just credit that with the fantastic job that they did making the movie in the first place. The reds were really overblown everytime, and it was still not the best brightness. The listed contrast ratio is 700:1 when I originally bought it, now I see it's up to 750:1 and I wonder how they came to that conclusion, I figure it's more like 400:1 in reality. Overall color, contrast, and brightness are subpar.The quality of the remote was the dealbreaker for sure. The volume would change when hitting the channel button, the volume would increase when you hit the down volume regularly. When I pressed track forward on my DVD remote it would change the volume too!! When that happen I knew that using my Sony commander remote wouldn't make a difference. The remote on the Olevia is absolute junk, they must have spent $1 on making it. The 2 items that drove me to return it was when switching from DVD (via Y, Pb, Pr) to the TV input the screen went PINK with a couple lines of static (I could hear the TV audio)! The only solution was to turn it off and on. Then I e-mailed Syntax Olevia with my problems to see what they would say, my message got bounced.....I hope this review will help people make a decision whether or not to buy the Olevia (I had the 30\" not that makes a difference compared to the 27\"). I did some more reading and found the Sceptre Naga III ....It has PAL support and Sceptre is an respected LCD monitor manufacturer. Dell offers their monitors on their website and last year Wired magazine rated their 17\" LCD TV as a best buy.....So from my experience with the Olevia and the Sceptre, the Sceptre is a far better LCD. It's not even close IMO, so if I were you I'd scrap plans for the Olevia and buy the Sceptre.

If you turn the unit off, the blue \"standby\" light still illuminates, but if you turn it on again, the screen is dead, or lights for a while and then goes dead.2) The TV goes dead: no sound, no picture, no standby3) Flickering of colors, etc.In my case, after 30 months of use, I got the first problem, where it would flicker and then go to a black screen, first when using a PS3 via DVI, and later with HDTV cable through the component cables. Needless to say, this was disappointing after paying 1.3k in November 2004. Up until this point, the picture and sound had been reliable and good, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.It turns out that the root cause for issue (1) is the Darfon 144 LCD inverter, which generates power to light up the backlight. A number of manufacturers use this part and had the same bug. Based on research at yahoo groups, where there is a list called syntax_lcd, you can fix this by either (a) getting a new inverter board for a couple hundred, (b) removing and re-soldering the transformers to the board to fix bad solders, or (c) replacing a couple specific transistors that are testing poorly.Items 2 and 3 above are driven by a complete or partial failure of the power module. There are also other issues driven by a failure of the motherboard. The yahoo group forum does a good job listing and addressing the problems if you read through a couple hundred comments, you'll find your issue, as well as a few others.The group chats include a number of folks had luck with fixes for all three, and I plan to go down that path in a few weeks.

A few weeks shy of two years of ownership, the television died, for lack of a better word.  At that point, the power off LED would not be lit but the television would not be on and I could not turn it on.  Unplugging the television for a time served as a temporary fix, but now the tv is out completely.  My suspicion is that it's a bad power supply (while it didn't solve the problem, I noticed upon inspection that the AC socket 'legs' had broken from the PS and needed to be re-soldered).I've noticed other reviews with a similar problem - the blue/black screen of death.  A Yahoo group devoted to Syntax LCDs has solved that problem if you're interested.  While not the same issue I have, they both stem from cheap construction - substandard components and shoddy manufacturing.That being said, the television performed adequately while it worked and was rather inexpensive.  In fact, Syntax-Brillian has continued to market budget-conscious LCD TVs with some success.

UPDATE", "Author": "Gary A. Bergman", "ReviewID": "R3TENMGV1HB3X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on LCD TV's, and in my research Syntax Groups kept on popping up. It received very good reviews from most electronics magazines, and so with much antipation I ordered the 30\" TV. When I received it I hooked it up to my cable, DVD, and stereo. I immediately had problems. When I tried to route my TV through my stereo system, I found out that by turning my stereo on first, I would loose all power to the TV. The blue light would go out; my remote control would not turn the TV on, nor would the manuel buttons work on the TV. The only way I could turn it on would be to unplug it from the outlet and plug it back in. I called Syntax support and he couldn't figure it out either. I tried using a different outlet for my stereo, but to no avail. I purchased a surge protector, by that did not prevent it either. And now, just the other day, the picture went completely black in the middle of a TV program- no blue screen or anything when I turn it on, although the sound works. It is broke after less than 2 weeks! I am really disappointed. I am considering returning the product back to the on-line store where I bought it from. When it was working, I was completely satisfied with the quality of the picture. This is a good product when working, but I wonder if LCD technology is all that reliable. I might revert back to the old CRTV until they get it right. So if you're thinking of buying one, good luck. I hope it is much more reliable than mine was!April 4: This is an update to my previous review dated March 6, 2005. When I discovered that my 30\" Olevia was defective as discribed in my previous review, I decided to call Syntax support to report the problem. They were very curtious and knowledgable and immediately recommeded that I return the TV to them for a new one. Everything was arranged by Syntax. UPS picked up the old one and one week later, right on que, my new one arrived. I immediately hooked it up and it has been running great ever since. At first I had some streaking in fast-action scences, but I retuned the TV with my cable box turned on, and that solved the problem.One week later, my telephone company installed a new digital cable system. This is the latest technology and far superior to the old analog system. Their cable box is a small modem through which comes my telephone; DSL, and cable TV.Some notes of advice: If you have the connections, use the S-Video input on your Syntax to view either cable or Satellite TV. Even though it will not be High Def. it will be much superior to the RF connection. The picture is much brighter and clearer and the flesh tones are great. Also, use your Component connections for your DVD player/recorder. This also is much superior in quality to the RF connection.I am very happy with this TV. I'm glad I made the dicision to return the old one. I would recommend this TV to anyone.

After using it for 5 minutes, I knew it was going back.  Reviews of this seem to be either glowing or harsh, without much middle ground.  I think the people who like it are those who care only about picture quality, and don't want to use many of its features.  If you only want a TV monitor for a bright room, the picture and sound are great.  However, there are many bad things about this unit that make it just not worth it.  Where do I begin:Black level & buzz - even with the backlight down low, a full black screen on this will light up your room.  And with the backlight on low, the built-in speakers emit a horrible loud buzz.  It is not a faint hum as I read before buying, it is a LOUD buzz.  I don't understand why LCD makers think we want these things as bright at the sun, I am much more concerned with having black look black.Computer - forget about using this as a monitor.  There is no Windows driver for it.  You can tweak it to look good with a 3rd party tool called PowerStrip, but even then any mode change causes it to slip back into unreadable mode.  And DVI did NOT work with my brand new computer - I had to use a VGA cable.  I heard that if it does work, it will only show a signal after windows starts, so you can't see the boot process or DOS.  The screen is far too bright (or loud) to use for hours at a time without eyestrain.Remote - The remote barely works - you have to press each button 2-5 times to get it to go through, and then it only has a 6 foot range.Interface - The menu system is asinine, with the center button being cancel, and \"right\" being enter.  After much use I still can't get used to it, and it still takes a lot of thought to figure out how to do simple tasks.  Just about everything you do has a 5 second delay as the monitor changes modes.Misc - The headphone jack is in the back behind a screw panel, limited aspect ratios (3), very bad std tv image.  I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because it will be good for people who have no desire to use its features or remote.Even if they fixed half of these problems I wouldn't want this unit.  It just has way too many issues.

But unless you're home all the time to receive it, getting the shipment from UPS or getting a customer service response from Amazon is pure hassle.UPS had this item `out for delivery'. I took a day off and stayed in earshot of the door. Nothing. At 6am the following morning (this morning) I called UPS. They won't make the shipment available for me to pickup. The call center forwards two messages to the facility. But there's no point in attempting delivery. This shipment requires a signature. No one will be home to sign for it.So I drive to the UPS facility, knowing darn well this box is on a truck and they can pull it off. Which the agent at the counter does. But while I'm staring at the box, I get a call from UPS on my cell phone. Janet (UPS agent at the facility) says the shipment is out for delivery, sorry about that. In other words, she doesn't feel like going and getting the box to put in will call. I am not making this up. And it gets worse.While all this nonsense is transpiring, I examine the box closely (it's good and beat up) and see that it is a LT27, NOT the LT30 that I paid for. So after all this, I have to refuse the shipment because it is the wrong merchandise from Amazon.For Amazon's part, like others have commented, there is no real customer service. I dug around clicking and looking. You can send an email. Obviously customer service is not one of their strengths.My unit will go back undelivered, despite my efforts to retrieve it myself. Amazon, eventually, I assume, will credit me for the failed order fulfillment. Eventually.Now I'm looking to buy the Olevia elsewhere, as I definitely still want it. Somewhere with a customer service phone number. And who ships FedEx.*******UPDATE*******There are plenty of places to buy this unit with good customer service and who ship FedEx. The folks at IBuy Digital called me (not me trying in vain to reach them) to verify information about the order. And as always, FedEx was right on schedule. I can just about set my clock by these guys.Important points about the LCD buyers may value, in no particular order.If using as a monitor, you need a deep workspace. I had to rework mine. The minimum comfortable distance for me with this LCD is more than 4 feet. Most desks aren't that deep.Resolution and refresh are critical. I settled on 1280x960 at 60Hz. I also found a ClearType Tuner power tool to finesse the text to be as clear as possible.I am using a 2PC KVM, with just a VGA connection to the Olevia. With resolutions and refresh set the same, the only issue is sometimes switching back and forth the Olevia sets brightness and contrast back to defaults. It takes 10 seconds to fix.I have a PC attached to the Olevia with an ATI All In Wonder. Easylook Media Center with remote is a nice way to use this unit.Text is OK. My wife thinks detailed graphics work might be difficult. I will probably try it anyway. Games look fantastic.Composite video and DVD from a PC also look fantastic. Analog TV shows itself for what it is, crap. This is something that goes unnoticed until you directly A-B analog TV with composite DVD video. I will switch to HDTV immediately. Which brings up PIP. This unit has true dual NTSC tuners, which is true PIP. But for HDTV, you still need a set top HDTV box from the cable company. So there's a compromise in there.There's also a limitation with split screen and PIP. Inputs are in 'groups', so you can't always get the combination you want.I'm having no trouble with the remote. But I'm always in proximity to the LCD. As others have commented, you have to use the right arrow key in lot of settings where Enter makes more sense. It's stupid, but you just get used to it.Overall, you will get immediately spoiled with one of these. The dual 19's at my mixing console suddenly look a little small.

The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player &amp; computer). &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids.

The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits.

Unfortunately, after reading that review, I did order the Olevia for my Son's birthday.  The TV arrived defective.  The audio worked just fine, but the video would not work.Olevia packages the TV with a sheet directing you to call their toll free number in case there is a problem.  I called the 800 number and described the problem to them. Olevia's tech support advised that the motherboard needed to be replaced.  Olevia offered to send me a new motherboard that would be installed by a local technician, BUT advised it would take 3 days from date of shipment to receive, and since it was now Friday, I would have to call back on Monday since all shipments were already picked up.  Compounding the issue was the fact that I couldn't schedule a tech until the motherboard arrived.Olevia suggested that I contact Amazon.  After an hour of searching Amazon's site, I realized that Amazon does not offer an option to call them.  There's no phone number on their site.  You must submit a form, explain the problem in writing, and request resolution.

Please use the link above to send us your reply.Best regards,Pramod T.Amazon.com Customer Servicehttp://www.amazon.com==============================Given the urgency of the occasion, I went to a local store and purchased a replacement LCD TV for my son's birthday.I responded back to Amazon requesting that they pick up the defective TV.  They advised via return email that the package would be picked up \"usually within a day or two\".To Amazon's credit, they did have the TV picked up the next day.I can't begin to describe the inconvenience.  Imagine the time involved in selecting the TV on Amazon's website.  Ordering, waiting at home for the delivery and the return.  Writing countless letters back and forth (I've not yet received any indication that they've credited my credit card for the returned item), and ultimately replacing the TV with a brand name (Panasonic) at a local merchant.Compare that to my experience purchasing the replacement.  The replacement was purchased from a local merchant.  The local merchant gave me a better price for the name brand merchandise than Amazon was charging for the identical unit.  The merchant delivered the set to my home with same day service (I tipped the salesman $100 to drop it off after work).  My son got his birthday present on his Birthday and it worked right out of the box.Bottom line: DON'T BUY this set from Olevia.Amazon is a great company.  But... I think they should have a toll free number for returns of defective merchandise and respond quicker (to be fair, Amazon's response may have been quicker if it hadn't been so close to the Xmas season)I've had very good experiences with Amazon, but I would NEVER buy anything with a critical time line (birthday, Xmas gifts, etc.) from Amazon again.
