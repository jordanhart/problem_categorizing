{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV, Great Value, Few of the Issues You Are Worrying About", "Author": "Drew Miller \"@drewmillerATL\"", "ReviewID": "R2IJXB3SWIRWR3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bottom line: Beautiful picture (black is really black!), nice internet functionality, and little impact from the issues that have been noted here and elsewhere.Prior to making this purchase I did many hours of online reading that consisted of: CNET, AV/high def message boards and reviews, and Amazon reviews and comments. I asked myself the same questions most TV purchasers ask themselves: plasma vs. LED/LCD, Samsung vs. Panasonic, etc. I purchased the 60ST50 from Amazon and it was delivered in the middle of June 2012. By way of background, I own three other LCD's (one of them an LED/LCD) and this was my first foray into plasma. I felt like plasma was a low risk choice for this TV as it is going in a basement with no windows.The general consensus online is that the ST50 is the best value available for an excellent picture. Always wanting to get the biggest bang for my buck, this consensus opinion was the number one factor in my decision.As I said, I read a lot of reviews and, despite the consensus above, had a number of reservations because of issues that others encountered with the ST50. Here is a summary of my concerns and my findings. I should note that I ran the screen prep slides that you can find out there on the message boards and then played around with two different suggested calibration settings. I have no idea whether the screen prep slides are necessary and can't say whether they prepared my screen for calibration. What HAS been proven is that I am a serious nerd.Screen buzzing: Some reviews have noted screen buzz. I was very concerned out of the gate as the screen prep slides have a white slide. When this slide was shown and all of the phosphors were glowing at 100%, there was a clear buzz emanating from the TV. You could hear it from everywhere in the small room where I was prepping the TV (what a nerd!). The good news is that the buzzing actually reduced over the time that I ran the slides. In a larger room watching actual TV content, it is not audible from in front of the panel even when the content is quiet. If you stick your head behind it, you can still hear a low buzz. My recommendation: do not buy this television if you plan to watch it from behind. Otherwise, if you will be watching it conventionally you should be relieved to hear that I have no issues with buzzing after the break-in period.Viewing in a bright room: As noted, this television is for my basement but I had a chance to view it in a fairly bright room and with ceiling lights above. Generally, no issues. The filter works fairly well. I could see issues if you had a room with lots of bright sunlight where the windows could reflect off the panel. If that's your situation, you're probably considering LED/LCD anyway. Only you can decide what's right for your individual circumstances.Image retention: Another early scare: my Directv rebooted and the directv logo was onscreen for 15 minutes or so. When it was finished the image was retained as a shadow for 30 seconds or so and then it went away. Gave me a quick scare but wasn't anything to be concerned about. I have had the menus open for decent amounts of time. I have watched channels with logos. I have watched several movies with black bars on the top and bottom. No further issues.Hockey: The one entertaining guy in the Amazon reviews that had hockey issues might have scared me. But I don't watch hockey. I have, though, watched baseball, basketball, football, soccer, golf, track and field, etc. They all look great. No issues.Some reviews have noted that the picture is too dark relative to an LED/LCD, has no pop, and looks washed out. I will tell you that the picture is different from an LED/LCD. This television has very lifelike pictures and colors. It's a very refreshing change. The best part of this television are the blacks which are really black. My wife, who usually doesn't notice such things, said, \"Wow! The picture is so bright.\" (Hint for those that don't find it bright enough after calibration - adjust the gamma setting for instant brightness).I really like this television and am happy with my purchase. If that changes over time, I will update this review.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Winner winner chicken dinner", "Author": "S. Hill", "ReviewID": "RNIMNP3FMIYIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(EDIT: review of the 60\" if that matters)Where I'm coming from: I don't use 3D. I hate motion blur but I also hate \"smoothing\" technology. I haven't upgraded my sound yet so I'm using the stock speakers. I tried 3 plasmas from 2011 and each one had some sort of flicker or brightness pop that was just unacceptable. Here's my review.IQ: Head and shoulders above what I've seen in the same price point of last years plasmas and this years LED. The colors are capable of natural skin tones and vibrant digital images. My wife and I randomly say \"wow\" while watching blu-rays. It's really impressive. Part of this success I attribute to...Black levels: I was never out for the best black levels since it appeared to be expensive to have \"the best\". Now that I have a TV with amazing black levels I understand the draw and I must say it is worth it to seek that out when shopping. Dark scenes keep you immersed in what's going on and still delivers amazing detail in blacks and grays that most likely were lost on other TVs. One thing stood out to me, the bezel and the letterboxes are the same color black. I never got the feeling I was watching a movie with letterboxes at all. Neat.Glare: Glare is hard to rate since everyone has different setups. I have a slider behind me while watching TV and during the day it's not bad with a little down tilt thanks to my wall mount. I don't do much daytime viewing so it's not become a problem.Stand: The TV stand is sturdy but quite deep. It takes up my entire entertainment center top (~15\"). There are zero adjustments to make like tilt or swivel so I could see that base creating issues if you intend on it being anything other than straight on viewing without deeper furniture.Bezel: The ST30 was really ugly. It played a part in why I didn't buy it. This years is quite an improvement and I find it stylish and slim.Sound: Not many people rate the stock sound because if they buy a TV this nice they use something higher end for that. But I haven't done that yet so I'm making due. I'm happy to report that the sound is head and shoulders above the other TVs out there. So good marks there if that's something you're going to use.Remote/Menu/Web/Phone app: The remote is okay. The buttons feel clunky and older, but they get the job done. There is a backlight but it leaves out some of the more important buttons like pause and play. Grr. The menu for choosing the different apps is decent. I think they tried to make it seem very interactive and 3D but it came across corny. There is a very annoying button-press beep on by default which can be turned off in the options. The phone app running off my Galaxy S2 was laggy. I would never actually use so I throw it in the gimmick folder.Packaging: Comes packaged quite well. Decent instructions on installing the base front and center but a lackluster manual.Final: I'm thrilled with this TV. I tried to think of any flaw I could and as you can see there aren't many serious offenses to report. If you're on the fence about what to buy I hope this helps lean you this way because you really can't go wrong here. I spent the last 3 months very frustrated with the TVs I bought/returned. I finally get the throw away the box. That's quite an endorsement. Just remember to disable the smoothing. It's set to \"weak\" by default but you'll still get the jitters and that \"live TV\" look.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Viera P60ST50", "Author": "M. Jacobs \"audiophile\"", "ReviewID": "R1UOES9DD622DH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll keep this review short and sweet, unlike some of my other reviews. I have only had this TV for a few weeks now and I must say the picture quality (PQ) blows away every other display I have ever seen. I have read other reviews mentioning the old Pioneer Plasmas and some brought up the Samsung line but I never really got caught up in the plasma world when those manufacturers reigned supreme. As far as modern-day HD is concerned, I believe the best technology is plasma and Panasonic has the best models available-period. I'm not saying plasma displays are without quirks and issues. There is always a concern about image retention (IR) and screen burn-in if you are not careful. And I recommend following the advice of experts when it comes to breaking in a new plasma display. Yes, that means setting up your brand-spanking new TV and watching a seemingly never ending slide show of colors for 100 hours. Yes, that's 4 days of semi-torture that you must endure if you want the best PQ and the most consistently beautiful display for years to come. Plus, during the prep you can observe the display for defects.Check out Hi-Def Junkies, D-Nice is a great, albeit persnickety video calibration expert over there: [...]As for the ST50s menus and such, you might find navigating through everything a bit daunting at first. The quick start guide was infinitely more help than the \"manual\" supplied. The on screen help is readily available from a single button on the remote. The network setup is very straightforward and the Viera connect works well with windows computers for media sharing. It will connect to your wireless network on the 5MHz (N) band, so this will ease your traffic on the crowded 2.4 GHz band. At least you won't have to share bandwidth with the microwave ovens and alarm clocks in your house.I didn't say much about the PQ, but suffice it to say you need to see a Panny Plasma for yourself before you go and spend your money on an LCD or LED or OLED unit. The extremely wide viewing angle of Plasmas cannot be beat. The 3D on this TV is simply mind-boggling. One thing you must consider is your room lighting. Plasmas work best in darkened rooms. Invest in shades or curtains if you have to-don't let that be a show stopper (literally). I forgot to mention, after the 100 hour prep for the panel you either should get it professionally calibrated or get the Disney WOW disc and do it yourself. You will not be disappointed.In conclusion, I must say I realize Plasma displays are not for everyone. They require some setup and prep time and if you have screaming kids ready to watch a Tele-Tubbies marathon, how can you let it run a slide show for 4 solid days non-stop? And if you are a retro junkie and you break out the old pong game during a party with your former college roommates you risk burning an image into your display that will last far longer than your hangover. So yes, there are a few concerns you must consider. If you can get past the initial prep time you will be rewarded with a fantastic picture that will satisfy for years to come (panel loses 1/2 brightness after 100,000 hours according to Panny). So far I am extremely happy with this unit. I hope my rambling review (RR) will help you make an informed decision on whether or not a plasma tv is right for you.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture", "Author": "KidHorn", "ReviewID": "RSLLN3YWMG8JL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the 60st50. The picture is stunning. Blacks look really good. I own an older 50gt15. Which was their 50\" GT model from 2009. I thought it looked excellent. The newer models look much better. The picture is jaw droppingly good in a normal household setting. Not a brightly lit Best Buy. Much better than any LED/LCD.I have an 11.2 sound system, so I don't use the built in speakers and don't care how they sound.I don't used the internet apps since a laptop is much better at doing anything on the internet than any TV. They're fun to play with, but day in day out, you're much better off using a computer. Who wants to look at youtube on a tv of this caliber. It's like buying a lamborgini and complaining about how it handles in city driving. I use the TV for true high def content and only that (blu-ray and FIOS). Not crappy looking netflix streaming that people think is HD, but isn't.I think 3D looks great. I have 2 pairs of the better panasonic glasses that cost around $55 each (For the wife and I) and 3 pairs of the samsung glasses that cost under $20 each (for the kids). All glasses work great. My wife, who never cares about technology, asks me to get more 3D movie rentals.My TV faces east, so in the morning there's some glare. It doesn't handle it great. No TV does. Every TV will have a bright spot where a bright windows reflects off it. Some more than others. If it bothers you, it will bother you no matter how good the TV is at attempting to shine through it. I have curtains that I can close that completely eliminates any glare.Burn in hasn't been an issue. I purposely have not allowed my kids to hook up a gaming system. They can use our older HDTV's for games. They don't seem to care. Even on our older panasonic plasma, we had image retention from games being on all day, but never burn in. You could see the image with the tv off if you looked closely, but never noticed anything watching normal TV shows. The retention always went away after a while.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed - TV problems in 6 months time", "Author": "Maximus", "ReviewID": "R2DQYSB74YSG34", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying I have a 4 year old 50 inch Panasonic Plasma that I really like and have had no problems with.  But this 60 inch ST50 that I ordered in May 2012, has recently turned into a big disappointment.  I really liked it the first 6 months we had it.  The picture is outstanding.  However late September the TV started turning itself off and the blinking red lights on the power indicator started.  Usually, I could just unplug it, wait a few mintutes and plug it back in and it would come back on.  Well about 3 weeks ago, it did this, and now nothing.  Won't come back on, no flashing lights, just completly dead.  I called customer service and they put me in contact with a local repair shop that does warranty repair for Panasonic.  From my description of what happened, they said the power board must be bad, and they were going to order a new part.  She called back a day later, and said that the part is backordered from Panasonic.  A few days ago, I called back, and the part is still listed as unavailable, and Panasonic does not know when the part will be available.  This has been 3 weeks that this TV has been down.  That is unacceptable to me.  If it was my only TV, I would really be screwed.  It sounds like this might be a problem that is not uncommon.  If they have been having this problem, they should have been making plenty of these parts.  I am just very disappointed in Panasonic.  I had been a huge fan of theirs and had been recommending this TV to friends and family.  But now I don't know.  I will update this as the situation unfolds.Update: November 2, 2012 - Well the repair technician was out yesterday with a new \"A Board\".  And low and behold, it was not the A Board that was the problem.  He now says it is the \"P\" board which he now has to order.  If this one is backordered it may be another 2+ weeks.  Happiness meter is going down further.Update: November 20, 2012 - The \"P\" board was installed about a week ago.  The TV is now working again.  I really do enjoy watching this TV, overall I believe this is a great TV at a really good price.  I upgraded the review to 4 stars.  I can not give it 5 stars, because obviously there are some \"board\" issues going on with some of the TV's.  It probably it not going to be a problem with most people's TV, but there are a few of us out there that got faulty boards that caused the thing to go dead.  Panasonic did make it right, and although it took awhile because of parts being backordered, bottom line is the TV is fixed and working great now.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding HDTV", "Author": "Johnnie B", "ReviewID": "R3UX55AO8HJODW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a Samsung PN59D7000 owner who helped a family member on a recent purchase to upgrade their TV from a 42\" Toshiba LCD.  Like many shoppers, they wanted the best picture quality for the money.  They asked for my help knowing that I spent some time researching before my Samsung purchase last year.  They were considering a LED because they looked great in stores compared to plasmas but I quickly steered them away from that.  With some thorough search, I helped them choose the P60ST50.  I'm not a fan of purchasing electronics soon after their release as prices are expected to drop but the value of this TV beat the best of 2011 TV's including the Samsung I own for sale currently.First, I am very pleased with my Samsung.  It's got its little quibbles like brightness pops and faint buzzing that most plasmas will exhibit but the picture is great and the price was right.  It's strong suits are the incredibly accurate color presentation, deep black levels and strong video processing.  The 3D display, though I don't use it much, is very good with minimal ghosting and cross-talk.  Equipped with an excellent suite of online apps, sans Amazon Instant.  Designed beautifully that really stands out as the centerpiece of our entertainment center.That said, it's a wonder how much one year makes.  Panasonic's mid-tier ST50 beats my TV, second highest tier of Samsung's plasma lineup last year.  I've been looking at their new Panasonic off and on for the last month and I noted a few differences between the P60ST50 and the PN59D7000.I won't write a fully detailed review that I usually do because I don't own this TV but I can tell that the ST50 is superior:It has slightly better blacks.  It's subtle but still discernable with the naked eye.  I can't believe you can now find an affordable TV of this size with this level of black.Color is excellent.  Read that it isn't as accurate as my Samsung but it's very hard to tell with the naked eye after dialing in the pictures.  Colors do \"pop\" like my display.Shadow detail is slightly better on this TV.  This one was very hard to tell also but I think there is a slightly more dark scene detail than mine.  Perhaps that's due to the slightly better blacks.Bright picture for a plasma.  It can be tuned to a bright picture, almost on LCD level.  This is important to the purchasers as they have this in their living room.  If you plan on getting a plasma for a room with some natural light, consider this TV.  We also looked at the Samsung E6500 but it didn't seem very bright.  My TV is bright.  I don't know if the new Samsungs are tuned down on purpose or not.Great set of features like wifi, the important suite of online stuff including Amazon Instant which my TV does not have.3D display is very good.  Again, read that the Samsung does a better job but I couldn't tell using my Shrek 3D Bluray.  Perhaps there was more noise in the Panny's display but couln't pick it up with my eyes and I've seen some LCDs with terrible 3D display.  The ST50 also came with 3D glasses unlike my TV.No brightness pops.  I'm hoping Samsung comes out with a firmware fix soon for my TV.  Been waiting awhile.  It doesn't bother me so much but it's one of things that seem very fixable.  The ST50 didn't show any of the brightness pop effect.Buzzing was faint.  Like most plasmas, there is a slight buzz especially in bright scenes.  The phosphors are firing hard and makes a slight buzz.  Many people complain about this but it is so slight and it is inherent in the plasma technology that I can dismiss it.  The ST50's buzz is a bit more muted than my Samsung.  Of course if the set is constantly buzzing or if buzzes loud enough to overtake the speakers then there is a problem.Ambient light handling is great.  It has these new louvered filters to help with reflections.  Again, with this TV in the living room with some natural lighting, it is an important feature.  Does a great job at it like my TV does.  I cannot tell which does a better job but read that the ST50 does.  From what I can tell it's pretty close.This is an excellent TV.  It costs less than what I paid last year for my TV at year end discount and still gives a overall better picture.  We looked at the PN60E6500, which we almost bought bc it is $200 cheaper and has a great picture but still preferred the brightness of the ST50.  We debated on if the brightness was worth $200... until the sales guy brought the price down $150 on the ST50.

So my review will be based around the differences I noticed between my old LCD and the ST50.Pros:1. Image reproduction is all around amazing.  Black levels are deep and the contrast is amazing.2. When playing games (Consoles and PC) that are 60 FPS, the ST50 handles the motion like a champ with no blur in my eyes.3. It upscales 720p very well.  I couldn't tell the difference between the Xbox 360 1080p upscaling and the TV's upscaling to 1080p.4. Input lag isn't noticeable even outside of game mode.Cons:1. Dithering (a crawling kind of pattern) can be noticeable from even 6-8 feet away depending on what's on the screen.2. There's a slight band on the far left of the screen (your right).  But this isn't noticeable during normal viewing.3. Motion is very jarring when playing games that are 30 FPS and there is panning/rotation around the scene.  The TV seems to alternate between game frames presenting a \"double image.\"  I understand(I've read...) this is what plasmas typically do with 30 FPS.  But it really is annoying especially in RPGs when you rotate the camera.  Turning on motion smoothing can slightly help, but that introduces artifacts and weird looking motion.Semi-cons:1. Buzzes when pushing brighter pixels.  But I have not once noticed it when playing games or watching movies.  So this really isn't a big deal.2. I had a tiny case of image retention after playing Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 for about 2 hours.  Pieces of the life bar stayed on the screen.  I couldn't see it from about 6 feet away, but I was able to slightly make out the pattern when I got really close to the TV.  After watching a movie for an hour, it went away completely.Overall I'm happy with it as the picture quality is amazing.  It certainly isn't a perfect TV as no TV is.EDIT: So I was messing with the contrast on a gray picture and I'm seeing logos from programming from over a year ago.

Honestly, after a while one can really over think/over research a purchase so at some point your just gonna want to be done and buy one.The picture quality on the TV is Amazing. Yes it is a little (really just a little) on the darker side (I'm using CNET settings) but I think people are confusing shadow detail and depth to being dark. Of course if you bring up the brightness to 100 it will get brighter but you loose a great amount of detail. Please please please don't use that \"Vivid\" setting.

After extensive research on Amazon, home theatre websites, and suggestions from store representatives, I purchased this TV.Before continuing, one note to pay attention to- this TV when first purchased has a bad tendency to burn in images. Upon turning on this TV I ran color slides for around 95 hours (which is still under the recommended amount of 200, but better then nothing).Even after this amount of time, playing a video game with static content (Call of Duty 3, for example) left images on the screen for around an hour.After quite some time, and more color slides, the TV burned in slightly less, but still suffers from this problem.Anyway, onto the positive.Starting with Image...1. Black Level: Fantastic. The black level on this TV is adjustable through both the simple, easy user settings and the professional settings, with many different levels. I found the stock black level to be very good, though the TV required some contrast and \"Black Level Deepness\" adjustments. For movies such as The Dark Knight and Inception, many scenes do look slightly dark, though my TV still has to be professionally calibrated, so this is not a negative aspect.2. Brightness: Good. Upon viewing this TV in the store, I had noticed the brightness is substantially lower then that of the competitors. This can be both good and bad, depending on the setting. For me, with a Home Theatre setting, this ended up being good, as the lighting in the room is minimal, so it doesn't effect the set. The brightness isn't lacking in this set, per se, but it definitely could be a lot higher. One thing to note is that the white on this TV is very clean (artifact-free, and crisp), if set correctly.3. Glass: The TV has a glass overlay on the screen. Personally coming from a set with no overlay, this is slightly annoying, due to reflections. Again, this relates to the setting the TV is in. The reflections are not too troublesome, though they do exist to a point, which is something to consider.4. Speakers: The speakers in the TV are surprisingly good. The bass is actually quite improved over the TV's of only a few years ago; it features multiple speakers in a row on the bottom back of the set (the term for this slips my mind at the moment, sorry!)5. Inputs: The TV has more then enough inputs. Not much to say about this.6. Sharpness (Overall): The quality of images is.. ridiculously good. Images are sharper then ever (especially with BluRay), and motion looks fantastic. As a user which favors dark movies, this television is fantastic for the price, and there is no set better in my personal opinion (aside from the Kuro series, which cannot be compared for the money).Overall, this television does not disappoint in image quality, black levels, inputs, or sharpness, especially with 1080P content (yes, i'd make a bluray player a requirement if owning this TV).One thing to note though, is if you are purchasing this TV, to run color slides (google it) for at least 200 hours (it doesn't have to be 200h straight), to prevent burn in. I know it's disappointing to have to do this straight out of the box, but in the future you'll be happy you did this.Also, if power consumption is an issue, this TV is *not* energy star qualified, likely because it's meant more for performance (and it's plasma).Overall rating (out of 10): 10.**Just a note***: Each TV is unique, whether the same model or not, so calibration settings that worked for someone else may not work for you. And as some users report, buzzing is an issue with this TV. After running the slides for even 90 hours or so, the buzzing stopped, so it's just a break-in thing.Good luck!", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "60 inch Nice Picture!, but you have to adjust it RIGHT!", "Author": "Bob \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "RJ9TTRKHZSN8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was to scared to go with a led tv with all of the bad reviews about light bleeding in from the egdes, that's terrible for a new tv.

With these settings you don't have to worry about the picture being dark.Picture menuPicture mode: CustomContrast: +100Brightness: +50Color: +60Tint: 0Sharpness: 0Color temp: Warm 2Color mgmt: Off [grayed out]C.A.T.S.: OffVideo NR: Off-- Pro settings submenuColor space: NormalW/B high R: +10W/B high G: 0W/B high B: +3W/B low R: +4W/B low G: 0W/B low B: -2Black extension: 0Gamma adjustment: 2.6Panel brightness: High (Very Important!)Contour emphasis: OffAGC: 0-- Aspect adjustments submenuScreen format: FullHD size: Size 2H size: [grayed out]Zoom adjustments: [grayed out]-- HDMI settings: [no change from default]--Advanced picture submenu3D Y/C filter: Off [grayed out]Color matrix: HD [grayed out]Block NR: Off [grayed out]Mosquito NR: OffMotion smoother: OffBlack level: Light3:2 pulldown: On24p Direct in: 60HzThese settings will really bring your plasma to life.

You can watch the pictures and video's straight from your phone with no downloading, really Cool! Also a basic remote too.

Helps to calibrate.", "Author": "BJP in SC", "ReviewID": "R11R64186EBO8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to upgrade my living room TC-P50ST30 (older model line), which moved into the bedroom. Having been so pleased with the performance of that Panasonic plasma it was a no-brainer to revisit the line when it was time to go bigger. I'm happy to report this one is even better.While I have not performed any strict, same-source comparisons between the two, the ST50 seems to have an even livelier, crisper picture than the already-fine ST30. You'll be impressed with the deep blacks, wide viewing angle, and strong color reproduction of this panel. Caveat: the picture is only as good as the source material you feed it. In fact, as I'd say is common with most high-grade TVs, it's so good that it exposes flaws in material that poorer TVs (notably, SDTVs) would cover up. For example, some DVDs may actually look blurrier, or grainier, on your big fancy HDTV than they used to. That's because the display actually shows you the limitations of DVD (480p) picture quality. And don't be surprised if you find yourself cursing the cable company for compressing the h-e-double-hockey-sticks out of its feed, manifested in obnoxious blocky artifacts or bad gradient banding, especially during bursts of fast motion (like, I don't know, sports) -- this isn't your TV's fault, it's your lousy cable provider's. The best way to really see how great the picture is is with a quality Bluray -- and even then, you'll see the film the way the filmmaker wanted you to. Did you know that some films are intentionally shot to be grainier, or softer, or with odd contrast or color balance? Your Panasonic plasma TV will show you all of that.So, is this some kind of miracle reference display or is there anything at all bad about it? Well, a little more on that below but picture-wise, here's one: As is typical of plasmas, the glossy surface doesn't do so well with reflected light (think MacBook/iMac/Apple display), but I do little enough daytime viewing that it's hardly an issue.Others have done their part to debunk many of the remaining misconceptions that still carry over from the earlier days of the plasma-vs.-LCD/LED debate (Side question: has this issue ever brought people to fisticuffs? If so, it may well have been a first for the kind of person prone to such provocation.), but it'll rehash that for the benefit of those just now diving into research on the matter. (1) Plasmas draw way more power: In this day and age, technically still the case but not really a big deal anymore. Suffice it to say, this TV came with the familiar Energy Star annual-power-cost estimate sticker, and it was insignificant enough that I summarily forgot what it said moments after throwing it out. (2) Plasmas aren't as bright as LCD/LED: True on a theoretical level. But if it tells you anything, I keep my panel brightness on the \"mid\" setting and have no issue with brightness. (3) Plasmas suffer from image burn-in: Again, this was a bigger problem during a bygone era. Your panel will have a screen-saver mode, and in general it's just not good habit anyway to leave something paused up on the screen for hours on end. Whether you are watching late-night Cinemax or not. (I mean really, hours?) These days, you'd have to try hard or just be extra negligent to burn an image into your panel. And often that which does get retained will fade with time. (Sorry, Cinemax pausers.) (4) Plasmas are old technology: Actually not true. It only seems that way because the earlier wave of big-screen HDTVs were plasmas; that's because LCD technology hadn't yet been applied to the large screen sizes that TVs require. But in fact, LCD display technology itself has been around for decades. So the big LCD TVs that seem \"newer\" or \"more cutting-edge\" than plasma are simply LCD catching up with TV size needs. Side note -- as for LED, this seems newfangled, but it's actually still LCD technology; the LED part simply refers to the way in which the liquid crystals are backlit in the display itself.Now, all of the above is not to denigrate LCD/LED technology or those who prefer it. I myself have only ever owned plasma TVs, so I make no representation of direct, thorough personal experience from a comparison standpoint. I just point the preceeding facts out to clear up any confusion or concern people may have going into this decision. Though I'll be glad to take it outside with anyone who has a problem with what I've written.While I was typing this I just had what appeared to be a baby roach crawl inside the keyboard of my laptop. How ridiculous is that. Excuse me while I attempt to crush it. qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqGetting to the second half of the title of my review: Strongly consider making adjustments to the display settings for optimum performance. These modern panels are exceedingly customizable (I never used to fiddle with my CRTV settings), and you should take advantage of that. Do a search for D-Nice's calibration settings and break-in procedure: You'll find out how to properly age your panel for even pixel performance (agonizing while you're waiting the 100 hours but according to The Internet it's worth it) and a starting point for what to adjust your settings to. I did this with my older Panasonic and also this one, and in both cases I further tweaked the settings to get the best-looking picture based on my own viewing environment. Do the same and you'll be glad you did.I haven't even mentioned the various \"smart features\" of this TV yet. That's because I basically don't use them. I bought this with some fairly simple criteria in mind: picture quality, inputs, and value. As to the first, I addressed that above. As for the second, this has 3 HDMIs and one component hookup. The HDMIs are used for Apple TV, Bluray and a free cable with a laptop display-out adapter on the other end. Component is used for my cable box, which actually works out because HDMI confuses the box into frequently throwing out a standard-def picture. Have you ever tried to watch \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" in SD on a big HDTV? Do not attempt this. You'll miss all the nuance. On the inputs side, my only complaint with this model vs. my other Panasonic is that they've combined component video and the older, single yellow video input into one jack. The TV actually comes with an adapter that you plug all your component cables into, which combines into a single male RCA plug. This means that I can't leave my Wii connected to the TV via its video out cable; I have to unplug the cable box to switch over. I realize this is like complaining about the first iMac not having serial ports, but the Wii isn't that old and I still use it once in a blue moon. (\"Blue moon\" = I'm drunk and want to play Boom Blox.) On the matter of value, I spent a while researching different TVs before buying the first Panasonic, and the fairly confident conclusion I came to was that you couldn't find a better combination of picture quality with affordability. I bought the 50\" for about $1,000, and the 60\" for $1,700 in December 2012. I see now it's selling for $1,300. Such is the way of things with TVs -- they are getting better and cheaper. Every new day is an even better time to buy an HDTV. (Don't think about that last sentence too hard or you'll never buy a TV. In fact, just forget I said anything.)Holy sigma-helvetica-iodine-tango, that roach just emerged. This explains what's been eating up my hard drive space. agkeklntvkn. There, I think I got him.So about those \"smart features\" I still didn't talk about yet. This TV is 3D-ready, though I've never used this feature and have no intentions to. Basically this feature just happened to come with the TV I wanted. If I wanted to see things in 3D, I'd turn off the television and walk outside. And come on, who wants to do that? This TV can get on your WiFi network, which is handy if you don't have some other device that can do the same. But who doesn't? (Hint: poor people who can only afford a 60\" TV and no peripherals.) I use Apple TV for Netflix, and if I bothered with Amazon Prime Video, I'd use my Bluray player since it connects to the audio system. I'm not even sure what other internet features this TV has -- Facebook? Not on it and anyway that's ridiculous. Pandora? I have other means (Apple devices) of sending that to the audio system. News and weather? Didn't use those channels on the Wii and I don't need them baked into a TV. SD card slot? You can do photos and video and all that over WiFi; in my case, Apple TV via the computer. Ditto for the USB slot, although I did use this at the very onset to run the panel break-in slides. Since then, no plans. But your mileage may vary.tl;dr version: Panasonic has improved upon their already-solid line of mid-tier plasma panels, with great picture quality, very few drawbacks, plenty of features you may not even need, all at an attractive price.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome picture, and looks great too", "Author": "Netdealz", "ReviewID": "R1SPNZRP6XRDZZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a lot of research, comparison between LED and plasma, decided to take the plunge.

A 5 minute call to Panasonic customer service fixed the issue (changed the DNS settings).2 things that are a little \"annoying\" is that the TV does not support HBO Go streaming service.  The app is not available on the platform. Secondly, when the TV is off, the screen appears to be a shade of blue (I would have expected it to be black).

People walk into our living room and they just say wow- it really looks awesome. The ST50 model is the cheapest of the higher end Panasonic models(GT50 and VT50 being the higher ones), but it doesn't look cheap at all. Colors are bright and accurate and football looks great on this beast. If you are trying to decide between the GT50 and the ST50 and will be using custom settings as recommended, get this TV. The picture quality will be identical and you will save a few hundred bucks. The VT50 has a better panel that is supposed to have better blacks, but the blacks on the ST50 are already amazing, so I definitely wouldn't spend the extra money on that one.I've not seen any signs of IR (IR is image retention - an image is temporarily \"burned\" onto the screen, but fades after a short period of time). I am somewhat careful in that I make sure not to have static images on the screen too long (say from games for example) and I'd recommend being careful about that for the first like 400 hours or so. \"Young\" plasma is more prone to stuff like IR. In a way, the longer you have the plasma, the better it gets!Sound quality - I can't comment because I have surround sound setup, but I would never recommend someone use TV speakers at this price point. If you want to truly enjoy your viewing experience, buy some surround speakers and a receiver... honestly any will be better than the built-in speakers.Buzz? What? - Yes, many/most/all Panasonic plasmas have buzz with bright white images on the screen. I'm not sure if all brand of plasmas have the buzz, but I would be inclined to think so. It is something that does fades over time and may not even be that noticeable, but it's something to be aware of. To me it's only noticeable on silent scenes/images with bright white. If there is any audio at all, I don't hear any buzz.Just for your info:My model was the November-2 model, meaning it was made in November and is Revision 2.*I highly recommend using custom settings and tweaking to your needs.

I settled on 60\" because it gave good value regarding size and price. I went to a certain popular electronics chain store to see an ST50 in person and witnessed its deep blacks and ease of use. I thought I might go bigger or at least go fancier, such as the 8000-series LED/Plasma Samsungs. I came to my senses after realizing my TV watching habits involved turning the thing on after a long day and not messing with it at all, just hitting play and enjoying some quality programming. I wanted a great \"set-it and forget-it\" TV. This fit the bill perfectly and continues to 2 months after purchase.I've had the TV since the end of August. I have way over 100 hours on it and I feel it's appropriately broken in. I'm not a pro-reviewer or pro TV watcher, if that's a thing :). Important parts:1. No issues with IR (image retention). Zero. Early on in ownership I would make sure to not have any static images left for too long (might play games for a half hour then change to something else) and never have static black bars around the edges such as watching a low-def TV series that doesn't fill the whole screen. The TV has ways of getting around the black bars by changing the \"format\" as the channel changer says. You can zoom or 'fill' the picture to fit whatever you're watching to the screen. I would also not use bright TV modes. I set it to \"standard\" mode on day 1 and have only raised the contrast a bit. My room has slight window glare and is dimly lighted.2. Buzzing. I have had issues with buzzing...unfortunately. It's most noticeable for example if I'm watching a 480i video, not high-def, and something bright is being shown. A candle, the sun, etc. A very standard TV buzz sound emits from the screen. It's annoying. If I crank the volume above a quiet, night-time volume I normally use it's not noticeable, which may give you an idea of how loud the buzz is. It's not too loud, but noticeable nonetheless at quiet TV volumes or at any volume if there's no audio coming from the video to hide the buzz noise. I sit approximately 9 feet from the TV set.3. Gaming (Xbox 360, PS3) is beautiful.4. 3D is amazing. Including 3D gaming. (3D glasses aren't included, I bought the Samsungs other reviewers did as well).5. Using the P60ST50 as a PC monitor works fine. I had to adjust settings on the PC so it didn't leave black space around the edges. It fits great now and has minimal motion lag. PC gaming shows some lag, but works well enough. I'm not a competitive gamer.6. I use the DLNA server mode frequently. I stream music and video with only minimal issues using serviio.

I went to the big box stores to compare, read professional reviews, and customer reviews. My biggest concern was lighting. My living room has a lot of windows and my old DLP TV was so hard to see during the day. I wanted something bright enough to compensate for this. From all of the reviews, I really wanted to buy the Plasma, but was concerned about it looking washed out and hard to see during the day. On the other hand, most of the professional reviewers judged the Plasma to have better picture quality. In the end I elected to purchase the Plasma. The purchasing and deliver experience from Amazon could not have been better. Amazon was actually able to beat Best Buys' price, and could also deliver it quicker than Best Buy could get it to me from their warehouse 10 miles away. For the first month of viewing this TV I was ecstatic. The picture quality is truly amazing. Issues with the lighting were non-existent. I drove my wife crazy on a daily basis telling her how much I loved this TV. Until....it happened! Image retention! After one month of viewing I noticed down in the right bottom corner of theTV, a big black and white CN. My son loves to watch Cartoon Network. I have tried everything to get rid of it. But after 5 months now it is still there, even though we no longer watch carton network on this TV, to my sons great disappointment. It has taken me several months to accept that this is just how it is going to be. I was prepared to just live with it, until last week after watching my  Chicago Bears get their butts kicked, I notice, after the game a big \"FOX TV\" in the upper right hand corner. To say the least I am highly disappointed in this TV! Many of the professional reviewers, and of course, the sales people at the big box stores all say that \"image retention\" is no longer a problem with plasma TVs. The problem has been fixed, they say. But let me tell you, they are wrong. If I had to to it over again I would definitely purchase the LED, even though the picture quality in my opinion is not as good. It is now difficult to even watch this TV as I am constantly worried about being on the same channel too long.

The picture is great, even on standard definition using default settings.  There's no buzz or display anomalies.I tried a custom setup using a tweaked CNET spec, and it did make the picture brighter and perhaps a bit sharper, but the heat output is a little higher as well.  I'll switch to that custom setting or one of the other built-in options when I want more pop, but for general viewing I'm quite happy with the default, which, by the way, seems to auto-adjust brightness quite well.Unfortunately, I've not purchased Blu-ray player to test the picture via that medium (not sure if it's even necessary when movies are available for download and rental outlets are disappearing).  Nor have I bought glasses and tested the 3-D feature.  So no comments there.My only complaint is a lack of auto picture format.  If I select an HD channel, I have to be sure the TV picture format is set to Full.  If I then switch to a standard def channel, I have to pick up the remote and change the format to Horizontal Fill to get rid of the empty (black) areas on the sides.  I wish the TV had an auto-sense mode where the picture would expand to fill the screen without intervention.  An older Philips LCD we have does this, not sure why this one can't.Last note - I didn't bother with the break-in slides.  I ran them for one day, then lost interest in going through hours of that.  Just watch the TV, it's great.The DecisionI struggled with what to buy for a big screen TV to replace our reliable old Mitsubishi WS-55805.  The 55\" Mitsubishi was about $3500 (wow) when bought and it has been a good TV.  There's still nothing wrong with it and we can't hardly give it away.  But I digress.After viewing LEDs, newer DLPs, and plasmas, you start to get an idea of what you like and don't like.  The LEDs are nice and bright, but the off-angle viewing leaves something to be desired as does the poorer motion performance.  The new Mitsubishi DLPs looked great and are a fantastic bargain, but for our main den I could not bring myself to get a thick, dated-looking technology.  I brushed-off plasma at first because it is less bright, consumes more energy and had a history of image retention (IR).  However, the more I read the more plasma emerged as the top choice due to its picture quality, reduced/eliminated IR problems, and improved brightness.The decision of which plasma to get is difficult, particularly when you can get last year's models for almost half price.  But the prior years reports of plasma \"buzz\", \"green blobs\", peeling screen coatings, etc. convinced me to go with the latest.  The Panasonic 2012 specs/improvements and initial reviews are very good.I really thought I wanted the GT50.  I saw a smaller one demoed and it looked fantastic.  When the 65\" models finally became available, I couldn't bring myself to pay another $700 over the ST, particularly when the ST is supposedly on par or better than the VT30.  The kicker was a recent VT50 review I read that indicated it wasn't that much better than the ST.  With amazon's famous return policy and 14-day price guarantee, I decided to give the ST a go.Deliver and First ImpressionsDelivery was prompt and simple.  I did not know the delivery was \"white glove\", so that was a pleasant surprise.  The delivery guys quickly unboxed the TV, assembled the stand and had it all together to ensure it was working properly.How does the TV look?  I'm no videophile but I'll say I'm impressed.  Out of the box, the picture looks great to me.  The TV has brightness set at a \"Standard\" level by default.  I quickly tried the \"Eco\" mode, but it was a little too dim for daytime (might be okay in a blacked-out room).  But again, the default picture looks great.I was easily able to quickly connect the TV to our wireless internet.  After setting the clock (an \"auto\" mode is available that will set it for you - no more manual resets after a power outage!), the menu makes it easy to download software updates.  The Viera connect apps all appear to work fine, though I couldn't exit the Netflix app (haven't signed up for it, yet) without exiting the Viera tools.  The browser works, but trying to type into it with the regular remote would is futile.  I've downloaded the iPhone remote app and I'll update when I know if that works better.  I will say that the tools and browser response was a little slow - perhaps the GT with its dual core processor would better in this situation.So far, so good.  We use a TV to watch TV and movies, so browser and app features are not that important.RecommendationBased on initial impressions, I give this a thumbs up.

(Blu ray movies and sports viewing were my two priorities.)  Blu ray movies are mind-blowing on this set.  That's all I can say about that.  The 3D also performs very well.  This is our first 3D television and the experience is much, much better than I was expecting.  We always watch 3D over 2D now if given the option.Watching the game on this television is a dream.  I have read of 'brightness fluctuation' issues regarding the ST-50 previously.  There have been no issues along those lines whatsoever.  Our household is located deep in northwest Canuckistan and we watch an absolute ton of hockey (Pacific time zone + Center Ice Package + HDPVR= lots of puck.) and it's been nothing but stellar from day one.  Fluctuations in brightness is a non factor as far as I'm concerned.  We also are big baseball and football fans, (Canadiens, Canucks, Blue Jays, Mariners, & Seahawks.)  but the concerns I've read about seemed more leaned towards hockey viewing.Image retention or 'ghosting'.  There isn't a video game going for 16 hours a day at our place, but we have had no problems of any kind, at any time with retention.As far as bright rooms and screen reflections goes, I think that would be a more personal thing.  And it is a plasma vs LED debate, rather than a ST-50 issue.  We have this tv mounted in a southwest facing room with a few huge windows.  Big blinds and down facing light fixtures deal with reflection well at our place if the television is on during the day time.  Blackout conditions for movie viewing of course.  For us, the tv gets most of its use in the evenings and night time anyway, particularly winter, when it's dark.  On sunny summer evenings who wants to be watching television?  For me, the truly incredible picture quality of the quality plasmas and the more realistic images compared to all but the most expensive LED's far outweighs any reflection issues.  Again, this is just how I feel.If you've settled on getting a plasma for your place and you're willing to spend a little more than a grand, I would pick up a ST-50 without a doubt.

I have enjoyed the TV for about a month now and it is really amazing.  I am comparing this TV to my old Pioneer Kuro.  No TV has been able to stand up to the incredible picture of the kuro in the past but this st50 holds up and even in my opinion out performs the kuro tv.  The 3d effect is good but the high end vt50 is better.  If that is really important to you I would compare the two TVs and see if the extra cost is worth it.  On a side note the Panasonic 3d glasses are a little better then the Samsung glasses.

Ran the slides for 100 hours, adjusted custom video settings and then found it had to be tweaked slightly for more brightness. His calibration settings were for the 55ST50 and  the larger 60ST50 needs a little more tweaking as it was not bright enough.I found the Viera Connect's Media Viewer disappointing when using the side SD and USB inputs to view videos. Although it could see the MP4 video files on the usb device and SD card, it could not play them. Something wrong when the ST50 has difficulty reading MP4's which is today's most common hd video fileThe DLNA networking feature was also similarly flawed in that it could not see the great majority of the MP4 video files on my PC through wifi OR hardwired ethernet.  The files it could play displayed poorly with frequent pixelization, and stuttering.

I'll update if needed at a future time. This is GREAT television with nearly all the bells and whistles. If you like the latest and greatest gimmic like hand gestures and voice command, then look at the Samsung line of LED's. Also if you like an overly bright and yes, sometimes phony artficial look, then look to LED's. But if you already decided plasma is the way to go, this and its sister models is one of the best plasma sets on the market at any price... it is that good.First impressions:As much as you might be tempted do NOT attempt to take this beast out of the carton yourself and attach the stand. It simply is too big and to be honest it really is a three person job. Two to lift the set out of the carton, slide it into the base guides while another person screws in the four bolts securing it to the base. The instructions don't say, the tiny hole in the base goes to the back.One feature of this set is what Panasonic calls \"first time setup\" which is a fully animated seven step how-to of basic connections including hooking up to your WiFi home network. The help on screen of the tv itself is very good. Easily accessible from the remote anytime you need it.The remote has a built-in light that lights up the keys, useful in dark viewing situtations. The menu system is a bit different than some in that the main choices appear on the left, with a sub menu to the right, BUT you need to press OK first in order to access the sub menu features and sometimes step through multiple presses of return. Just takes a little getting use to.Right out of the box, set it set to \"standard\" mode which might be disappointing to some. This as the other modes are easily changes to whatever values you want and will be remember. Many options appear on multiple pages and sometimes not seen unless you press the little down pointing arrow. Too early to say how I'm changing my setting, several have already commented on that.Internet access: Setting up to my WiFi connection was easy and automatic. All you need is your router's name and password and your tv should find and conect to it in a minture or so. The remote keypad will allow you to enter your password, but torture as far as how slow doing it that way is. If you plan on using this set to view the Internet and do more that just pick movies invest in one of the supported optional keyboards.I tried a SD card from my video camera and it flawlessly played as a slideshow without issue. I haven't tried DLNA features to access my other assets on the network yet nor the USB feature.A couple issues you might run into. One depends on your cable box. Mine has a curious option when you have to use the cable remote to go to settings and select between HDMI and Dolby output. If you don't, then the audio output via HDMI was only left and right channel, not Dolby. Simple fix. Also on my A/V receiver I had to change it's settings to ARC-auto otherwise it too would interfer with proper audio playback. The audio output from the TV itself is ok, but just ok. Do yourself a favor and get a A/V receiver to properly playback digital audio. Once you hear the difference, you'll never go back.File under dumb mistakes: In taking away my old TV and disconnecting from my A/V receiver I managed to pull off one wire that went to the center speaker. So, when I first turned on the new tv I was not happy I could only hear muffled background sounds and saw the actors mouths moving but not hearing them. Simple fix. So if something weird happens, check your other equipment before blaming the new tv. (wink)About the picture quality:Jaw dropping. Yeah, that good but only after tinkering with some settings, having a STRONG signal from your signal source, proper ambient room lighting and viewing from a proper distance from the screen. This of course is somewhat a personal choice. One dispute that has been waging forever is there seems to be two camps, those that prefer the more natual look and color saturation of plasmas, and another camp that likes what to most videophile purists seems artfical and cartoonish in \"some\" viewing situations. Only having watched a few hours so far, I feel I made the right choice going with my second plasma. The picture quality especially when viewing full live 1080i content (most cable boxes show in their window what resolution is being broadcast)is outstanding and very crisp without look a bit phony as it can on some LED's.A few quick tips on calibration for the do it yourself crowd:Assumed: You have the ability to download images from the Internet, have a DVD and or Blu Ray burner to make your own disks. Google \"Indian Chief test pattern\". You'll find tons of them. They're suppose to be black and white. Try to find one close to the resolution of your new TV or failing that use some photo enhancement software such as Photoshop to enlarge to 1920 x 1080 or as close to that as possible. Remember to keep aspect ratio in tact otherwise you'll defeat the purpose of this adjustment.Now burn to a DVD (add other test patterns test images if you like, more on a future post). Let set warm up a good 20 minutes, in a semi dark room, load your DVD in. Be careful not to keep the test pattern on screen for more than a couple minutes, it should take way less time. Record your settings. Set color to 0 to remove all color. Now while watching the test pattern slowly adjust the sharpness control to get the best seperation between the lines in the test pattern and the best looking indian with a feather headdress.Many people make the assumption more is better and will crank up sharpeness or focus control to near maximum. Wrong! This is reality will only distort the picture. While observing the test pattern as you adjust setting watch for fuzziness of the lines and also blooming or the lines seeming to grow in size or \"blooming\" a sure sign you have too little or too much sharpness. Once you get the most seperation between the lines in the test pattern without otherwise distorting something else stop, your done. Reset your color control and now you may want to recalibrate your other settings a bit.Doing a grayscale adjustment is just as simple, and no, you don't really need to buy some fancy set up disc to get close to ideal settings. I'll give details in a few days or so after I get around to doing mine.Update #1 9/18Calibration: Did a primary first quick calibration just adjusting settings. A few observations: I've had a plasma set for 8 years, one of the first generation of plasma sets. The one negative thing I observed and it applies to all brands I've seen and trust me I spends hours checking them all out, not just Panasonic, is for reasons unknown the overall brightness level has decreased, (in Plasam sets) supposedly to help give longer life. My older set, which was working fine and donated to a homeless shelter had all the settings mid range, and it still had a brighter overall picture.However the contrast,sharpenss, black levels on the new set are superior. That said, the overall pictue is excellent but for sure like all plasma sets a bit dimmer than LED sets in general, but as others said the colors and overall picture quality while an objective opinion seems superior. While LED sets might have a slight edge for movies, some other things, I assume like me most watch quite a bit of \"regular\" broadcast television both in standard defintion and HD and I find for that the plasma tops the LED most of the time, especially for sports and other fast action playback. But it's opinion and choice.As far as settings you change on the tv, I was quite different that the CNet values or other posters offered, mainly to try to get the picture brighter, as I was used to without getting carried away.Viera Connent: A nice feature, but flawed and annoying on a couple minor points you should be aware of. I just got off the phone with Panasonic support (who were excellent, prompt too on two rings) that confirmed these couple things. One of the big selling points of \"smart\" tv's is their ability to connect you to the greater electronic univese both by directly accessing the Internet (if you have a broadband connection and WiFi/Ethernet connection) and also though the same connections accesss other assets on your home network such a videos, photos and your music collection.How does it work? Actually pretty good! I'll skip reviewing Internet performance since I only tested a few vids playing off Youtube. Worked fine, no skipping. While I haven't set up a NAS (Network attached Storage) device yet, even without it, the TV easily accessed my main PC and allowed me to select media and play it of my new tv.The problems? I have a A/V receiver hooked up to the tv to get better audio playback. While the TV has options to switch between the TV speakers and home theater for some odd reason any video file I played from the DLNA connection was muted. Why? According to tech support it's designed that way. So You need to do a couple menu choices on the remote to switch to tv speakers, then back again when you play tv channels. I say muted since I had my tv set to play in theater mode for the TV which it did without issues after a minor settings change on the cable box remote.Worse there's a option when your done playing your computer files to return to the TV. Well that don't work directly either. It only switches back to ANT input, which is fine if you don't have a home theater and have your cable box or other video source plugged directly into the TV' ANT coax connector, but no good if you have a home theater hooked up via HDMI. You have to go back and selection whatever HDMI source you have you home theater connected too. Again, told this is a \"design feature\", which I hope gets corrected with the next firmware release (if it can be) because there's no reason for it and I assume many buying this expensive of a tv will also opt to have a home theater, so Panasonic dropped the ball on this in my opinion.Remote choices as far as options:Quite good, but a bit curious. You have various picture options and each HDMI imput can be set differently, however what I found annoying was some options like advance settings or Gamma and other things you really want to play with don't appear for all picture mode options. Again annoying because I had the picture really popping set to game mode with brightness and contrast turned down, but wanted to tweak gamma and wasn't allowed... remote just jumped over that menu choice and other modes jumped over other things I wanted to change but wasn't allowed.So sadly all the settings are only truly adjustable on in custom mode. Which itself is a bit annoying (yes I'm nitpicking a bit) because especially when you're new to the set it is very easy to skip over things you can adjust. Something you need to click on the option choice which brings up more offerings, and it is easy to just click the tiny down allow to go to the next page, and you'll never know you missed something. Minor, but again annoying in design.As far as not being able to change anything in any picture mode, In my opinion again a silly restriction. Nothing more frustrating to a techie like me finding a menu option, then wishing to change it and can't because the system won't allow it. While annoying, you can live with it, since you're not going to be playing with settings much once you first set the set up.About hum, heat generated, other \"bad\" things:No hum for me. Nothing, well ok, almost nothing. I do have an audio meter and if in a quite room go to the back of the set it barely registers about 10dB. Hear it from the front of the set with the audio on? No, not at all.Heat generated from the set? Very little, about half as much as my older plasma did. Some reviewers here and elsewhere seem to have made a big deal about this. Again, I don't see it or should I say feel it. Yes, if you put your hand on the vent holes on the back of the set it is warm to the touch, but barely. If you walk up to the screen after it has been on awhile, yes you can sense a bit of heat being thrown off, but again not exteme, not a lot, just a bit and only if you get within inches of the screen which of course you shouldn't anyway. Just for a comparsion, my tv cable box is about twice as hot and yeah,that almost does make you want to pull away, but not this tv.Update #2 9/19For some odd reason I can't respond directly to comments or make comments to what others said, they get rejected. I've told Amazon about this several times and it falls on deaf ears, so my only way to repond to anyone asking questions is to extend my original comments.I'll be happy to post all my settings in a few days, I'm still in fiddle mode myself ;)One thing I've noticed that does make a big impact on image quality and overall brightness while keeping good contrast is the \"pro setting\" adjustment. Try this:Menu/Picture Mode, go to page #2 to gain access to \"pro settings\". Click the little down arrow to go to page #2 of this sub menu. Set black extention to +2. Set Gamma to either 1.8 or 2.0. Panel Brightness to Mid. AGC to +10. Click on \"save as defaults\". Click return button to back out of the sub menues.Now WHY you may want to try this. I like everyone else was a bit disappointed with overall picture brightness, me more so since my old plasma was actually brighter and with the various settings in mid range. Out of the box with the setting set to standard, I was disappointed. Very. Like with most tvs the actual function of the controls and the impact are not fully or clearly explained. So I immediately did what you think would be logical... crank up both brightness and contrast. That helped, some, but in general didn't result in a very good picture.So I began to fiddle. I pushed up both contrast and brightness to near max setting then changed the panel brightness setting to high. It helped, some, but the picture quality suffered greatly. So I restored to the \"mid\" setting, dropped gamma, then slowly stepped down both both brightness and contrast to the high 50's range for brightness and high 60's for contrast and WOW, holy cow, what a stunning picture, especially in a semi-dark room. Now a live broadcast (I was watching my local news broadcast) if broadcast at 1080i was like an open window into some other dimension, I never saw any television have this vivid, this crisp, this sharp a picture with stunning contrast and brightness. The moral of the story feel free to \"fiddle\" but be aware some settings that suggest by their label might help can and do make things far worse.Like I said, this was at 10PM in a semi-dark room. I have the set on now, its a bit past high noon, light is streaming in from two overhead skylights (but it don't squarely hit the screen). Yes, the picture is a bit lighter than as viewed last night, but the settings above it still is a very viewable and still well contrasted picture without changings any settings. I might change another imput to use for daytime viewing, but I don't do that much, and really I don't see a need. One of the preimum channels is playing the original Harry Potter right now and it looks great... at high noon in a quite bright room.Update #3 10/6Been exploring the tv's extended possibilites, and quite pleased. Many have noted they didn't buy this set for its \"smart\" features and probably won't try accessing the Internet off a tv or other things it can do. I suggest you try it, it will be an eye openings and fun expereince. Setting up a home WiFi network these days is quick and painless andyou don't need to be geek to do it. Just buy a wireless router, plug that into your pc wherever you have it, plug you Internet sources into the router and then let the TV find the network, (a painless and quick 30 seconds or so process)and then you can see things like YouTube on a big screen with the audio playing through your home theater if you have that and it is far better than watching on a little computer monitor. Of course there's many other things to explore on the Internet side.I'm really updating this review for this TV's DLNA feature. It is better than expected. I'll keep the technical buzz to a minimum. What this feature allows is for example for you to play almost any multimeda file you have on either your PC or attached NAS or similar mass storage that is also part of your home wireless network. What I did in the past was burn a handful of songs from my extensive music collection to a DVD, then pop that in my DVD player and play them off the TV that way. It works, but this is so much better and faster because through DLNA I have instant access to any song on my PC or NAS, plus the big bonus of having it play through my fancy home theater without needing to burn a CD or DVD.If you use Windows, the tv by iself should find Windows Media player, (through DLNA, you'll see it's icon)and provide files to your TV in three main categories, music, photos, videos. There are a bunch of sub menus so you can sort by album, generes, date, actors, make custom play lists, etc.. If you have 100, 500 or thousands of songs on your computer, they are all instantly available and selectable from your big tv screen, in a few remote button pushes. Nothing to set up. Works equally well for your photo and video collection, however depending on what media player you use, (I think if you have Windows on your PC it automaticlly adds that to to media player list. I don't remember manaully doing it. If you have other media player software or use a fancier box like WD TV live, that's even better with more options. The point is this is a whole new cool way to enjoy your tv when you get bored with what's on or your DVD or Blur Ray collection.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "When Delivered & Plugged In---It just BUZZED!", "Author": "My Life is Just One Drama After Another", "ReviewID": "R1KK8P5HKYEL0S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It got one star because of the inital malfunction..., please read on.We were so excited to get this highly-rated Plasma TV. Our old Mitsibushi had gone sour w/vertical lines (after only 4 years!), so we did our due diligence and scoured the web reading everything we could on which TV offers the best HD picture overall. After reading 20+ reviews.., (WHEW!) we decided on Plasma. We wanted the best nighttime TV viewing. Even during the day, we can draw the curtains to block out our very bright ocean view.When the carrier arrived with the TV, we made sure to have him plug in the TV before he took it completely out of the box (it's really difficult to put it all back together-trust us). The delivery guy (just one guy! Needed two as he was struggling) plugged in the TV and LOUD BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZING came bursting out from the speakers! No picture at all. Bummer! The delivery guy prompting packed it back up and took it back with him. :-(Amazon was terrific in replacing the TV with just one call. The same model was delivered a week later. Thankfully, it turned on and the picture quality was great..., for about two weeks.Then, this 2nd Panasonic 60\" Plasma began to 'distort' images while we were watching a couple of TV shows. (I'll leave notes under that particular purchase as well).We thought our eyes were playing tricks on us. A few TV shows suddenly went to a WIDE format (we didn't change it) and the people and items on the screen began to 'WARP/STRECH/DISTORT'. HD became SD.This can't be happening!We paused the TV and went into our Guest Bdrm to turn on our 42\" Sylvania. We began watching the very same program(s) and NO DISTORTION! Glad to know it wasn't our eyes deceiving us!Again, we called Amazon and they are doing one more \"Exchange\". If there is any more problems with the new Panasonic Plasma, Amazon will get Panasonic involved. (Maybe they made a 'batch' of DEFECTIVE TV's?)I sure hope that \"The Third Times The Charm\" with this next Panasonic Plasma. We'll keep you posted!There's just one thing that still bothers us about the newer TV's. Their AUDIO 'sucks'! It's like they purposely want you to buy \"Sound Bars\" or \"Home Theater Systems\". We don't have money to throw around, so we brought in our simple little stereo and hooked it up. Wow, the sound it fantastic!Panasonic's Plasma TV's sound system is less than satisfactory. Weve hung our TV on a rotating swivel mount & followed Panasonic's instructions for setting up the 'audio'..., but the little speakers are in the back of the TV (near the edges) so the sound 'floats' into the air..., not to our ears. If you stand just beside or a little behind the TV, the sound is really good..., but that makes viewing the TV impossible. LOL!Oops, one other thing. It took a little bit to get used to the BLACKNESS. We've done some 'custom' adjustments in the PICTURE setup to get it a little brighter. However, movies never looked better (less strain on the eyes).Since all the 'issues', we haven't tried out the 3D yet. Good Lord, we hope it works!They give you 3 HDMI hooksups; 4 would be better. Their RCA hookup is not great. But neither were the other TV's were looked at.

The user reviews on Amazon and expert reviews on CNet were spot-on: this is the best TV picture for the money in its class.I hesitated to go with a plasma initially because of burn-in fears, but technology has progressed to the point that really is no longer a concern. Most plasmas, my 60-inch ST50 series included, now have built-in screen savers to prevent this and tools to \"wipe\" any image retention that may occur.The best thing about this TV is no motion blur, especially for sports programming. I regretted buying my 60hz Samsung LCD the minute I watched my first football game and saw the pixelation that occurred when the ball was in motion, but a 120hz refressh rate would have cost hundreds of dollars more. With plasma, motion blur is simply not even an issue.Using recommended picture settings I found online, I am very happy with the color rendition and black levels of my Panasonic. Some reviewers complained the screen was a bit \"gray\" when the TV was off, but who watches a TV when it's off?The remote is well-designed and has a back light, but can't say much else about it because I use my Harmony One universal remote most of the time.I watched Avatar in 3D, and I swear it was almost as good as seeing it in the theater in 3D Imax. I didn't really buy this TV for 3D viewing, but I got a 3D BD player so I'd be ready when the studios produce some more decent content.On the \"con\" side, there is a bit more glare with the plasma's glass screen, but the trade-off is better angle views. The screen also gets pretty hot, and I'm sure this TV uses more power, but I can just ride my bike more instead of driving if I ever feel the onset of any \"carbon guilt.\"The built-in speakers are crap, but if you have this much TV, you're gonna have a decent home theater setup for audio anyway, right?Only three HDMI inputs? I haven't missed the extra one yet. I have plenty of inputs for my Panasonic BDT300 3D Bluray and Apple TV.The worst thing is the inability to find the dang 3D glasses that go with this TV. They went off the market completely for a while and only recently became available again. No sign of prices coming down, either. Still at least $80/pr. even at B&H; and Amazon. Panny didn't even reduce their price in their recent Father's Day sale offering. Luckily, the 3Active models work just fine, come with better accessories (nice case, USB cord and cleaning cloth), and cost only $50 each.

That tv is running great with 16 hours a day running time and has a stunning picture.  Couldn't imagine anything better.  When a 60 inch came up for this price with a cnet best buy editors choice I couldn't pass up.  Off went the 50 inch to my sons bedroom.  Yeah, he's spoiled!  The 60ST50 came quickly with box in perfect condition and great professional delivery personnel.  Holy crap!  The picture takes my breath away.  Clean and crisp! I hear not a bit of buzzing even up close.  I use custom picture setting with contrast at 80, brightness at 54 although some use 45, color at 56 and sharpness at 35 even though many recommendations I see are at 0.  Warm 2, CATS and Video NR at 0.  Pro sttings +1, 0, +2, +12, 0, +4.  The blacks are amazing and with picture brightness set lower brings the black out more.  Dark rooms are best, but the picture is so great you learn to tune out any glare.  Only my bright flourescent light in the kitchen is noticable.  The filter does pretty well.  Often people pass up plasmas because the LCD's and LED's next to them in the store are set to Vivid which gives the appearance of a muted picture on the plasma.  Plasma's pictures are superior as you are looking at true to life colors versus glaring animated looking pictures you get from LCD's.  I look around my room while watching TV or a Blu-ray, and the colors on the Panasonic Plasma's are true to the colors of the room.  Watching feels like an extension of the room, not a screen.  I see every detail in a face.  Eye colors pop, and and the motion is really clear.  Watching sports, I see the football not a skipping stone thrown across the field with a tail attached to it.  You won't find that in an LCD for the money if at all.  The 3D is very enjoyable with well fitting glasses if you choose to purchase them.  The interface is easy to use, setting up the 3D and wifi is a snap.  I bought mine for $1499 on a great sale, but easy pay full price for this TV.  Aesthetically beautiful TV.  All I see is the screen. Inputs may be lacking for some, but with a TV this great I highly recommend you use the savings for a receiver and surround sound system with HDMI passthrough.

Best Buy employees tell me it's the best TV they have and praise me for being a Plasma user.  I got a better price with Amazon.  Reasons...  Bang for your buck.  Superb picture quality that surpasses my top of the line 4 year old Panasonic THX and Panasonic durability. One example... I owned a Samsung LCD before the old Panny(sonic).  My son broke it with a tinker toy.  Shattered the pixels on the LCD screen. What a heart breaker!  I nearly got sick! We got the old Panny plasma for a replacement and immediately noticed the difference in picture. Imagine this new ST50 picture that blows it away!  The Old Panny took a forceful flying Wii remote to the face from 3 feet and not a scratch.  Priceless!  Panny's are known for their burn in protection technology over any other Plasma. Get one before they are gone.Edited. 12/22/2012  Important... use slides or a 200 hour break in on 50% contrast/picture and brightness levels.  Do not leave any static images ie USA, Discovery or TNT logos on.  Use the zoom aspect ratio for the first 200 hour break in period to hide the logos.  Especially for marathons or if you might fall asleep.  If on a channel for a long time use the scroll bar located in menu- settings- anti-image scrolbar.  Do some research into taking care of your plasma during it's infancy.

I am extremely happy with my decision.  I had read other glowing reviews for this TV from both Amazon and Cnet, so naturally I focused my TV search around this TV.  I must say that looking at this TV in the store next to some of the other LED LCD TV's is a bit misleading, hence the purchase/return of the Sony HX750.  What I mean by this is that in my store visits, I kept drawing my focus towards the extremely bright LED LCD TV's, as the plasma looked too dark.  The reason I ended up going to the Panasonic instead of the brighter LED LCD is that upon further review the LED LCD did not look natural to me.  Everything looked enhanced and the colors were off even after many attempts at adjusting.  The ST50 has extremely deep black levels and the colors are very natural.  The detail levels on this TV are also better than any TV I have ever seen.  I also like the Smart Viera features and the built in WiFi is a breeze to get going.  For the money, I don't believe there is a better TV on the market.  On a different note, the included power cable is only about 6 feet long. I needed to but a new cable as my outlet was 15' away.  I looked on Amazon but wasn't able to find one.  I eventually found a compatible cable through Monoprice.com.  The TV uses a standard computer power cable and you will want to make sure to get the one that is a right angle.

He says that if he had to do it over again, he would save the $800 (he got his on great sale), and buy the ST50. Yes, the remote on the VT50 is different, but he doesn't go on line enough to pay $800 more for a higher quality remote.I purchased the Panasonic dmp-bdt220 3d Blu-ray player at the same time I purchased the tv and am glad I did. For instance, if I put a dvd into the Panasonic player, my television automatically switches to the dvd input. The player really complements the tv with its quality picture and features.I waited to buy my set until it was priced at $2040, and then a week later Paul's TV had it on sale for $1999, and Amazon did refund the difference when I called them.

I am guessing I am paying for more quality since an equivalent Samsung TV like this is $300 cheaper.On to the review. This TV looks and feels amazing. It took my breath away when I opened the ginormous box. For some reason this 60\" TV looks alot bigger than its brethren. It must be because the trim that goes around the screen is so thin, thus giving the illusion you have more screen space.In the beginning I was just watching HD channels on my cable TV and I was very impressed with the accuracy of colors and vibrance. Yesterday night I finally got a chance to slip in a blueray movie, Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows, and see what this TV can really do. Let me just say this TV blew me away. My mouth literally dropped open and stayed that way for the pretty much the whole course of the movie. The details, the colors, and the 600hz smoothness were literally jaw dropping. The most impressive part was, which Plasma TVs truly excel at, is the clarity of dark/night scenes. You could see every detail in the dark, where LED and LCD TVs fail to deliver excellent picture quality. I just can not put in to words how amazing this Plasma TV looks. If you are in the market for a TV this is the one to get. Plasma doesnt get all the hooplah like LED TVs do but trust me it is worth it. LED is way overrated. If you appreciate picture quality than plasma is the best way to go. I am one of those people that is very picky and always do alot of research and let me tell you I am 200% satisfied.P.S: the built in speakers on this TV are very good.

I am kind of OCD like that. Anyway I finally decided on the Panasonic P65ST50 for multiple reasons.#1 It got great reviews from just about everyplace I looked.#2 I got the ST50 instead of the GT or VT models due to the picture quality being the same. There were some very cool features in the higher end models but really I was looking for size and picture quality as my main objectives and this was at the top of my budget.#3 I decided on the 65 inch model since most of the articles I read stated that the #1 complaint was they wish they had gone bigger. This was the largest plasma TV within my price range. -- Really I could have gotten the 60\" and would have been just fine but finally decided to pony up the extra $600 for the added 5\". Probably not the best financial advice but I am personally happy with my decision. For the most bang for your buck it seems that 40\" or 60\" are your sweet spots since it is only about $200 for each 5 inches from 40\" on.#4 How often do people really buy a TV???? I figure it will likely be 5-10 years before buying a new one. Since it will likely be closer to the 10 year side I wanted the absolute best TV that I could afford.#5 The ST50 is supposed to have less of a glare then UT50 and lower end models.Things I could have done without:- Smart TV -- I have the same thing on my Blue Ray player. I use it only because it is just easier then using the blue ray remote but despite working in the tech industry I am not the greatest at setting up universal remotes.Wish list- I wish the stand swiveled. The higher end models do swivel but I would rather have a 65\" that does not swivel instead of a 60\" that does. -- I have it on a stand and not on the wall. I rent so it makes sense for me.- Blockbuster streaming. -- I have both a netflix and blockbuster account. I wish the TV had blockbuster streaming. Since it doesn't I will be buying a Samsung blue ray or a Roku to get the blockbuster streaming. -- WTH?? I used to just have blockbuster DVD mail server (same as netflix) but my wife kept returning my movies to get chick flicks. Because of this I let her take the blockbuster DVD service and I got Netflix for myself.Surprise bonus- 3D TV. I really didn't want it and would rather have saved a couple hundred bucks if possible to get the TV without it. But since it was not possible I have 3D capability.

I used Amazon warehouse to pick up a great deal on a slightly dented on the rear of the TV.No one knows its there but me and my wife.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best TV I've Owned", "Author": "ReubenET", "ReviewID": "R1KDTL4EJKFGMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first purchased the \"Samsung PN60E6500 60-Inch 1080p 600Hz 3D Slim Plasma HDTV (Black)\" because they were reviewed and priced roughly similar and it came with glasses. That TV died 3 days later and I then bought this Panasonic TC-P60ST50 instead.  I'm now very thankful that the Samsung died, because the Panasonic TV is much, much better.Reasons why:1. Nicer bezel. The Samsung's bezel is an ugly/cheap looking textured brushed chrome. The Panasonic has a nice sleek piano black bezel that looks much more professional.2. Picture quality. Yes, the Panasonic has noticeably better picture quality, and that's really what it's all about, right? Clearer, deeper blacks, etc. Really just better picture quality in every way.3. Better sound. The Panasonic has more/better speakers.4. The Samsung has a terrible, loud buzzing sound (moreso in bright scenes) that's audible when you sit/stand directly in front of the TV. Trust me, it gets very annoying, and should be a deal-breaker for most. The Panasonic is as quiet as a mouse.5. The Panasonic is much thinner than the Samsung.6. The Panasonic's wall-mounting holes are closer together, vertically and horizontally. This means you have many more options for configuring where you screw in your wall bracket versus how you screw the mounting hooks into the TV for the TV to hang where you want on the wall. This is HUGE if you're going to mount the TV.If you're deciding between the Samsung plasma versus the Panasonic plasma, the Panasonic wins hands down. Or even if you're looking for any large-panel TV, this is the best bang-for-the-buck TV you'll find in a 2012 television.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture Quality and Value", "Author": "adg44", "ReviewID": "R27FA33FUNGTUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Usually quality and value are two things that don't go hand in hand. However, in this case, Panasonic was able to deliver. I researched for a while between this and the more expensive GT50 model, and I am glad I went with the ST50. The only benefit of going for the GT50 is for the THX modes, double the shades of gradation, and a dual core processor (which is only for applications, not picture quality). At the time when I purchased the ST50, the GT50 was $600 more for the 60\" model.I will say that I had to exchange my first ST50 for an excessively loud buzzing noise. I called Panasonic to set up a service call, and after getting passed around and finally got a time scheduled, then their subcontractor called me to schedule an appointment, even though I already though I had made one. Turns out the \"appointment\" Panasonic gives you is just an estimate, and the subcontractor who does the repair actually schedules the appointment. I ended up just returning it to Amazon and they sent me another one, and this time there is no loud buzzing.On the first set I just turned it on and used it normally. I didn't do any break in or prep and the picture looked great. On the second set, I decided to do the panel prep and then use the calibration settings posted online (check some highdef forums for this). It looks absolutely amazing and I can't stress the need for a calibration. Just using the standard settings doesn't do this TV justice.With that said, if you are considering an LCD/LED TV, it's a completely different ballgame. This TV has much less brightness (although with window shades it is plenty bright), and the colors doesn't seem artificial or enhanced. Motion is butter smooth and flows naturally. This is the perfect TV for a home theater room, which is exactly how I am using it. It's mated to a Pioneer VSX-1021K running through Polk RTi speakers, so I can't comment on the internal TV speakers, although I'm sure they aren't any better or worse than most other TVs. And finally, regarding burn-in/image retention, I haven't noticed any of that, and even after watching sporting events for a few hours, I don't get any IR. I truly think to get burn in you'll need to leave the same image on the TV screen for days, just like on old CRT monitors.If you are considering a plasma, this is definitely the TV to get, and you'll have some money left over.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far excellent!", "Author": "Kenny Fenton", "ReviewID": "R18SE6ZXAJWYPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently had a nightmare situation with a Samsung Plasma (8000 series) PDP going out for no reason that Samsung would not warranty.

I also bought it through Amazon Wharehouse deals instead of buying a brand new one. I saved 37% and the shipping was free so I only paid 1800 bucks and some change. I sold my LG 55in 3d tv for 800 so it only cost me a thousand to upgrade. Sweeeeet! The only issue I had was with the shipping.  If you try to contact Ceva to schedule a delivery it doesn't go smoothly at times. But, shipping is free so I couldn't really complain.  Out of the box the TV was in immaculate condition so I was confused as to why they sold it so cheap but I was thrilled.  I didn't really notice any scratches or dings or anything and the TV performed like it was new.  The only issue I have had is the USB media player doesn't play large files(over 2gb) that are encoded with MP4/H.264 codec so I had to purchase a ROKU device and that worked.  I have it set on the Cinema setting with slight tweeks and the picture is simply amazing.  The internet content works flawlessly and was easy to set up.  The only issue I have is the 2D-3D feature is pretty much useless.  I had an Lg Cinema 3d that converted 2d content very well and much better.  However, when you watch 3D content Blue Rays or Direct TV it blows away anything I have seen and it is in crystal clear full HD. I bought 2 pair of the glasses and they work well on 48Hz and so far hold a good charge.  You can watch several 3D movies between charges. You will also notice that when 3D content is playing the contrast seems lower on the screen but when you put on the glasses it darkens the levels right back to where you have it set so I actually thought the picture looked better than the Cinema 3d that LG and vizio have.  I also bought the Bose Solo speaker system for 399 bucks and the sound on that is simply amazing. It sounds like a soundbar with good bass and it keeps the volume at one level, I can also understand what people are saying when I have it turned down so I don't wake up the baby.  I had a set of Bose cinemate series 1 which were analog and didn't level the sound before that so I was constantly turning the volume up and down,  I sold those for 250 bucks so it only cost me 150 to upgrade.  Overall, I rate it a 4.5 because of the USB media player issue I have.Updated 11/8/2012...I have had the TV since 9/1/2012 and the TV panel went bad on me the other day.  This is the first TV I have ever owned in which this has happened.  The Far right hand side of the screen approximately 3 inches wide just quit working.  I called panasonic and they have the service company assigned to fix the TV.  The service company came today to pick up the TV and I will be without a TV until it is fixed.  I asked the repairman if this was common and he said that this is the first ST50 model that he has dealt with but has seen it on the XVT series.  I went to You Tube and did a search on it and apparently this is a common issue with TV panels.  There were several videos on how to fix it if you know how to solder equipment.

This can be movies (home movies or studio),  audio (internet, tv, movies,music) and pictures.  I like the fact that it is the center of my home theater setup that allows me to watch content from many sources including streaming from a media server or over the internet.  I have had this plasma tv for four months now.Breaking In / Calibration:  I used the \"slides\"  over a long period (maybe 72 hours) and then did calibration myself.  I looked at some forum settings and started with one that was close and then did a manual calibration based on my setup.  My setup is in a basement with some windows in it facing the south.  My custom setting was much better than the standard version and would highly recommend that you manual calibrate your Plasma TV or at least look at others settings and see if you like the better than the defaults.2D Picture quality: I love the picture quality whether it is 1080p for some streaming to the 1080i cable , 720p (HD movies) or even 480i (DVDs).  This 60\"  at 12 feet away seems fine ;  I never feel that I am too close, too far away or not at the wrong angle.  60\" is all that I was willing to pay but I could see a 65\" being even better.Hockey: Of course the first content that was on (I am from Minnesota) was a hockey game.  I noticed that some people have mentioned that there is some automatic brightening and darkening while the players are moving across the ice.  I NOTICED this brightness change right off the bat before knowing that there were issues from other people.  I am not a hockey fan and don't watch any hockey but it was annoying.  I haven't noticed this effect in other sporting events or types of video.3D Picture quality:  I found with my Samsung 3d glasses and the custom settings that I have, the movies are too dark.  Maybe I will try some different settings when I watch 3D content.  But when I watch 3D content, it is slick and I haven't notice any cross talk.  I have only watched three 3D movies so far.3D Picture quality (update on 6/18):  I didn't realize that there is separate settings for 3D for all inputs and I needed to recalibrate to take in consideration that the 3D glasses when active will be darker to the user.  I recalibrated for 3D inputs to have a \"brighter\" picture and more pleased.  I found that for my TV panel and room that the GAME setting is close to my setting for my CUSTOM 3D while the 2D CUSTOM setting is close to the CINEMA setting.  My Home theater setup is in my basement and I don't have a lot of ambient light.Image Retention:  I was concerned about some image retention issues but I haven't seen any yet.  I don't play video games or leave the screen on one format on the screen very often,  but there is always items (logos) that could give you a problem.  I have used it to mirror an IPad screen and left it on one screen with lots of icons for a while but I didn't notice any image retention issues.Image Retention (6/18 update).  I haven't noticed any image retention related items for the first 6 months.Buzzing: I don't have much high frequency hearing left (over 10K anyway) but I don't hear any buzzing and no one else has remarked about buzzing to me.  Of course,  this is a home theater setup so I do have the sound higher than most.Sound Quality:  Well, I don't care about the sound quality of the plasma itself but when I have it on, it sees adequate for TV types of shows.  I do pump the audio out (optical) to my AVR and the sound is fine.  I think it is PCM 48K ( I haven't seen dolby or DTS)  and I use this when I am streaming audio or video content.Connections:  Has 3 HDMI connections and a component/composite video breakout connector.  Three isn't very many but it works for my setup.  I wish it had a separate composite and a component (vs shared) setup.  I don't use the composite feeds very often but I have to physically switch vs using my avr.  There are two usb connections of which I use one for a wireless keyboard.  The other one I sometimes plug in a flashdrive for content and use the media player.  I am considering using the usb for the camera for skype.Smart TV: This is a nice setup to use as a center piece for a home theater setup. DNLA support: is pretty good but with the ability to use my pc as a media server (Mezzmo) was far beyond what I thought you could do.  I can stream music (flacs, mp3 and transcoded any other audio source) with a reasonable playlist or file structure.  I have it connected via ethernet.  The media player is nice and the audio quality is very good I can show pictures (jpegs, tiffs, gifs, etc) with very high quality and you can do a simple screen show as well.  I think Mezzmo will allow me to do playlists for photos but I will have to see if/how that works. I can stream movies via Mezzmo (for my setup I pre-transcode) but the player and playback seems to work flawlessly. I will have to figure out how to have better audio play back but I mainly have home movies.6/18 update:  I have a better Mezzmo profile now and the audio playback types is better and more robust.  I have not tried a 3D movie via DNLA but I think Mezzmo now supports that.  I have more native formats supported via Mezzmo so there is less pre-transcoding)Internet Capability:  It has some nice apps.  For movies,  I use VUDU or Amazon.  I have some of my movie collection on VUDU and stream directly to my home theater setup and with an internet connection and high speed cable,  I have never had any hesitation or playback problems from SD to HD (720p) to HDX (1080p).  I like the picture quality of 1080p with high quality audio.  For another app,  you can follow a twitter feed while watching a show or movie and I believe you can do this withfacebook as well.  I don't have a camera, but I would think that skype would be a good edition.  Pandora app is slick and has high quality sound (I think it is 128k) but it sounds very nice.  I started to use TuneIn when I want to listen to some radio (could be a ball game or just some music) and it seems to work well.  The audio quality varies with the station, but it seems fine and can be easier than the tuner.6/18 Update:  I do like the latest android app to control the TV when you want to view Youtube or play music via your smart phone.  It is slightly better on the IPAD when you consider the inteface and landscape capability of the IPAD vs my smartphone.  I was not impressed with the web browser. It doesn't work with flash and the interface (remote, keyboard) is difficult at best.  I found that the smartphone or ipad remote apps were better.  You can push a web page that you manipulated with (smartphone or ipad) to the screen easier than trying to use the web browser, remote and keyboard).Misc:  This plasma display does put out some heat.

Davis \"Professional Escapism Artist\"", "ReviewID": "R3GQYV9AI6GICS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned a plasma from another manufacturer; until I bought this TV, I never really saw a plasma that delivered on all the promises. This set does... in spades. After owning a cheaper, inferior panel for three years and being somewhat satisfied, I'm simply stunned by the improvement across the board.Strengths: motion clarity, black level, shadow detail, quietness (yes, all plasmas do buzz a little bit, but there's buzz and there's BUZZ), and resistance to image retention. Yes, even buzz and image retention! So far, this unit has been a champ in all areas but also, surprisingly given all the chatter online, especially in those last two problem areas. Granted, I don't watch network TV at all, so I never display always-on high-contrast logos, and I'm careful about my gaming, so my behavior pattern probably reduces the likelihood of obvious retention. Still, my other plasma (from that other remaining plasma giant) was a retention-machine. Seriously if you looked hard enough at it, it might retain your reflection off its glass.That's not really true but it makes the point I was trying to make.I couldn't ask for a better plasma at this price, and I had no idea what to expect even after poring over all the reviews. Color me delighted... and enveloped in the deepest, richest black I've ever seen on a high-def display. One by one I'm making my friends change their minds about plasma, which is satisfying on a whole 'nother level.The stuff that didn't matter at all to me: it's super-thin, weirdly so for a plasma, and it comes loaded with a whole host of internet features that I'll never use because I use dedicated devices for video sources. I also can't speak to its audio output, because one of the first things I did was disable TV sound. The people who are complaining about the sound quality coming from a 2\" deep panel... are looking at things a little bit cock-eyed, in my opinion.The issues: banding--clear demarcations of specific color zones inside regions that should show smooth gradation--seems a bit more obvious with this set than it was on my last one. I almost wish I hadn't mentioned it because it's the kind of thing you see more clearly if you know it's there to be seen, if that makes sense. Also it seems that Panasonic's image processing algorithms produce an odd effect with 720p sources: if you're within about three feet of the screen, you'll notice what looks like coloring by pastel, or colored wax pencil; some people refer to this as the \"oil painting\" effect. It's nothing to get crazy about--just sit at a sensible distance (more than three feet) from your 55-65\" screen and watch the effect vanish. Problem solved.I'm completely blown away by the quality of this TV, especially considering the price I paid Amazon to deliver it to me. I've heard bad things about Panasonic's warranty management, so I strongly encourage you to buy a SquareTrade warranty no later than 30 days after your purchase. SquareTrade are completely legit--they've taken good care of me in the past and they'll get my business in the future.It's tough, buying a TV online--I appreciate this; if any issues arise in future, I will definitely report back and update the review.

The picture quality is everything that we thought it would be. During HD television shows, my wife often comments that it looks like we are looking through a window at the characters. To clarify, these are not the over-bright, too vivid, colors you get with an LED TV, these are true-to-life colors. We followed a break-in procedure that we read about and so far we have not had any problems with burn-in even after hours of continuous video game playing. The only con I can think of is that on bright screens (white or other bright colors) the buzz of the plasma can be heard.

Viera. Prior to purchasing it, I returned a 55-in. LED TV I had just purchased and watched for about a week, so I was able to see the performance of both systems first-hand.  The LED TV was impressive (compared to my other systems that are a couple of years old!), but in my opinion, the Viera was a clear winner in terms of performance in high-speed action and sport scenes.  Although the colors and brightness were impressive on the LED TV, I found the performance of the Viera even better. I considered the extra power consumed by the Viera, but when I calculated the difference in the power consumption of the Viera and the LED TV (relatively minor) and factored in the superior performance of the Viera, I am satisfied that I made the right decision. i have not experienced any problems with \"image persistance\" and have decided not to use \"break-in\" slides. As much as I'm enjoying the tv, it won't take me long to reach 100 hours of viewing time!  I think that the anti-image retention technology built into the unit is helpful.  It's a bit difficult to describe the difference in viewing in a large room a large-screen tv with superior video performance and that of viewing a smaller system, but the best way I can decribe it is that the Viera immerses you in the viewing experience and drives whatever you are viewing (and hearing) a bit deeper into your consciousness, whether it is panoramic nature scenes, historical documentaries or BSC College Football Championships!

This tv isby far one of the best tv's i've experienced in person. From the crisp picture to the amazing blacks it produces, it really makesyou feel as if you are looking into a window. I was truly blown away how some scenes looked, as I did not expect it to producesuch deep blacks. I watched the Dark Knight and it was just fantastic how well the tv produced the picture. This was with nocolor option tuning and right out the box set to cinema. With some adjustments from online sources from a quick google search of other peoples settings, I dialed the tv in custom mode and was again blown away with how much better it looked. Aside from picture quality, it's also loaded with features, 3D, Netflix, Smart Apps, iOS/Andriod remote control app, wifi, ect ect.The only bad I can say is the speakers don't leave much to be desired but when investing this type of money into a tv, one can not simply be using the TV speakers. I highly recommend a sound system even if it's just a sound bar to enhance the sound. Honestly, to it's defense, a majority of tv's don't really come with amazing speakers, so I really can't take away a star for that.

I decided to upgrade and I'm glad I did.  This TV has an outstanding picture, and many of the online reviews I saw said that the picture on the ST can be nearly as good as the more expensive GT if the ST was adjusted properly.  I've only moderately adjusted the picture and I'm very impressed.  I'm also glad I upgraded, I was afraid that the 65\" was going to be too big, but it fits my room perfectly.  I have it mounted to the wall with a Cheetah mount (not overly impressed - see my review there), and mounting is a challenge at 125 lbs.  But the included base is very attractive and could be used in many instances.  One concern I had was that the mount screw locations were low, located near the bottom of the unit rather than at the top, but it doesn't seem to be a problem so far.One really nice feature is the 3 HDMI inputs.  They're very near the edge of the TV so don't buy cables with long strain relief or they might stick out past the edge and be visible.  There's also an R-G-B input that also has an input for analog video and audio in (RCA) and Panasonic includes the custom adapter - very nice.This TV also saved me some $$ by letting me postpone the purchase of a new home theater tuner.  By using the 3 HDMI inputs on the TV I can put digital audio and video into the TV.  Then the TV has an optical digital audio out that I can send to my current tuner (a high-end Denon unit that is almost 14 years old).  Otherwise I would have had to get a new tuner with HDMI inputs and then send out via HDMI from the tuner to the TV.  This optical audio out let me keep the digital audio and great sound quality without the need for a new tuner.I was also VERY impressed with the speakers in this TV.  They sound MUCH better than the 43\" Samsung plasma I have in the Master BR.  If you don't have a center channel speaker for your surround sound you could easily use the TV.  The in unit speakers blended in with my Klipsch surround speakers.  Impressive.The frame on the TV is a little cheesy, it's black plastic with about 1/4\" of clear bead around the edge.  I keep waiting for it to glow blue when I connect via wireless through Viera.  The Viera works very well, it's easily accessed through the remote and things load very quickly.  I was impressed with that too.  Eventually I'll hardwire via CAT5, but the wireless is doing better than expected so far.I haven't tried the 3D, mostly because I don't have any glasses.  Too bad that you don't get at least 2 pair with the TV, but at this price I guess it's not so bad.I prefer the plasma picture to LCD/LED.

And just a quick note about the shipping - I was very pleased with everything.  Arrived on time and the shipping company called the day before to arrange a time.  They gave me a window of 8am-5pm and I knew I couldn't be here that entire time so the backup plan was during the evening.  Anyway, the delivery guy called early in the day and said he was nearby, but unfortunately I wasn't going to be there but I told him I'd be back around 3:30.  He said that was okay.

The sound bar may also be the reason we don't hear the buzz that I heard in the store. A good set of speakers seems to eliminate the presence of any audible buzz.

No problems at all with shipping -- the delivery crew carried the box right up to my apartment and opened it up so I could confirm it wasn't damaged. It was too cold to plug in right away, so I waited a few hours before confirming video output and no bad pixels. These TVs are huge, but thin and relatively light for the size. The foam packaging is sturdy enough to hold the TV upright by itself until you muscle it onto the stand or a wall mount. Get help for that -- it's simple too awkward (and expensive) to manhandle alone.=============================================================================================Pros:Picture quality is fantastic for media consumption. With a dark room and calibrated correctly, you'll be blown away by the dynamic range and color reproduction. Games show basically no lag.HDMI is the boss. One cable to a receiver is all you ever need, and if the receiver supports HDMI control you can turn them both on and off and control volume with the same remote.To be honest, I don't use the speakers or apps on the TV, and haven't tried 3D yet. I got it because these produce some of the best quality 2D images in the industry.=============================================================================================Cons:You won't want this TV in a bright room. Its not bright enough to compete with the sun (even indirect sunlight can make it seem somewhat washed out). Be aware the screen is glossy glass. They have some anti-glare technology built in, but lights in front of the screen will still show up as reflections.Another typical plasma problem -- if enough of the screen is bright/close to white, you'll hear light buzzing. Generally not an issue as the sound from your movies/games/cable will drown it out.I never got firmware updates to work over Wifi. The downloader always gave up a few percent into the download. Grabbing the files off the internet and putting them on a flash drive was dead simple though.

It has a very smooth and crisp picture, as touted by CNET and other friends that have owned Panasonic plasma.  I was hesitant about Panasonic plasma too but I figured it was going into a space I built for it in my entertainment center, not hung on the wall where you can see its profile.  I also heard it uses more energy, I think it was like $30 a year more (less than $3 a month - I considered it a premium for better picture quality - I pay for everything else anyways like HD channels, caller ID, etc.).  I really like the picture.  Plus, when else do you get to pay less money for better quality (picture).  I think I would have had to pay $4,000 for a comparable LED TV.  The TVs only become better and cheaper, so I like to buy at the high middle range where I get good technology at a reasonable price.I noticed it does give off noticeable heat.  I can feel it when I reach into my cabinets by the TV.  It's can double as an additional heat source for your home.  Just kidding - it does not give off that much.

It looks amazing. 1080P, flawless full motion.Games that are under 60 frames per second, WILL HAVE A DOUBLING EFFECT.Just Google \"st50 doubling effect\" to read more about what exactly this means.My advice is that if you want the optimal gaming experience on the ST50, wait for next gen consoles, where hopefully 60 frames per second visuals will become more standard.  Or game from a good PC.IR is minimal if present at all for me.  It took hours of playing Infamous 2, for the game's HUD on my screen to slightly show signs of IR, but it went away in under a few minutes of TV watching.Again another advantage of the PC is that many HUD's (notable for causing IR) can be disabled or patched out with the right google searches.  This minimizes any IR concern.

J Wilson \"tomjw217\"", "ReviewID": "R362Y92NGI5C55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This plasma flat screen in the third down in Panasonic's lineup of plasma TV's. There are several excellent reviews for this line of TVs, but I took a step I could afford after our Hitachi 57\" projection TV died. I did a lot of research and finally settled on a TV that was a size larger than the old Hitachi at a price that was reasonable. Setup was easy. We placed the TV on its included stand (some assembly of the stand required), plugged it in, and were watching cable in about 20 minutes. It has taken about a week to get really used to the larger picture and incredibly sharp picture, but we'd never go back. The set comes with about a dozen apps, including Netflix, Amazon, and other popular streaming services. All are accessible with the remote, as are a plethora of settings for the TV itself. We bought a 60\" cabinet to place the TV on. The TV on its stand is rock-solid. Small children will be unable to get the proper leverage to topple the set -- it would take a real effort for me (6'3\", 250 lbs) to tip it over. One feature of this set we really appreciate is the non-reflectiveness of the screen. Our old Hitachi reflected everything in the room even with no lights on. The Panasonic scarcely reflects anything at all. We also like the automatic dimming feature which dims the picture as lights are shut off (this can be turned off). Surprising also is the quality of sound from the built-in speakers. No, it's not 5.1 or 7.1, but it's definitely acceptable used alone. Note for 3D fanatics: the Panasonic 3D glasses run around $40 a pair. Reviews state that Samsung 3D glasses are compatible at under $20 a pair. We haven't tried out 3D yet. If you do a lot of data entry, using the remote is cumbersome at best. Invest in a good Bluetooth keyboard. We could have spent about 1K more for Panasonic's top-of-the-line, or about $500 for the next step up.

I went through 2 different tvs (a different lower model Panasonic plasma, a higher end Samsung LCD) before I settled on this one.  My main issue is light control in my family room.  As you may or may not know, Plasmas are glass screens and reflect quite a bit of light.  The first Panasonic I bought was nearly as good as this model, but it didn't quite have the same glare filter on it, and was like a mirror.  I reluctantly returned it and purchased a high end Sammy LCD.  I've been a plasma guy for years and am used to the picture.  The Sammy looked great for movies, but for broadcast content from DirecTV, it looked horrible.  I am one of the select portion of the population that can see the motion blur on LCDs.  So, took TV back and purchased this one.  Haven't regretted it once since.While it still does give off some glare, it's fairly negligible.  It's mostly noticeable during dark sequences from your source content.The built in apps are great.  I use Pandora and Netflix frequently.  I have used the Amazon app and it works well.Highly recommended TV for the money.

Read the reviews on Cnet and other web sources and you'll see why. I've had great luck with other Panasonic TV's in the past and decided to invest into the ST50 for my basement.  I was very hesitant to order an expensive electronics product online based off all the horror stories on Amazon, but pulled the trigger anyway due to the best price being offered. On delivery, the Tv's box was in good condition. One delivery person arrived with CEVA and was very helpful and professional.  He offered to carry the 65\" TV to my basement himself but I insisted on helping. He helped inspect in the Tv as well. I received the 2nd generation ST50 which has a built date of November 2012.I am currently running D-Nice's \"prep slides\" on the ST50 for about 70 continuous hrs now and plan to apply his after prep calibration settings. He also posted non prep calibration settings for this tv on the HighDefJunkies Forum. I've applied his settings in the past and have been very happy with them. His settings are based off his professional post calibration report. These settings will save you the money of having a calibration done from an independent source if you're a videophile like myself. People need to remember that most, if not all streaming sources and cable/satellite sources are at best, 1080i or 720p.  Blu ray discs are your one guaranteed 1080p source which will make your TV come alive. Also if you're hesitant on buying a plasma TV, they have come a long ways over the years.  They are a good investment for a lot of reasons one being they last longer then an lcd type panel.  They are at half their picture life when a back lit LCD type TV is at it's full picture life. In other words, they will continue to display great picture quality for a very long time. Due to the deep inky type black levels displayed in plasmas they have a great contrast ratio which helps it achieve great overall picture quality. Also, if you're a gamer, plasmas screen refresh rate cannot be beat.  If you're thinking about pulling the trigger on this TV, do it.

Nicolai \"Author of 'Alex'\"", "ReviewID": "R18L1W0XQV1YQM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've never owned a plasma television before.  My previous TV was a Sony SX-RD, about six years old, and it started getting the dreaded \"yellow glob,\" so we gave it away.  I bought this one based on the reviews here on Amazon and had some reservations going in.  I'm going to talk about what those reservations were, and what my actual experience has been.1) Burn-In / Image RetentionI'm a gamer.  All this stuff about \"wait 100 hours before using the ST50 for gaming\" had me really worried, because in my house, that ain't happening.  I play a lot of Street Fighter IV, with the static meters in the screen corners, and lately my son and I have been playing a ton of Mario on the Wii-U, with its permanent Star Coin icons in the top-left.When I got the TV I made sure the Pixel Orbiter was on (it appears to be turned on by default).  I also left the TV on overnight a couple times on a cable channel just to exercise the screen and break it in a little.  But I started playing games on it day one.I'm pleased to say I didn't notice any image retention whatsoever in the first month.  About a week ago I did see some retention from the Mario Star Coin icons.  It was only viewable when the screen image was predominantly white, and even then it looked like a mirage.  I doubt I would have noticed it if I hadn't been looking for it, but I was.  Like a hawk.Long story short:  I ran the Vertical Scroll Bars once and parked the TV on a cable channel for an hour or two, and the retention went away.  I haven't had any other problems prior or since (and I was up until 2 AM last night playing Street Fighter).So, yes, it requires a little baby-sitting, but for a picture this good (see #3), it is well worth it.2)  The BuzzMy understanding from the research I've done is that all plasmas buzz.  It's just a part of the technology.  Knowing this going in, I tried to find a TV that didn't get marked down a lot for the buzz.  This one had a few bad reviews around the buzz, but most people said it sounded fine, so I took the risk.I'm pleased to say my experience with the buzz has been practically non-existent.  As other reviewers have mentioned, I did hear it once when I climbed behind the TV to fiddle with a connection while the TV was on.  Also as other reviewers have suggested, don't watch your TV from behind.  ; )Buzz is a non-issue.3) PictureI wanted a fantastic, crisp, gorgeous, jaw-dropping picture that handled motion excellently and just let you forget about everything but what was on the screen.  I wanted games to blow my mind and movies to be completely absorbing.That is exactly what I got.  I love the picture on this thing.  LOVE IT.4) InputsThe only caution I would offer is this:  is make sure you know what inputs you are expecting to use on your TV, and that the ST-50 will suffice in that regard.  The TV has only 2 HDMI inputs and a SINGLE, SHARED input for both component (HD) and composite (SD).  I have a Yamaha receiver that doesn't consolidate its output signals (i.e., if there are machines hooked up to it that use both component cables and other machines that use composite cables, I need to run BOTH sets of cables out to the TV).  I was not able to connect both my composite and component machines at the same time without doing some serious jury-rigging.  Ultimately I was able to consolidate some things and get everything on to either HDMI or composite, so this didn't prove to be a serious issue for me personally, but buyer beware.Overall, love the TV.

I was very disappointed especially because I thought a $2000 TV would have been close to perfection. I returned it and decided to buy the Panasonic TCP60ST50, especially since it was on the top of the CNET list as the \"best plasma\" for the price. Even WITHOUT calibration, the raw quality of this TV was apparent the *moment* I turned it on and played a blu ray movie ( It's Complicated) The first thing anyone will notice with this TV is the just how BLACK the blacks really look! It's like unbelievable, it's not dark just richly black. After some simple calibrations (I prefer my screen to be more on the bright side even in a pitch black room) what happens is you suddenly realize you have no doubt that this is the TV for you! It's the different between simply \"liking\" a TV and having that guttural feeling that it's undeniably great. I think that most people will be very satisfied with my calibrations.Contrast 95  ( yes bright but I think most people will find this to be optimal)Brightness 56 ( keeps those blacks as black as possible)Color 49Sharpness 60 ( I know most sites say \"0\" but once you try it for yourself  it's obvious it would be insane because to set it a 0 because things look extremely blurry AND this TV is SO good that even grain at 60 sharpness  is not that noticeable.WARM 2In Advanced SettingsMosquito NR OFFMotion Smoother OFFBlack Level - Light ( yes because \"dark\" is insanely black, way to dark, the 56 brightness is the perfect level of blackness)In Pro SettingsColor Space 0ALL W/B  at \"0\"black extension 0gamma adjustment 2.6panel brightness midcontour emphasis OFFAGC 0Blurays looks SO good that they look even better than real life! lol...and SD looks as good as it can get with things like Everybody Loves Raymond Two and a Half Men.

If you don't see things popping out at you, then it's probably not hooked up right (really need to use HDMI connection for it).The only downside I had was that the power light is a bright red led at the bottom center of the TV, and once in a while my eye would catch it, and then it would annoy me, but most people watching would never realize it (but once it gets in your brain, it's hard to ignore).

I have had it for about 2 months now and I do not have any complaints. Not one. The picture is bright and clear, even in the sun-lit room that the TV is in. Previously, I had a 1080p LCD TV and I am amazed at much much better the picture is. The most noticable thing is the depth of contrast and the sharpness, especially with motion. There is almost no motion blur. In fact, the noticable lack of motion blur was actually disorienting at first, but now that I have gotten used to it, it really looks amazing.While looking at this TV I questioned whether or not to upgrade to the GT or VT models. I would not consider myself to be a \"videophile\" and when I looked at the screens in the store I couldn't tell the difference. You certainly get more bells and whistles with the VT, but that's not what I was looking for. I just wanted a TV with a great picture and a reasonable price. This TV is both of those things.Since buying the TV I also bought the Panasonic BDT220 bluray player and the Panasonic HTB550 speaker system. These all connect seamlessly to the TV though Viera Link. This is a really nice feature and I highly recommend this combination or one similar to it. The basic functions of the bluray player and the speaker system can be operated through the TV remote, no need to switch remotes or buy a universal remote. The bluray player is VERY fast and the speakers sound great.I can't say enough good things about this TV and Panasonic products in general.", "Date": "November 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "It took longer to repair then I owned the unit", "Author": "Sturgis", "ReviewID": "R2VWS1ZN9TFADU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "30 days after receipt one complete vertical panel failed during general use.

As pointed out, my review is incorrectly listed under the ST50 (vice GT50 that I own and discuss).  Check Panasonic for a side-by-side comparison, as desired and see if the $500 price difference matters to you.Update 1:  \"Ghosting\" is not present, based on my 20/20 vision anyway.  In fact, as I become more familar with my new TV, I've experimented with the 2D to 3D upscale/convertion feature. For example, it turns my Apple TV icons into 3D.  It adds depth to your favorite YouTube music video.  I would say the 3D effect is about 25% of a full \"3D Movie\".  \"Ghosting\" only happens when your active glasses go into standby mode, or they didn't connect correctly (turn them off, back on again), which is very infrequent.Update 2: Attention A/V receiver owners!  While I may be stating the obvious to you, older receivers do not \"pass through\" the 3D video signal to your 3D HDTV.  This means your blu-ray 3D disc is \"unrecognized\" by the TV and doesn't start.  A Denon AVR-1913 solved that problem for me (with fantastic surround sound).After researching several online reviews that are now ranking Panasonic products higher than I expected, I opted for the Panasonic 60\" GT50 plasma series.  I'm awe-struck.I performed the home installation with the help of a friend.  I purchased a 60\" wall mount from Amazon and installed it myself in about an hour.  Pick your TV's location, but then use a \"stud finder\" to be able to anchor your TV to the wall securely.  I used a tape measure and pencil to guess my wall location, but then refined the location based on the 16\" spaced 2x4 studs behind your home's drywall.  If you miss, you can spackle/repaint with no harm done.  Accurately/safely installed the wall mount for your heavy/expensive HDTV is critical.  Take your time on this step.Next, I purchased a few 3D certified, Cat. 2 HDMI cables from Amazon.  The $79.99 cables at Best Buy are only $10 or so on Amazon, depending on the length.  I only purchased six foot cables, and for the final finish I will need longer.  Lesson learned: don't skimp on HDMI cable length.  You can either \"final finish\" the HDTV look with paintable cable trays, or a more aggressive \"in wall\" project.There seems to be much debate about the Panasonic \"active 3D\" (USB charged...plug them into your HDTV USB ports and leave them on \"dangle-charge\" if you'd like).  I had NO problems with the glasses I ordered from Amazon.  The $80 glasses (each) at Best Buy were about $50 on here.  Don't worry about the negative reviews...it seems some owners of older Panasonic HDTVs are not reading the fine print for compatibility.  Download the owner's manual from Panasonic, get the spec/model glasses you need, and order from Amazon.  These \"active shutter\" 3D glasses are critical to the 3D technology, so I recommend following what Panasonic says to do (or call and ask their tech support before your order).  The people that leave one star on these glasses are NOT following instructions.  I do wear prescription glasses, and the 3D glasses were comfortable...(as best can be wearing two pairs of glasses).  My glasses do NOT degrade the comfort/quality at all.I opted for the Panasonic 3D Blu ray player.  I prefer to keep TV/Blu Ray players together from the same manufacturer.  Both the TV and the Player connect to your home WiFi (again, ignore the negative reviews about this aspect...follow the instructions).  You can surf YouTube, the Internet, Hulu, Netflix, etc from either device.  I don't notice any difference between my Sony HDTV/Blu Ray setup in terms of normal 2D (fantastic HD) quality; however, the Panasonic 3D technology again, is amazing.The Blu-Ray player is DLNA compatible (use Google, as necessary) to connect to videos, music, pictures on your home laptop/desktop computers.  Warning:  setting up Windows for DLNA was not trivial for my make/model/version of Computer and Windows.  Use Google to finder other users' lessons-learned if you run into problems.  Otherwise, my Blu Ray player found my home network and accessed my pictures on my laptop, as I had established through the DLNA setup.  Flawless...once you get the process established on your laptop.I tested the system with an Aquarium 3D disc.  Wow.  It honestly felt like I was looking into an aquarium with an amazing depth-of-field.  As I moved side-to-side, the 3D affect did not diminish with this 3D HDTV (my first experience).  If the kids lay on the floor, someone sits off center in a side chair, etc....everyone will enjoy an amazing experience.  However, sitting on the sofa with 3D glasses on staring at an Aquarium, while relaxing did get boring after awhile.  I'll keep the $10 3D blu-ray to show off the system.I tried several 3D movies just to preview the quality of 3D effects.  Harry Potter 7 (Pt. 2), How to Tame a Dragon, Lion King, and Green Lantern were all equally amazing in terms of the 3D affect.  It brought new life to an (old) Lion King movie, and the Harry Potter 3D movie took me back to opening day at the IMAX theater.  The 3D effect is much better than I've seen in IMAX...I suspect due to the intense Plasma screen combined with an \"active\" 3D glasses set.I will say the sound system is dull, as it would be on any HDTV.  I'll connect a soundbar, or a 7.1 surround sound system to it.  However, I wanted to evaluate the 3D/Quality before finalizing the \"home theater\" package.  A solid 7.1 surround sound system will be the \"cherry on the cake\".I can see this technology being the final step in \"I'll wait until the move comes out on 3D blu ray and watch it at home\".  Regal Cinema has met its match.  The cinema screen size and quality now compare and the popcorn is cheaper at home.I did compare the 55/60/65 inch options.  Go Google \"HDTV viewing distance\" to find out what size TV you should be looking at for your particular room.  Then, notice the price difference.  60\" was within my budget for the project and in the end, I'm very happy with the TV size, viewing distance, and the TV's overall look on my entertainment room's wall (which my be important to the wives out there than the husbands).  You'll have to do some measurements, estimate the viewing distance, and check your wallet for your particular situation.  \"Big\" isn't necessarily better for a smaller viewing distance, but I wouldn't go unnecessarily small and diminish the 3D effect.  If you're struggling to save $300 on a $3000 project, I'd wait 6 months and recheck all the prices.Finally, the only reason I opted to purchase the TV at Best Buy was due to my impatience.  However, don't be intimidated by purchasing a large item from Amazon (I purchased a Sony HDTV from them a few years ago).  They have streamlined the process, but the \"curbside\" delivery does take a few days, and honestly, my \"weekend project\" didn't care to wait.  (I was impressed you could select an after work 4pm to 6pm delivery window online during ordering).  Otherwise, you can save some money (as we all know) in a trusted/reliable Amazon product delivery process.  Read the fine print though.  If Amazon tells you to inspect the \"shock indicators\" on the box and document if the TV has been exposed to shock, then do it.  If your TV fails due to mishandling, we all know Amazon will make it right.That's my $0.25 input to YOUR shopping research.

To get to the needed menus to make all the adjustments you must choose the Custom menu selection.Now for the bad part.  Don't even think you can listen to the news (much less programs with any dynamic sound) with the built-in speakers.  The laughable part is that Panasonic devotes a full screen promoting the benefits of the TV's sound system.  If I was to compare the sound to something else I have owned; the sound would be equivalent to the hand held AM radio I had as a kid in the late 1960's.So I had to buy an in-expensive Boston Acoustics Sound Bar and Subwoofer just so  I can listen to normal programing on the TV.  That sould bar is perfect for most TV shows.  But when I play a movie, I power up the home theater sound system with its 1800 watt subwooofer.  That combination makes a great home theater.Except for the sound it is a very good TV and I see why it was won many Editor's Choices from differnt publications.

I am obsessed with picture quality, that said... here it goes:I bought this TV because I wanted a larger tv in my living room. Currently I have an 46\" LED full array/w/ localized dimming LED Sony TV in my bedroom and she is my priced possession, this is a very expensive tv with an absolutely AMAZINGLY PERFECT picture quality. There is no way I could afford a LED tv like the sony in a 65\" size format and that is why I decided to look into panasonic plasmas(the best in the business).While the panasonic plasma does not deliver the same picture quality, it still does deliver and excellent image quality for such a large tv at a very reasonable price, It produces excellent blacks and very rich deep colors. The speakers are also much more powerful than my Sony tv, but still recommend you get a full surround system with it. Here is my complain about picture quality; the TV does produce Excellent Blacks, the problem with those blacks? well the tv can't maintain them when the room has light, any kind of light. Don't get me wrong you still get a great viewing experience, but no where near as good as if you had a pitch dark room. The one other thing was that the TV could be a little brighter, Panasonic presets the tv at medium brightness and now I can see why. When you set it full, you do get the perfect amount of brightness, but it destroys the color balance. I tried playing with the settings, but in the end I returned it medium, I just could neutralize the color situation.Be aware that in TV's this size is when 1080p material comes into play. You will be able to notice the difference between 720 and 1080 content. The problem? All the cable and satellite companies stream at 720p, so yeah that can get frustrating. Specially after you rent a blue ray movie and see what the TV is actually capable of. But I guess its one of the issues that you have to deal with when purchasing a big TV, other the price :-)The software in TV is pretty solid, it responds very fast to my commands. I do have one problem with Viera internet TV, for some reason when you select viera the TV dims itself a little and I can't figure out why. I tried playing a little with it, but quickly gave up. I figured I will never use it anyway so what is the point in wasting time there. But I am sure some people will use for netflix and such, so just be aware of it. I think the TV goes into cinema mode or something like that.Just to note that since I had so many components I also bought this remote URC WR7 Universal Remote Control for up to 7 A/V Components with 4 Favorite Channel Buttons and it was a great addition to my home theater, now I can control absolutely everything from one remote. Currently the remote is programmed for the tv, a motorola dvr, an Apple Tv and a 3D blue ray sound system.I also bought this TV stand and it looks great on it, I highly recommend this stand Sonax E-0062-BF Fiji 60-Inch TV Component Bench, Ravenwood Black its a perfect fit.The TV is very heavy, you will need someone else to help you move it around.All that said I am very happy with this purchase, I actually cancelled my summer vacation to afford this tv and what a great decision that was. Watching movies in my house beats going to my local movie theater(better picture quality and way better sound) and I avoid all the crowds. There is the waiting part for the movie to come out on blue-ray, but I can deal with that. Don't think it over, if you're looking for a big tv this is the way to go.

The bad rating is for Panasonic support.  The blacks are deep and and the colors crisp. The display was everything I hoped for. The panel is super thin and visually attractive. The only quibble was the Viera Tools menu to access streaming services loaded rather slowly and occasionally dropped out.I loved it right up until I tried to play my Xbox 360 via the component input. The color red was obviously not coming through, so I swapped component cables and still had no red color. I plugged the Xbox into a different tv and had red color with both cables, so it was obviously not the cable or Xbox having an issue. My Blu-Ray player worked fine on the HDMI input, so the problem lay somewhere in the component input on the TV. I tried calling the \"Concierge Service\" they claim is award winning. If that is true, then I really hope I never run in to whoever lost that competition. First try, the \"tech\" reads from the script, and has me repeat all the steps I have already tried. I'm not angry at this point since I know that is their SOP and they have to do it since some people don't know you need to switch the TV to component in. Unfortunately they were clearly stringing me out on hold during this process hoping I would go away. She put me on hold for an average of 10 minutes between each step, meaning it took over 65 minutes for them to walk me through switching the cable, setting the input, and power cycling the TV. By that point I was pretty irritated, and they finally agreed to escalate my call. I alledgedly would receive a call back within 2-3 days. I never received the call. I called back after 3 days, and they insisted on walking me through the whole script again. Needless to say I was not happy. Again another claim of escalation and 2-3 days. After 3 more days of waiting I call again. This time they at least glance at my case and say \"oh I will put a priority on this, you should hear soon\". I call back the next day after no call, and get another script reader who refuses to look at my case and tries to string me out again hoping I will go away. By this point I have had enough so I express my displeasure, and hang up. Amazon CS was much more helpful, and didn't sound surprised by the poor Panasonic support. They approved a replacement to be sent out and the defective unit will be picked up by the delivery company, so it should be a low hassle experience. All in all the ST50 is worth a try, just hope you don't experience the frustration I have.- Updated 12/2/2012I have had the replacement TV for a few weeks now and I still can't believe how awesome the display quality is.

They also would not set it into our entertainment system which was a problem, since I could not do it myself due to weight.  (I got help later from a friend)  So far, we are very disappointed with the picture quality.  Our six year old 50\" Panasonic plasma is much more vibrant and bright than this picture, and that is compared to about every setting I have tried on the ST50.  We just visited a friend last night for the Super Bowl, and they had a 65\" Samsung plasma, and it just blew away our Panasonic in terms of brightness, color, vibrancy, clarity.  I checked multiple comments here on Amazon for preferred settings on the custom setting, and we have seen some improvement, but the picture on HDTV with a HD cable feed is just washed out and dead.  Last night, we saw a vertical green line show up on the far right side of the screen, so this is new and perhaps a sign of a quality problem?  I called both Panasonic concierge service and Amazon service today, to see what they suggest, and they both want me (of course) to call in when I am in front of the TV so they can help diagnose what might be going on.I am also very under-impressed with the VIERA connect capabilities, using the remote is very clumsy, and several of the wireless feeds are slow and the images (such as Youtube) freeze while more video is downloaded.  This is not true when using the Blueray wireless connectivity capabilities, so I suspect something is wrong with the wireless speed on the TV.Will update this once I talk to both customer service groups to see what they suggest.  At this point, I would gladly trade this Panasonic for a Samsung plasma.  I stayed away from the Samsung plasma just because most internet info out there indicates that Panasonic is #1 in plasma technology.RECENT UPDATE - after spending about 40 minutes on the phone with Amazon support last night, checking all the calibration settings, the rep indicated that I had the TV setup correctly, and that if the picture was still poor, that I likely had a defective unit.  We agreed that Amazon would ship me another TV (same model) and take the existing one back.  I expect to get the replacement in about a week, and hope that is exactly the case, that it was defective.  I have continued to compare the best picture I can get on this set to the same channel feed on my older 50\" Panasonic 720p plasma, and I just cannot get the color richness and sharpness to match the old set.  We tried switching out the HDMI cable thinking maybe it was defective, but it made no difference.  I am guessing the new replacement will be a lot better.

My wife even had to admit it, and trust me, she was a fan of the LED.

I can't personally justify the extra $900 for the 60\" GT50, but read the negatives below and see if it would be a better fit for you...The bad:1. I'm not sure why everyone rates this as a perfect TV given the fact that the 48Hz mode flickers way too much when viewing blu-rays.  Why would Panasonic advertise that the TV does 48Hz if it's unusable?!?!  There appears to be no way to watch blu-rays in true 24Hz playback so you may want to consider the GT50 series if you are into that sort of thing.  My projector has a 24Hz mode and I do think it makes a slight difference.2. Another big negative is even though Panasonic's website [...] states that the 2012 Viera TVs can be turned on over the network using the Viera Remote app, only the GT50 and VT50 can!  How misleading is that?  Why make a fancy app that is very capable, then remove a convenient feature from one TV and not the others?!?  Am I supposed to grab the IR remote first to turn on the TV then use my tablet?!?My guess is that the ST50 is capable of WOL or something similar, but Panny has blocked the feature in the firmware to differentiate the models.  That's fine, but Panasonic should be clear about that so as to not mislead customers.  The Sharp TV I returned had a great IP Control protocol printed in the manual and you could even turn on the TV with it.  Maybe Panasonic can learn something from them?3. The TV also has no RS232 and Panasonic's website does not give all of the IR discrete commands for the 2012 models, only for years 2003-2007.  How useless is that?!?  If you think you can call Pansonic support, think again.  Their call center support is not helpful at all.  If you have a home automation system or want to use a tablet as a remote, your best bet is to buy the GT50 or VT50.  The VT30 had RS232 control, I'm not sure if the VT50 will, but it's worth a look.4. 3D does have ghosting and it's a joke.  I don't know why some of the reviews say it isn't.  I had previously used the Sharp LC-60LE847u and the 3D was much better with far less ghosting.  Maybe I wouldn't have noticed it had I not tried the Sharp first, but it is there.  I don't plan to watch many 3D movies, so I don't care though.5. Read on avsforum before purchasing if you watch hockey.  Several folks complain about FBR, but only when watching hockey?!?  I think using Custom mode helps alleviate this some, but I don't know as I never had any FBR issues and I don't watch hockey.6. The sdcard reader doesn't seem to be working for me on a 2GB sdcard.

Pilot is the name btw.. so I selected Fri morning.. disappointed but will live,, right..? so wrong.. I work nights and have been up since 2:30pm Thur, it's now 0110 Fri afternoon and guess what?? no delivery.. absolutely poor service, no call that they chgd delivery, Amazon had to call them to even get info on the situation.. my advice,, Amazon is good IF you only order small items, large stuff is metered out to these fly by nite cheap services.. not worth the hassle.. I let Amazon and thier cohorts keep the tv right on that truck.. Enjoy it Amazon and Pilot gets to ship it back..a 1700.00 deal washed up by cheap service..update.... Amazon was upset at the delivery service, or lack of..lol. schdg the appt isnt an appointment of your convience, it is in fact where you live that dictates the \"when\" it will be delivered, that's what the delivery service is doing without telling anyone, on thier own. You have to call Amazon, and they call them to find out your real delv time. But Amazon is aware of this and still using them so they aren't really that upset with em.. right? They feed the beast by continuing to use them and us customers are at thier mercy..", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "EXCELLETN TV/ BUT PROBLEMS WITH SHIPPMENT", "Author": "antonio hernandez", "ReviewID": "RDKP12FR1R91I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I DONT HAVE ANY COMPLAIN WITH THIS TV, THE ONLY BIG OR HUGE DOWNSIDE IS THAT THE FIRST ORDER ARRIVED BROKE, AMAZON RESPOND AND DID THE EXCHAGE FOR ANOTHER ONE , BUT IT ARRIVED WITH THE SCREEN BROKEN AGAIN, AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE IR AGAIN, THE PROCESS LASS ALMOST 4 MONTHS UNTIL I CAN PLUG IN MY NEW TV TO MY WALL.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't post till you've used the 3D!", "Author": "Scott L.

Decent... the best after calibration.Great for occasional blue-ray movies? Yes...awesome.Great for heavy usage of streaming content, standard TV, or games? No...you'll ruin TV.Plasma degrades. Baby it or burn-in, weird lines, blobs, and other weirdness will keep you forever entertained with visits from your local repairman. Think you can be careful enough? Good luck and check back in 3+ months later. Look through a series of color slides (including black and white) to see your damage.This idea that I would be buying a baby is not something I was willing to live with. Imagine buying a treadmill that you are told you can only carefully walk in the center (no natural running).There is a reason why Panasonic is losing money on their plasma TVs and other companies have discontinued plasma. Is LED problem free and better picture quality? No, but at least is is worry free and can last forever without degrading.

The board is a plug in, and to get the \"deal\" it was required that I use a repair shop.I junked the TV (expensive repairs that were only waranteed for six months with a part known for failure) and bought a Samsung.

First of all I owned the tcp58v10 and enjoyed every moment of it,however I wanted 3D and internet options, so after doing the research I decided on the Tcp60st50.  I was determined to purchase it on Amazon, but I wanted to see it in person first so I went into my local store as mentioned earlier.  I was amazed at how amazing the picture looked.  The not only improved upon black levels but the cabinet design is a big step up in the reight direction as well. It is significantly thinner than the previous models,and is loaded with built in wi-fi and internet apps.  I did end up purchasing it at Video Only the day I walked in because I encountered a very friendly, knowledgable sales person named James Tobin.  He explained the new technology to me, showed me some comparable models, and was quick to point out that Video Only was already more than a $100 cheaper than any internet sight including Amazon.  He also pointed out that Video Only answers the phone with people, and not just anybody but the actual sales associates who sell the product.  This made me realize that I would be able to get free tech support if I ever have any questions for the life of my television.  I decided on the tv and he then took me to the sound area where I was able to get a new sub and receiver, that was HDMI 1.4 compatable for 3d pass through and ARC which he explained to me the benefit, and I was eager to upgrade.  After all was said and done not only was the prices on the products that I was looking at significantly cheaper in the store than I could buy on line, he worked me a package and I ended up saving hundreds of dollars on everything.Bottom line Best Tv and Best experience", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't buy into the hype", "Author": "greenman \"greenman\"", "ReviewID": "R3F8NSM918DD1B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have U-Verse, and have been happy like a clam until my 9-year old Samsung DLP died, so I got into the market for a new TV.I've read quite possibly everything about this TV (cnet, pcmag, amazon, you name it). 95% of the reviews glorified this TV. So I bought it, without checking it out in a store to verify in person the picture quality - big mistake. So conclusion 1: NO MATTER WHAT TV YOU PLAN TO BUY ON THE INTERNET, SEE IT FIRST IN A STORE NEAR YOU. Out of the box the picture looked washed out, jagged, and grainy. I watched that evening the NBA semis. I've tried quite likely all possible picture controls (I'm a techie, and I know what I'm doing). Picture quality has been bad particularly when the game was in play ie dynamic situations (the half time show, which is more a \"static\" situation, was barely bearable, never great). I've checked out also other channels (news, movies, etc) still the same. While it is possible that I got a lemon, I don't think so - the TV menu was crisp, clear, displaying true colors, but HDMI transmission from the U-verse box, was terrible. I changed 3 different HDMI cables, it did not help. The Panasonic was picked up about an hour ago - it goes back to amazon! I've not seen the refund yet, but amazon did not give me a hard time about the return.Delivery: Can write a novel, Pick-Up: can write a sequel. Coordination with Pilot Delivery was more painful than having a root canal. Listen to this: For the pick-up Pilot has sent one guy with a truck. While the TV is not particularly heavy, it is bulky b/c of its size. I had to help with  disassembly, picking and packing, otherwise the TV would have not made it back to the truck.So, now I went to the store (see conclusion 1, above), Sears to be specific. I saw side by side Samsung, Sharp, LG, Panasonic, and Sony. Conclusion 2: Plasma is inferior to LET-LCD, period. Plasma's picture is grainy, LED-LCD picture is so much better, colors really pop. Conclusion 3: Of all LED-LCD TVs Samsung has the best picture quality, period 2! Conclusion 4: The more you are willing to pay, the better picture quality. The Samsung D8000 (2012 model) will blow you away, D7000 (2011 model) is spectacular, and the D6000 is very good. The ES models (step down from the D-models) provide a reasonable compromise between picture quality and cost.BTW, all LG LED/LCD models, the pictures seemed dark and washed-out. Therefore, I'd never buy any LG. [I've read somewhere that LG is a supplier of LCD screens to other manufacturers, needs further investigation.] I've seen also side by side a Samsung LED-LCD and Visio M550SL at Costco, and to my big surprise Visio's picture quality was very close to the Samsung. The price difference is about $200-300.BTW 2, I have another LCD Samsung LN46xxx, which is about 4-5 years old (a plain vanilla 2D TV, but with 4 HDMI inputs, and is of course discontinued). It's excellent in every way, no problems at all. So I think I'll stick with Samsung. I'm considering now UN55ES6500 or 6580. I've had it with deliveries, I'll pay a bit more and buy at costco (it'll certainly be easier to return, if necessary).", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "65-inch Plasma display\nFull HD 3D; Infinite Black Pro Panel\nVera Connect Wi-Fi Built-In with Web Browser\n3D Real Sound\nTV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 59.4-Inch x 35.2-Inch x 2.1-Inch, TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 59.4-Inch x 37.2-Inch x 15.8-Inch", "Name": "Panasonic VIERA TC-P65ST50 65-Inch 1080p 600Hz Full HD 3D Plasma TV (2012 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sKPR7%2BgEL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00752VKBY"}}
