My HDD's are Phillips and they're awesome so I had hoped this TV would be too. This Phillips was meant to be the one I watched the most but 22\" was too small for that (bought a 26\" Vizio for that purpose) so it's been put to use in another room instead.I use this TV daily and coming from a CRT, WOW, there's a major difference in the picture. All the 1080 channels are just beautiful with crisp clear colors. Sound-wise though it could use a boost. I suggest adding external speakers to this unit because the speakers are in the back and aim upwards, so if you have it in a TV cabinet like I do, the sound will be too low in your average sized room.The remote and settings are intuitive and easy to use. The TV was easy to connect, lots of cable options (component, HDMI, etc.). I can say that even though I didn't need or want to replace my old TV I do not miss it. Even with wide screen everything, which for me, takes some getting used to, I'm liking this.I wish there were more reviews but I got a great price and so far am happy with this purchase.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Nice TV for the Price", "Author": "Jay Tee", "ReviewID": "R1X5XPT75Q6BV4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this TV unpacked, assembled, hooked up and working in less that 30 minutes. It went into a channel search automatically when turned on for the first time. The channel search required about half of the 30 minutes needed to get it going.I think the TV has a great picture and sound for a TV of this size and price. It was easy to assemble the stand with two screws and the channel setup was automatic after attaching the cable and plugging it in. After that you go thru a very easy procedure to adjust the picture settings to your requirements. That was it, nothing else required to make it operational and it's been working great since. Correction, you do need to insert the batteries into the remote and turn the TV on before the channel setup will start.There is one thing you need to know. The 22 inch model has only one HDMI connection, not three as stated on the web site. It appears you must buy the 26 inch model if you need more than one HDMI. I have no need for the one that it does have so I'm not down-rating the TV for this web site error.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "1 minor hiccup", "Author": "N.

So far the picture is great.  The speakers of the TV are pointed down and it seems since it is hanging on the wall the sound has nothing to bounce off of so it is very quiet.

Mertz", "ReviewID": "R147YP1WA7PA1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to go in my bedroom and connect to a Roku XD|S and I have to say it works great.  The picture is great, sound isn't what you'd expect from a stereo but it is quite good for TV speakers, the remote and menus are easy to use and understand, and the TV isn't heavy and quite thin.  For the price and size you can't find a much better TV.  (Note: I can't comment on the tuner function as I'm not using that but I don't see any reason why that would be a problem)I do want to add that when I first hooked this up I did have some frustrating issues with it constantly saying my Roku player was giving it a resolution that it could not support.  I was using the same HDMI cable that I was using to connect my Roku to a HANNSpree monitor which was working fine.  I also noticed that when I power cycled my Roku the TV would display the startup screen but once the menu loaded it gave me either the resolution error or a blue screen.  I tried adjusting every setting possible and was really close to giving up.  As a last ditch effort (and fullt convinced that it wasn;t going to help) I used another HDMI cable to go from the Roku to the new TV and amazingly that solved the problem.  It still kind of confuses me as to why the old HDMI cable worked fine going from my Roku to the HANNSpree but not to this Phillips TV but I don't see any way that this is the fault of the TV.  The old HDMI cable was a lighter weight and the only thing that I can assume is that since I am using conduit for the power and HDMI cable and the monitor had a thicker power cable than this TV does there is more interference in the conduit that affected the lighter weight HDMI cable.  Again, none of this is the fault of the TV but I wanted to add it in case anyone else ran into similar issues with this or another TV.  If you're having issues make sure you are using a heavy weight HDMI cable (you don't need to buy an expensive one, just one that has good insulation) and if you are running your HDMI cable and power cable in the same conduit try taking it out of the conduit just to verify before you blame the TV.Overall this is a great little TV for a bedroom and if you're looking for something in this size you'll be more than satisfied.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ideal Kitchen TV", "Author": "Brassbass \"Gardensmith\"", "ReviewID": "R3P9UWYLEL75CP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Phillips 22 inch TV is ideal for our galley kitchen.

In fact, I have to say that everything I've ever bought with the Philips and Magnavox name on it has performed flawlessly--and that goes back probably 20 years. I have not one single complaint in all those years. This TV has very good color fidelity and very good sound. My only issue is that the 22\" screen is a bit smaller than I was thinking (I bought it online without looking at one in a store--I hate store shopping) and so when I watch a letterbox dvd, it's smaller yet. Still, I think everything about this TV from set-up to image quality is super and I particularly like that it integrates so seamlessly with my Philps dvd player.The bottom line is that for under $200 (pretty far under $200 if you have Prime and don't have to pay shipping) this is a really good TV for a small bedroom. I've since replaced it with a larger TV (a 40\" Philips) but I'm thinking of putting this one in the kitchen to watch news while cooking.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "So good I am buying a second", "Author": "Edward Hayes \"mrfish\"", "ReviewID": "R1BP5ICWBJX7DK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a TV to up grade to, so I could watch my blue-ray DVD movies and Roku device on in high def.

Now, Philips isn't Samsung or Toshiba, but they have quality products, and I decided to go for it. The TV has good quality and isn't too large or heavy (it shouldn't be, it's a 22-inch after all) and was a perfect fit for my dorm room without being excessive or a pain to move around. Something I found pretty neat was the touch controls on front, which are nice and responsive, while the remote is fairly simple and easy to use as well. The sound is definitely adequate in small, quiet environments but in medium or large rooms it is somewhat lacking, as the speakers face upwards and slightly away from the viewer.Connections: The biggest problem with this TV is the lack of HDMI-supported PC connection. This TV is currently a secondary monitor for my laptop and works just fine, but it only connects with a VGA cable despite having an HDMI connection. This only works for auxiliary devices but I haven't had a problem with it so far. My Gamecube is also connected to it and works perfectly, but there aren't enough video/audio ports for anything else to connect. However, it does have a USB port for cameras and the such for slideshows, although I haven't used that yet. Also, it has a standard audio out jack in case you need to plug in headphones or external speakers (my computer speakers worked perfectly to watch the Super Bowl with awesome sound).If you're looking for a pretty good quality HDTV for a good price, then I would recommend it for sure. If you need one with PC connectivity via HDMI, then it might not be the best for you, but a VGA cable still works. All in all, a good TV.Edit: Well, here's to not testing things out and writing reviews on them. Turns out this TV does support HDMI connectivity with a computer, I just assumed it didn't because the description never explicitly stated so. It works just fine with my Dell Latitude XT3 and my friend's Fujitsu (some kind of lifebook convertible) so I assume it will work with the majority of them out there.

My original attraction to the brand was their reasonable price combined with quality pictures and sound, and they seem to continue to meet that standard.  On this model, I particularly like having touch controls on the front of the TV (convenient), the LED back lighting (longer life), a digital sound output (I attached it to  Logitech Z-5500 THX-Certified 5.1 Digital Surround Sound Speaker System), and the thin design with a small frame (less blocked visual space).  As another reviewer pointed out, this 22 inch model only has 1 HDMI input (Amazon, you should correct your ad, which says 3!!), but that was all that I needed, using it to provide an extra monitor for my computer. I'm  getting my HD TV inputs through the component connections from a TiVo 50 feet away, using a pair of baluns and cat 5 cable, which work great with this TV...this connection did not work with the previous Toshiba 24L4200U 24-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED TV (Black) I tried, and had to send it back to Amazon.  The fact this TV only offers 720p screen resolution is not a problem for me; even at the only 3 ft distance that I watch the TV, it is nearly impossible to distinguish it from 1080p on a 22 inch screen.  In addition, analog channels that I created for a 2nd TiVo and Roku, using an old video distribution system, are very clear and noise free, which may also be of interest to those that still get analog channels over cable.

It is still working fine today, after quite extensive daily usage.I was originally looking for a 20-22\" TV LED/LCD TV that could pull double-duty as both TV and computer monitor, and this was one of the few sets that I could find that still had a native headphone jack on the TV set (for viewing cable TV at a 8-12\" distance with wired headphones).  I never purchased a Philips product before, but decided to give it a try, and it has been a positive experience thus far.Not much to say about \"TV Mode\" really.  It works with cable TV in all the ways that it is supposed to work, and looks perfectly fine by 720p viewing standards - though you will need to play around with the various settings a bit to find the view setting that are best for you personally.I hooked this TV set up to my desktop computer via a DVI-D to HDMI cable, and had some problems at first.  My computer would not boot without my old \"screen dead\" LCD monitor still hooked up to my other DVI port (turned off or on).  This problem went away when I changed some settings in my desktop system BIOS, including disabling \"Windows 8 Secure Boot\" (which you would also have to disable to install Windows 7 on this system).  I'm not sure why this was a problem in the first place, but it shouldn't have been.  I was told by someone that if I also connect my secondary desktop DVI-I port to my VGA connector on my TV (in addition to my current DVI-D to HDMI hookup), that the computer would boot properly in \"Windows 8 Secure Mode\" with the TV, but I never tried that method yet.As a 720p computer monitor, this TV is perfectly fine if you don't mind using it mostly in its native 1366 x 768 resolution mode - since that is easily the \"cleanest resolution mode\" for viewing text without using windows to artificially magnify certain text.  Any other resolution that I use with this TV/Monitor is hard on my eyes, so I stick with 1366 x 768.  Even in games, higher resolutions like 1440 x 900, 1600 x 900, or 1920 x 1080 will make any display text more of a headache to look at, so keep that in mind.  On the bright side, even a current entry-level Geforce GTX 750 1GB video card can easily play any game at maximum-quality settings at 1366 x 768 resolution (or 1600 x 900 for that matter), with very high frame-rates. :)As a side note, you will have to set the contrast, brightness and viewing setting a bit different in \"computer monitor mode\" versus \"normal TV viewing mode\".  Once done, it will switch to those settings whenever you switch from TV to HDMI/Monitor mode.My only real complaints about this TV/Monitor thus far:(A) It has no tilt or swivel feature, so it limits your viewing aesthetics in that regard.(B) The native TV speakers, like in most TVs today, are quite weak and underwhelming, so you will have to hook it up to a stronger speaker/stereo system (or headphones) to maximize your listening pleasure.(C) The TV base feels sort of cheap/lightweight, and I'm not of fan of the glossy black plastic finish on the whole set overall.  A flat black matte finish would have been much nicer on this set.I hope that you found this review helpful.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "If I could give it a zero star, I would.", "Author": "Mjett", "ReviewID": "R2GB0SXXDAKN63", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Tv just quit working.

Well the tv didn't work, just had some weird color shapes.  We unplugged and reset it up again, still no luck.  The return through Amazon was great, I did tell them the condition it was delivered in was perhaps the reason it wouldn't work.

The TV simply DOES NOT WORK with the PS3's HDMI. Once I encountered the issue, my friend and I separately researched the problem and discovered that this is in fact a common issue encountered with Philips TVs and a host of HDMI devices, including the Apple TV. THE APPLE TV!Philips' support page even lists this as a \"Frequently Asked Question\", which should tell them something about their horrible product. (Needless to say, the solutions they presented were not, in fact, helpful in the slightest.)This is wholly and completely unacceptable. For Philips to make an HDMI product that cannot interface with numerous popular HDMI devices is quite simply baffling. And yes, the Playstation 3 and Apple TV are incredibly common. This is simply mind-blowing.Do not buy this product. An HDTV that completely and utterly fails to connect with mass-market HDMI devices from top-rated manufacturers is no HDTV at all. It is garbage. It is a waste of resources and time and money and I am diminished and robbed as a human for having dealt with it.Henceforth, I shall consider myself at war with the Philips corporation. That's how bad this is. They have no place in the mass-market electronics industry and the sooner they are purged from the Earth, the better we will all be for it.Go away, Philips. Just go away. Cease to exist. At once. You are bad people who make bad products and if you in fact do make any profit it is clearly obtained by deceiving customers with promises of products you have absolutely no idea how to make.In short, please die.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "LED\nDigital Crystal Clear\n1 HDMI\nSRS TruSurround\nDLNA", "Name": "Philips 22PFL4507 22-Inch 60Hz LED TV (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wRWAB6ZEL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007B5WJ1U"}}
