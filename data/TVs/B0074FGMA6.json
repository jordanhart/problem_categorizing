{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This TV is one of the best", "Author": "Corey Fisher", "ReviewID": "R3HUKO3O1QMA8E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from Amazon and received it the next day via UPS. I hooked it up and it works flawlessly. The set-up is amazingly simple, the TV is very easy to set up and put together. Everything is explained in detail and gives video demonstrations. I went ahead and calibrated the TV using a calibration DVD and the TV offers some of the most superb and realistic picture quality I have seen yet. The 3D is also much improved and it's nice they threw in 4 pairs of glases with it. I have found that if you follow the directions that they show you very clearly in the demonstrations and follow the process, the TV responds very accurately and very well. The motion controls are probably the only thing that needs a very little amount of work, but I mean, compared to a Kinect, it basically works the same way and is not more or less accurate then the Kinect, either. The TV's black levels are the best I have seen for an LED set, coming close to the best of Plaasma's, motion rate is extremely enhanced and 3D performance has no visible crosstalk or juttering as in old sets. All in all, this is the best performing and high-est tech TV set available. It's also extremely fast with the dual core processing, everything you do is a snap. Apps load very quickly, internet is decent and the TV responds well. I have not had any issues from a weeks use of the TV. It has worked flawlessly.***UPDATE*** after further testing I have found one flaw. The media hub works well, however, Netflix has an issue. It will only work half the time. Half the time it will not load a video and the TV will reset, the other half it works fine. I haven't lost any settings yet, however, it is annoying. I have reduced to 4 stars sInce it isn't the end of the world and will likely be fixed with a simple software update. I watch a lot of Netflix, so Samsung, I know you will read these first reviews. This software bug with Netflix needs to get fixed. I am an advanced tech lead for Sprint, I've already tried everything to T/S the issue and other people reviews state the same. However, my TV has not had its settings reset like others. This is my only small complaint, everything else works fine.***UPDATE #2*** There was some kind of update to the TV last night and the resetting seams to have stopped during Netflix and seams a bit more responsive, for now, but still not a guarantee that it's fixed. I'm not sure what kind of update it was because the damn TV is so fast, I didn't see it long enough before it was done. I'm pretty sure I will need to wait and test it more. However, it seams to have stopped. The other thing I have noticed is that the LED lights at the bottom of the screen in the middle seam brighter then the rest of the lights, but this is only noticeable in pure 100% darkness, which you'll see anyways, because it's still and LCD anyway you look at it. I have also purchased a PN51E8000 TV for downstairs, it appears that the PN51E8000 has much darker blacks in pure darkness, in fact, it's not far off from an OLED, however, I'll post a review of that one later.***UPDATE #3*** it appears that the reset issue with Netflix only appears when the smart hub has issues connecting with Samsung. I have noticed that on weekdays, it works fairly well and can connect to apps just fine. However, on weekends, it appears Samsungs servers can't currently handle the traffic as I seam to get \"network interference\" issues and most apps won't connect, even though my connection to the Internet is fine at 25mbps+ and when the apps are having difficulty and you try to get on Netflix, it has trouble playing videos and gets stuck and then resets. Other then these few small issues I have had with the TV and the connection to Samsungs media hub, I continue to be blown away by the stellar 3D, the ridiculous crispness of the picture and the smooth motion rate and I have gotten use to the voice commands. I was originally having problems with it recognizing my voice, but after turning down our fan in our room, it seams to recognize my voice very well now. So Samsung, hear me out... The network interference problems have to get resolved and Netflix needs to be updated so it simply rebuffed instead of turning off the TV. If this happens, I'll be a happy camper.***UPDATE #4*** alright Samsung techs, here's one for ya and even though this doesn't actually reflect my review of the TV itself, im not sure where the problem lays. I have an iPad as well as two iPhone 4s's, all running iOS 5.1. The iPhones work great with the remote control, they always find the tv and connect and work well. However, the iPad 2 Samsung remote does not work. It will work right when you connect and allow it, but as soon as you don't use it for awhile, it stops working and never reconnects, it gets an \"unknown network error\" and disconnects. I was so fixated on getting it fixed that I even hard reset my iPad 2 and reinstalled the app and it still does it. The only way I am able to use it is if I go into the TV settings to network all share and delete the iPad from the allowed list and re-add it, until it stops working again after I don't use it for awhile. Samsung, it is an absolute necessity that this is fixed ASAP!! I use my iPad to browse the net while I watch tv and having the Samsung remote on it to control the Tav is essential. I am a total multi tasker! Gosh I hope they read my post.***UPDATE #5*** the Netflix app has no reset now in almost two weeks and we watch Netflix almost on a daily basis... It has work flawlessly. The set seems to be performing much better after a few weeks break-in (normal). I think this a great set, but Samsung still needs to update the iPad remote app so it can actually work. I think this TV and PN51e8000 will be our last TVs for a few years until OLED TVs become mainstream in 2014-2015. Manufacturers say they will have mainstream 55inch sets for around $2k. Until then I might actually look into the evolution kits that will come out to upgrade its features, if they are a good price, I might pick one up. If not, then these will do until OLEDs are it.***UPDATE 6*** April 22nd, I have received another update and have had 0 problems with set since. I guess that fact it needed to break in held true. The TV has worked flawlessly, I can't imagine getting much better until OLED hits mainstream. The picture quality has increased as well with the update. The voice recognition now works a lot better, but if you have fans or kids or noise in general, it still has a hard time unless dead silent, but that would be expected.

We loved the TV, the picture was great, and running netflix without the xbox was nice.I've had this TV since March and all of a sudden it will start to power off. We have had the TV for about 5 months at this point and shouldn't be having this poblem. I contacted their support and did the usual troubleshooting. Reset the TV, changed some settings, checked for updates. All of which I did before but just did it to go through the process. I was on hold for while and during that time it wasn't turning off so I hung up. Well now it will not even stay on for 2-3 minutes then it just constantly turns off and on. I am hoping to get a new one and see how it goes. But I know for sure that I will not buy another Samsung TV. I have two other LED tv's in the house for years with no issues but different brands. Just very dissappointed in the qualitiy of the TV. Beware!", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Feature rich, but faulty tv and not intuitive", "Author": "Frequent Prime User", "ReviewID": "R1R5PTCLCRT89E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I own several Tvs including another samsung (which i like), and i'm pretty savvy at using them. This  tv is faulty and not intuitive.Why it is faulty (some of the issues):-Out of the box, AV technician had trouble connecting to internet (connected and then disconnected on it's own)-Attempted to set up remote to control STB (set top box). During 4 attempts, tv froze, restarted, and long delays of blanks screen-Often times when bringing up menu, there is a menu frame, but no text (e.g. a popup window with nothing inside)-Most notable, during regular tv viewing, without touching remote, TV turns off and on every 15 minutes. I thought this might be due to something triggering voice activation, but turned that off and problem still occurs. This is a dealbreaker - i don't think intentional, but the tv has an uncanny knack for turning off during climatic moments.-Several times the TV froze and i needed to unplug to reset.-controlling tv with hand gestures - after successfully going thru hand gesture set up process, could not get it to work and at one point I thought I might be on candid camera as I sat waving at my TV. Perhaps this is user error, but if it is this difficult to use, i'm not interested.-i reset the tv thru the menu options and also checked for software updates - it said i have most recent softwareWhy is not intuitive?-this more difficult to articulate, but i found it overwhelming and confusing to figure out the features. I didn't even attempt to use the 3D. The instruction manual is not very helpful. There is an online user guide, but i didn;t find that very useful either. My best advice would be to visit a store where this tv is on demo and try it out.-it comes with 2 remotes and an IR booster to allow you to control other devices. One of the remotes has a touchpad which enables you to manipulate the tv screen by swiping. This seemed to work only on certain screens so i found myself switching between remotes. And this is by no means a slick apple touchpad.-voice control - we did get this to work, but i didn't find it useful. You must start voice activation by saying \"Hi TV\" and then you can say things like \"Volume Up\"  \"Volume Down\" \"TV Off' - but if there is background noise, you may have to repeat your self. there is also a mic in the touchpad remote which does work, but then you need to have the remote in your hand anyway. However, the touch pad remote is not easy to use, so you may prefer voice commands while using that remote. You can also voice activate \"MOre Commands\" and go things like \"Samsung Apps\", but these features then require the remote to take action, so the voice commands have limited use. Again, nice idea, but it reminds a little bit of VIC, the voice controlled vette that came out in the late 70s (see here [...]-hand gesture - as mentioned, i could not get it to work. The tv displays a hand icon to indicate when hand gesture is available, but i waved and nothing happened.-menus - the menus are busy and there is a lot of drilling down. With 4 different ways to navigate them (2 remotes, hand and voice) i still found it hard to find anything.this is a brand new model - my sense is that it was rushed to market.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung is a joke!  ZERO Support!", "Author": "J. Emlay", "ReviewID": "RAYCLQBOQ5WXX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wrote a review for the Evolution Kit and my horrible experience that followed after trying to install it.  I'll just cut and paste from that review:EDIT 6\\6\\2013So.....after having this device for a few days I came to discover that my TV wouldn't turn on. Press the power button and I hear a click come from the TV (normal) but then you hear another click right away and the TV remains off. I figured the last thing I did to my TV was install the evolution kit so I removed it and my TV turns on again. Install the kit and again the TV would not turn on. So this unit is now dead. It also seems to have killed my TV because now my RVU client will not work. Any content I play from my genie DVR will play for about 10 seconds then the entire TV will just freeze. So now my evolution kit and TV are dead.I contacted Samsung support and the person I chatted with was completely useless. The end result was my case being escalated to someone else and I was told they would be contacting me in 2-3 days. Yeah, that was OVER A WEEK AGO. I contacted them again and was told to keep waiting, they'll get to me when they get to me.Well, the device was great when it worked. However in the end it ruined my TV and I'm now left sitting in the dark with zero support.All stars removed for having the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Also if this device has the ability to physically harm the TV itself then it's just not worth it in my opinion. If they stood by their product and responded to service then ok, but they don't and now I'm screwed. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some books to buy since TV is not on my todo list anytime soon.EDIT 6\\11\\2013After 2 weeks of waiting I contacted Samsung again and raised hell! They basically told me there was nothing they could do for me. They simply did not have anyone available to help me. That is complete garbage! So they redirected me to a local TV shop and told me to have them fix it. Since it was under warranty they would have to handle it. So now I have to drive 40 miles round trip (probably twice) to get this sorted out with someone else. They didn't even set me up with them. Just gave me a number and told me to call them and to do it myself.This is the first and last time I will ever be a Samsung customer. Vizio treats their customers much better and with a lot more respect.EDIT 6\\19\\2013Contacted the TV Shop that Samsung told to me to deal with and they refuse to help me. They said they wont touch the evolution kit at all and since I installed the evolution kit then my broken TV is my problem.Still no response from Samsung at all! Called them again and again I was told there is nothing they can do. They will get to me then they get to me. Told them about my experience with the 3rd party vendor and they couldn't care less. So now I've had a dead TV and a dead evolution kit for over 3 weeks now.Samsung is a joke!EDIT 07/9/2013FINALLY got my TV fixed. That only took what? 7 WEEKS!!!! Not to mention a whole lot of upset calls to Samsung. However, I still have a broken Evolution kit. They keep bouncing me around from department to department because no one knows anything about this product. Two people told me, after I gave them the model number (SEK-1000), that it was NOT a Samsung model number. Then another person told me that the serial number I gave them was no good.Wow....just....wow!But no worries, someone will call me in 2-3 days.....someone just shoot me now.EDIT 08/15/13FINALLY!!!! After 10 weeks Samsung has finally sent me a replacement. Installed it and everything seems fine again.....for now. Oh, btw...no one ever called me 2-3 days later. I got the replacement after 2 more phone calls that I had to make. Like I said before, this is my last Samsung product, ever! If this thing breaks again then I'm getting rid of it. Hell, I might sell it right now as every time I look at it I get a bad taste in my mouth.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wish I could say yes", "Author": "Peter Foti \"Pete\"", "ReviewID": "R1B3F197JMDTSG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is our second high end Samsung.

Bad capacitors", "Author": "Scott Draper", "ReviewID": "R2P8KOKVDIK2HB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought in late August. All well, for a month.  Then it starts clicking on and off at random.  It gets worse and worse. Now it runs for a couple of minutes at best and then...click, click, click.  Nothing. Samsung help desk was very kind and polite. They happily tried hard reboots and so on. Then they decided to send a repair person, free.  The repair person ordered a power supply and motherboard. They're on their way.Why is Samsung so understanding and eager to send free repair people, I ask myself? So I do a little investigation on Google.  Try \"Samsung bad capacitors\" and the problem I describe is there. It's been going on for years. Theres a big class action lawsuit and expensive settlements. Apparently Samsung uses cheap Capxon capacitors and they overheat and the design of the TVs puts additional heat on them without effective cooling.I'm not optimistic that a new motherboard and power supply with the same capacitors will fix anything for long. I'm going to learn to solder so I can buy some better capacitors to install myself. That seems to be an effective fix for some. Do you want to solder your $2000 TV?  I didn't think so. I bought a lemon. Buyer beware. Last Samsung product I'll buy.If the new boards work, I'll upgrade my review and eat my hat.

After several repair attempts, it was replaced with a brand new 46ES8000 2012 model. Here is what i think of it, It has a beautifull picture and plenty of features very few tvs have. The motion and voice control work fairly well but should not be the reason you are buying this tv. Thankfully it can be turned off and its what i did since its not something i care for. All that matters to me is PICTURE QUALITY, and yet again samsung does not dissapoint in that department. BEAUTIFULL colors and jaw dropping details BUT it does have some bright spots particularly in the corners and bottom of the screen during dark scenes. Some  sets are worse than others though,so if you get one that has that it can be very ANNOYING! you might want to try and exchange it for a different set(unless that sort of thing doesnt bother you) Its what i did and the second tv looks great! very little or no bright spots in dark scenes. I do like the smart hub in this 2012 tv because its nice and crisp. full HD apps and internet streaming videos. Youtube is one of my favorites, along with VUDU and netflix. They all have amazing quality. 3D looks great as well! you will defenatly appreciate the upgrade. tv comes with 4 pairs of 3D glasses and two remote controls which is awesome. Overall im loving this new tv and cant wait for the evolution kit to hit the stores this year.This model can be upgraded through the evo kit for up to 4 years! Just remember to buy extended warranty for an investment such as this. You need to make sure you are covered incase something goes wrong.(knock on wood) I speak from experience! lol Check out Costco.com, they offer 3 years of extra coverage through Square Trade for only $99! No membership required, a total of 4 years with the 1yr mnr. Hell of a deal and worth every penny for peace of mind. these 8000 series tvs are beautifull but also very fragile. make sure YOU ARE PROTECTED! :)UPDATE, 3/13/2013I upgraded from a 46\" to a 55\" ES8000 because prices have gone down drasticly!I was lucky that it happened during the first 30 days of purchase and i was able to exchange it at Fry's who priced matched Amazon.com. THANK YOU Fry's!!lol It was a great deal without question and i must say the 55 ES works beautifully!Alot better than the way the 46 ES performs. I give it a 5 stars! no clouding or backlight bleed thanks to the latest Firm Ware 1047 from samsung. A great buy, and i recommend to anyone debating on waiting for the F8000 or purchasing the ES which are at around $1800 right now on Amazon. You can always upgrade to the latest 2013 software with the Evolution kit comming out next month. Just remember to still purchase warranty for it. :)UPDATE, 4/22/2013Samsung just released another firmware update for the ES8000 called 1048 a couple of days ago, and it has improved picture quality. The ES8000 finaly looks almost as it was intended, with inky blacks and sharp contrast without the excess backlight bleed. It looks AMAZING! i also noticed less picture noise when playing a bluray thanks to the update. This baby is still working excellent and i hope it stays that way for a long time. I doubt i will invest in the now called \"smart evolution kit\" as it is not mention at all by Samsung if it will improve PQ anywhere except for speed perfomance in smart hub. if by anychance i do buy it,(when the price drops) i will be sure to review and give my thoughts on it.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "1500 dollar tv that has had 6 issues in 1 week, piece of junk", "Author": "Blazergirl", "ReviewID": "R13IX7GSB30CDT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Since day 1 I have had nothing but problems with this tv , it has alot of advanced features but I think they went to far , it shuts off whenever it wants , then it wont shut off, the picture is awesome when its not acting up, but I have some kind of problem with this tv everyday , wish I never bought it , I am a technical engineer and I know how this tv works , my last comment it pulled this on us last night , it shut off then on , off on off on kept going for 10 minutes finally I unplugged it , plugged it back in still same problem I had to reset the entire tv then reset everything whick takes an hour , not happy with this tv AT ALL, now im 4 weeks in and the tv is totally unusable, horizontal and vertical color bars, officially the worst electronics purchase ive ever made, this tv is an absolute piece of CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this TV and since I own this TV and had 4 of them with all having different problems, now I can see why Cnet only rated this 3 stars. I also own the UnD8000 from last year and the picture on that TV is so much better and way better black levels. This TV is not an upgrade to last years. Its actually worse than the past few years high end models.There seems to be a problem also with the \"Micro Dimming Ultimate\" not working right now and Samsung is Aware of it and is not doing anything about it. The whole point in me buying this over the 7500, 0r 7100 was because of this Micro Dimming Ultimate. This is supposed to give the TV better black levels. Well, This TV has good grey levels, but not black.  I think the blacks were even blacker before Samsung sent out a Firmware Update. Maybe they downsized the picture quality on this TV so people will spend $10,000 on their new 75ES9000 coming out soon.Edit- another Firmware and Smart hub update was sent and ever since, one of my sets has burn in now. If buying this TV, make sure you buy an extended warranty, and once you get it, Enable the Cal/Day and Cal/Night modes so these updates won't effect your picture or panel.I have had this TV since the the first day it was released. Actually, I had 4 different one's and I finally received one that was better than the other 3 so I kept it. Looking back now, I wish I returned it and bought the Sony or Panasonic because I highly doubt this TV will even last to be able to use the Revolution kit this TV has so you can upgrade it.Cnet gave this TV 3 stars out of 5. Why spend all this money for this TV when you can own a 5 star TV for less which also has better reliability according to Consumer R. My final advise, STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG THIS YEAR!Just got this TV yesterday and I highly recommend you don't get it. The same problems with the 2011 D8000 LED are still here with this new ES8000. My LN46C530 from 2010 looks better than this 2012 ES8000 crap! I tried to set up the gesture control and it kept asking me to wave my hand in front on camera for a few times. I did that, but it kept saying I didn't pass the test to use the gesture. I haven't tried anything else yet as I bought this TV for the supposedly \"better than last years\" picture quality so once I realized its even worse, I gave up on everything else.I have tried everything to get the picture to look decent. I even tried using 3 different HDMI cables and connecting the HD cable box directly to the TV and not through my Onkyo receiver. The movie setting looks horrible. All the settings look horrible. The same thing is happening where a dark scene shows the bleeding backlight and all kinds of lines. Kinda like clouds in the background. Sorry, Im just trying to describe this as best as I can. The TV comes with this small wireless strange shape thing to connect your cable box to the tv so you can program the TV remote to change channels with the Samsung remote and it doesn't even turn on. I have changed batteries twice and still dead. Dead on arrival!The touch remote is ok and the other \"basic\" remote that comes with it is long and bulky and just like the 2009/2010 models. It is Basically just another cheap Samsung product. I bought this TV hoping it will have excellent picture quality. Better than my 2011 D8000 and it's so upsetting that its worse. I didn't mind paying the $2,600 so long as it has the Ultimate PQ. I didn't buy this LED for all the bells and whistles.Looks like this TV is just another one of the Millions of Samsung's TV's being retuned left and right for BAD QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES!SHAME ON YOU SAMSUNG!!", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good image, not that good sound", "Author": "Rodolfo Luis Gameros Leal", "ReviewID": "R2P053TG1PJYX1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is ok, though I received it with a stuck pixel that I cannot get fixed and cannot return... :( I pay enough money to expect this.

I would get a Samsung 50 or 55\" with no SmartTV.I find the delay to the \"smart tv\" section to be slow.  And the amazon wireless shows would hang when my wife watched Downton Abbey...which is not good :)Anyway I solved it by buying a cisco wireless extender and plugged it into the back of the tv.  It shouldn't have made a difference since it's sitting right next to the TV's wireless receiver ...but  it worked.Other than that, it auto detected stations (digital and otherwise).  However many of the stations were blank, duplicates or stations I don't like (like horse racing).  It's not easy to manually remove a station.  You have to go into the smart tv section, go to channel and check-box (b) one or more items.

No tax either. Also since I am a prime member I got the TV in two days for free. I love this tv. there aren't alot of apps yet. But if you have netflix and/or hulu it is worth it. I would recommend getting a 3d bluray player because I do have problems streaming 3d at certain times through vudu. vudu blames my internet connection but I have adsl 10 mbs and I ran a tracert and it is a problem with them. I work on electronics for a living so I don't have outrageous expectations for products like most do. This is a new tv and it will take awhile before they get the bugs worked out. The tv does show a little extra light on the corners but its not a big deal. You can't even notice unless you try. You can put the tv in movie mode if you are watching in the dark and you won't see it. The 3d is amazing. really. you can plug any usb device up to it and watch shows you have on them and you can stream from your computer. The speech is a little off. It prefers my wife's voice over mine. We have a loud AC and I am blaming it. But this tv does get updates and I can upgrade it in the future. This is the first tv to allow you to upgrade the hardware which to a tech is extraordinary. I don't have to buy a new tv every 5 years to keep up with the jones's. I would reccomend this tv to anyone. 2 years to pay it off without incurring a charge is really cool. Netflix needs the sound up all the way to hear it.

Seems with the Amazon nannies you get a star just for showing up. I guess their margin is the same regardless ... I digress.After only a few months, it's failed catastrophically: All it does is \"click-click\" every several seconds (power relay to the display and/or the LED array). No picture whatsoever. It's but a giant, expensive paperweight.Further research indicates that the likelihood of this or some other failure happening to you is very high. Search around, and you will discoverBeyond the near-infant mortality, the so-called \"Customer Service\" at Samsung is at best hapless. The toll-free number approach is the first example of failure: you will get no help, issued a number, and told that someone may contact you within 2 business days. This doesn't happen. You can call every 2 days, and wait again, and again, and again ...Then there is the register your product at Samsung approach, which in theory is supposed to allow you to open a service request. If you have any open tickets (albeit, unaddressed) for a given item, their web site will not allow this alternative avenue to obtain service. Same applies to sending e-mail for a service request.Then there is chat: The absolute most product-ignorant people I've ever encountered are at the centers where Samsung chat is managed. DO NOT USE SAMSUNG CHAT: It is a form of temporal suicide. You will get nowhere, and it will take you a very long time to get there. You will be insulted with several questions surrounding whether the unit is plugged in or not. The delays in response are unbelievable, and responses border on the ridiculous - if comprehensible at all. This adds up to my guess that the folks at the call center(s) are not English speakers(using online translators) and that they are present only to passivate customers, which is ironic, in that it only frustrates and angers them further.It turns out that in the US - Samsung doesn't service anything. They have contracted 3rd party organizations to do this. These TVs are not washing machines; the mere act of opening one up WILL result in a severely abbreviated lifetime of the product due to the uncaring, under-trained (and certainly not by Samsung) staff whose only job performance criteria is how quickly they turn out \"repairs\".You're probably wondering, \"why did they buy this?\" (NOTE: Purchased from Amazon - can be verified). This TV had the best picture of all LED backlit TVs I'd evaluated. Color accuracies and ability to fine tune (or even calibrate) were as appealing as picture quality. Slide shows on it were impressive. Would have gone plasma, but really wanted to move to something more efficient, and mercury-excited fluorescence for backlighting is not only short lived, but a real hazard that most seem to disregard for \"efficiency\".
