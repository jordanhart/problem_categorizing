Conversations with tv-guys made me think that I needed to pony up for a 1080, but I just could not justify the premium over the 720p.  Now that I have it, I am glad I saved my money.  The picture quality is great, both in high def and for normal (low def?) viewing.  Whenever I have guests and the TV is on, they are blown away by the quality and ask my questions about it.I also like the anti-glare screen.  At first I was a little concerned that the anti-glare picture would look \"dull\" compared to your average plasma, but that is no longer a concern - it looks great.Another big plus for me was the appearance of the TV.  Like other Panasonic models, this TV is sleek.  Vizio and other manufacturers seem to incorporate larger speakers that look clunky in comparison.  The size of the tv relative to the picture size is great - looks nice on the wall, and doesn't take up any more room than it needs to.In fact, the reason why I am writing this review is because I am going to buy another one for a different room in the house.  Panasonic has definitely won my repeat business with this one - I think that says it all.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best value for the money", "Author": "Steve R", "ReviewID": "R3FKKZL7L96FFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You really can't go wrong purchasing this TV. Don't base your decision directly on the Cnet review and instead head over to AVSForum. You'll find a 80+ page thread with numerous reviews done by experts in the field. All of which are very positive and explain why CNet's review isn't too reliable.Unlike Panasonic's earlier model, the 77U, this TV has an excellent picture right out of the box. There's no need for an expensive calibration or messing with service menu's. I've found my favorite settings, thanks to someone on AVSForum, is:Picture Mode: CinemaPicture: 84Brightness: 40Tint: -2Sharpness: 50Color Temp: WarmColor mgmt: offx.v.Color: offVideo NR: offMPEG NR: offBlack Level: lightYou'll find a ton of other settings there too so just do a google search.This TV also seems very reliable. Out of over 3000+ posts I only saw maybe three that were returned due to a serious failure. (All of which were promptly replaced/repaired) Panasonic also has a really cool warranty service called \"Panasonic Concierge\". You can schedule service calls online and you'll be contacted within 24 hours. You can also call or chat online with a rep if you've got any questions. Another great thing about them is that if your TV fails and they have to take it away for repair they give you a loaner TV! I sure wish I had that option with my old Philips.I was first considering purchasing a Samsung LCD but decided to see both first hand in the store. After adjusting the settings on both TV's the Samsung had a very unnatural and bright image while the Panasonic looked as if you were looking out the window. While this sort of thing boils down to what type of picture you prefer I personally was sold on the Panasonic.Off topic, Amazon rocks too. After buying the TV their price dropped by a lot. I requested a refund for the difference and they did it no questions asked. I got the money back within 3 days!

Cobb", "ReviewID": "R3NHPJZT9PTKW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a few months reviewing plasmas and lcd's both in the big box stores and online.  I watch a lot of sports, and the lcd's still have the motion blurring problem (except the expensive new ones).  For me, that narrowed it down to the plasmas.  Like others have said, the Panasonic's stood out from the rest of the plasma's (except for Pioneers, but they are almost double the cost).  In terms of 1080 and 720 plasmas, I could not tell a difference between the two in 42\".  Maybe a little in the larger sets, but not in this size.  Not worth the extra cost IMHO.  So, I finally took the plunge on Panasonic's 720 42\" when the price dropped below $1000, no tax, free shipping.  A great deal for a TV that has been on the market for less than 2 months.Delivery on the TV was fast (about 5 days early).  They called a day ahead and delivered it within 1/2 hour of their estimated arrival.  They made sure that the TV worked, and offered to take away all the packaging material.  A+.The TV was a snap to set up--10 minutes.  The first thing that I noticed was that the color contrast is excellent, even on SD- much better then our 6-year-old Toshiba 27\" tube TV.  The clarity varies by station- a function of the channels, not the TV.  SD = A-The picture quality really excels while playing DVDs through component video.  Deep rich blacks, vivid colors.  The \"Planet Earth\" series looks incredible.  We have not hooked it up to HD yet, but I'm sure it will be even better.  A+.A nice feature is that the TV remembers your settings for each video input.  I.e.--we programmed a different color contrast for broadcast TV and DVDs and it stores each separately.  There are more than enough ways to adjust picture quality to really fine tune it.The audio is better than other sets, but not great.  We don't use it though, since the TV is hooked up through a 5.1 receiver.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, both the TV and Amazon's delivery service.  Definitely would buy it again.FOLLOW UP:  I just got HD, and it is even better than I could have imagined.  I don't even like NBA basketball, but I found myself glued to the playoff game just to see the clarity.  UFC was almost TOO clear for comfort.

Panasonic was *very* responsive.  I filed a request for service at their online site.  Within 24 hours, they contacted me to arrange a service appointment.  The service person arrived when arranged, replaced one of the video boards quickly and without charge.  It is possible that the problem was not with the board at all, but simply a cable connector that had not been seated properly at the factory.

I will research every possible source until I am satisfied with my decision to purchase. I originally set out to purchase an LCD and gave little thought to Plasma as I considered it an aged technology, but after researching and listening to plasma owners, former LCD owners and many high end reviews i couldn't ignore it. In my final stage I made 5 trips to the store and watched TV for a couple hours bouncing back & forth between various sets. In the end the Panasonic won out for a few reasons. First of all the store puts everything on vivid and this drives me nuts! I reached up and set the Panasonic to standard setting and it was beautiful. I then noticed how soothing and rich the picture looked compared to some of the harshly lit, overly bright LCDs. I already knew that Panasonic has had many generations of plasma and were good at it so I brought it home. Once in the home it was sweet out of the box. It was important that it display standard definition programming well as that isn't going away to soon. I am a sports buff and motion blur on some of the LCDs is annoying. This plasma does it all good.  I don't know if CNET and a couple other reviewers got bad sets or what, but I find that it has NO noise problem?

Word \"Bozack69\"", "ReviewID": "R3KXE5GRTTRW5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After two months of comparing models & prices, reading internet reviews, and visiting stores for hours of free viewing, I finally decided on purchasing the Samsung 42\" plasma, due to the family's budget.  Sadly my bedroom's 32\" Olevia LCD died in about 15 months, so I really did my homework this time. Unfortunately, my decision to buy was during the no-tax weekend, and the local BB was like a human feeding frenzy.  However this particular day turned out to be advantageous.  So anyway, I'm standing in front of the Panasonic 42\" Viera and absolutely loving the picture quality! The Samsung and the LG both looked great also, but the Panasonic was noticeably better. The store clerk interrupts me and asks if I'm ready to purchase. I said yes, but informed him that since my \"out-the-door\" budget was under $1K, I wanted the $897 Samsung. The Panasonic's price tag was $998 + 9.9% state tax.  After checking for availability, he returned and sadly said they were out of the Samsung models until around August 11th.  After seeing my reaction, he said; let me talk to my manager. He returned and said, my mgr will not only give you the Panasonic for the price of the Samsung, but you will also receive 10% off! Unbelievable! So I ended up paying $970 out the door!  This plasma looks & feels like pure quality! Even the way it's boxed. The set up was a breeze, and within 15 minutes, we were watching an up conversion of the Matrix. What an experience! This was absolutely the most awesome picture and sound. After about 4 hours of viewing, I felt the rear of the TV, and it was warm to the touch. Not hot like my 32\" LCD. Plus I didn't hear any buzzing sounds emitting from the rear, unlike some owners have noted. So here's my take on the Panasonic TH-42PX80U:Likes:1. Setup is extremely easy. The stand or mount attaches in about fifteen minutes.2. Sexy and sleek body. The black gloss and mirrored bottom strip looks futuristic.3. Very informative and easy to read Owner's Manual. (plenty of picture guides!)4. Auto tuning was excellent. The Panasonic picked up 16 digital and 4 HD channels with a standard pair of rabbit ears!5. Picture quality is excellent. Very deep blacks and the colors are crisp, clear and vibrant. (especially the reds, greens and yellows) Absolutely NO GHOSTING!6. Hi-Def is a sight to behold! Like night and day when compared to my 4 yr old DLP! Also, my Toshiba 1080i HD-DVD movies look awesome! No need to buy a Blu-Ray player........yet.7. The sound is great! Loud and crisp! No need to hook up a separate receiver, unless you opt for a sub-out. (I love a deep bass)8. Standard definition looks great via the Direct receiver.9. (3) HDMI ports, (3) component out, (1) optical, an SD slot, and (2) svideo. (for those who still own a VCR)10. The remote control is very simple, easy to use, and the buttons are large and clearly labeled.11. Panasonic's In-Home Concierge Program. You get your own personal 1-800 number for support issues.12. Panasonic's awesome new plasma technology almost completely eliminates the worries of burn-in & IR (image retention) issues.13. On-screen component labeling. (ie: DVD, VCR, DVR, etc.)14. The anti-glare screen.15. TV turns itself off, in case you fall asleep while watching.16. Picture quality gets better after initial 100 hr break-in.17. My wife loves it!Dislikes:1. None except the 100 hr break-in period. I can't wait to really see what this plasma is capable of!  Please go view the Panasonic and compare it with the others.  The  picture quality will convince you that Panasonic is one of the leading plasma producers as it relates to quality, design, technology, and dependability. I promise it will literally blow you away! I'm really glad I decided to purchase the Panasonic instead of the Samsung. Besides, what's spending an extra $100 compared to getting what you really want?  In fact, I'm so pleased with this television, that I'm seriously considering not investing in the $200 extended warranty.

As far as the TV goes the black levels are incredible as well as color and there is a discernable difference in the brightness level from past Panasonic plasma models. Since I dont watch much TV during daytime in my bedroom, ambient light is not an issue so plasma is the obvious choice (better picture than LCD).

Excellent price!Cons: Not 1080p.  Could use more inputs on the rear.  Not enough picture adjustment options for the hardcore hdtv lover (enough for me though!).I purchased the TH42PX80U for a few reasons: #1. Panasonic quality.  They have been an industry leader in plasmas for a few years now.  I have 3 friends with Panasonic plasmas (each purchased 3 years ago) and the displays look great, no problems ever reported.  #2. Customer service.  I have heard good things about Panasonic's customer service and their \"Plasma Concierge Service\" that is included really top notch.  If you should ever have a problem they are promptly at your doorstep and will repair or replace asap.  #3. Price.  I could not believe a Panasonic 42\" plasma was/is going for under $700!Since receiving the TV over one month ago, I have been pleased with the HD picture as well as the SD picture.  Some channels are better than others with their HD content (NBC is notoriously bad) and some of the local cable commercials seemed a bit fuzzy but the tv programs themselves have looked great.  The sound is good.  I do not have a surround sound system (much to my dismay) but am content (being on a student budget) with the sound produced by the speakers on this television.  I had no problems setting up the remote with my Comcast cable box although I cannot figure out how to change the aspect ratio using my Comcast remote.I have been using Nintendo Wii and the tv does an admirable job of handling all colors and motion.  Some people fear plasmas and video game use due to the potential for burn-in.  With this model tv that is not really an issue.  There are settings in the menu to help prevent burn-in as well as a white screen wipe that gets rid of any burn-in that may occur from having static images on screen for too long.  Also, for video game players, there is a GAME setting that helps further prevent burn in.  It's a nice \"set it and forget it\" kinda option.  Very user friendly.On the downside, I feel adding an HDMI port to the front of the tv is almost pointless.  Using inputs in the front of the tv are typically, at least for me, done as a quick and dirty way to watch something.  Typically I use it to attach a video camera or if a friend brings a video game system over we may use the front inputs.  There are only 2 HDMI ports in the rear so once you attach your cable box and Blu Ray or upconverting DVD player, you are tapped out of HDMI ports in the rear.  There is a third port in the front but using that at all times looks rather tacky in my opinion.  But, for the price, this is an extremely minor complaint.  I guess if someone were to be using 3 HDMI ports at all times, they probably would be getting a higher end TV anyway thus making my point moot.Also there are just a small handful of picture adjustment options.  For the average user, this is just fine and the picture looks quite good right out of the box.  I am content with the amount of adjustments available.  Of course, a hardcore hdtv lover may not feel that the adjustments are enough for his/her liking.  But, for those of us looking for a great picture with minimal tweaking, the adjustment options on this tv are fine.Thus far I am enjoying the tv.  Granted, this review has been written after only 1 month of use so take it for what it is worth.  One last tip for all you new HDTV buyers, make sure that you use HDMI cables as much as possible.  Using those old red-white-yellow a/v cables give you a rather junky picture.  You will definitely notice a huge difference in picture quality by upgrading to some inexpensive HDMI cables (and don't pay for the big name HDMI cables like Monster, a $6 cable will work just as well).Enjoy!**UPDATE** 1 year of solid use and this tv still looks as good as the day I purchased it.  No buyer's remorse here.  Friends and family have all enjoyed the tv and I undoubtedly would look to Panasonic the next time I think of purchasing an hdtv.**ANOTHER UPDATE** Over 3 years of use and the tv still looks great.

Sure enough, this model was it.  After reading numerous reviews, mostly outstanding, I ordered one for my parents on Black Friday.  Completion of shipping took total of 7 business days with telephone confirmation from the shipping company 1 hour prior to the actual delivery time.This was the third large HDTV box I've unpacked.  Compared to Samsung, this is easier to unpack, IF you read the instruction printed on the box by the handle.  Pull the tab to remove the handles on all four of time, then simply lift the box to see the TV inside.TV is inside the plastic cover, with the base and the instruction booklet on each side of the TV itself.  Placing TV onto the base is best done by reading the instruction booklet (and not the little diagram on the screws), attach the metal rods onto the base, then gently guide down the TV into the rod, apply the screws supplied.Once TV is turned on, you are greeted with few menus to set the Language, Clock, and scan the channels (took about 10 minutes to complete the analog cable and digital cable [Clear QAM]).  This area had local channels and few cable channels, such as Discovery HD and ESPN HD unscrambled.  You can choose to just use the channels it scanned, or edit the channel list, name each channel accordingly.I dropped down the Brightness, Color and Contrast setting by few notches from its factory setting of 50 (middle), and started browse the channels.Analog (non-HD) channels look pretty good.  As expected, some fuzziness was noted, but it was nicely blended, and none of blockiness often found on many LCD TVs.  All those ticker tapes were clearly visible with no streaking or stuttering.HD channels are where this TV shines.  I watched Discovery's \"Time Warp\", and the image was crystal clear, with no blurriness noted.  This programming had frequent change between super-slow-motion shots and fast action shots, and it was simply outstanding.Today being Monday, there were lots of new release commercials including \"The Dark Knight\".  All those dark sceneries were appropriately represented, with dark area looking very dark (almost true black), and it was NOT simply smeared with indifferent shapes of gray.I proceeded to try SD Card slot for pictures.  Pictures were taken from Canon Powershot SD450 into SD Card (Not SDHC), and there were notable loading time in between the pictures.  I am not sure if it's due to slow speed of the SD Card itself or the TV taking its time.Plugged PS3 into the TV via HDMI.  Fast pacing games were all nice and smooth, and color were nicely represented.  Blu-Ray movie I tried was \"Bladerunner\" and it was as good as I can remember.  Yet another dark scenes, the distinction between truly dark place and dark place was clear without being artificial.Sound from the TV speaker is adequate.  I feared it would be too low volume, but it was more than enough to fill the living room.  It cannot be substituted for a dedicate surround sound system, but for casual viewing, it will do the job.One oddity, is that if channel scanner detects multiple channels within the digital frequency (in my case, FOX HD and ABC HD under channel 1-5), it can only recognize one on the favorite channel list, and not both.  Temporary solution I have found is to use favorite channel on one of them, then use Channel Up/Down button to pick the other one.  It is strange experience to remind myself to do so.LCD has progressed steadily over last few years, but I will put my money on Plasma when it comes down to picture quality even today.  Also, 720p/1080p debate is moot point when the screen is 42\".

Whereas the manufacturer recommends about 100hrs break-in period, I have seen a huge improvement in picture quality since just in the last 24hrs. Of course, I put the TV on a channel that doesn't constantly show their logo and left it on the whole day while I was at work. Regular standard signal looks very clean for an HD TV set. Its not too grainy at all. HD signal over the air looks sharper. I matched it with a sony upconverting DVD player hooked via HDMI and the sound and image quality is superb. It upconverts automatically to 1080p. This TV has an optical out so you can get the best digital TV sound to your receiver. The one HD station I received broadcaseted in Dolby digital. I picked this set after weeks of research from which I concluded that for a 42 inch TV, you really won't see a difference between 720p vs 1080p. And an added advantage is that 720p looks nicer if you have standard signal for your tv. For those who are picky - the remote looks ugly but it works. Don't waste your money paying the store $300 to \"callibrate\" your tv. It looks just fine from the store and you can either use preset picture modes or play around with the 'custom' until you're satisfied. Plasma is the best choice! At the store, brighter isn't always better - when comparing plasma vs LCD. Plasma has deeper blacks and more natural colors. Great value - got mine at Best Buy for $999.UPDATE -1yr of ownershipI still love my TV. Purchased a better HGTV antenna (Terk) so I'm able to watch all locall HDTV signals for free. Boy is HD superb! Added a blu ray machine to my system. Using a PS3, the picture is so amazing that now I really hate watching DvDs on my TV. I used to be very skeptical but now I'm a huge fan of blu ray. I ignored the instructions, and set up my PS3 to send a 1080p signal to the TV. Image looks superb although this is only a 720p TV. I can't decide whether HDTV is sharper than Blu ray...which is a good thing because either is miles ahead of DvD signal.No problems with this TV at all. Blacks are blacker than ever.

I have also noticed a tendency to gush about whatever TV has been purchased.  Sometimes there are thoughtful critical and reflective reviews.  I'm going to gush!I didn't start out to buy a 720p Panasonic 42 inch plasma.  My original target was a 1080p LCD in the 37 to 42 inch range.  The price range was $750-$1000.  I did my internet home work and created my short list of 7 TV's.  Then I started visiting showrooms.If you can afford a 1080p set, get it.  But I'm convinced that the difference with a 720p set is only visible with larger screens, and when sitting very close to the screen.It is hard to find a knowledgeable, helpful sales clerk.  I got lucky at Sears.  This clerk convinced me to add the Panasonic plasma to my short list.  One of the attractions of the plasma was its ability to represent motion with a minimum of blurring or smearing.  Also there have been significant improvements in plasma technology.  But I still wasn't sold on the idea of a plasma set.Then I went to another store which had an amazing display comparing sets with a 60hz refresh rate and a 120hz refresh rate.  The sets were arranged vertically and displayed the same sweeping panoramic images.  The difference in clarity was astonishing.  Yet I could not justify paying the premium (several hundred dollars) for the 120hz refresh rate.My understanding is that the plasma's 450hz refresh rate produces a motion image equivalent in quality (some say better) to that of a 120hz LCD.  After doing some more internet research, I concluded that buying this set was a no brainer.I bought mine at Sears the next day, picked it up, took it home, and had neighbor help me lift it and set it on my TV stand. I could have saved money buying it online, but I had to have it NOW!  (The price on Amazon fluctuates, but I could have saved $100 to $150.)Attaching my SONY upconverting DVD player ($80) was very simple, as was connecting my old SD satellite box.  The whole process took about an hour, and I was quickly watching my first DVD, the avian documentary Winged Migration with its jaw dropping cinematography.  Watching my cats react to the bird images was amazing in itself.I had some frustrations with screen images after my new Dish Network HD satellite box was installed.  There are several \"format\" settings on both the TV and the satellite box:  zoom, full, just, 4:3, etc.  At first the images for SD TV channels were larger than the screen and of poor quality.  It took me a couple of hours to begin understanding the concept of formats, to discover the \"format\" button on the satellite remote,  and to figure out the right combination of TV and satellite box settings to get images to display correctly.The HD channel images are extra-ordinary.  The SD channel images are better than I could ever have imagined.  These, in combination with the novelty of an image twice as big as my old TV is still producing a \"wow\" effect for me.As I said at the beginning, you will probably be ecstatic with whatever set you buy.

In the past with old plasma TVs, burn-in or image retention was a problem, but on this TV, I have had VERY LITTLE image retention on this TV (if there ever is any, it is only visible on a blank input screen.  Never while there is a game, movie, or tv show on).  Many people shy away from plasmas for gaming but that is not a problem on this TV set.  If you are really paranoid about it, cycle TV watching with your gaming for the first month or two.  On a less stellar note, I was disappointed with the picture quality of the PS2 while playing it on this plasma.  Even with quality component cables, the picture quality was a little fuzzy at times, depending on the game.  However, this problem is not unique to this plasma but occurs on other HDTVs as well.  Just something to take note of.Other notes:  The vibrant colors and the deep, beautiful black colors on this TV are amazing.  The TV is quiet, even while muted (no buzzing or humming sounds).  I'm quite satisfied with the picture quality on standard definition TV (SDTV).  Even with no cable box, the picture quality on channels is better than most other HDTVs I've seen in standard definition.

WOW! WOW! That's the first words that came to mind when I put a Blu-Ray dvd in my Playstation 3 and turned on this awesome plasma tv. I've never seen a better picture and I've been to all those Best Buy/Circuit City stores and seen all there high end tv's in high def and this one stands up against all of them and holds it own and beats many of them all around.The picture is bright, punchy and very clear. The blacks and reds are deep and rich. To put it in a nutshell, the picture looks surreal! True this is a 720p plasma, but it looks better than some of those 50 inch, 1080p Pioneer plasmas. My friend has a high end Pioneer plasma 50 incher(I forget what the model number is but its the best 50 inch one you can get from Pioneer.....I think its something like Euro or Uro or maybe Kuro in the model number)and I kid you not, this Panasonic Viera TH-42PX80U looks better than his and this one is about a $2000 cheaper.Don't believe all that hype about 1080p either! With televisions, whether it be plasma or lcd, anything under 5o inches you will only be able to tell a tiny bit of difference in picture quality, if any at all with 1080p versus 720p. True, you can see a difference with the 58 to 65 inchers, but not really as much as you'd think.As a comparison to this plasma, I bought a Panasonic 42d64u slim line lcd model back in November(sold it to my Dad so I could get this) and this plasma clearly has it beat in picture, sound, price, features, remote.......you name it.To sum it up, this Panasonic Viera TH-42PX80U is all you could ask for in a tv and more. The sound is so good you don't need a surround sound system. Thundering bass!!! The picture is absolutely amazing in high definition(This plasma has 1,000,000:1 dynamic contrast(that's right 1 million with 6 zeroes! Has to be a first!)and 15,000:1 native contrast, which is a technical way of saying this tv is AWESOME!) and still looks really good in standard definition(much better than lcd). Video games whether it be on the 360 or PS3 look stunning!!! 3 HDMI inputs with 1 in the front for easy access! I love the remote control! It's not big and gawky like many remotes and has easy to use buttons. I just wish it had a backlight button to light up the remote. Actually it may and I just haven't discovered it yet. This is a very attractive television and it's nice and slim(this is new to this model) so it doesn't take up a bunch of room.Don't worry about screen burn in with these new plasmas. Hard to get burn in on them due to safety features such as screen saver and sleeptimer in case you fall asleep while you're watching a movie. Hands down this is the best tv you can get for the price! Do yourself a favor and go get one of these affordable plasmas at a great price and be blown away by the picture and sound.As a side note: Amazon's free shipping, white glove delivery service was perfect and hassle free. The delivery peeps carried it in where I wanted it, unboxed it, and hooked up everything including my 360, PS3, Nintendo Wii and surround sound system(which isn't needed with this tv's great sound).

Last year I did months of research to find the right tv, and decided plasma was right for me.  I liked the darker blacks, and plasma handles sports better than HDTVs at the same price level.  The 720p resolution was great from more than 10 feet, so the price was right.  I really liked the Pioneers too, but the premium pricing was too much for me.  Samsungs were similarly priced, but I didn't like the frames and that distracting blue light on the front.So when I wanted to get a tv for my bedroom, I came back to Panasonic. I looked at several models (1080p versions, bigger versions) and ultimately decided for the price and since it was for my bedroom, that I would be happy with this version. I couldn't justify spending 200 or more extra to get a 1080p version when cable is broadcast in 720p or 1080i.I am very happy with the choice.  Yes, if you stand within 4 feet of the set, you will see a screen door effect from the 720p resolution, but back off further than that (I am about 10 feet away in bed) and the picture is crisp and clear. At 42 in (and even 50 at normal seating distance), it is very hard to discern any resolution difference). The blacks are rich and the colors are vibrant.  I also like that Panasonic was more thoughtful about where they placed the connections on the back this year, which make it a bit easier to get to them.  And I find that the speakers are better quality than last year (and again, for the bedroom, just fine).  I have my larger set hooked up to a receiver and speakers to manage sound in the living room.The drawbacks:  this tv doesn't resolve some of the deep color gradients like a more expensive set would.  For example, when there is a sun on the tv, you can see the rings of color subtly rather than the tv solving those into more of a smoothing effect.  Not a big deal, but it is noticable.  Also, I am not a fan of the stand this year as opposed to the previous year.  It just seems a little cheaper, but still does it's job.So, bottom line, a great tv in its class.  If you want top of the line, you will have to spend significantly more.  But this set is still very good.", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV for a 720p Plasma", "Author": "Larry Luv", "ReviewID": "R2VEPOFIZF59RZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camped out for this tv on Black Friday at a local store in Detroit, and I gotta say I'm glad I waited this long to get a tv!First off, I've been scouting HDTVs for the past 2 years, on the verge of insanity as good deals had come and gone. I REFUSED to get a plasma screen, as I loved the LCD tv in our living room. I needed a tv for the man's room in the basement, and I knew Black Friday '08 was my time.It was advertised locally at $544, only as a Panasonic 42'' HDTV. No further info was given, so I wasn't sure what to make of it. A Sharp 37'' was on sale for $397 that same day, so I was gonna pounce on one of the two. When I learned it was Plasma and 720p, I started having second thoughts. But I didn't freeze my arse off for four hours to get anything less than 42'' if it was available, so I pulled the proverbial trigger.Wow, thank god I did.Playing with the settings on the GAME preset has given me the best picture possible, IMO. HD channels on this tv come out superb, as I'm hooked up through HDMI. I have an Xbox 360, and I want to cry at how beautiful the screen is when playing Gears of War 2 or Saint's Row 2. Gaming on this machine is simply great.I THINK I can tell it's a 720p reso from my naked eye, but I don't really care. For what I got at the price, this tv is fantastic.As a plasma, the worries of reflections I had were diminished to a degree. I had to do some lighting adjustments in order to prevent that glare from taking over the screen. The black levels are awesome, but I find myself having to brighten up the screen at times, depending on the source. The colors jump out beautifully, especially watching sports and food network in HD.Yes, there are 1080p LCDs out there falling in prices, but those are usually brands that make you second guess. I was more than willing to take the chance, but I admit that I love the security of a better brand name in Panasonic. If you can get a good deal on this tv, make it so.UPDATE: January 6, 2009Ok, so after a bit longer with this puppy as the centerpiece of my man-cave, I've found the best settings for Xbox/DVD/any HD Source:Picture Mode: VividPicture: 100Brightness: 77Color: 60Tint: 0Sharpness: 81Color Temp: CoolColor Mgmt: ONVideo Noise Reduction: ONMPEG Noise Reduction: OnBlack Level: DarkI think the black level will be adjusted a lot, pending on what you watch. Some sources get a bit too dark at times. I've yet to find a good setting for SD sources, but the few I've toyed with aren't bad. I think SD is the one source you have to play around with till you get what you like.I read somewhere that this was on the Energy Star brownie list for having awesome power usage for a plasma screen. You'll have to look that one up if you want to confirm that.One splendid surprise were how some of my regular DVDs really perform on this tv through my Xbox HD DVD player. Someone told me that this player does not upconvert without VGA inputs, and I'm using component. All six Star Wars films look great from their DVD source. However, if you have a copy of 'The Fifth Element' or 'Starship Troopers', you will be amazed at how much detail jumps out at you. I can't wait to see 'The Fifth Element' in HD.I also found the best way to test the picture of this tv is to watch some current animated features on standard DVD. Flat-out amazing some of the pictures I saw. 'The Incredibles' plays beautifully, as does 'Princess Mononoke'.A newer review pointed out the issues using HDMI and how it won't output the sound to receivers using the stereo cables, or whatever they are. The digital audio out is supposedly a \"down graded\" filtered audio quality, but it will should get you stereo sound for those of us who have receivers from the past decade that don't have HDMI. So be sure to take note of that. I drove myself nuts trying to get sound on my receiver from MDMI when I first hooked it up.I received a lot of compliments on this tv during the Holidays from family and friends. We watched 'Transformers' on HD DVD and everyone was blown away at the quality.

Price - best priced 42\" 720p that I found. (I paid 599.99 at Boscov's)2. Plasma - this is the great debate - plasma vs. LCD.  For my money, with all network transmissions being 720p and me liking sports so much - plasma was the way to go.  In the middle of the day glare was not an issue at all.3. Heat - this set only gets mildly warm.  All other plasmas that I checked out either got very warm or straight up hot.  Heat kills electronics.  I bet this has a lot to do with Panasonic having the best repair record in the plasma game.4. Picture - it looks good!  I have read C-NET complain of noise - I watch at about 8-10 feet and it just looks great.I had some concerns that so far have proved to be unfounded.1. I thought the styling was ho-hum and that I would not like that it did not have a swivel stand.  The TV looks much better in our home than it does in the pics on the net.  The high gloss black stand 'disappears' and all I see is the great picture.2. Becasue of the price the picture had to suffer in some way.  Not that I can tell!  I even have the brightness set to 30/100 becasue I read somewhere that you should do that for the first 100 hours.  Honestly, I am not sure I will up it since it looks fine as is.3. Becasue its a plasma there is that IR or screen burn issue.  This one I can't speak to.  Only had the TV 4 days now - time will tell.Another aspect I can not speak to is sound.  It seemed fine during testing, but I have a surround sound setup so I don't use the speakers on the TV.  I find this TV does a better job at standard def than I thought it would.  It certainly looks better than the LCD's I have seen.You will not be sorry your bought this TV.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Solid TV", "Author": "Red Dog \"JDR\"", "ReviewID": "R3OQQ5DSZKH1TH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was given this TV as a gift - man, what a gift.

It's great, don't get me wrong. But i'm not sure it's really improved my overall television viewing experience. But i digress - it's a great tv, picture is mighty fine, but i did have a really bad experience with the delivery. The folks that J&R; hired to deliver the tv - Urban Express - did a crap job. I was supposed to get the white glove service - where they delivery the tv and also hook up to your cable and install the tv, etc - but instead, got something quite different. The 2 guys come in, they take the tv out of the cardboard box, attach the base, and place the tv on my tv stand. As they start to leave, i ask them if they can help me hook up/connect the TV and make sure the HD portion works to maximum effectiveness (because this was the service we paid extra for - delivery and white glove service). Well, long story short, they said sorry, can't help you, that will be an extra $168 or something. I quizically say ok, well thanks but no thanks, and they take off. So - idiot that i am - i spend 25 minutes trying to set up the damn tv, with no luck, and then lo and behold the guys come back to apologize and say they were really responsible for setting up and connecting the tv. They come back inside, futz around for 10 minutes, and proclaim \"sorry - we don't know how to set this up.\" They say they have to get a \"specialist\" to help. 1 hour later, they're back with the new guy, who takes 30 seconds to get everything up and running.

This unit looks huge in our 12x24 viewing room. Ignore the sites that tell you you have to have at least 50\" if you view from 15' away - it is not true.  Sports on this size HD screen is a fantastic new experience.I have this hooked up via HDMI cables to a new upconvert DVD (Phillips, $80, also from amazon)and the HD cable box. Sound is excellent though I'm sure surround sound is a lot better. However I am satisfied with the tv speakers.I got this from Amazon for a little over $800 (how much cheaper can they get??), which is a steal compared to what I planned on buying. Even the pros say 1080p doesn't gain you any viewing pleasure over 720p at sizes under 50\", and I cannot say for sure whether I really need the enhanced contrast (whatever that really means) of the more expensive Panasonic models.White-glove delivery was excellent - it arrived in about 4 days (the estimate was much longer) the guy set it up, showed me it was working, and took all of the packaging away, all in under 10 minutes.  I advise keeping an eye on your package tracking, and as soon as indicates that it's near your town get in touch with the shipper directly to ensure that you are contacted promptly.Hooking up the TV was really easy - just plugged in 2 HDMI cables and away we went. A far preferable approach to the old way. One thing I do not understand is now that you can buy an adequate HDMI cable for under $2 at amazon, why don't the TV companies provide them?  Order a few with your tv.  They do give you some audio and video cables in the box, which you can throw away.If you are interested in an economical HD setup, this is really the way to go.

We put this one in our bedroom.  It's borderline too large for our bedroom.  It's close to looking like we have a bed in our TV room.  This may be a bit of my envy showing.  This TV is far better than my living room TV and even though I'd like a slightly larger set for the living room, this set is so much better than what I currently have.  The colors are just so much more vivid.  I moved my Xbox back to play Bioshock.  The picture was stunning.The only complaint I have is the sound.  It has been tough to manage it, especially after my wife falls asleep.  I feel like Goldilocks.  The sound is either too loud or too quiet, but never just right.Digital shows look good, HD shows shine.  Just remember if you are watching shows not shown in HD, you lost a lot of the TV screen.  Non-HD shows have bars on each side that are approximately 4/5 inches wide.  Some shows add additional bars on top and bottom.  What once was a 42-inch screen is now a lot smaller.  This is what sold me to upgrade to HD programing.And to help you avoid the dumb, blank look I gave our Comcast representative, HD programing is not digital and it is an upgrade.  Digital means nothing to me.  It looks like the vast majority of programs are now digital, most are not shown in HD.  HD is when the entire screen on the new wide TVs is filled.  All of the major channels' prime time shows are shown in HD.  There are now two channels for most network and many cable channels, one in digital and one in HD.  Sometimes the shows are different, much to the delight of my wife.  The food network has two channels showing different programing, especially if the one on the main channel is not available in HD.But all of this new wide-screen real estate comes at a cost.  Comcast (this is my TV provider) charges additional dollars to access HD programing, about $20 more per month.  I can't tell you how it added up to $20.  I remember HD added about $7, the two boxes added more (Yes, each TV requires a box.  By then my head was spinning and I wanted out.The picture is great.

Why look at five inch stripes on both sides of the set without any hope to use the entire screen?

Ok, I admit that I can't count, LOL! Seriously, it's even worth paying a little more to get Amazon's WGD service as they will deliver the TV to the room of your choice (even upstairs), unpack, assemble, put it on your table/stand, make sure it works and then remove all packing mat'ls/debris from the home. It is well worth it! Most vendors will deliver either to the curb or to your door and make you sign then they leave. Unless you outright refuse delivery, it's your problem to return if it arrives broken! Amazon uses CEVA Logistics and they will make sure it's right or they will take it back on the spot! Amazon also has a \"large purchase\" dept. within their Customer Service Department that specializes in delivery of big-dollar items like flat-panel TV's.

Ultimately, after reading through hundreds of posts at AVSForum, decided that the Samsung only offered a swivel stand as the price premium over the Panasonic.  Most users seemed to prefer the Panasonic for color reproduction, as well as reliability.  Of course, don't take my word for it- I encourage you to view both TVs in-store at your local Best Buy or Fry's or HHGregg.  I had a chance to view both TVs side by side at Best Buy, and I felt the colors were both brighter and more accurate on the Panasonic.Out of the box, even with the settings turned down for the first 100 hours of break-in, the picture is incredible.  The colors are bright, accurate, and the blacks are blacker than even the best LCDs, IMO.  And this is all on a budget plasma.  I haven't noticed any burn-in so far, so hopefully there won't be any issues on that front.Power consumption-wise, the peak power usage is above 300 watts, but that's only if you're running at full brightness, in vivid mode, with a white screen flashing all day.

This TV can take in audio and spit it out, allowing you to plug in your devices with HDMI or Coax without worrying about how the sound will get to your sound system.For those of you who aren't picky about the life of your TV, you can change the color of the 4:3 bars on either side of the TV from gray to black.The ability to plug in a standard SD card from your camera is much more useful than you think:You know when you are out for the day, come home, and want to show your sweetheart the weird lizard you saw, but don't want to get out the Camera cable?  Put the camera card right into the TV for a clear picture!The pros: 3 HDMI ports, plenty of connection options, 720p is more than enough for this size TV, Burn-in reduction tools, reasonable price for a big-screen HD, fairly light for the size.The cons: It's Plasma: Burn in IS an issue.  Awkward menu screens, non-sense presets, cuts off sound output when using Scrolling Bar (burn in prevention).This is one of the best TVs on the market for what it is -- Panasonics are reliable, and this television is on-par with any 720p screen on the market.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Soild Plasma TV", "Author": "Billy", "ReviewID": "RCMPMOVCA67IC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is a great value for it's price, and since i've had it i haven't had any problems.My frined has a 50\" 1080p and other than the noticeable size differece you can't tell mines 720p and his is 1080p.

Cowan", "ReviewID": "R2L7ESVXPF588V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was shopping for a cheap hdtv and saw this on sale. After checking reviews and seeing it consistently get good scores I ordered it.  After my order had been placed and was in shipping status, I noticed that this set had a resolution of only 1024x768, which is below the 'true' 720p spec that most sets use.  I was concerned that the quality of the image would suffer, as I tend to be a stickler for image quality (one reason I went plasma over LCD), but decided to reserve judgement until I had the set in my home.Delivery was prompt and friendly - the deliveryman assembled the set and placed it on my stand. I configured settings as per recommendations on avsforums, and loaded up some high-def content.  It was truly astonishing, compared to my old standard definition set.  My viewing distance is about 10', and after comparing higher resolution sets in stores to my model, at my viewing distance there is truly no difference.  Blacks are much, much better than any comparably priced lcd. No pixel 'squirm' like you tend to get on lcds. There is some color banding, 'deep color' or no, but it is very, very rare and minimal.The only negatives I have about the set is that the 'Just' setting (which scales 4:3 content to fit the 16:9 screen) stretches the middle area too much; it's hardly better than the 'HFill' setting.  I'd much prefer more distortion on the edge and a more accurate aspect ratio in the middle of the screen. The result is that I tend to watch any 4:3 content pillarboxed (pillars on the side) with grey bars, out of perhaps an abundance of caution.  This used to be more necessary with older plasmas due to burn-in issues -- they would recommend not to use black bars for pillarboxing -- but this set is rated for 100,000 hours until 50% brightness, which is 30 years @ 8 hours / day.  I would guess that pillarboxing with black bars (which is visually preferable) would be just fine.For the price, I doubt you can find a better quality set.", "Date": "January 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "TV...so far so good.

FYI I have a Sony XBR5 46\" in my basement so the comparison is based on that TV. The Pannie is pretty good. The colors are not as accurate as the Sony and the HD doesn't come in as sharp. Otherwise, it looks great for what I paid for it. It's a lot better than my friend's Toshiba Regza. He paid almost a $1000 for a 42\" as well and from watching the Cards/Eagles game this last weekend, the Cards jersey was dark hot pink rather than red.Overall I'm satisfied. My only complaint was the delivery. First they came on the wrong day. Then the wrong time. Then they got snow on their boots and tracked snow and mud on my new wood floors with it. I guess they don't like removing their shoes. Once they hooked it up, they didn't bother to connect the coaxel to the HD box. We waited for minutes for the box to search and search and then they realize they didn't screw in the coaxel (Duhhh). Finally they screwed it in but still couldn't pick up the channels (I have Direct TV). They said to call D*. I said I can finish it up and sent them packing. I found out they connected the coaxel backwards. What a bunch of yahoos. Anyways, I had to clean up all the mess they made on my floors. Puddles of mud everywhere including behind the TV stand.

There are some with slightly better pictures but the price that I paid for the unit ($650), you can't beat it.  I've watched a fair amount of NASCAR, hockey and football on this television and the ability to follow the action, especially a black puck moving quickly across white ice, is absolutely outstanding.  I've also watched a few movies streamed from Netflix through X-box 360 and based on the fact that I'm viewing them over a wireless connection to the X-box, the video is quite good.  Video games, especially ones such as Halo and Call of Duty display quite well.Overall, I realize that true video aficionados will see this unit as somewhat sub par compared to higher priced Sonys and LGs and Samsungs, but for people who watch television on a somewhat casual basis, play some video games and want a good value, this is an outstanding purchase.Additionally, the audio, which is something most people overlook, is really quite impressive coming from the small speakers in the TV.  I do have it connected to a 5 channel surround system which is how I listen to most movies, but watching most other shows, the speakers are really quite good.  I do plan on adding a HD Tivo soon (I currently have a non HD Tivo connected to the unit) and expect that the resulting picture will be quite good.I would recommend this set to anyone and would buy another in a heartbeat.

This is, of course, until Amazon and other retailers had this baby available earlier this year at a fantastic...unbeatable, really, price.Now, I warmed to the idea, but again, I need to know what exactly I'm doing with my hard earned cash.  I spent countless hours not only deciding the LCD -vs- Plasma -vs- DLP debate (I settled on plasma), but which brand/size/etc  I definitely wanted to stick with until the next \"latest and greatest\" technology craze bites.I concluded the Panasonic 42\" TH-42PX80U was the way to go.  Not only do multiple professional reviews give Panasonic props for displaying the truest blacks, but they also produce a plasma which should have the capacity to run approximately 8 hours a day for the next 20 years.  For the price compared ot LCD, at the time, it was a no-brainer for me.So, while I'm not much for opening new credit cards, I did accept Amazons offer to create a credit line for no interest over a period of six months.  To sweeten the deal, I also received Amazon's 'White Glove Delivery' service.  A1 absolutely fantastic.Four months with the new TV, and I'm smitten.  It looks great and connected nicely with my Denon AV surround receiver.  Blue Ray's look great, as do the new episodes of Lost, and as I'm sure it will when the Cubs win the series this year ;-).

But as a general rule of thumb, you can only tell the difference between a 720p and a 1080p set when you are dealing with TVs that are 50\" or more in size. Think of it as a 3 megapixel photograph. At 4\" x 5\" it's going to look perfectly sharp. And it's certainly not going to get any sharper if you shrink it down to 4\" x 3\". It only makes a difference if you are enlarging the picture; then things start to get blurry. It's the same thing with 1080p on a 42\" set: you're getting extra resolution that you just can't see.Still, 720p is not considered good enough any more, so if you shop around you can get this set for a a very good price. You shouldn't have any trouble getting it for between $800 and $900. And it's a great set: beautiful color, handles blacks nicely, has a nice matte finish on the screen, and it's viewable from different angles, so if you're sitting off to the side it looks just fine.

I adjusted the picture (brightness, contrast...) to my personal taste and the result is exceptional from COMCAST HD cable TV using an HDMI cable from the TV to the cable box.  I spent around $8 on the cable as my research indicated that there is no extra value in buying an expensice HDMI cable - just get the least expensive one that is truly HDMI compatible. Speaking of research, I agree with most on-line research that 720p is fine and you do not need to spend the extra for 1080p unless you do a lot of gaming or watch DVDs.  I use the set mostly for watching cable TV and even though I have HD cable coxes, I have not seen anything that indicates stations will be broadcasting anything in 1080 anytime soon.  Since they recently spent the money to upgrade to 720, and not all have done so yet, I don't think they will be anxious to spend more for another upgrade for a while.The \"white glove\" delivery service did call to arrange delivery, but not within the 5 advertised timeframe.

I tried out several games on my Sony 46\" set and then compared them on the 42\" 720p set. When the games are in motion you really can not tell too much, however there is just a slight amount of clarity and sharpness you can get with the extra resolution. I can pause a game and notice a mesh texture on a game, such as a soldiers uniform having slightly more detail at 1080p rather than 720p. I've been playing games ever since they were just green blocks on a screen and I believe there's a difference.However does that difference really matter? Not really. I was playing the Killzone 2 demo [downloaded from the UK Playstation store] and it looked fantastic at either resolution at either TV.The TV performs beautifully, and looks very nice, though it's a bit of a dust magnet for the Arizona climate here.

The external measurements allowed me to have a 42\" screen with a 40.2\" case width that would fit in the entertainment center we already owned.I was impressed with the White Glove delivery that was provided free with the order. The set arrived earlier than expected and the carrier was efficient about contacting me and setting up a delivery time. They even came on Saturday morning! They unboxed the unit and assembled the stand in minutes. The set was placed in the cabinet and it was not turned on because it was cold. The set up was very easy so it would have been easy without their help. I had the chance to see there was no physical damage to the set! The delivery men assured me that Amazon customer service was excellent but fortunately I have not had to use it in the first month of use. Another family member has 2+ year old Panasonic 42\" plasma and has had no issues with it either. It would be nice to have more options (SD only) for card readers or an option for a flash drive to look at digital pictures.

We absolutely love the TV.  I just assisted my mother in buying this TV from Sears.  While I have only had our most recent purchase for about a month now, the one we bought almost exactly one year ago to the day is still performing perfectly.  Our new one is mounted on the wall and it looks awesome!  The white-glove shipping leave a little to be desired by Amazon but it was delivered in perfect condition and that is what counts.

My mom is absolutely thrilled with the TV and she doesn't even have an HD box, YET.  It does look good in non-HD but the TV is made for High-Definition viewing for sure.  Sports are absolutely the best.  For a current retail price of $699-$799, I sincerely believe this TV to be the Best Value 42\" Flat Panel on the market, Plasma or LCD.  Which brings me to another matter.....why are people so in love with LCD?  In my opinion, especially for the price, plasma blows away LCD.

After much research I decided to go with the 40in Toshiba LCD (mainly bc my wife kept pushing the 1080 vs 720 issue).  After 2 weeks with the Toshiba, I was just not happy with the colors on the LCD.  I took my wife to Best Buy and had her look at the Panasonic side to side with the Toshiba and she finally came around to see how the Panasonic picture was better and she couldn't tell the difference between 1080 vs 720.  Returned the Toshiba and ordered the Panasonic from Amazon.This TV is great!  Verizon FIOS looks 5 times better than on the 1080 LCD.  Also, the fact that the picture looks darker with the plasma, it makes it easier on the eyes.  We felt a lot of strain on our eyes with the LCD because of how bright it was.SD signals are good but definitely no match to HD channels.  Highly recommend using HDMI cables from video source and optical audio cable to surround sound system for best results.  Don't buy these cables from local retailers.  Several online stores have them for $2-$5 each and they work as great as the Monster cables they sell for $50.Nintendo Wii looks awesome, and my upconverting DVD player is also great.  Couldn't be happier with the TV.Delivery was great as well.  TV arrived 5 days before Amazon's timeline and the delivery guys set up the stand and the HDMI connection for my wife.

The TV was easy to setup and I had it up and running just a few minutes after bringing it home.  To me, it is relatively light at just over 60 lbs. (especially compared to the 160 lb+ 35\" CRT I had to move so this TV could replace it) and the two handles at the lower back make it very easy for me to move by myself.I bought the TV just to watch some local HD and SD cable.  The SD material from the cable source is very watchable, with most of channels looking very clear.  The picture quality on SD really out performed my expectations (based on looking at most HD TVs on show room floors).The over the HD content is excellent. I have been very impressed with both 720p signals (such as FOX) and 1080i material from the other stations.  In all cases, the picture quality does not appear to take much of a hit for only being 1024x768 (versus 1366x768 on LCDs and larger plasmas).My DVD player is now hooked up as a 480p source and again, the picture has been very good.An HD source definitely looks better and sharper then the SD and DVD sources, but I am very happy overall.The built-in speakers have been good for just watching TV and I have not had any issues with them in that capacity.  For DVDs and sporting events, I tend to pump the sound through my home theater system instead.  I did find my Wii tended to push the speakers a little hard, but I usually run that through the home theater anyway, so no big deal.I have four minor complaints:1.  Even after making several adjustments, the tint/color settings on the TV are hard to perfect.  Part of this is due to different quality signals from the various stations, but part is the green tint/red color control.  I cannot seem to get a good red balance without a very slight green tint (very minor -- maybe just me being to picky?!?).2.  While the black levels are good, I do not believe they are great.  In my opinion, the black levels on the 35\" Sony CRT this replaced were better.  Again, minor overall.3.  Would have liked a remote with backlit keys so i could see them in the dark instead on having to memorize the key positions.4.  Being a plasma, the TV will end up with more energy then an equivalent LCD.In conclusion, I have not found a better TV for the price and would purchase this TV again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV at a great price", "Author": "D.

I couldn't be happier with my panny.UPDATE:  I now own the 42\" and 52\" px80U models.  I never have had any image retention in either set and I'm perfectly satisfied with the picture quality from both sets.  I have a 1080P HD-DVD player and the picture quality is excellent while playing in 1080P24 mode.  The TV does a good job of converting the 1080P24 signal to 720P. I would still today buy the 720P sets over the 1080P sets in my viewing conditions.  I'm 13' away for the 50\" set and 11' away for the 42\" set.  Paying $600 to $1000 more for 1080P is a waste for my conditions.  I've had the sets for around 6 months now.", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV, fast delivery", "Author": "L. Hayes", "ReviewID": "R1T37LCWDEASOK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is terrific. The colors are bright and clear. I am very happy with it. I paid extra for the OnCallInstalls but only because there was a rebate to pay for the full amount of the installation. I think I could have hooked up the tv myself...it isn't that complicated. However, for free two men came out and hooked it up and gave me a lesson. Most importantly, the total price will be refunded. Without that, it would not be worth it. However, they did move my existing tv down to the family room. I tipped them $10 though I don't know if you are supposed to do that. All in all, the TV is worth the money. I would only pay for the installation if there is a refund or if I was totally unable to lift the tv to the stand and connect it.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Panasonic 42\" plasma", "Author": "J.

I was afraid I would not want to watch TV on my larger DLP after buying it.  Unfortunately, the noise reduction on this unit is really bad (most likely non-existent) and the picture has snow especially with dark scenes and HD content.  The review of the TV on CNET.com also points out the bad noise reduction and warns buyers to look elsewhere if they want a crystal clear picture.  I wish that they had posted it before I bought the TV .  As every other reviewer has mentioned in their reviews, the black levels are excellent. However, in my opinion, the lack of proper noise reduction makes the picture look like a mix between HD and SD at a considerable 9ft distance.  Anything less than 9ft should not be considered.  When I sit 12-15 ft away, I get a clear picture that's comparable to my DLP but it almost feels like I'm sitting in a different room.[...].", "Date": "May 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "A to Z Guarantee is Worthless", "Author": "Anthony Edl", "ReviewID": "RPHRNVYUATBS1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have ordered many items on Amazon.com and have always had an excellent customer experience until I ordered a 42\" Plasma TV that was offered by Adorama Camera, an Amazon.com vendor.

Adorama said they had no more TVs in stock and would return my purchase price through Amazon. I submitted an A to Z Guarantee claim to Amazon. Amazon said it was my fault because the seller included a disclosure that said I had to submit a claim to the manufacturer for warranty replacement or repair.

I tried calling them several times and they are not picking up the phone, and I called panasonic customer care center to get the status.  Even they couldn't help me for last two weeks.
