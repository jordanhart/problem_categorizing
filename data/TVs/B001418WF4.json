{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A perfect purchase", "Author": "E. T. Hildebrand", "ReviewID": "R2GD4665G95YCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[...]Amazon tracking indicated it would take 2 weeks to arrive. CEVA tracking listed it at two days earlier. I received the call for delivery in less than a week - and this included the holiday period!CEVA showed up with it yesterday. The heavy cardboard box had an 18\" gash/tear in it and my heart sank. They removed the box and I noticed the screen was supported about 8\" from the cardboard and there were no signs that whatever caused the gash had touched anything. We quickly plugged it into the wall and ran it thru some of the built-in menus. Relief - everything worked fine. With the 30-day return guarantee there was nothing more to worry about.The previous day Amazon had delivered a new Onkyo receiver to replace my older Yamaha. I had already disconnected the Yamaha and wired all the components and speakers to this new receiver (to take advantage of its HDMI capabilities). It now only took a couple hours to make the final connections with the receiver, cable sysem, over-the-air antenna, HTPC and network.Every single system worked perfectly, even though it sometimes took a few minutes to discover the correct input settings on each device to get everything communicating. The biggest surprise was the quality of the picture. After reading everything I could find on various forums I expected to have some tweaking to do before obtaining the best images. While critically inspecting the imagery for each type of input I could not see a need to adjust anything! Just for experimentation I did make a few selections of alternate settings, but always wound up returning to the original. I'll likely use an Avia program to verify adjustments  later, but can't imagine any improvement.The \"halo effect\" feature on the upper and lower bezel was obvious (albeit faint) to see, but it was not distracting. In fact, if there were a switch available to turn it on and off, I'd still leave it on - it's neat! The red bezel highlighting (the TOC) is so subtle that it is nearly invisible. If I didn't know it was there I'd likely not have even noticed it. Perhaps it would be more visible in a room with bright daylighting?Another neat feature is the touch sensitive controls on the lower right bezel. They are invisible until you touch the area, causing them to temporarily sequentially illuminate. I haven't fully explored this feature yet.Another nice feature was discovering that I could hook up the computer to HDMI connection #2 and play computer games without any special adjustments. There was no lag or any problem except that I'll need to upgrade the computer's video card in order to take the display all the way up to its full resolution. Nevertheless, the Samsung must have been upscaling the image since it was extremely sharp. (Same thing with the 480i DVDs we played on it - very sharp). When not in use we intend to leave the computer hooked up so the Samsung will continuously display it's screensaver which cross-fades family photos like a huge digital picture frame.The Samsung has a TOSLINK out connection which I connected to the receiver. This vastly simplifies audio connections since all audio sent to the TV can be amplified from a single connection to the receiver. If you can connect everything via HDMI there will be significantly fewer wires and a much more simplified operation.The only thing I would have preferred is if the base would swivel. I understand the 650 models swivel, can't imagine why Samsung wouldn't include that feature here.We're very happy with this purchase.EDIT- 6-18-08After nearly 3 weeks of use we are even more impressed with this TV.I have upgraded the video card on the attached computer so that it can now attain full 1080p resolution, only to find the text too small to be readable at a normal viewing distance of about 12 feet with my 60-yr-old eyes. Backing off the resolution makes the text large enough to read while retaining its razor-sharpness.The attached computer is connected with a wireless hub to my home network, allowing it to stream pictures, music, or movies from any of the computers. The TV must be upconverting the movies to 1080p because they are displayed more clearly than when sent to a regular computer monitor.The hub also provides a patch cable to the TVs' network port, which allows it to run all the InfoLink connection functions (weather, news, stocks) without the need to even configure that connection.We added a PS3 a week ago to view blu-ray movies. What an incredible picture! Even though we are using inexpensive $3 HDMI cables, there was no flickering or other problem as reported on another Amazon review. My son tested out his new Metal Gear PS3 game and was impressed with the image and game play. We used the default settings and did not even switch to \"game\" mode.We've now had time to run THX and TVBlink video calibration tests and were not surprised to find that all the default settings were already set to the optimum values for our personal tastes.The set is now mounted on one of those entertainment center \"stalks\" which allows it to be easily rotated (for easier access to the rear connections). This mounting has taken care of the only complaint we had about this set - its' lack of a swivel base.Edit - 7-16-08After 6 weeks of use I must say that this has proven to be one awesome piece of electronics. I simply cannot believe how great this set has performed. The color and details have greatly exceeded my highest expectations. We have begun replaying our old DVD library because the upscaling capabilities built into this set appears to make them very comparable to the Blu-Ray movies we've viewed. It's like seeing a new movie!It is quite a kick to be using the computer while watching the nightly news in HD via the PIP function.A lot of people have calibrated their sets using the published settings on AVSforum.com. We tested all of those settings and found that they each resulted in a darker picture that has lost details in shadowy areas and the colors are dull, without the \"pop\" of the factory settings. Keep in mind that our entertainment area is in a dark, windowless room which should make viewing dimmer features easier. We tried compensating the calibration with various picture adjustments but were unable to attain comparable performance. After a week of trying to perceive any improvements we reverted our settings back to the original, tweaked, factory settings.Several people have made similar observations, leading us to a conclusion that either there is a wide discrepancy between personal preferences and/or each of these sets have varying image displays. We have no doubt that many people do see improved performance after calibrating their sets - but before you spend a lot of money on professional calibration try the AVSforum settings first to verify if you see any improvement.The only complaint we have is that we've now been spoiled by what this set can do. We picked up a new Samsung T260HD computer monitor (which also includes an HDTV tuner). This is a 26\" monitor that has a similar TOC bezel to match the LN52A750. You can read our review here on Amazon - in a nutshell, we are disappointed with it's performance.", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Better processing than the a650 line - perfect for gaming", "Author": "Gadgety", "ReviewID": "R1BMDQ0EJEAPJV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been agonizing over an HDTV purchase for months. My 32\" 480p Samsung CRT just wasn't doing it for me anymore. It was time to delve into HD now that it has been around for awhile with major tech innovations (1080p, 120hz, and more). I feel as though it will be many years before a *significant* new HD technology comes along. Here is a list of what I've been agonizing over (and probably you too) and why I made the decision for the 750.1. LNxxa750 vs LNxxa650I spent some time drooling over the LN52a650 until I came across LN52a750. I searched and searched to see if there was a performance difference between the two sets. I finally found someone with some knowledge and indeed the 750's use a different (more powerful) internal processor than the a650's. For how incredibly small the price difference is between the 650 and 750 I'm surprised people still shop the 650. Not to mention the regal-looking bezel on the 750, the woofer for those without a home theater system, and some other minor goodies. Bottom line, if you're flip-flopping between the two - stop. Just buy 750.2. What size? 52, 46, or even 40?Of course I wanted the largest size I could get. HD is a whole new ball game, and even a 52\" model is not as big as it sounds. In fact after having this for a couple weeks now I am beyond relieved I didn't buy a smaller size. (I typically sit about 7 feet from the screen.). Please take my word on this. You will never regret buying too big. Unless you're in a tiny dorm room, the 52\" will not overpower you. If you buy a smaller size just be warned you will be longing for the 52 before too long.3. Samsung or Sony 41 series?I went to 3 different big box stores to compare side by side. The picture on the 750 just blows away anything else in these stores. It's amazing how two sets with similar specs can have such different displays. The gloss finish just has the colors and contrast jumping off the screen. Sony makes solid products in general, but so does Samsung. It took only a matter of seconds to realize that the Sony 41 series has a boring picture compared to the 750.4. Plasma or LCD?With the glossy screen and various black adjustments in the menu, you're getting the best of both worlds with the 750. It has contrast like that of a higher end plasma, but also performs beautifully in a well lit room. Plasmas are just plain dim and dull. With how bright and vivid the 750's screen is, I have not had any issues with reflections. If you look at the models offered by most companies, it's clear that plasma is dying just as DLP is.5. The \"halo effect\"Non-existant. I've watched HD cable, games, and blu-rays in a pitch black room and cannot see the supposed halo that some people are whining about. In fact, I'm almost disappointed because I wanted to see what the hubbub was all about. Apparently Samsung has eliminated this.6. Amazon or a partner seller?Local big box stores sell this unit for (including tax) anywhere from $500 - $800+ more. Insane. I knew I'd be ordering it from Amazon. But sometimes the partner sellers are cheaper...what to do. It just so happened that the day I ordered it Amazon had the lowest price. But had they not, I still would have paid the extra small price difference to get it from Amazon. I have no experience with the partner sellers but felt I'd have more recourse with Amazon if a problem occurred.7. Gaming performanceI also bought a PS3 and Xbox 360 at the same time. Both are stunning, and nope, no input lag on either system using very inexpensive HDMI 1.3 cables. (However, I've read of people's feedback on the a650 where they have experienced lag. This is where the superior processor of the 750 comes in). I've played fast-paced shooters, racing, and adventure games with no lag issues. I may have had a minor lag issue with SOF on the 360 but that could just be the game. Games on the 52a750 will have you hypnotized, especially if it's your first foray into HD.8. SoundCould care less. I'm using a home theater system, but with the 750's woofer I'm sure the sound is good/great for a flat panel unit.9. Light and glare from the glossy finishHas not been an issue for me. At all.10. Final thoughtsComcast HD (via Motorola box), PS3 Blu-Ray, PS3 games, Xbox 360 games all look incredible. I sometimes watch content that I'd otherwise be bored with just because of the gorgeous picture. Plasma has nothing on the a750 and gaming is lag-free via HDMI. Buy this TV and your friends (especially those owning plasmas) will be envious if not outright jealous.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Screen Frame Glass Concerns", "Author": "H. Miller \"hanahal\"", "ReviewID": "R3J7WF75PMV8O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was bouyed by what others have written in their reviews as well as my own experience as to what I saw in the stores when deciding what TV to buy.So when I received this model TV I was anticpating an amazing experience with my first High Definition television. At first I was blown away by the picture. But then, when I started to watch a movie at night when the room was dark, I noticed that the clear beveled edge glass of the frame was reflecting light back at me and it was very distracting.I found that if I shifted myself higher in my seat by as little as a few inches, the reflection at the top disappeared. But I still saw the reflection on the sides. But do I have to sit at a perfect angle and location in the room to fully enjoy a not so cheap TV?I called Samsung technical support and the person I spoke to said that yes, they were aware of this problem but that it was not a large enough concern to them to change the design to correct.They recommended that I consider exchanging the 750 for the 650 series whose only difference was a few features as the 650 does not have this design flaw.So while the picture is fantastic, I can hardly rate this TV very highly when I have to put black tape around the glass frame to hide the reflections.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Please Forgive Me, Sony", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2EIN5V6OYW409", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In 1986, I was fortunate to have Sony's first HDTV cameras, recorders and projection system in the studio where I worked. Yes, that was 22 years ago and the technology was analog. But it looked great and we projected it on a screen 6 or 7 feet tall. Still, I wondered, why would anyone buy this new technology for \"just twice\" as sharp a picture?Jump to 2008. During the last 6 months, I watched as specialists installed my new all HD studio where I work now. This time, of course, it is digital. It's also Sony all the way and the recording media is Blu-ray, so I'm getting pretty familiar with the new generation of Sony HD, but was still watching the \"old 525 line NTSC\" stuff at home because I hadn't seen anything on display at any stores that was that magic combination of \"high end; low price\".Then, a couple months ago, we bought a 50\" Sony Bravia for our conference room at work and I hooked up a brand new Sony PS3 to it. The picture was beautiful and I decided to see if it was time to buy one for home use.Online reviews were very good for the Sony and I had already decided that an LCD would be better for home than a plasma after seeing how both held up at work. So, a little over a week ago, I checked everything they had at the local Best Buy. The salesman there agreed with me that the Sony was about as good as it gets. Then, surprising me, he said he'd buy the Samsung 7 series over the Sony. I asked him about price; $3,050 he quoted. The there would be a 9.25% sales tax, too.I went home and read the specs on the Sony and the Samsung only to discover that the Series 7 seemed better than the Bravia. And a side-by-side in-store comparison made the Samsung look very impressive. I checked more online sources and found that the new Samsungs, like the Sonys, were highly regarded.Research done, I checked Amazon's price. At $2,724, I would save almost $600, so I ordered one. I've spent the last 3 days installing it and all the associated audio stuff, PS3 and DVD burner in a custom cabinet. It looks great turned off, but when you turn it on and fire up the Blu-Ray (\"Planet Earth-The Complete Series\") which got here the same day, I was just blown away!I have learned several things: the Hi Def stuff is great, but the SD stuff from Dish and local analog broadcasts isn't as satifying on the new Samsung as on the old CRT. You can sit a lot closer to a 52\" screen than I thought - about 12' is our viewing distance. New TVs, and this one in particular, do a lot more than just display video - and do it well. Like a computer, this TV can crash. It's happened just once and it had to be \"rebooted\" by disconnecting the power.Also, I am really pleased with how Amazon handled the whole purchase. Everything, including delivery went smoothly. But here's the most surprising thing: A couple days after ordering the unit, Amazon dropped the price (temporarily, it seems). So, I emailed customer service and requested that they credit my account with the difference. That was on a Sunday nite. The next morning I had two emails from them. The first said they would review the situation and the second said they had already credited my account with $190. Service doesn't get any better!!!Update 6-21-08We have subscribed to Comcast cable since my initial review. We also got the HD-DVR and the HD channels. Cable, to my surprise, renders SD pictures slightly better than the Dish, however, I am now connected through HDMI instead of Y/C. That means a digital input instead of an analog hookup. I am still disappointed with 4:3 analog stuff compared to our older CRTs. Even digital 4:3 (480i) content looks unacceptable. However, all true HD stuff (including 720i)is good to fabulous.It is so good, in fact, that something you start to notice when watching HD content (especially network news) is just how all the different recording formats display on your new TV relative to one another. Footage shot in the field, for example, often looks really awful when on-screen with the studio cameras (as when the anchor is on one side of the picture - split screen - and a field reporter is on the other). Likewise, all older analog 4:3 stuff which has been upconverted for HD looks pretty grim, as do over-the-air broadcasts whether shot on film or tape originally.On the other hand, this LCD makes a wonderful (huge) computer screen and I don't see how you could expect more for games and/or Blu-ray movies. You will probably be disappointed with upconverted DVDs, however, (played, in this case, on a PS3).Most users will probably be confused with the unending list of menu items, and frankly, adjustments like \"gamma\" will simply confuse most people, especially when you have multiple levels of \"dynamic\" adjustments, \"black\", \"contrast\" and other controls which tend to be interactive and produce similar results. You can, quite literally, drive yourself nuts trying to get everything tweaked. On the other hand, if you're really picky (like, say, you color adjust photo prints for a living), you should be able to dial in nearly what you want on a good 1080 source.The built in speakers just don't sound very good and are slightly \"out-of-sync\" with the analog (RCA) outs, so if you have both the TV and an external receiver turned up, you will hear a distinct delay echo. It's my understanding that this is better with the digital outs, but I do not yet have the gear to test it.The most surprising thing I'm learning by using this latest LCD technology is just how uneven is this transition from analog to digital. It looks like it will be literally years before most of the legacy content is converted to HD digital (and how do you improve the quality of stuff shot on 16mm film in 1944, or TV series shot live in the studio in the sixties so that it will look great in HD?). Well, the answer is, of course; \"You don't.\"A few folks have commented on the very reflective screen surface and surround. I do, in fact, find the reflections(we have this TV in a room with windows on both walls perpendicular to the screen) slightly objectional when compared to the Sony with a more matte finish. Room lamps can, likewise, be problematic. We find the best solution (in the evening, at least) to be indirect lighting from a not-very-bright source that adds some illumination to the room but no direct reflections on the screen.Is now the time to buy HD? Frankly, I was holding out for OLEDs, but this current level of technology is just mature enough and affordable enough to jump in now. Prices on LCDs are coming down fast and the next generation of technology won't be cheap for some time to come. If you have been waiting for the right time to ditch your CRT, now is a great time - especially with the switch to all digital transmission in Feb '09.", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV but the extra features are not so good", "Author": "PorkChopExpress", "ReviewID": "R3AGK9FXRNXKK7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a TV I cannot complain. The 1080p resolution is great. The 120hz update rate is amazing. Watching television, playing games, and watching movies is very enjoyable.So all the fundamental reasons for me getting a new TV are met, however all the 'extra' features come up a little short. The DLNA feature currently useless for me. The Samsung server software can only host videos and pics that are on your local harddrive. I have all my stuff on an external harddrive. TVersity currently does not play well w/ the tv either. Hopefully Samsung or someone will release a better DLNA server app.The RSS feeds to the television are nice, but are not configurable. So the only feed you can get is from usa today.PIP is only possible with analog signals, meaning you cannot watch two HDMI inputs are the same time. (Who has a 52 inch 1080p tv and watches 2 analog inputs?)The sound system is not great. Eventhough it comes with a (or extra) woofer, the sound is about the same as any other tv out there. I dont really notice a difference. I havent heard the sound from the 650 series, but I cant imagine that there is that much difference.So overall I am pleased with the purchase because all of my requirements were met, but all the 'bells and whistles' came up short. I probably would have been just as happy with 650 series, but amazon had such a great price (low price, free shipping, no tax) on this one I cant really complain. If you are looking to save a few bucks get the 650. I am crossing my fingers that there will be in the near future a firmware update which will resolve the DLNA and RSS feed issues. If this becomes the case I will REALLY be pleased with the TV.The one thing I really prefer over the 650 is the touch of color on the 750 goes around the entire tv, whereas the 650 only has it on the top and bottom. This is purely aesthetic reason and it can only be seen in a well lit room.On a side note, CEVA delivered the TV 6 days earlier than the expected arrival date. The TV was ordered on thursday and it was in my house by the next week friday (6 days). I live in california and the TV originated from the east coast.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "The COMPLETE Review of the Samsung LN52A750", "Author": "N. Feathers", "ReviewID": "R2A789NHKLODY4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a person that has researched into buying a great HDTV for 3 ENTIRE YEARS, I would love to contribute a full and thorough review for this TV so EVERYBODY can see and fully understand this TV.  I will talk about my methodology in purchasing this particular TV at the end.  I decided to pull the trigger and purchase the 52\" size of the A750 model on 1/1/09(Thurs).  The order goes through like any other Amazon order does.  Amazon provides you with tracking information via their website, HOWEVER I would suggest using your specific carrier's website to get DETAILED tracking information.  If you copy and paste your order/tracking number from the Amazon tracking page, and copy and paste it in your carrier's tracking service your order should come up and be MUCH more specific and updated.  For example, my carrier was Pilot Freight and their website is [...]  My package left a warehouse in Hebron, KY and was set for delivery to my address in Columbus, OH.  On 1/6/09, I received a call from Pilot Freight(the carrier) to set up a date and time for delivery.  I was given 4-hr windows for delivery of 10-2, 11-3, and 12-4.  I could have had the TV delivered on 1/7/09, but scheduled for Thursday(1/8/09) instead.  I was told the time I opted for that I could only have 1 guy deliver, that I would have to help him, and that I could not receive \"white glove service\".  I was told this ahead of time, and the white glove service was available if I opted for other times.  I simply had no problem and really didn't need the \"white glove service\"(as I will describe later).  The driver called me 30 minutes before he arrived at my house, and when he arrived, he took the TV box and lowered it off the back of a standard freight box truck, carted it to the my house, and he helped me carry it in from there.  I signed the papers and that was that.  Here is a picture of what your box will look like.[...]  Now, I want everybody to understand what most white glove service is.  You will have 2 men arrive and carry the TV to a location in the house that you want.  They will then unbox the TV and place it on the stand, plug it in just to make sure it works, and then leave.  The exceptions are deliveries in cold weather.  They may opt to not turn the COLD TV on until it warms up to room temperature.  Also, they do not stick around for you to \"test out\" the TV or hook cable vision up in most cases.  That's not their job or service.  All they do is plug in the TV and make sure it turns on.  I don't want anybody to have any unweary expectations or feel unsatisfied by the service.  Some delivery guys may be more gracious and allow you to do so, but they don't HAVE TO.  All in all, my TV was delivered in tip top shape, delivery guy was nice, and everything went according to plan.  Being cold in Columbus, OH, I allowed the TV to warm up for about 45 minutes.  There is some debate as to whether or not you NEED to, but I would rather be safe than sorry, plus basic chemical properties of Liquid Crystal would suggest it would want to solidify more with the cold, so I played it safe.  After the TV warmed up, I unboxed the TV by tearing one of the attached sides and sliding it out the side of the box.  This is not necessary though, especially if you want to save the box if you get a defected TV.  On the bottom of the box in the middle is a black plastic insert that attaches to a box within the box.  If you can separate the box from the interior box, the main box you see from the outside simply lifts up and over the TV leaving the TV in it's much smaller box that it sits in. From there, you have a TV already attached to it's stand wrapped in a soft white film wrap, and an accessory bag wrapped in a plastic bag.  In the accessory bag, you have the remote, manual, warranty card, batteries, bottom cover, ferrite core clips, and a few other things.  The bottom cover confused most, but it is meant for those of whom want to wall mount their TV.  The plastic cover bottom piece is inserted in the portion where the TV stand would be taken out of.  The ferrite core clips are intended to be clipped around your HDMI cables near the TV to prevent interference from the other nearby cables(This is shown in the first couple pages of the manual).For those people that want an early look at the manual, they can check it out online to get an idea of what do when the TV arrives:[...]  You insert your power cord, cable line, HDMI cables, and hit the power button on the remote.  You will hear a melody telling you the TV is on, then the TV will run you through the initial setup.  After that, you hit the \"source\" button the remote and choose what source you want the TV to display.  I hooked my 52A750 up and was truly impressed.  I had a PS3 already and hooked it up to the TV via HDMI, and played Wall-E and Transformers on Blu-ray disk.  The picture needed quite a bit of adjusting out of the box, but it was still gorgeous.  Before explaining more, I will point out some differences between the A650 and A750:-750 has an integrated woofer-16-bit processor vs. 12-bit in 650 (10-bit panel in both)-750 has DLNA features (can stream audio/video/etc. over a home network)-750 can play video off of DLNA/USB flash drive. 650 limited to images/audio-750 comes with 1GB internal flash memory pre-loaded with HD pictures, games, recipes, and a few other things-750's controls on the bezel have a red backlight. 650's controls have no backlight[...]-750 has a square bezel compared to the 650's rounded bezel-750 has a square stand compared to the 650's oval stand-750 stand does not swivel (contrary to Samsung's literature)  I chose the A750 over the A650 for a couple reasons.  The A750 had what was in my opinion, a more attractive bezel.  There is more of a clear portion around the edge, then the red touch of color, then the black bezel itself.  The A650 has more of a a beveled and rounded bezel with a chromillusion touch of color scheme.  I also prefered the square bezel on the A750 more.  The other reason I chose the A750 was the addition in 2 extra woofers(not subwoofer) speakers in the back up the set to provide extra mid range bass as I am using the TV without any other audio hookups.  DLNA is useful for those of whom want to use it.  Also, you can put movies on thumbdrives and insert the thumbdrive to the TV to watch movies from the thumbdrive, which is something the A650 can't do.  For the small extra price at the time, it seemed perfectly normal for me to choose the A750 instead with all the little extra perks.  The picture quality of my set is great.  The blacks are the best you can possibly get from a non-LED LCD set.  The blacks are not as good as a Pioneer Kuro, but a Kuro also costs significantly more.  Motion handling is great as well with the Auto-Motion Plus feature.  There is some confusion that Auto-Motion Plus IS 120Hz for the TV.  The TV is ALWAYS 120Hz regardless of what setting AMP is on.  AMP simply creates a synthetic image between 2 actual frames of footage and plays the synthetic image in between frame 1 and 2 on the screen for a smoother image.  One bigger plus of AMP is that it creates an even more 3 dimensional look to images.  Wall-E on Blu-ray looks like an ACTUAL 3D box.  The depth of the image is great.  Some people may not like Auto-Motion Plus, as the 3D capability creates what many call a \"soap opera effect\".  If you have seen a soap opera on TV and notice how it tries to portray scenes in real life, as opposed to your typical movie film, you will know what I am talking about.  A great at home example, would be to look at an area, and then actually focus on one 3D object such as a chair and you can see how it focuses on 3D qualities of the chair while being more out of focus with the rest of the area.  It's all where your focus is.  While watching Transformers, Megan Fox appears to \"pop out\" of the screen around the surrounding area and Starscream does as well when he transforms out of the F22 to his robotic form in the city.  Personally, I love the AMP.  It presents a 3D image for what you are watching through the screen.  There are some moments when you actually think something may pop out of the screen.  Color accuracy of the set is top notch.  Movie Mode with color setting on Warm 1 are pretty close to real life, however the TV provides quite an array of options for you to tweak.  I do have some quarrels with the settings though as \"Game mode\" is fixed at backlight 7, which is incredibly bright at night time, plus some other settings are fixed at certain modes. However, I typically only use Movie and Dynamic Modes and they give me a good selection of tweaks to use.  At night time, I usually never go past backlight 2 in my 12x12 room as it is incredibly bright from such a large screen.  Shadow detail is one of the hardest things to obtain on this TV and most all other TVs.  For one, however the video quality is recorded in the first place makes a big difference.  However, I did tend to have flooded black scenes with little detail.  I am actually still trying to get the \"best\" out of the TV, but by upping a few contrast settings and keeping the deep blacks, yet increasing the brightness of the detail, I have pretty good shadow detail now.  I find it to be more of me being nit picky at this point as HDTV is spoiling me.  Standard definition with a digital cable box is quite bad as you can imagine.  This isn't so much the TV, but just how big TVs on standard definition look.  I watch almost exclusively HD channels now, so SD channels are not a big deal for me.  The SD content is tolerable, and at times with the TV upscaling the SD image can look quite good in 4:3 picture size.  The content feature of the TV is kind of a needless nick-nack feature they threw in that includes recipes, fitness, games, and pictures pre-loaded on the TV.  It is sometimes nice though to set it to some of the gallery clips when you just want the TV on and want images and music being played by the TV off to the side.  The remote is a pretty basic remote.  It has a rather annoying, yet useful scrolling wheel that you move with your finger to select options.  Sometimes it is useful, but since the \"Enter\" button is right in the center of it, it can become cumbersome at times.  Also, the remote does not have a PIP button which would be handy, although the TV does have PIP on it.  I can pretty much guarantee game lag is around 20ms or so, however I have noticed none whatsoever, and am just going off broad tests by fellow reviewers.  Bottom line, I notice no game lag when I play Dynasty Warriors 6 and GT5.  The screen is a semi-gloss screen meaning it does have glare.  I do not notice the glare even with 3 large bay windows just to the right of the TV in a 12x12 room.  However, if you have windows right behind your TV, I suggest maybe considering the A630 with the semi-matte screen.  I opted for the A750 because Sony's and the A630's semi-matte screens lack just a bit of pop that the semi-gloss screen on the A750 provides.  The bezel around the screen is quite glarey, but gorgeous to look at.  Many people don't like the touch of color with the TV.  I also notice many misunderstand the touch of color on the A750.  On the A650, the touch of color resembles chromillusion paint and shows touch of color where the light reflects off of it.  This is not the case with the A750.  The bezel itself is piano black, but at the edge is the red touch of color, then the clear part of the bezel.  Here is a picture to indicate what I am talking about:[...]40 inch next to 52 inch:[...]The touch of color is extremely subtle for those who do not like it(I love it).  In a dark room, it is non-existent, and in a bright room, it is a nice subtle shade of red around the edge.  For all intensive purposes, when you walk into my bright room and see the TV, you immediately think it's black until you see the small, subtle shade of red around it.  For those people that think the touch of color is TOO subtle, you can always place a light behind the TV to illuminate the bezel more like this:[...]Contrary to many people's beliefs, the bezel DOES NOT light up like a lot of people mistakenly think.  There is a \"defect\" on the A750 set called the \"halo\" in which light from the screen is refracted up towards the clear edge of the bezel and illuminates it right at the edge.  Here are some pics of this \"defect\".  If you look closely you can see the light around the edge of the bezel:[...]This is the most common \"defect\" and happens on most sets, including mine, but I don't really view it as a \"defect\".  I find it asthetically pleasing personally, and it doesn't distract me in the least.  Many people find it distracting, but if it's distracting you must not be watching what's on the TV.  It's not a big deal in my opinion at least.  Some sets have flashlighting or clouding which is typical for all LCD TVs.  A bad set would have flashlighting and clouding in dark content from the sides(usually).  My set has a little flashlighting in the top left and middle right edge, but it is not noticeable when anything is being displayed other than a pitch black picture(like an all black background picture).  I do not notice it in any movie content, night scenes, etc. so it is somewhat of a null issue for me. Each technology has it's own little issues.  LCDs have flashlighting and clouding, and blur(I notice barely any on the A750) while plasmas have ghosting, dithering, and potential burn-in(even though it's been practically nullified).  The TV does occasionally pop and jump around when you change the HDMI source from the cable box to my PS3, but I'm used to it and it's a minor annoyance.  The audio on the TV is great from what I've heard.  The bass tends to defeat the standard sound(like theatres), however the sound quality is great from what I've heard.  Incredibly loud too as 50% of the max sound while watching Transformers was shaking my windows.  There is a Hz equalizer in the settings menu to custom change the audio sound, and SRS Tru-Surround sound is an option to turn on as well.  The speakers fire downwards and out the back of the TV, so I suppose the sound is a little distorted and sounds distant compared to face firing speakers, but for a stand alone TV, I think it sounds great, and with the TV parallel to a wall in an octagon shaped room, the acoustics work for me nicely.  All in all, I'm thrilled with the purchase.  Everything has worked out and the TV is absolutely gorgeous whether it is playing content on screen or sitting in the room turned off.  Unless you have the budget for a Pioneer Kuro, A950, or XBR8 of the same size, I would highly recommend the A750 if you think it suits your needs.---I researched HDTVs for 3 years before deciding on a 52A750.  I visited 12 different Best Buy, Circuit Citys, and HHGreggs multiple times each before making my decision to buy through Amazon.  When looking at an HDTV in store, don't just look for one that grabs your eye as the \"best picture\".  Remember most all of the TV manufacturers set the TV as bright and unrealistically colorful as possibly to draw your eye to it in the store.  Play with the TVs and setting and THEN start judging.  After doing so, do it at multiple locations, as some sets may be worn down, defective, or just have a bad HD feed into them.  Play with the TVs and try to get a picture that you are happy with.  The AVS guys at [...] provide GREAT information on these HDTVs including personal reviews, comparisons, calibration settings, and whatever else you can think of on HDTVs. Amazon has been great to deal with and the purchase was seamless, and I'm enjoying my 52\" A750 in my living room right now.", "Date": "January 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Too Awesome for words", "Author": "D.

Khokhani", "ReviewID": "R2N44P7SD4DNB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV Grade: A-Pros:- HD Picture Quality: As I say below, this is my first LCD TV, but I've seen many in my years and the PQ is excellent, especially considering the price. The blacks look great, the colors pop, and once I played with the picture settings, it looked even better- SD Picture Quality: For a 52\" LCD the standard definition picture is very good. While obviously not as good a CRT or a non-HD-LCD, it still is excellent.- No issues (at least on mine) with clouding, mura, banding, pillaring, etc- Viewing angle is excellent- Look of the bezel- Glossy screen isn't as reflective as my old CRT- Lots of picture adjustments- General connectivity (DNLA, Wiselink, Infolink, etc)Cons:- Only one HDMI input that does anything by switching it to PC- Remote and more importantly the remote UI is poorly conceived. Example: No button for changing AMP settings, and getting to PIP is convoluted.- A lot of the picture adjustments are limited to certain input types and/or modes- Bezel is very easy to scratch- DNLA limits on codecs allowed- No wireless DNLA- Auto energy-saving setting needs a little workPotential benefits/concerns, but not necessarily a pro or a con, IMO:- LagIt's been discussed a lot in this thread. It will bother some, others won't notice it, and depending on the settings, lag can be extremely minimized. At the end it's up to the owner.- HaloBasically in a dark room a little light emits from the edges of the bezel creating a 'halo' over the TV. Some like it, some really dislike it, some don't even notice it. Decide for yourself. It is rare that I watch anything in pitch black, but when I have it hasn't bothered me. There is a solution for those that do have an issue with it but like the TV otherwise.- Touch of Color (TOC)The red bezel. I like it, my wife likes it and to both us we don't notice it that much. Again to each their own. The biggest thing with the bezel is how easily it's surface can get scratched, even with a soft microfiber cloth.- Short SummaryI really enjoy the TV and everything it offers. The picture quality positive easily outweighs any (and all) of the negatives the TV has, by itself.Slightly longer reviewPreface:This is my first LCD screen. I've waited 2 years to buy one, mainly because I never saw a TV I liked. . . . Saw a review on the 650 and knew the 750 was out. Went to the local store and saw the 750 and really liked it. I waited a few weeks, maybe a month, and finally took the plunge of buying a TV via Amazon.Ordering and delivery:Simple.The order was delayed a few days from the original estimated ship date of the 22nd of May - the day I ordered it - to the 27th, because of some random reason.TV shipped on the 4th. Amazon's system had the TV reaching the local CEVA warehouse on the 5th, but Amazon's system was incorrect. I used CEVA's system and they were right on with their estimate.CEVA came to the house, unboxed the TV, placed it on my stand, let me hook up my computer via a DVI>HDMI cable to see if I had any dead pixels and/or glaring issues. None. They left. Very courteous.Aesthetics:One of the reasons I bought the 750 over the 650 is because the bezel. I like the squared off bezel of this better then the rounded one of the 650. It wasn't a big difference, but the price difference of the two models when I got the 750 was negligible.The downside of the TOC is how easily the bezel can get scratched. The TV has been in my possession for about 3 weeks and it already has 2 scratches on it from just getting wiped down. The bezel seems to collect dust rather quickly, while the screen does not.Before I bought the TV I had heard how most LCDs have a reflective screen to bring out add more pop, but the reflectiveness was a distraction. I already was coming from a CRT which was pretty reflective, which I didn't like at all. To my surprise the LN52A750 is less reflective then my CRT and doesn't distract from my viewing, even during the day.The 'halo' is only visible when it is dark and at 10 feet from the TV, my eyes don't see it when I'm watching TV. Some might not like it, but I don't think it is an issue. Go to a store and check it out yourself to see if you like it or not.The Nuts and Bolts:- Picture QualityWow! In one word.The picture quality is pretty great. Out of the box the TV's settings were pretty good, but once I played with the settings, it was even better.I don't have a bluray or hi-def DVD player, just an older progressive scan player (not even one of those upconverting ones). But DVDs on that player look great. One day I'll get a bluray player and I'll be even happier.Comcast HD looks wonderful, with basketball games really showing what the TV does. No TBE (triple ball effect) at all.The standard def, is very good too. Not CRT quality, but better then what I've seen out of most, if not all LCDs.The TV has a lot of picture options that one can play with. There are certain limitations, as Samsung has limited what can be changed on certain inputs/modes, but hopefully that will be corrected in future FW updates. But the abundance of settings options should allow the TV to be set to appease anyone's eyes.- On-screen menu and remote UIThe remote is lacking in a lot of ways. Not in the design itself, but the lack of being able to 1-touch things like Auto Motion Plus, Picture-in-Picture, brightness, etc without going into the menus, sometimes delving much deeper into a menu than would make sense.The menus themselves are fine and easily navigable, but it just takes too many steps to get to certain pieces that should be easier to switch quickly.Also there is a lack of being able to program certain buttons on the remote (namely the colored buttons) based on what the user needs. In this day and age you would figure having at least a few programmable buttons would be commonplace.- ConnectsThe four HDMI's are nice. What isn't nice that they all seem to act a tad differently from one another. For example labeling HDMI4 (the one on the side) as a PC does nothing and it seems to act a bit slower to begin with. But HDMI2, when labeled PC, completely eliminates process, hence lag (at least in my tests).The TV handles the switching fine, but the lack of being able to do the same thing to any of the HDMI's is a mistake.This might have more to do with the Movie Mafia - MPAA - but not allowing 5.1 out via optical seems wrong and a tad limiting.- SoundTo tell you truth, except for my first turn on and off of the TV, I haven't listened to the internal speakers as everything is going through my receiver, so I can't say much about it.- As a computer monitor, streaming, etcI haven't tried DNLA yet, as I need to get a wireless bridge, but I have hooked up my laptop to the TV numerous times.Initially I had hooked it up to HDMI4 and the results were okay. I had trouble playing certain files through that port (namely quicktime ones). But I moved the input to HDMI2 labeled it PC and everything played on the TV just fine. I even removed the PC label and everything played just fine and I had no sound lag either.If being used just as a monitor, text is clear and legible even from 10 feet away. From up close the text is smooth too.- UniformityFirst thing I did was test for dead pixels and any obvious defects when CEVA dropped the TV off. Nothing seemed to stand out.I then tried a lot of different files, movies, etc and nothing wrong stood out again.And then I ran TVBlink.com's DVD and only one minor thing stood out, but I think it was source related more then anything else. On the Color Antialiasing test, the circles are to be smooth. Two of my circles (purple and blue) had rolling hills, not steps. It changed when I used my computer's DVD instead of the standalone one.Nothing else really stood out.No pillaring, no clouding/mura, no flashlights, etc. I'm sure there are some irregularities some might notice, but my wife, a few friends, and I haven't seen anything so that is good enough.- Gaming/LagI only have the Wii. And I've noticed no discernible lag when playing games on it in any mode (Game mode, Standard mode, etc) all played the same for me.I had run tests out of curiosity's sake more then for any other reasons. Yes, there is lag on this TV, but it is highly dependent on your settings and what you can live with and can't live with.There was 0ms lag when I labeled HDMI2 to PC (8 tests - 8 @ 0ms). Game mode gave me a lag of 20ms to 30ms (9 tests - 3 @ 20ms, 6 @ 30ms). Extremely acceptable numbers for an LCD TV of this magnitude and standard mode's lag with AMP at low was generally clocked between 50ms and 70ms (8 tests 4 @ 50ms, 2 @ 60ms, 2 @ 70ms). A little higher.The outcomes are based solely on my tests, on my TV, using my equipment. Others might have varying results.- Audio/LagI have not encountered audio lag. As mentioned I have only used the TV speakers once or twice. Sound was in sync then. The rest of the time all sound is run through my receiver and the sync is perfect then too.I do have my standard cable input into the TV with RCA audio out to the receiver and there is no audio lag there either.- HaloWell it's there, but not a concern on my part. I barely notice it, and when I do it's because I am looking for it.- Power on input delayThis actually hadn't been in my mind until someone else brought it to my attention. If you are switching inputs from the TV Off status, it takes a little bit - actually 13000ms from the time the TV turns on and the input is switched to the appropriate one. Not sure why, but it can be a mild annoyance.Final ThoughtsI really love the TV. I haven't hesitated to recommend this TV to anyone I know and one person did buy it and they are extremely happy with their purchase.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Absolutely STUNNING Styling and Picture Quality", "Author": "B.

Martin", "ReviewID": "R2RDYXBQE3ONZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had wanted to buy a wall mounted 52\" LCD TV for a couple of years now but I could not get past the screen blur (pixelating) caused by fast moving scenes.  Finally 120hz came along and virtually elimated the screen blur.  With 120hz in the mix I decided to take the plunge and purchase a TV.  I went to BB and CC to look at their line-ups and I went to the Tv with the best picture: Both places led me to Samsung LN52 models.  More research led me to the LN52A750 model.  The poorest reviews given to it were based on the screen reflection on the inner bezel (inside lip of the TVs outer frame).  This has been dubbed by reviewers as \"the Halo Effect\".  I went back to both CC and BB and looked closely for this effect.  I did notice it.  It was very obviuos.  However, I don't watch TV from the edge of the screen to the middle so it did not concern me that much.  It however is there and could be annoying to some.  It is very noticable in a dark room while watching bright scenes. Check it out at a store to see if it is tolerable for you or you will be disappointed if you buy this set.  Note: I took my wife along and she noticed this effect on all the LCD TVs to some extent regardless of brand.  I searched on-line and decided to buy from Amazon because of its low price, free shipping, and very bonus NO TAX transaction.  I saved over $500+ by buying from amazon.  I was worried about making a major purchase like this on-line.  However, with many positive reviews from amazon customers about deliveries and consumer reports high rating of amazon as a retailer of major appliances, I felt pretty good about it.  I ordered the Tv June 30th and was delivered July 6th to my living room.  The two guys delivering it had me sign and they busted out the door...So much for white glove deliver service!  I opened it. no problems, no big deal.  The outer bezel is very scratchable and I wanted to take my time mounting it anyways. It wasn't very heavy but awkward to lift carefully.  Set-up was easy.  I just plugged in all the cords and it was ready to go.  Now that I have had this TV for over a month now I have noticed a few things (good and bad) that I really wasn't clear on before I bought this TV.  First the bad:  The entire outer frame is very reflective.  Daytime viewing with alot of light indirect or direct can be annoying.  The screen is also very reflective however direct light seems to annoy me most.  I only notice the indirect light when a dark scene is depicted.  The audio is only output to 5.1 if the TV program is 5.1.  I am not that technical but the jist is that if you input by HDMI ex.playstation3 then the sound sent out to your receiver from the TV is only 2 channel.  To get 5.1 you need to run a seperate cord from your PS3 or other component directly to your receiver.  This seemed a design flaw but it is apparently digital rights mgmt junk.  The outer 1/8 inch of the entire frame is clear.  Sometimes while watching a bright scene at night light hits the edge and it illuminates or reflects.  This may be the \"the halo effect\" some are talking about instead of the inner screen reflections.  It looks cool but it can be distracting at times.  The remote stinks.  It is not a learning remote; so it only controls the TV and other select Samsung components I don't have.  The wheel on it is so touchy it is useless.  Also the remote has to be pointed exaggeratingly directly at the TV to work properly.  My harmony remote, from the same distance, doesn't have this problem.  I expected a much better remote with this TV  The TV is wireless ready meaning another optional $$$ purchase is needed to make it work.  The bonus content on the internal memory is read-only.  You can not add to or delete it.  Similar content can be downloaded from samsung.com to a thumb drive and displayed on the TV but it again can not be added to the memory of the TV.  Basically what is on the TV will be on there forever???  Finally the codecs supported by the TVs software is limited.  I have my computer hooked up to the TV via a DVI to HDMI cable and the supplied server software installed.  Only 1/4th of my videos are playable on the TV.  Either I have to convert my files or skip playing them.  Now the Good:  The picture clarity and quality are truley amazing compared to other TVs.  I mean why would you look outside continually through a blurry dirty window if you didn't have to.  This Tv seems the clean window , the rest the blurry ones.  This is mostly why I had to buy a Samsung. Don't beleive me: Go to a store and pick out the clearest pictured TV and I bet it is a Samsung.  The 120hz makes for no noticable motion blur.  It has 3 settings,  I have yet to mess with them because I see no blur when watching baseball or football etc etc.  You can hook up to your router by wire to get news quotes, weather, and stock quotes from USA Today.  It is cool and probably can and will be expanded upon with later firmware updates.  Finally the greatest asset of this TV for me is that it can be used as a 52 inch computer monitor.  It is an awesome sight with my cordless keyboard and mouse,  surfing the internet, reading email, writing this review (ha ha)!  It was something I really didn't even think of before I bought this TV.  In short summary,  IF YOU HAVE READ THIS FAR OR ARE STILL AWAKE...This TV ROCKS!!!  The picture is awesomely clear, the price from Amazon without tax is the cheapest around,  the reviews are mostly high, and it makes one helk of a computer monitor.

I was drafting a detailed, not to mention, stellar review to post of my experience because when this TV works it is truly spectacular.  However, things did not go so well for me.  The downtime on this TV has been unimaginable.  Literally after 1 week, it sounded like something inside the TV was sizzling.  It seemed to come from the speakers.  Called Samsung for help, after a few days of 'no response' to their customer service request process, I was contacted and told the original repair center did not respond to them so, they gave it to another local shop, and 4 more days later a nice guy came, swapped a panel, and all seemed fine.  I was hesitant to go along with a repair and not insist on a replacement.  Well, don't you know... it worked fine, at least for about 5 weeks.  Then 15 minutes into our movie Friday night, pop.  Dead again, with a pulsating noise now, again from the speakers.  But no picture, nothing.  Dead as a doornail.After kicking myself for not insisting on the exchange at the first sign of trouble, instead of trusting in the 'authorized repair' process.  Seemed wasteful at the time.  Don't make that same mistake.  Especially after the results of the next call.  So, I called Samsung to report the lemon they sold me, as well as calling the repair center.  Bad enough that no one works customer service during a holiday weekend that can do anything.  So I have been staring at a black screen for days and getting more frustrated by the minute.  I will update further when I actually get some assistance...UPDATE: Reached the Executive Customer Relations Group, who after waiting 4 days to reach, I politely discussed the situation.  Well, they frankly couldn't be bothered with much of this.  They didn't seemed at all concerned that the TV is completely dead yet again and that this was unacceptable.  When a top of the line very expensive TV sounds like a bug zapper while the screen goes black, it is unnerving to the poor sap left holding the bag.I am floored at the low quality expectations here.  Not to mention, the agent was not at all empathetic, not at all concerned about this, as if we were discussing a disposable camera.  The most troubling part, they were not surprised in the least.  They seemed very routine to them to have a product with this level of poor performance.  I finally had to strongly insist just to get the rep to agree maybe some sort of proactive diagnostics should be done by the repairman, to perhaps make sure this is not a defective set (I must be crazy to suspect that!), in the hopes this will not happen again.So although I was ready to sing the praises for this TV, I am strongly regretting my trust in Samsung for this investment.  Unfortunately, as the saying goes, buyer beware.  More updates after the next repair.09/04 - Repair man took my 2 month old TV completely apart again and swapped out the same part, again.

Nguyen", "ReviewID": "RO47ZPCH9H3HP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this TV for a little over two weeks now, so I feel confident that I know enough to post a review of this product. First off, the IQ of this TV is absolutely beautiful. The color is rich and deep. It has more picture adjustment features than you could ever think of. I don't mess around with the picture setting because the picture quality is perfect to me. This TV also has a wireless feature that you can use to access files (movie, music, etc) from your PC, when you buy a separate wireless adapter from SAMSUNG that plugs into the USB port located on the side. You can access files from a USB memory stick if you like. I have my Sony Play Station 3 hooked up to this TV. I use the PS3 to view movies (blue ray movies look awesome), pictures (huge 52\" picture frame on the wall), music (all my music collection on disk), and browsing the internet (I can buy games online if I want). The PS3 and this TV make an awesome match. Oh and the sound is very good, I must admit. It won't match my $4000 audiophile music system in term of sound quality, but I don't have much space inside my bedroom. The red thing around the TV is....I just don't care since it is just a marketing gimmick.Now the things that I don't like. First, the remote could of been better. The rotating ring is an absolute joke. I cannot browse through the TV menus without problems when using this rotating ring. Sometimes, things that look innovative (like this rotating ring) turn out to be just a worthless gimmick. Samsung needs to get rid of this or make it better. There should be a sleep button on the remote. You can access the sleep timer, but you have to go through several steps. This is stupid on Samsung's part. Where's the picture mode (stretch, zoom, 16:9. etc) button? Again, you have to go through several steps to access this feature. The \"source\" button should be redesigned. All you should do when changing the input source is pressing the \"source\" button to cycle through all the input source. No need to press the \"source\" button to get to the input source that you want, then have to press the exit to get out of the display. Little things like this that Samsung completely failed to realize. Samsung should of chosen a better material for the bezel around the TV. It is too soft and easy to scratch (you will scratch it I guarantee). It also attract dust like crazy. The panel somehow is much better at not atracting dust.Other than those silly little things (OK they are annoying), I like this TV a lot. The picture IQ is simply marvelous. This TV deserves 4.5 stars.Update Jun 27:-I found another thing about the remote that I don't like. The Samsung engineer apparenty screwed up on programming the \"exit\" and \"return\" button. Certain menu item on the screen tell me to press the \"exit\" button to get out of that particular menu, but it turns out that I have to press the \"return\" button to get out. The \"exit\" button should let you get out of the menu, and the \"return\" button to let you get out of the submenu. Anyway, I am more than happy to use my Onkyo universal remote instead of this one and just forget about that \"exit\" button.-I know that this is a Samsung TV review, but the more I use my Sony Playstation 3, the more I am amazed about this TV set. You know that you can view the media files from your PC (set upi as the media file server) when you buy a separate wireless adapter that plugs into the USB port located on the side of the TV? This feature is called DLNA. Well, why should you if you have a Playstation 3 or a XBox 360 connected to the TV? The sight of that wireless thing sticking out on the side of your TV would be an eye sore. Instead, you can set up a media server on your PC and have the PS3 or Xbox receive all those files and display them on your beautiful TV. My PS3 only has 40 GB of disk space; my PC has over 2 TB of disk space. I don't have to store everything on my PS3. I can use the PS3 to retrieve all those files wirelessly from my PC and display them on my Samsung TV. If you have several DLNA-supported TVs in your house, then you can set up one PC media file server to feed your TVs anywhere inside your house. This DLNA is truely a great feature.

I try to always find something on the HD channels to watch before I go to the regular channels.  But even the 720p channels are pretty good.  I did calibrate the TV with the internet's help (before you spend the money on a professional or calibration CD try doing a search for samsung ln52a750 calibration...you'll find a lot of instruction on this).  Haven't tried blu-ray yet, but upconverted DVD looks awesome.Sound - people have said the sound isn't so great..i think it's not bad.  I hooked up an HDMI from my cable box to the TV and the sound hasn't been disappointing.  If you have a sound system this shouldn't be a concern (the TV has an optical audio out...so you can hook up everything to the TV and output the sound to your sound system).  If you don't have a sound system..i don't think you'll be upset by the quality (just my opinion).Appearance - this is a very nice looking set. It looks great in my apartment.  As for the TOC, it does not bother me or any of my friends that have seen it.  I don't even think I would have noticed it if it wasn't mentioned in reviews often.  The TV does produce a glare, but next time you go to a local electronics store to look at TVs notice that most of them have a glare!  Once the TV is on and you're watching anything, the glare becomes a non-issue.USB port - pretty cool.  I hooked my USB up to this which contained some JPEGs.  The pictures looked great.  This is just a cool concept...the fact that you can drag some pics onto a jump drive and look at them on your 52 inch TV.  Also, you can buy the wireless infolink USB which you plug into the port and get wireless news and weather.Interactive Content - this is completely not necessary, but pretty cool.  The TV comes preloaded with a lot of artwork, recipes, and stuff for kids.  You just click on a but on the remote and can chose one of the categories you'd like to see.  I can see that the artwork feature would be nice if you were having a party and wanted some background music and pictures.  But this is a little extra.Games - I have the Wii hooked up to the unit and it looks great.  The max resolution for the wii is 480p so don't expect HD viewing, but it's just fun to play on such a large screen with a great picture.TV as Computer monitor - realitvely good quality.  very easy to hook up my laptop to the TV with approriate cable.  This was an important issue for me as I can know watch Netflix movies from my laptop on the TV.  The quality is pretty good (will not be near HD..but nice to know that you have this option)Remote - this is probably the worst thing about the TV.  The setup is not user friendly.  The wheel that many have mentioned does not always work well.  But it's such a small thing.  I don't really use the remote except to turn the tv on and off and change the source.  The interactive content is accesible by the remote as well.Compared to Samsung LN52A650 - the 750 does not swivel, whereas the 650.  I've seen the picture quality on both and they are similar.  I did however like the look of the 750 much better (just has a nicer appearance, it's width is slightly bigger because of a thicker frame).  Otherwise the two are almost the same...so it's up to your preference.Ordering - try to order this TV from Amazon (check the line that says Sold by...).  the reason for this is free shipping and no tax (unless you're shipping to NY).  Plus the shipping is via CEVA.  I did pick up the TV from the warehouse.  But the guys there help me load the TV into the truck and were professional. Can't really comment on the in-home service.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Just Beautiful", "Author": "A.

The only complaint I would have is the \"halo\" issues on the edges. Basically the 1/8 inch edge of the frame can reflect the picture , and give the impression that the picture extends beyond the actual viewing space.  To see this , you need to be at a bit of an off angle from the TV (either horizontal or vertical) in a room that is not well lit.  For some people , it's not big deal,  others it bugs.  I haven't decided yet...but I am surprised Samsung didn't notice this quirk in their design process.

Early December 2009 I started to experience problems with the TV turning itself off and on.  At first it would do this for a minute or so and then stay on and work fine.  After several days of it doing this it just never came back on.  It would constantly turn itself off and on and i was forced to unplug the TV.  I went to Samsung's website and attempted their suggested work around.  Since the work around did not fix the problem it was recommended that I should open a service call.  I setup an appointment with the local service department that is affiliated with Samsung, they came out and in about an hour they fixed the problem.So what was the problem?  A pair of $4.00 25W capacitors which were replaced with 50W capacitors.  I spent $2,400.00 dollars on this TV and it breaks after less than 1 1/2 years?  This issue is not isolated to just me, there are plenty of people experiencing this issue.  Please see link on the [...] thread ([...]) or Google \"Samsung ln52a750 TV turning on and off\" to see all the other folks experiencing the problem.I spoke with Samsung customer support requesting that they cover the complete expense of the repair ($300.00) even though I was out of warranty.  It is my feeling that for the amount of money I paid for the TV it should not break in less than a year and a half.  I could have purchased a second tier brand like Vizio for half the price.  I thought I was getting not only a better TV from a technology stand point but also a better TV in terms of the quality of the components.Samsung refused to honor my request saying that the repair occurred outside of my warranty.  They said that if the part broke again they would cover that repair expense.  The repair tech installed a replacement part that was double the capacity of the original equipment!  What is the likeliness that the new capacitors would break?  I told them that refusing to honor my request would result in Samsung loosing me as a customer.  They told me that was my choice.  I told them that I would post warnings to friends on Facebook not to buy Samsung TV's because of their poor customer service and substandard parts.  They said that was my choice as well.I feel Samsung has totally dropped the ball on this.  They did not offer me any type of compensation for all the time and money I spent getting their shoddy TV fixed.  Saying your sorry can only go so far.  I have lost all respect for Samsung and will make sure I try to tell as many people as possible to go with Sony or some other brand for their TV purchases.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great price for a great product", "Author": "CBuck", "ReviewID": "R1P1D4UGAIYK8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been really happy with this TV.  It has plenty of connections and great quality.  You should read the manual carefully if you have any component connections because only one set on the TV has that function and it says composite on the back.There are some minor gripes but nothing to worry about.  The control system is a little slow.  When browsing menus sometimes it takes a while to respond but I'm picky when it comes to speed.  Some of the remote buttons like the jog wheel work better for a person who uses it slower and presses more firmly.  The volume and channel buttons squeak slighty but not in an unpleasant way.  The other downside of the remote is it is not universal.  I'm surprised a TV in this price range doesn't come with one.  I will be getting a Logitech Harmony soon anyway.As for picture quality HD sources are beautiful with correct properly saturated colors in my opinion.  Not oversaturated and overprocessed like Sony. Sometimes the upscaling of lower quality signals leaves something to be desired.  There are times when a person's face can seem a bit grainy or blocky.  This can be easily fixed by using a HD source and that is where this TV shines.  With HD sources this set is absolutely stunning.  Whenever there is a black part of a scene on this TV it just blends into the frame because it gets so dark.  As much I hate wasting screen real estate when you watch a letter box movie the last thing you want to see is a dark gray bar on the top and bottom of the TV distracting you.  This TV gets the black so black you don't even realize it there anymore.  Combine it with Blu-ray or other HD source and I am in heaven.  I love it.  Just keep in mind that this set, like other high contrast sets, uses a semi-glossy screen which can reflect so be careful of your light sources in the area.  It reflects about as much as a regular flat screen tube TV with standard glass, maybe a little less.Finally the audio is decent.  I have never been a fan of the built in audio on any TV but for those who don't worry that much about it the sound is just fine.  One thing I have discovered though is that the TV processes video faster than my amplifier processes sound.  Sometimes the TV can actually get ahead of my surround sound system and the words go out of sync.  This is easily fixed by pausing the video and starting it back.  It happens rarely and usually only when starting or fast forwarding a video.  This does not happen when using the built in sound.  Eventually I will purchase a surround sound system with HDMI passthrough which will remedy this situation but again this is not the TV's fault.  I am using my sound and video from different sources and different connections which is bound cause some problems.Overall I would say this TV has been worth every penny.", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung has a hit, software features need help", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "RAFLVSRYAX2B6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "TV picture is excellent, various functions are nice to have and device hook up is easy.All content used: Comcast Cable TV, iPod, Home PC (photos, music and videos), DVR and VCR all look great.

Art looks very good. Would be nice to access content updates from the internet, but so far only from USB, which I have not tried.Updating the firmware, done twice so far, is simple.One issue is the slow (sometimes very slow) ability to show photos when there are many photos on your PC. TV appears to be hung, but actually just cataloging. Samsung needs to fix this if they are really serious about multimedia. Would be nice if Apple music played. And why can't you play music with your photos? The included Media Server software is dismal, and I'm being kind. Use windows media player instead. And you can't find updated Samsung server software online.Hanging the unit was not fun. Recessed mounting holes don't match the mounting kits various screw sizes. Ended up using the long ones and used the spacers to make up the space. (this was a kit from Costco, great price) I suppose if I paid for a Samsung mount this would not have been an issue. Lifting the TV is difficult since the \"touch of color\" is just a plastic piece with no strength, and the TV itself has no secure handles.  I wonder how many people have dropped the unit or damaged the plastic border. Now that's its mounted though, it looks great.One last item, if you remove the power too long you lose your settings.Net, would buy this again.

I've never had such smooth events (2 now) from a delivery vendor. Both times ahead of schedule and everyone I've spoken with was polite and courteous.Now on to the LN52A750R1F... WOW!!!! And I cannot put enough exclamation points to say how impressed I am with this product. I did a lot of research before settling on this unit. Each time I looked at a model, I found myself reaching a little higher. Originally this was to be the 3rd and least used LCD units for our household. We were finally replacing the last of 3 old televisions. First I tested the waters with an impulse buy walking into a local retailer having, at that time, my favorite brand on sale, it was a Sony Bravia XBR KDL-32XBR4, only 32 and for the bedroom, what harm could it do, right? This unit took me hours to set-up and the lack of a crisp picture was disappointing. So when I was ready for the second replacement I did more homework. I shopped, reviewed, inspected, but mostly I watched, the pictures of my favorites. Still not knowing any better, I had Sony, Sharp and Samsung on the short list. This time shopping for a bit larger unit, 40 or there about. Well, Sony wasn't budging on prices, I discounted Sharp Aquos because the picture is again, no pun intended, not SHARP, but very muted. This is for the room we live in, our home office suite. This purchase has to be just right!Fortunately my local BB had the two finalists, Sony Bravia XBR KDL-40XBR5 & Samsung LNT4071F, on end caps within close proximity to each other. Both were great pictures, but only one was a great buy and with all things being equal and the difference of $1k was part of the deal, Samsung won hands down. Got it delivered home by Amazon white glove, and within minutes it was up and running, and I've had no regrets.Now enough with the history, I'm now a Samsung fan, and shopping for this LCD purchase, wasn't as critical as the last. There was only one brand to think about, but now there are so many models. This was to be a replacement for a unit we watch an hour a day, so 1st I started looking at the DLPs. Great price, but will be obsolete before long, next no need for another 1080p so why not a 720p Plasma? Great price, but maybe I can do better, what if in a couple of years we want to get that Blu-Ray, guess we should look at the 1080p's. So the 550s are at a good price point, but what's all this hype about the 6 series and now the 7 series? More research and pounding the pavement to get a glimpse of one. Finally found one at my local Fry's, just unpacking it. I WAS SOLD! I have to have this 6 or 7 series, the look is amazing, and we have lot's of Chinese and Asian \"stuff\" in this room, the red would POP! Then the price dropped on the 7 series to within a $100 dollars of the 6, I placed my order! Shipped on Tuesday, was told it would be here on the following Thursday (10 days later), got a phone call on this Thursday (2 days later), \"can we deliver today?\" The rooms all ready, sure, bring it on! Plug it in, and nothing, I had to do NOTHING, it was the most perfect picture... OUT OF THE BOX! That I've ever seen. BETTER than my local retailers, better than I could imagine. This one has all the bells and whistles, I've already ordered from Samsung the wireless dingle. I've got the HD Tivo with the HD cable cards... this unit is amazing. So much so, we've ordered new furniture for this room, so more hours of comfortable viewing can be had.This will now be our escape and made possible by Amazon, their white glove service and SAMSUNG!

However, I did research by reading reviews on Amazon and AVSForum. Coming from a 4 year old Plasma, I have to say the colors and black levels are very impressive for an LCD (better than my previous plasma). I'm sure the current plasmas have better blacks, but the benefits of LCD far exceed the better blacks. The dynamic contrast ratio and black enhancer more than make up for any perceived differences in contrast ratio.I have to discuss AMP a little bit. At first, watching movies with AMP on seems \"off.\" The reason being that our eyes are familiar with 24 frame films which is actually not as natural as 60 or even 30 frames per second. However, we've watched movies at this rate all our lives so what's unnatural becomes natural. So when AMP adds frames to films, the movie seems more life like and a little strange or \"soap operaish.\" It's different, but it's by no means a bad thing. It's really a personal preference but I prefer the clarity and life-like HD quality of AMP. After a while, you'll get used to AMP and watching movies with it off will seem dull and boring, in my opinion.My TV does not have the \"halo\" phenomena that people reported. The glass edges seem frosted so perhaps it's been fixed? I love the glass and the touch of red, it really makes the TV look like a high end equipment. All in all, it's an awesome TV. Samsung has truly become the Sony of the 21st century.Update: I forgot to add that the speakers are terrific. I am comparing it to my old plasma and not to a sound system. Good bass and the dialogues are not muffled like my last TV. Dynamic mode with sports is amazing. The colors really pop and some people may dislike that because everything is exaggerated. Some people may prefer true realistic colors, but to me realistic just seems dull. I tried the calibrated settings on AVSForum but I didn't reallly like it. Trust your eyes.

Amazon shipped the TV on March 24th and estimated that it would be delivered by April 10th.  I was quite excited when I got a call to schedule the delivery on March 27th.  At that point the TV was ready for delivery, but since I live in a rural area, Pilot handed the TV off to Cardinal Freight.  Cardinal only delivers to my area on Fridays, so I had to wait a full extra week to get the TV.  It arrived on April 3rd, so it was still a week earlier then the estimated delivery date.  The delivery guys were in and out of the house, and pulling out of the driveway in probably less than 10 minutes.  \"White glove\"?  Not sure about that, but at least I got to plug the TV in before they were gone.As far as the TV goes, I'll just address various points one at a time:Firmware - I noticed that a lot of people gave reviews that included issues with repeated power cycling.  I made sure to double check my firmware version pretty soon after giving the TV a once over.  My TV shipped with version 1013.0 which is newer than the currently available version on the Samsung website, 1012.2.Gloss Screen - yeah, I would probably prefer a mat screen, but overall the picture quality of the TV outweighs any complaint I may have with screen reflections.  I have felt the need once or twice to turn off a light or two on the opposite side of the room while watching TV.  Not too big of a deal though. One nitpick... I can see the gray levels creep up a bit when viewing from an off angle of about 45 degrees or so.  The picture is still great, but the blacks aren't quite so black.  A mat screen would probably make this issue even a bit more pronounced, so pick your poison.Halo Effect - very, VERY minor.  I can see it, but it's certainly not a distraction.  I really need to consciously look for it.The Bezel - beautiful.  I really like this bezel.  It's one of the reasons I chose this TV over the 650.  So far I haven't seen any issues with the Touch of Color separating.  Fingers crossed!  We purchased a new entertainment center that has an opening that appears as if it were custom made for this bezel.  The edges of the bezel overlap the opening in our entertainment center hutch by about an eighth of an inch all the way around.  It looks great!Info Link - It was a snap to get the TV set up to my home network.  I set the network settings manually at first, and everything was fine.  I also tried the automatic settings and that works just fine as well.  We like the ability to check the weather at the click of a button.  News is nice, but we don't really use it much.  This functionality certainly wasn't a deal breaker in the TV selection, but it's pretty nice.DLNA - When I bought this TV I bought it along with a Playstation 3 to use as a Blu-Ray player.  The Playstation 3 can also be used in conjunction with various DLNA server programs that are freely available on the web.  For this reason, the DLNA functionality of the LN52A750 isn't really worth much to me.  Compared to the Playstation interface, the Samsung interface can't really compare.  I haven't even bothered to install the Samsung server software on my PC.  I'm using TVersity for serving music, photos, and video to the TV through the Playstation.  Supposedly some people have had luck getting TVersity to work with the 750, but I haven't been able to.  No matter... as I said, the Samsung interface is pretty poor anyway.  Since all photos, music, and video are getting transferred over the home network via the Playstation, I haven't tested the Wiselink, so I can't comment that.Extra Content - Pretty worthless.  It would be SO much nicer if the 1Gig of space could be modified to hold personal videos, pictures, etc.  I'll probably never use this functionality.Sound - Really quite good, and another reason I purchase this TV over the 650.  We watch a lot of TV without the surround sound system, so I wanted decent sound from the TV speakers.  Out of the box, I was pretty disappointed with the sound and thought I may have wasted my money, but after digging through the sound menu, I realized that there is quite a bit of flexibility.  Along with a few preset sound modes, there is also a custom setting in which you can adjust the 5 band equalize to suit your tastes.  You can also tweak any of the preset sound modes as well, if you don't like the defaults.  In case you change your mind, going back to the defaults is a click away.Standard Def TV -  We currently have a standard def Directv Tivo so we watch a LOT of SD content.  I'd love to change to a newer HD Directv DVR, but I don't want to give up the Tivo interface, and the Directv DVRs get a lot of poor reviews.  As such, I really searched for a new TV that would do a decent job with SDTV.  When shopping around, I read a lot of reviews, and almost hands down, the Samsung TVs get the best reviews for playing standard def format.  In short, my results were quite good!At first, I was a bit discouraged, but after tweaking a few settings, I've been very pleased. I had to turn OFF the 120Hz function, turn ON Film Mode (for 2:3 pull down), and turned Digital Noise Reduction up to High (fortunately, even on High, the DNR doesn't make things look that hazy). Then I changed the default color settings considerably. The defaults were great for HD sources like the blu-ray, but not for SDTV.  Fortunately, the TV has separate color settings for each input, so no fiddling with color settings each time the input is changedInterestingly enough, I think the 52\" Samsung has a better SD picture then my 22\" Visio. Also, my old 32\" Sony Trinitron (which the 750 replaced) always seemed to show a good bit of digital \"blockiness\" in the directv signal, especially in dark areas of the screen (probably from the video compression of the satellite signal). I don't see ANY of that anymore. There is a bit of small pixelization, but a certain amount of that is to be expected considering the source.  Don't get me wrong, it's certainly not HDTV or Blu-Ray quality, but overall, I'm quite pleased.One thing I wish the TV had was a Panoramic View for 4:3 TV.  It can only stretch the 4:3 image to fit the 16:9 screen.  My 22\" Visio had a Panoramic Mode that stretches the outsides of the screen more than the center of the screen.  That way the center (where your eye is typically concentrating) looks less distorted.  Oh well, the screen is so large that viewing SDTV in 4:3 is still plenty big.  I was just hoping to get rid of the vertical black bars.Blu-Ray - I can't comment on HDTV since I'm not currently an HD subscriber, but the Blu-Ray is FANTASTIC!  Obviously, this is where this TV really shines. There's not really much to say here that hasn't already been said.  Although one of the other reasons why I bought this TV over the 650 is the fact that this TV has 16bit color while the 650 only has 12bit color.  Wow! Is it great!  I did purchase a Digital Video Essentials blue ray disc with the TV.  It was a good help in getting the color set right.  I didn't have to change the \"out of the box\" settings by much, but I did change them enough to make a noticeable improvement (to me).One note... when using the Video Essentials disc, I noticed that there was a good bit of overscan on all of the patterns the disc was using.  I finally realized that by setting the viewing mode of the TV from 16:9 to \"Just Scan\", it displays the full image with zero overscan.  Pretty nice.Remote - I thought is was nicer then most people give it credit for.  The click wheel is a bit odd, but the rotating functionality can be avoided.  It also allows for simple up, down, left, and right clicking which is seems to work quite well.  The back light is a nice feature. At this point though the remote is just sitting in a drawer.  I've recently purchased a Logitec Harmony One remote to combine the TV, Tivo, Playstation, and Receiver.  Still learning how to use it, but so far it's great.The Perfect Compliment - I mentioned previously I purchased the LN52A750 along with a Playstation 3.  The added media functionality of the Playstation really makes the slight price increase over other decent Blu-Ray players very worthwhile.  The Playstation really opens this TV up to all sorts of other activities.  I've never in my life been a gamer, but they are quite fun on the 52\" screen, and the video quality is great.  I have yet to notice any lag, and I have yet to use the Game mode on the 750 which is supposed to reduce any lag.  Streaming video is great.  I've got a good portion of my DVD collection ripped to my home PC.  The Playstation allows for easy access.  TVersity can upconvert to 1080p, but I haven't tried that yet since I need to first hardwire the PC to the Playstation to accommodate the bandwidth.  Pictures are easy to share with visitors, and accessing my rather large mp3 collection has become easier than ever.  Supposedly a number of online radio web sites work on the Playstation, but I haven't tried any of them yet.If anyone is still reading at this point, I can easily say that this is one outstanding TV.  I got it for around 2050 bucks here on Amazon.  I know it can be had periodically for about 100 less, but I couldn't wait.  It was still, far and away, less than any local retailer, and it's been worth every penny so far.I'm giving the TV 4 out of 5 stars, because of the reflective screen, worthless extra content, missing panoramic view for 4:3 TV, poor DLNA interface, and slight issue with black levels at off angles.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Stellar performer", "Author": "Pricepal \"pricepal\"", "ReviewID": "R3JCDA81K9M9TG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Researched everything I could about this tv, then pulled the trigger!Fantastic picture right out of the box, if you want the very best picture though have it calibrated. there is nothing like this tv when it has been calibrated to your environment.As for the touch of red, I have heard good and bad about it. In my opinion it is barely noticeable and gives it a nice soft look on the edges.Many complain about screen glare, but none for me, even with my living room lights on there is no glare, but my lights are on the ends of my room, not in front of the tv.  If you watch any tv in super bright lighting, sunshine, huge bay windows etc, you are going to have glare.The halo issue: Do enough research on this tv and you will find many that dislike this set because it has a clear beveled end to the bezel that bleeds or casts a very thin line of the screen picture to it.  Many claim it is distracting and makes the tv unwatchable stating it casts a glow around the tv.  I have found this not to be the case. In complete darkness I cannot see it. In a lit room I cannot see it.I have to stand to the side of the tv to even see it, so I really don't know why its such a problem to some.The remote is backlit, and I have no complaints about the click wheel, I think its great.The sound is fine, not home theater quality but good enough for movies and tv.  If you do blu ray or  music a home theater system is in order.The rear jack panel is positioned properly at the right end of the back panel far enough right to eliminate any problems with mounting. It is located outside of the mounting area.  NOTE: The screws that are in the mounting holes are NOT for mounting the tv to the wall, they are too short, use the screw provided with your wall mount.As far as the 650 vs the 750, the biggest difference that I can find is the 750 has a slightly faster processor.My only complaint is trying to get the stand off in order to wall mount the tv. Two hours trying to get 4 tiny screws out of the 750's mounting platform.  They are recessed 2 inches deep, and are in so tight it is very tough to get them out without rounding the heads off!So all in all, its a great tv, hands down the BEST tv at this price point, money well spent and should satisfy all but the highly critical videophile.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture quality", "Author": "S.

I have the luxury of having an 52XBR4 next to it (being returned - too wide), and with the settings at their ideal levels on both sets, the Samsung is CONSIDERABLY better. I find the detail / colors / sharpness / blacks to be far superior. I also noticed a few people commenting about the red accent around the perimeter. At night, it's not at all noticable. During the day, it's nothing more than a subtle hue and not at all distracting...as a matter of fact it adds class to a black slab sitting in a room.

The TV showed up 1 week earlier than estimated.  The CEVA driver brought it in, checked for damage, set it up, turned it on and only then did I sign for it.

Stevens", "ReviewID": "R3OI9KM1AQ2F5V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first HDTV purchase and I have to say I am very pleased with this set to-date. I am a long time Sony fan and up till this purchase all the other TV's I've Purchased has been Sony's. If Sony had come out with a  \"Z\" series in a 52\" that was similarly priced, they may have had me.  But when purchasing on what I saw (picture) and not my heart I feel I made the right decision.  Here are some quick points on my thoughts about the 52A750.1)The picture is outstanding right out of the box. This alone should drive most purchases.2)The complaints about glare from the glossy screen are way over rated.3)The bezel design looks real nice, however it could of been a little bit smoother, as I notice some slight imperfections in the reflections off of it. Being that it has that nice glossy black finish any imperfection tends to be magnified in the reflection.4)The small red color at the edge looks nice up close, but can't really be seen past 5 or 6 feet.5)4 HDMI inputs make for quick set up.6)The VGA computer input works great.7)The Remote is well designed for the TV, and the Samsung DVD player I also purchased, but not great for much else. I'd probably recommend a nice Logitech programmable remote if you have more things to control. The back lit keys are nice when it is dark in the room. The response time on the remote seems a bit slow. I think other reviews have mentioned this also. Not bad, just noticeable.8)The cable hookups on the back are not recessed very much, so mounting it close to the wall presents a little bit of a problem where the cables stick out. I have mine mounted 1 inch off the wall so I had to place a recessed box in the wall right behind where the cables came out of the TV. This works, but made positioning of the box in the wall critical so that it would line up with that spot on the TV. I wish they would mount those connections so the cables hang down parallel with the set instead of perpendicular.9)The connections on the side are hidden well, but still easy to get to when hooking up the Video Camera, or making any temporary video connection.10)I have the set wall mounted and have not noticed the halo or edge reflection that some have complained about. I really like the way the clear edge looks.11) Delivery was quick, but I took the advice of others and made sure I called the Local shipping company to schedule a delivery as soon as I saw it had arrived (two days after ordered) in the local warehouse. Only one person came out to deliver it, so I had to help them get it unpacked and set up, but I wanted to do that anyway. They really did not know how to test it, but they hung around for 30 min while I ran it though a few test, including syncing to all the cable stations (took awhile). I also hooked up my laptop and ran a pixel test to insure all were good for primary color. Needless to say all tests were good. They offered to take the packing, but I'll keep it just in case.12) Amazon, has refunded be twice, now as the price dropped $100 since I purchased the set. I see though it looks like they are going to stop their \"Post-Order Price Guarantee\" as of Sept 1, so that's something I'll have to consider on future purchases.So anyway as I said before, I'm very happy with my purchase and just hope I don't experience any problems with the set for years to come. The year warranty is pretty lame, I see the new \"8\" series now has an 18 month warranty.I hope this helps with your purchase decision.------------------------------------------------------------------------Ok.. I've had the set now over 30 days and I am still impressed with the picture quality and how good the set looks. But a problem that others have seen has now appeared on mine. It's a small spot about 3/4 of an inch along the left side that looks like the Touch of Red coloring has corroded away. I had read some post earlyer abount \"Red Fade\" and checked the TV and it was not there. The set is wall mounted so it hasn't moved since, but all of the sudden it it there!The real problem I have with it is that is really shows up. I've never seen the halo problem that other people talk about, but this little spot now stands out as it is reflecting the light a little different than the rest. I kind of looks like the red coloring has kind of crept away leaving a bit of a corroded look where the smooth red edge was. You can't feel it as the front and back of the frame are still smooth, so it happening internally in the lamination.I ordered this set from Amazon, and now am wondering which steps to take to get this fixed since some have said the Samsung claims this as COSMETIC and therefore not covered by the warranty.

Irecently have redone my basement and have been looking for a 46\"/52\" lcd tv for a while now. I just purchased and received the LN52A750 and ohhhmy lord, it is just amazing what this thing can do.. Especially when compared to such a top notch competitor like the XBR albeit that one is 60hz and the other at 120hz it is still truly amazing what kind of video experience the Samsung can create. You feel like you are going to fall in to the picture it is so clear especially with a well controlled/ dimmed theater lighting system. It is connected to the Sony STRDG820 7.1 Audio Video Receiver and the Harmon Kardon HKTS-18 5.1 Channel Speaker System from the HD Cable dvr... The Samsung 1500 or Sony PS3 blue-ray dvd player will probably be forth coming when they get off their high horses and drop their prices to more realistic numbers. I do consider myself a long time videophile and I am really glad I got the Samsung.** The White glove delivery service was extremely quick (4 days from order click) not to mention was curtious, on-time, and with a smile.. My wife called me at work to say how impressed she was with the delivery.** The Halo effect when in a viewed in a very dark room is noticeable but does not bother me at all. IMHO considering the quality of the video why would you look any where else other than the middle of that beauty of a screen.** We both love the TOC, it is really not noticeable at all.** Unit does get warm pretty quick which makes me glad I got the articulating wall mount to pull it out from the entertainment center.** The remote with it's controls is not my favorite and the circular spinning dial thing really does not work consistently enough for me to do anything other than be annoying.** I can agree that there is a little bit of a lag time when going thru menu controls that gets a little annoying when you are used to immediate response time but considering how often I go thru menus it really is not a big deal. However, those are the only two things that I really care to complain about!!

Actually, the delivery service missed the afternoon delivery time window because they got delayed in traffic, but they came back at 8:00 in the evening to deliver it, which I really appreciated.The only negative, and it isn't really a negative, is that the screen and bezel are highly reflective, much more so than the Sony for example, so reflections can be a problem if you have windows or lights behind the viewer. However, I bought a tilting wall mount, and I find that just alittle downward tilt can eliminate virtually all the reflections. The positive side of the reflective screen is that it is incredibly sharp, noticeably sharper than Sony's Bravia, which has a matte screen. I'll happily deal with tilting the unit once in a while to have the amazing picture quality.For what it's worth, I highly recommend the Sanus tilting wall mount.

Would not compare with actual decent speakers,being housed in a TV cabinet and all, but when I stream music to it,is quite acceptable for our needs.Extras and Other Comments:I upgraded the TV firmware from the Samsung website using a USB drive.The remote control response became snappier - not sure what else it fixed.The touch of red tint around the edges looks nice - matches walls within our case. Makes the TV look even more modern, but that is a matter of taste.TV came with a bunch of pre-built media - pictures (Monet and van Gough paintings),recipes, some low-powered games like bowling etc. There is a Content buttonon remote to get to these.The remote is nice. Feels a little big. Does not seem to have a sleep button,you can get to that via menu. TV has Three programmable on and off timersthat can be set up by day.WiseLinkPro is something else. HD streaming over the home network without external devices!But standard TV streaming for some reason is a little jerky - like the speed changes.That is bothersome, as when I stream the same videos to my PS3 it is silky smooth.HD streaming is silky smooth, however.

This was cheaper than the lower 650 series Samsung and it comes with extra content and, in my opinion is more astheticly pleasing with a wider glass bezel rather than the \"rounded\" plastic corners of the 650.  It also has VERY subtle DARK red around the outside that is barely noticeable.  CNET and others complained of the red, but I can barely see it, even when looking for it.Others also complained of the extended bezel corners caused an annoying reflection/glare by reflecting the light from the screen in the corners and causing some distraction, I have also looked for this and did so on the store model as well and have not noticed ANY distracting light or reflections.  I have heard that there are different screens and coatings that may have been used that could contribute to this affect.  My TV says SQ01 as a version number which may tell those concerned some info about my specific model.The complaints about the extra content are valid as it truly does feel \"tacked on\", however it is a nice feature that can be used to add ambient background during parties and to show off your TV at the same time, as the pictures that come with it are stunningly gorgeous.  The fact that I got this TV cheaper than the 650 Series that did not come with this content (i.e. cooking recipes, wallpaper type pics, children's games, etc.) is really the only reason I can justify getting it.I have also found the complaints about the remote \"wheel\" (like a cheap version of the iPod navigation wheel) to be true for the most part, as it IS NOT very responsive...BUT I very rarely notice b/c you can just click the bottom, top and left/right portions to have it act as arrows would, which IS VERY responsive.  I find myself not even utilizing or missing the wheel feature.I have set each input for the various accessories I have, being Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3.  The PS3 input is set for dark room Blu-ray viewing per CNET's recommended settings.  It IS BEAUTIFUL!  I recently viewed my friend's 50\" Sony DLP, watching Casino Royal \"on below DVD downloaded quality granted\" but noticed that the blacks were DARKER on HIS, but with the overall better picture quality and brighter picture I am still EXTREMELY pleased with this TV!  Very little color adjustment is needed out of the box, I just left mine alone and set it on WARM 2!  The \"Game\" mode for the 360 and PS3 when playing games is great!.  The \"Sports\" mode is very accessible through the E.Mode button via the remote allowing a quick change from the dark room film settings for my cable box!  I would only recommend (as many others have said) the 120Hz being turned on for SPORTS ONLY, unless you want to see cheap background sets and props in Blu-rays and DVDs!  I noticed many of these in Pirates of the Caribbean, The Strangers, and The Dark Knight when playing with the 120Hz settings.After some more research I have discovered that it is the AutoMotion Plus that you want turned off except for sports.  The TV will always run at 120Hz which is great, it will just repeat some frames to match the framerate of the movie or show.  Thus, the AutoMotion Plus is great for sports where there is fast motion.  However, some people seem to like the AutoMotion on even for movies as it does tend to make a somewhat \"3-D\" effect.

You have to play around with the settings a bit, I found that turning on Dynamic Contrast made a normal picture more contrasty but really killed the blacks (made them light grey) on a black screen so I turned it off. During the day none of this is noticeable but at night with the lights off the lack of the LCD's ability to actually go black is very noticeable and can be annoying if the settings aren't right.The color and clarity of this are amazing. Watching \"Mickey's once upon a christmas\" blew me away, it was hard to believe it was only a standard definition DVD and the colors were out of this world lush. It is a bit critical of poor quality video from say, DirecTV for example but DVD/PS3 look wonderful on it and Blu-Ray even more so (although I have to admit there's not much difference between a really good DVD and most Blu-Ray movies that I've watched). Overall the set does a very good job of upscaling and handling lower resolution inputs.I had some problems getting HDMI1 to lock onto my receiver so I just use HDMI2 and that locks on with no problems. The front panel controls are seriously hard to find and disappear completely when idle. You have to look in bright light very closely at the front right edge to see the faint white icons and then touch in the right spot to get them to light up. Cool, and great for keeping little children from touching the controls but had me wondering where they were for a while.The built in stuff is a bit of a yawn. They show these beautiful lush pictures on the main contents menu, then drop into some dark low contrast mode to play the games - not sure why but not a good advertisement for their picture quality. The food stuff looks nice and the get fit material (which rightly follows the desserts section) is some sort of flash animation that I would rate useful for a quick giggle only but not overly useful.I loaded up some pictures from my Shutterstock collection (via a PS3) and the image quality was just amazing. The pictures looked nearly as good as my desktop monitor (which cost more than the 52A750) and going through the collection on a 52\" screen was quite a treat.On fast moving video response time was a non-issue with no noticeable lag or blurring. 120Hz motion flow works well with no apparent down side, and I definitely notice the stuttering if I turn it off. The built in sound is really very good, not as good as my multi-thousand dollar home theater system but for a television it's among the best I've heard. For the most part I don't use it though, since the receiver is always on when the television is on.Overall top marks for an excellent television.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN52A750", "Author": "Blades", "ReviewID": "R30K3JII62A1J4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this 750 about 4 weeks ago no tax and free shipping $2,318 :-) great deal being that my local stores were selling this at the time $3299 and so far I've seen it on sale once for $2999 \"special order from best buy\".

In the LN52A750 Samsung has given the world brilliant picture quality and stunning style in a unit that anyone would be proud to make the centerpiece of their living room or entertainment palace.Right out of the box the picture is impressive, although the factory settings are too bright and overly saturated. This is to be expected, however, as virtually all manufacturers tune their sets to stand out in store displays. After fine-tuning my set using Digital Video Essentials: Optimize Your Home Entertainment System (NTSC Component), I now have a virtually perfect picture. It was a tedious and time-consuming process, however, so my recommendation to the patience-impaired would be to hire someone locally to do the work using the latest test equipment. For most people it would be well worth the cost (est. $50 -$75) after shelling out a couple of G's for a state-of-the-art LCD television.Before purchasing this set, I was somewhat concerned about the red cast of the \"Touch of Color\" bezel. I shouldn't have been. It's really quite subtle, almost unnoticeable, but gives just a hint of color interest to what otherwise would be a black monolith when the unit is powered off. And when it's turned on, well, let's just say that no one will be looking at the edges of the set!I must give credit also to the tuner in this baby. While I generally watch HDTV (clear QAM) fed by my cable provider, I also get 26 strong, clean digital over-the-air channels (NTSC) using a medium-range boom antenna that I stashed out of sight in my attic back in the days of analog television. The transmitters for some of those stations are over 50 miles away, and my antenna is stationary (no rotor)!My only real gripe about the normal television functionality is that the set has only one F connector (antenna) input. In order to have access to both cable QAM and over-the-air NTSC signals, I had to install an A/B switch (remote-controlled, which I bought from a popular neighborhood radio store) and then to skip the automatic channel scan in favor of tuning the cable and OTA stations separately).If I were rating this set on the normal television features alone, I'd give it five starts (or more, if it were possible). However, there are a few flaws in this set. It is advertised as being DLNA-ready, and it is - sort of. The bad news is that it is currently compatible ONLY with the Samsung DLNA server software packaged with the set, which has rudimentary functionality at best. And it works over wired Ethernet only; forget about any kind of wireless setup. The RSS InfoLink does work over wireless, but the content is marginally useful. Meanwhile, the interactive content that is preloaded into the on-bard memory isn't anything to write home about, and the promise of being able to acquire more on line is yet to be fulfilled.Despite those few disappointments, some of which I hope will be resolved someday, I am still in love with this set after three months. In my opinion, the picture quality exceeds that of some more expensive, higher end sets, and I can honestly recommend the entire series 7 line from Samsung to just about anyone looking for a great-looking, top-performing LCD.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, Horrible Network Features (DLNA FAILURE)", "Author": "JT", "ReviewID": "R2UHQPYLM17PG1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this model instead of the 650 model because of the network features and the built in sub woofer.At first, I was impressed, everything looks nice.

We did all the normal things that a person would do, and we checked out all of the well-known sources for new TV's.  After all of our research, we finally came to the inevitable conclusion that our new TV was going to be an LCD this time around, and that it would probably be in the 52\" range, based on our current living room dimensions and environment.  We also eventually narrowed the extensive list of manufacturers down to just 2 (Sony and Samsung).  Since we had previously owned a 67\" Samsung DLP TV and we had experienced absolutely no problems at all with our other Samsung DLP TV in the 3 years that we owned it, we finally decided that we would purchase another Samsung product.  The only decision left was to decide which 52\" LCD model would we select from Samsung.We closely compared the various Samsung models, side-by-side, at Best Buy and also at Costco.  Our choices were the LN52A550, LN52A650 and the LN52A750.  We did spend some time thinking about the new 8 Series LN52A850, but just felt that in our case, the extra bucks weren't quite worth it, especially when we compared the 750 and 850 models right next to each other at Best Buy. So, our final decision was the Samsung LN52A750.And what a great decision that was.Price-wise, there is no way that anyone can come close to Amazon's price, especially when you take into consideration the initial purchase price, and the fact that the shipping costs were FREE, and that there was no sales tax added on either.  On October 14th, I went online to Amazon's website and placed our order for our new 52\" Samsung LCD TV.  We live in the Palm Springs, California area and it arrived here yesterday, October 20th, via CEVA's white glove treatment.  We couldn't have been more pleased with their setup procedure and their professionalism.Within just a few minutes after reading the Quick Setup Guide, we had the new TV up and running along side our also new Samsung Blu-Ray HD-DVD player.  Since we didn't own any Blu-Ray DVD's at the time, the first movie I grabbed without even looking was \"The Thomas Crown Affair\".  After the initial credits played, the movie began.  OMG!!  Yeah, those were the exact first words out of my mouth . . . .  Oh My God!!  I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.I am even blind in my right eye, but right off the bat, the most impressive thing I noticed, besides the incredible clear and perfect picture, was the difference watching a TV with the 120Hz Auto Motion Plus option.  At first I thought I was watching a \"live\" broadcast of something.  There are honestly NO words that could ever adequately describe the difference in watching a TV with this option.  It's truly100% awesome.  You just have to see it for yourself, to truly understand what I'm talking about.We've now had only 24 hours to watch our new Samsung HD-TV but we couldn't be happier.  We know we made a perfect choice.  It feels so good knowing that we made the right choice, especially with everything else that goes on in the world today.  However, we truly though MUST take a minute to properly THANK everyone else that wrote a review on Amazon about this particular TV.  It helped us tremendously in so many ways as we shopped for our new TV.You can't possibly go wrong with Amazon's low prices.  You can't go wrong with Samsung's products.  And you certainly can't go wrong in choosing this particular model of  HD-TV from Samsung.  I just hope that we can help someone else out there to make the same decision that we were facing just a few days ago.  And I'll go on record to say that I would guarantee you that you will enjoy this TV, just as much as we do, even after only 24 hours of use.THANKS again so very, very much, especially to everyone at Amazon, Samsung, CEVA and also to all those critics who wrote a previous review of this product.

If it doesn't, I am going to have to return this TV (LN52A750) for another or the earlier model.It would be sad though because aside from the poor red text in PC gaming, that is the only thing \"wrong\" with the TV.I did notice the \"Halo\" effect but only because I was looking for it. Even after reading articles, I was still a slight bit unsure what I was actually looking for. Personally, I am a very picky person and I have not been bothered once by this issue. I guess if you have it on a wall mount and tucked close to the wall, it may be more noticeable but in my situation I have zero problem with it.The only other gripe I have is actually not with the TV and therefore not something I can knock its star rating for. That other thing is with Amazon shipping. Sure, a lot of people have had many good experiences with Amazon using Pilot but in my situation it was awful.Amazon gave the package to Pilot and Pilot gave the package to a local moving company here in my town. That local company got the package on a Thursday and didnt even call me to schedule an appointment for almost two weeks. What's worse is I thought there was some kind of fraud because the local moving company reported back to Pilot that it was delivered, when it wasn't. The local company finally gave me a call and when they showed up there was only one guy. I had to help him in with the TV and then he refused to let me see if it was in working condition. When I refused to sign the documentation he agreed to open the box. I told him he was supposed to take the TV to the room of my choosing, unpack it and let me set it up to see if its working... but because he had already been rude I just told him to get out (this was after I took the top of the box off and plugged it in to at least see if it would turn on).After he left I called Amazon, they didn't care and told me the shipping was free anyways but it's Pilot's fault who they choose to give the package to. I will never buy a large item like this through Amazon again, no matter the discount.To make matters even worse, they no longer offered a post order price guarantee. I have been a long time customer with Amazon and when I purchased this item, I thought they still offered their post order price match deal. Sadly, they no longer offer this deal and they figured that taking the information off their help site was sufficient enough to let customers know that it isn't offered anymore. I simply argued that they should AT THE VERY LEAST post that as of Sept. 1 2008 they are no longer offering a post order price match guarantee. To simply remove information regarding it isn't sufficient notification.If I have to return the TV because of the red text, I will just get a refund as long as one is offered.

This TV is off the hook.  Outrageous...We have DirecTV in SD transmission because much of what we watch is still in SD transmission.  The SD programs from Russian Channel 1 are a bit grainy when examined from 3 inches in front of the screen.  From the other side of the room, i.e. 15 feet, the image is fabulous.  Other SD transmissions from here in the States have the same effect.  It's the SD transmission quality, not the TV.DVD's are outrageous even in standard DVD quality.  For about $80 you can find a major-brand up-grade converter to transform standard DVD's into near-HD quality.  Be sure to use a quality HDMI cable available for <$10 on-line.Now, when you go to TV broadcasts in HD, eg. the local news, Fox Sports, Robin Meade on CNN, then you see what looks like a 3-D image that blows you away.  We watched National Geographic's \"Inside the Vietnam War\", MLB, Nascar, various music performances, and were very impressed.  They ran a \"Burn Notice Marathon\" on USA Network--it's like looking through a window.There is a reflection issue around the screen, but all you have to do is dim your lights at night.  It's so cool to watch the TV in the dark, like at the movies.  The easy way to kill the reflections is not to put black tape on the set.  RECOMMENDATION:  just set the unit further back in your furniture enclosure and the reflections will disappear since the ambiant light will no longer reach the screen from the sides.The TV looks so stylish, similar in style to my wife's Toshiba laptop.  It completely fills the open space in our huge furniture home entertainment center.  A killer TV.BTW, our big room measures 16' by 32' and the kitchen looks out into the room.  Now I can wash the dishes and enjoy the show.  The sofa is at about 15' from the screen and is just perfect.As for the speakers:  many people complain that they don't like the sound, whine, whine, whine.  1)  I did a custom settings myself (for free) and the sound is excellent!  20W speakers sound fantastic, no need to turn it above 25 on the scale 0-100.  2) For a bigger-than-life experience, I connected it to our \"old\" Sony 200W home entertainment system which has several pre-set sound mixes (large/small concert hall, automatic, 5.1 surround sound, game, jazz, \"house music\", etc.) which does the job with ease.  Rock on Wayne, with AC/DC's tour videos.Forget the reflections, watch the show.Also, I did a custom settings myself and the picture is a quantum-leap better viewing than with the standard settings.  You can always revert back to the out-of-the-box settings.

I have been a TV snob for some time and would have gladly put my money down on a Sony if they had a model that would stream video from a DLNA compatible device.  At the time I purchased, the Samsung LN52A750 was one of the few TVs that had this capability.  I bought it, pretty much just hoping it would work.I put some MPEG video clips from my Sony HDR-CX7 camcorder (which records directly to a memory stick) on a flash drive and headed to the local big name retailer.  It played the movies with ease and drew a bit of a crowd in the process since those in the know thought it was pretty cool the TV could play videos of my kids from a flash drive.  I decided to roll the dice and hope that the it would work equally well over Ethernet.  I figured if it didn't, I could always break out a flash drive and do it via sneakernet.When the unit arrived, I connected to my wired network which has a Thecus N2100 NAS attached.  The NAS has a DLNA server module running that I downloaded for free from Thecus.  I really thought this was a bit of a long shot but wanted to try it before I installed Samsung's DLNA server software on my PC.  To my surprise, the TV found the NAS and offered up the video I had shared using the DLNA server running on it.  It was shockingly painless.  I have no intention of installing the DLNA software that comes with the TV so I cannot comment on that.I found that my setup worked equally well when displaying digital photos.  One problem I noticed is that the first icon offered will display all photos found.  If you have a large number it will take a very long time to respond.  I ended up unplugging the TV and starting over since it was unresponsive when I tried with about 1100 photos.  I reorganized the photos into folders shared by my DLNA server and all is well.Although the TV is capable of playing MP3 music files shared by the DLNA server, I haven't tried it.  I can't imagine why anyone would want to.I'm not going to comment on the other features of the TV.  There are plenty of reviews that already have.

The minute the Earth appeared I started laughing. After watching a 25-year-old TV this was quite the shock to the system. We also have AT&T; U-Verse. The HD programming is stunning. In fact, I find myself watching shows HD shows I don't even like because it's so hypnotizing. All devices are connected via HDMI. My favorite part of the TV (besides the picture) is that it comes with an optical audio out. This means that I have one optical audio cable that runs from the TV to the stereo receiver. This has simplified things for me trying to explain to my wife which remote runs which item and how to get the stereo sound on. Basically, the TV is an audio switch. Everything goes in, one cord comes out. Simple.Previous reviewers complained about the glare on the TV or the frame. We have it in a well-lit room next to a sliding glass door. I have yet to be bothered by any glare. The TV is just too bright for glare to show. As to the glare on the frame, give me a break. The blinking \"12:00\" on the old VCR is more distracting than any glare on the frame.The 750 is simply stunning. The picture quality is great, and the screen is huge.

I mostly watch movies so I am not going to elaborate on HDTV quality, which is great. I do not have a BlueRay but only a standard $40 Philips DVD player for now (with an HDMI connection), and the picture quality is nonetheless impressive, so crisp with most of the movies that it took me a little while to get use to it, sometimes I had the feeling that the picture was almost looking unreal, because the characters were so sharp.Halo: I was a bit concerned by the reviews mentioning the halo while  watching in dark rooms, so far I have not noticed it but I never watch in a completely dark room, there is always a dim light somewhere. This is not an issue for me.Glare: That's true that the display is very reflective but it is also so bright that this compensate for the reflection. As I said before I mostly watch the TV at night (with the screen set to \"low brightness\"), but during the day, with setup to \"high\", it is fine. Still if you focus on a reflection spot it will probably be visible, but this has not been an issue either for me so far.Computer monitor:- I tried the analog, VGA port, and the picture quality was kind of yellowish, and I have not investigated further, this was just a test.- When using the HDMI connection (HDMI 2 port), the picture quality is perfect. I have not done extensive gaming testing, but my RC flight simulator was impressive on that big display.USB:- I used a USB storage to load pictures, the quality is good of course but I do not really like the interface and the pictures are very slow to get indexed by the TV software. What I mean is that if for exple I have 500 pictures on the USB key, it is going to take \"a while\" (a long while) before I am able to visualize all of them. When indexed, the loading time is OK.- Video (.avi): I tried to play several videos (shot with a Canon Powershot) from the USB storage, the video plays well but after about 10s, the audio stops! On all of them. They are fine on a computer of course. I have not been able to figure out what is wrong yet.Networking: Not tested, I still have to get some \"powerline network\" card to connect the TV to my network, I do not like the idea a Samsung's proprietary wireless card, which cannot be used with some of the features.Conclusion:I love this TV, I just hope it is going to be a reliable purchase, not like this piece of junk of Toshiba DLP, only time will tell.

I liked the idea of the 750's straight-edged rectangle better anyway.What sold me on the Samsung was a display at one of the big box electronics stores. They had a blu-ray hooked up to it and it was playing Open Season. My jaw dropped and the drool began to run. I had never seen such detail and an almost 3D look in a tv before. Putting it up on the wall with my newly purchased blu-ray player showed just as fabulous of a picture. The quality of the picture is definitely related to the source and blu-ray is a sweet source, but this tv also handles Dish HD and over the air HD beautifully.As for some of the other problems people have hashed around:Touch of Color- is subtle and I don't notice it. My room is fairly dark with a deep red paint. I'm sure you'd see it with white walls and a fair amount of light. I haven't had any cracking of the color yet as some have pointed out.The \"Halo Effect\"- Is there. I noticed it right away and tuned it out. It's not a big deal, so much that I haven't remembered seeing it since that first day.I cannot comment on the sound as I always have the sound running through my receiver.

I rarely use it.-Sound - woofer (not sub-woofer)is only marginally better than other tvs.  I have this tv paired with a soundbar anyway, so it don't use the tv's speakers.-AutoMotionPlus- I keep it at low or off, because it make the picture looks so clear that it's kinda un-natural.Cons:-PIP is useless (I could only get it to work with one of the sources being a PC)-Remote is crap, the wannabe ipod style clickwheel is very unresponsive.Overall I am very pleased with this set.  I have been waiting to upgrade my Panasonic RPLCD for 3 yrs now and actually was set on picking up the 650 when I amazingly found the 750 onsale for $100 cheaper (Thanks Frys!).OTA HD signals produce an amazing picture.  Bluray off my PS3 is ridiculous.  The tv even does a decent job of upscaling standard def as well.  For those who like tweaking their picture, the tv has all types of settings to mess with.  I'm sure if you want to fork out the $$ for professional calibrating, the picture would be even more incredible.I was a little weary of the screen being the glossy type like those on plasmas since the room that it's in has a bit of natural light coming in, but it wasn't as bad as I thought.  Apparently Samsung went away from the matted screens because the glossy ones help produce darker blacks.  And this tv definitely produces some of the deepest blacks I've seen on a LCD and rival all plasmas (except maybe the Kuro sets, but holds its own).Bottom line, you will be very pleased with this tv.

Bayer \"KBayer\"", "ReviewID": "R2X1YQE1CSO3SX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have you spent hours, days, or even weeks trying to make the best decision possible? Of course, but please, take the pressure off of yourself and KNOW that most of these tv's will provide an utterly astonishing picture, so it doesn't really matter which one you choose -- unless there are known issues, you will be happy!  I had a chance to see many of these tv's lined up, side-by-side, various brands, all playing the same Blu-Ray, all hooked up via HDMI. The sales rep showed me how he could make a \"lesser\" TV dominate the others by merely adjusting the \"STD\" and \"DYNAMIC\" settings and multiple other settings -- and vice-versa. There are a wide range of adjustments to toy with, for sure!  Regarding LCD's, 120hz (even 240hz), 52-55\" screens, -- if someone was to hide the frame from view -- so that you could see only the screen, it would be almost impossible to distinguish whether you are looking at a Sony, Samsung, Toshiba, etc. There's just no significant difference.  However, there is a subtle difference with the newer LED screens that are out now, but it's only noticeable when you are close-up, about 12\" away from the screen (it's almost impossible to see pixels -- really beautiful!) But back away about 5 feet from any of them, and again, they all look the same. (Again, just my opinion)...  At this point, in this price range with these manufacturers, it all boils down to features, appearance and design of the frame (bezel) and price. Some have internet links, some have usb or memory card ports, some have swivel stands, black bezels, red bezels, glossy, matte, etc. Pick what matters to you.  After hours of going back and forth, I finally settled on the LN52A750. It was being displayed right next to the LN52B750 and another Samsung with a 46\" LED screen. From about 5 feet away, the A750 was just as beautiful as the LED set -- and $800 cheaper.HDMI vs Component...  Once home, I set the TV up and since this was my first HDMI experience, out of curiosity, I set up the TV with component first, then with HDMI. The video/audio diference was noticeable, but not much. If for example, the HDMI give you 100% quality, I'd say thet component gives you 95% quality, and it's noticeable only if you really analyze it by playing a particular scene over and over, toggling back and forth.  Also, I couldn't seem to capture the \"feel\" of the \"MotionFlow\" that I experienced at the store unti I realized that my Blu-Ray was set at 720x480 for some reason. I set it to 1980x1080p and BAM... huge difference. (And yes, the Blu-Rays do make a HUGE difference in quality over standard dvd's when you are viewing with these sets!)  The little things really add up to make a nice difference.  Final note -- all HD channels are not the same. Some are \"crap\", some are breathtakingly gorgeous. So don't blame the TV or get buyer's remorse if you happen upon a crap channel. The TV does the best it can with the channel it's displaying. HGTV-HD, for example is hit-n-miss. Some shows are filmed with high tech equipment and display beautifully. Some are horrible.  And watching standard definition channels... well, let's just say that the Blu-ray and HD channels will spoil you rotten (but in a fun way)!  Back to this particular model -- I've looked for and can't find the \"halo effect\" that some complain about, so it's likely been redesigned since it's launch. I also have no problem with the \"dial\" on the remote. I actually like it -- and I also like that you can set it to where it lites up on it's own if you touch it in the dark -- cool feature\". (There's a very quiet rattle in the remote that you can hear which is a motion detecting device). The settings are very intuitive, and the manual is layed out beautifully.  I can't imagine how the manufactures can improve on the picture quality, but whatever they do, I'm sure that any revolutionary changes will be a few years down the road, and crazy expensive in the beginning --so for now -- and at least for the next few years, I'm thrilled with this purchase.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beware of this TV and Samsung Support", "Author": "S.

It appears as though the actors are standing in my living room. I can't see the halo that so many reviewers complained about and so far the touch of color is intact.  The only problem I have with this is the lag. The response on this tv is only 4 milliseconds. From everything I have read, that is much faster than most, if not all lcd's. I have read that there is also a lag from the source. I'm not really sure which is the main offender. There is a \"game\" setting and it is very helpful, but it's not quite enough. I play a lot of retro games, Atari 2600 & Nintendo NES, etc. Most of these require high speed moves. I've tried most of my games on the tv and most of them are fine, but others are just not going to make it. I could not survive the first 90 seconds of Mike Tyson on Punch Out. And my score on Kaboom! was sub par. But my god the NES games look amazing. The Atari looks a little hazy, but it's 33 years old so I can forgive this.  I don't have A PS3 yet but Wikipedia says that the lag won't exist with HDMI connection. PS2 looks good and I'm sure the lag is there, but I don't feel it with any of my games.  The lag is also present with my Directv DVR. Fast forward commercials and you miss out on the bounce back when you hit play. So I have too rewind for a few seconds everytime, which quickly gets annoying. I'm not using HDMI as I'm still recieving standard definition.(waiting for the next HD DirectTivo). I'm hoping that will increase the speed and take care of that problem.  The sound quality is nothing special, but no tv sound ever is. The remote is fine, although too complicated for my universal to keep up. So now I have extra clutter on the coffee table. The stand is suitable with grips on the bottom. It looks great, doesn't weigh too much, and the inputs are adequate.  I suppose it is the closest thing to perfection that exists today.

These choices are pretty subjective in the end it is all very personal. I wanted another Sony but had to reconsider when we visited our local Best Buy and had to admit that my wife had a point: the Samsung had a more dynamic color range and that appealed to me. From the Consumer Reports review of the Samsung, \" stands out as one of the best LCDs we've tested\". We agree.While we tend to run our movies through the Yamaha amp. the regular speakers in the 750 are certainly better than most normal wide screens: we chose between the 750 and 650 based on the woofer in the 750s sound system.Back on the delivery-the Amazon white glove delivery service is as advertised: quick 10-14 days from purchase and delivered to the living room 'plug and play' and ready to go.In retrospect: the time \"dialing this puppy in\" is pretty much spent synchronizing the TV with cable controller and the cable box.

Geek Squad warranty = $[...].  I asked the salesman if they matched Amazon.  He didn't know.  He asked another guy and the final answer was, \"Well, we'll come down some and get closer to Amazon but we won't match it.\"  That was strange for a store that claims to match any advertised price.  I asked how they expected to sell the 2007 model when it was $[...] too high.  Salesman: \"Well...we put our price out there and see what happens, then we have room to work with you so that everybody is happy and you get the TV you want.\"  What?  Everybody is happy?  I wouldn't be happy unless they matched Amazon!  Me: \"Well, I gave your store a chance first because you are local in my city, but since you aren't even close to competitive, when my income tax refund comes in two days, I'm buying from Amazon.\"Happily for me, the price at Amazon dropped yet another $[...] before the money was available to buy.

A little bit of problems getting my DirecTV dish to work at first with the aux inputs because of the way the AUX 2 inputs are said to work but they don't seem to work that way, but the HDMI cables work instantly.  I like the way if you turn on a Blu-Ray player, the TV comes on automatically and goes to the correct input.I had no HD programming to put in the TV so for the first two days, I was on the verge of disappointed by watching normal programming and DVDs smeared out over 52 inches.  I knew the Samsung could do much better so I got frustrated and ran out and bought a highly-rated Sony Blu-Ray player that upverts DVDs and can be set to output only 1080p to the TV.  Right away my satisfaction skyrocketed even before getting any Blu-Ray disks.I don't want to replce my DVD selection with Blu-Ray disks and there hasn't been much out lately that I liked enough to spend Blu-Ray prices on so I pulled out King Kong, all the Terminators, and some other action movies I own and was amazed at what an improvement the upverting was for the old DVDs.  I've got Transporter 3 coming to me tomorrow on Blu-Ray and I've read everywhere that there's no comparison to any previous technology, so I'm eagerly awaiting the disk's arrival so I can become properly addicted to 1080p.  I'm also having my DirecTV upgraded to 1080p next week with their DVR receiver that connects with HDMI.I've watched the internal programming of photographs, recipes, etc. that Samsung includes in the TV and that shows what the 1080p truly looks like.  Picture quality, crisp detail right down to pores in the actor's skin or a stray hair laying on a shoulder during a cameo shot closeup, greatly improved movement blur because of the anti-blurring 120Hz refresh rate feature, and color depth are all amazing.  I had to actually back down the color saturation, brightness, and other settings to make the TV more lifelike and not pin you against the wall with intensity.  I truly can't believe there could be a better TV on the market currently.  If Sony beats this picture while costing 35% more, I can't imagine how.I'm not sure what all the uproar is about the red Touch of Color (ToC) on the Samsung TVs.  It's not a light around the rim, it's just a blood red trim ring embedded in clear plastic surrounding the screen.  I have to walk up to the TV to even see it.  If you didn't know it's there, you'd think it was just black like all other TVs.  After all the whining and complaining I've read about it, I thought there was a switch hiding somewhere on the TV or remote to turn it on and off but after reading the Samsung website FAQ about this model, I found out there is no such thing.  In my application, having a pale red backlight facing the wall might have been nice actually.By the way, a super quality wall-mount called a \"Dayton Shadow\" is available at [...] (near Dayton OH) for about 1/4 what you'd pay at BB retail stores and it's exactly the same quality.  I only needed up and down rocking but there are several models that do more swivels or none.I highly recommend this Samsung 52\" TV and plan on having it until the backlight bulb fades in 5 years or so, and then replace the bulb (Samsung's is replaceable) and have it for that long again!  Of course we all know that 2160p TVs will likely show up in 3 or 4 years and 1080p will be old school!", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "An awesome TV for PS3", "Author": "Kevin Burns", "ReviewID": "R7E35NBC0QQ3C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "CEVA shipped the television to my house.  They called the day before to setup a delivery window and also called 30 minutes before arriving on the delivery date to let me know they were coming.  Two guys showed up and carried the TV in, unpacked it, hooked up my DirecTV and PS3 and made sure it was working properly.  They offered to take the box and I said I'd keep it and now my wife is wondering what we are going to do with it (if they offer to take the box, let them).  The total amount of time between them showing up in the driveway and them leaving the house was about 15 minutes at most.The picture quality is nothing short of amazing.  The only setting I've messed with is the AMP settings.  The TV default settings for each input are to have the AMP at \"Medium\".  I turned the setting down to \"Low\" and it seems just right.  I don't have HD through DirecTV as of yet but honestly the standard def picture looks really good.  What I worried most about was gaming on my PS3 and the lag and 'game' mode issues I've read about.  Turns out all that worrying was for nothing.  I don't even swap to 'game' mode but when I have the picture quality is still superb.  I have the PS3 hooked in using HDMI and have no problems with picture quality or lag.  I played demos for Killzone 2, GRiD, MLB '09, Uncharted and didn't notice lag at all.  I also popped in Metal Gear Solid 4 and Unreal Tournament and was blown away by how good these games look on this TV.  Bottom line is if you are a gamer (and I am a hardcore console gamer) you will love this TV, no doubt about it.The sound from the TV is good, no complaints.  But, it's hard not to want to buy an awesome surround sound system for it after watching Transformers on Blu-Ray.  The back of the TV is pretty much flat so that made it easy to install the brackets for the wall mount I ordered for it.  I want to like the remote but I kinda agree with others in that the wheel is cumbersome.  I don't use the wheel at all and instead click on the wheel without turning it, but you have to get used to it because you'll inadvertently turn the wheel while attempting to press on it to click it in the up/down/left/right directions and that gets a bit aggravating.  I programmed my DirecTV remote to work with the TV so I don't even use it anyway except to change inputs and that doesn't require the wheel.  The included cloth to clean the bezel of the TV will create small scratches on the finish so you may want to find something else to clean it with.  Oh yea, there is absolutely NO HALO effect.  Even if there was I don't think I'd care...it's the picture quality that's important to me.Buying this TV through Amazon turned out great. I'm very pleased with them and the delivery company and most of all Samsung for making this TV rock!

Thus, most anything would have been an upgrade. Despite this, my expectations were exceeded. Like many, I researched a ton and the customer reviews were a big help with my decision and want to return the favor.I waffled back and forth between plasma and LCD. I narrowed the choices down to the Pioneer Plasma (Elite Pro 111-FD and PDP 5020-FD), Panasonic (TH-58PZ800U), Sony Bravia XBR KDL-52XBR6, Samsung LN52A650, and the Samsung LN52A750. The picture clarity of the plasmas is very impressive. Of the plasmas, The Panasonic 58 inch seemed to offer the best value in terms of picture and features. However, the Pioneer Elite is good for someone who is a true 'technophile', who really wants to fine tune the picture.I have always been a Sony fan, which made it difficult to choose between the XBR6 and the Samsung a650/a750. I went a few times to the local retailer to compare all of the models for picture quality, sound, and features. Of the LCDs, the picture quality and sound of the Sony and the Samsung seemed identical (both amazing). In the end, I decided on the A750 over A650 (and the Sony) based on price and extra features of the Samsung. The A750 has slightly better processing than the A650 with some extra features for about the same price.1. The white glove delivery from CEVA was pretty good. They only deliver one or two times a week in my area. I seem to hear good things about the other carrier Amazon uses (Pilot). The folks from Ceva were polite, professional, and got the job done.2. Picture Quality - HD channels (I use DirecTV) are amazing. The 'regular channels' also look clear (much better than my old TV and I had a very nice 'tube' TV), but you definitely can tell the difference in HD. I do not have a BluRay player yet, the normal DVD's look extremely clear on this Samsung TV. I do not have any of the 'glare' issues that some reviews have mentioned.3a. Sound quality - The sound quality is very good with the built in sub woofer and SRS. I have an older Sony sound system and hooked it up, which also sounds great (use optical cables or HDMI).3b. Possible sound issue - The speakers are located on the BACK of the TV, which concerned me. However, I have the TV on a large console/stand, which puts the back of the TV about two feet from the wall. Even so, the sound still sounds fantastic. If you are planning on mounting the TV flush against a wall (or with minimal clearance), I would NOT get this Samsung model due to the speakers being located in the back.4. The picture in picture works on this model, but it takes too many steps to use the PIP function. This is the only real downside to this model. However, as much as I thought I would use PIP on my other TV, I never really used it anyway. Things won't change much with this new TV.5. The remote is very easy to use and even aluminates when you pick it up to start using it (very nice feature).6. Some previous reviews noted that some had 'recycling' issues where the power would not turn on. It appears this was addressed with a firmware update in October 2008.I usually get a bad case of buyer's remorse after a large purchase, but I do not regret purchasing the Samsung LN52A750. It seems to be the best value in terms of picture quality and features.By the way, you get an extra three months added to your warranty when you register your TV on the Samsung web site.Happy shopping!", "Date": "February 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!", "Author": "Islander", "ReviewID": "R3P6LSNPI8FKPD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW!!! did I say WOW!!! this is the greatest experience in watching TV I have ever known.

Bollinger", "ReviewID": "R612GW9IYP3S5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, about the TV.  I am really impressed with the quality of this set.  It looks just like the sets on display at B&M; stores (if not better).  I haven't had a chance to explore all of the features yet, but the picture quality was GREAT out of the box.  I would highly recommend this set.  It is well worth the small difference in price over the 650 (less than $100 when I ordered).  There is also virtually no benefit from going with the 850 (yes the 850 is thinner but that size difference translates into only a 7 or 8 lb. weight savings and the $500 price jump is difficult to justify).Second, about ordering from Amazon.  I have to say that the entire experience exceeded my expectations.  Within 48 hours after ordering we received a call to schedule the delivery/setup.  72 hours after ordering, we had the TV setup and in use.  The delivery guy was clearly experienced and was quick and thorough.  He made sure that I didn't have any questions before leaving.  The only surprise was that there was only one guy on the delivery team for a 52\" LCD.  I am hands on, so I was looking forward to participating in setting up the set (but it was still a mild surprise).  In my opinion, no one should have reservations about ordering large ticket electronics from Amazon (unless you want to pay 30% more at a B&M; and have a strong desire to pay sales tax).

I had some reservations about the \"touch of Red\" since my room is primarily blue, but the color is quite subtle and actually looks great.  (In fact, the finish on the entire TV is pretty incredible.)  I considered the A650 but was swayed by the woofer and the DNLA feature which would allow me to play my extensive (6,500+) MP3 songs over my home network - through the TV - into my sound system.Delivery of my TV was exceptional and worth consideration.  I received an email asking me to schedule a specific date and time for delivery.  The delivery service confirmed the delivery by phone a day ahead of time.  The driver brought the unit into the house and into our desired room, unpacked it and checked it over for visual issues.  (none were found)  Truly great delivery service.I hooked the TV up to a Sony 550 BluRay player and have not been able to look away since.  I can't say enough about the stunning quality of the picture.  The 750 series includes a \"woofer\" and the sound is very good.  No, it's not the same as running the sound through my receiver with powered subwoofer and surround speakers but when you just want to watch some TV without waking the neigbbors, it's fine.  The TV also includes TruSurrond XT which seems to give the standard TV sound just a bit more of a 3-D effect without sounding phony.I have just a couple things that I would like to see improved.The DNLA feature works as described.  I can play MP3's of view photos over my home network.  (I have thousands of songs and photos stored on a networked computer.)  There are several features to order the songs by title or artist, etc.  However you cannot play the music in random order and sorting/navigating through a large collection is a bit awkward.  In a similar manner, you can't view your photos randomly.  But it would be VERY DESIRABLE to view my photos while playing my music through this system.  You can't.  Also, after a few minutes of listening to music, the screen goes into a power saving mode and displays a black screen with a randomly flashing \"Samsung\" logo.Apparently you can copy your MP3's AND JPG files to a USB drive and plug that into the TV to play music and pictures, but that is not nearly as desirable as playing over the network.  I have not really tried this feature and don't know how it performs.Bottom line is that I love this TV.  Excellent finish, picture quality and delivery service.  Since the TV is hooked up to the Internet through my home network, it can download software updates from Samsung.  I hope that in the future, Samsung will revisit the DNLA software and perhaps add the Random function and allow both music and pictures to display concurrently.", "Date": "February 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "MmmMmmMmmmmmm!", "Author": "Heath", "ReviewID": "R1KKBWM4XWKHXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a beaut!!!  I did a lot of research on this TV and based my purchase on all the positive reviews I read.  If there's an extremely negative review, it was likely a very unlucky person/purchase.  I've had this TV since October 2008 (4 months) and watch dvds about 96% of the time (Blu-ray and regular).  It's a beautiful picture (adjusted by myself to my taste) all the time.  I have one gripe:  the \"motion lag\" or \"ghosting\".  Apparently this is common in all LCD tv's (hence the 5-star rating)...but I'm not a big fan.  I sure didn't see it at Best Buy on ANY of their TV's.  Oh well, that small complaint is easily overcome with all of the other amazingness on the screen.  Oh, and the bezel picture/light reflection you may read about is not a real big deal.  If you're focused on the screen, it goes unnoticed.  If you look for it, you'll see it.  Other than that, all the menus are professional looking and easy to use, the LAN updating is slow but a great feature (wired rather than USB for me), the remote is great (though the spinning button is a little too easy to spin), and it looks amazing in my living room.I highly recommend this TV or any of the ones with the same/similar specifications.  Samsung is on a roll with their TVs.  Stick to [...] too.  DO NOT buy anything from ANY companies out of Brooklyn (or if the price seems too good to be true).

After reviewing the pricing, we decided on the 52\" LN52A750.Shipping: We were under the impression when we purchased it that we were getting \"White Glove\" shipping.  Sorry, if you don't see it listed, you get \"front door\" delivery and you have to install it by yourself.  It turns out that the way the shipping box is made, installation is a breeze and there were no issues.  Not a big deal.The TV: It took me a while to get the Dish Network Channels/input to the right buttons on the \"so-called\" inept or dysfunctional remote. After a few minutes, the TV picked up the input feed and it was unbelievable. We immediately watched a MLB game and were literally shocked by the clarity of the picture.The remote: I think it works just fine.  The circular \"wheel\" thingy is sensitive yes, but works just fine after few tries.Halo:  We saw it with all the lights out in the room, and really had to look for it.  It is not annoying to us and don't notice it all.Other people's comments:  Our friends stopped by to see the new TV. They own a 52\" Sony XBR Bravia.  The husband said that it was just as good if not better than his Sony TV.  He came back to watch a HD college football game the next day...Stored Content:  Running the stored contents is absolutely beautiful.

So we took the plunge for the new tv to replace our perfectly fine Sony SXRD!  Until yesterday I thought the Sony had the best picture I have ever seen.  Then we hooked up the new 750.Shipping arrived early in the delivery window.  The delivery guy helped me move my old TV, then unpack and place this one.  I signed after I inspected the TV.First, install was a breeze, easy to unpack and place.  Cable hookup is very quick as you would expect.Next I configured the settings using AVS Forums recommended settings.Before the adjustments the screen was a bit red. The changes took the picture from a bit red to a little cool, IMO.  But it is a VERY pleasing picture.First movie out of the gate was a Live Free Or Die Hard.  I felt like I could touch the pilot in the F35... watching the scene in the frozen room was incredible!  I almost felt cold.  SD feeds look better than expected given the resolution and clarity of the panel.The translucent border has not given any issues in daylight or night viewing (with an overhead light).  The screen looks a bit bigger than the actual size.  The sound is not bad from the tv.  It would certainly do if you don't have a home theater setup.What an upgrade this TV is proving to be!Only a con or two:I don't like remote layout.  The jog dial is very slow moving onscreen cursor.Takes a little longer to come on than I expected.

Within 3 days of placing the order, TV was delivered into my living room and set up. Delivery service person was professional and very courteous.By the weekend, I had my TV service switched over to DirectTV (90 HD channels)that included HBO, Starz, Showtime and Cinemax.  This TV is fabulous!!!  It works perfectly, colors (on standard default) are beautiful and movies appear as though the actors are half out of the screen. The sound set to \"movie\" is equally impressive.  For those wishing to fiddle, TV has a multitude of setting that can be adjusted - at the end of the day, the defaults work just fine!Before purchasing this set, I researched for several weeks looking for one of the best sets on the market that was reasonably priced. It was funny how sales associates from both Best Buy and Circuit City said the Samsung picture quality and their service after the sale was one of the highest in the industry placing it above Sony.  The review on CNET helped confirm what I had been reading and witnessing in comparing various models that included Sony, Sharp, Panasonic to name a few. Additionally, I had read about the \"glow\" around the edges due to the red trimmed bezel.  I currently have my TV set sitting on a stand at eye level and there is absolutely NO glow, etc. with all lights turned off in the middle of the night, etc.  Additionally, I do not have reflections or any of the other things some people have reported.  I could not be happier and would highly recommend this TV to anyone (including my mother)who wants their socks blown off. Friends that have seen it cannot believe the picture quality and features (USB, etc.)!In closing, once I ordered my TV from Amazon, I noticed several days later that their price had dropped by $109. I called their customer support number and told the representative what had happened. Before I could ask, the gentleman I spoke with told me he had issued a $109 credit against my credit card.

It really makes for a much more informed purchase.I took some time and stopped by the local 'big box' retailer to see the halo effect on the bezel. I recommend that anyone ready to purchase this TV do the same and really see for yourself if this is something that would bother you. Personally, I saw the effect and have no problem with it. For those who haven't seen it...it is a reflection of the TV picture along the angled cut on the outer edge of the glass frame. You see a slight mirror image especially when a white background is being displayed. So if someone is walking along a white floor near the bottom of the screen you can follow them in the reflection as well. I took two things into account when deciding this was not a part of my purchase decision: 1. The reflection is somewhat position-dependent and is very, very thin; 2. When you are paying attention to the images on the screen, any halo effect is blended into your periferal vision and you don't notice it. Try it for yourself to see if you think such an issue would outweigh any other benefits.Outside of this, the overall experience is just plain better than any other product in its price range. Take some time and find a retailer that has this product next to a Sony or similar model.

They've been from Panasonic, Sony, Samsung, and Sharp. Without a doubt, the 750 series Samsung has been the best overall performer with both SD and HD inputs. The pictures are very accurate right out of the box if you switch over to the preset \"Movie mode\" and very little calibration is needed. It handles motion extremely well (120 hz refresh rate) and there is very little color contouring. Off axis viewing is amazing for an LCD and on par with most plasmas. When you add in the overall efficiency in operation (225w power consumption vs. over 700w for an equivalent sized plasma) it gets even better.The \"Touch of Color\" aesthetic is nice but not a really big thing.

If your idea of a great television is one that delivers the best picture you have ever seen on a television then this is the set for you as of August 2008. I have no doubts that as technology improves the picture on this set will be surpassed. However, the picture here is so good that some of the movie sets look fake. Which is actually a little distracting. So further improvement if possible might not be a plus.I was tempted to lower my review of this TV because of the speakers. The speakers are rear facing from the back of the cabinet. This was no doubt done to improve the appearance of the front of the TV etc. Still if you do not intend to use a speaker system this is not the television for you.

I say that because the tracking number said the TV was still in SLC in the morning and I got a call at lunch asking if I would be home to take delivery!  Now it's hooked up and man, all I keep saying to myself is, \"WOW.\"  The picture quality is amazing.  The high def stuff that comes off the antenna is so sharp and clear, and with the 52\" screen, it's like the people are standing in front of me.  I watched some beach volleyball the day I set it up (it was the only thing in High Def that I could watch) and you could see the individual beads of sweat on the players.  When I finally sat down to dail in the picture and sound with everything hooked up (reciever, dvd, tv) I put in \"Star Wars\" and \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" to test things out since they are the only discs I have in Dolby EX.

We buy a lot of things on the internet, but this is the largest item by far, and fairly concerned on what happens with the shipment.

They unpacked the TV, moved it over to our new tv stand, waited while I connected the tv and made sure it worked fine with our cable connection. All this took only about 15 minutes, but they were very patient and courteous. They removed the box and packing materials, and made sure we had the UPC label, pointing out the serial # and other materials they saved from the shipment.The Samsung TV itself is amazing.

They said, \"No, we think that we get it to your house in Phoenix on the 11th maybe the 10th.\"  To say I was surprised was a under statement. On the afternoon of the 9th, CIVA called and left a voice mail to set up a delivery for the next day! I did not get the message until around 7:00 that night. I decided to call anyway just to see if the recording would give the office hours.  Much to my suprise (again) they were still in the office and set up my delivery for the 10th at 1:00 to 4:00 the next day!!!  They called the morning of the 10th to confirm my time and arrived at 2:00.  When the CEVA delivery men arrived, they said the (undamaged) box was dirty on the bottom and asked for a blanket or towel to keep the carpet from getting dirty while they set up the TV. When is the last time you has a service man conserned about tracking in dirt?  And as avertised, they unpackaged and set it up and tested it to make sure it worked and at the same time were very courtious even in our 109 degree heat. My White Glove delivery really was as advertised.  In addition, the HDMI cables that I order at the same day as the TV arrived on the 9th (7 days early) from 2 diffrent vendors and were in perfect shape and work well.Now for the TV, this is our first LCD HD TV and all I can say is WOW!!  It is in a room with windows on 2 sides and it is absolutely the best picture I could of hoped for. The is a little reflection of the frame but it does not impact the picture.  The first thing we wached was the DiamondBacks and there was no motion blur what so ever when the ball was moving.  We are hooked up to Cox HD and it performs well.  The hook up to the cable, DVD and sterio reciever was fairly straight forward and took me about one and a half hours.  The instructions were OK but not real clear on some of the control changes needed to get the input cable signal.  They are right on the little ipod type scroll wheel on the remote.  It is a little frustrating at first, but once the set up is achieve it is not used that much.I estimate that I saved approximately $800 over the \"lowest price\" big box store in the Phoenix metro area and the projected delivery time for them was 2 weeks later and cost only $60.00!!Just a reminder, I am writing this reveiw on the 12th, which is 4 days BEFORE my oringinal delivery date of all the items ordered from Amazon.

To me, it's not distracting.The speaker system on the TV is great for \"TV Speakers\" I was really impressed.

It just looks fantastic!  The 'demo' pictures that are stored on the TV look stunning and really show off the TV's PQ.Again, the colors look amazing right out of the box, I didn't make any major adjustments other than flipping between the pre-defined modes (Game, Cinema etc...), the colors are amazing, the blacks are a nice deep black, the picture just really stands out, especially on an HD channel.I haven't played too much with the 120hz setting. I had it off, and while I didn't watch any sports, the news ticker across the bottom of the screen didn't seem to 'jitter' at all. Maybe with lots of movement on different parts of the screen I will need to enable it, but currently I have it off and I don't notice any jitter.CEVA Delivered a day early than was on the tracking site.

I haven't been able to play with the additional items in the 750 that are not included in the 650, but the price difference at the time of purchase from Amazon made choosing the 750 a no-brainer. Otherwise I would have gone with the 650, either way you will not be disappointed with this set's picture and performance.Update:It's been almost 3 weeks since I got the TV. I have had others over who have HDTV's and they are blown away by the Samsung. Standard DVD's look awesome, and HDTV broadcasts via Brighthouse look sweet. I watched Casino Royal on ShowtimeHD, and it was incredible.  The cable-box said it was 1080i (the highest I think the box will do) and it was amazing. The best thing is, I havent had to really mess with any of the picture settings as far as Color, Hue, Staturation etc... I have just tried the different \"modes\" that come preset and they work great.If you are looking at HDTV's in this price range, I'd seriously consider just getting this one. Or even the A650, you wont be sorry. This TV just rocks!", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic LCD TV!!!!!", "Author": "S.

Many other BD players offer this feature but it is done in software rather than using hardware - the 2550 has a dedicated hardware chip that handles this and it is STELLAR.One word of caution - if you, like us, route your TV audio to an externally powered speaker set (such as a boom-box, table stereo, or PC-type speakers) then be aware that the audio output jacks on the rear of the TV are NOT variable audio output - they always stay the same volume.  This creates a problem with adjusting the volume using the remote when using external speakers with the internal speakers off.  Our solution was an adapter cable for the TV's headphone jack output.  When you plug in the adapter cable the TV speakers mute and output is directed to the adapter cable, which you then plug into your external powered speakers.

It was brand new and was unpacked in my living room.  The TV was used at that location and never moved or bumped.For the first 2 1/2 years, the TV worked just fine.  Then the audio started becoming poor at higher volumes.  Something rattled to the bass sound in music.Under extended warranty plan, the TV speakers were replaced (all four).  During the repair the technicians found multiple places where the molded plastic studs at screw locations were cracked and broken.  They reassembled the case as best they could, and the vibration continued.  It turns out, the vibration comes from the brittle, broken case, not the speakers.  The case cannot be firmly attached, because the screw heads have nothing to rest on when the bottom of the molded stud channels are gone.  Where the studs continue to exist, the screws strip out in the bezel.  No power tools were ever used in the repairs.After that event, the front bezel around the screen was loose multiple places around the case.  I also noticed vertical green lines starting to show up on the left side of the screen.  I called to have the sound, video, and case repaired under my extended warranty.They came out and replaced three boards, including video.  This did not improve things.  So they put the original boards back in and left.  They did not replace the case, to my disappointment.While I was working with the warranty company for another potential visit, the TV developed a new problem where the TV would turn on and off constantly, never staying on long enough to use.  It turns out the power supply board had blown capacitors and needed replaced.  I found out on the internet this is a common problem with all Samsungs during several years of manufacture.Later, the warranty company told me they cannot fix the TV because everything in the TV needs replaced (LCD screen, case, bezel, power board...) I had to settle for the current value of the TV (about 1/3 of what I paid).Overall, I cannot believe a company with such brand-name recognition makes a high-end product fraught with poor design.  A case with plastic that becomes brittle and self-destructs, a bezel with poor retention strength for screws, an LCD screen that loses connection with the video signal, a power board with underrated capacitors, and inadequate vibration isolation near the speakers.I would never buy another product that is made by \"Samsung\".

Being over two months out of the manufacturers one year warranty factory warranty, and I opted not to get the extended warranty via Best Buy, I didn't think there was any hope for me. So I dialed Samsung and asked what my options were. They informed me that the only option is to replaced the panel. Being that I was out of the manufacturers warranty, the lady on the phone told me there was not much Samsung could do, but that I could file a claim and see what happens. Well I filed a claim and the same day a different lady called and informed me that Samsung was going to pay for my LCD panel to be replaced with a brand new panel.

It is incredible.  The dynamic adjustments to the contrast are seamless. I also have a Samsung Blu-Ray player so I take advantage of the AnyNet technology. Using HDMI connections makes a big difference over the Component Video -- the detail is outstanding. The 120 hz motion can sometimes be too much at the high settings (I keep it low) since it tends to show you movement you don't see with the naked eye. (It can make you a little dizzy so I cannot imagine why anyone would want or need the newer 240 hz technology). Even old black & white movies are beautiful on this TV.  I also have connect a PC via the DVI and a laptop with HDMI with extremely good results. There are no dead pixels anywhere.The sound is good considering the size of the built-speakers but I run it through a Yamaha 5.1 channel AV receiver which of course, makes it more than realistic clarity.Not too many complaints here --- I wish the remote control was programmable but its not (neither is the remote for the Blu-Ray).  For wireless LAN, you have to use the Samsung adapter which is no longer available but the Ethernet is fine.

The only criticism I have is that last summer the \"frame\" began warping away from the screen. As of now, about 25% of the frame has pulled loose. The only way it can be noticed is from the side. The problem doesn't interfere with the function of the TV and the rest of the frame is still secure for now. My only guess as to what caused the warping is the window air conditioner that was installed on that side of the TV, 3 feet away. Other than that, the reason is a mystery. There are no heat sources within 10' of the set & it never is touched by sunlight. I would only reduce my \"stars\" by 1, for the warped frame, as the set still functions perfectly.1st REVIEW -I have deliberately waited almost a year to write this review. I purchased this TV from the Amazon Warehouse as a \"used\" item (1st time I've tried this option) with a \"scratch\" on the case. I can't find the scratch!The Tv was delivered ontime by 2 guys who unpacked it & placed it on the stand. They powered it up & checked it out before they left, making sure I was happy. They even cleaned up the packing mess.I am still in awe of this television. It is everything I wanted. Visitors always comment on the quality of the picture & I happily refer them to Amazon.The next thing on my wish list is a Blu-Ray player - I wonder what the picture will look like then? How could it possibly get any better?I would rate my experience with this purchase as a 10 for price,product & service (the 1st 10 I've ever given anything).", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "HDTV IS BETTER THAN DESCRIBED!!! perfect in every way!", "Author": "Lyn \"TAROT LOVER!!!\"", "ReviewID": "RYYXHMYE0SLNO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the very BEST TV that I have ever owned!!!I am so excited to share a few things with you about my purchase.DELIVERY:Delivery was VERY smooth...make sure you get the \"white glove\" service if you don't have someone to help you because the box is huge and it takes TWO men to carry it inside. PLUS the delivery men take it out of the box and plug it in and check it to make sure that it didn't get damaged during transporting. Worth the extra money!SETUPI had Dish Tv come and set it up for me because I bought a new HD TV receiver and I am a woman...so better to have Dish do it than me trying to figure it out...however, the connections and the book look very simple after all!PICTURE SETTINGS V/S FACTORY SETTINGSThe picture is so perfect, that I have never even wanted to adjust it...I think the \"factory settings\" are PERFECT, and wonderfully bright and clear and I am VERY excited over the picture quality of this Samsung TV.TOUCH OF COLOR V/S GLARE?Regarding the \"Touch of Red Color\"...I can't even notice any red touch of color at all..it is SO SUBTLE... and there is NO glare or problem with it either in the daylight or the nightlight.It's PERFECT...don't know what others were fussing about!!??\"FIVE DIFFERENT SIZES\" of PICTURE...your choice!Here is something no one has talked about (not in any of the previous reviews):This is a feature that I LOVE SO MUCH...and that is: You have \"Five different\" sizes or ways that you can view your picture in! That is right. Here are the following sizes that you can control from your remote (even with my Dish remote):1. you can use the \"normal\" size which takes on whatever the show is offering the program in...2. You can use the \"stretch\" size which stretches the whole picture from side to side and it does fill out the \"whole\" screen...3. you can use the \"partial zoom\" which \"enlarges\" the whole picture...4. you can use the \"zoom\" size which reallyenlarges the total picture on your screen... great if you have company that is sitting further away...5. You can use the \"gray bar\" which has an about \"4\" gray stripe on each side with the picture in the middle (no gray strips on the top or bottom...and this looks very nice).The \"normal size\" picture sometimes fills up the whole screen but sometimes has \"black \"4\" strips on the sides of the picure (like the gray bars size), but it depends on the program or movie you watch...because the \"normal size\"will change with the program...but you can change it to any of the \"5 different size settings\" with your remote...I LOVE THIS FEATURE!!! Keeps you from getting bored...but most of all you can try all the different 5 sizes to seewhich one makes the picture look the best...LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!...and can't believe that no one ever mentioned thisin their reviews that I read.WHY I BOUGHT A SAMSUNGThe reason I bought this brand is because I went to several large stores selling TVs and looked and compared alltheir tvs that were displayed next to each other...WOW...the Samsung totally BLOWS ALL the other brands OUT OF THE WATER PEOPLE!!! Go and see for yourself... I had to laugh, that at one store, they had the Samsung tvs and the Samsung Blu-Ray player completely far away from the other brands...or they would probably not be able to sell the others!!!

I mainly play driving, fighting, and Madden games, and they are almost unplayable because of the lag when you hit a button and see the result on the tv (especially on the driving games - GRID).  Seems like the lag is as much as a quarter of a second, but it is enough to make the driving games practically unplayable.  I'm not sure if this is a problem with other 120Hz tvs??The only option is to put the tv on \"game\" mode, which cuts down on the lag time, but it still appears there is a slight lag.

I spent about a week researching TVs, reading reviews, asking friends and co-workers. I found this TV at the time for $100 cheaper at some of the other online stores, but the customer service reviews were very mixed. For peace of mind, I wanted to stick with a well-known organization such as Amazon. When the driver delivered it (exactly one week after purchase), he handled the TV with great care, unpackaged it, lifted it on top of the TV stand and turned it on to make sure it works.I'm very pleased with the TV so far. This is my first HDTV LCD. I had a 52\" Sony Rear Projection before this and the High-def channels are absolutely sick on this TV. I can't imagine going back to the conventional TVs after this. My wife loves it so much she's now actually considering letting me buy a smaller LCD for the bedroom.I didn't go with the ridiculously expensive Monster HDMI cables. I found an excellent HDMI cable from Mediabridge on Amazon for quite cheap ($9.99). Check it out - there's over 300 reviews and all 5 stars! Shortly after receiving the TV, I went to BJs and purchased a SONY Blu-Ray player. It's like a whole different movie experience on this TV!!The clarity of the TV is great. I chose this model over the 650 simply because I thought the straight edges of the TV and the stand (650 is rounded) just looked much more crisp. My enterntainment center is cherry wood and the TV just looks awesome! I've gotten several compliments from family and friends on how much they love the TV. I may have even convinced a few to get one of their own.I haven't used the DLNA features yet. Not sure if I ever will to be honest - too lazy to relocate my modem and router. And not sure if I'd ever really use those features to begin - although they look pretty cool and I am major techie geek.The manual is pretty straight forward and so is the setup. It took me a little bit of time to setup the picture settings and get the surround sound to work. All it takes is just a bit of patience and you'll figure it out. Tidbit: If you have a HD/DVR box, make sure you set the \"Picture setting\" to \"Regular\" (mine was set to \"Zoom\" for some reason). It took me forever to figure out why, when I was watching 2 and 1/2 men, Charlie Sheen's head looked enormoous.Buy this TV - great price - you won't be dissapointed.

I had originally bought this t.v. from one of the Big Box stores locally and was very pleased with the product, but when the (supposedly) comparable W-series model from Sony went on sale for $500 less I decided to return the Samsung for the Sony. Big Mistake! After having the Sony for less than 10 days I couldn't get over how washed out and drab the picture was. I couldn't even compare the \"Vivid\" setting on the Sony to the \"Standard\" setting on the Samsung, the difference was that significant. And don't even get me started on comparing 'standard-def' television on the 2 models. The Sony feels like I'm watching a 20-yr old set with rabbit-ears for reception.My father had purchased the Sony because of the sale and he kept telling me that for $500 difference he was very happy with his Sony. Well, I couldn't stand it any longer remembering the beauty of the picture of the Samsung and finally decided to return the Sony to the Big Box store and (re-)purchase the Samsung through Amazon. It was within $200 of the price of the much cheaper Sony through the BB store! Still much cheaper than my original purchase of the first Samsung.After receiving the product from Amazon and watching it for about 2 weeks I kept noticing trouble with 'ghosting' images with any moderate to fast speed movement on the screen. I called Customer Service and they were absolutely a pleasure to deal with in getting a replacement out to me after contacting Samsung direct and finding out that the unit was defective. The defective unit was picked up when the new unit was delivered, which was in a shorter time frame than the Customer Service rep had said!Overall I can't say how hassle-free and easy it was dealing with the extremely professional and pleasant staff at Amazon. And what about my Dad and his Sony? After coming over to check out the picture quality of the Samsung, he wants to know if he can return his Sony and pay the difference to upgrade to the much better Samsung!From now on, I will give my business to Amazon and you should too.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be hapier", "Author": "K.

The colors and clarity are crazy good. My friends and family who have been over to watch the NCAA tournament or movies with us are blown away by how good the picture is. There are times that I'm still giddy while sitting on my couch and watching this set.This is my third Samsung television - my second LCD from them. Each one has been nothing short of great.Now that I've raved about the set, I do need to describe my experience with Amazon's white glove service delivery.  It was good, but not what I expected. I ordered this TV and was contacted by a delivery company in about 3-4 days on a Friday. They were going to be at my house on Monday morning. Normally, that would be good because it's a quick delivery, but I'd rather schedule the delivery for Tuesday because I'll already have the day off.  I call to reschedule and they are already closed for the weekend.  I get home to hear a voice mail that they'll be at my house on Monday morning. So, now I'm stuck staying home on Monday morning.The delivery crew called before 8am to confirm they were about 20 minutes away, so communications were good. But, I'd still prefer to have not been there that day. When they arrived, two guys carried the box in, set it down and the second guy walked out to the truck while one stayed to have me sign the papers. Granted, I was not ready for him to hang up my set, but I at least wanted to inspect the set. He explained that the set cannot be turned on due to the cold in the truck overnight and that morning. I understood and agreed with that. What I disagreed with was signing a paper that said I \"directed them not to turn on the TV\" or something to that effect.So, I crossed my fingers and signed the papers after looking over the screen.I'm not sure these guys were ever fully prepared to have stayed to turn on the set and walk me through it. They definitely were more on the delivery-only side of things in my opinion. That being said, free delivery on a set this good and a much lower price than any B&M; store make this set well worth the investment.", "Date": "April 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best LCD on the market", "Author": "Diamond Jim", "ReviewID": "R2UKFXTJO467H9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality on this set is fantastic!

The sound for a TV is very good imo, plenty of volume, but not sure I would call it surround. Ran it this way for several days before the 7.1 surround receiver arrived and speakers were hooked up in 5.1 mode. Picture quality is excellent, with excellent detail, accurate color, and brightness. I have so far played blue ray movies via a PS3 which is just like being there, and upscaled from VHS and standard DVD player (good quality, but not as well as the engine in the Onkyo TX-NR906 receiver). Over air HDTV, satellite, or the ethernet capability has not been tried due to the current setup location, I will update once this has happened. I like the look of the \"Touch of Color\" bezel with minimal red at the edge, and so far in the month I have had it has not cracked.

Shepherd \"mausdesign\"", "ReviewID": "R2FXUMIIBG6T4Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched many Samsung and Sony LCD HDTV models for a couple months prior to my purchase and was originally wanting the LN52A850, but was not able to justify the difference in price for the thin-ness of that model. I ended up buying the LN52A750 when it finally hit my Gold Box at $1880.00. I scheduled for a Monday delivery, but it ended up arriving three days earlier -- I was very happy about having it for the weekend, so thanks Amazon!On the upside - It shipped with a newer firmware than was on the website, so no upgrade was needed. It has very fluid motion response and excellent picture quality, even with 120Hz Auto Motion Plus on the High setting. The Content Library is nice, and although some of the downloaded digital photos for the Gallery part did not work (some showed blank), the photos were very high quality and really show off the TV. The kids enjoyed the story and songs (though they were visually quite amateurish). Hopefully, Samsung will expand upon the Content Library. Also to note, even though the manual claims that the USB port does not support hard drives, after I formatted (Fat32) and attached a 30GB 2.5\" IDE hard drive via an ATA/USB adapter, the TV was able to both power and read it without difficulty. I'm guessing the only reason they don't officially support attaching hard drives is because the results will most certainly vary among brands of drives and of drive enclosures.On the downside - DLNA is not all that great. Using EyeConnect on a new MacBook Pro, I discovered there was some weird video skipping even when both Mac and TV were directly connected to a new Netgear ProSafe Gigabit Switch. I suspect it might be a hardware issue rather than software, because although I can't confirm, I'm guessing they might be using a 10-baseT ethernet port on the TV, which would most likely be the cause of a throughput issue. I'm not taking off for this, because I'd already expected to connect a Mac to play movies directly to the TV via HDMI cable/DVI adapter with optical audio through my sound system.One odd thing I noticed, however, is when the TV is attached via HDMI/DVI to a Mac, even though it reports as 1920x1080i, it starts off actually displaying as at 1920x1080p (1920x1080p doesn't even show as a selectable option in the Displays Preference Pane). When switching to a lower resolution, then back to the 1920x1080i setting, it actually does change it to 1080i - the picture quality goes down and the interlace scanning makes it look like crap. The only way to get back to Full 1080p is to use the Displays Menu Recent Settings (to see this, click the Show in Menu option in the Displays Preference Pane). It is most likely a driver issue under Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard (I tried the latest of both versions on two different Macs). However, as long as I'm able to get back to the highest quality, then that is all I really care about.All-in-all, I'm very happy with our purchase. And, out of 21 digital channels we get over the air here in Decatur, GA, about 1/3 of them are HD. My brother came over and was also blown away at the picture quality we were getting with it. With awesome HDTV over the air, who needs to pay $$$ for cable or satellite?

Anyone who has made a serious purchase online could probably remember their first one.  I was indeed nervous, but after doing ALOT of research on both the TV and Amazon, I went ahead and purchased this Samsung LN52A750.I went into this purchase with a budget of around 1500.  I went to circuit city for a store closing and that is where I first seen the set.  It was indeed a GORGEOUS set, both cosmetically, and picture quality.  Circuit City  was asking for $2500 for the floor model.  I loved the set, but unfortunately, it was over my budget by $1000.  I started to mentally settle on a 46\" Sony that they had there for $1950.  But as with all my major purchases, I Wanted to shop around a little more and compare.  While shopping at bestbuy, i noticed that the LN52A750 was there for $2899.  It looked even better at bestbuy with a Blu-Ray of Madagascar playing.  Still, this was only a dream to me because the price was so high.  That night, I was talking to a friend of mine about the TV's and I was telling him that I really liked the Samsung sets that I have seen on display.  I was at home, and I punched in the model number in google just to show my friend the TV, and show him how expensive it was.  Google pulled up Amazon's listing of the set.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY WHEN I SEEN THE PRICE!!!  Amazon had it for $1924, tax-free, with free delivery.  That's over $1000 cheaper than bestbuy!  HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE???? I didn't believe it at first.  So I started to do my research, trying to find out more about Amazon's reputation for selling online.  After doing ALOT of reading, I decided to roll my dice and purchase this bad boy online.  I must say, Amazon was SUPERB in their salesmanship!!!  They were in contact with me both by e-mail and by telephone during my wait for delivery.  My TV came 5 days before the estimated delivery date.  The television was delivered to my house, the bought it up the stairs where I live on the second floor, and into my home.  They opened the box for me to assure me that it was not damaged for delivery.  They would have also plugged in my set to test it, but it was too cold outside, and they are not allowed to turn it on when it is less that 50 degrees outside (It stated so on my delivery papers).  The TV sat in the box for 5 days while I awaited a day off to mount that puppy on my wall.  WHAT A GORGEOUS TV SET!!!! So gorgeous, that it changes the way the room looks that you put it in.  Plus, the new TV inspires my wife to keep the living room spotless (LOL)!  All in all, I would never buy anything this expensive from a department store ever again!!!!! I am now hooked on buying online, especially from Amazon!  These department/electronics superstores are going to continue to go out of business (Tweeter/CircuitCity/ect.) and it is NOT because of our bad economy.

Did a lot of research before buying the Samsund A750. Exceptional HD picture quality that razzle-dazzles my friends. Easy set-up with onscreen instructions. I particularly like the translucent menu screens that allows you to view the picture and make any adjustments. The remote is fine. The rotating ring is no big deal. If you don't like turning the menu selection ring on the remote, you just click on it instead. No distracting reflections coming from the frame at all.The preloaded content includes nature scenes that rotate in a slide show. It is entertaining and useful as a display but is no big deal. The cooking program and other stuff is interesting to see once but doubt you would use them again.The built-in speakers are adequate but don't compare to an external home theatre set-up. Even if you just use the TV speakers, the unit will sound fine.I haven't tried viewing content from a PC but I can see value in doing a living room presentation with a room full of folks.It was intesting to note that the delivery driver mentioned never having a Samsung 7 series returned, but was being kept busy with unhappy purchasers of Vizio TVs being returned due to different kinds of problems.This is the unit for you. Trust me and take the plunge for this honey of an LCD. Even after using it for a month, it still makes me smile when I turn it on.

Shipping company contacted me to arrange delivery and arrived without even any small exterior box damages. Because everyone has a different local delivery company your delivery experience will vary. I only had one person deliver my TV so I helped out. Very friendly and stayed till I opened up the box to check it out. TV arrived in perfect condition and set up with my PS3 and Direct tv HD-DVR was easy. I also purchased a calibration DVD-Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics [Blu-ray] for less than $20 bucks and used it to calibrate the picture settings. The TV didn't need much in the way of adjustments right out of the box. The included extra's installed from the factory from recipes to picure galleries where a nice extra. The picture galley photos are breathtaking on the TV running like a screen saver. I was surprised that I liked the TV's sound much better than some of the reviews would have led me to believe. This is the first TV I have owned that had the speakers installed in the back of the TV with the sound radiating from behind it. With the TV on my new TV stand (Grand Aspirations Casual Country 52-Inch TV Console, Cherry) also from amazon it looks and sounds great. It is up against a flat wall so who knows what it would sound like if it was in a corner or out away from the wall. One of the only things I didn't think about before buying this LCD. I must say that the picture when not viewing an HDTV signal was less than pleasing (which is to be expected). With the HD satelite channels this TV really shines. I was surprised how well even regular DVD movies looked when played thru my PS3. Blu-ray movies are crazy beautiful (still waiting for Gladiator to be released on blu-ray). I happened to turn the TV on a nascar race in HD last week (normally don't watch) and not just myself but unbelievably my wife also stopped and watched most of the race, just because the picture was captivating. Have had no problems with the glass edge or screen reflecting light while watching.

I also like being able to save songs onto a flash drive and plug the flash drive into USB port on the side of the TV and play my music from there.  No problems with glare and I love the rich black bezel with hint of red around it.  In some reviews I read where there seems to be a \"halo\" effect caused by the bezel.  I do not seem to have that problem.  It may be the way the other reviewers have their TV positioned in relation to ambient light in the room.

I was able to compare all the models side by side with the 750, and surprisingly, I thought the Toshiba was the only one to give it and the 850 a run for their money, at least on the display floor.  Other, online reviews of the Toshiba weren't as kind, and it was more expensive.In the end, I decided the 850 was also out of my price range, so I took home the 750.  When I compared it side by side with the 650, I did see enough of a difference to justify the increased price, which in the end, really wasn't very much.After three weeks, I'm extremely happy with the capabilities this TV has.  I have it hooked up to the Samsung HT-AS720 surround sound system and the BD-P2500 blu-ray player, and together they have really been a joy to watch.A quick word of warning - Standard Definition television channels are not going to look very good on this television.  Some will be worse than others, but even if you are on cable or satellite but decide not to make use of their HD package, then you may want to rethink your television purchase.We also purchased 6-Foot Gold-Plated HDMI 1.3 CAT 2 Cable Male to Male for HD HDTV High Definition Digital Multimedia Audio / Video (Retail, RoHS, UL Compliant)from amazon a week before picking up the TV, and they work extremely well.  I would avoid getting caught without these cables before you buy because retailers tend to push the expensive ones very hard.Samsung also offers a feature called Anynet+ that allows different Samsung products to 'talk' to one another and allows the user to use one remote to control them all.  This feature is only so-so - if you have a cable or satellite remote, you will still be switching between the two.  I plan eventually to get an all in one.I was afraid of the glare issue, and that was one of the things that made the Toshiba so attractive.  After several weeks in the house, I can tell you that the glare has been a very minimal issue.  Occasionally, at night, I'll turn off one of the lamps in the living room that's in a direct line with the TV, but that's really the only problem I've had.I am extremely happy with this TV, and have been watching far more than is my norm.  I don't know if that's good or not, but I've enjoyed all of it.  I don't even mind watching my fiancee's shows.

I've never been so impressed with a television.  I kept catching myself just yelling out \"WOW\" like a little kid.You've heard all of the rave reviews about the picture.

Yes, there is glare when the TV is OFF, but when it's on, I don't notice it except on the darkest of scenes in the blackest areas.  I don't find it distracting.Touch of colorBARELY noticeable, but a nice touch.Sound - Some say the sound on this set is not good.  I was thoroughly impressed out of the box and haven't even tweaked the settings.  Clear, good bass, crisp ambient sounds.  I think the volume goes up to 100 on the scale, and it was too loud for me at 20.Picture is TOO realistic.  Film looks like live video - On some movies you'll notice this.  The fix is to turn the 120Hz setting off or to the lowest setting, set the picture to Movie and Warm 1 or 2.  This is good on more artsy films and character studies.  Turn it on for special affects movies, sports and animation.Double reflection on bezel.  Yes, I noticed a reflection of the picture on the edge of the bezel.  But it's no big deal.  It would be like complaining about the lit exit sign next to the screen at a movie theater.If this TV is in your price range and you don't have a room condusive to plasma, stop deliberating.  Get this.  You will NOT be disappointed.Also, if you're getting your TV shipped via CEVA and you can't wait for the delivery to be made on THEIR schedule, they may let you come get it.

There was a problem with the order and was placed on hold but then the price went up. Amazon folks were great in correcting the problem and maintaining the lower price. Received the TV in about 5 days and couple of guys came in hooked it up and took all the boxes with them. Great service by Amazon. The TV had some green casting (no reds) but thought it just needed some adjustments. Tried everything the manual stated and then gave a call to Samsung. The Customer service representative at Samsung tried to help but she wasn't getting anywhere so transferred me to another person with more knowledge. She suggested I hook up my DVD player and give it a whirl. Sure enough DVD showed a perfect picture so it had to be the cable box. Samsung handled the situation wonderfully now I'm a loyal fan of theirs. Called the cable company (Comcast) and they needed to reset the box for picture to appear correct. About 20 minutes on call waiting for someone to speak but 20 seconds to fix.I knew before the purchase that the 750 tends to have more reflection from lamps and windows than the 650 but for $50 difference in price it was a no-brainer to decide. The 750 has better speakers and more bells ( Anynet, Flash Memory, DCM, DLNA and Wiselink Pro (MPEG support)). If reflections are issues then turn the lights off and close the blinds or if you don't need the computer connections and better speakers then go with the 650.

Standard def programs and DVD's will be around for a number of years, even when the switch to digital happens many stations will still be in 480i.My only beef with the TV is the software used to connect to a PC (and thus picture and music files). The software isn't very user friendly and limited to specific types of file names. As well, there isn't a setting to shuffle play pictures and have background music at the same time.

I was called about 2 days before expected delivery by a company who has delivered TV's of this size and larger many times judging from their skill to bring it in my house and up flights of stairs with gloves without banging stuff. They set it up on my stand with the slideshow already on the tv and made sure everything was correct from the factory and I signed the papers and was astonished at what I saw and expected.  This TV looks like a lamborghini for a TV, the bezel really brings out the aesthetics of what you're in for. Though I heard the 850 series was coming out the price simply can't touch the 750 series and I am deeply happy with this model.Before buying this TV I was deeply persuaded by it's review on Audioholics.com. They are a group of sound/video engineers who are big audio/videophiles on the side and and do non-biased reviews and instruction from do-it-yourself projects to hometheater, multimedia and stereo products. SO after reading the article on this TV it was confirmed it was almost perfectly calibrated out of the box by two steps in the menus, which should be set for every source you have assigned:Picture mode: change to MOVIE MODEDetailed setting in the picture menu: Change to auto (however, I had auto 1 and 2, I picked 1)Even after using my datavision datacolor calibration package, it gave me the same settings, but this package can only do your 5 basic settings and not grey levels. However, I can assure you they are quite close by my previous experiences. Nonetheless, like the review had said, I couldn't believe how amazing this looked and made me watch every movie I owned in a new way. Everything is so fluid and detailed, I truly commend Samsung. I haven't gotten into all the extras, like anynet and the wiselink stuff, but I'd still buy this tv without any of that, and it does seem to be a little confusing, you might as well stick with a media center application through xbox 360 and your computer if your trying to use this tv as a screen.Again, I have seen many tv's, most of which people will never calibrate, much less have the ability to do it in 2 steps out of the box. I highly recommend this tv and don't be worried about the bezel prob's people have been saying, or the remote being undesirable, that is the least of my worries if it has the basics. The only rant I have is the PIP option that for some reason works only in specific situations.

I bought it on sale for $2649, which was a steal at the time when the MSRP was $3499.  This TV was just one of the items that I purchased that day for my home theater (see my reviews for the other items).I'd been holding off buying a new TV for a number of factors.  Primarily, I'm a practical spender, and have difficulty spending big money on electronics (cell phones, iPods, computers, receivers, DVD players, TVs, etc.), since technology is constantly changing and improving.  In addition, I had a 30\" Samsung tube TV that I purchased in '03.  It was 1080i and had absolutely zero electronic or picture problems with it.  That said, the TV was relatively small to fully enjoy high-def movies and programming.  So, based on already happily owning a Samsung TV, I decided to stick with the brand.So I purchased this TV, brought it home, and set it up with the rest of the home theater components (see the rest of my reviews for a full list of the goodies!).  A few HDMI and component connections later, I turned on the TV and \"voila!\" I was absolutely blown away by the clarity and the bright colors on the screen that came to life in my living room!The stock picture setting is great, but for the next hour or so, I tinkered with the different picture settings, adjusting basic options like color & brightness, and more advanced features that this TV has, like AutoMotion Plus that juices this TV up to full 120Hz refresh rate.  To see the difference, the TV goes into a \"demo\" mode - splitting the screen so that on one side, you see the current program you're watching WITHOUT 120Hz refresh, and the other half shows you the same program WITH 120Hz refresh, and the difference and improvement is night and day.The seating arrangement in our living room makes the viewing distance from screen to seat approximately 10 feet.  At that distance, this screen is neither too large nor too small for our room and for our eyes.  We decided not to place this TV on a wall mount, even though this TV can be mounted on the wall.  The TV stand that comes with this TV is very sturdy and compliments the bezel and overall design of this TV.I rarely use the remote control, so I hardly ever take advantage of this TV's special features, like picture-in-picture or the built-in hard drive, which features such items like the art displays, recipes, games, etc.  The DLNA was a bit difficult to set up, though I only tried it with a wireless Internet router for a buddy's Xbox that I borrowed.  Once set up, though, the functionality was pretty cool - I was able to check the latest news and weather blurbs whenever I chose to view them (seemed like a RSS feed or something).  I promptly disconnected the router because it didn't look too good next to the TV and sitting plainly on the TV stand.The only negative I have about this TV is how easily the bezel and the TV stand scratch, even using the softest microfiber and softest diaper cloth.  Granted the scratches are more visible to just my eye, and none of our guests has ever mentioned anything about them, but I'm just a bit picky when it comes to minimizing microscratches on the things I own (car's paint job, plastic items, PS3 exterior, humidor's finish, etc,).Overall, this TV is an excellent buy.  My wife and I have enjoyed watching Blu-Ray DVDs and HD programming on this TV for the last three months.  It's a perfect television for with the best picture quality and contemporary design for the price.

No one button to cycle input devices or cycle AMP (some stuff it's good with, some stuff it's not) or cycle through picture dispay (16:9, 4:3, etc...).One other drawback -- expect to become a HD snob after having this with a hi def signal for any amount of time.  :)  It's really like night and day.

CEVA logistics (the new UPS for Amazon)calls your contact phone (the one listed on amazon billing profile) and schedules an appointment for delivery. They deliver to specific areas in a city only on certain days of the week. They did a good job of removing TV from packing, inspecting for physical defects, placing it on the stand, powering up, checking for sound to ensure that the speakers are working properly and get an offical sign-off on the checklist.. thorough and impressive work, I would say.Now about the TV:What I liked: Amazing picture quality, superb in-built speakers, enough settings to customize all types of configurationWhat I did not like:1) PIP (Picture-in-picture) feature is a waste.. it does not allow you to swap between 2 channels (it has to be from 2 different signal sources - like DVD and TV, and TV channel ideally becomes the small picture). How to use this feature: you will have to bypass the Digital / HD box (from service provider) and directly hook up cable to your TV to use the in-built tuner2) Infolink: this feature gets RSS feed and runs a marquee on your TV screen. To use this feature, you MUST buy a wireless adapter from SAMSUNG.. I tried with a Netgear wireless adapter. It did not work, because there is no hardware - like a CD drive or other support to install the drivers. Samsung adapter comes with pre-loaded drivers and compatibility to work with the TV.

The other 32\" LCD was also 720p however I sold it a couple years ago just because I needed the money more than the tv. Anyway, I have yet to watch anything 1080p on this television. I can only imagine what that will look like. Already, watching movies is almost surreal. My friends and family all say the same thing. Even playing standard dvd's the picture is so clear that it's almost as if I was watching a home video or documentary. There is no graininess that you usually have with films. The sound is ok but I usually use my surround system so I have no opinion on it. The one thing that I would criticize is the rotating disc on the remote. It feels flimsy and it is slow to respond on screen when making menu choices. I would much rather have an \"Ipod\" rotating wheel/disc.

First if you are watching a letter box movie the halo effect doesn't occur because of the black bars on top and bottom. Second if you are watching a full screen version and the halo effect bothers you, you have two options as I see it. One slightly back light the tv to offset(this works great) or two go to a framing or arts and craft store and buy the thin black tape they put around frames of art and apply to the tv.

I got it down between the Sony W series and the Samsung 6 and 7 series 52 inchers.All 3 TV's have incredible picture quality.  Can't go wrong with either Samsung or Sony.  For myself it came down to cabinet appearance.  I know, seems insignificant, but it matters to some.  The Sony has that silver speaker bar along the bottom that I find unattractive.  I like the way the Samsungs look.  Granted they have that \"touch of color\" reddish hue to the bezel, for the most part it looks black.They both offered similar feature sets.  I believe the 7 series added some audio benefits over the 6 series.  I believe the speakers on the 7 series are upgraded over the 6 series.  I also like the square stand it sits on rather than the oval one the 6 series has.  Furthermore, the price difference between the 6 and the 7 at times was only $50, so why not go for the higher model!As far as picture quality goes, its really incredible on HD sources.  Directv and blu ray are pretty unbelievable.  Striking and vivid colors, no artifacts on the screen so far, so the 120Hz must be doing its job.

No matter how carefully you try to protect the plastic, any attempt to dust or clean the bezel results in fine scratches and eventually a white haze. What's worse, any lights in the room catch the hazy scratches and cause horrible, glaring reflections. I called Samsung technical support twice about this problem, and all they said was \"we don't warrant against physical damage.\"It's a shame, because the quality of the picture is very good. But you can't watch the picture because your view is constantly distracted by the glare from the bezel.My advice is to spend your money on an LCD with a more traditional metal or solid black frame.", "Date": "August 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great product from Samsung, Bad delivery from vendor (AMAZON)", "Author": "070", "ReviewID": "R3CROETV4N93BT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with this LCD TV.

Basically only a pre-listed set of mac addresses (unique addresses given to network cards). There is apparently no way to obtain the mac address of the NIC (network interface card) within the Samsung tv.

A second call got a different tech support person and I was told that there has to be some lighting behind the set to see the red color.  Since our's is in an entertainment center it doesn't have any light behind it.Using a flashlight to provide some light shows that the color is there.
