I bought this TV about a year, maybe a year and a half ago. I got it at Walmart for $211 as my first LCD TV and have never had a problem with it. I use it mostly for watching movies on my Playstation2 and 3, and as a PC monitor, and it works great for all three purposes. It has an easy to use on-screen menu, and lets you change quite a few settings to get the best picture. I do have to switch to a \"darker\" setting to use it as a PC monitor, or the screen will be a little blurry. Not a big deal.The only thing it doesn't have, and I really wish it did, is some sort of audio output, to let me redirect sound from the TV to external speakers. The built-in speakers do the job very well, though not much bass in it since the speakers are small. :)I don't use this TV in a large room. It might be hard to see if I did. It sits on a table next to my computer, maybe 3 feet away from me, and works great for that.If you're living on a budget, and don't need a TV that fills up an entire wall, this's perfect! :)", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Sam Shenenberger", "ReviewID": "R2M45Y9HRGSHDG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok so mixed reviews and all I ordered this tv and I'm not sure what some of the reviewers were talking about I have 2 hdmi ports and audio out now granted its a head phone jack but who cares go to RadioShack and buy a converter if you must orrrr but pretty much and single speaker cuz most come mp3 capable and then all you need is one cord so ya inlove the tv works fine didn't come with a remote but I ordered one off here that was made for the tv so ill update when it comes in", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Emerson 22in.
