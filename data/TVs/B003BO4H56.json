{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect for me, but with some flashlighting", "Author": "Marty Gillis", "ReviewID": "R2XA4BN6LOER86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for the LG 47LE5400 47-Inch Edge Lit LED/LCD 1080p HDTV! (what a mouthful!) This is a new model and Amazons date for \"first available is wrong.After much comparison, and  much online and in-store research I decided to plunk down my hard earned cash on this bad boy.  So far, I am very glad I did.My criteria for purchase was a screen no larger than 47 inches (to preserve the image quality of my AVI files and SD programming) and also something that had perfect geometry (unlike the Mitsubishi DLP that recently died on me) and something that would display and maintain a bright uniform picture. (unlike my Pioneer Plasma did) I also had hoped for a display that could display a 50hz PAL video signal as long as it was first upconverted to 720p or higher.  (The LG will NOT display a 576 line image , but will take that image if upconverted , even while remaining 50hz so no format conversion is required for motion correctness, just upconversion to 720p / 1080i or 1080p)Purchased the set at a brick and mortar location (initials are BB) so in case things didn't work out I could  return or exchange it with no problems.  I easily carried the box inside my house (I am pushing 60 with arthritis) and had the stand assembled and mounted on the TV in about 20 minutes total from bringing in the box. The  TV is packed well, but not filled with unnecessary packaging material.  There is a quick start guide included and the entire manual resides on a CD-Rom which I personally HATE but at least you can't spill things on it right? Also included were warranty materials, a separate set of instructions and CD-ROM for the web connectivity stuff , some cable adapters, a cleaning cloth and the remote with two AAA batteries.The TV was in perfect condition, wrapped in that foam cloth stuff and with the prerequisite plastic film over the frame bezel.  Easy to remove all of that stuff and it didn't leave any trace of sticky residue which was nice.  Jacks are group on the rear left with the USB and headphone jacks on the left side but behind the bezel.  This TV is very thin and not all that secure on it's stand.  The stand is fine, but I would recommend strapping it down whenever you put it unless you use a wall mount of some kind. Just sitting on a table you are one false move away from turning your beautiful LED TV into a doorstop. And the TV itself is very nice to look at, very easy on the eyes really.I am not currently using the web connectivity stuff or the Netflix online feature so I can not comment on those functions in this review.  If they work as well as the rest of the unit, things should be fine.  While it is 'internet ready' it does not include a wireless dongle so you either need to physically connect it to your router with an Ethernet cable, or purchase a USB wireless dongle from LG . (Yes, they are proprietary, unfortunately) Connected my HDMI cables from my Fios DVR and Oppo Blu Ray and plugged in the power. This TV will power up and ask you if you want 'home use' or \"store use' which is of course flame thrower mode.  Pick  'home use' and go from there.  Just remember which inputs you plugged what into so you can easily get to them.  The manual will tell you how to custom label your inputs if you can't remember HDMI 1 or 2 or so forth.The first thing I did was set the picture to \"Standard\" and then lower the back light, the contrast, the brightness and color and even sharpness levels.  Then I went into the advanced settings menu and turned off all the noise reduction and cut the auto contrast setting down to low.  The TV will not look all that great out of the box as it is meant to attract your attention in the store, but those setting are pretty useless at home if you want your picture to look rich and natural.  All in all, it took me maybe 15 minutes to get a starting point where I could watch and be more than happy with the picture.You can download the manual from LG's website and get to know this unit before you purchase. That's what I did and it saved me tons of time. LG also includes a 'Picture Wizard' that helps you to easily and quickly calibrate an input to your taste and achieve fairly accurate color and proper contrast and brightness.  You can then assign that setting to any input or inputs you wish and save it .  You can do this twice and save each one with the 'Expert' function and of course you can adjust the other preset picture modes and save them as well. LOTS of options in that regard!A word about the 120Hz True Motion.  Like hot sauce, a little goes a long way. LG offers you your choice of ON, OFF, LOW, HIGH and USER.  In the user mode you can adjust both judder AND motion blur separately which is a big improvement in software for this model I think.  To me, the True Motion gives you almost the same effect as watching a video tape rather than a film.  It does lend itself to some program material, making certain things appear even more real, a sort of hyper reality.  It does introduce some other artifacts into the picture quality that you may or may not notice and ultimately you may decide not to use it at all.  The good news is, it can be switched off but also adjusted to suit your needs and personal taste.  Does it completely eliminate motion blur? Not by a long shot!  For now, motion blur is something that is inherent in LCD displays.  Maybe someday they will find a way to get them to switch on and off quicker (the pixels) and perhaps start putting some beefier processing chips into these things as well.  As it is, on very rare occasions the display seems to 'skip a beat' and the chip seems to be temporarily overloaded. It all happens in a blink of an eye and is over before it started, but it DOES happen.The dreaded lip sync issue that you may have heard about regarding LG has happened to me once so far after changing channels on my DVR.  I had to shut off the display and reboot and it went away the first time.  I plan to update the firmware as soon as I connect to my Cable router and hopefully it will be a thing of the past.  I have used it heavily for more than a week and it has only happened once so far.My BIGGEST criteria for selecting my new TV was it's ability to play PAL DVD video with no conversion.  I have a very large collection of British and European DVD's and am not happy with 'converting' them to NTSC even with my Oppo.  By making some sense out of the LG specs I had guessed it might be able to display PAL properly with no format (50 to 60hz) conversion, resulting in a much better picture than standard DVD could ever provide. IT WORKS PEREFCTLY! (but you MUST first upconvert it to 720p or 1080i or 1080p for the LG to be able to display it.  Any upconverting DVD player can accomplish that for you!)  So far, only my Pioneer Plasma could display PAL without conversion so this was a huge plus for me. My Babylon 5 PAL DVD's look VERY close to HD and a real revelation, not to mention my LOTR Extended Editions in glorious PAL!!  Also, standard NTSC DVD video is quite good, depending on your player and source material and off the air (or off Fios in my case) SD material looks very good.  And it goes without saying that Blu Ray or HD DVD material will simply blow you away once the set is even basically calibrated.By the end of the day I had both my DVR and Blu Ray inputs calibrated to my liking and I must say the overall picture quality is nothing short of excellent.  Sounds is 'ok' , not too awful, but not good enough to satisfy a movie lover.  (hook up to a surround system and you will be glad you did)So far, I have just ONE complaint and for many people this is a big one. In a word, FLASHLIGHTING !This is when the LED's which illuminate the LCD pixels shine through the edges of the picture and make there way in to dark areas on your screen, such as night time, or a fade out . During any other time the picture is outstanding, but no matter how low I set the back light (within reason) you can  easily see it during any dark scnes.  I personally have chosen to ignore this problem and just enjoy the TV.You will not notice the flashlighting problem in the store. They make sure and supply program material that never goes dark on the edges so any deficiencies in contrast or flashlighting are hidden from the consumer.  Bring your own USB drive with a movie that features a lot of dark scenes, the new Harry Potter comes to mind, and you will see for yourself. That's of course if they let you do that! I had also considered the Vizio 47 inch LED LCD set for about the same price and IT features local dimming on the LED array which eliminates this flashlighting problem.  I just don't feel comfortable yet with Vizio as a brand and opted for the LG.  Videophiles would think I am nuts, but there you have it!  Neither Vizio nor the king of local dimming LED, Samsung ,can display native PAL video.  I feel I made the right choice for me anyway.This TV really provides you with a HUGE wealth of signal processing tools (adjustments) to shape your picture quality any way you want it to be.  There are 2 expert modes that let you tweak and calibrate to your hearts content, and not even my Pio Kuro had this amount of control over it.  Honestly, except for the flashlighting problem I am totally happy with this LG.  Honestly, I can live with it, but many could not.  I would say the average person would rarely, if ever notice it , but it IS there and as such a deal breaker for many would be buyers.With that said, This TV seems to be well made with a good solid build quality, the remote is much better than most (although I just use a Harmony One for everything) and it does everything I want it to do and more.  Now lets see if the thing holds up to heavy use.  As a parting thought I would recommend going with some form of extended warranty. Either thru the place of purchase or perhaps a company like Square Trade would be good as they allow you to purchase your extended warranty any time during the original warranty of your product.  HAPPY TV SHOPPING!UPDATE 5/30/10 :  After 3 weeks of using this TV, and taking the time to properly calibrate the inputs  (using Digital Video essentials and THX Optimizer) I have come to some conclusions......The 5400 performs VERY well for SD sources, both AVI based , Standard DVD and SD cable channels.  (subject to whatever compression our cable company or DVD manufacturer has added) Xvid encoded files rate very good to almost HD in appearance. Really nice!  The vertical banding is only visible during extremely WHITE based scenes with side to side camera pans.  It is bothersome at times, but I am choosing to ignore it in favor of this sets strong points.  I continue to be amazed by the quality off unconverted Pal DVD playback on this thing.  My Fios premium channels have taken on an almost 3D quality and I sometimes find myself just staring at this thing in wonder and shaking my head in disbelief at times. No kidding! .  If you spent another thousand or so on a top local dimming Samsung you could do better, otherwise I feel this TV is a winner and I still have NO buyers remorse.  I put my new Mitsubishi  DLP (newly repaired) in my walk-in closet in case of disaster striking the LG.  I see the USB wireless adapter is finally available so I will be ordering that next month and checking out the Netflix performance and other widgets and content providers.UPDATE 6-14-10  Finally got around to connecting to the net with this thing. It was very easy. I just plugged in an Ethernet cable from my router and it instantly set itself up with no help from me.  Went about programming the Yahoo Widgets next and while it was a bit painstaking, it worked fine.  Set up my You Tube account as well and after signing in (and telling it to stay signed in) it works like a charm.  Netflix will be next in just 2 weeks, but for now it all looks and works great.  I have a fast net connection so I don't foresee any trouble with Netlfix, even the HD content.  My final update will be posted after checking out Netflix performance..... Stay Tuned....FINAL UPDATE 6-16-10OK, I can give a good report on the Network capabilities and user interface .  Right now I am connected to my computer and extra hard drives on a wireless LAN set up in my media room.  I have the LG connected directly to my router via the Ethernet connection.  (didn't want to chance the bandwidth with their wireless dongle)  I am running a very inexpensive Compaq (under 300 bucks new) and using Nero Media Home 4 as my server software even though Windows 7 includes such software of their own.  The LG is optimized for the Nero program and the basic version is included with your TV purchase from LG.  I set up my computer for Network sharing and let er rip!How does it work? IN a word............. G R E A T !!!  So fa the LG can hand ALL formats I have thrown at it.  It outperforms (by miles) an Asus O'Play and even the USB playback of my Oppo BDP-80.  I am getting flawless playback, even on HD files of large size and bitrates.  The user interface is nice. There are many options and it is intuitive.  The software on the LG even remembers your place if you stop a file and wish to resume later.  It is very well thought out for an added extra.  With this modest system I have in place, it is like having my very own on demand channel that only plays the stuff I love!  I really can't say enough good things about the performance.  It is truly great and so much nicer than the little standalone media players on the market right now.So after almost a month now, I totally LOVE this TV !!  Honestly, I am not all that hip about computers and networks and i got it to work within a few hours and beyond any of my expectations.  Just plugging in a USB hard drive or thumb drive to the TV jacks and bypassing networking would be simple as can be and yield the same excellent results.  And this is just a bonus feature. WOW!  I am SO glad I bought this TV and hope other folks with similar needs will try this out and see for themselves.  I am SOLD on LG for now!", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV - Very satisfied", "Author": "MonkTheKing \"MonkTheKing\"", "ReviewID": "RJDF4102FF0SV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the LG LE475400 set up in my living room for about a week now. I have a PS3, Xbox 360, surround sound receiver, and my HD cable box attached. With 4 HDMI slots, I was able to connect all of them with HDMI wires. Out of the box, the picture is pretty lame. Be prepared to spend roughly 10 - 15 minutes per input slot setting up your preferred options. Please note that for some reason the \"Real Cinema\" option is only available to me on certain HDMI slots - i wonder if it has anything to do with the connected equipment or not. Another interesting setting is the \"Tru Motion\" option  - turn this to high if you like to have that \"soap opera\" feel to your video. I have to say, it looks very natural but i prefer to keep this option off as a matter of taste. I'm sure some people will love it. Besides those two options, you have the standard \"Contrast\", \"Sharpness\", etc,etc options as well. You could even control specific color settings - ie - Blue brightness, Red brightness, etc etc. Loads of tweaking options here. You could literally spend hours on each input if you're obsessive enough.After I completed all my tweaks for each input i have to say i'm very impressed with this TV. I probably sit a little too close to the TV than I should (I bought this TV for my next apt which will be bigger) and even with that being the case it looks great. As with all LCD's you will see some motion distortion but I think LG has a done a great job limiting this (especially if you turn off Tru Motion).Now granted the only movies I've watched on it so far are HD cable programs (like HD HBO) so I can't comment on how Blu Ray movies would play (getting Avatar Blu Ray this coming Saturday to test it!!)Where I see a huge improvement in this TV over my now defunct Samsung 40\" LCD (720p)is in video game graphics and visuals. I mean, this TV is perfect for gaming. It's almost as if this TV has given some of my games a new lease on life. I can't stress enough how amazing my games look and play on this TV. Again, I had to spend a bit of time tweaking the settings to my liking but I'm sure any die hard gamer or videophile would find settings that suit their taste. Just a phenomenal gaming TV.From a physical design perspective you could probably find something more attractive. The bezel is as plain as it gets with a very \"no frills\" design. Also, before I wall mounted this TV I noticed it to be a bit wobbly on the stand. This could have been due to me not attaching the stand securely enough but I thought I did a solid job.The best part of the design is how thin it is - I'm talking Kate Moss thin. I really love how thin it is. It's just such a nice look.Oh, and the power cord for some reason feels exceptionally short compared to other LCDs I've owned.Compared to what I've paid in the past for LCDs, this TV is wonderful. If you're in the market for a 47\" LCD definitely give this one a look.", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV, great price~!", "Author": "CT", "ReviewID": "R3JVNTAZO2X3VQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior to this TV we had a 40' Sony XBR2 LED which I love and was moved to the bedroom with this purchase. After reading reviews and taking stock of the features of this TV I decided to take the plunge and get the LG. I had purchased an LG monitor last year and loved it, and this TV lives up to that purchase. The picture is incredible first off. I went in to Best Buy and compared it to all the high-end models, and this one held it's own against Samsung's and Sony's, for half the price. It looks like the price has gone up a bit here since I purchased it, but that's because they sold out thru amazon and are being sold by another vendor here.I loved the connectivity features of this TV. It had netflix streaming, vuduo and widgets. It has plenty of HDMI ports. One thing I did NOT like was that it only has an optical out. I fixed this problem by purchasing a Gefen Gtv-digaud-2aaud Digital-to-analog Audio Adapterwhich works perfectly. I simply connected the optical to this from TV, then stereo cables to my surround system. Problem solved. I also didn't like that it didn't have an S-video cable. I solved this by getting Pyle Home PCVHDM49 Composite Video and S-Video to HDMI Converter which works great when I connect my old videogame systems to it. I got mine in an Amazon promotion that included LG AN-WL100W Wireless Media Kit, which I was skeptical about. It actually works great, with one caveat: you cannot have a 5ghz router nearby, as it seems to interfere with the signal. Also, If you have a Logitech Harmony one remote this Tv has all kinds of problems switching inputs. It's a long story but suffice to say myself and logitech tech support couldn't get it to work.I love the video quality with blu-ray, and the 24hz with blu ray works great. All in all I would def recommend this, especially for those who are looking for a good value.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good LED-LCD, but plasma is better", "Author": "Thomas Sage", "ReviewID": "R1746N6HVR607I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the 47LE5400 during a killer sale on Amazon, got it for a great price, and was excited when it was delivered. My previous set was a 720p plasma and I had heard that the new LED-LCDs were far superior.Unfortunately, I didn't have the TV on for more than 1 minute before noticing problems. Some call it flashlighting, some call it clouding, but it is basically an effect where some of the LCD backlighting bleeds through black images around the edges. Since I like to watch a lot of widescreen movies, it was very annoying to have uneven blacks at the top and bottom of the screen. Perhaps this isn't an issue with local-dimming LCDs, but it IS an issue with this TV. By the way -- this is a problem you will never be able to see in the store. You have to be in a dark room to see it.If you are watching full-screen sports or high-def channels, you wouldn't notice the flashlighting effect. In fact, the picture is GORGEOUS for video games and sports. But when you are watching TV in a dimly lit room and a lot of black comes on the screen, you will notice it. After paying this much for a TV I just didn't want to put up with it. I returned the TV to Amazon and got a Panasonic 1080p plasma instead (TC-P42G25). The stark difference blew me away and made me wonder why anyone buys LCD TVs in the first place. The colors were just as bright and the blacks were much deeper with zero flashlighting.Basically, this LG TV is fine for watching full screen TV but may be insufficient if you want smooth, deep blacks.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG 47LE5400 47 Inch LED", "Author": "ledguru", "ReviewID": "R14TGF9G4KL4JX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this item and I have had it now for about a month.  The set is absolutly insane.  I have shopped around for a few months before finally pulling the trigger and ordering this set.  I went to walmart, best buy, sams club, costco, target, local tv businesses, ect, searching for the best LED.  Since I was going to be spending over 1000 dollars I wanted to make sure that I got a great tv.  I knew immediatly that this was the set that I wanted after seeing this TV in the store for myself.  Usually I can see a little bit of a difference between tv sets but this one was different.  As soon as I seen it you could tell there was a HUGE difference.  After that I just waited till there was a good price for it.  I ended up getting it from amazon with a free bluray home theatre system.Since getting it we have loved it.  Right away, the bluray movies didn't look that great, but then I just adjusted the picture settings(sharpness was turned all the way up) and that made a huge difference.  The other thing I would like to point out about this set is that the regular non-HDTV channels look good.  I have seen some LCD tvs on regular tv and it looks horribly distorted. I also have a PS3 hooked up to it and that looks amazing as well, no problems of anysort there.This truely is a great set.

Very limited network app selection, but what's there operates well.  Somewhat heavy and think-framed.  Snobs will balk at edge-light bleeding.I researched this LG model carefully against Samsung models UNxxC6300/6500.  While Samsung offers models with and without network apps, LG has a single model with a limited app selection (mainly netflix, vudu, youtube-- notably missing Amazon VOD, Pandora).  However note you can find the LG at about the same price as Samsung's bare-bones model, so consider LG's apps as a free feature.  The LG's Netflix and Vudu apps have good interfaces and stream well.  I was quite happy with Vudu's lower-cost SD and HD modes-- HDX is not worth the premium.  (Are you gonna stare at the pixels or watch the movie?)I've got to give high marks to the LG's matte display.  For comparison I'm now trying out a Sony internet TV and the surface is like a pane of glass and reflects everything.  I don't know why people obsess about edge-light bleeding (the LG has this artifact) and \"blackness\" while being fine with every light source in your room reflecting off the TV, obscuring the video and giving you a headache.While roughly just as thin, the LG 47\" unit is about 10 lbs heavier than Samsung's 46\".  It has a few more inches in width and height too, but you do get an extra 1\" of display.One audio gripe-- the LG will not pass original audio format received from external HDMI devices through its optical output (i.e. your DVD player Dolby audio will get degraded to stereo unless you link the player to your audio system directly).  From what I've read most TV's have this flaw.  However clearly they can do better-- for example the Sony I'm trying now will pass through the original audio format as long as you disable the TV's internal stereo speakers.Overall I'd recommend this TV assuming you hunt around for a good price and don't need a large selection of built-in internet apps.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture", "Author": "W.

From the second I turned it on, I was like OMG!  The picture is so incredible!  The base seems a little flimsy, but I'm going to put it on a wall mount in a few days.  It's got plenty of HDMI and USB inputs.  Since I don't know much about HDTVs I won't go into any details other than the picture is absolutely amazing.  After running the picture wizard I was blown away.  The firmware updates itself so you're always running the latest greatest version.  The netflix and vudu (I haven't used vudu before) are nice.  Very easy to set up and enjoy.  I would defintely buy one of these for every room in the house if I had a winning lottery ticket :)  I'm very pleased with this TV.One thing I noticed though.  When I first set it up and was watching my first program (just checking out the picture, ect..).  After a few minutes, I heard a 'tick' sound (like a button being pressed on the tv bezel).  And a box came up and said \"This function is not available now\".  Took the batteries out of the remote so make sure a button wasn't stuck, that wasn't the problem.  I got into the main menu, and it's acting like the 'UP' button in being pressed repeatedly for no reason.  It seems others are having this problem with LG TV's, not just this model.  I just filled out my warranty registration card online and emailed LG about it.  I'm not happy about it.  I'll edit this review when I hear back from LG.*************I haven't heard back from LG yet, but I've found recomendations for when this happens to unplug the TV, hold the power button on the remote in while plugging the TV back in.  I did this and so far the problem has not come back.  I hope it never does.  Oh, and it looks awesome on my wall mount :)*************The problem of the \"This function is not available now\" came back.

I'll see if the repair will work first.  The tech said he's going to replaced the logic board.*************LG technician came to my house and replaced the logic board and so far, it's been working great.  Kind of amazing since the repair tech didn't use any ESD protection at all (i.e. laid the circuit board on my carpet and on his lap while it was out).  Didn't take off his shoes either.  Oh well, it's working great now!************Worked great for two days.  The \"This function is not available now\" box came back up.  I'll update this review again I'm sure...Do yourself a favor and don't buy this or any LG TVs.************LG sending another tech out this coming Monday.  I'll let you know if it solves my problem. [...].************The tech called on Monday, after 5:00 which was past the time he was supposed to be at my house.  Said he didn't have the part he wanted to repalce (the front bezel that contains the front keypad and IR remote sensor).  Said it would take around a week to get.  I hope I don't get fired for having to take off work so much to get my POS TV fixed.************The front bezel finally came in and the tech replaced it.

When the picture blacks out it's just a medium grey, and throws enough ambient light around the front of the room to read a book.  I have adjusted the levels many times, with the backlight and brightness set very low.  Either this particular unit is broken or it is meant solely for watching in very brightly lit room.  The edge of the picture was also clipped off on the left.  With the settings at normal for 16x9 sets, this unit stretched standard 16x9 so everything looked short and fat, no setting would correct for that.For what I paid I expect the screen to go to real black and not something bright enough to read by.  Anyone know how common this is?  When I read about \"flashlighting\" I expected a few halos or sparkles around movie credits or the very edges of the screen. This is the whole screen being lit up...  Lip synch issues almost all the time.Update 11/22.  Amazon was initially pretty good about offering a replacement.  However it was delayed an extra week because \"Pilot\" carriers were hard to reach, and refused to deliver or even talk to me except during their very limited weekday hours (when I'm at work).Many more phone calls...  this \"Pilot\" carrier keeps calling then won't talk to me when I call back.  A repair service for LG contacted me, asked a few questions, and said it was likely the problem is the LCD screen itself.11/30 Update - Amazon's \"white glove\" delivery was more of a \"dirty glove\" service as the \"Pilot\" carriers, who arrived at my door without notice were dressed more like garbage men, and left dirty fingerprints all over the bezel and screen.  The box arrived looking like it had been dragged or tossed around, and had a hole ripped big enough to put a whole arm into it, and the carriers wanted the original box to take the first set back in.  Seeing the damage, I said no.  They wanted me to sign a paper saying the TV was fine before I could see anything more than snow on it.  Signed just to get them out of my house.Replacement set is MUCH WORSE.  Where the first one was uniformly washed-out, this one is all smeary and cloudy so you will never see a screen that is all one solid shade or color.The \"deep black\" claimed in the the sales pitch on the product page here is nowhere in evidence, the \"Cinema Mode\" makes everything look yellow and dim, the \"auto picture\" feature dims the picture to unwatchable levels, the motion feature makes human movement look mechanical, even when turned off.Update 12/10 This whole experience has been a nightmare.  LG's customer service has been pretty much useless, the reps sound like they're in grade school in another country.  I've even e-mailed their head of Marketing and development, who has ignored three messages.Update 12/15 - one month after placing order - The set is Definitely NOT recommended, nor is Amazon's frustratingly sloppy delivery system.

It has a great picture, and the internet (Netflix) works well with the separate USB piece LG makes and sells.I'm sending it back for a specific reason that may not affect many customers, but was infuriating for me.  I am moving from the US to the UK in July.  I wanted to get a nice 46 or 47 inch LED TV before leaving to take with me, and did a lot of research.  Going to stores, I learned that LG was the one brand that seemed to offer TVs that accept both 110V and 240V.  I confirmed that on the LG USA website, for this particular model (LG 47LE5400).  The tech spec sheet clearly stated Power 110V-240V.  So I ordered that exact model, using Amazon.  It came from Electronics Expo.After setting it up in my home (to use between now and July), the next morning I happened to check the label on the back of the TV - and it says 110V only!  At that point, I realized I needed either a replacement with the full voltage capability or a full refund (including the shipping costs), otherwise I'd be taking an expensive doorstop to the UK.A call to Electronics Expo led them to say it wasn't their fault (\"we sell what LG sends us\"), and while they offered to take the TV back, their position was I would have to eat the shipping charges.  They did investigate with LG, and they called me back to suggest I talk to LG directly.  (I should point out I felt the EE position was reasonable, so no beef against them.)My call with LG was far from satisfying.  The customer rep first suggested the TV would work in the UK (in spite of what voltage was stated on the label); she would not authorize payment of the shipping charges.  I had visions of getting to the UK, plugging it in and hearing it go \"poof.\"  I asked to speak with her supervisor, who had a different story but with the same outcome.  The supervisor told me LG would not guarantee the TV would work in the UK (not surprising!).  I pointed out that I was only asking for a guarantee of the 240V capability stated on their own website.  Her response then moved on to \"the fine print says technical specifications can change without prior notification.\"  I asked her if she was willing to alienate a customer for the roughly $200 in shipping charges that was in question.  Apparently she was, because she repeated that LG would not cover those shipping charges.  Then she asked if I wanted to make a complaint, but told me in advance that it would not change the outcome!  (\"The complaint will be looked at internally to see if we should make any changes, but the decision I am giving you is final.\")So today I am packing up the TV to send back to Electronics Expo (and the internet dongle back to Amazon).

XBox360 looks amazing with the HDMI 1.3 version cable, which is key for all the HD; if you want 1080p you have to have the 1.3.  Next I plan to get a decent sound system.  This tv's sound is definately just tv speakers.  Love this thing.  Too bad I didn't wait and get $300 off.  Wait...I got it a BB and got a top of the line XBox and Black Ops for free....", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible picture for a value price", "Author": "Doug Sundqust", "ReviewID": "R3RUHJVPNNEBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research and settled on this TV and would have bought online if I hadn't found a local premium dealer that had it on sale at a similar price.  The picture is amazing and brings what you're watching to life.  I was concerned about the flashlight effect I've read about in some reviews and I discussed it with the dealer. Honestly, if its a problem its subtle and you have to look for it.  There is nothing that's bothered me in the least watching any kind of video source.  Standard def video looks much better than my previous 37\" LCD TV - I was very worried about that with this larger size but its great.  There was a review I read that suggested there was no audio out control for your sound system - not sure what that was all about but I've connected it with the optical output and it's great.  You can also use that simultaneously with the TV speakers if you choose to (not sure why you'd want to but you can).  I don't care so much about the online features (I have a Blu-Ray player with that) so haven't tested any of that, I bought this for the picture and it is truly amazing.  I was simply shopping for a larger LCD and wasn't even considering the LED backlighting, I didn't think I needed/wanted it and wasn't going to pay for it.  Am I glad I changed my mind on that, the LED backlighting is what brings the picture to life and is well worth it.  This is my 3rd LG LCD and I'm very happy with them all.

The complex wireless connections were a breeze to set-up, thanks to the built-in capabilities of this LG model and very clear instructions.  Every thing is working well.  Picture quality is superb.  Delivery was precisely when promised, everything needed was in the box, instructions for assembly were clear, and we are very much enjoying HD TV for our first time.  The sound volume needed a bit of tinkering to automatically equalize properly for TV and for Netflix as streaming video, but this adjustment (like most others) is menu driven on the LG, and a bit of experimentation with checking and unchecking boxes on the menu quickly fixed the uneven sound levels.

I first tried to play in on a PS2 and there was a noticeable delay between when you step on the mat and matching the arrows on the screen. We thought it might be a problem with the game. So my sister tried the same game on her PS2 on a different TV and it worked fine. So then we assumed that there was something wrong with the PS2. It didn't occur to us that there might be an issue with the TV.We just bought a Wii and bought a new DDR game for the Wii. It has the exact same problem. The Wii, the game, and the mat are all brand new and it has the same problem as the game on the PS2. I did a little more research about this model and found other people having the same issues with this TV.I called LG to ask about this issue and was treated like crap by one of their customer service reps. He told me that there was no issue with the TV and that it was the video game that had a problem. This was after I explained to him that we tried two different games, on two different systems, and had the same problems with both. We also tried the same systems and same games on a different TV and they worked fine. So, no the problem is not with the games. I asked him to speak to someone else because I didn't appreciate the awful attitude he was giving me. He said I was welcome to hang up and call back to speak to someone else and he refused to transfer me.All I was trying to do was find out why this TV is having this issue (that many other people are having) and what they were willing to do to correct it. I can't believe this is how they treat their customers.So I'm giving this TV a one-star rating because LG is a horrible company to deal with when you have a customer service or technical issue.

It arrived dented and discolored, however I don't think it was damaged during shipping, I think it was discolored at the factory it was made in.  Regardless, Amazon vowed to ship another one... in one month.  They never received stock of the item, so I ended up with a Sony instead.The time I had this TV, I was not impressed.  I immediately played a blu-ray DVD, and I found that it was incredibly grainy.  At first, I thought it was the DVD itself, but when played on a Bravia, it was flawless.  It's hi-def quality was fine, but certainly not better than technology from 4 years ago.  The speakers on this set were God awful.  I know it's a thin TV, but they were shockingly horrific, trying to adjust the sound did nothing.  Not to worry though, I planned on getting 2.1 computer speakers to solve this problem as the TV had a head phone jack... but it never picked up the subwoofer from them, which was disappointing.  Internet video with the adapter was fantastic, quick, and convenient.  This may have been the best feature of the TV.Aesthetically, I really had a problem with the bezel on this TV.  It was bulky, ugly, and really took away from the TV whether it was on or off.  I will say that I was impressed by the thinness of this TV, however it's a challenge to find a high end TV that's an inch thick or over, so really no bonus points there.

Previously I only went as high as a 22\" due to circumstances.  I've been using this TV for about a month now without any issues.I had been holding out on getting a large TV because I had some specific requirements such as size (between 46\" and 48\") and able to hang because I had purchased a Titan tv stand from DWR at a rediculous sale (worth every penny as it hangs the tv, has 2 shelving and a base for components and rolls) and I wanted to do my homework.This TV fit my needs perfectly and I'm glad I held out for this product.I tend to watch a lot of movies of the sci-fi and horror genre so they tend to be dark and I wanted a TV that displayed well.  This was perfect.  On my smaller LCD TV I have to turn the brightness all the way up and set it on Sports mode just to be able to watch a darker film or tv show and it seems to really do something odd with the screen as a result.This TV was so easy to setup and configure that a novice like me should have no problem.  I probably could have hung it on the stand myself except the base stuck out too far for me to be able to do so.  For those of you who do not want to hang the TV it comes with 2 stand options where 1 is where you can bolt iMy DVD player decided to die at the same time I purchased this TV so I ended up getting an LG Blu-Ray player as well, and it was so easy to set-up with the LG TV.  Given the great pricing of both items (the player I got at a local store) I splurged for a Monster Cable HDMI cable and I'm glad I did.  The picture is absolutely amazing and the TruMotion technology is better than I could hope and I'm sure this cable helps with the transfer rate.My smaller Sharp TV was comical where it looked like the picture would have frozen spots so when you were watching the news or something you would see an area of the forehead not move while the rest of the face did.  It became very distracting.My only complaint, and it has nothing to do with the TV, is that I now need to buy another HDMI cable because the DVDs and Blu-Rays play better than my Comcast HD broadcast.  I started to think it might be the TV but realized the cable I had came with the box and the transfer rate probably sucks which is why I'm seeing some odd slow movement in the cable programs.The sound on this TV is better than I expected.  While it isn't home theater quality, it works well enough for me now until I can save up to get the speakers to complete the home theater experience.  It is also better than any other TV I currently own or have had access to.All of the above were big wins for this TV especially where I was putting it.  My living room is oddly shaped and I refer to it as the bowling alley.  I also don't have any issues with direct sunlight as I live in a townhouse and the afternoon sun is on the other side of the unit and the morning sun is limited due to trees and a porch.  So have no issues with glare.I haven't tried any of the internet options yet but will get there eventually.

For someone like me, not an avid TV watcher it's fine, but for anyone looking for that theater-esque rich sound, you will surely have to hook this up to a sound system.I chose this over a similar sized Samsung for the matte screen offered on the LG.

They make any pans on screen nauseating to watch. I don't think they were on by default, so this shouldn't be an issue for most people.I also ran into a problem with the speakers I had been using before because the TV only has an Optical Audio Out. It was my fault for not checking on it from the beginning, but I am now having to invest in a new speaker set and receiver because converters from analog to digital are too cost prohibitive for what they are. The speakers that are built into the TV are not really going to give you the kind of sound you want when watching something like Blu-Ray, so I would recommend checking on this before you buy.I am very pleased with my purchase. When I started looking for TVs I wanted to purchase an LG from the beginning, but with all of the deals going on at at the time of the super bowl, I had decided to settle on a Vizio instead. I was looking at a comparable LED model of Vizio at Costco, but they sold out before I could buy one. In my attempt to snag one online before I missed the deals entirely, I came across this LG and decided it was well worth the extra $60 I would have to pay for it. A major factor in my decision is that it is backlit versus the side lit Vizio I had been looking at. I wasn't overly concerned about the contrast ratio (which has been reviewed in various places as being very poor) because it was rated so highly on color vibrancy and blending.I have been using the TV several weeks now and I am extremely pleased with the vibrancy of the color and clarity of the picture. I have watched several Blu-Ray movies on it and am blown away by the quality compared to my older TV (a 32\" Olevia). I use the TV primarily for playing video games, and I am amazed by how it can make a mostly drab gray and brown game like Fallout look interesting and vibrant.

The picture is fantastic and I have yet to see any \"lag\".  Remember if you are going to be playing games such as \"Rock Band\", \"Guitar Hero\" and such you need to use the IN-GAME calibration modes to offset video/sound lag.  I also tried out the \"Killzone3\" demo last night and it ran flawlessly on this set...great clarity. Audio from this tv's speakers is \"OK\" but I have a Spherex 5.1 system hooked up and will not be using the \"onboard\" audio.

Recap-  Nice tv for the price!  Very pleased with purchase!Update: 2/20/2011-  Hooked up the Wii last night and \"all is well\".  Connected via COMPONENT (480P).  Games tested:  Super Mario Galaxy,  Donky Kong, Super Monkey Ball...all looked great and ran well.

Macharia", "ReviewID": "R3FVMR9J0JYPMI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is replacing a Tc-L42U25 Panasonic Viera, a unit I really liked. We'll, the price was too good to resist.To the main point:This really is an awesome TV. At 47\" I felt I could keep this for a while before needing a 55\" or so. The bezel on this TV is not one of those huge ones, meaning it will fill the space and look good too. It is also quite thin, about 1.3\" or so thin. Quite surprising actually, certainly something I didn't expect. If you do not have a truck, you would be pleased to note that this fits in a regular sedan rear compartment. Might need  a little nudging but that's the beauty of a thin box!!The picture is very dark, certainly darker than the regular LCD I had by Panasonic. The TV maintains CEC compatibility but as of now, it is gimmicky, and not as seamless as with Panasonic's viera link. Say you have this hooked to a receiver, when you turn on the TV, you'd like for the two devices to turn on and off in harmony, without having to use their respective remotes. The same for volume controls. With viera link, this was accomplished very well. On this one I am able to get it to tun off, but that's about it. I don't know if there is a firmware update needed, but it is something I need to look more into.Netflix streams seamlessly, and my only complaint in this aspect is the scantness of apps available. In fact, one of the more important options in my opinion, Pandora, wasn't on. This makes no sense. They maintain vudu and netflix, both paid services, but didn't think of adding even ordinary music streaming services like spotify or last.fmOther positives are that this TV has an IPS screen, great for wide angle viewing, in addition to a swivel base. Convenient, yes.My biggest problem is with the remote. Notg only huge, I absolutely hate the feel of the buttons and the design in general. Pay a visit to a store and ask to compare the remotes and you feel a difference. IMO, it feels cheap and the buttons are really hard to depress (especially the navigation buttons).Something I feel LG should incorporate is a scroll wheel. This will help when keying in titles in the search tabs.I haven't  experienced the bleeding that most are reporting on here. Not saying its non-existent, just that my data on this would be inconclusive. Right  now I really have to turn off that ambient sensor stuff. It seems to be toggling off and on randomly for some reason. More to comeIn conclusion, this a very nice TV for the price and I am pleased with it so far.... I hope more than anything for longevity.

The internet apps also leave something to be desired, as there are not that many and they are clunky to use.

The ISP is the best, as it has fewer hot spots/flashlighting and a wider viewing angle!!------ To identify an IDP panel from the VA panel...On the right side of the front of the box are bar codes and serial numbers. Under the first bar code, on the right there will be a long number that will have something like ausWlfr or ausDlfr. You want the \"W\" model. If you are confused, check out this link. It explains how to find the correct panel and the thread tells you why you want it.[...]On post 34 there are two pictures. The 4th digit in the last serial number (below the first bar code) needs to be a \"W\", Does'nt matter what the other digits are as long as the 4th is a \"W\".Now on to the review.A short summary of why I have this TV.---------------------------------------------- I purchased a Samsung 46\" 6300 LCD/LED TV on Black Friday for $999.00 with a free Blu Ray player. The TV was remarkable, but it had bright spots in all the corners (flashlighting) and several large spots that were lighter than others (on a completely black screen or dark picture). This was very distracting so I returned it.- I purchased a Samsung 46\" 630 LCD (no LED) for $899.00 hoping to keep the excellent picture quality of the first samsung, minus a little brightness of the LED. The PQ was markedly less and it was slightly blurry. After being very frustrated I returned it and dropped some more money on this 47\" LG LED.---------------------------------- Upon getting the TV home, right off the bat I was very impressed by, of all things,the box of the LG. Once the two straps were cut, the box lifted from the bottom revealing the TV. A nice little touch as it made removing the TV much easier.This was the first of several good impressions LG made on me. The TV build quality seems very sturdy and it's a very nice, thin TV. I am particularly impressed with the power on/off as the power button has neat little rings that light up sequentially followed by the volume/channel buttons and finally the center LG logo. Once you see it, you will understand. Its a geeky thing to like, but the details make stuff nice.----- Picture Quality.- I had the bar set very, very high by the Samsung LED, as it was stunning to look at. This TV is no different. Avatar on Blu Ray looks amazing as well as regular upconverted DVD's. I followed the picture wizard setup thing and it looks wonderful. Wonderful doesn't actually describe it, really. The picture is spectacular. It makes watching some stupid movie my wife likes to watch tolerable because the picture is so vivid and pretty.----- Flashlighting/ hot spots- The reason I returned my Samsung was because of the flashlighting in the corners and the hot spots when there was a dark image on the screen. This TV still has them, but much much much less noticeable. It's tolerable, as I have accepted that no TV will be perfect and the problems I have had are inherent to edge lit LED's. It's minute enough I can watch a movie and not be distracted.- SO if you DO NOT want any flashlighting, its probably best to stay away from LED technology. If you get a screen that doesn't have much or if you can deal with it, you will be very happy with the stunning picture this TV reproduces.----- Gaming- I mainly use my TV for gaming. MY Samsung LED was perfect for gaming, the Sam LCD was blurry enough to hurt my eyes but this LG, I think, looks better. I play FPS's and I play online (Rand0mSmurf is my Xboxlive gamertag) so I can put to rest any doubts about lag. If this TV has it, I can't tell. I have noticed zero lag in any offline or online gaming, nor has anyone else that has gamed on my TV. The images are smooth and crisp. Halo Reach and Halo 3 almost look 3d. No gaming mode is needed as I have the true motion turned on high ( I like the Soap Opera Effect in movies). So if you want this TV for gaming, your're good to go.- Again, this TV makes games look amazing!----- Internet- I set the TV up with a wires connection. It was very easy, as I just followed the directions the TV provided. You have access to widgets, weather, Netflix, stuff like that. I don't really need those things so it doesn't make a difference to me. The ability to update the firmware on the TV is nice though.I hope this review helps somebody decide whether they want this TV or not and if they do help them to get the superior ISP panel over the VA panel.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "not compatible with ps3", "Author": "Ivan R.

It is breathtakingly slim with a very good picture, but beyond that, much of the promotional materials for this unit are inaccurate and deceptive.  For example, it does not have 4M:1 contrast, it's 3M:1.  Not the end of the world, but annoying.  The so-called \"Wireless 1080p Ready\" is extremely misleading, though.  First, you need to buy additional equipment for the TV, so it is no more \"Ready\" than any other set.  Secondly, LG does not mention that you need a wireless-N router and a very fast computer to stream video: minimum 3.50GHZ dual core.  And even then, the manual says that transferring video wirelessly is not recommended, as it won't work well and some features will not be available!  So if you had dreams of streaming Netflix from a router in another room, like I did, forget it.A couple of other things to consider: the hookups on the set are on the back, so despite how thin it is, you'd need to mount it several inches off a wall or create a recess for cords. There are side inputs, but who wants cords sticking out the side?  If you want to hang your flatscreen like a painting, get the Samsung.  I also find the remote very annoying, with many crowded, flat buttons that keep getting pressed accidentally because you can't feel where they are.  And you may need that remote more often than you expect because nearly everything you play will need the picture adjusted not only for aspect ratio but for shape within that aspect.  Every DVD and TV program is different, and the TV itself does not take this into account. (I don't know if this is a problem with all HDTVs or just this one.)Still, having said all that, if you are looking for a no frills HDTV, and you have a universal remote, the price seems pretty good.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "bad engineering", "Author": "the deaf one", "ReviewID": "RIZLM8RUMKR48", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love the picture.

After tweaking colors and using recommended settings from trusted sources I was very unimpressed overall with this set.  First negative was the \"motion Control\" - Makes everything look \"fake\" or mellow video?  Makes movies/film 24f stuff look like video.  I don't understand how this is a \"feature\".  The only time I found this look acceptable was sports that where shot in 720p - Football etc.  Otherwise I shut it off.CONS:1. Speakers! - Yes, I have a surround sound system but sometimes it's nice just to flip the TV on without it.  The sound is terrible and I playes with settings with no desirable results.  Clear voice only made things worse.2. Panel.  The worst angle viewing I have seen.  Flash Lighting - Dark scenes or transitions are terrible as you can see the lights bleed through.3. Overall Picture.  Color reproduction is weak, Black Levels weak, too many constant tweaks to get an acceptable picture.  When watching 24p content it was unwatchable imho.4. Lag.  This might be a combination on my Cable box but my Plasma never lagged as bad as this unit does.  When switching inputs or different HD configurations it lags several seconds.PROS:  Low Energy consumption, however I think many will put in Vivid Mode which is much less efficient.  Size and Weight is a plus.  Web Apps/Internet - after several initial lengthy updates the apps are kind of cool but nothing you can't get on most cell phones these days.Bottom line this TV is just not for me - I am in the \"video/film\" business so I kind of know a good looking picture v.s. weak and I feel this TV is weak.

It is slim with a very good picture after some tweaking.Pro: Slim with LED backlit, high contrast ratio (inflated), internal speakers are good consider its size;With a wired network, online streaming from Youtube is smooth, but not tested with Netflix.Now I am talking about some issue and design flaws it has:1. I knew it's a HDTV, but people still use analog signal of 480i, e.g. from VCR. It produce terrible picture, looks like out-of focus picture, far behind Samsung 52\" LCD purchased few years ago; Is can't decode some HD channels (e.g. 4.1) while my Samsung can from the same cable.2. It does NOT has RCA line-level audio output. it is almost impossible to connect a wireless headphone(talk about it later) or a standalone sub-woofer to increase the bass without a receiver.3. It has a headphone jack, sounds nice. But it can only drive 16_Ohm impedance with 15mW max output, I use a Sennheiser HD-201 headphone, it can hardly drive it loud enough even with TV maximum volume of 100 to get clear sound, compare to the volume set at 10~15 use with internal speakers.4. It has a Toslink optical output, which can be kooked to a receiver. Ironically, it can sense the headphone jack plug and shut-off the optical output once you plug in. This is the most stupid design that you have to plug/unplug the headphone instead of using the remote.5. For the wireless headphone connection, I tried to use its headphone jack to my Sennheiser RS-130, which works perfect previously with RCA line-level output. but I have to jump the TV volume to 100(full) to get a clear sound, and wake whole family up if I unplug it and forgot to lower the volume.Since most advanced sound processor are configurable to drive a headphone or line-out(like in most desktop), so I think it's possible to customer the choice in a firmware update, so I will contact LG CS. and will report back if I ever get any response.I don't recommend it if you ever want to use a headphone or 2-ch soundbar with RCA input, like Boston Acoustic TVee.First Update:Tried to contact their CS using online email, but at last step when press \"Submit\" button, it give me an error msg, really frustrated. So I tried live-chat and sent my questions. The CS is nice and promise me will submit a \"Voice of Customers complaint\". Will post what I got from LG.Second Update:After 2 months, I didn't hear a single word from LG. They simply don't care. The current DSP all comes with configurable output, in other words, a audio connector can be configured as Microphone/Line output/input/headphone, just like what you can do with desktop. So LG can simply give customer the choose to configure the audio output, but they don't care.So consider the drawbacks before you buy: - can't use any 2-chan amplifier; - Can't use Boston TVee soundbar; - Can't use standalone sub-woofer; - Can't use wireless headphone properly; - Poor wired headphone support on volume;The bottom line: Still a good TV if you don't care.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "LED Backlighting\nNetCast Entertainment Access (Wi-Fi Ready)\nWireless 1080p Ready\nTruMotion 120Hz\nPicture Wizard II", "Name": "LG 47LE5400 47-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED HDTV with Internet Applications (2010 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OmTMz2SkL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003BO4H56"}}
