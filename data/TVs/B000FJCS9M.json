We picked up this model for our bedroom after doing a lot of searching online. Over all I feel that it is a quality TV. You have to play with the screen settings to get the picture to really come to life, you should not expect any LCD TV to be perfect out of the box.  Have a good color DVD around that will allow you to bring in the right colors and it will look great.  The sound quality is pretty nice, though this unit has no audio out. It does have a headphone jack so if you have the correct cable you can connect it to a stereo system.  One thing that I will give you is that the remote that comes with this TV is by far the CHEAPEST remote I have ever seen. Think \"dollar store\" remote, my advice is get a nice universal remote. The TV has a modest amount of controls like, Brightness, Tint, Color, Contrast, V-Chip setup, Backlight adjustment, sound control and a few others. Over all I am very please with this TV. Just remember the remote is very,  very cheap.", "Date": "November 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture...", "Author": "Brian M. \"Brian\"", "ReviewID": "RLLYRJULCKGDI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV has a good picture. Good color and nice an bright.  You can see some light around the edges of the screen, especially on dark pictures.  The remote is awful.  The layout is bad and the keys are tiny.  The sound is a little tinny and doesn't have much bass.", "Date": "December 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Be careful", "Author": "Denise G. Hinds \"wind dancer\"", "ReviewID": "R1YTONEPU6VP98", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm extremely disappointed in this product, the company, and \"service\".  Within 1 month of receiving the TV, the picture went bad.  It had the appearance of looking at a negative in color.  I called the company who seemed less than interested in helping resolve the problem.  The best they could do is send me to an authorized service center.  Closest one is 60 miles from my house.  They never offered to send me a new one and let me return the old one.  So, I take it to the ASC.  More than 2 weeks later, I'm told the panel is bad and they'll have to send it to the Funai Corporation and its going to take a month or more to get a new one back.  Now I've been out a television for over 2 months, and it was \"Brand New\".I will never buy Sylvania again and thought it important to let others be aware of their sloppy product and inefficient warranty terms.", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sylvania LCD 20\" TV", "Author": "M.

To my perception the colors and image sharpness are amazing. I mounted this TV on an articulated wall mount and the combination is perfect for saving space. I did not give 5 stars because of the remote control, although it works ok the buttons are really small and overall it looks like a \"pi\u00f1ata\" article. But the TV is good for the price.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "helpful hint about this product", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R43UZ0BNUU3KQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV and the screen started getting lines on the left side of the screen because it was over heating but i took it apart and took some clamps and added a xbox 360 intercooler and now the problem is gone and the intercooler fits perfectly on the back vents hope this was helpful", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great bedroom TV", "Author": "mermaid_babe", "ReviewID": "R1IQZ8S6XPIYMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV since 2006, when I bought it the day after Thanksgiving for only $100. At the time it came out it was originally $500. It has been a great TV. The picture is clear, the sound is good, and there's no glare since it's a LCD. I have had no problems with it at all. It's the perfect size for watching TV in your bedroom. It's also very lightweight.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "A little troublesome", "Author": "Natalie Pantaleo", "ReviewID": "R3GD913W8SKAJT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Seller failed to indicate that the TV stand had been removed.

The menus are rather limited, and the remote is very basic and feels cheaply made.After a while, I decided to hang the set on a wall.
