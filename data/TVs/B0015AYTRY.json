{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Really nice LCD... good customer service", "Author": "A. Williams", "ReviewID": "R1H18NRPNEIDD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my tv with a damaged panel.  Thankfully, Samsung provides free in-home repair for their products through their authorized repair agents.  It was a good experience, relatively hassle free, and now the TV looks as good as it should have to begin with.  It has all of the basic functions that you'd look for, including 2 HDMI and 2 component inputs, and a host of picture settings.  The sound is fine but not thrilling, and chances are it's a bedroom tv (my situation) or you have a surround sound hookup through the digital audio out.  I am very pleased with the depth of the blacks, as at 8,000:1 the contrast ratio is as high as many plasmas were just a year ago.  The color accuracy is quite good (once you do some calibration to your tastes) and the dedicated brightness setting helps you customize it to the brightness of the room you are in.  I haven't noticed any false conturing nor any motion blur, as the refresh rate is also good.  Though maxing out at 1080i/720p, at this size the extra dollars for 1080p are really wasted.  Save your money there and get a 19-in LCD for the kitchen!  My simple, yet favorite, feature is the input recognition.  No cycling through all possible inputs to get to the one you want; only active inputs come up when cycling through your sources.  Nothing really negative to say... other than the lag between turning on the set and getting a picture, but that is a common LCD trait.  The TV's design is attractive, has all of the features you really need, and was a really reasonable price (thank you Lightning Deals!).  I recommend it.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Among the best at this size ...", "Author": "M. C. Sample", "ReviewID": "R2ZA6MTP986MDK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having worked previously as an electronics salesman, I have a working knowledge of HDTVs.  I always recommended the Samsung models as \"among the best,\" but never had seen one within a home and running as most consumers would.  Until recently ...My mother owns this model and has for a few weeks now.  It's classy-looking with a glossy outer bezel and an oval stand (included).  The TV itself seems larger than the competitors, simply because the speakers are located on the sides.  This helps give a more natural-sounding stereo effect without the extra cost of a home theater system.  It's just got a high-end, quality look to it.  Samsung LCDs are renowned for having a top-notch viewing angle.  This holds true with this model.  Stand nearly 180\u00b0 to the side, and the picture is still bright and clear.  LCDs have come a long way in a few short years.The remote is well-marked and easy to use.  TV-accessed menus are simple and quick to navigate.  My mother, not well-versed in knowledge of consumer electronics, was able to configure the settings herself with very little help.Unlike lower-end competitors, though, this 3-series Samsung does not offer any separate composite hookups (the 3 red, white, and yellow plugs).  One of the component hookups must be used in place.  If you have, say, a DVD/VCR combo, Dish Network (non-HD), and a Nintendo Wii to all hookup, you're out of luck.  There simply isn't room for more than 2 non-HD inputs.  It can be annoying to have to repeatedly unplug and replug items into your new TV.  If you plan on using at least one of the HDMI plugs, though, this problem is avoided.  However, be aware that most direct competitors do offer more non-HD hookups.For the price, you can find larger TVs.  Big retailers are often willing to sell last year's models at cheaper prices (ie 720p TVs) because most people spending $700+ want the latest and greatest.  If you just want a quality TV and you plan on using the HDMI hookups for true High Definition viewing, this is probably the best picture you'll find.  I made sure my mom knew what to look for when she went shopping - and she agreed by getting this one.Best of luck to you!", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great low cost second HDTV", "Author": "Leedoh", "ReviewID": "R1PGNJ3NRT71ZH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV for our basement for the Wii that we just purchased as we have a 55 inch DLP upstairs for our normal viewing. The reason why we got a lower end LCD was 1 price, 2 it wasn't going to be our everyday TV to watch so I wasn't quite as concerned with the picture quality, and 3 we wanted to mount it on the wall so that we would not have issues with hitting it with our Wii remotes. The picture quality is great with the Wii and is good for TV. I would recommend this TV for someone that isn't going to use it as their primary TV. If they were buying a primary TV I would suggest spending more and getting a 1080p as you can see the difference in picture quality. Again though, this TV delivered on why I got it and didn't disappoint one bit.", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good price, good quality and good delivery service", "Author": "J.

Of course, dealing with AMAZON was easy and flawless as usual. I love using AMAZON!  The TV arrived early and with everything needed for a quick set up.  Worked perfectly from minute one.

My budget allowed about $600-$700. For the most part, I found I could easily buy a 32\" tv, but I really wanted a 37\". I found some, but they were from manufacturers whom I'd never heard from.I'd done my research with Consumer Reports, visited several brick & morter stores as well as online stores. I didn't plan to purchase an extended warranty so I wanted to find one from a company with few returns. (Samsung was in Consumer Reports' top 5 list of companies to buy tv's from.) Although this exact model wasn't tested, several other similar models were and all ranked well.I ordered through Amazon, but it came from 6ave.com. The price was right ($[...] w/free shipping & no tax), but I was very hesitant to order something as fragile as a television online. My worries were unfounded. While the outside box was taped poorly and was \"leaking\" styrofoam peanuts, the tv was in another box and was in perfect condition.Set up was a snap and I am more than pleased with my purchase. Picture quality is excellent. The built-in sound system is great. While I've only had this for a couple days, I am very pleased with my investment.

I got this TV for dirt cheap. I got it hooked up via component cables through my cable box and the picture looks crisp! I don't know why but my cable box doesn't have an HDMI outlet, but it does have 2 firewire ports and a USB port, WTF?! Shame on Cox Cable. I do however have HDMI hooked up through my PS3 and the picture is far superior than my HD Cable. The speakers are surprisingly good, especially through HD sound on Blu-ray, can't ask for more for a bedroom TV.
