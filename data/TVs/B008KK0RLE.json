We where in the market for a new TV/surround system for our living room and in the past we have had a large screen TV with a Bose Lifestyles 25 (cira 2000) system so we where accustomed to haveing a nice sounding media center. The issues we shere looking to overcome with the new system where:1. Something to eleviate all of the speakers and wires that come with such a system. 6+ speakers and wires to power them, plus the head unit, and this is a simple system.2. Remotes, OMG, one for the TV, one for the Sound, one for the cable box, one for the Blueray, one for the Apple TV. Total of 5....wow.3. To have a much \"cleaner\" look to the LR with out all of these components out in the open for all to see as they must be for the IR remotes to function.As I stated at the begining I was a bit underwelmed seeing and hearing it in the store. The picture quality was great but it did not sound all that great, good but not great.What was interesting was the remote. One remote to control all of the components? Is that possible? and can put them in a enclosed cabinet so they are not visible?! (The Bose remote operates on a radio freq. instead of IR)So they offer a 30 day money back guarantee. I'll bite, when can you deliver and set up? (included in the price) Next day.... GREAT!Went to the furniture store to pick up the enclosed entertainment stand that hides all of the components that I had my eye on. TV will be the only thing sitting on the top of it!Next day the gentleman showed up and intalled the TV, all components in the cabinet and most importantly, cablibated the the TV and sound to the room it is located.Now for the ah ha moment. He turned it on and WOW, just WOW, the whole room was filled with sound!!! Incredible. It sounded so much better that it did in the showroom. Maybe all of the backround noise in the store? or not calibrated the same? Dont know but it sounds great in the LR. No way this is going back!!!!Now for the remote. It is incredible. I can control all of the components and a connected Ipod with just one remote via the onscreen menus that pop up when using that component. It has to be experienced to trully appriciate.Now for price. It is expensive but consider what it does. One remote for everything. No speakers and wires hanging on the wall or sitting on a stand. Ya, you can intall speakers in a wall but you have grilles in the wall and how much does that cost to install, plus components and you cant take them with you if you move.This system is a true entertainment system, plays music(streaming and iPod, CD's), movies(streaming and DVD/Blueray).If your not a anal audio file or video geek and just want great sounding and TV/music viewing experience, this is the system for the rest of us.I have owned this system since fall of 2012 and still feel the same way as the day it was delivered. If you can afford it, go for it.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture, excellent sound, the ULTIMATE simplicity!", "Author": "DMH", "ReviewID": "R1NS7QQR7B4AUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I own a VW 46\" model for my secondary room, main room is full Bose surround with a high end Sony HDTV.  Here's what the VideoWave is supposed to be in MY opinion, something that has an excellent picture, excellent sound, AND the ultimate simplicity!  There's no Bluray built in or apps, that would add software to the Bose console that would eventually be outdated because hardware will eventually limit software.  Let's be honest, if you have the money to buy this, you can go buy a $100 streaming box (AppleTV or Roku 3) or use your Bluray player to stream plus play your Blu-ray Discs, DVDs and CDs.  Adding and removing sources is a much better solution than needing to upgrade the console every few years, and Bose knows it.  A few things you might also want to know, no AM/FM (I'm assuming that wired antennas takes away from the clean look, plus we're using less and less radio anyways, at least in my house.) and the universal remote is AMAZING!  If you live close to a Bose store, check it out in store, the employees are helpful and you can get a good hands on demo, especially of that remote.  If you're the type that you have to have an 80\" TV taking up a whole wall, and still want Bose, try out the Bose Lifestyle 135 soundbar, if the 46\" or 55\" Bose TV is close in size to what you were thinking anyways, the price is worth the time and money you'll save not having to piece together a tv, separate components, and installing it yourself / paying for installation.  The Bose installation included with this product was satisfactory.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding!", "Author": "Spunkychk \"Book Freak\"", "ReviewID": "R1IAC76BUGTT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV sounds excellent! Ignore the one star that lowered this TV's rating. It has a surround sound effect though all the speakers are built-in across the top (9 of them) and others along the sides. I paid extra for the set-up which included the lesson in my home, removal of unwanted equipment, moving of the other equipment and furniture by a Bose electronic sound contractor and his helper. They set up the sound to adjust to my room using a headphone and sensor system. It was quite interesting. They ran the demo and it was super! The set up my other devices including the blue ray, ipod, and the cable box. I do not have to use the other remotes any more... all the remote control programing was downloaded into the TV box.The Bose remote controls everything you need in a very simple system. It was designed by geniuses. It's the most simple system imaginable with a cool touch pad that took about two seconds to figure out. I'm so happy not to have the thousands of buttons on the various remotes ... everything you need is up on the screen!The first network show I watched was the MLB All Star Game. The sound actually made me feel as if I was sitting right in the stand... I even heard some yelling \"Hotdog!\" and the hum of the energy coming from thousands of fans. The commercials during this show were absolutely amazing!! I had no idea how improved sound is for the home coming just from the TV. Originally I wanted true surround sound, but plan on moving so I didn't want to set up a speaker system. This was the best decision even if I weren't moving.I've played several movies now - from Netflix, Showtime, YouTube and DVD (not BlueRay yet). All demonstrated surround sound effect gloriously. Of course a true surround system by Bose would be nice, but I'm thrilled about this purchase. I got a discount as the TV is a factory refurbish. It's just fine. Also I'm paying for it without interest. It's quite expensive, I know. But for me, it is worth it.This TV is way ahead of the pack. The pictures are crisp. The sound will blow your socks off. There are so many innovations it comes with I can't list them all here. I can't wait to get home to watch it every day.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best sounding tv on the market!", "Author": "Spartan", "ReviewID": "R2CRWE5PQ7T5DQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to the Bose store the other day and i saw the theater show that they had, and the VideoWave was the most amazing sounding TV I have ever heard. Like some other people have said already the TV is really expensive! but honestly what other TV  manufacturer has a TV that sounds even close to this? there really is none except for the Bang and Olufsen beo vision 11 which cost 15 thousand dollars! and the VidoeWave sounds better! so really this is a good price point.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "If this is a joke on TV buyers, it isn't funny. Bose, shame on you.", "Author": "Jane Doe \"Jane Doe\"", "ReviewID": "R65SPPYZ7N38S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am going to be harsher to this bose TV. The panel itself is made by Samsung, a very competent panel manufacturer. However, after visiting the bose shop, just to see if this TV could live up to the hype (marketed by bose of course), and, no, it couldn't.Firstly, the TV in Canada (in the Bose shop) is an eye-watering $5,400, plus 5% sales tax and another 20 or so bucks recycling levy. Over $5,500 for a TV this size? Seriously bose?Really?Really?I figured the picture accuracy would be incredible owing to it being a Samsung panel at least, to make up for the immediately impressive 'surround' sound. (more on the ultimately inaccurate sound later)Nope. Despite me twiddling with the picture controls, as the sales guy looked on (who wasnt aware you could adjust the video controls) the picture accuracy is simply painfully awful. I will explain.Ive been in the electronics retail industry a while. Ive learned how to calibrate a TV (ISF Certified) and get it looking as best as possible. Sure, you can twiddle with a normal TV and get it looking non awful, but you need test cards, filters and colourmeters to get it way closer.EVERY tv I have ever calibrated or adjusted for friends and family has at least a smattering of picture controls, if not always seperately controlled red green blue. The bose TV has a pitifully limited control interface. It has contrast, brightness, colour, sharpness, and display mode, (cinema, sports etc) The sliders only go down a MAX of -7 on each and a max of +7, if you want it to look more awful than it is already.No tint/hue, no advanced greyscale, no obvious way to disable frame interpolation, the retina frying dynamic contrast etc. I dialed down each of the limited controls on the TV, and it still looked like crap.Way to go bose, put a Samsung panel in your TV, but use your own weird display algorithms set it at 'mega bright shop mode' and prevent the user from making much different.If I had my colourmeter with me and my laptop, I shudder to think how way off base the colours were. Everyone looked like Snooki, even with colour reduced to maximum.You heard it here first folks, the Bose videowave TV is *impossible* to calibrate. Maybe entering the service menu used by TV repairmen might tone it down, but good luck finding that code out from Bose.I emailed Bose to ask why the controls were so limited, and why I couldnt get it lower than -7. Bose's answer essentially was \"were a private company and we dont have to tell anyone anything.\" So instead of helping, Bose weren't at liberty to say. Charming.Now, onto the sound. There are 16 speakers in the TV, according to the salesman. Looking at the thickness of the unit it had to be a whopping 10 inches. Looking into the grilles surrounding the tv, the most of the speakers looked to be the same as the ones used in the wave radio. The cheap paper cones. Yep. Those ones. Also used in the Bose companion 2 computer speakers, and at least one of the lifestyle system satellites. Bose must get a discount buying them from china or something...The sound, as I mentioned, is initially impressive on a scale and bravado basis but after listening to it a while, using my own reference music playing some contralto vocalists, like Maria Callas the audio was tiring and I wanted to turn it down. Good hifi you dont need to turn down. Lowfi irritates quickly and has one reaching for the volume.If there was supposed to be any 'surround' going on, I couldnt really perceive it. Just to correct other posters, in no way does the TV, or any of the bose 'home theatre' systems do DOLBY digital 5.1. Sure, they do digital 5.1, but not Dolby. There is a difference. Ray Dolby's 'Dolby Laboratories' company only allow companies to put 'dolby digital/dolby pro logic IIz' on the equipment if it can do it. Same with DTS. Bose doesn't do either.Neither has bose passed any of George Lucas' THX equipment certifications. Nor, will THX pass ANY of Bose equipment. Why? THX require full disclosure of how a manufacturers equipment works, the power used, the frequency response, sensitivity and a myriad of other things so they can test it. Bose has never, and probably will never, disclose anything other than the physical size of their equipment. Kinda like Ford making a new Mustang but declining to tell anyone the horsepower and torque.Note the amount of THX certified cinemas. As far as I know, there isn't ONE cinema in North America that is equipped with Bose speakers.In conclusion, this TV is staggeringly poor value for money for its size, horribly hobbled by short-sighted controls, leviathan heavy and audio like being on the receiving end of a baseball throwing machine.For $5000 one can buy a Sharp Quattron 80\" and have a few hundred left to buy a well regarded Panasonic HTIB. Sure, quattrons arent the last word in colour accuracy, but at least one can disable the yellow pixel and calibrate the damn things. Hell, one can buy LG/Samsung plasmas at 65\" for around $1700. (Irony, plasma is better tech than LCD/LED.)If this TV is a joke on bose customers, it isnt funny. Bose, I hope you are ashamed of yourselves.Bose has to walk the talk before they are taken seriously by people in the hifi biz. They say they are the best? Prove it. It's no good replying to the question, \"why do you say you are good?\" with, \"because we said so.\".", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008KK0RLE"}}
