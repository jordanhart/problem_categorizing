The size appears to be slightly bigger than another 50\" HDTV I was comparing it to. The picture quality is excellent. There was one thing that I had to get adjusted to... the speakers are built in the back of the TV set. So at times I had to increase the volume therefore the sound could project louder...however that issue was quickly rectified by purchasing an affordable wireless sound bar. Normally I do not leave review comments but I figure it helped me select this brand and I could do the same for someone else who is looking to purchase an affordable, great quality, HDTV.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$469.97", "Features": "Affinity SLE3050M 50\" Class LED HDTV", "Name": "Affinity SLE3050M 50\" Class LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VxqhODaWL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DI5324U"}}
