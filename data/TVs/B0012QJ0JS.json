I am impressed.Beware that you CANNOT have both a yellow composite video cable AND a S-Video plugged in at the same time, it will overheat and destroy the unit. I made this mistake. Afterwards I read the users manual (yes I am a man) and read the warning clearly states in there that it is an EITHER OR thing. The picture is really nice and you can output the sound to your high powered amplifier receiver with the Coaxial SPDIF Out. The remote is lame and the speakers wimpy, but like I said, you can output the sound to an amp. For the price this is a fantastic deal. Nice picture.", "Date": "March 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Daniel W. Clark \"Timberline Photography\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZIKNHC10317J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purcahsed this Television/Monitor for use while deployed to Iraq.  I have AFN television, my personal Laptop, and a PSP hooked up to the monitor.  It works very well and has a phenominal picture.  I am a professional photographer and I edit my pictures on this screen.  The clarity and vivid color make the process very easy.  The conditions in Iraq are terrible for a TV/Monitor but this one endures very well.  It is constantly covered in extremely find sand, tt is exposed to regular power outages and surges, and it gets left on for very long periods of time.  It does far better than most of the brand name flat panel TVs the Army purchases for use.  I am anxious to see how it survives the trip home.  (I purchased a pelican case to protect it during shipping home, although it shipped here in the cardboard box from the retailer.)  There are 6 different inputs (including 1-HDMI) and it is very simple to switch from one to another.  It has a very intuitive program guide (AFN does not broadcast a program guide, and yet the TV can ID many programs).  I don't understand complaints about the speakers at all.  They're not the greatest, but for a TV of this size, they're dang good.  I saw the warning about hooking both S-video and component up, so I have not done that.  The remote is small and simple...which for me is a plus!  I don't need all of the complicated buttons that don't do anything.  It has all the functions I need.  All in all, this is a very good product and well worth the price.  A Great Value.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Remarkable Value", "Author": "Nathan Beauchamp \"ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...", "ReviewID": "R19YH4HWOGY3WG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not usually a fan of off brand TVs, but for the price, this is a fantastic 23\" option. The picture is clear and accurate (enough) at both 720p and 1080i resolutions. The color accuracy is fairly good, but I did have to tweak things a bit to get a picture that wasn't too saturated. Thankfully the menus are actually very intuitive.The volume level on this TV is fairly low, so I suggest getting an inexpensive 2.1 speaker system to handle processing your audio.Connectivity is pretty good and includes: 1 HDMI, 1 VGA (no DVI which would have been nice, but you can use a HDMI to DVI converter) your standared composite connection, and S-video, and a video in. Output includes an SPDIF Out which is awesome for digital sound. Try to find speakers that will take advantage of the SPDIF out if possible. It will dramatically improve the sound quality.This monitor is HDCP compatible, which means you can use it with a computer to play HD content like Blue Rays. This is great if you plan on using this as a monitor.One complaint is that the TV is a bit slow to respond to input from the remote. This happens when navigating the menu, or when changing inputs. However, it's only a minor issue.This TV is a bargain for the price. The features, display quality, and overall value for the price is exceptional. This is NOT an videophile TV and will not impress the extremely picky. However, if you want a solid TV without spending a fortune, the Sceptre Naga 23\" is a great option.", "Date": "February 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not bad for an off-brand TV", "Author": "Travis Kahrs", "ReviewID": "R3ME7EZ7ZL1LAX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sceptre is a newer brand of TV and they are not really known for their quality, but this television seems fine. I purchased it for a family friend who seems to like it very much, but I did notice a few small things about it when I was setting it up. For the most part, as with everything, you get what you pay for. This is certainly not as fully featured and nice as a name brand television, but it works for a second tv pretty well. It is relatively small, 23 inches isn't really that big, and you can really only watch it from no more than 12-15 feet away, or else it is difficult to see what exactly is going on. The stand is cheap, and it doesn't seem to be all that sturdy; again, you get what you pay for. Overall, I suppose this is a good value, but remember that for only a few hundred dollars more, you can get a quality, name brand, larger television that will probably outlast and outperform anything that says \"Sceptre\" on it.", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not bad for a starter HDTV", "Author": "Luke K.", "ReviewID": "R2C66EUD7011XD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first purchased this TV back in August of 2008 when at the time HDTV's were just starting to ease their way down in price.  They were well known, but still pretty expensive.  I payed $350, which seems like a lot, but similar sized sets by Sony, Samsung, and Panasonic went for well over $450 at the time.  I knew very little about HDTV's and never heard of the Sceptre brand, and I consider myself very lucky that this set is still running strong.  I can only speak for myself, but I am more than content with what I got.  The only problem I ever had came from the second I plugged it in, I had a stalled blue pixel, right smack dab in the middle of the screen which is still there to this day.  I had read a few reviews with people reporting the same issue, I just assumed I was gonna get lucky,...not.  But honestly, it's only noticeable during dark scenes in shows/movies.  It's really nothing more than a minor annoyance, nothing to really ruin the quality of the set or your viewing experience.  4 years later this set is still going strong, it's taken a  few bumps and hits now and again and I've had no issues.  No loss in picture quality, haven't needed to adjust the settings over time to compensate a loss in brightness even.  The only other downside is the remote.  All the buttons have worn down to no print at all, and will hardly work even with new batteries.  But it's an easy fix with a universal remote from Wal-Mart or Best Buy.  There are a few things I could note that I don't like, but I have to remind myself, this is an off brand, it's not gonna have all the bells and whistles.  But even so, it's a very solid TV to start out with.  It's not the best, but it's not TLC, Pro Scan, or Westinghouse.  I'd put it somewhere between Vizio and LG in terms of quality.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "bad purchase", "Author": "PhiHous", "ReviewID": "R2HWXGX4TN9Z3O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very unhappy.
