We thought it was the cable box, had the company out, not the problem. I researched on the internet and others had this problem and it was the power board. I Called Aquos and told them the problem and what we thought it might be, they sent out a repair crew, who thought it might be the speakers, or main board. They returned a few days later and replaced those two items, but the high pitched squeal remained. So they agreed to try and replace the power board. Another trip a week later and they replaced the power board... Ta da, the squeal was gone BUT now we could no longer connect to the internet wirelessly, which apparently is a main board issue. Arghhhhhhh. After a number of conversations with Aquos , they finally agreed to replace the whole thing, which they delivered today. It's now working, cross my fingers it stays that way.  Also,we used the calibration settings listed here and they greatly improved the picture quality.Bottom line, after 5 different service calls,  it's a great picture, the wireless access is fabulous for the wii and apple TV, it was just very painful and time consuming to get to this point.ps .the delivery guy said they have quite a few of these TVs, 60 and 52 inch that they have to pick up. At least Sharp replaced it, hopefully they'll continue to stand by their product if it goes haywire again.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "M. Vance", "ReviewID": "R1PNEQZ1EH8EII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very large TV with an outstanding picture.  So far the menus are easy to navigate and adjustments to almost anything can be made.  There many advanced picture adjustments that are easy to find so you can tweak the picture to your liking.  Out of the box in the \"standard\" picture mode the color temp was a little cold for my liking but after adjusting that the color was exactly what I was looking for.  The \"dynamic\" and \"dynamic-fixed\" modes are useless and greatly over saturate all colors.  Most picture modes have the \"film mode\" defaulted to on, this creates the very annoying \"soap opera effect\".  Turn it off and everything looks great.I did have an issue with the sound being out of sync with my surround sound system when coming from my satellite box.  Originally I had an HDMI cable routed from my satellite box to the TV, then an optical cable from the satellite box to SS receiver.  By routing the optical cable from the TV to the SS receiver fixed the issue.  There seems to be a delay in video and audio processing in the TV which lead the audio from the SS to be ahead of the picture when I had it routed the first way.  I only had this issue with satellite, blu-ray seems to be in sync and it is has its audio routed from the player directly to the SS receiver.  When initially setting up the tv you have to select \"set top box\" for satellite and I think this might be where the TV induces the delay.  The TV's speakers are average for a tv of this size, its only 1.75\" thick so you cant expect much in the way of quality audio when the speakers are that thin.  This is normal on every tv of this size that I have seen so I will not grade lower.  I would think if you have a 60\" tv you probably already have a SS system anyway, or at least a sound bar.The tv has a feature called OPC that automatically adjusts screen brightness based on the amount of light in the room, at first I thought this would be a gimmick that I would just turn off but it actually works quite well.  It keeps you from having multiple user settings for watching in various lighting conditions. This makes the tv more user friendly because you dont need to always be adjusting it.The tv also has built in WIFI which is an upgrade from the previous model, I have only used it on NETFLIX so far.  Streaming was easy to setup and worked fine but until Netflix streams in HD the large 60\" screen just amplifies the fuzziness of low resolution streaming video.  The WIFI is also great for software up dates.Was very easy to mount on the wall and its lighter than my older 46\" Toshiba.  All things considered this is a great TV that 97% of consumers would be happy with.  The other 3% will always find something to be unhappy about.UPDATE AUG2011: For surround sound, route the optical cable from the TV to the surround sound receiver, not DVD player to surround sound receiver.  I know I stated earlier that my BluRay player seemed to be more in sync with the tv picture but it is not.  The delay was much less than coming from the satellite but there is still a slight delay in audio.  If you run an optical cable from the tv to the surround sound receiver the TV process the sound the same as the picture and there is no delay.  The only problem with this is the TV only puts out Dolby Digital and cannot output DTS, so for people who favor DTS (me) you will have to either learn to like Dolby or listen to DTS audio that is not in sync with the picture of the TV.  Hope this helps those have have run into the \"out of sync\" issue.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommended", "Author": "Richard Kurlander", "ReviewID": "R38NK7Y9HGQH61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a couple weeks of research and many hours standing in front of TVs at Best Buy - the Sharp LC60LE830U turned out to be a great choice.

Amazon's price, with free white glove delivery makes this a no-brainer.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, although possibly too many options for setup", "Author": "thundercade", "ReviewID": "R3OFWF9BMN8DCY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture looks amazing on this guy, especially with nice HD content or a Blu-ray playing. And, it looks great in dark or bright rooms which is nice if you're like me and have it in a larger room where you might be doing a movie night with lights off or just hanging out and the girlfriend wants to be reading/working/on computer.So, overall, great picture and I think the sound is beyond expectations for a thin TV. But, the following is worth reading through if you're picky like me.Couple notes on the options I think are worth spelling out:1) There are a lot of them as far as picture setup goes. Thankfully, there are several posts here, on CNET and on AVS forums about settings people have tried as far as the Advanced Color settings are concerned. But I will say, I don't really feel like I should have to go that deep to by happy with my TV picture. I feel like it took awhile to find the preset/settings that most content will look good on for me, almost to the point where I started to feel hopeless about it.2) As others have said, \"Film Mode\" is default set to ON for most picture presets. This makes no sense to me, as it creates a very strong \"soap opera\" effect. So, just go through each one and turn it off and be done with it. HOWEVER - I did notice that when playing a Blu-ray CG cartoon movie (in my case, Kung Fu Panda) having the Film Mode set to ON actually created a very nice almost simulated 3D effect, and was very cool. But ONLY on that type of content. For all others, leave it off and never go back.3) The OPC function, when set to ON will auto adjust the backlight (at least I think that's what it's doing). This seems to work fine, and the picture looks great, I'm just not sure why they put the option on there. At first I thought \"oh nice, if I turn the lights on/off, it will adjust\" but it doesn't seem to do that. All that really happens, is, when you turn this option OFF, the TV just gets a lot brighter. I guess I'd much rather just turn the backlight down to what looks good once, then be done with it.4) I found that just leaving motion enhancement to OFF was the best, but I don't watch a lot of sports, so that might be a totally different story there.Beyond the options, here are a few other things worth mentioning:1) You can notice some unevenness in backlighting when the screen is all white or black. When all black you can see bright spots, and when all white the corners look unevenly dark. The dark corners also seems to be an inconsistent thing - not always there. I think all this is just a drawback of such a large Edge-lit LED LCD.2) As some others have said, the remote does feel cheap. I only mention this because the button presses just feel \"wrong\" and I had the Flashback button (a.k.a. Previous Channel button) stick on me more than once which then constantly switched the channel until I figured out what had happened. And, there's a bit of an audible click when pressing a button - not really that loud, but I've never had a remote (for anything) that felt like this before.The only reason i'm letting all that take away one star is mainly because of the first thing - I just feel that I have to screw around too much with the settings to get it right. I love the picture, but several times I was left with the feeling \"well, does that look weird because the TV is weird or is it because I just happened to pick some weird combination of 7 different settings??\".  And, I still don't feel like there's one preset I can use for just about everything I watch (except for games, which I don't mind switching for). I play DVDs, Blu-rays, Games, Hulu, Netflix and video from a PC all on my PS3 - so the input memory of the preset doesn't really help me there. I don't want to have to switch every time I play something different.With all that said - this is a tremendous value for the price. If 60\" is the size you're after, it's very hard to beat this if you don't mind all the options (and of course, some people expect that level of control for the money).", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best TV I've ever owned", "Author": "db", "ReviewID": "R2U2L19M0VVCO5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "replaced a Toshiba 65 inch DLP tv when the light engine began to fail and I couldn't be happier.

Should be mated with a receiver and speakers to truly appreciate background music. I have not experienced the problems cited by others relative to picture quality. Very nice blacks, and reflections from the screen are minimal. Mounted the set over the fireplace, and when off it looks like a picture-when on it provides great HI-Def pictures. SD stations are above average. The yellow in this Quattron set appears to be more an advertising gimmick than a noticeable enhancement to the picture. No 3D, but I didn't want to spend considerably more for something with limited availability relative to programming, or movies. Off center viewing is not great, but in our case the mostly on center viewing resulted in a HD picture that is stunning in its clarity and color. Got a good price from AMAZON, and they did match an even lower price after the sale from one of the sellers they list for price matches. Shipping was fast, and the shipper did a good job getting it to me without damage.

Absolutely nothing to complain about so far.  I've had it for over a week and there just are not any problems.  I am happy I got it and would recommend it to friends. The only thing I would caution anybody about is the spotty telephone set-up support and registration that you don't really need. Skip it and register on-line. You can do it all on-line and it's easier and also less prone for errors in your address or name spelling.  Anyway, it's a great TV----great picture clear, bright, and sharp (pun not intended)---It has OK sound, stereo surround with built in subwoofer but could be better if you added a $599 Bose speaker system but you can wait for that, no hurry, it's fine as is.

Actually I have two HDTV monitors on my computer that I also watch TV on, so I had some experience with this media type, but for my living room I was replacing a 36\" Toshiba tube TV that was taking longer and longer to turn on, until one day it didn't anymore.For those who are coming from a tube world, let me set some expectations first.Yes, the picture will be brighter than your previous tv.Yes, the picture will be bigger than your previous tv.Yes the colors will be more vivid than your previous tvBUT be prepared to see negative aspects in your viewing that you never saw before on a tube tv. Non 1080p/i sources will look worse up close and the further down the resolution your source, the worse the image will look. I will be blocky especially around text. You will not get deep deep blacks, You will see haloing depending on picture content, you may have some flashlighting or visible edge lighting, you may see other picture artifacts especially in fast motion (with or without motion settings on the tv). You will experience audio and video sync problems if you run audio through an AV receiver. And the bigger the TV, the more many of these problems become apparent.All of these are things I knew to expect based on my computer tv monitoring experience, my visits to multiple stores to look at tvs, and my uncounted man hours of researching tv reviews, visiting av forums, creating comparison spreadsheets on every little technical details about them. As an engineer, I (over) analyze all the specs and detailed criteria before I purchase any electronics. I put some faith in reader reviews, but to me the Math comes first because not all readers user an item the exact way that I will, or even care about some feature etc.  If you don't know to expect this, you will be VERY disappointed, not specifically with this tv, but with ANY LCD/LED large tv. They ALL experience the same set of issues, some moreso then others.Having said all that - I did my research and settled on the best compromise tv I could find under my budget goal of $2500. When you read all the detailed technical reviews (not user reviews),  each tv has better this or a better that and each have the problem explained above. There is no perfect LED/LCD, at least not in that price range (and I don't think in any price range yet). At $1641 (Paul's tv fullfilled by amazon) in my opinion this was the best priced tv with the best compromise of LED/LCD issues, image quality etc. I had done my research on plasma too but the Panasonics were far too dim for my open living room (even in a dark showroom I thought they were too dim) and while I was a fan on the Samsung plasma on paper, they still experienced a brightness pop bug that had yet to be resolve by the time of my purchase. Also I had decided I really didn't want or care to have 3d at this time, so this model saved me some money (they sell a 3d version as well). I figure I'll let 3d become more mature, as well as the whole LED technology, then move this to the bedroom when that time comes and upgrade. Which was another goal not too spend too much money on a TV that potentially 5 years I would be switching out for a OLED TV or other technology.I find all the internet features on AV equipment these days a bit \"gadgety\". This tv has the basics most users need. My Panasonic blueray has more and some that are more interesting, but in truth I'll be doing all my computer surfing from my desktop anyway so it wasn't a decision point for me at all. In fact, if I could have saved a few bucks on a model that didn't have it, I would have.If you use 5.1/7.1 surround via AV receiver you need to know that this TV has about 100ms delay in the video processing (when some of the image processing settings are on, true of all the current model tvs out there though the amount of image delay varies) so you'll want a current receiver that supports audio delay. I had to retire my perfectly working non-hdmi Pioneer receiver for a new Denon AR-1612 that supports HDMI and audio delay (highly recommend this Deenon!) With that delay set in the receiver, you would never know there was a audio disconnect. (Note: For most tv's, I think actually all, if you use the sound from the tv via optical to the receiver there is no delay, but then you lose the ability to pipe 5.1 through the tv like via satellite or blueray source. Optical out from tv's only allows stereo unless from the internal tv tuner, copy protection basically. This is the case for all the brands that I know of).With all the above said, my wife and I really like this tv. I haven't fully calibrated it yet (waiting for some colors filters to arrive) but with other basic control settings the picture looks very good. Like many, I am not a fan of the soap opera effect on the film settings so I turn that off (again, not specific to this brand and a personal preference for sure).Delivery came when promised and they unboxed and setup on my stand. Couldn't have been a smoother delivery and that was one of my major concern areas having never bought something this large/delicate and delivered to my house.So am I sorry my 36\" tube is gone? Well I guess not. But I also didn't have a choice. I do love the bright 60\" size that I can see from across the room when eating dinner in the kitchen. I like the immersive picture when you are in the same room. I like the vivid color (doesn't mean the color is more \"accurate\" than my tube was, but definitely more vivid.) But when I see the typical LCD/LED picture artifacts (albiet infrequent) I think \"Gosh - I paid twice for this what I paid for my tube tv (12 years ago) and in many respects that picture was better\" you realize the technology just isn't perfected yet. Accept it. But given I had no choice but to get TV like this, I am very happy with the TV selection vs all the other brands and models I looked at this is, in my opinion the best solution for a (non 3d) HDTV under $2500. I it a great tv for the price given the limits of the technology today and I believe I made the right decision on the purchase of this tv.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "This Tv is Just Horrible...Once you see it", "Author": "Ryan Williams", "ReviewID": "R1JARUIZL2TKB1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After looking at every TV in town, I finally chose this model for it's outstanding picture quality.  After tweaking it in so it doesn't have that horrible \"camcorder effect\" where everything looks almost \"too sharp\"...I thought it was a fantastic TV until my girlfriend noticed something on the screen.  I could see it too, but just barely.  There was a shadow right in the middle of the screen that was in a weird cloud shape.  It didn't look too bad to me from the right side of the TV, but when I sat to the left of the TV, the shadow was huge and very 3D like.  After I saw that shadow, thats all i could focus on.  The shadow was only not noticeable if there was a dark color hiding it.  Then I noticed the strange little flashlights from the over-tightened screws on the top of the TV and I just couldn't stand to watch it anymore.  I also put several solid colors up on the screen to see how bad the shadow was...It was terrible and it was everywhere.  I just could not watch this TV because every time there was light colors on the screen, my eyes would focus on the shadow caused by the insufficient backlighting.  I gave up and traded it for the much larger 70\" model which has absolutely none of the backlight or flashlight effect issues that the 60\" has. It cost me an extra $900 for the huge 70\" screen that I really didn't need, but it was worth it because now I have the same great picture without the horrible shadows on the screen.  I would say, do not buy this TV because you will want to return it same as I did.  Either save up for the larger TV or get another brand 60\" TV.  I also read that others having the same issue had their TV replaced by SHARP and the replacement TV had the same shadow/backlighting issues.  Also...do not opt for the 240Hz models because that feature is the first thing turned off by it's owners for compatibility issues.  I have the 120Hz model and have no issues with lag or jitter on moving objects.  You'll still want to turn some of the features off like auto adjusting gamma and such, because they really ruin the picture on this TV.

Turned out this TV was on closeout at Fr&$ at $999.99, yes, about $1,700 off!  Was hoping that Amazon would match that price as I much prefer doing business with Amazon.  This is a great LED HDTV.  Don't let the plasma-geeks fool you...yes, plasmas are nice, but they are not the end-all of HDTV's.  Most of those folks are simply trying to justify their plasma purchases.  This Sharp LC60LE830U can look as good, or better, than any plasma or other technology currently available, if adjusted correctly.  I first tried the configuration settings noted in another review here.  They didn't seem to make my unit shine.  So I played quite a bit and got it looking much sharper and more to my tastes.  Will post the settings I used soon.  Sharp really has an excellent replacement in the marketplace today.  After looking at so many HDTV's, I could not see where Sony and Samsung really deserved the premium price in todays HDTV marketplace.  I was a big Sony fan, until now.  Glad I looked at LG and Sharp too.  Their on-line reviews are really good, and their HDTV's seem to be as good, or better, than Sony and Samsung.  And there seemed to be less negative reviews of Sharp, in particular.  Yea, I got a great deal on this LC60LE830U, and hope you can too.  But even at it's current price, it's a real value in an excellent HDTV, with an exceptional picture, and plenty of useful features.  Oh, yea, I really liked their configuration/settings menu and method.  You can get on each individual setting and see how it changes the picture, dynamically, as you are adjusting them.  Sure, most HDTV's allow you to do that, but what stands out is that the Sharp gives you a mostly full picture display with a minimized config \"bar\" and doesn't take up most of the picture as you're playing with the settings.

S/H was free since I'm a Amazon Prime member.  Received in 3-5 business days.  Delivery company called me in advance to schedule delivery time.  The two men removed the top of the box, plugged in the TV to a power source and checked to make sure there was a snowy picture.  THEY DO NO ATTACH BASE TO TV, NOR DO THEY REMOVE TV FROM BOX.  Since I live alone, I asked a neighbor for help getting the TV set up on the stand.  IT TAKES TWO PEOPLE TO LIFT TV FROM BOX.  I registered the TV online so Sharp extended my warranty for 3 extra months.  Since the TV won't fit in my car, I paid for a 3-year extended warranty from Sharp.  This made $ense to me. (I now have 49 months warranty)I have a WIFI Modum with my computer, and it talks to the TV from another room.  I've had 2 software upgrades to my TV since the beginning, and it only takes a few minutes to download software upgrades to the TV.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this purchase.  Thanks Amazon.

However, within 3 months, and after being used infrequently, it developed a red line in the monitor from the top to the bottom of the screen.We called Sharp service to repair it.  They insisted on exchanging it for a refurbished TV.  We made a special trip to our vacation home to exchange the TV.When we opened the box for the replacement TV, the refurbished TV was damaged - it had been assembled incorrectly and the front panel was coming apart from the back half of the shell that encases the monitor itself.I've purchased TV's from Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba, Vizio and others, and I've never seen such shoddy workmanship, especially in what Sharp considers to be their better TV.

One minor complaint is that these new smart TVs with built-in internet will search for updates automatically.

I just picked it up yesterday and set it up.I have been astounded that the television got a low rating on cNet from the professionals.  When I compared all the other televisions side by side at retailers, the Sharp image quality really jumped out at me.  When a non-Blue Ray version of Star Wars was playing on a Samsung Blu Ray player, the image quality blew me away.  The best comparison I can give people is this:  The image quality looks like that of your local hi definition news station.  I don't know if that's the yellow pixel in action or what, but you'd almost think you are seeing \"behind the scenes\" type docu-footage.I have yet to try a \"real\" blue ray movie in yet but anxious to try.For settings, I have been toying with the settings discussed on the AVS ForumsBig TV, will be wall mounting for sure in a few weeks....after the savings account recharges a bit!", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a very good price", "Author": "Thomas Steinruck \"tugboat tom\"", "ReviewID": "R17M4CPTM5L6AC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a replacement for my aging 57\" rear projection set.

I have a receiver and speakers but have not hooked them up yet. The only mistake I made was I had it mounted on the wall before I got the serial number off of the back. But since it is internet ready and grabbed right on my wireless router I hope that they can find the serial number by snooping in the TV.

Any navigation problems that I have had is due to my own lack of knowledge but I am learning.I do not get that flashback that others have complained about on other brands.

I would not dare state how much I got this set at the end. I think others would get jealous. haha...Amazon's customer service has been top notch to try and compensate me for any issues and would usually have a solution for any issue. After all of it,  I don't think I would've found a better deal with quattron technology.This is a beautiful and slim tv set. I do not know why people would not have sharp in the same class as samsung, sony or panasonic. Must be a type of person that only buys something since it is \"popular\" and does not know that they are just paying for the name brand. When watching a video in HD quality you feel as if you are there. I did catch myself getting a bit dizzy since it was so lifelike. I did find that my setting preference was the GAME MODE not only for gaming but also for watching movies since it was brighter and had a better quality than the MOST HELPFUL comment with calibration recommendations, but to each their own.I am glad I picked this tv than the other sharp aquos 60\" or another brand named 55\".
