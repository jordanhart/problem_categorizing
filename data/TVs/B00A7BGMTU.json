Well, I ended buying 3 of them for the kids & guest rooms. Setup seems to be quite easy and accessories was complete. As with all new electronic equipment, figuring out the new remote is always a bit of challenge but my 2 younger kids seems no problem hooking up to their XBox. The Remote is convenient as it controls the TV as well as the DVD player. The built-in DVD player as it save some counter space.The TV also comes with a Screwdriver to attach the TV Stand to the TV. That was convenient. The sound is just ok but I plan to hook up a External SoundBar to the TV. The color is not bad at all and there is different settings for the color according to your liking. Well so far so good and hope the TV will be around for some time.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ocosmo 32\" tv's", "Author": "aces600 \"Alexander Morales\"", "ReviewID": "R2LTG0MIYJBDKL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "ok so i was a bit worried on these, they where really priced low when i got them and i bought 3 for the kids room because of the built in dvds. gotta tell you they look great and work as described. i mounted them on the wall and havent had any problems with the tv or dvd player. use the sony codes when programming a cable or satellite controller. very pleased with this purchase", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "Paul Thomann", "ReviewID": "R3QIER1XJY46JE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this LED TV for our new RV 5th wheeler and I love it.

I called Sceptre, the maker of the TV, and they told me that the warranty does not cover cracked screens regardless of it being internal. At the time, the TV was $224.

Ok for the price but some annoying \"features\" which, although they do not irritate me enough to return it, if I had known about them beforehand I would not have bought it.1. Audio volume calibrated too high - even the very lowest volume setting before silence is too loud - at the lowest setting I can still hear the tv from other rooms.  I tried every combination of audio settings available but lowest setting is still too loud.  So I finally hooked up my computer speakers for better control of low volume.2.  There are several pre-set video schemes with different combinations of brightness/contrast/color etc.  However the differences between the schemes is so small as to make them useless, and you are not allowed to edit them.  You are only allowed to edit the one \"user\" scheme.  Similar complaint for the pre-set audio schemes.3.  \"ocosmo\" logo splash screen every time you turn it on4.  Although there is a sleep timer, there are apparently no program timers.  You can't set it to wake up and play a chosen channel for a specified amount of time or automatically switch to another channel at a certain time.  The Samsung has program timers and I miss being able to do this on the ocosmo.5.  There doesn't seem to be a way to manually add individual channels - you have to repeat the entire channel scan and then again go through re-marking which channels you want skipped and which to set as favorites.On the plus side, the picture looks good when displaying HD broadcasts and I haven't had any problems using the DVD player as other reviewers have.

It sounded really small initially, but we got used to it quickly and it's more than adequate for the bedroom which we purchased it for.  I've only used the DVD player once so far (had it for two weeks), but it worked fine when I did.  Keep in mind that you have to set the source to DVD in order for the DVD to go in.  I didn't know this and thought it was broken at first; almost broke it myself by trying to force the disc in!  I docked this TV one star because there is a light green (or white) fading in the upper left corner.  It's only visible when it's black and doesn't affect the picture, but it shouldn't be there.
