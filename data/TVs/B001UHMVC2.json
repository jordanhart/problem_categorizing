The physical TV is gorgeous, but unfortunately it has issues with the screen that I couldn't live with.During normal viewing (in the store, in a lit room during the day), the picture quality is awesome - it has inky blacks and vibrant colors. The problem has to do with its \"screen uniformity\", something I didn't even know was a \"feature\" to consider when I was researching TVs.This TV has an \"edge-lit LED screen\", which means the LED lights are along the edges of the screen shining inwards toward the center. Unfortunately, this makes for very uneven lighting across the screen. It's not noticeable during the day, but at night in a dark room watching a dark scene, there were a number of faint glowing streaks coming from the edges of the screen. It was very apparent in the letterboxing (the black bands over and below a widescreen image), in which there were feint cones of light coming from the corners of the screen.I researched the issue (I searched for the TV's model number and the words \"screen uniformity\") and it turns out this is an issue all the LEDs have. The review sites offer the technical explanations for it.I'm by no means a A/V snob, but the problem was almost instantly noticed by me and everyone I had look at the TV.I returned the TV and instead purchased the Samsung LN46B650 Samsung LN46B650 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color. It costs almost $600 less, has just as gorgeous of a picture (I don't notice the contrast ratio difference), and has none of the screen uniformity issues.I'll say that again - the NON-LED 46'' Samsung TV has a BETTER quality picture and costs hundreds of dollars less. Unless you are using this TV in a lit room during the day and you value only the aesthetics of such a thin TV, go with the regular LCD. You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "More with less", "Author": "Paul Moskowitz", "ReviewID": "R2TSPPT84D7CKV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My requirement for a television is quite simple: plug it in to the cable box and have it work the first time; then turn on the sports event of the day, e.g. Mets or Yankees, Jets or Giants, etc.  The Samsung 46 inch LED TV does that very well.  You plug it in, it works.This TV does more with less.  It weighs only about 40 pounds plus another 10 pounds for the stand.  Compare that with the older Samsung 950 model of the same size which weighs 70 pounds.  The elegant stand allows for easy rotation.  The TV is only a little over one inch thick!  Power consumption has been measured by reviewers at about 105 watts.  The 950 model comes in at 180 watts.The picture is great. The contrast ratio, rated at 3,000,000 to 1, exceeds that of older LCD TVs. The black areas are dark and the picture has an almost 3D quality.  There are four preset picture options. I chose the \"normal\" setting. The next higher setting, \"standard\", makes infield grass look almost dayglow. I do not think that there is a need to have any further adjustment done on the picture.  However, there is an automatic dimming of the overall brightness for dark scenes.  For instance, when the credits of a movie run against a black background the lettering becomes dimmer.  This has no effect on sports, but does effect dark movie scenes.The screen surface does reduce reflections but does not eliminate them entirely.  The black frame is shiny and does also reflect some light.  Rotating the screen to the best angle helps.The remote provides choices for four picture size variations.  I use \"16:9\" for the HD format or \"wide\" to make the non-HD, 4:3, video fill the screen.  That loses some of the 4:3 picture at the top and bottom edges, but the picture quality is still good.The sound also has four preset choices.  Although, the internal speakers are not bad, I decided to use my sound system for the audio.  The TV has an audio output connection, but the TV remote volume control only allows variation in the sound level for the internal speakers.  The audio output stays at a constant level.  I got around this by taking the audio from my cable box directly to my sound system and controlling the level with the cable remote.  This works.Although Samsung provides a version of the instruction manual on a USB drive with the TV, I found it easy to download and print a pdf of the manual from the Samsung support center.  Having the printed manual is helpful. (See my comment for the web address of the support center.)After one month, I still really like this TV.  It is great for sports. An added bonus is that my electric bill has actually gone down.Note that there is a similiar 7000 model.  The 7000 model differs from the 6000 model in its I/O capabilities. Recently some people have reported that the 7000 has a better picture.  If you do not need the extras, go with the 6000 and save a few dollars.", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "My first HDTV", "Author": "David Courtney \"blixel\"", "ReviewID": "R1NTFAOND93F13", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to start off by warning everyone that this is my first HDTV ever, so I have nothing to compare it to other than regular old school 4:3 CRT televisions.I bought this TV Friday, May 8th, 2009.The main thing about this Samsung TV is that the picture is unbelievably rich and vibrant! (So much so that it takes a little getting use to.) The clarity is so good that it is actually distracting to me. (Though I'm sure I'll get use to it.) But as an example, I was re-watching Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl and I couldn't stop noticing the lines on the actors' faces, individual blades of grass, creases in fabric, and all sorts of other subtle details long enough to pay attention to the actual movie! OK - so maybe that is more of a general HDTV thing and has less to do with the Samsung TV? I don't know. Again - this is my first HDTV ever.The Samsung TV is incredibly thin. This was one of the things that really drew my attention to this TV when I was doing my comparative shopping. Flat panel TV's are an order of magnitude thinner than their larger CRT cousins, but this Samsung TV takes the thinness to a whole new level.I've read that this particular TV uses less power than standard flat panel TV's. While I'm not a tree-hugging hippie, I do prefer to be a good steward of the planet whenever possible. But more practical is the fact that less power consumption = less heat generated. I live in Florida so I prefer electronics that don't radiate lots of heat.The integrated speakers are functional, but I can't imagine anyone would spend this much money on a TV and be satisfied with the integrated speakers. I'm not taking points off the review for the relatively lousy speakers because I believe lousy speakers are par for the course with flat panel TV's. (Or TV's in general really. Even CRT TV's have pretty lousy built-in speakers.) If you really want a high quality audio experience, you know you're going to have to use external speakers.I can't say much about the input options. I bought a Samsung Blu-ray player at the same time I got the TV and I got an HDMI cable to hook up between the two devices. It \"just worked.\" The Samsung TV / Blu-ray player seem to be a good match. When I put in a DVD or Blu-ray disc, the TV turns on automatically and switches to the correct HDMI input. But otherwise I don't have any devices plugged into this TV yet. I don't have cable or satellite or a video game system.I would suggest that anyone who buys this TV should try to put the TV in a room without any windows or bright lights facing it. I bought this TV for my bedroom and it sits about 12 feet directly in front of my bedroom window. Fortunately the window is on the backside of the house and has a thick blind over it, otherwise I think the reflection from the window would be overwhelming during the day.The TV is certainly bright and vibrant enough to watch in daylight conditions, that's not the issue. The issue is the amount of reflection on the TV screen. During the day, I can see the reflection from the edge of my window. It's fairly subtle and I can easily address this by buying a decorative curtain to place over my window, but it is something that I think is worth pointing out. If you know you're going to have your TV in front of a big window, it could be a major distraction if you can't cover the window properly.", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Tyron \"v3battleangel\"", "ReviewID": "R6JZ36JR2PSIR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this Television! Amazing picture quality, easy to configure with some great presets. I purchased this TV from Best Buy and had it delivered the next few days. When I bought it, it was slightly cheaper than what was being offered on Amazon, but since, the Amazon price has been updated to be cheaper. It's amazing to me how quickly the prices on these TVs are dropping.The only problem I have with the TV and the reason I only gave it 4 stars is the automatically adjusting backlight feature. When the picture is bright, the contrast is amazing, but when the image is dark, the TV dims the backlight so the blacks are blacker. The only problem with this approach is everything gets darker and the contrast goes to hell. This usually isn't a problem and mostly noticeable on credits which isn't a huge deal. I would think you would be able to turn this feature off, but Samsung doesn't allow for that. If anyone knows how to turn it off, I would be very interested in knowing.Everything else is amazing. Contrast ratio (when the picture is bright) is outstanding, blacks are pitch and the whites seem bright enough to burn your eyes. For easy setup, I recommend the Dynamic setting for the best contrast. Colors seem brilliant and sharp. This setting turns the backlight to 10 which is normally set at 5 on the default settings. Not sure why 5 is the default, it causes the picture to look kind of washed out. I would think that Samsung would want you to be impressed the moment you turned the TV on without any adjustment.I use Windows Media Center as my primary interface so I have a computer connected to the TV via HDMI. For proper clarity on computer text, you will need to turn the sharpness setting down. The edge enhancement defaults cause super small details like computer text to become washed out. The sharpness feature works very well for HD movies though.The 120hz Automotion Plus is a quirky feature at best. I have found uses for the different settings depending on the media type. By default the Automotion plus is set to Normal which effectively doubles your framerate by interpolating middle frames(it's magic). A 24 fps signal will show 48 fps and a 60 fps signal will show 120 fps. While this sounds good in theory, the final output is not necessarily all that pleasing. One of the qualities of films, something that give movies a distinctive look from video is the lower frame rate. Movies are filmed at 24 fps and doubling that framerate makes it feel more like video than film IMHO. The interpolation process also isn't perfect. Fast moving scenes can create some unusual anomalies in the picture. People running against a moving backdrop can sometimes seem to have a distortion surrounding them. Not sure if this distortion is coming from the interpolation or artifacts in the Blu-ray video compression, but it's distracting and only noticable with the Automotion turned on. It's not a total loss though, some settings can be useful depending on the source material. I found with Blu-ray and computer animation the Normal setting provides a great effect, giving the impression of a real time rendered output. Wall-E with Automotion Plus is amazing. For standard filmed movies, I recommend the Clear setting, which maintains the 24 fps, but uses the extra frame interpolation to sharpen the blur of fast moving objects. I recommend turning it off for Video games and television. Any anomalies in the picture, such as vertical refresh image tearing in games or mpeg image compression artifacts by cable or satellite are only exasperated by Automotion plus.I haven't used any of the Media playing abilities of the TV as I have a computer connected to it. Windows 7 handles all of my media playback needs. I highly recommend taking this approach to media playback and purchasing the 6000 model which is quite a bit cheaper, but lacks some of the more advanced network media playback features. While the 7000 and 8000 have some nice online features, it can't beat a computer. Windows 7/Vista also allows you to scale up the user interface dpi while maintain the 1080p resolution for easy viewing with a super sharp picture.All in all, my recommendation is to buy this TV. Better contrast than plasma with the clarity of LCD. Can't beat that. I am sure that Samsung plans to release a 240hz version of the television with a more expensive price tag, but I don't recommend it. Automotion plus is kind of neat, but its gimmicky more than anything else.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV!! If you can accept severe edge light bleeding and white light streaks from the corners", "Author": "Bhairav H.

I work in display and LED illumination industry for last 5 years now and know a lot about display physics and image/color science. Picture and performance of this TV is phenomenal. I havnt seen any display that can reproduce so many colors, darkest black level, millions to 1 in contrast ratio and shades of grey. I loved this TV the first week. I watches 10s of movies in Blu Ray HD resolution and enjoyed it. Normal Cable TV in normal resolution looked worse than my old CRT TV. So this TV needs all HD broadcast for the picture to look good.After a week or so this TV started showing edge light bleeding on all black/dark scenes and bleeding kept on getting worse from the edge as the week went by. Eventually I started observing white light streaks from the corners of the TV going towards the center of the screen. Full color scenes were great but once the black screen comes I see severe light bleeding from edges and corners that was very non uniform. I talked to Samsung Customer Service and they said that it is common and is there in all TVs and that is how the design is. I talked to sales people at Fry's retail store and they also told me that it is very common and they have observed it too and we will have to live with it.After 3 weeks of unsuccessful calibration and color tuning efforts...Sadly I had to return the TV back to Fry's retailer. I really loved this TV. The picture quality and overall performance was phenomenal but I can not accept severe light bleeding and corner light streaks so I returned it. I will get standard LCD or LED backlit (not edge lit) TV soon if I can find one that fits my budget....Think about the above points before making decision on buying this TV and paying extra for this LED TV.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "The perfect TV?", "Author": "Michael O'Brien", "ReviewID": "R2UCANS853V1TE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:* Contrast almost makes the image look 3D (3,000,000:1 contrast ratio)* Vibrant colors* Ultra-Green -- uses almost no power (40% less than an LCD) and uses no mercury in production.* Very easy setup* Clean design* Great remoteCons:* Can only take 1 component video connection* Although I use my receiver for sound, the built-in speaker does not sound great.* Not really a con but they have an RJ-45 port for a network cable, but don't have wifi -- if it is going to be networkable, wifi is so much easier to set up.Summary:Last week my wife and I finally upgraded our Dish Network to HD.

I was waiting for the price to drop so I could buy 46inch LCD 1080p for my bedroom. recently I went to local store and checked out some 46inch tv's with 60Hz priced around $1200. I went to check out the qualities, I immediated noticed big difference between 60Hz and 120Hz. I didn't know the difference would be that big of a deal but when the camera was moving, that's when I could tell the big difference. I came back home and researched some more. Most 46inch with  120Hz were around $1600 or more. I went back to store and compared, and I saw this one TV with outstanding picture which was Samsung LED 46. It was definitely over my budget, but I couldn't resist. I came back home and researched and found out that LED has many advantages (40% less electricity than LCD, longer life time that it can be viewed over 100,000 hours, thinner, better contrast and so on). So I bought this.It's been 3 weeks now, and now, I love my room more than I ever did. I don't wanna talk about all the merits of this LED that everyone already knows. One thing I didn't know when I was researching was that this unit can play many types of movie files (.avi (divx and xvid), mp4, mpeg, .mkv, and many more and your firmware can be upgraded for the future movie codec)I have many files that are .avi and .mkv with the size over 2gb that are blu-ray ripped. Those big .mkv files play without any problem and near blu-ray quality.I also figured that this unit works with any USB external hard drive as well as USB memory. I tried my 1TB seagage external hard drive with power adapter, 500GB portable WD hard drive without adapter, and it worked like a charm.I checked the electricity consumtion with my P2 gauge, and it was measured between 85 - 110 watts.I know this LED is edge technology type of LED that some say it's not a true LED, and LG's new model is true LED, but that will consume more electricity and that is thicker and heavier than this one.Also some of you are waiting for OLED to come out, but that will be at least 4-5 years and the price will be toooo high.This Samsung LED is without a doubt, the best quality TV out there in the market, and if you don't mind spending $4-500 more, that's good investment you won't regret", "Date": "May 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "If you're debating between less glossy Sony and thinner, glossier Samsun, read on...", "Author": "A. Burns", "ReviewID": "R3BDXSLKVDPPSM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased a Sony 52\" 52Z5100 LCD television.  Ultimately, I ended up exchanging it for the Samsung on this page.  Why? Well, read on.First, I had a 42\" LCD projection 720p. Nice picture but time to upgrade.  I always disliked glossy screened models but drooled over the thinness of the Samsung LED's.  At Best Buy, I looked at all the TV's.  I didn't care about 240hz b/c it's not a noticable difference over 120hz, so I was considering many displays.  I kept coming back to the Sony 52Z5100 ($1899) and the Samsung UN46B6000 ($1839.)  I know Sony makes good displays and I was worried about the glossiness so I purchased it and had it delivered.  When I got it hooked up I was impressed but I never could quite get the picture they had in the store that was almost 3D.  I know part of that is b/c they have all the settings pushed real high in-store, but even when I did that I couldn't get it.  Now, don't get me wrong, it looked really good and I was really thinking of keeping it.  But every time I looked at it from the side it just seemed a little bulky.  The other issue I was having was the brightness.  Even with the backlight turned to 1 and brightness turned down low, the display was too bright.  It was fine when watching a show but if a commercial came on with a white background it sometimes hurt my eyes.  It was that bright.  Some would view that as a good thing but I constantly found myself adjusting the backlight and brightness.  I can't say I wasn't satisfied with the display but after 3 weeks I found myself still considering the Samsung and I saw that as a sign that I should exchange it.Having had the Samsung for 2 weeks now I am happy that I made the exchange.  The glossiness, while not ideal on a bright day, isn't that bad.  In fact, I would say that if this TV didn't have the glossy screen it would be almost perfect.  The extreme brightness on the Sony tended to wash colors out a little...something I didn't really notice until viewing the Samsung.  Colors were much more saturated.  Some people have mentioned uneven lighting with the Samsung.  I have looked hard for it and as picky as I am I can't see it at all.  The sound is also very acceptable...much better than I expected, and that's nice since I don't always want to play it through my stereo.  The Samsung also gives you more control over its settings than the Sony did.  Perhaps that's why I could never get the Sony to exactly where I wanted it.  The only negative I would give this TV is the motion control settings.  Honestly, my favorite is usually off.  I don't see much blur at all with it off.  Putting it on Smooth, Clear, Standard, or even Custom with the blur on 10 and judder on 0 can look somewhat artificial at times.  For instance, I replayed a scene on my DVR using all the settings.  During this scene the camera pans across a bunch of people sitting on a bus.  While smooth looked kind of neat, it created a little \"jump\" or judder at one portion of the pan.  In fact, all the settings except off did this. (I also tried custom with judder at various settings.)  Now, many people wouldn't even notice this and by no means does it ruin the experience, I'm just left with the feeling that this whole 120hz and 240hz is much ado about nothing.  Like I said, turning it off is fine...even when watching football.To sum up, by no means do I mean to imply the Sony is a bad TV - far from it.  If you have recently bought one you have a very good TV with a beautiful picture.  Just for me, preference wise, I prefer the Samsung.  I love the thinness and deeper color saturation.  Now, perhaps if I sat further from the TV (I'm at 11ft) or had this in a room with windows facing the TV (mine are to the side of it) I may feel differently.  It all comes down to personal preference when you're talking about TV's of this caliber, so hopefully I've just provided a little more for you to help you decide which is for you.

I guess the price isn't that big an issue when spread over the several years that I'll have this TV. The TV is in a large living room / dining room with high ceilings with two skylights. The room is very bright during the day, but the picture hold it's own, bright and no glare. With Blue Ray and HD cable, the picture is incredable. It does take some getting used to, it's somewhat distracting at first. I see none of the light pumping or motion blur as mentioned in some reviews. Yes, the sound sucks.

Normally it works like a charm, but it can be a bit of a nuisance when you're in the middle of a dark scene in a video game, trying to find something.I checked around, and this seems to be a common annoyance.  I've heard rumors that Samsung might release a software update which would include the option to turn this feature off in the OSD menu.  I am all for this!The AutoMotion Plus feature has 4 settings: Clear(low), Standard(medium), Smooth(high), and Off.  I keep it on \"Clear\".  This seems to get rid of any blurring, yet avoid making the picture look fake.  Most movies and TV shows are filmed at 24fps (frames per second).  If you speed that up to faster than it was originally shot, it starts to look artificial.  This annoys me.  The only times I turn on the \"smooth\" setting are during Live Sports and Nature Shows (ie. Planet Earth on Blu-Ray!).  Those types of shows are shot at 30fps, which matches up better with the 120Hz refresh rate known as \"Smooth\".Hope this helps!But just to reiterate.... THIS TV IS AMAZING!Oh, and to those of you complaining about the sound quality of the built-in speakers... The TV is 1\" thick!  Just what do you realistically expect?  That's like complaining about the sound quality of the speakers in your cellphone.  Seriously.... if you're going to invest this much in a TV, pony up and get a 5.1 system.

When we found out my first TV choice was delayed for an unknown amount of time he didn't want to wait and got this B6000 (instead of the 8000) on Amazon. Here are some issues I've seen with the TV.1. Motion blurI've noticed ridiculous motion blur or ghosting with this TV. I was quite appalled by it. I've adjusted settings fruitlessly (there isn't that much to adjust) to no avail. This is all coming in on the satellite feed and while it is a 120hz TV I noticed the incoming signal always says 1920x1080 60hz. I can't get it to change from there. In the end it may just be the satellite box (Dish DVR). Perhaps someone else can confirm this in the comments.2. LED Edge-litI would stay away from edge-lit TVs for now. If you're wall mounting and you MUST have an ultra thin TV then go for it. But if you want excellent screen uniformity then you'll want to avoid it.3. ControlsThe amount of picture adjustment controls seems very limited.4. GLOSSY SCREEN!I don't know why manufacturers are making TV's with glossy screen. I can only guess that it costs significantly less to make than a matte screen. You can see every bit of light reflecting in this screen. If you like to have a light on while you're watching TV, make sure the light is right above/behind the TV or it's behind you and you're sitting off to the side. Otherwise you'll be plenty annoyed on any dark/semi-dark scene. On the bright scenes you don't really notice it.On a more positive note:Through Blu-Ray it looks very amazing. In fact, perhaps too good. Several movies I've watched on Blu-Ray actually are so crisp and sharp that it looks like a movie set instead of a real life scene. That ruins it a tiny bit for me. The best example would be Dark Knight.The motion blur has made me think poorly of this TV. I do hope it's just something to do with Dish's DVR box. But if it only does 60hz on all boxes, why bother? My brother has a slightly older model Samsung 120hz 52\" that looks great over Brighthouse.

I read some other reviews saying there were annoying lines at the sides of the television when watching in a dark environment, and I have to dismiss that completely. Perhaps they had a faulty unit or something, because I don't get that problem at all. This television provides super vibrant colors, and it's just amazing to watch football on (in HD, of course). I use this both in the daytime and at night, and my two complaints are this: 1) This television is super glossy. So much that it really catches a lot of reflections (off windows, lights, etc.). Since this is an issue with almost every television, this is probably just something to consider when placing it in a room. 2) This television sometimes grays whites out. Now, we all know the problem with LCDs - getting deeper blacks. Plasmas don't have this problem, but LCDs do because they're backlit by fluorescents. These Samsung LED televisions don't have this problem because they use LED backlighting to achieve truly deep blacks. I've only noticed this when there is a black screen with white text, but in such a scenario, the white text sort of greys out. It's not terribly bad, but it it noticeable. In all other conditions, this television is fine, though.I also use this television for gaming. Absolutely perfect picture quality there, too. I actually had a minor issue where there was a tight text scroll going across the bottom of the screen (Battlefield 1943), and the bottoms of some of the letters (mostly Ms, Ns, etc.) were running together. This was a small problem, but mildly annoying. Anyway, I switched the television to Game Mode, and that cleared up immediately.

I have been told this is a problem with all hd tvs, so you may want to do your own research on this.  I think it is a big enough issue to at least make people aware of.  The picture quality is unbelievable on hd programing and hd upconverted dvds, but standard def. picture quality is worse than my old edtv I replaced.  It looks very pixelated and has many artifacts around edges and outlines.  If you watch alot of standard def. you may want to hold off on an hdtv purchase until most channels are broadcast in high def.

I had seen it in a store before I purchased it, and in the store it blew the other TVs around it away.Having used this TV for about 2 weeks, I can safely say that it has in many ways lived up to my expectation.  The color is true to life, the contrast excellent.  Motion is seemless, and watching blue-ray movies on the TV is exquisite, and this is with out of the box settings!  I have also played many hours of video games on this TV, and the image is mind blowing.  My wife was astounded the first time I booted up our Xbox 360, saying \"I'll never play video games on your computer again!\" - Not sure if I am happy or sad about that one...  Even for action games and FPS's this TV has had seemless visuals with no bluring, slowdown, or anything else I've heard negative about LCD/LED TV's.  Many people complain that LEDs tend to have a washed out white \"halo\" around the outer rim of their TV, due to the way that the LED \"side-lights\" the display (in contrast to the \"back-light\" of an LCD TV.  I use this TV in my basement with no other lighting, this is the worst possible scenario for these issues, and I almost never notice a problem.  The only time I do notice this is if the lights are off and the screen is pure black (credits to a movie).  Otherwise I can't say I notice this AT ALL.My complaints about the devices are these:1) It isn't true 120hz2) Isn't best bang for the buckThis TV claims to be 120hz, but is really 60hz with \"auto-motion plus,\" a feature that digitally inserts extra frames based on some sort of average of the current and next frame.  This creates an artificial 120hz.  I've found this system to be great for high quality images, as it gives me a fluid and realistic feel, which is almost creepy.  On the other hand, this technology doesn't always do the images favors, and I've found when this technology is applied to standard definition video the effect is less then desirable.  It is almost as if the feature accents problems with the image, making poor lighting and non-fluid movement obvious.  That said, you can turn the feature off, but its burried in a complex menu system, and is a pain to toggle.  I bought this TV thinking it was true 120hz, but I was wrong.  Still, even with true-motion  turned off action scenes are without skip, and look great.My last and final complaint is that for the price this TV is quite as nice as I would have hoped.  If it were a true 120hz this TV would be a 5 star purchase, but what you are really paying for is the LED factor, and not for the other features.  All in all the interface, remote, and construction is top notch.  Performance is admirable, but the TV is expensive, and I've seen LCD tvs for hundreds less that can compete with this TV in most departments.A definite buy if you must have an LED TV.

I only see a black screen during this delay. I'm using a HDMI cable that came with the directv box, to connect to the tv. I'm ordering a new HDMI 1.3b cable to see if this will resolve the issue. Anyone with a solution to this?", "Date": "May 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Reminds Me When We First Got Cable....", "Author": "John A. Oathout \"RebateKing\"", "ReviewID": "RU3N5XS2018FS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 46 and I remember when I was a kid, Mom bought cable.  To go from four channels to 40 was a revolution and I remember sitting around for the next few days doing not much else but watching cable TV programming.  I'm afraid the experience with this new HDTV is going to be similar.  The experience, once again, is revolutionary.  My what a difference a decade makes.  That's when we bought our 42\" Sony TV for the living room for just about the same price as this baby.  Excellent picture my friend, but the picture you get from this TV is beyond that...I can't imagine how it can get any better.The first thing you MUST do before you purchase this TV is to MAKE SURE you have an HD compatible cable box.  Call your provider - they'll know if you do or not. We didn't.  The picture was good on conventional channels but certainly wasn't as fantastic as HD is.  So I ran out the door and 15 minutes later returned with the HD cable box.  5 minutes later I was up to speed.  No charge for the box or the HD channels either.  (Cox...you're the BOMB!)  I'm pretty certain now that \"HD\" stands for \"Hot DAMN!....look at that picture!\"  It's unbelievable.  It's almost 3D.  You really DO feel like you are there - or that whoever IS there on the boob tube is coming into your living room.  SpongeBob never looked so square.....dew on blades of grass, stubble on Survivorman's chin, you name it - crystal clear.Here's yet another surprise.  We have an as-old-as-the-hills DVD player and it is the honest to God truth that your older DVDs WILL look world's better on this TV.  We've got ours connected through component cables and man, what a great picture!  Got a blue ray player that I haven't connected yet because we don't have the HDMI cable to give us the best picture.Speaking of cables.  Check online for better prices than the ridiculous $60 a pop they foist on you at the big electronics stores for a 4 foot job.  I found three - count em' three - 6 foot, gold plated, cables that yes, were the same rating as the $60 cable for the whopping price of $10 shipped.  Where?  Right here on good ole' Amazon.  Other similar deals abound.I also purchased the wireless network dongle.  So far, works as advertised.  Internet access through the TV - though as far as I can tell - not exactly like surfing on a PC - and I can share my pictures folder on my laptop and view those on the TV too.  However, it doesn't look like I can wirelessly send the actual laptop display to the TV - that would have been nice - and I'll bet it's not long before something of that nature is available.  WARNING:  Don't hook up this TV directly to your computer!  If you do?  You'll be thinking how to get a 46 inch monitor for every PC in the house!  Incredible display.

The stunning picture seems to me equally impressive regardless of the level of light in the room. I appreciate the review from the customer who posted his information and recommended to buy the LCD instead of the LED, but I simply have not been able detect the problem that made him return the TV. I also respect but disagree with the person who made the remarks about the bad quality of sound, and recommended not buying the sound bar. I got my TV at Best Buy and the deal I found included the sound bar with the wireless sub-woofer for free.The TV speakers sound to me just fine, nice volume without distortion, and in combination with the sound bar the sound is as good as it gets without a full-featured high-end home theater system.My only bad experience with this TV happened while connecting the sound bar to the TV using the supplied optical cable. The supplied cable was so short that it barely allowed the connection, and forced it to fold sharply, because the audio port on the sound bar is on the end most distant from where it is on the TV (clearly a design mismatch from Samsung). But the real problem came when sliding the optical jack into the fragile port behind the TV. Even though I was careful, I could hear a snap, and noticed that the tiny door in the optical receptacle broke off. I suspect that it may have been broken from the start, but perhaps it broke while I was making the connection. The result was a faulty connection that caused the sound bar's volume to go up and down. I had to use tape to keep the optical cable aligned in place, because the broken receptacle would not hold the optical jack firmly in place. For this reason, I brought back the TV to the store and got a replacement. This time I bought a longer optical cable and made the connection with even more care, very very slowly. I heard a click, and this time nothing was broken and the cable stayed in place. I'm now enjoying my TV with no sound problems. The sound bar not only greatly enhances the TV's sound, but also looks great, as it matches the TV's classy Touch of Color edge look. The wireless sub-woofer is not very powerful (although it is quite large and heavy) but it does help to provide a sense of bass and surround sound, as I placed it on the opposite corner of the room from the TV. It automatically connects without wires every time the sound bar is turned on.I think that this TV along with its sound bar and sub-woofer will be a keeper. The positive by far outweighs the negative. I definitely recommend it, just be extremely careful when connecting that optical cable.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nothing is perfect but this is close", "Author": "Donald H.

It almost seems 3D at times, it is by far the best picture I have ever seen on a TV. Watching BluRay is breathtaking. I have a surround sound system so the speaker issues people talk about are lost on me, I can't imagine having a picture like this without complementing it with surround sound, it would be like buying a hot car with an AM radio in it.A couple of drawbacks, the power light that appears in the clear neck of the base is very annoying in particular when watching a movie in letterbox, it almost draws your eye away from the picture. I finally covered it with a slim strip tape and that did the trick so they could definately fix that in the future. The other thing that COULD BE a point of contention the glossy screen.
