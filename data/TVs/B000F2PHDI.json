Loftis", "ReviewID": "RKZ9P79690TXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched HDTVs very carefully, my final buying choices were this one and a Sony XBR.  Boy am I glad I bought the Samsung.  This TV is AWESOME!!  I never want to cut it off.  A big plus for this set is the 2 HDMI inputs.  I used one for a DirecTV HD receiver and the other for a Panasonic S97 upconversion DVD player.  The picure is truly just outstanding, straight out of the box.  I tweaked around with the colors a little, took a little red out but for the most part left the default settings alone.  I have had the set now for three weeks and I have no complaints at all.  It has plenty of inputs for all your video gear and you are able to label each input on the screen.  The manual is well written and easy to understand.  Besides the HDMI inputs, it has a WISELINK feature which allows you to hook up a USB jumpdrive and display jpeg photos with amazing clarity.  It will play mp3 files too.  It has a game mode to enhance video game play and you can hook your computer up to it and use it as a monitor.  This set does everything, and does it all very well.The speakers are hidden in the cabinet, which gives it a very cool design.  There is some sacrifice of sound quality, but it still sounds very, very good.I think Samsung has come up with a wonderful set, and balanced features very well with price and performance.  I own the 61'' model, they make the same set in smaller sizes too.", "Date": "August 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "Carlos Engler", "ReviewID": "R1I0B5O7T6BUO9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my home theater, essentially for watching movies from DVDs. I also bought an upconverting DVD player and I am very satisfied with the quality of the image.This TV is capable of receiving off-air digital television (DTV), both for standard and hig definition TV. The HDTV reception is very good. Be sure you use the best possible connection from your video sources to this TV for the best possible picture.The only thing that bothers me (so far...) is the fact that whenever you try to reprogram the channels (if you adjust the antenna, for example), the previously programmed channels are deleted and replaced.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, but I think that the prices of DLP TVs should come downs pretty soon.", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best Rear Projection DLP TV you can buy!", "Author": "Wayne \"Omegafiler\"", "ReviewID": "R391ER35WT05MQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent several months researching the current TV's, plasma, LCD, rear projection (LCOS, DLP, LCD), and even a front projector. And of course, checking out each brand from each type of TV, both online, and in stores. Basically, just trying to find the best price vs. performance and something that would suite my needs.I needed a BIG screen, over 50\", so this ruled out LCD and Plasma since they are WAY too expensive above that size. Then I also needed something looked great for playing HD games (Xbox), watching HD movies (HD-DVD), and HD TV (Cable HD DVR). Which really means an awesome 1080p TV. After looking around at various stores, it became clear the Samsung and Sony models were going to be the best bet for rear projection under $3k.Ultimately, the Samsung did win hands down. Thanks to low price on amazon, and a picture that was just as good, if not better than the Sony in some cases! It has an excellent 10,000:1 contrast ratio for very bright white's and perfect black levels. There is also no ghosting at all, and the rainbow effect (which I have seen on previous DLP's) is virtually non-existent. Which makes this set perfect for gaming. Also no audio sync issues as with some of the older Samsung models.In the past month of owning this TV, I've only seen the rainbox effect twice, and it was in a B&W; movie. None of the serveral other people that have watched this TV have noticed it at all. They just comment on how awesome everything in HD looks on the TV - it's quite perfect really. Out of the box, the picture is almost perfect. I just had to slightly lower the contrast, and it's good to go. And thanks to easy to navigate menu's, this is very easily done. While they are a bit sluggish (takes 1-2 seconds to appear), they have plenty of options.When it comes to Inputs, it does appear to be lacking on the HDMI side. While 2 inputs is standard for most models, I could really use at least 3 or 4. 2 is OK for your DVD Player and DVR, but with computers and game console also starting to use HDMI, you can quickly run out of ports. Luckily, a cheap HDMI switch can solve that issue.There is also a PC (VGA) input on the TV that is *suppose* to accept a 1920x1080 resolution at 60hz, per the users guide. Unfortunately I haven't been able to get it to work with a computer at that resolution yet (tried 3). It'll take 720p, all the way up to 1920x1200, but since that's not a native resolution, there is some cropping. This really is a minor issue , since that high of a resolution from a PC via VGA port won't be all that clear anyways. You'd really need HDMI to truly appreciate 1080p. And there are now true HDCP compliant HDMI video cards out now. The xbox will output to this TV at 1920x1080 via the VGA port, but there is a 1-3\" border, and the screen is tilted.Figures though, even though its got the VGA port, it's still a TV, not a PC Monitor. :) The TV won't send information to the source indicating what the correct resolution, refresh rate, and other settings it needs - as a PC monitor would. Future xbox updates may help address some output issues as well. For now, I'm waiting for MS to release HDMI output.And to wrap up this long review, here is a list of Pro's and Con's.Pros:* High Contrast Ratio* Fast color wheel to eliminate rainbows* No Ghosting at all* Perfect for gaming (no audio/video sync issues)* Good viewing angles (for rear projection)* Nice variety of inputs* Only about 17\" Deep for the 61\" model* Weighs only 80lbs!!* Easy setup out of the box* Relatively inexpensive* With it's thin black border and silver control panel, it physically looks GREAT.Cons:* VGA input has some limitations* Needs more HDMI inputs* Plastic bezel feels somewhat cheapAnd that's about it for this TV. Any other \"cons\" such as limited viewing angles and wobulation (google it) are going to affect ALL DLP's at this time; so I won't use that to effect my review. Otherwise, both myself, and many friends who come by to watch movies and play games, are very impressed with this TV. It's quickly converting them from their favorite brand over to Samsung. So this TV is highly recommended if you need a big HD 1080p TV for around $2k.", "Date": "December 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Satisfied Samsung User", "Author": "XL \"Tennis meniac\"", "ReviewID": "R366SROI2481OK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV with high expectation and I am still amazed by its quality.To make the long story short, here are the Pros and Cons from my perspective.Pros:1. It's HUGE. Anyone will be impressed by its size. When watching DVDs, you will feel like watching the big screen in a movie theater. The size is overwhelming (in a good way).2. 1080p. Although it's truely not supported by many of today's programming, it is future-proof. When you get PlayStation 3 or a blue ray player, you can fully utilize this TV's potential.3. Picture Qality. As expected, HD looks amazing on it. What is beyond my expectation is the SD quality. This TV has a smoothing method that can make your SD programming look pretty good. I am really happy about it. Also, my PlayStation 2 looks pretty good using S-video due to the smoothing. Previously I had a Olevia 26\" LCD TV. It doesn't smooth the picture, so my PS2 games look kinda awful.Cons:1. The sound quality isn't that good. It lacks bass and sounds flat. But this won't be a problem if you use your own speaker system.2. Picture quality as PC monitor. Someone said it's 'crystal clear'. However, I didn't find it that way, although I use 1:1 mapping. When you look at it from a distance, it's fine. Just don't expect it to be as clear as your PC LCD monitor.All in all, this TV is very well worth the money. Don't buy the Sony KDS-60A2000 for $500 more, because these two TVs are so similar in quality.", "Date": "October 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "It's Like My Eyes Have Finally Been Opened", "Author": "Road Tester", "ReviewID": "RMEMIDLMFBIMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Holy Crap! I've had an HDTV for seven years (May of 1999) and it was still working fine, but I was tired of not having HDMI (or even DVI) and I knew High Definition technology had moved forward a bit since the late 20th century. But this thing is amazing! I have a Denon 4806 receiver and the DirecTV high definition HDR, so using HDMI is not just possible, but very easy to set up. Watching the HD channels, especially the Discovery and ESPN channels, is truly surreal. My wife and I were watching Discovery on the Top 10 travel destinations, and after seeing the shots around Hotel Bora Bora she said, \"Now we can't go there, because it likely won't look as good in person as it looked just now on this TV.\" The blues, the reds, the crystal clear (but not overly \"harsh\") edges on everything -- and I still haven't even tried my Xbox 360 or MacBook Pro (with DVI out) yet.

The picture is stunning; the ease of use is fantastic. With my Onkyo HDMI receiver this is heaven! The menu on the TV is brilliant with a feature that maps the whole menu tree in one shot.I am having some issues getting the closed captions to work with one of my DVR's which is a drag because I have bad hearing. The tech support was not all that helpful but they did try. It may not necessarily be the TV.Regular TV is a little less sharp than a CRT TV but you get used to it quickly. The HD channels have to be seen to be believed. I have noticed that some channels have much better HDTV than others. Discovery channel is hands down the best. CBS football is better than FOX or ESPN. My guess is it's the cameras they use rather than a signal issue since I have Direct TV.In my research I found some good advice when going to the store to see it. Many stores tweak the picture settings on the TV's they are not pushing so they look duller than the hot item. A couple of quick passes through the menu and this DLP was looking better than the LCD and plasma sets.As for Amazon I am really impressed! Not only did I save $350 from the lowest local store price but I also saved 8.25% tax and delivery fee. If that wasn't enough, today I saw it had dropped $60 in price since I bought it Dec. 1st. I sent an e-mail to customer service and received a response and a credit to my card within 2 hours.

But it doesn't effect the enjoyment since I purchased this for the HD, and it blows me away.The TV controls are simple to use, and the on screen menu's are easy to navigate.The sound out of the TV is not adequate for surround sound, but I hooked up a 5.1 reciever and it makes HD come to life.I like the fact that you can connect components to an AV and/or the TV, so there is room for 3 additional components with my set-up.I also hooked up my laptop (there is 2 connections for the video and audio on the back of the TV).  After changing the video settings on the Laptop (the mannual does a nice job for XP users), it was incredible!The camcorder hooks up to the side of the TV, so there is no need to move the unit away from the wall.

I was going to go with the Sony until I read about the screen turning greenish after a number of hours, reviewer mentioned seeing this on a Best Buy demo set. The very next day I saw the exact same thing on the same model at my BB store in FLA and a co-worker saw it on same model at BB in MN.

This is a fun story...for you.Trucking calls me from the loading dock and reports that they put a hole in the screen with a fork truck. They report that they are contacting Amazon and returning the TV and that I would need to also contact Amazon. The contact, by phone at Amazon, sounded to be in India and had no idea what to do about my problem. We got through it and I was sent a couple of emails to complete the re-ship of TV.

Amazon's service was nothing short of Professional when handling my pre-order and getting my Samsung DLP delivered safely and quicker then estimated.I am currently using an older model DVD player without upconversion or HDMI and it looks awesome. I tried \"Pirates of the Carribean\" and \"The Incredibles\" and both were ultra sharp and crystal clear with bright, amazing colors. I cannot wait to get an HD DVD player to take full advantage of the 1080P resolution.For video gamers, I connected my Xbox 360 to this bad boy and I literally yelled out \"Whoa!\" just within seconds of seeing the Xbox 360 logo flash brightly on screen with the most beautiful shade of green that I have ever seen. I first put in Call of Duty 2 which I've played dozens of times before and I instantly noticed an incredible upgrade in graphic sharpness, resolution, color, and the frame rate was so silky smooth. Every game I popped in- Test Drive, Dead Rising, Far Cry Instincts....they all look Fantastic!! And there is NO delay between the button commands and the screen display as I've read that some DLP's suffer from. I feel like I just got the 360 and all the games as playing them on this Television creates a whole new experience in gaming.The Samsung HL6187 has an Optical output for true digital sound. So I've got my 360 and DVD player's sound connections going right into the tv with the optical cable going out to my 5.1 receiver, and the sound is great.

The last thing i have to say about this tv is that it does well in day light, I remember my grandparents used to have an old projection tv back in the day and if there was any light in the room the tv would be completely faded.

They said they would send my phone number to service center and they would contact me in no more than 72 hours.  72 hours later still no call, I again called Samsung and they said they would contact the service center again and I would be called in 24 hours, still no call.  This was repeated 5 times and each time I asked to be referred to another center but was told none existed in my area.Fianlly after 6 calls, Samsung referred me to another center.  I then called them and they sent up an appointment 3 days later.  Day of appointment technician called and told me from the problem I described when I made the appointment I needed a new bulb (duh) and he had ordered one this morning and would call to make another appointment once they received the bulb. I specifically asked if they had the bulb in stock when I made the appointment.  Why they didn't order the bulb when they first set up the appointment, I don't know.  I called Samsung again and was told bulbs are usually shipped within a week of the order.  Neither the words usually or week improved my impression of their support. My fear is that when the technician comes out to change the bulb he will find another part he has to order and I am back on the Samsung support merry-go-round again.Now I realize that even though the set does (did) have a good picture etc, if you can't see it, it doesn't matter. I now have a very expensive paperweight. For me Samsung support has been a black hole and I have yet to see any results after two weeks and no hope in sight for the near future.  What happens after the warranty is over and I have to pay for a new bulb every three months?  If this sounds like I am not very happy with the situation that is the truth.  I am tired of Samsung and the service centers being sorry for the problems and delays but then telling me there is nothing they can do at this point.  I agree, you solve the problem by doing the right thing the first time or the second time or third time etc I am hoping maybe the eighth time is the charm with my Samsung experience.updated nov 27.

Most stores have these large HD tv's tuned to HD content, and the picture looks awesome.  So, I recently bought the 61\" 1080P hdtv.  As expected, the picture for HD content is awesome, and using an HDMI cable from the cable decoder to the tv improves the picture.  However, the picture from non-HD channels was not great.I watch considerable non-HD content.  CNN, MSNBC, or shows like Apprentice, Smallville, etc. are not broadcast in my area in HD.  The picture on screen for such content is less than ideal.  The large size of the screen does not help either in producing a good picture, resulting in jaggy lines and \"fat pixels\" during motion.While tweaking the settings it became apparent that output from satellite looked better than picture from cable.  The format setting on the cable box makes a difference.  We noticed that all the formats (1080i, 720P, 480p & 480i) were in the list, and this apparently produced a bad image.

Overall I am happy with my 61\" Samsung DLP.  Price for picture size is hard to beat.  Level of detail in 1080P is incredible (even though almost all HD sources are 1080i tops - except if you use HD DVD or Blue Ray).  Lots of inputs including two HDMI, components, USB, PCI, etc.  Should be \"future proof\" for a while.Now the bad.  This is my third Samsung HL-SXX87W TV.  The first was a HL-S5687W which had great geometry (no pin-cushioning or screen bowing) but had the dreaded smudges behind the screen.  Since it was only a day old I had the local deal I bought it from (not Amazon even though they had the best price) exchanged it for a new one.  I did not want a technician replacing the screen on a brand new TV.  So the store did replace it with another, new 5687W.  I plugged it in, looked it over (smudges were most noticeable on a dark or black background) and was satisfied.  No smudges!Trouble was I later notice that this new set had some bowing of the picture (like an hourglass) when watching 4:3 aspect programming.  Samsung says that less than 1/4\" is considered normal on their website and I was close to that number.  But it was an annoyance and i did not remember seeing it on my first set.  I called Samsung who sent a technician.  He claimed he had not seen this before and swapped out the light engine which made no difference.  So Samsung agreed to send me ANOTHER set.  At least my customer experience with Samsung has been excellent.Well, Samsung called me a week later to review the delivery of the new 56\" DLP.  I asked them if it was possible to \"trade up\" to the 61\".  They said for another $270 they would deliver the HL-S6187W.  So I agreed, paid the additional money, and scheduled the delivery.  I figured I would never have the chance again to go larger until this one died so I went for it!  :)About two weeks later the delivery company took away my 56\" and brought in the new 61\" set.  Wow, it was bigger than I thought!  The first week I started to think i made a mistake going to 61\" (I sit about 12 feet from the set) but soon I became accustomed to the larger screen and was very happy.  However, I did notice pin cushioning on this set too, and it is even more noticeable the larger the set.  I called Samsung and the same technician came.  He looked it over and decided that one of the internal clasps at the bottom was not holding correctly and that is why the screen was a little hourglass like.  I also experienced a slight upward curving in letterbox mode towards the bottom of the screen.  In fact, if I would watch ESPN or any program with a ticker at the bottom, you could see where the bottom ticker woudl curve upwards a quarter in or so two thirds the way on the screen from left to right.  When the technician pushed on the top right corner of the TV, the bottom adjusted itself close to \"normal\".Samsung scheduled to replace the entire back of the set (plastic housing) but I finally decided to cancel that.  I did not want a new set to be ripped apart and replaced.  I wiggled the set a bit, gave it a push there and a pull here, and it is close to perfect.  A month later it is still good to me.  I still have the pin cushioning on the sides in 4:3 but it I am the only one in the family who watches in that format.  The kids expand the picture to fill the whole screen.  I decided not to tempt fate again, and kept the set I received.Now, the reasons for only 4 stars:1.  Obviously because I needed to go through 3 sets and it still is not \"perfect\".2.  I can see the dreaded rainbows (RBE) that these sets are known to have.  Only a small percentage of the population experiences this but once you see it, it is hard to no longer notice.  If you look at a high contrast image on a dark background and move your head, you can see what appears to be a trailing rainbow around the image.  Perfect example is white movie credits on a black background.  In most showrooms they have the sets so bright with the showroom so bright you may not realize you are susceptible to RBE.  I did not know until a day after viewing the original 56\" DLP.  Thankfully I am getting more used to it and no one else in the family sees them.  This is not really a Samsung issue - I understand this is common for all DLP sets.  But if you are susceptible to this phenomenon you should avoid DLPs.In summary, overall I am satisfied with my 61\" Samsung.  While it still in not what I consider perfect, based on the picture quality in High Definition, the size of the screen, and the price it is a hard combination to beat.  I use Cablevision as my cable provider and the HD channels are spectacular!  If I were to do it all again I might not choose DLP (only because of RBE) but plasma and LCD have their own issues.  Now that I have my HL-S6187 I would be hard pressed to get rid of it.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "DadWatchingSonsTV", "Author": "George Sica", "ReviewID": "R27BYN6GZ6OXPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son bought this model and it is an exceptional TV and probably the best bang for the buck. Since I did not buy it and I only have only seen this TV once before during Thanksgiving and now during Christmas week, I feel I can give a non bias opinion. In HD mode (cable signal) the picture is increadible. We watched and Miami Heat Game and you can almost read the tatoos on the players arms. The wood grain floor is extremely detailed right down to the lines between floor boards. With foorball you can realy see the litter on the field that is almost distracts from the fanstatic details of the playing field. If the coaches didn't move so much you could read their note's on the clip boards.The Macy's Thanksgiving parade was in 1080 and the picture took your breath away; like wearing 3-D glasses at the theater. It was so detailed that the rain drops on the clothes of the annoucers look like glidder.With local broadcast channels in HD through cable, the local news programs is realy good but you can easily tell when they go to a remote camera crew in non-HD. Most local broadcast are in 720 and you can tell when a cable only channel, such as DISCOVERY-HD is in 1080. Eventually all broadcaster will convert over to 1080 as their equipment needs to be replaced. HD from the local NBC channel from Orlando, Florida must be in 720 since the Jay Leno show was in HD and a real good picture, you do get sensitive to the picture quality from 720 & 1080.The only draw back is non-HD shows & movies particully before HD was a pipe dream, with some fast action scenes you will notice a some areas it will look like it is not in focus, similar to rain drops on the lenses but this is a monster of a screen and a smaller unit would not make this be as visable. When the screen is reduced, while viewing the cable channel guide, these non-HD signals realy look good in the upper corner. The TV does have a nice \"auto\" feature for the best picture size based on the signal (format) it recieves or you can manually set it.Over all DLP is a great and if I were to get a unit myself it be a smaller size since I have a smaller TV room. The only item I have not researched would be the cost of replacing the projection lamps. There is a sticker on the back of the TV for lamp replacement type so it might be a maintence item in the future but that would be better than replacing the entire TV. When you do reseach and everyone (TV & electronic geeks) always state the differences between, LCD, Plasma and DLP. After seeing all three types, they are all good and all of the scare of burn-in, I think, is non-senseSamsung is about the best there is now.

First thing when you hook it up, don't be disappointed with the picture quality of the non-HDTV channels. It's not your TV. It's the nature of the technology. For the most part, standard definition channels may not appear as clear on your HDTV as they do on your regular TV. Hopefully in the near future, almost all channels will be HD. Another important thing is how you set your settings. The default settings \"out of the box\" on the TV will not give you the best picture. First thing you should do is turn off \"DNIE\". It does much more harm than good. Set the picture to \"Warm 1 or 2\" depending on your taste. Turn down the contrast to around 40. Set the brightness to between 45-50. Turn the color down to about 45. Tint should be fine at about 50/50, and sharpness really doesn't make a difference with DNIE off, but most people set it at 0. Most people also turn \"DNR\" off, but I don't notice much difference.....Hope this helps.", "Date": "November 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "The Mother of all TVs", "Author": "A.

To put it in a nut shell it is great I have not been disappointed in the least.  I looked at LCOS, LCD, \"I still don't trust Plasma\"  Truth be told LCOS give a little better picture but not so much so than to justify a $600.00 price difference or greater.  The menus I have found are very easy to use and manipulate which is nice.  The sound is pretty good for 2 speaker audio generated by the TV and the TV does give you the option of using an on screen EQ which was my option and I was pleased with the outcome.  I have had my TV for a little over 2 weeks and it has been GREAT.  I will tell you this if you do decide to get this TV buy it from Amazon, I shopped around all the big stores and even with this TV on sale in their stores Amazon was $650.00 cheaper even after shipping cost of $67.00 dollars.  As I said before LCOS gives a slightly better picture but you wouldn't notice the difference unless the TVs were side by side and even if they were this TV more than holds its own and in alot of cases does it better than the LCOS.

Pick up a VGA cable for the 360 and it will not only upscale your games to 1080p but your DVDs as well(Although this point might be moot once the \"Elite\" comes out)!I'll also mention that I've only had mine for a little over month so I can't comment on the problems people mention but I have had none so far.

I started off by researching the competing technologies and specifications that define HDTV.  Next, I moved on to visiting local retailers to see how HDTVs from different manufacturers compared to each other.  I primarily kept my eye on Samsung, Sony, JVC, and Mitsubishi.  I looked at Sony due to their reputation for high quality displays (WEGA, XBR).  Mitsubishi was investigated because one of my friends who owns a Mitsubishi HDTV.  JVC was looked at primarily because the price points and features closely matched Samsung's.  The Samsung had the best picture of all units I viewed at the local retailers.  Amazon won my hard earned dollars due to their excellent Super Saver shipping and their price point which was more than $300 less than the lowest price offered by a local retailer.  Factor in local taxes, and delivery charges and my savings mounted to more than $500.The Samsung picture is stunning.  Standard DVDs look very good in 4:3 mode or if they are properly formatted for widescreen, 16:9 mode.  The TV has a wealth of customization features that allow tailoring of tint be each of the primary colors plus two additional colors in their 5-color gamut.  Presets for different color styles simplify changing the color temperatures.  A static high-quality, color rich image is present in the setup screen to view existing settings side by side with changes applied.  Additonally, Samsung has viewing themes (e.g. Standard, Movie, Vivid) that changing color, contrast, and brightness characteristics.  Lastly, Samsung includes a feature called DNIe that appplies a high-quality sharpening filter to the picture.  The feature does as promised but can definitely reveal limitations in the image source that would have been missed with the feature disabled.  You can preview DNIe via a split screen that shows the picture with and without the DNIe applied.  I have not used the built-in audio capabilities of the TV so I cannot comment on the audio quality.The Samsung chassis is very elegant and the screen bezel is a piano-lacquer black.  The unit only weighs approx. 80 lbs. and has a surprisingly small footprint.Shipping for me was handled by EGL out of Ohio.  The unit arrived well ahead of time and the delivery quality was mediocre.  The delivery truck arrived with only one employee and I had to assist him with bringing the unit into the house.  I made the deliveryperson wait as the unit was unboxed and had him assist me with placing the TV on its stand.  I then powered the unit and verified that the picture was uniform across all parts of the screen and that there were no scratches or other physical flaws to the plastic screen.  All was well.I've now has the TV for three days and am pleased with its features and quality.

First off, the picture quality, and sound quality of this tv is superb. You'll get the full benefit of 1080p picture and although we have ours hooked up to a Denon surround system, the regular speakers are absolutely fine, very loud and clear. As for the quality of this TV, we've had no issues with this television until the 2.5 year mark. We haven't even had to replace the bulb on this TV, even using the set for around 8+ hours a day.Now I'll come to the white dots problem. If you google Samsung DLP white dots, or Mitsubishi DLP white dots, you'll realize that I'm not making this stuff up. Our television started showing permanent white dots on the screen at about the 2.5 year mark. This is well out of the manufacturer's 1 year warranty. The cost to replace the chip causing the issues is $600-$800 (mostly labor) even though it only took 20 minutes for the technician to replace the chip easily. I have also found that you can get the chip on ebay for about $160 and do it yourself. Thankfully when we purchased this television, we decided to get the 2 year extended warranty (1yr + 2yr = 3 yr total warranty) which was a great idea since we didn't have to pay to fix the problem.The white dots issue appears to be not only a samsung issue or an issue with this model, but a problem with all DLP televisions. If you buy one, buy a 2 or 3 year extended warranty, or else you're going to be very disappointed. At first only 1 dot appeared, then within a week later we had 20 dots on the screen (all over it) when we had it replaced.In the end, because of our extended warranty it's really no harm no foul, we didn't have to move the tv or pay anything, they came and replaced the chip. The tv has a great picture, tons of inputs, and it's 61 inches for under a thousand bucks (we paid $999 in 2009). But if you get the dots without a warranty you're not going to be happy. I really can't believe that Texas Instruments or Samsung haven't issued a recall on the chips or had a class action lawsuit filed against them. 2.5 years is not a long enough time for a tv to call it quits.I've uploaded a photo to the customer images section of this product so that you may see what I mean when I say \"White dots\"Hope it helps!", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "great tv for about 2 and a half years", "Author": "Joe Cioffi", "ReviewID": "R373KJU9SR4GD5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At about that time white dots will appear first one or two, and then more and more every day.

During that time and based on the excellent picture and no problems occuring we purchase a second 61DLP for our downstairs game room. Not long after the second purchase the lamp in the first set went out. I called support and was told the lamp was not covered in the warranty, so we spent $179.00 and installed it ourselves. All went well for another 2 plus years then the set went out again. This time a technician came to the house and informed us that the \"engine\" needed to be replaced. Luckily we had bought the extended 5 year warranty (for $450) and we were still in the warranty period (by 2 months). He replaced the engine with a rebuilt one, can you believe it after spending $450 on a warrantywe got a rebuilt part. But it worked and we were happy again. Only one year later the set went out again and after buying another lamp (which we could not return) we were told by the Samsung technician it wasn't the lamp and the TV for all prctical purposes was dead. My upset is with the fact I spent $4,971.91 for the latest technological set and only got 6 years use out of it, a cost of over $800 per year. But we had the second set and moved it into our living room about 6 months ago. It has seen little use in the game room and had very few hours on it. I thought we would be good for another few years. Nope, today the lamp popped and the tv quit. Is it only the lamp? or is it something else? who knows, we will have to call the Samsung tech people and start all over again.

Amazon.com offered this gorgeous TV, with FREE delivery, and a price that beat the bricks-and-mortar stores by about $450.  The delivery came in about five business days, and the shipping company (Eagle)came when they said they would, and the guy was super-nice.  Post-transaction customer support from Amazon.com was tremendous (Amazon's Sherry S. came back to me within 24 hours on a query -- over the holiday weekend -- and concisely responded to resolve my issue), and I'm hooked.  Buy with confidence from Amazon.com.  About the Samsung?  Yes, a spectacular picture on the 12 channels that offer 1080i high-def programming, DVDs are crisp and bright -- I will tell you that it's tough to watch 480i programming on a TV of this caliber.  This HDTV is a bit ahead of its time, because it's starved for 1080p programming.  If you have 720i, don't upgrade yet, because prices will come down, and most of the high-def is still 720i.  But I'm once again addicted to DVDs thanks to the spectacular picture offered by this Samsung set.", "Date": "January 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "coolest kid on the block", "Author": "J. C.

There are some nice setup routines that allow you to see split screen where one side has the effect turned on, and the other shows it off, for comparison. Honestly, though, unless you are a huge videophile, you are going to love this TV even without much configuration or tuning. Just plug it in, turn it on, and smile! By the way, if you see this TV in a big box electronics store and are not impressed with the picture, it's most likely because the source they are feeding into it is degraded.

I don't want to spend time reviewing everything thats awesome about HD and progressive scan DVD on this set, but wanted to focus on some of it's shortcomings.  Anyone researching an HDTV has come across mention of the 'rainbow effect' on DLPs and this Samsung is no different.  If you are the kind of person who could instantly solve those eye puzzles (you know, where there is a 3-D picture hidden in a mess of shapes and colors), you may want to be careful with DLP.  I have yet to watch a movie on this set where I haven't noticed the rainbow (to clarify, take an image that is mostly dark, focus on the brightest part and look away quickly...you see a rainbow trail from that spot across the screen).  Part of the problem is the size of these screens.  You have to be a good 10-15 feet away from the screen to be able to take in the entire image without having to scan from left to right to maintain focus (and that scanning, in part, causes the rainbow).  It gets a little tiresome on the eyes after awhile, but isn't an issue for most people, especially if you have the room to sit back from the set.  Other than this, the picture is stunning and you would do yourself a disservice if you didn't pick up a blu-ray or hd-dvd player to take full advantage of the 1080p output.Outside of the picture itself, I have a few issues with the interface.  Yes, there are multiple inputs, you can adjust each to your liking and tag them with a number of references (cable, game, dvd, etc)...but there need to be more.  Maybe not more overall, but more of the ones you expect to use.  I understand the reasoning behind including AV and S-video inputs, but c'mon, this is a hi-def set, are you really going to plug your VCR into this (do you even have one anymore?).  Why would you devote multiple inputs to a format that is clearly outdated and would (and does) look absolutely terrible on this set.  2 hdmi (fine), 2 component (give me at least 3), 1 VGA (2 would be nice), no DVI (it's not dead yet).  And that isn't my biggest gripe...why is there no picture scaling?  Sure, you can manually adjust the image size (4:3, 16:9 and 2 zoom levels), but the system doesn't automatically scale the image depending upon the signal output (unless there is a hidden menu option for this setting, but I haven't found it).  If you watch a DVD that has special features in a 4:3 aspect ratio, you have to manually change the aspect or the image will be stretched to fit the screen.  Also, the VGA input doesn't fill the screen unless you go into the menu and manually move and stretch the picture.Again, these are minor technical issues that I am sure Samsung will address with future releases, but are worth considering if you plan on buying this particular unit.  All things considered, you will be hard pressed to get this picture quality for this price from any other manufacturer.", "Date": "January 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Horrible", "Author": "Kindergarten Mom", "ReviewID": "R1JI89HV340RIL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are considering buying this TV I would seriously reconsider.

And if you do, don't buy without an extended warranty!After months of research and reading hundreds of reviews searching for the best DLP TV back in September, 2006, it was almost no contest that Samsung was getting rave reviews for its picture quality.  Most of my tech head and audio/video buff type friends where all sold on Samsung.  After years of being a life-long owner of Sony's and Toshiba's, I decided to make the move and join the Samsung movement.  1.5 years later, I must say that I regret making the switch and will most likely not purchase another Samsung again.  I will not argue the picture quality is brilliant and a joy to view.  I am not at all displeased with the picture quality.  What I am not happy about is replacing a lamp and ballast for $500 less than 18 months after I purchased it for $2,200.As a lighting professional, I understand that all things like ballasts and lamps can and will fail.  But in my world, ballasts carry a 3 to 5 year warranty and lamps are guaranteed for 50% of their rated life and take a lot more abuse than my TV set.  Considering I have owned only 5 or 6 TV's in 23 years and all, except one are still working and only 1 has ever required repair after 8 years!  I simply don't appreciate paying 25% of the TV's value within 18 months of purchase for needless repairs.  Samsung offered no help other than answering the phone promptly, letting me know I was out of warranty and gave me the telephone number to the local service shop.  As far as I am concerned,  a $2,000 TV should work for a minimum of 3 to 5 years without a penny in repairs.  But the reality is, they don't...so in my case, a bad ballast failed and also caused a lamp failure.  Ballast's should not go bad within 2 years.  I will gladly pay for a new lamp, but Samsung should have furnished a new ballast and they should last at least 5-10 years.Anyway, if you are considering buying a Samsung, beware that there are many service issues that are showing up after the warranty expires that will cost you big bucks, such as noisy and bad color wheels and in my case, ballast and lamps.  My Toshiba display is just as nice, and is still working glitch free. My Sony failed after 8 years, but was so outdated, I was actually praying for it to break so I could buy the Samsung.

I shopped around, and I mean REALLY shopped around and by purchasing this television from Amazon.com I not only saved about $500-600 on the tv itself, but I saved close to $150 in tax and another $150 for shipping because Amazon.com gave us free \"white glove\" delivery.  I was actually expecting something like UPS, where it gets signed for and then you have to move it in yourself, because it was free- but to our surprise, they brought the tv in, carried it down the stairs to our family room, then set it up for us to make sure it worked properly before they left.  I was blown away by that. (PS- it was also delivered about 2 weeks before it was scheduled to be delivered, and that was over the Christmas/New Year holiday time, so not bad.)I can't rave enough about the tv itself, you really can't find a crisper picture out there.  When we watch HD channels on our cable box the difference is highly noticable, but when we popped our first 1080p HD-DVD into our HD-DVD player to watch on an HDtv- now THAT is what HD is all about!  I swear, the picture is AMAZING- better than anything I've seen in an actual movie theatre, it was more like standing next to the director watching it live.  Kinda makes us wanna wait for things to come out on HD-DVD from now on.So all in all, we couldn't be happier.  This is hands down the best tv out there for the home market, and saving $800-$900 buying it from Amazon.com just sweetened the deal.", "Date": "January 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV", "Author": "VJC", "ReviewID": "R3QYNT272M8E53", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the most amazing TV I've ever seen.

I didn't call until New Years day and THEY ANSWERED !They told me exactly what to expect from the trucking company (FedEx) and how to handle any problems with a damaged shipment. They install shock guards on the crate to show if any rough handling has been experience by the package.FedEx called me on the Jan 2nd and told me they had a package headed my way and what day and time would I prefer to have it delivered. They could have delivered the TV on Thursday the 4th but I asked them to deliver it on Friday after work so I could be at home to receive it. No problem.The driver called about a half hour out and was there on time. We got it unloaded and moved it into the garage. All the shock indicators were OK and the box was in perfect shape.I set up the TV today and all I cal say is WOW !!! This set is everything it was advertised to be and more. It has a beautiful picture. I ordered this one week ago from OneCall and I have it up and running today. This has been a very pleasant buying experience.People I work with and my neighbors can't believe I ordered this on the internet - let alone from Amazon !

Tuszynski", "ReviewID": "R13YASKKRS8D6B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have spent a fair amount of time viewing and researching the 3 top options for HDTV: DLP, Plasma, and LCD.  Some points below:* The Samsung DLP offers the largest and clearest screen size for your buck.  The picture is bright, clear, and flawless.  I have received nothing but wows from friends and neighbors. The brick and mortar stores in my area could not come close to the Amazon price.  And with Super Saver Shipping for free!* This is not a 'hang on the wall' item.  The DLP is a projection TV and needs to set on a floor stand and  viewed at eye level. There is no wall mount option.  Brightness decreases rapidly as you move off the vertical axis.  In my opinion this is one of the only drawbacks of the DLP technology, but well worth it when you consider the price of similar sizes in plazma or lcd.  Also, if you have experienced TVs mounted at typical height of most wall pictures, you will probably appreciate not experiencing a stiff neck.  Eye level viewing to me is more natural and relaxing, DLP or not.If you are worried about buying such a large pricy electronic item from an online vendor, let me share my experiences.  Amazon policy states that if you have any problems with the TV, you must contact Samsung for in house warantee service.  If you think you will get anything different from a local store, be sure to get this in writing.  Best Buy said that the same Samsung service was standard for them.  Except they charge $50 for delivery to your home, and were pushing a $400 optional extended in home warantee service. Save your money.Overall order from Amazon was flawless.

I spent more than a year researching High Def televisions before I finally bought one, knowing that I would probably have it for a long time.  I waited until the true High Def sets were available, meaning the 1920 X 1080P sets.  Samsung is the absolute champion: the picture on the 61\" DLP is so crisp, so deep, the blacks are so flawless that everything looks three dimesional.  The colors and clarity are just breathtaking: people cannot stop commenting about the quality.  It's not television, it's truly a home movie theater, and has changed the experience of watching films at home.  I added a progressive upload DVD player, which doubles the lines of resolution from DVD discs, and will buy a Blu Ray system to go with it when they iron out a few more bugs.  One of the problems with some High Def sets is that rapid movement, like basketball games, causes the picture to  pixelate.  That doesn't happen with Samsung: those microscopic mirrors they use to project the picture are so fast it eliminates the last nagging problem of High Def.  And this set has two HDMI cables, so I can run my Comcast cable and its High Def channels, and my DVD player without having to use a switcher to coordinate different elements.  And the LG DVD player is fantastic, you get amazing sound from CD's and DVD's, and the whole surround sound system, including the DVD player, is about $300.  The Samsung has a flawless picture from anywhere in the room, including the extreme sides, and the picture is better than most movie theaters: I have been going through my whole DVD collection, and seeing things that I have never seen before in my favorite films.  An amazing piece of technology: I really don't know how much better they can make these things.  Bravo Samsung, they are head and shoulders above the rest.  ONE IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION -- be sure to get the extended warranty on any set you buy: things burn out and break on any set this advanced, and replacing them is expensive.

I got to talk to Stephanie (supervisor).  I told here the situation and she was very professional.  She called the next day to let me know which shop local to me had the service call.  She was great.  I called Omege Electronics, the company that services my area.  They told me that they would not order any parts before they came out to look at the TV.

They said that I had the option of a refund or wait till March and they would swap it out again.  I chose to have the TV replaced again.  Finally, I got the TV, and, can you believe it, the picture has the same problem as the first TV, only not as bad.  Three strikes, Im out.  But Im sure its just bad luck that I got three bad set in a row.  Good luck if you buy this set, I had none.", "Date": "March 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "NICE TV with Minor Flaws", "Author": "K. Santiago", "ReviewID": "R2YGDBZ4UBXHLC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just purchased the 61' Samsung DLP TV not too long ago and I must say that I am fairly impressed. Though the TV is very nice looking it did come with some minor scratches on the monitor, which looks to have been done by the movers pulling it out of the box. The HD channels are beautiful with the exception of minor lines that appear in the top break of the screen (during wide screen mode only) on certain HD channels, which I can do without. I am not sure if the lines are due to the TV or the service provider still investigating. The basic channels look so so I am assuming it is because of the newer technology (1080p) and the basic channels just haven't caught up...there is a lot of floating going on during the shows which is very frustrating. Well, all in all the picture is nice and the TV is beautiful..good buy.", "Date": "March 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "DLP vs PLASMA", "Author": "Ronnie C.

A few comments:  delivery intervals and experience must vary by location -- mine was okay, just 2 days late; the price is right -- compared with Best Buy & Circuit City as of December 06.  I like the relatively light weight of this TV -- I had to hire 2 Guatamalans off the street to get the old 40 inch Mitsubishi down the stairs and to the dump.  The size and picture quality are impressive -- coming from a 50 inch plasma as my main TV.Considering the cost and good picture, this TV compares well with my Pioneer plasma.  Just know that there are considerable differences.  The plasma picture is better -- move close in on each one and you will see the shortcomings of the dlp that are much less perceptible at a reasonable distance.  The viewing angle of the plasma is not a factor, whereas if you move far enough to either side (or up & down) on the dlp the picture is out of range.  For typical installs this should not be a problem, just don't expect to mount this TV over the fireplace and have good viewing.  Room lighting is also less a factor with plasma than dlp.  The plasma will show through well in bright light -- the dlp less so.  Finally, maintenance should also be less with the plasma as half-life of the picture is reportedly 30 years.  This dlp comes with instructions on replacing the lamp.  They're not specific on how often -- I'm sure it varies with use and environment.  So, the plasma is my main TV, but this is a great 2nd TV for less than 1/3 the price!", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not Happy", "Author": "Midge \"Midge\"", "ReviewID": "R3EP8WS56H6XCX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received my TV in about 10 days after ordering with no problem.
