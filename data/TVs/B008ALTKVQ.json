If not then when you watch tv in a dark room/at night the TV thinks the light from the show you are watching is the remote control and the TV will shut itself off.I had the TV for a while and it worked fine, but I changed jobs (about 3 weeks after the warranty ran out) and also changed my viewing habits: whenever I would come home late at night (dark outside and the lights in the room were shut off) the TV would shut off by itself. It's in a white room and only happened with the lights off, and when I'd watch colorful shows, like anime or Adult Swim or even commercials with bright, blinking lights. I figured the light bouncing off the walls would hit the TV's remote window and fool it.Other people said that it was some electronic board overheating but: after putting the tape over the remote IR window (on the TV set itself) it hasn't shut itself off in over 3 months! Try only 2 or 3 layers of scotch tape-that's what worked for me and the remote can still get through to power on/off and volume control.The other thing I don't like is that if you plug it into your cable box with a coax cable the closed captioning works; if you use the HDMI cable it doesn't work: but that could be the cable box's fault: solution, leave both plugged in and watch HDMI 99% of time, and when I need closed captioning just click the input button until the coax comes on: then the closed captioning (from the TV) works just fine.With all that said: this TV was VERY inexpensive and looks great (with an HDMI cable). I'm actually very happy with it. I'd actually buy another one and just tape it up on the first day: problem solved! When I looked at TVs this was: 1) the best looking picture in the size I wanted and 2) the cheapest.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Panasonic 32\" LCD 720p 60Hz HDTV | TC-32LC54", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417e07MqO1L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008ALTKVQ"}}
