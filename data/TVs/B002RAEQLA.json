{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome TV!!", "Author": "KK", "ReviewID": "R2XI1IWP0Y2GZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my 19\" Emerson TV on Aug 9th but waited till today, Oct 26th, to allow ample time to experience the TV's performance in order to give it a fair and honest review. So now after 2 months of use my husband and my consensus is that this TV was an excellent purchase and is well worth the 5 star rating and nothing less!  The HD quality is beautiful, the color is beautiful, the picture is bright and crisp, the sound is high quality and the built-in DVD works perfectly. The picture is clear HD quality with bright color. The TV we replaced this one with was also an Emerson. We'd had it for 12 years and it too worked perfectly and never gave us one problem, but it wasn't a flat screen, it was an older boxy model that only had a 13\" screen with a built-in video player which is why we wanted to upgrade.  And we're so glad we stuck with Emerson.  They are highly recommended and if you're considering buying this TV you'll be very happy with it. However, the buzzing DVD reported by one reviewer is an unfortunate  circumstance.  Something like that could happen with any brand of TV out there. None are 100% perfect 100% of the time.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great College and Bedroom TV!", "Author": "LTL446", "ReviewID": "R3BT7W7QRZOHGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What really made this TV for me was the built in DVD player.I bought this TV in college for my very small apartment. The price was so good it made me worry the TV would not be functional. (I was hard pressed to find a TV of the same size without the DVD player) I'm glad to say I've had the TV for a couple years now and it still works great!Having the built in DVD player makes the is very easy TV to move from place to place. No more cords tangled up everywhere!A couple of things worth mentioning:- The DVDs are ejected from the top of the TV, and therefor this TV can't have anything directly above it.-Depending on where you put this TV the angles might cause a slight glare and distort the colors. There is a reasonable range in which the TV looks fine, but it is not the entire room.This is a great TV for a college kid! Now that I'm out of school I use it in the room I rent. If you're looking for a single room TV this one would be a excellent choice!", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not buy from this seller.", "Author": "Marioalosangeles", "ReviewID": "R2CUB4JIYM4O3F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was really excited to buy this for my mother to replace her old little tv. As soon as the box arrives I am telling her all the great features of this T.V to her. The best part was supposed to be the built in DVD. The first thing I looked for was the DVD slot to test it and to my surprise, there was no DVD attached. There are 4 screw holes on the back where the DVD is supposed to be mounted, but no DVD. I am very very disappointed. The TV is probably good, I encourage you to buy it from someone else other than this seller. I hope I can return it and get my money back. The TV itself has good reviews on other sites. I myself can't say much about it because I was too mad to turn it on to give it a run.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great RV tv.", "Author": "Charles R.

Was very excited about the tv/dvd combo but the dvd player buzzes so loud that even turning the volume up doesn't mask it. It bothers my daughter so much that it gets her upset when she can't hear the movie over the buzzing. I didn't want cable in her room so I bought this just so she could watch a dvd before bedtime but this is just not worth the headache and I will be returning it.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "16:9 LCD panelWith a 1366 x 768 Full HD resolution\n800:1 dynamic contrast ratio\nHDMI Inputs: 2\nEnjoy a superior HD experience with HDMI one cable experience", "Name": "Emerson 19\" 720p 60Hz HDTV LCD DVD Combo, LD195EMX", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ppdsUP10L.jpg", "ProductID": "B002RAEQLA"}}
