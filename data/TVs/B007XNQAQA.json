Coppens \"movie nut\"", "ReviewID": "R1JAAZ77Y5Y6HR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Mitsubishi WD-92842 Nov 2012. I got it from Paul's TV and I highly recommend them. They will beat anyone else's price with a phone call, and they deliver free with White Glove (unbox it and put it in your home wherever you request and make sure it works correctly before leaving).  I love the DLP HDTV, and for the money you can't beat DLP. The best time to buy any big screen HDTV is the last week of JUNE into the first week of JULY.  Watch the prices.  They will go down then, but go back up again in early July.  The other best time to buy is late NOVEMBER (around black Friday or black Monday online).  I watched the prices rise and fall all year, and bought the new 92\" for $2599 in late November. I wanted the WD-92840, but they gave me the newer model WD-92842 for last year's model price.  Haven't seen that price matched online since I bought it.  The picture is superb, and the only problem you will ever have is with the lamp (bulb) although I have yet to replace a lamp myself in any of the 3 HDTVs I have owned. I always buy an extra lamp (with housing) for about $100 or less here on Amazon.  So that is not a problem, and replacing the lamp is VERY easy, and the directions are in the owner's manual for the TV anyway.  The thing to remember in order to get a long life from your lamp is to turn the TV on once each day, and leave it on until you go to bed.  It's NOT the number of hours you use the lamp that wears it out so much as the number of times the lamp is turned off and on.  This 92\" is the greatest purchase for the price I have ever made.  Hope this helps some of you with your shopping!  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that for some reason, the Mitsubishi people programmed this model to automatically switch from your DVR to your Blu-Ray player or your ROKU player whenever each is turned on. If you have them all on before loading a DVD, the TV sometimes gets confused and turns itself off.  I solved this by just making sure to turn off the DVR before turning on the Blu-Ray player, that seems to solve the problem.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too expensive now", "Author": "Victor S. Chang \"workboot\"", "ReviewID": "RLBEVVC9QJPG4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was considering an upgrade from a smaller Mitsubishi 73\" DLP TV to this larger 92\" size.  It is a shame that Mitsubishi stopped this excellent product line at end of 2012 and got out of the DLP TV business.  The price of the remaining stock is getting higher everyday and too expensive now.  I am considering getting a large 120\" fixed projector screen and a good projector instead. The combination appears much cheaper and provides better picture quality, except for suffering from ambient lighting.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Playing with price", "Author": "Sue", "ReviewID": "R15VG4WLDFND1I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have to agree with najaf. The same model year and size was selling for $3000 less 2 months ago. The TV's are very good. I have a 73 inch model (that I've had for many years) and wanted to upgrade to a larger screen. I started looking at both the 82\" and the 92\". I really wanted to get last years model (82840) because of the clear contrast screen that is now not available on the 82842 models but couldn't find one, so I started looking at the 92\" model because of the screen. When I first started looking back in early January these same models were available for $3199 which makes it a very good buy. But at almost $6300 there are better buys out there. While other models screen size may not be as large, there is really not a single TV on the market that's really worth over $4000, unless you have more money than you need and are just trying to impress someone. Wait for the price to come down, or buy something else at less than $4000. If you are really trying to impress, don't be a piker and buy the Panasonic 103\" Plasma. Other wise don't waste your money.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "You Missed the Wave", "Author": "Fab K.", "ReviewID": "R25TO17HDDLQSZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent TV!!If you know the volatility of electronics, you would have anticipated that this TV's price would have gone up this much. I reluctantly bought mine 2 weeks after Mitsubishi discontinue announcement because I knew the price would go up as this is the only TV of its kind. The TV was originally launched in 2011 starting at 6K. Mitsubishi's main pitch was the size but majority of consumers now prefer flats. Personally, other than the DLP shape which has greatly improved over the years, there is really no difference. The TV looks like a flat from any viewpoint anyway. I bought a 73inch in 2007 and at that time, it was the biggest TV on the consumer market. It took 5yrs for regularly TV to reach that size at affordable prices so i anticipate it will be the same for any other flats to reach the 92 size affordably. These are great TVs. You just missed the wagon my friend. I personally wouldn't buy the same TV at the current price. It's just better that you wait for the next wave.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "4 HDMITM with CEC\nBluetooth\u00ae A2DP Audio Streaming\nStreamTVTM Internet Media\n16 Speaker Immersive Sound Technology", "Name": "Mitsubishi WD-92842 Diamond 92\" Class 3D Home Cinema TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vBp91KHtL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007XNQAQA"}}
