{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A 2-D Review of a 3-D TV.  Great TV.", "Author": "Anthony Pantliano \"The Photo Guy\"", "ReviewID": "RYA2BL918J657", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Disclaimer:  First I'd like to say that I do not have the equipment to view this set's 3-D picture yet.  I bought it as a hedge against 3-D.  I'm not sure if 3-D is going to take off, but if it does I know I'm ready for it.  I thought I would get that out of the way so while you will know I cannot review that feature of the TV, I still have a lot to tell.  Now on with the show...The Panasonic comes shipped in a conveniently designed box where you simply punch out four inserts and lift the box top off of the base.  Sort of like when you get a cake from the bakery in a plastic container.  Inside's the TV, the stand, the remote (and batteries), the power cord, and the owner's manual.  Attaching the swiveling base is very simple and involves screwing a metal fork onto the base then slipping the TV onto the fork and screwing it down.  The whole process takes 5 minutes and I was able to do it without any assistance.  Also, I'd like to mention that Amazon shipped the TV through a company called HomeDirectUSA.  They were very professional and opened the box for me to make sure the TV was undamaged.Looks wise the Panasonic isn't much.  It's framed in a piano black trim and is about 3 inches deep.  The base is also done in piano black with a chrome band around the edge.  At the bottom of the TV's frame is a bronze colored streak.  Overall it's a classy look, but also nothing special.  On the lower edge of the TV are the 3-D glasses' transmitters and the remote sensor.  On the left side of the TV are various buttons (channel, volume, menu, input, and power) along with a few inputs (HDMI, composite video, and an SD card slot) and two USB ports (for hooking up the wireless dongle amongst other things).  On the back of the set (on the set's left side viewed from the front) are two HDMI, two components, one composite, one RF/coaxial, and a PC input.  There is also an optical audio out.  The TV's build quality is very good, the materials are nice, and it feels sturdy overall.  Lastly, the included remote is long and narrow, but well laid out with large buttons that light up.Using TV is straightforward and easy.  It guides you through the set-up, scans for channels, sets up the network, and sets the clock.  The menu system is logically laid out and easy to use.  The picture controls are many and allow you to fine tune precisely, although the pro-setting are only available in Custom picture mode.  Besides Custom mode there is Vivid, Standard, THX, and Game modes.  Each mode can be tweaked individually and set up differently for each input.  Some of the features included with the Panasonic are 5 individual timers to turn the TV on and off and a sleep timer.  There is also VieraLink that, if the TV is connected to the Internet, allows you to view YouTube or Netflix among other services (I have not used this feature since I stream that content through my Blu-ray player).  You can insert an SD card or a USB jump drive into the set and view photos, videos, or listen to MP3 files as well.  This feature worked well when I inserted an SD card from my Canon camera and the photos looked very nice on the screen.  Another nice feature is being able to set channels as your favorites so you can jump to them more quickly, or have the channel only scan favorites when you go up and down channels.  Features to reduce burn-in include a pixel orbiter (which very slightly shifts the picture to prevent burn-in) and a scrolling bar pattern that wipes a white bar over a black screen for 15 minutes.  While burn-in is much less of an issues with plasma sets then it used to be, if you like to watch non-high definition TV with the bars on the side, or play video games and pause them for a long time, plasma may not be the best bet for you.  Finally, there are light sensors on the front of the TV to allow the set to adjust its brightness based on ambient light conditions.Picture quality on the Panasonic is where this TV shows it mettle.  I have the set hooked up in the following manner.  My LG Blu-ray player and Nintendo Wii are hooked up to my Onkyo receiver, which is in turn hooked into the Panasonic via HDMI.  The Blu-ray is hooked into the receiver using HDMI and the Wii using composite video.  For cable, I use the RF/coaxial input.  I am not a videophile and tweaked the picture menu myself where I settled on the Vivid setting with some adjustments to make it considerably less vivid (usually I hate vivid mode but I like it on this set).  I find the picture looks best when I leave the automatic adjustment for ambient light on.  I also have the TV set-up to show 95% of the image where the edges are cropped off so I don't view any image breakdown at the picture's edge.  Watching any high definition content, be it Blu-ray, cable TV, or streaming Netflix, the picture looks its best with great detail and clarity (this is especially true when watching Blu-ray discs).  Watching standard definition content doesn't look bad either, obviously it doesn't look great stretched out to 50\", but the details hold up well and it's more than acceptable.  Regardless of the source, the colors are accurate, the dynamic range is great with deep and detailed shadows, and there is no motion blur even when playing video games or watching animated content.  My previous television was a 32\" 720p LCD and compared to the LCD the plasma Panasonic looks more \"fluid\" and \"film-like\".  The details don't jump out at you like they do on a high end LCD set (sometimes obnoxiously), but the picture is clear and sharp none the less.  The screen has an anti-reflective coating that seems to work well.  I have the set in a room with two big windows on the west side and I adjust the blinds when necessary to keep the sun's reflections off the screen.  In the end, a plasma is no worse in this regard than a traditional tube television.  Overall, I am very pleased with the picture and am a plasma convert.The TV's built-in speakers are fine for casual viewing, but if you want a true big-screen experience you're going to want to hook this set up to at least a 2.1 system, if not a full blown 7.2 system.  Mine is hooked up to a 5.1 system.Speaking of sounds, I don't notice any humming from the set.  Occasionally, if I have muted the sound and a bright white scene comes on I hear a slight hum, but it's barely noticeable and goes away as soon as the scene changes.  Also, the set does not give off much heat as far as I can tell.There are only a few negatives I have about the set and they are as follows: 1) The piano black trim on the set shows reflections much worse than the screen itself.  2) The set only has 3 HDMI inputs, most have 4.  3) The remote sensor is very low on the set and I have my center speaker in front of the TV so I have to angle the remote upward in order for the signal to reach the TV.All in all... a great plasma set, with tons of inputs, features, and adjustability, but an especially great picture quality.P.S.:  Sorry for the long review.  There is a lot to cover.  If you'd like to know anything else leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer.11/24/2010 Update:  Hitting the sub-menu button on the remote allows you to quickly change the behavior of the channel up/down button.  For instance you can have it scan only your favorites, or just the digital channels.  This is a nice touch, and a nice shortcut.02/26/2011 Update:  The television is still going strong and has maintained its excellent picture quality.  I left a menu from my DVD player paused on the screen for about a half hour by accident, and after about a minute the retained image was gone.  No issues with burn-in, humming, or anything.  Great set.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Possibly the perfect tv!", "Author": "TitansFury", "ReviewID": "R2E1QBZBZ2TH6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I made a mistake and purchased a 50 inch Samsung 3D plasma and returned it within a week due to horrible image retention.  After learning a lesson on the importance of doing research on a purchase this large I went to work on trying to find the best tv in my price range (1800 bucks at most.)  With most individual reviews and head to head reviews I read I kept seeing Panasonic 3d plasmas at the top of the list.  These tv's were not only voted best for 3d but also for 2d.  So I went ahead and pulled the trigger on this set and I'm extremely glad I did.  There are four main things I want a tv to be able to do; watch sports, play video games, watch regular programs and also to watch movies.  And this set performs incredibly well in all areas.I watch a lot of football and UFC and so far both of these sports look amazing on this tv.  Everything runs smoothly and there is no issues with motion blur.  So it's great for sports.I own an XBOX 360 and love first person shooters (Call of Duty, Halo, etc..) and so far I have only played COD: Black Ops on this tv but it's a lot of fun to play on this set.  The game always looks smooth and the colors really pop.  Once I got use to the size of the tv (I was playing on a 37 inch before) I fell in love with gaming all over again.As far as watching regular tv, well, I can say that I wish I had HD tv but unfortunately I don't.  The standard definition looks great on this tv though.  My Direct TV receiver isn't working properly at the moment and I can only view a few programs but so far so good with SD.Watching movies is where this tv blows other sets out of the water.  So far I have watched two regular Blu Rays (The Expendables and Rambo) and one 3d Blu Ray (How to Train Your Dragon) and all I can really say is WOW.  I saw both The Expendables and Rambo in the theatre and honestly I think the picture is better on this set than it is at the movies.  The colors and amount of detail are incredible.  I watched Rambo on the Samsung while I had it and while it did look good it wasn't as good as with this Panasonic.  As far as 3d goes I won't say it's as good as IMAX but it is as good as true 3d in a movie theatre.  I saw Dragon in 3d at the movies as well and I actually enjoyed it more on this tv.  Side note on 3d; I don't know if it will take off and if it doesn't that's okay.  I bought this tv because it had the best reviews for 2d so the 3d was a bonus.  But it's a fun bonus.I've also watched some tv on a Samsung LED and I can say with confidence that this Panasonic has a better viewing experience.Now that I have this tv all I need is a better sound system and some theatre seating and I'll be set.  For the money you won't find a better set.  Why spend more for an LED when this tv is better and costs less?  If you're debating on a great tv to get in this price range then I'd say go for this set.  I'm glad I did!", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wow! This is an amazing TV!", "Author": "M. Zelenz \"The Seeker\"", "ReviewID": "R2R8HRNQGYT72V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was looking for a gift for Mom and Dad (a.k.a. me and my wife) and like to buy things we all can enjoy with the whole family.  So being in the TV programming business I've been attending seminars on 3D and picking up very usual tips.  Recently I learned from a vendor that Plasma is better than LED with 3D and that Panasonic and Samsung have already started exclusive 3D content wars with Panasonic holding \"Avatar\".  After reviewing prices and reviews I decided to go with Panasonic and couldn't be happier.  Amazingly this 50 inch TV weighs less than the 42 inch Sharp HD set it is replacing.  Was able to mount on the wall and just blown away by the picture.  And so far the sound has also been more than enough for the room although i'm looking into a surround sound system.  The 3D is way cool (purchased A Christmas Carol with Jim Carey).  Set up was a breeze and very pleased with the free shipping.  Price dropped slightly after Thanksgiving and Amazon rocked with their matching guarantee.  All in all a great experience and very pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "The TV I wanted at last!!!", "Author": "Loves Amazon", "ReviewID": "RC6BTWPNAP3HX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first thought in writing this review - buy this TV while the promotions from Panasonic are still available! Do not hesitate if you are in the market for a 50-inch TV - this is one of the very best TV's available at the best possible price from the best retailer in the market.Second thought - this is my third attempt to find the right TV with Amazon in the past two months, and I am very grateful for Amazon's 'Gold Glove' level of customer service.  I first purchased a Samsung PN50C550 plasma - great image quality, but the Samsung had significant image retention issues and a horizontal image banding effect that they would not warranty after two service visits.  Returned this TV for the Toshiba 55 LED 240hz 3D. One word - flashlighting.  Significant bright spots on the screen in any moderately dark picture. Also, after becoming accustomed to plasma, the LED was a huge step down in picture quality in every way describable - I won't even try to elaborate.  Never realized the importance of off angle viewing that you get with a plasma!!  Amazon picked both TV's up, re-packaged and carted  them away without any trouble.Now about the Panasonic GT25 - picture quality is simply amazing.  Rich, accurate colors.  Incredible clarity.  Black levels and contrast are everything that Panasonic claims.  Minimal issues with image retention - virtually none, and this was an issue with the Samsung from day one.  3D is great - picture is clear and the images pop off of the screen.  I find that the 3D works well even at greater distances and angles than are considered optimal.  Will 3D improve over time?  Of course, but the GT25's 3D viewing is a great feature that the whole family really enjoys now (at only $120 more than the G25).One more thought about this whole TV buying escapade - I spent plenty of time in retail stores assessing picture quality between brands.  This is not a good assessment of picture quality!!!  Realized that different retail chains must be enticed to promote different brands/TV's, as I found that they run the pictures to some brands with HDMI cables and some with standard cables - that's going to mean a HUGE difference in picture quality when assessing the pictures side by side.Buy the GT25 - you will be very happy (thrilled is a better word) with this TV!", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exellent Tv", "Author": "fm", "ReviewID": "RCTBI6FY7G5PN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "crisp picture, 3d better than movies, will blow you away but.....you must set it righttry this:picture mode: vividcontrast: 69brightness: 78color:65tint:+11sharpness:71i wish someone would have posted that for me, would have saved a lot of timeEnjoy!", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic VIERA TC-50GT25 50-inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R3LJ42M4RSJUER", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Last year I bought a Panasonic 42 inch Plasma HDTV and the picture on it is so sharp that when Amazon/Panasonic put a promotion on to save an addition 400.00 dollars for Purchasing this 50 Inch 3D plasma, 3D Blu Ray and Avitar 3D Glasses starter set I could not resist, I also saved an additional 20% because I received a code from my Amazon Chase card for an additional 20% off so it made my purchase for all 3 just under 1100.00 dollars, an almost 50% saving!Now on to the review.... I am only rating the TV as 4 stars because it does not have the exact crispness as my 42\" Panasonic Plasma HDTV(TC-P42G10)which is as sharp of a picture as I have ever seen. I believe the reason is that no matter how big you HDTV is it is only going to have 1080 lines of resolution, so the larger the HDTV the larger the pixels. So, the larger the TV the grainer the picture will be. From my experiences a 46\" HDTV is the max size I would buy, anything over that size you will start to see a less crisp picture unless you are going sit 12 or more feet away from the TV.Now having said all of this, the picture quality is still good and vivid. There is no blur on fast motion movies or sports, plasma are best for this. We watched the 3D Avitar movie that came with the Glasses starter kit and I will say that viewing 3D was awesome. There were no issues the 3D works as advertised and the 3D was very very crisp! The glasses get a little uncomfortable behind the ears after an hour though. Only issue I had is that my Pioneer Elite A/V reciever which I bought just last year does not support 1.4 HDMI, your receiver has to support 1.4 HDMI or you will have to hook your 3D Blu Ray Direct to your TV and then run audio back to the reciver.Shipping is always my biggest fear with large electronics. My HDTV arrived last year in excellent shape but I was still a little apprehensive because this TV was even larger. Amazon did a genius thing this year, they built a Triangle box that the manufactures box fits into. This triangle box that Amazon has designed does not allow the shippers to set the TV on its side or upside down, it forces them to ship the TV as intended this side up!In Summary:This TV still has a good vivid picture, but because of it's size(still has 1080 lines)you will have to sit 12 to 15 feet way for full clarity, so if you don't have this space buy smaller. 3D works as advertised and 3D is very Crisp, must be the glasses? If using 3D make sure you A/V receiver supports 1.4 HDMI. Don't be afaid of shipping Amazon packages the tv in a way that shippers are forced to adhere to the manufactures mandate of this side up when shipping! Great TV (if you can view from 12 to 15 feet away) and Great price.", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Could this be the Perfect TV", "Author": "Rac2873", "ReviewID": "R1IFKZBRZTMIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My old Samsung DLP went down and it was time to replace my TV. I was weighing LCD vs LED. I actually brought home and LED and hated it. There was so much light bleed in and on really dark scenes it looked grey not pitch black. So back to the drawing board. I heard some horror stories about Plasmas in the past. So I was hesitant but I started to research them and boy was I wrong.Plasma is a superior technology to both LCD and LED. So I went with this Panasonic. Plasma have superior refresh rates 600hz. No motion blur what so ever and there is no Soap Opera effect that you would get with LED and LCD. Another problem with LCD  and LED is that their viewing angles are horrible. You only get a great picture if you are standing dead center to the picture. If you move 25 deg off center the TV loses a lot of color and the blacks turn to grey. With a Plasma you can stand 120 deg off center and you will not lose any picture quality. It is something to see to be believed. Lets talk about the blacks. WOW!! They are unreal, I watched Avatar on Starz HD and the black space was a dark as the night sky. No bleed in what so over. I was amazed at the deep blacks and the contrast as well. I can put any movie and be blown away by the picture. This TV whips my old Samsung DLP. My wife thought all HDTV were created equal until I showed her this TV. I have yet to invest in the 3D technology but I have time because I am going to re-watch all my Blu-rays to experience them all again for the first time.The thing with Plasma's is that they need time to break in so whatever you do for the 1st 100 hours do not run on Vivid. This TV has a THX calibration picture setting, use it. Set the Brightness and contrast to less than 60 and you are good to go. I have mine set to 52 brightness and 56 contrast and it looks amazing. After the break in period if you want to calibrate go ahead but not before.Trust me if you buy this TV you will be in awe and you will love this TV. Just remember it gets better as you break it in. I will update when I get around to getting the 3D Kit.Oh and for the price this TV will last you 100,000 hours. That is 30 years.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Probably the best 3D TV you can buy right now", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2T8ANF0DL7V7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided that my old 42\" rear projection set (that couldn't even do 1080p) needed to go. As a 2D TV, this set is everything you could possibly hope for. There are plenty of other reviews here giving the set accolades for its 2D performance, so I'll leave that alone. As far as 3D is concerned, the technology is really impressive and I seriously doubt you can do any better than this TV as of right now. Is that going to change in the next few years? Maybe. So, if you are like me and want an all around upgrade, get this TV. If you are buying this only for the 3D, that's also great... but there are some things you should know first.I'm a PS3 owner so there is a fair amount of 3D content available (3D Blu-rays, 3D PS3 games, 3D Downloadable movies from PSN, and soon 3D streaming movies from VUDU). For the vast majority of this content, the 3D effect produced by the Panasonic is really pretty remarkable. There is minimal (though still noticeable) crosstalk between the left and right images. That said, even when its working well, I wouldn't say the image quality is as good as its 2D counterpart. Active shutter glasses by definition cut the amount of light hitting your eyes by half. Coupled with the fact that the glasses themselves are pretty tinted, you get a dramatically darker image through the glasses than without. This doesn't mean much if its movie night and you are turning all the lights off and the sound system up... you will definitely be immersed and not disappointed in the picture quality. I just wouldn't bank on it being all that great in heavy sunlight.As I said before, that previous description applies to the majority of 3D content. Unfortunately, there is some content that just really doesn't work well and will almost assuredly give you a headache. Now, let me just say that this may not be the fault of the Panasonic TV. I don't have another 3DTV to compare to, so it may very well be the 3D content itself. When things gets really \"close\" and try to jump out at you, it just doesn't look that great. It's at its best when you are looking through a movie set like a kind of diorama. For example, the \"3Dnet Sizzle\" advertisement for the new Discovery 3D channel coming out just looks terrible. I mean, really. Terrible. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this (at least as your first 3D content) as it will definitely trigger some buyer's remorse. Again, this may well be the content itself and not the TV. But even if that's the case, just know that the 3D content out there is kind of hit or miss.When all is said and done, this is a fantastic TV. It looks great in 2D and 3D. If you are like me, then the minor issues I've described so far can easily be overlooked.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Tsibs7\"", "ReviewID": "R21JD1RCBVSP3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this TV a few days ago and I am very impressed. I had a 50'' Samsung DLP before this which I really liked but wanted to upgrade. This TV has it all. Amazing picture quality and a lot of customization. I don't have 3D glasses yet but I'll make sure to let you know if it works out well. I can just speak for the 2D aspect of the TV and all I can say is that it's the best TV out there for the price. I paid $980 for this TV brand new in Portland, OR (so no sales tax!) because I got the sales rep to knock off $120 the asking price. I honestly looked around at all the different places (including Amazon) and different brands and couldn't find a better deal. Even if you end up buying this TV between $1000-1199 you're still getting a spectacular deal. The only real difference between the GT series and the VT series is the Infinite Black vs Infinite Black Pro, and extra HDMI port (whoopie) and a few other minor things. This TV also has something the VT series does not, the 2D to 3D conversion. I know this doesn't sound all that great but it's an option if you want it. I understand that it's not as slim as LEDs or that it doesn't have the prettiest design but is that really what you buy a TV for??

Even with it's age, it is a true HD with many of the current options on it, including HDMI.While at Vidio Only, I kept seeing this Panasonic and it's great picture. It was actually captivating me. When I spoke with the salesman, I had 1 main concern other than picture quality, plugins and general look of the TV - reliability. He produced 2 Consumer Report magazines which had all sorts of data concerning current/recent televisions. Each article showed that Panasonics were the ones LEAST returned for typical problems. Samsung was up near the top for returns which surprised me as they usually get great reviews. Most of the newer brands out there were also heavy in returns as compared to Panasonic.The salesman also told me he had bought a Panasonic a few years back for $4,000 and he was moving it to a back room and getting this model as it's picture was much improved. And then there was the price. He also metioned this has the better technology the models up the scale have - for 6 to 8 hundred more, just less options. The new Panasonic Blue Ray player I am waiting on will take care of these and more.The final information that brought me over to this brand/model was that the \"Plasma GURU\" who was with Pioneer in their TV heyday was now at Panasonic, thus the great picture.The TV, to me, has great and easy setup. When you go through the setup, it has sub titles that explain what each adjustment does. I have no idea about TV nomenclature and this was a huge help for me. I invited my daughter and her boyfriend over for dinner and they were wowed by the picture. Her comment was \"It seems like you can walk into the screen\". This was on 2D HD via cable. I have yet to try the 3D.  Now, I am waiting for Panasonics new 3D Blue Ray DVD player that has full wireless internet functions on it which is to be released soon.And I am also content with the sound as I do not expect a TV to have sound like a seperate system has.

I researched 4 different brands & models and the reviews for this tv for it's 3D quality beat out all the others. So I purchased it and I am very pleased with it.

The setup is easy and the menus are simple. The HD picture quality is perfect. As this TV replaced my old 27 inch LCD HDTV, i can say this has better contrast, color and images are sharp.3D picture is ok, but not great. You can see at times the crosstalk/ghosting. Its not very prevalent though. The glasses that came with essential pack is bit uncomfortable if you wear glasses. It does strain your eyes. The depth is good... images are clear (i saw coraline 3d)... But again, look at this way. You will watch in 2D more than 99% of the time. 3D technology itself is in its infancy in my opinion. So don't expect too much from 3D..even though you will enjoy whatever the small content that is out there.Now what is not so good about this TV (or could be better...)1. only 3 HDMI. So if you have multiple gaming devices + bd player + cable - then you may be out of luck.2. Samsung and Toshiba are better looking TV than this... and also lighter.3.

The TV I bought is the 2010 modelThis is my second Panasonic Plasma to buy and I have not been disappointed.  I bought one of the 46\" S1 panels last year after Christmas (Jan 2010) and I really love it.  A few months ago we had a TV go out, so I decided to replace that one with my 46\" and decided to look for a 50\" plasma.  I went to Best Buy and after looking at the TVs I first decided on a samsung PN50C550.  I have to admit, the picture looked great on the Samsung and it is a very beautiful TV.  Long story short about the samsung, it had horrible image retention problem, or at least my panel did.  So, I returned it and decided that I was def returning to Panasonic.Did some research on Amazon and couldn't believe the price differences on here compared to BB, HHGregg, and Sears.  The thing that really sold me on this TV was my past experience with Panasonic plasmas, features (under 1k for a 50\" 1080p, Internet Apps and 3d...awesome),  price, and of course reviews from other purchasers.Price at Amazon:This TV cost me $999 with free shipping,  Amazon def had the best price compared to any of the B&M; stores.  From what I could tell this TV would have cost me at least 200 - 300 more in the stores.Ease of Use:I give this a definite 5/5.  Now, I do already own a panasonic but these TVs are easy to usePicture Quality:This TV has a great picture quality and I really like the THX feature on this TV.  To me it looks great.  The thing that has most impressed me about the TV is the fact that image retention is no where near the Samsung I originally bought.  I really think Panasonic has this figured out more than Samsung and LG.  On the Samsung,  if there was an image on the TV for a few minutes (not hours) the image would still show up if you changed the channel,  faintly but enough to bother me.Features:For the price this TV is a deal.1080P TVVierra Cast Internet Apps (Netflix, Pandora, Weather App, Twitter, Skype...)THX Certified3D -  As I stated before I have not tried this out yet.  This was not something I was looking for, but it was just icing on the cakeDesign:This TV is not going to blow you away in terms of design but it is still nice.  I have to admit, this is where the Samsung I had bought really shined.  But I'll take features, price, picture quality over design in this case. :)3D Experience:I have not been able to try this out, so there is nothing I can say about this.  I have been itching to get some 3d glasses and try my PS3 in 3DSound Quality:I guess the sound on this TV is ok, but I assume many buying a TV of this size and quality will want to compliment it with a nice system.Overall,  I love this TV and hopefully now that I have finally written a review my TV wont blow up!", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "6 Months Research, went w/GT25 over PK550", "Author": "Seengh", "ReviewID": "R28XMJ3I4ZY4VO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coming from a 32\" LCD, this 50\" Plasma is amazing.

I went with the GT25 for 3 main reasons; the first being that it supported 3D, the second being that there were quite a few horror stories of LG's quality control reported on various forums, the third being that the Panasonic was less reflective than the LG.The THX setting is great for extremely dark rooms straight out of the box.

After setting up the TV and playing with video/audio/features settings my frustrations began to settle-in, it was seating side by side from my old and now dying Pioneer Pro-1000HD 720p plasma monitor, and I was not able to get the same level of picture quality as the Pioneer. I returned this TV after 4 days and Amazon quickly refunded me the full amount.I'm not an expert or die-hard brand name follower, I simply look for a balance in price, features and quality since everyone's opinion should be taken as a grain of salt here are some of the pros and cons for this set:Pros:+ For the price this set could be a good deal, is less than half of Panasonic top of the line VT25 series and competes head to head with other brand's top models.+ Panasonic plasmas are very well rated for their picture quality and \"black levels\", it could be said it has cult of followers and supporters.+ Seems well built and durable but only time will tell.+ Internet Apps (just a repetition of what I already have on my TiVo and Blu-ray player)+ 3D with optional glasses (never had a chance to test this feature)Cons:- Proper picture settings are a bit difficult to achieved, either too dark or too saturated compared to my old Pioneer plasma (THX may be the only setting that I liked)- Image retention is there, even after turning off the set the ghost of the static picture could be seem (never bother with the break in period since I decided to return the set after a couple days of usage)- Lack of extra HDMI port, it should come with at least 4 HMDI ports not 3.- VGA input resolution limited to 1366 x 768, most other brand will allow full 1080p via VGA and that will compensate the for only 3 HDMI inputs.- Sound quality is not that great but can't expect that much from a flat screen, any Home Theater receiver should take care of this.- Internet Apps are not that great compared to those offered by Samsung/LG/Vizio, the user interface seems like it was designed back in the 90's.- Limited or no support at all for video file formats, tried with AVI, MP4 and even a AVCHD folder on USB drive as instructed in some forums but no cigar.- There's no DLNA support either, so you are limited to use an external player like WD Live, game console PS3/XB360 or DVD/BluRay player.- Since this set is advertised as a 3D TV it should include at least 1 set of 3D glasses and a 3D movie (not something like the Avatar package of course)Other Comments:~ Black levels accuracy, experts benchmarks, lab testing and five star reviews are not the only features that it should be consider when buying on a TV set, there's nothing like a hands-on experience and the ability to compare side by side with other sets, specially at your on terms.~ Delivery and pickup by Pilot went flawless.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Plasma is King...and this set proves it.", "Author": "Flavnet13", "ReviewID": "R1NC0L3003RH0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TC-P50GT25 available for $1K these days is a no-brainer.

Truong \"El Duke\"", "ReviewID": "R2ACFO1836DUXJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought this TV to replace my older 42 inche 720p Panasonic Plasma.  I was very happy with the quality of the image of my old TV, but I wanted a bigger TV with full 1080p and 3D compatiblity. This one seemed to fit the bill nicely.  I had been waiting for 3D Tvs to finally become affordable. When they first came out, they were around $3000 for a 42 inche.  Now that the price has finally come down to a reasonable (and affordable) price, I finally decided it was time to pull the trigger. I'm really happy that I did... because this TV was everything I had been waiting (and hoping) for.Overall performance:I've now had the TV for about 2 weeks and it has met all of my expectations. The contrast ratio (black level)  on this TV (which is 5,000,000 to 1) is astounding.When the scene has black bars on the sides, it is hard to tell where the frame of the TV and the glass screen starts when all the lights are out.  It's that dark!The many default settings such as vivid, Cinema, standard... plus the fact that you can change all the settings to your preference is great. It will even allow you to change the color spectrum to different levels of warm or cool according to your preference.  Of course, you can change setttings like color saturation, contrast, brightness...etc to your liking too. The image quality on this TV (once you calibrate it) is amazing.  If you have HD programming, you will be very impressed. Blu-ray movies look even better than they did in the theaters.3D image quality:The 3D viewing experience on this TV was much better than I had anticipated. It's pretty amazing, actually. I bought the Ultimate Avatar Panasonic 3D bundle which included 2 sets of glasses and the movie Avatar in 3D. Some things that I noticed was that the image was a tiny bit darker than without the glasses. But the TV is smart enough to bump up the luminosity in 3D mode to compensate for this. Overall this slight darkening of the scene didn't take away from the experience at all. The frame rate in 3D is really good. The TV refreshes 60 frames total so that each eye gets 30 frames per second. This is the frame-rate for normal video so your eye doesn't notice any blurring at all. I did notice some minimal ghosting affects for some scenes in 3D. This occurs at the edges of objects sometimes. I'm not sure if this was due to the way the video itself was encoded, or if it was from the TV or glasses.  I tend to think it is from the video itself because the ghosting only occurs in certain scenes and is repeated in those scenes if you rewind and play it over. At any rate, it occurred very rarely and I've read that it occurs on every 3D TV.  It didn't detract from my 3D experience because 95 percent of the scenes looked perfect!  My only complaint was that I thought they should have included at least one pair of free 3D glasses and one 3D movie (or 3D Demo) with the TV. I feel that if everyone had a chance to see how great the 3D looks on this TV, they would definitely buy more glasses and more 3D Blu-rays in the future. I bought my 3D Avatar Bundle on Ebay...which seems to have better prices. I noticed that the price here for the 3D Avatar bundle can flucuate from week to week by quite a wide range. Please remember that in order to watch 3D Blu-ray movies you must have a 3D compatible Blu-ray Player (like the Sony PS3 with updated firmware) and Panasonic brand 3D glasses.  3D glasses from other brands will not work.Conclusion:If you're looking for a great looking TV that has superb 2D and 3D image quality for an affordable price, I think that this TV is pretty hard to beat.  Prepare to spend a few more hundred dollars on 3D glasses and 3D Blu-ray movies though. This may seem like a lot... but the 3D experience really is worth the extra money you have to pay. The 3D picture on this TV display is simply amazing.Now, if you are still on the fence about whether to choose a Plasma or LCD TV, here's my two cents on the matter:Plasma VS LCD:Plasmas:Pros:-Better Contrast, Deeper Blacks-Displays more colors than LCDs can (Over 1 Billion colors)-More Affordable-More realistic (wamer) color... for example, skin tones look perfect with the right settings. Colors look more vibrant-Faster frame-rate. This also matters when it comes to displaying 3D better (faster frame-rate equals smoother picture)-Superb viewing angle... TV looks great from every angle no matter where you sit.Cons:-Uses more electricity than LCD and can produce more heat than LCD while in use.-TVs are thicker and heavier than LCDs.-Screens (on average) are not quite as bright (light output) as LCDs.LCDs:Pros:-Light and Thin Screens are easier to mount.-Produces more light than average Plasmas.-Uses less energy than plasma.Cons:-Usually more expensive than plasma.-LCDs are Backlit... which means that the black-level/contrast aren't as great as Plasma due to light leakage. Blacks look 'dark gray'  with lights out.-Screen does can't produce as many colors as Plasma.-Frame rate isn't as quick. This produces a 'blurring' effect during fast moving scenes. This can affect quality of 3D images too.-Some LCDs still do not have wide viewing angles. This means viewing images from the side affects image quality.As you can see, there are definitely Pros and Cons to both kinds of TV sets. I went with Plasma because in my opinion, Plasmas produce superior image quality and are even cheaper than LCDs.  There are many that would argue with me... but I will base this opinion on the facts. The fact is that Plasmas can produce many more colors than LCDs can, and have a higher contrast ratio than LCDs.  Contrast Ratio is the measurement of how dark the blacks can get relative to how bright the whites can get.  The technology also inherently produces higher frame-rates and have wider viewing areas than LCD. Although as time goes by, I think the image quality of these two TV technologies get closer to eachother.  If you prefer the image quality on LCDs, that's perfectly understandable.Please understand that this review is only my opinion... so please don't post a million comments on this review about how great LCDs are. Instead, you should write your own review about how great your LCD TV is ;)  Yes, I admit that I am a bit biased about Plasmas... But it's mostly because of the Pros and Cons I listed above.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best bang for you buck", "Author": "E.

Sony / LG / Samsung / Sharp /Vizio etc. I didn't limit myself to any one perticular style either, I made sure to test out the LCD the LED & the plasmas. Out of all of the TV's I tested including the panasonic VT20 & VT25 series this TV had the least amount of cross talk in 3D mode & it also runs 2D to 3D conversion. The CNET review for this TV says that 3D mode creates some artifacts but I'd love to know what they are testing it with because I have yet to see anything to make me believe that review. The G4 review says that this model is better than the VT25 series also. The ONLY time I have noticed cross talk in 3D is when watching content from my cable provider but they only broadcast in 1080i so that is the problem it has nothing to do with the tv. 2D to 3D mode is impressive on animated movies like toy story or 9 or anything like that. I've also found it to be really good on movies like Transformers,Batman & it even made watching 310 to Yuma a little better.The standard 2D picture I would say is spectacular and easily as good as any of the \" higher end \" Tv's available. I can't really comment on the sound of the TV itself as we have a home theatre setup with 3d surround sound.

But, not only did she agree with me that the TV was worth it... she actually told me I am RIGHT and that not only was it a great deal for the price but she likes it so much she doesn't want to be without 3D now!  Set up was easy.  The courier service delivered the TV and took it out of the box to make sure there was no damage.  It was WELL packaged and the condition of the packaging was great when it arrived.  Set it up and we were watching 'Avatar' that evening!  We did have to move our couch a little closer for \"optimal viewing\" in 3D, but with a little rearranging of our furniture that problem was solved. We have a large living room, the couch is now about 12 feet from the TV and the picture looks great!

After this experience, I will seek out Panasonic for future purchases, and I would order through Amazon again.Several months ago (Jan. 2010), I spent more time than anyone should researching which model should be my first flat panel TV - yes, I was the last person in America to buy a flat panel (I had a rare Sony tube with impeccable HD picture quality).  I learned that there were 47 different models to choose from just in the 46-50 inch category across the major manufacturers. LCD/LED/Plasma/DLP... Daunting.My primary goal was that I wanted exceptional picture quality.  My secondary goal - I really wanted exceptional picture quality - not explanations to why I was finding fault with what I was seeing on the screen.  Sports, movies, nature shows, gaming.  3d was intriguing, but not a priority. Most high end sets with strong picture quality are going to have 3d, which is how I ended up with the p50gt25. There was lots of press and raving about the next model up, the VT25, but the p50gt25 finds a perfect sweet spot of quality and price.I started reading about detailed information, advanced testing, gritty technical details.  I thought I needed that information to make the right selection.  Maybe I did, but in the end I'm not a guy who brings a set home and runs excessive tests to see if they meet the advertised benchmark data.  I'm a guy who watches the TV and either finds fault (and regret) with what I see or I enjoy a visually stimulating experience.8 month in and I still find myself in awe of the picture quality on this TV. My wife is tired of hearing me mutter \"I really love this TV.\"  Absolutely no regrets, this was the right TV for me.  Highly recommended.I will admit that the sound on this set probably falls short of what other models are capable of.  A non-issue when I watch movies or gaming through the surround system.  Sound wasn't nearly as important for me as picture quality. Also, I've spent maybe 2% of my time on this set with 3d content, and I'd say it's a mixed bag, but that seems to be as much related to the content as the TV.  Avatar was very enjoyable.  Some scenes within the content are stunning, others not so much.  I understand Panny has new glasses models that brighten the 3d image, and I'd be interested in that.  If 3d is your top priority, I can't properly comment on how this set compares other than to say that my experience is fairly enjoyable.Some advice - don't judge picture quality in a retail store.  Don't even try to.  Bad TVs will look good, good TVs may look bad.  There's a reason why they most expensive models are in a dark room set up in a way where there isn't 4 other TVs around it in your line of site.  And get that picture mode off \"Vivid\" as soon as you get it home! As a photographer, I find the THX mode is the right setting for me to accentuate colors while not losing details in the shadows for impeccable picture quality.I do more online shopping than most, but was hesitant on this purchase.  Even tried to get local retailers to come close to the price Amazon had on the bundle, but they wouldn't.  I made the leap, ordered through Amazon - delivery and setup were flawless.

Every review I have read about Plasmas complains about image retention.  I will address that first.Image retention is not the same as image burn in.  Now to understand this phenomenon, stare at a light source for 20 seconds, then close your eyes.  For several seconds you will still see the image in front of you.  So in a very dark room watching any TV will induce your eyes to have \"image retention\" when switching from very bright scenes to very dark scenes. Image retention on this TV is similarly annoying as the mottled look that the Sony HX810 LED LCD has in \"black\" scenes.If you plan to watch CNN or any other channel with still images, logos, etc., 24/7; a plasma TV is not for you.  If you watch alot of movies, a plasma will be a very good investment.  Panasoninc recommends 100 hours of break in before watching programs with still images that last more than 15 minutes to reduce image retention and burn in.  That figure is very accurate.  When I first got this TV (Feb 20, 2011) and set it up, I played several video games and watched movies on it.  Image retention is most noticable in a dark room with scenes switching from light and fading to black.  If you have played Gran Turismo 5, the switching screens are perfect examples.  Now that I have used the TV over 100 hours the image retention is reduced.  Image retention gets better with every day.  I believe any Plasma, just like CRT's can have images burned into them.  I have looked at new Samsung and LG plasmas and Panasonic's image retention (or lack of) is much better.2D images are just like any HDTV.  Very clear and sharp.  Blu-rays look excellent!  Colors are very crisp and beautiful.  Watching movies at night are better than going to the theater.  Very dark blacks.  Standard definition is better than the Sony HX810 LED LCD.Now the reason I got this TV in the first place was for 3D. I am glad I did.  This TV can do 2D to 3D conversion, and it does it better than the Sony HX810.  I know Samsung has this feature, but I can't say how well it does.  3D movies and games are excellent with this TV.  The glasses had to be purchased seperately, but they are very lightweight compared to the heavier glasses for the Sony. When watching 3D on this TV, you can move around and lay down and tilt your head, as long as you're looking at the TV everything stays in 3D and the image stays sharp.  Convergance is dependant on each individual and settings are either in the movie, game, or TV.  The Sony HX810's 3D is not as flexible, as in, you have to stay sitting perfectly straight to watch and tilting your head more than 10 degrees left or right, and the image blurs and no more 3D.Now to comment on sound.  Why watch an HDTV with \"SD\" sound?  I have my TV hooked up to a 7.2 receiver.  Before I hooked everything up, I did watch a few programs with the TV with the speakers on, and it sounded good, but nothing beats speakers outside of a \"flat\" TV.  The TV has audio return channel ARC, and so with the receiver hooked up, I also get the added feature of HDMI switching.  With just the TV remote, I can turn on the TV and the receiver will come on.  With everything off, I can open the Blu-ray player and insert a movie and the TV and receiver will come on with the correct inputs switched on.  The ultimate in laziness!Watching motion on this TV is excellent.  No blurring and fast scene switching.  I have noticed motion blur and induced scene stuttering from my PS3, but the TV has no problem keeping up with motion.  Compared to the Sony LED @ 240Hz, the LED can't keep up with some fast scenes. On LCD's, response times (pixel going from black to white and back to black; off, on, off) are measured in milliseconds, and the only info I could find for the Sony is between 2ms and 5ms.  Slower response times will induce \"ghosting\" on motion scenes.  The bigger the screen, the more pronouced it becomes.  But because response time is so fast on this plasma TV, it doesn't need to be measured, and picture processing is done with a 600Mhz sub-field drive.This TV has streaming internet video, and I have used the feature several times, but I'm not much on internet videos.  I also have hooked up my PC a couple times.  Don't forget that this TV is THX certified!I would buy this TV again.**8/12/11** I mentioned internet apps were lacking on this TV, but Panasonic just released a firmware update and now there are many more apps to choose from and use...  I still haven't seen VUDU for the TV, but it is available for their Blu-ray players.**Image retention is pretty much non-existant after several months of veiwing!

The images this TV produces are absolutely gorgeous. I watch a lot of movies, sports, streaming hd content and video games. It handles them all wonderfully.

I own 3D blu-rays and games, and a ps3 to play them with, but I've just never purchased the glasses nor felt the urge to watch a 3D film. Eventually I will try it.What prompted me to write this review was I recently decided I wanted to get into the HD projector game, ordering a Epson 705HD projector and 100\" screen. While the huge screen is absolutely fun to watch movies on with the sound blaring, it just doesn't look as good. Admittedly this is an older 720p projector now, but it really is crazy how spending more time with the projector makes me appreciate my 'little' 50\" Panasonic.

Standard Def. will not tell you, it will not be quite as good, nor will a DVD be very good either, so beware this pitfall.3d on this TV is good, but not as good as 2d in brightness and because of the yellow tint, but is still very satisfying. This TV likely dissipates 350 watts of power but that still is not terrible for this size a TV.The sound is not very impressive, connect the TV to at least a 5.1 system. For some reason the TV does not send 5.1 out its optical port so you have to use a new amp with 7.1 or use your blu-ray players output to a 5.1 amp or 5.1 decoder amp combo.Utube is good on the TV, the TV does not decode, Divx when smart media is inserted into the smart media port. The DLNA does not recognize a lot of media on a computer, but a HDMI ported computer easily connect to it so this is not a huge issue.View this TV in \"Vivid\" mode only or make sure your are in a completely dark room. In a show room make them put the TV in \"Vivid\" mode other wise the TV will look dull. The TV is not designed to be in a bright environment.Also beware of Fry's \"special financing\", they neglected to put it on our receipt, so we had to fight to get the 0% interest for a year deal, because of their mistake. So if you are smart wait for a sale and buy this TV for $900 and make sure you if you are buying it at Fry's Electronics and getting the \"special financing\" make sure its on your receipt in writing.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, Excellent Value, Perfect TV Upgrade", "Author": "Rosencrantz", "ReviewID": "R15D4B1484986B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing a fair bit of research on a flat-panel TV to replace my 32\" Sony rear-projection, I found the GT25-series plasma from Panasonic hit the sweet spot. Although a slight step down from the top-end VT25-series, from everything I've read you really have to be a videophile to notice the difference. I enjoy a nice picture and I like the plasma display over LED/LCD, but I wasn't convinced I needed to spend the extra to get Panasonic's top end.Once delivered, the Panasonic exceeded my expectations. Installation and setup was a breeze. I was quickly able to get all of my components working with the television, including the VieraCast network (via ethernet cable). The remote and menus are very intuitive and easy to navigate. The configuration settings for picture and sound offer two tiers of setup: one for basic settings and one for more advanced settings. The basic settings, along with the built-in picture modes, looked good right out of the box and should satisfy most consumers. Of course, the options are there if you wish to fine-tune the settings.The picture quality is superb. In a darkened room with a good quality source, plasma really shines. On \"300\", the detail was amazing and the dark/light contrast was unreal. Intensely back-lit scenes (like the sun shining out from behind a horse) made enough impact to cause you to avert your eyes. Pretty impressive stuff. I cannot overstate this point: with a good HD source, the picture is extraordinarily beautiful.I cannot comment on the sound, as I did not use the internal speakers. I will say that the Panasonic does offer a nice optical out for home theatre, but does not offer any analog audio output.Overall, I am exceptionally pleased with the purchase. I am certain the Panasonic will serve me well for years to come and, barring any huge leaps in viewing technology, won't leave me wanting for more. For a true home theatre experience, I couldn't imagine more.A few quick words on purchasing from Amazon: The overall experience was quite good. I was a bit nervous about purchasing from Amazon and not having the order fulfilled by them for such a large (dollar and size) purchase, but after reading some reviews and the Amazon shipping information I felt a bit more at ease. I wish Amazon provided a bit more information upfront on this process, however. Once you purchase the item, you're really at a loss for feedback. For those used used to being able to track everything purchased on Amazon with exceptional accuracy, this process almost seems like a \"black hole.\" The only way to get feedback on the status of the order is to contact the seller directly. To which, I have to say, E & B Electronics was very professional and very helpful. They use a third-party freight line to handle the shipment, and they were able to provide both a direct contact and a tracking number. After contacting the shipper (who again was very professional and helpful), they forwarded me on to the local van line that would be handling the delivery to my residence. It turns out I beat the local van line to the punch, as they were preparing to call me to schedule delivery (they did deliver as promised).So, all-in-all, it was a bit of a process to get the status of the order once placed. I received delivery 7 days after ordering, which is still exceptional. However, a bit more detail from Amazon as to the progress of the order would have saved me a few extra phone calls. Considering the level of service I have come to expect from Amazon, I don't think this is asking too much.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fabulous TV", "Author": "Nettie", "ReviewID": "R1U6S7QBXMV14J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are very impressed with this TV.What we like:-> The 2D picture quality is fabulous.

Since lighting wasn't an issue for me in the room where I was placing the tv, Plasma tv picture detail/quality can't be beat at any price point. The Panasonic GT25 50\" is no exception, this tv has superior black levels. When I calibrated it in 2D THX mode, the color, detail, black levels were one of the best I've seen out of the dozens of tv's I'd been comparing. The VT-25's with it's slightly higher refresh rate wasn't enough to justify the $700 price difference.  Plus, the VT-25 didn't have the 2d to 3d conversion that is pretty cool especially if it's one that actually works like the GT-25's. Compared to other ones out there like LG's new PX950 or the Samsungs, their 2d to 3d conversion was a joke. The Panasonics by far have produced the best 3D experience yet. And with the THX certified 2D picture, you can't go wrong in any price range you're looking in. It doesn't hurt that this is one of the most affordable 3d plasmas on the market either.  One suggestion though, when buying the glasses don't skimp out and buy the cheaper battery powered ones, they are very uncomfortable. Go for the newer and much better designed rechargeable ones, you can actually wear these throughout a whole movie. Last but not least, one pretty neat feature I just came across was the remote that the GT-25 comes with will control a PS 3 that is hooked up to it, also if you do have a Playstation 3 the 3d works great through it. There is no need to buy a 3d blu ray player if you have one.

I determined this TV based upon these criteria:1.  Distance - I watch TV from 25 feet away.  This meant that I needed a 50\" and above set.2.  Video Games - My son and I play a lot of games so I wanted either a newer technology LCD or plasma.  For the price, plasma fit the bill.3.  Movies - I watch a lot of horror and sci-fi movies.  They generally are dark and I wanted to have as close to true black as I can get.4.  Durability - talking to several installers, they claimed that they have the highest incidents of DOA from Vizio, followed by LG.  They have had only a few DOA on Samsung and rarely on Panasonic.5.  Hours of operation - my family generally has the TV on about 10 - 12 hours a day.  I needed something with a long lasting life.  I was leary about a plasma but these seem to last quite a long time and my last TV was kept for 10 years.6.  3D technology - I didn't care to invest in to this but for the price, I get a modicum of future proofing.I've been searching for a TV for close to a year now.  I've been picky and when this came up for just under $1000 with free s/h and no tax, it was easy on the pocket book.  I could have gone with a newer LED but you just don't get the blackest blacks from those.  So the choice settled on this.  Purchase was made on a Sunday and 10 days later, I had the TV dropped shipped to my house.Packaging:  Awesome.  Cardboard box was thick and well padded throughoutWeight:  Amazingly light ~50lbs without standSetup:  Easy setup but I left it in my front room for a full week with a set of 20 images in HD content.  I cycled through these for over a hundred hours to burn in the TV evenly.Ghosting and Image Retention:  I had a small amount of image retention at the begining when setting it up by leaving a logo on the screen for 15 minutes, but it went away within 15 seconds.  There has been very little ghosting while playing games.Games:  I actually sit about 6 to 10 feet from the screen while playing FPS'.  My eyes aren't that good and it's just easier to make a headshot at that distance.My one arguement to this TV is that you can't take a signal in via HDMI and port it out via optical to a receiver.  This means for the PS3, I ran my optical cable to my receiver and disabled Audio over HDMI.  I'll end up having to invest in a new receiver eventually that will consolidate all HDMI connections and then port them to my TV.The sound is ok.  Not great, just ok.  I didn't expect anything amazing because if I want good sound, I'll play it through a receiver.No review for 3D because I can't afford to buy 6 pairs of glasses for the family and then have a kid break a pair.  Eventually when they get cheaper, I'll invest, but we are happy to just have a TV we can see from across the room.All in all, I get a lot of wow's from people and I feel like I got a better price/value than most every TV out on the market.

I've been looking for a quality tv for the bedroom for about six months. I wasn't especially interested in lcd tv's, and initially, I was looking at various local-dimming led tv's. But my research kept leading me to plasma sets in general, and specifically, Panasonic plasma sets. As I was narrowing the choices down, I heard a lot about the rising blacks issue with Panny plasma sets (Google 'Panasonic rising black levels' to get an idea what I'm talking about). Basically, the black levels on all 2009-2010 Panny plasmas are engineered to rise in small pre-determined increments over the first 1500 hours or so of the tv. Panasonic claims this helps to extend the life of the tv (this tv is rated at approx. 100,000 hours of use -- that's about 20 years of average viewing). I was initially pretty concerned about this, seeing as how deep blacks are crucial to excellent picture quality. Since this tv has some of the best black levels out-of-the-box of any tv currently on the market, I was worried that those dark blacks would eventually turn into washed-out grays during the first year. But, this doesn't seem to be the case. Cnet has been doing long-term testing of the Panny plasmas to measure the rise in black levels. They discovered that black levels do indeed rise, but even after the rise, the black levels on this tv are still better than just about any other tv on the market. And, despite what some folks at the AVS forums who think this issue is the end of the world think, the reality is that most average folks like you and me are probably gonna have a helluva time telling that they've actually risen -- to the human eye, it's a pretty minor change.So, I narrowed my decision down to this tv and its VT-series counterpart, but looking at both closely side-by-side, I couldn't justify the several hundred dollars extra for the VT.I am incredibly pleased with this tv. Panasonic really seems to be hanging its hat on 3d plasma sets and it definitely shows. The aesthetics of the set itself are pretty blah -- it's not gonna win any style awards when its turned off and sitting on your tv stand, but I'm much more concerned with how the tv looks turned on and this tv has exceptional picture quality. The THX setting offers outstanding picture without the need to spend hours tweaking color settings. I watched the first two episodes of the BBC series \"Life\" on blu-ray, and lost count of the number of times I picked my jaw up off the floor. There was no film grain, no artifacting, no blur, and those deep blacks really make for a detailed picture (I actually saw a sleepy-seed in the corner of a jaguar's eye -- how cool is that?!).Some have complained about the lack of HDMI inputs. This set has only three, with one mounted on the left side of the tv. This wasn't a concern for me. I run all of my various components (blu-ray, Satellite, etc.) via HDMI into my home theater receiver and then out to my tv, meaning I only use one HDMI input on the tv. Right or wrong, my suspicion is that Panny assumes most people will be doing the same; hence, the lack of a fourth HDMI input. Some have also complained about the tv's speakers. Before setting up my 5.1 system, I watched tv with the speakers for about a half hour. They're not exceptional, but I didn't think they were nearly as bad as some have claimed. But, it's ultimately a moot point as most will be using external speakers.This tv certainly does deserve five stars, even though there is one area that it doesn't perform well in. SD programming on this tv looks pretty bad. This point was mentioned in several reviews I read before buying this tv. If you have a decent blu-ray player that does a nice job of upconverting, then standard dvds look excellent -- very excellent. But, SD cable or satellite channels pretty much look like crap. If you watch a lot of SD content, this probably isn't the tv for you. There are lots of other tv's that handle SD much better (heck, my two year old, 61 inch Samsung DLP tv does a much better job at SD, but not NEARLY as well at HD).But if you primarily watch HD programming, standard dvds upconverted, and blu-ray, you can't beat this tv. Especially for the price. I'm amazed at the quality for under 1k. I've read Cnet's review of the 2011 models and it doesn't seem like a whole lot has changed, but I do know that the 50 inch GT30, which is the 2011 model of this tv is gonna retail for $1899. That's almost twice what Amazon is selling this set for. And the 2011's should be hitting stores very soon. So, my advice is, if you're on the fence with whether to buy, snatch one of thes up right now before it's too late.Two final notes. I can't speak to this set's 3d capabilities as I haven't tried the 3d yet. Everything I've heard, however, indicates that it does 3d very well. And, as always, Amazon was fantastic.

I tried several LG LCD/LED television's with no success.  All of the them had motion blur and picture lag (stuttering in the picture), and a wide degree of picture quality that ranged from ok to bad.  So, I finally decided to try this plasma.  First of all, the price of this TV is great, and you should buy one before they run out and the new Panasonic models come out.  Second, the picture quality is fantastic.  The LCD's can't touch it.  The thing that impresses me most is the detail that I can pick out in the picture now that I could not see on the LCD's.  Gaming is also great, with no lag and really fine detail in 1080p.The nicest thing about the new plasma's is the technology that helps prevent image retention and burn-in.  The pixel orbiting that comes with the TV can be set and specific intervals to prevent image retention, and unless you plan on turning up the contrast and brightness to 100 (which would result in a terrible picture), burn-in would be difficult.  Still, you should go easy on the TV for the first 100 hours just to be on the safe side (break-in period).  Basically, keep the contrast and brightness down, and static images from staying on the screen for too long during that time.Finally, the shipping on this was excellent.

Thank you CEVA!No TV is perfect, and I am sure there are things that people will gripe about and what not, but this TV really has a lot of pluses, and is worth the price.  Happy viewing!UPDATE:  Just tried out the 3d features of the television.  I bought the 2nd generation Panasonic 3d glasses with the Avatar 3d bluray.  I was really impressed with the 3d, quite amazing that I was watching it in my own home!  I didn't notice any \"crosstalk\", or double images, that others have mentioned, but I really don't know how to look for it, so I guess that's plus.  I did notice that you have to turn off the lights in order to keep the glasses from flickering back and forth (florescent light causes it), which was a bit annoying but not that bad.  Does take a bit of time to adjust your vision once you stop watching in 3d.  I did about an hour to start, to avoid overdoing it the first time for my eyes.Other thoughts:Reflections from the screen are minimal.  I was worried about this coming from an LCD, but it really doesn't bother me, and we are in a room with lots of ambient light.No judder or stuttering!  I tried several of the newer LCD's before this one, and they all had the motion blur/juddering, even with the 120hz feature and the added frames.Vivid colors, sports look amazing, really a great buy.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV - 2D or 3D - Stunning Picture", "Author": "Robo21", "ReviewID": "R1NOKSZNWHX3W5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our second Panasonic plasma.  The first is still running strong after 4 years of outstanding performance.  Before buying the GT25 we decided to try a top of the line Samsung LED LCD that was an utter disappointment, more on that later.First I will begin by saying that before I understood 3D technology I had no desire whatsoever to buy a 3D set.  It was only after researching the merits of 3D circuitry when viewing in 2D mode that I pulled the trigger on this wonderful TV. Panasonic's 3D circuitry is probably the closest to cinematic 3D of any set on the market.  In order to qualify for \"True HD 3D\" the set must generate 2, 1080P images back to back.  Without getting technical, this takes powerful 600Hz circuitry.  However, I bought the TV for its superior 2D performance.At the time I bought the set there was an excellent package deal on the glasses and a Panasonic 3D Bluray player so I ended up with \"free\" 3D capability.  I will say that 3D is fun but not my cup of tea, however my wife loves it.  I enjoy it also but don't care much for the required glasses.A fringe benefit with the new Panasonic Plasma TV's is their low power consumption.  In 2D this set consumes less than 150W which is less than half what my older plasma used.  Plasmas of this type now easily compete with LCD and LED LCD on power consumption.On to the TV itself.  The GT25 is very handsome with the \"piano black\" bezel and base, even when turned off.  Unpacking, setup and programming were simple and fast.  My cable box, upconverting DVD player, and Bluray player all connect to a Yamaha RX-V567 receiver (purchased at the same time - also highly recommended) which connects to the TV via a high speed 3D certified HDMI cable.  Over the air TV audio gets routed to the audio receiver via an Toslink optical cable. We are using Bose Lifestyle 5.1 speakers which are now amazing with the Yamaha and the Panasonic.The GT25 is THX certified which is definitely an asset.  We watch our movies in a customized THX setting which gives the films a very cinema-like patina.  This is much nicer than what we have seen with the top of the line Samsung LED LCD TV which we returned after a couple days of unhappy viewing, playing with controls, and finally giving up.  Plasma is vastly superior in my opinion.Bluray performance on this set is astonishing - be prepared for goose bumps. The Infinite Black engine is awesome. After watching a couple of \"space\" movies it becomes apparent that they really mean \"infinite!\"  The blacks are stunningly deep.  Colors are very natural and the contrast is superb.  Fine tuning the picture is easy on this set.Overall this TV is a great value and will not disappoint.  One can spend more on a higher-end TV but the picture quality will be only marginally superior.  There are diminishing returns as you increase the price.  This set seems like it hits a sweet spot for price/performance.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "View the review", "Author": "spork \"spork\"", "ReviewID": "RSWBR2D4C1L6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like many on here have researched HDTV's to the point where Your dreaming about them. I purchased this Panasonic because it had the best reviews on picture and the least amounts of complaints about problems.  The Plasma undoubtedly has the clearest picture verses LCD and LED. I'm replacing a 5 year old Samsung LCD (which has been great) with the Panasonic. The Panasonic is slimmer and about the same weight, Thats technology for you. The delivery was prompt and just that a delivery, unpacked no breakage sign here. The TV is easy to set up. I have a antenna set up. Don't laugh because if you get a good HD signal this is the best picture you can get. I also have DTV. I basically hooked it up powered it up and I'm watching tv. I also hooked a hardwired Ethernet line to my home network, again I plugged it in and away it went. Very easy to access Netflix and Amazon movies. I wish it had the capability to set some different web sites other than the ones supplied. The picture was darker than I'm used to with my LCD but that was taken care of with some tweaking. The sound is not bad, not surround sound but not a transistor radio either.  The picture is outstanding from any angle. I have mine set up in a family room with 9 foot patio doors (its fairly bright) I have no problems with viewing the screen. I'm not using the 3d aspect and bought it because the GT25 is 100.00 more than the G25. When more 3d content comes out that I'm interested in, I'm ready.

Spent the entire weekend setting upthe TV and rearranging my living room to accommodate it, which was no small feat given that I have about 6 differentcomponents running through a Denon receiver which all had to be disconnected and reconnected after I removed themfrom the old entertainment center which was too small for the new TV. Ended up hanging the TV on the wall and buyinga low cabinet that fits underneath to accommodate the components.The TV and Blu-ray player with glasses all work as advertised, none of the items was defective. The picture as shippedwas on the dark and yellow side, I played around with the custom video setting quite a bit, increased the brightness, decreasedthe contrast and changed the color temperature to cool 2, which was the key adjustment in my opinion to obtain naturallooking skin tone. I know a lot of people rave about the THX picture setting, it doesn't work for me, I find it too dark.I do not have any problems with reflections on this TV, especially compared with the Philips 1080i tube TV it replaces. I playthe sound through my receiver, the speakers on the TV are OK but nothing special. I do not feel this unit produces much heatat all, after hours of operation, the back is barely warm in some spots. There can be some buzzing depending on thecolor on the screen, an all white screen seems to produce the most noise, but it is not a big issue. The TV lacks PIP, Idon't know if this is typical of plasmas. The quality of the picture depends entirely on the quality of the broadcast orvideo source you are playing, HD commercials probably look the best I'm sad to say. I played the Avatar disc that came withthe package, the 3D playback works well, but the lenses on the glasses are rather small and dark which makes the movie lookrather dark.

Most of the stuff I was looking for wasn't included in earlier reviews so I thought I'd add my 2 cents.1)  The technical manual for those like me who just want to see what it can do-2)  The 3D quality is great.  The only weirdness I've noticed is that it gets a little \"jumpy\" occasionally when someone walks by close to the camera.  It's hardly noticable though and doesn't ruin the experience.3)  Avatar 3D didn't come with the kit sold as part of the bundle.  The loyalty program specifies you had to buy it before Dec 1, 2010 (I bought on cyber-Monday).  There seems to be no way of getting this 3D movie currently.4)  The stand it comes with is just a tiny mount that leaves the TV a couple of inches above the floor.  I would have ordered a TV stand that could hold the receiver, Blue-Ray, etc if I had known that.5)  Unless I'm missing something obvious, the Netflix streaming doesn't seem to have a search feature.  You can add to your watch-instantly queue though netflix.com and see it on the list, but otherwise it just seems to have the suggestions based on the last few things you watched or rated.  Netflix streaming works great though.  If they fix this I can move my Roku to the other room.6)  The feature to automatically switch between HD and non-HD so that it always fills the screen works, but I've noticed it takes up to a second for it to switch.  Some channels with alternating analog & digital commercials then going back to HD for the content miss a second while the screen & sound are blanked occasionally.

Straight out of the box on a cable HD channel (high-end HDMI 1.4 connection) the picture was superb. No tweaking yet. I plan to calibrate it this weekend.I watched some cable provided 3D free content. It was cool - but not spectacular. Saw some \"ghosting\" (cross-talk?) of the 3D images - but at times they jumped out of the screen. I'm using the cheaper Panasonic 3D glasses (without the rechargeable batteries) and they seem to work ok except for some light peeking in from the open sides (will try at night w/o lights on). Perhaps the \"ghosting\" was due to the haunted house movie I was watching (sorry, I couldn't resist).Calibrating the TV didn't make a huge impact on the PQ other than some skintones seemed better (used the THX setting with some tweaks - see settings on the Cnet review).I just got a Sony s570 3D blu ray player and a 3D movie in the mail too. I will try those this weekend and report back on my 3D experience.So, even if I never use 3D (ya right - I will cuz i'm a tech weenie) I love the 2D picture. Oh, and I tried-out the 2D to 3D conversion - WOW - not bad for the HD Discovery channel and other 2D HD outer space/nature content that lends itself to depth/3D). Quite impressive. Glad I got the TV that has THIS feature.Delivery - I had to help the guy bring it in. TV carton was too big to navigate down a flight of stairs by himself so we carried it. Not what I expected but no biggie. This review is about the TV anyway.I'll try out the internet capabilities as well, but I'm thinking I will most likely use the Sony wireless internet blu ray player because it's - well - WIRELESS!Stay tuned (pun intended).I will report back after some more experimenting this weekend. Hope this preliminary review helps some of you that are still on the \"decision fence\". Good luck with your purchase.Update:After a whole weekend of viewing - and watching Piranha in 3D - I was entertained but not terribly impressed with the 3D presentation (although there were moments I laughed and jumped at some 3D parts. Overall there didn't seem to be enough dazzling 3D effects - perhaps the movie's fault or the TV?The movie is hilarious - and some close-ups of the Piranhas had good 3D effects in the underwater scenes (lot's of depth lent itself to 3D). I just wasn't \"WOWed\" like I thought I would be. I have a feeling any 3D TV would have provided the same result - but I don't know that for a fact.The PQ is outstanding though.PS...the Sony Blu Ray player is a really good piece of equipment. Watched a Netflix movie streamed wirelessly. Only crashed once during the movie (internet connection caused it to restart the movie). Not bad compared to the reviews on this player. Wireless Internet set-up was a piece of cake. Haven't tried the TV wired Internet capability as of yet and might not since the Blu Ray player handles it just fine. Setting-up Netflix was a pain though. Needed a code provided by Sony (it pops-up on the screen) then another code from Netflix to make the connection - all this while using my laptop to get the data from the Sony website (create an account, etc so Sony can steal my information - (that's a topic for another site).", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a Great price!", "Author": "AZ dweller", "ReviewID": "R2Q3Z5KWJSG4JQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has an amazing picture.

I could keep going but I wont. A lot of people have a hang up with plasma and the whole burn in effect, that only happens if you ALLOW IT. like if you go on vacation and leave your TV on like FOX news or something and let the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen burn in. These TVs have a setting where you can actually erase burn in.

As much as I loved this TV,I would not recommend anyone buying it because it has a tendency to go out shortly after the 1 yr warranty.It seems as though they make these TV's to only last a year or so but it took me a year to pay off this TV and I am not too happy about that.I will pay to have the TV fixed this time but never again!!", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Value for your bucks", "Author": "Justin_OrangeCounty", "ReviewID": "RKGYQZN7O3JN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best 50 inch TV you could buy for your bucks!!!

LG was the first to go so it was between panny and samsung. I got this t.v. for $999 which was an amazing deal and for the money there just was no other competition.

The 3D works great and I bought a pair of MonsterVision glasses which are super easy to use and sync immediately with the 3D TV, and one can look at the TV from any angle, get up and walk around, even go to another room and come back and the glasses will remain synced.  What I love about this TV which I'm surprised wasn't put into the newer models is the 2D to 3D conversion which I think actually looks pretty good.  You can take movies and games that aren't even designed to be in 3D and put them in 3D.  It's not as good as the picture you get with a 3D ready device but still a nice feature.  I have no complaints about this TV except I wish there was one button you could push on the remote to make it go from 2D to your saved 3D settings.

I do not hesitate to tell them Panasonic plasma is the way to go. So far I have 4 friends that have purchased various Panasonic plasmas and all of them are very satisfied with their purchase. Now on to the TV....Picture quality on this set is awesome right out of the box. I own a 42\" S2 that has a very good picture (that I have tweaked) and this set blows it away on black levels with no adjustments. Just set to THX mode and enjoy.. I am sure I will be doing some tweaking but I am very impressed with the set on THX mode with no adjustments.I have not had a chance to view 3-D content yet so I can't review that but I have read that this model and the V series are rated the highest above any other TV for 3-D viewing. This is coming from several different sources.If you are on the fence on this TV do not think twice about it, you will not get the picture on a LCD or LED that you will get on this TV, and for the money it is a no brainer. Do not go to the store and view it because the plasmas will look very dim in the store lights, you really need to see one in a home atmosphere to really appreciate the picture and it is plenty bright for those with bright rooms.Overall this is the best quality for the money you will ever find.On a side note kudos to Amazon Warehouse, I purchased a \"used\" TV in \"good condition\" on a Sunday morning. My TV was delivered that WED morning and it was brand new. I am sure that people's experiences vary but I am floored by getting a new TV for a used price and having it shipped in 3 days.

I went back and read that someone else stated the same thing. So this was very disappointing, but as I said, the 3D was not my main reason to buy the TV.  But to go online and see that the glasses go for 130+ a pair - that floored me. 4 Pairs put me at the Best Buy cost of the TV - DOH!Also to learn that they need to be charged and have to be special/specific Panasonic glasses, even more of a disappointment. My eye doctor also advised me that children under 7 should not be using these 3D glasses - that sunk me even more. So as I stated - 3D will have to wait.I can state that the 2D is an incredible picture - as I am not surprised as it is a Pany.

It was 50, but it can serve in many other ways and after some configuration (on the extender end) - I finally got the TV on the internet.  I am disappointed in the Viera Cast tools/apps. First of all - I get Not Connected to the Server every other attempt to use it, then when I get in:  the YouTube app is ok, but Netflix is very limited as you can only watch what is in your queue (which needs to be built elsewhere) - no search, no recommendations or other options that you get with the Wii and PS3 and Xbox Netflix applications. Other apps: Weather (ok may use that - but I would rather look out the window), Skype and a couple others - I will probably not use.So as a 2D television (I forgot to mention that the TV is in a very well lit room {natural light} and the Plasma has hardly any glare)- it is a 5.As a 3D TV -  major unknownThe Wifi, lack of glasses and internet apps - brings it down to a 4.If you can get this TV at a great price (999 or less) - do itI do not regret the purchase at all - just disappointed in the extras (or LACK OF).", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Mataleo", "ReviewID": "R3SWDF96WWVZ9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "first off, i am really into doing research before i purchase a product, and so far i am really impressed with this tv.

I watched IMAX Hubble, not sure if the fact that it was IMAX or the content of the DVD but it was pretty amazing. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone who is looking for a high quality picture.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price, but beware of ghosts!", "Author": "Jaime", "ReviewID": "R3I5NOZ9LWE7NY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After doing a lot of research on quality and overall value, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to buy the TC-P50GT25; especially because I got it for a RIDICULOUSLY low price.  I can't speak to how this TV compares to other 3D monitors, but I here's what I think so far after about a week of usage. As a preface, I have my BD player directly to the TV with a digital optical out to my receiver, and my cable box  and Xbox connected to my receiver via HDMI, which up converts the picture to 1080i/1080p depending on signal source.2D HD: The overall picture quality of the high-def picture is awesome. From a BD source, the picture is flawless and the overall color and contract is superb when on THX setting. HD picture quality for TV shows is also excellent, especially considering HDTV broadcasts in 720p. I was very impressed with the overall black levels and thought it was one of the best I've seen. The only display that I've watched that was better was my dad's Pioneer KURO display. My biggest issue with the set was that there is slight image retention for 15-20 minutes after an image is shown (which was reported in CNET review). It's not extremely obvious unless the image changes from a bright image to a black screen or very dark image, but, none-the-less, annoying.  As a side note, the retained image does eventually fade after a shot time and isn't burned in.3D: I was very impressed with the 3d picture, at least initially. The HD picture quality is quite good in my opinion and lacks nothing in that area. The depth of the picture is also excellent and I was having a lot of fun watching Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3D. Sick film and great 3D. My biggest issue with the 3D was ghosting. It wasn't evident at first, especially not with Ultimate Wave, as most scenes are fairly bright, but it became very obvious when watching Coraline, which had much darker picture scenes.  This was also mentioned in the CNET review, but I wasn't expecting it to be as bad as it was. There were some modifications that I made to the 3D settings on both the TV and the BD player that did help quite a bit, and I was able to reduce the ghosting significantly, but not completely.Overall, I have to say that I'm very satisfied with the monitor. I paid under a grand for it, so for the bargain, it exceeded my expectations. If you are a stickler for picture quality in 3D, I would recommend looking into something else, but be prepared to pay significantly more. If you are looking for a great overall TV at a great price, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Emrah Bayram \"Emrah\"", "ReviewID": "R2SNE6TEG60F13", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before buying this TV I made a lot of research. I also watched some in real. The funnest and most realistic 3D experience is due only with Panasonic TV's. I didn't like LG, Sony (not the most expensive one), neither Samsung tv's in comparison of 3D experience. 2D picture quality is good as well only thing you need to do with this TV is a fine tuning because default picture and color quality could be misleading. If you google it, you can find optimum settings w/o trouble in internet (as I did) and after that picture quality would change remarkably.This TV has got 4 3D modes: Native, 2d-to-3d, top-to-bottoms and side-to-side. The movies like avatar filmed in native 3d mode could be best watched in native 3d mode and this mode gives ultimate picture and 3d quality. You can also try to convert some 2d broadcast to 3d but don't overestimate it. You will never have a real 3d experience with that mode but could do some enhancements.This TV has an excellent 2D quality as well. You buy a 3d tv for same price of a 2D tv and that's why it is a real deal. I think this TV is the best one that you could currently buy for this price.

Though I still believe that my Samsung DLP set has a better picture, it's close. Part of that might be that the Samsung is in a home theatre setting where there is less ambient light. I do now see what some have said about the drawbacks of having a TV with a class screen front. It does show annoying reflections from background lighting.Hookup was easy, and the initial setup was strightforward. What a difference an HDMI cable makes!! I had forgotten that I needed two (one for the satellite receiver and one for the Blu-Ray player, and temporarily plugged in to the satellite receiver using standard cable. I switched and used the HDMI and WOW! This is using what Amazon considers it's \"budget\" HDMI cable (which, at around $10 is about 1/3 what retail outlets charge).It's been a while since I've bought any Panasonic electronics, but I would buy again (if the unit holds up). I'm a Samsung fan, and I did a lot of research on all of the brands, reading reviews from every source I could find. In the end, the combination of customer feedback, features and price closed the deal.I do have a few small gripes: 1) The set should come with a built-in wireless networking card. Shelling out $100 for the only device indicated as compatible is ridiculous; 2) The set should also come with some 3-D glasses, which also cost about $100/pair. That means that in order to go online and download a 3-D movie from Netflix and watch it with my wife I had to fork over an additional $300.. plus pay for the Netflix service; which brings me to 3) Why don't these sets come with a wireless keyboard? Surely they could provide an inexpensive device with the set. One set manufacturer (can't recall the name) offers a remote that has a sliding top that opens up access to a full (albeit small) keyboard. Nice idea, but a full-size unit would be better. I know, I know. These are relatively small nits to pick.All in all, I would give this 4+ stars out of 5... so far.

I purchased a 3d Blu-Ray surround sound system along with this tv and it's just an amazing movie watching experience.The only thing that could be better is if it had 2 HDMI ports. Since there's only one I can only hook up my blu ray player with an HDMI and then I have to hook my Xbox up with component cables. Which means I can only go up to 720p while playing xbox (boo hoo though, it's still an amazing picture).One thing I wasn't fond of was when I called the tech support for the Tv. I got some lady that was completely useless. I was trying to play my Xbox on the tv and had it all hooked up but there was no picture coming on. She tried to tell me that you could not play that console on the tv because the tv was 1080p. Though I was frustrated with the lady she did spark the idea that lead me to figure out the real problem. I just had to go on the xbox on another tv and change the res to 720p, then it came right on.Also the size of the screen is just perfect for me. I'm a gamer and a MAJOR sports fan. At first I was looking at 60' plasmas (becasuse I used to own a 65' DLP) but after setting it all up it was just perfect for our living room (which is medium sized).

Perhaps breakin will change or modulate the default settings somewhat (THX to start, as advised). But Warm2 or 1, which everyone recommends, is simply too reddish for me, preferring Normal, and I also back the color down from its default a bit. (Reruns can get blotchy in the faces otherwise, e.g., the Office.) I would experiment with Brightness (which sets black) and Contrast (which sets white), increasing both a bit from the THX defaults. I also would leave on that auto room sensor CATS, which everyone hoses on and says to turn off; if you do not, you will want to fiddle with everything during daytime watching, I bet. I find it does useful auto-adjusting.Still and all, source problems and variability show up like never before. Different cameras, the broad grayish washout some stations seem prone to, different tastes in set lighting (the Ellen show is as weirdly dark as the Mentalist almost no matter what you do, within reason), all of these entail frequent readjustment to my eye. I watched a live Celtics game and the only way to deal with its overall flat/grayish washout (slight but annoying) was to set the default black level to Dark, after which the picture was just spectacular, but which you certainly could not leave on for anything else! All very strange; someone said the TV is like a thoroughbred or high-power engine or something, and takes taming. I now think I understand that odd comment. I am coming from another v good Viera and it did not show these fine differences nearly so acutely, and its picture was awfully good. So be prepared to start with (say) the Cnet review settings and adjust as I have done above.I also got it from  ShopBroadline for $1599, free delivery, totally uneventful experience, competent, answered phones promptly and with a real person with a name, email reliable and prompt, their AIT delivery company totally competent, on time, etc. Amazing experience, amazing TV.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "My 3rd one - but why the price increase?", "Author": "AC Palmer", "ReviewID": "R2SEG9XOWA9ZS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very short version of this review - I have now purchased my 3rd Panasonic GT25 series 3D plasma.

I bought the TV for $1,200 with the 3D Avatar starter pack. I had been warned against plasma by a few friends for several reasons...1) They are too heavy. This TV weighs around 65lbs, which is comparably with a 42\" LCD television I own. A relative has an old 50\" plasma (5 years +) that's well over a 100lbs. Plasma has come a long way. This TV is mounted in a wall recess over my mantle and was easily hung by my wife and I.2) They get really hot. I've had this TV for a month now and I'm sorry to report I cannot toast marshmallows off it. After a long night of movies and the kids playing NHL11 on the PS3, this television barely gets warm.  Maybe this was an issue with older sets or other brands, but I haven't noticed any unusual amount of heat coming off of this set.3) Plasma sets `burn in' images on the screen. This was and still can be an issue from what I hear, but I have noticed no problems with this set. There are several technologies manufactures use to help alleviate this problem with modern plasma's and video gaming was my big concern with getting a plasma, but it has since not become an issue. Consumer reports noted in recent plasma tests that they found now problems of permanent burn in with any sets they tested. Although common sense should still dictate that you don't leave Call of Duty paused on the set for a half an hour at a time.The reason I went with plasma was that I needed a 50\" set to fill the area over the mantle and I couldn't find an LCD in this size. It seems manufactures of LCD sets go up to 47\", and then skip up to 54\". I saw one 52\", I think by Sony, but no one in my area had one to look at and I didn't want to order it online unless I had a chance to see it first. So I reluctantly began looking at plasma sets and settled on the Panasonic TC-P50GT25.FIRST THE BASICS:This is a full 50inch, 1080P display; the TV features 3 HDMI inputs, two on the rear and one on the side. It has 2 component inputs and a USB input as well as the capability to double as a PC monitor. It does not have built in Wi-Fi and I'm not sure about Netflix/Vuduu capabilities. I didn't look into those as I already do all that through the kid's playstation.The on screen menus are self explanatory and easy to figure out. For videophiles the picture controls offer some advanced settings for tweaking tonality and color saturation beyond the typical `color, brightness, contrast controls. The sound from the built in speakers is ok but if you are use to a surround sound system; even a cheap `theater in a box' system: the built in speakers are not going to cut it. All the inputs for this TV are on the left side of the set if you are facing the screen: side inputs and rear inputs.A WORD ON THE POWER CORD:If you are using a `slim profile' wall bracket, the point where the power cord goes into the back of the set isn't recessed far enough to allow much of a downward tilt. As mentioned before, this TV was mounted over my mantle and this may not be an issue for you if your TV is not going to be mounted up as high as mine. The slim profile bracket sets the TV so close to the wall you can't tilt it down much without the bottom of the set rubbing. And it's not really the set itself, it's the power cord sticking out of the back of the set that hits the wall which won't allow you to tilt the set down as far as I'd like. This problem can easily be eliminated by going with a standard tilt mount which would allow for more room behind the set, but I already spent $100 on this bracket and went through the trouble of making a custom recessed box for it. I'll live with it, as it's too much of a hassle to spend another $100 and do the work all over again to get another 1 or 2 degrees of tilt.THE PICTURE: Too be honest I wasn't too thrilled in the store with the picture, but the salesman assured me that the display wasn't running a high def feed and when he popped in Avatar in 3D and handed me the glasses, I was blown away. To be up front: I wasn't buying the set for its 3D picture, but this set was comparably priced to some other 2D sets I was looking at from LG and Sony, so if it came with 3D, that was just a bonus. After making sure I could return the set for a full refund if I wasn't happy with the picture I bought it and brought it home.Once set up in my home and connected to DIRECTV in HD, the picture was much better than what I saw in the store. I was instantly satisfied with my purchase. The picture is better than my LCD set, and I thought (and still think) that that had a pretty good picture. Black levels where darker than any LCD set I've seen, and sports in particular look much better than my LCD. I watch a lot of hockey and the games look a lot better on this set. As mentioned earlier there are a lot of controls for really tweaking the pictures clarity, color saturation, tonality and contrast. I did notice right away that the plasma picture isn't nearly as bright as the LCD and the TV's \"standard\" setting was actually quite dark, but there are several modes to choose from and after fiddling with the custom menu a bit I came up with a scheme that looks pretty good.When watching blurays the TV has a \"THX\" mode which does a good job of converting the films standard 24 frames a second to videos 30 frames, making the film look more like the filmmakers intended. We use this mode for watching movies.GAMING:The one area of concern I had with plasma was the `burn-in' issue with gaming. The sales rep told me that that issue has pretty much been solved and that he played his Xbox on his all the time. Of course the salesmen will say anything to sell you a set so I did a little looking around online and see that plenty of people play Xbox and PS3 on plasma's without any issues. We have a PS3 and after using it for a month I have seen no issues with permanent or even temporary burn-in.The P50GT25 has a `Game' mode built into it that will automatically come on when you play your games. When setting up your inputs you can label them anything you like. I renamed \"HDMI1\" to \"DIRECTV\", \"HDMI2\" to BLURAY\" and \"HDMI3\" to \"PS3\". I was wondering why the TV wasn't switching to \"game mode\" automatically but then it hit me. I misread the directions. I relabeled \"PS3\" to \"GAME\", now anytime the TV detects a feed coming from the \"GAME\" input; it switches to \"GAME\" mode. The manual says that the game mode is designed to give the player less latency between the set and the game console and you can adjust the TV picture just for gaming. So anytime the kids play PS3 now the TV automatically switches the picture and TV settings for the PS3. One thing I will say about playing PS3 on this 50\" plasma is `WOW'. NHL11 looks amazing, Resistance: Fall of Man is an older game and even that looks really good.3D:First off: I didn't buy the set specifically for 3D, it was a reasonably price 50\"set, so I figured 3D would be a bonus if I ever wanted to use it. But I will say this after watching the 3D demo: the technology works. Avatar in 3D looks incredible. Sharp picture, full, vibrant colors... simply awesome. I've heard several people whining about the glasses not being comfortable but that is a minor inconvenience: they are designed to fit the widest variety of heads possible. I don't expect Panasonic to make 100 different sizes and style to fit everybody's tastes, but I will say this: the glasses aren't any worse than what you have to wear in the theater now to see 3D, so stop the complaining everybody!For the best 3D picture you need to be in front of the TV, I noticed sitting off to the side, or laying on the floor, the 3D perspective shifts and you lose some of the depth. I noticed some ghosting of images with broadcast 3D but none with the supplied bluray disk. The biggest problem I found with 3D is content: there simply is very little to watch. DIRECTV has 3 3D channels, one of which; ESPN3D, never has anything on. The other 2 channels show the same 4 or 5 programs over and over and over. And as far as 3D blurays, there is very, very little available. Hopefully more content is coming, because the technology looks promising. The pictures are clear and in full color, this is nothing like the 3D from the 50's or even the 90's. On a side note: I noticed PS3 offers several games in 3D and I tried a demo of MLB11 `The Show' in 3D... this could get very addicting! Thank God NHL11 isn't in 3D; I'd never leave the house! I don't know if there are any first person shooter available yet, but I can't wait to try one!TWO ISSUES WITH 3D:Extra glasses are very expensive, so it will be a long time before my family of 5 sits down to watch a 3D movie together. Cost is also an issue because my 5 year old is not going to be putting his greasy fingers all over a $150 set of 3D glasses! Dropping them, stepping on them, est. It's near certainty that if I let the kids watch 3D television I will be out $150, $300, $450 dollars in no time.My wife noticed considerable eye strain after watching 3D for a half an hour or so. I noticed a little the first time I watched it but it was late at night and I was tired, and so I just attributed it to that. I haven't had any issue since, but this could be a problem for some.OVERALL:Overall I am very pleased with the Panasonic TC-P50GT25. The picture is not as bright as LCD but the images are sharp without being `jagged', colors seem very accurate, and the black levels can't get any better. The TV is not overly heavy and does not get hot, as some have complained about plasma's. Gaming with the PS3 is very good on this set and I have had no issues with burned in images. The PS3 doubles as a 3D bluray player and the picture is the best I have seen on any TV I have ever owned. The speaker sound was just ok, but I run everything through a separate surround sound system so this was not an issue for me. As far as a 50\" set goes, I don't see how you can beat this Panasonic for the price. Even the LG set I was looking at was priced $400 higher than this one, and that was without 3D. The picture on the Panasonic looked just as good, if not better. I've had the set a little over 4 weeks now and have had no issues with the TV what-so-ever. I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 50\" set, whether 2D or 3D. I don't see how you can get a better picture unless you are willing to move up to the high end 60\" sets selling for thousands more.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Christmas gift went over well", "Author": "J.

It swivels about 20 degrees side to side, which is nice, but the viewing angle and clarity off center is so good, you really don't need it. Picture quality is exceptional. Blacks struggle a bit, but overall, very good for a plasma. No motion blurr or grain outside of 6 feet. Very clear and crisp, and the colors jump off the screen (even in 2D).Optimum viewing distance is between 6 and 12 feet. Optimum panel mounting height from the floor to the bottom of the screen is 40-50\". Anything below 40\" and you'll struggle with the 3D glasses (especially if you watch TV in a reclined or lay-down position. The glasses and the position of the nose piece are designed to look up at the screen, no matter what the shape of your nose.Tip: BUY HIGH QUALITY HDMI CABLES. Despite what the cheap cable retailers may say (propaganda) you get what you pay for here, and cables are not included. Because the signal (audio and video) is digital, a cheap cable probably won't support the data required to transmit the 3D data. The longer the cable run, the more you should pay per foot for the HDMI cable. I paid $150 for a 24' HDMI cable after trying a thin $50 cable with a cheap termination connector.If you don't have a home theatre sound system or preferably an amplified Dolby 5.1 audio reciever with HDMI video pass through, you won't be impressed with the speakers in the TV. Panasonic is not known for its audio performance. That said, they make a great line of plasma HDTV's. This one is no exception, and the 3D performance is second to none...if you purchase high end HDMI cables. Best set-up is to run all HDMI connections (cable/Sat, DVD)through a good audio reciever (Denon, Onkyo), then from there to your Viera 3D plasma. You'll need a newer audio reciever with pass through HDMI... so the video and audio signal will \"pass through\" the audio reciever from the source (cable/Sat reciever and DVD player).If you have the right set-up and the purchase the right hardware, you'll be ready for the 3D content and IMAX-like movie experience.

In fact, this is my first. As you can see, I gave a very bipolar opinion on the star ratings. The truth is, the TV worked beautifully while it was working. The key to that last statement is \"while it was working\". That said, I purchased the TC-P50GT25 Viera TV through Amazon on 3/8/11, and received it on 3/16/11. It was a personal birthday gift to myself (3/20/58), and I loved it. I bragged to everyone about it. Then, on 5/3/11, it just died. Just a flashing code on the power button. It was picked up for repair on 5/6/11, where it remains to date (5/20/11). That's just 48 days that I actually enjoyed it, and it has been in the shop for almost half that time. No updates or information on the progress of these repairs, just a quick brush-off when I call this \"repair shop\". I finally got some info from Panasonic last week that the part needed would arrive on 5/12/11, and no other info until today, when I was told that the part was on back order and that they (Panasonic) reserve the right to keep this status going for 30 days before the next course of action is determined. I'm at the point where I either want a new TV or my money back, but there is no satisfaction there either. I also did a little research through the BBB and the FTC, and my understanding is that if a complaint is not filed within a certain period of time, the recourse is null. I think that's enough to make anyone unhappy, to say the least. So if worse comes to worse, and they refuse to honor or back their product, I'm not only out the cost of the TV, but also the blu-ray player, 3-d glasses, d-link wi-fi network, and the extended warranty that doesn't even go into effect until after a year from my purchase date. My next question is what kind of products is Amazon backing here. Just 18 days after the cut-off date for returns, and I'm left with no recourse here either. Sorry for the long-windedness, but the details had to be expounded for the whole experience to be appreciated. I sincerly hope that this all has a happy ending, but right now it's difficult to see that happening. If anyone out there has an answer to this experience, I'd greatly appreciate it.5/24/11- A little update on the above review. After the encounter with Panasonic listed above, I contacted Amazon and they agreed to take the TV back for a refund, which I plan on using as payment for a 73\" Mitsubishi. This was the TV that I originally had my eyes on when I decided on all this. Practicality and 2nd guessing myself got the better of me, and this, in my experiance, is always a mistake. Also, I'm not much for extended warranties, but this being a major purchase, I bought the Panasonic 3 yr. coverage for this TV. I don't know if this is standard for extended warranties, but when I more closely read the coverage form for this warranty, I noticed that the starting date for this coverage began in 2012 and ended 2014. Which means that they are adding the initial 1 yr warranty that comes with the product to the total 3 yr coverage and charging the full amount. I may be a little unknowlegable in these things, but it seems to me that the extended warranty should go into effect after the initial 1 year warranty and cover a full 3 years beyond that point. But that's just me , I guess. Well, overall my experience with Panasonic was not a very good one. In fact, in my opinion, Panasonic bites! On the other hand, Amazon Rules!

It's everything I expected. I have another panasonic 720p 50' which works great so i kind of expected the quality. so far i have hooked up my cable, xbox , laptop, DVD and all of them work great. I have yet to add the LAN but haven't gotten to it yet. I was comparing it to LED samsung (because this TV was for bedroom ,which was to be dark), i found the light bleeding in the samsung to be too much to pass off. Design could be better but no major issues. Picture is really sharp . You will not get a better TV at this price range (900-1000).Delivery : Used standard Home Direct. You will not believe this. The TV sat in the local warehouse for 4 days( from trackeing info) and moved only when i called up amazon( while i was talking to amazon and the lady who heads the delivery here, they called my wife to setup an appt for sat). The guy said that they had forgotten about it . They forgot that they had a TV to deliver !!However, next day they called in to say that they don't deliver on saturday ??? probably they were just trying to appease the amazon lady who was on the phone with me at the time they setup the appt.They setup for monday evening, I left from work early so that i can have the delivery and on way to my house they again called to say that they forgot to load the TV to deliver. ( It took them 1 hr from delivery time to figure that out), you would think that deliveries start early in morning and not at 5.00pmThey finally delivered next day on the 3'rd time.AMAZON really needs to work on this.add-ons : when i called to complain , amazon credited the delivery charges to me . Also, because i almost cancelled my order in frustration, I  was shopping around and found a better deal on the TV elsewhere.

First attached TV to stand and noticed that the set was crooked - the right side was about half an inch lower than the left side.  HD video looked great (if you don't use the TV for gaming it does look awesome!), but at 50\", this set was just to big for my small living room (10' from set).  I hooked up our Wii and it looked awful - blurry image and very aliased lines, then the PS3 and it looked better than the Wii, but not good (again very aliased lines).  I decided to return the set on Feb 13th, called Amazon and they said no problem.Home Direct USA picked up the TV for return on February 17th and that was the last I or Amazon saw of the TV.  When I had not received my refund by March 8th, I checked with Amazon and they said they had not received the TV.  I found the tracking information and found that the TV had not moved since it was picked up.  I contacted Home Direct USA on March 9th, they said they would check on the TV and call me back - never heard from them again.  Called Park Transfer & Storage (who actually picked up the TV) twice on March 10th, both times was told they would check where the TV was - never heard from them again.  Called Amazon on March 10th and asked what I needed to do if the TV was \"lost/stolen\" in transit.  They said if they didn't receive the TV by 30 days from pick up, they would refund my money.Waited till March 19th which was 30 days after TV pick up by Home Direct USA and called Amazon for my refund.  Was told by Amazon that since it was a Saturday they could not return my money because Home Direct was not open and they would need to find the TV!  I told him that the TV was stolen, that was the point!  I was furious!Called Amazon back on Monday, March 21st ready for a battle, retold the whole story and was immediately refunded my money.  Had the refund by March 23rd.Amazon was very good about the return (other than the weekend staff), but I had to wait over a month for the refund, because Home Direct USA \"lost\" a 50\" Plasma.

Together both worked very well for small townhouse living room.We wanted try 3D T.V since price getting lower from last Christmas so we purchased from Panasonic with shipping free.Ok, good points are all same as 5 star rating folks. I totally agreed. This T.V is really good quality. Compare with old 50\" plasma lighter, thinner and elegant looking. T.V stand round and smaller in this model.So I would not talk about good point here.BAD's are...1. Not included 3D glasses and complimentary 3D disc.(how can you test your T.V's 3D performance without paying extra nearly $300 to get those optional items? If the T.V has 3D features, they should included all those items for test when received T.V even paper glasses and 5 min 3D show disc is fine by me. I would never know if the 3D feature is defected or not without spend more)2. Mail in rebate Avatar 3D disc with purchase proof.( Why don't you sell with included? why customers have to wait for mail in claim take 3-14 weeks!? come on, don't be stingy!)3.NO AUDIO OUT PUT!!! but it has digital(optical)audio out ONLY.So if your home theater few years old with using red and white audio connective  and doesn't have optical audio plug, you cannot connect your home theater.Now I have to buy new home theater system from Panasonic....(not necessary from Panasonic but it's nice to connect with Viera cast)I really wish I can use my old home theater system...Basically they drooped old technology on this unit.

I know everything is going super high tech and it's almost impossible to keep up with it all and everything we buy today will be obsolete by next year, but did they really have to omit an SVIDEO input on this set? Was it so much more costly to keep it on the set??? And if you're used to using wireless headphones when everyone else in the house is sleeping, they omitted the audio outputs also. Do I have to buy a new amplifier for my bedroom now just to use my wireless headphones???When did who, ever take it upon themselves, to change everything that has always worked, to what they like only and omit the things that already do work? This is just like the latest cars and trucks that have electronic heat sensors that regulate what the heat/air is to the sensor, not to what me and everyone else on the planet knows what 72 degrees feels like. If the sun is beating on the windshield in the winter, the 70 degrees my heater throws out is cold to compensate for the sun........DUH!!!Will they ever get it right with just one set? The picture is nice enough, nothing so fantastic that you will never go to the show again, and the 3D is capable of entertainment, (long use of the glasses will make us all blind in no time!), but do they actually explain anything you need in the instruction manual, or is all what they think you need??

The only thing that I've found to be disappointing is the performance of the 1080p24 input. At 48hz the picture really is unwatchable due to the flicker (per other reviews). If there's anything that Panasonic can do to fix some of the flicker in a future firmware update, they should do so immediately.That being said, it is very, very difficult to find fault in the 60hz mode.
