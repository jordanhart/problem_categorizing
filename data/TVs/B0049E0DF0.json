From the old red/green modes, the the better red/blue, Linear Passive, and the latest Circular (RealD\u00a9)Passive, and finally the active (shutter) 3D. Each one has their advantages and disadvantages (color issues, ghosting problems, headaches, etc), but the one type has never been brought to the small screen... until now.Recently I visited a local store, for a basic test on how the technology stands up. I am one of the approximately 30-40% that can't stand watching active 3D via the shutter glasses (headaches in my case), so already this has an advantage. I went in and took a pair or RealD glasses, even though the salesman had a pair of LG glasses for use. This TV can accept 4-5 types of 3D encodings (over/under, side-side, different meshes), and has the option for converting 2D to 3D (most of the time not my cup of tea). I did try the 2d-to-3D, and slipped on his pair of LG glasses... and astonishingly, it's magnificent, and very detailed with the 3D on (The trailer was Open Season). After this, I tried the RealD glasses... and voila, same good results. Even with 2D conversion, the glasses you get at the theater works perfectly with the LG, despite the news articles posted elsewhere on various sites. It does come with 4 glasses, compared to 2 on the active 3D sets... and glasses average around $10 (the price of a matinee 3D movie), though now you know you can buy RealD glasses. The clarity otherwise is as expected, vivd and bright with the 1080P Blu-Ray player hooked to it, and great sound.So if you wish to buy a 3D TV that:- Has cheaper glasses- can be viewed by 90% of the peopleBy all means, buy this one. You won't regret it.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG tops my list", "Author": "R. Shaheed", "ReviewID": "R35W6VYVS9TQ1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd LG hdtv - with the 1st being a plasma 50 inch hdtv.  I enjoy the plasma , but this 3D lcd is breathe taking... Picture quality is sharper and visuals that I get from my directv hd box is stunning. Just saw Avatar and I was amazed at the quality and clarity of the movie because my plasma does'nt match the quality of the picture. 3D is another subject...it is beautiful and everybody should give it a chance especially with these 3D sets becoming more resonable priced. The only thing I don't need that this hdtv offers is the 240hz motion options-it's useless and doesn't help motion pictures at all.  Other than that buy this tv and you will not be mad with your purchase.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture in 3D & 2D!", "Author": "JCEck", "ReviewID": "R3QYJXBYFPXIO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for about 6 weeks and it has surpassed all of my expectations.  After a complete renovation of our home and the addition of a home theater, we were looking for a TV that would fit the space and provide high quality picture clarity.  When we began our search we really didn't give much thought to 3D, do to the hassel of the traditional shutter glasses and the cost associated with having several pairs on hand for visitors.  After we learned about this TV we thought that it would be a good choice, although we purchased it sight unseen.  When it arrived set up was a breeze and I quickly looked for our cable provider's 3D movie choices.  The selections were very limited but I decided to watch \"Avatar\" and was shocked at the terrific 3D quality. Combined with our Bose surrond system, my wife will have a hard time getting me to go to the movie theater ever again.  If you're considering buying a new TV, do yourself a favor and take a look at this one. Many of our friends and family members have purchased new TVs in the past year and our LG 950C blows all of them away in traditional 2D. Now, if only my cable company offered more 3D broadcasting (particularly ESPN 3D) my home theater would be Nirvana!", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not bad. Had to change my review", "Author": "David Washington \"little dave\"", "ReviewID": "R2O886VY1V9IOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture ranges from very good to ok depending on the source.  I have read some reviews and agree with those saying if you have the tv above eye level, lean it a little towards you the picture is better, especially the 3d movies. The 3D is excellent, I actually prefer it over the active 3D tv I have, and it seems to have a little more depth to it. My PS3 would not pair up with the TV at all. I notice the TV says 1080i and not 1080p.  Not sure if the tv will not play both or not yet.  The HD channels look excellent, if recorded in HD.  Directvs 3dnet is an excellent source.  Would love to be able to review the blu ray 3d, will have to update that once I get another 3d blu ray player. The 3d passive is very nice....no more headaches.  So now I have everything...watched Avatar and most recently Ice Age 3 and I love the 3D on this television.  Even converting 2D to 3d looks good on this television.  Gald I repurchased this. I still have my 60 inch 3D but I don't like the active 3D.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible Picture!", "Author": "Coach D \"Coach D\"", "ReviewID": "R1D2W2R8GRD1QE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wouldn't write it if it wasn't true.

I will never again purchase anything from Circuit City again, directly or indirectly.The TV is great.  The picture, whether normal, HD or 3D are amazing and the 3D glasses are actually comfortable.
