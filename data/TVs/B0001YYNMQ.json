Ulrich", "ReviewID": "R3Q7PVYZ4ZTACV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had this TV for about 2 weeks. It produces an unbeliveable picture in HD almost photograpic. Like one of the other reviewers I am running Comcast HD so I came in on a DVI to HDMI converter cable. If you look on the net a little you can find the cable for about $25 (computercablestore) instead of the $120 for the Monster cable. The audio on this TV is also one of the best I have heard. Almost sounds as if they have put in a subwoofer, the bass is very deep for a TV. Standard TV also looks better than a regular set. If your looking for a great high-def set this is it.", "Date": "August 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "BUYER BEWARE!!!!!", "Author": "Buyer beware!!! \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "RU3S7SWAZTA5N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Watch out for those new or used plasma TV being advertised for less than $1500.00.

Sharp Aquos) over plasmas, mainly because the LCD screen lasts longer, is brighter, consumes far less electricity, and does not suffer the burn-in problem as plasmas.But if you are set on getting a plasma, this Panasonic \"Veira\" 42\" is one of the best plasmas on the market today.  This HDTV set (with built-in HDTV tuner) is fully 720p and 480p native, and can scale 1080i content gracefully.  (BTW there's very little 1080i content available right now.)  The picture quality is simply gorgeous, with brightness and details that rival LCDs.  Color reproduction is excellent, making watching Nature on PBS such a wonderful experience.  The screen's response time has improved over earlier models, so fast-action sports looks good instead of ghostly.  The Veira also has a Cable Card slot and although I haven't tried it, a recent New York Times review says it works seamlessly with Cable Cards.  (Cable Cards can replace set-top cable boxes; check with your cable provider for details.)To get the most out of DVD movies, get a digital-output (HDMI) DVD player from Panasonic, Sony or Denon.  These players can \"upsample\" DVD's standard-NTSC resolution and provide somewhat better video quality when you play DVDs on an HDTV like this one.  The Panasonic player in particular is a great value and a perfect match for the Veira.While I still think LCD TVs are a better value for the long term, the Panasonic, along with plasmas from Fujitsu and Pioneer, does give you the best possible picture out of today's state-of-the-art plasma technology.  I have friends who own Panasonic and they are all very happy, even the ones with the EDTV (instead of HDTV) sets.When you buy a big screen TV, you are making a serious investment (unless you just won the Mega Millions or Powerball), and I highly recommend you buy the best you can afford.  Sub-$2000 plasma TVs have poor image quality and are likely to break down quickly, plus they are very noisy.  Just go for the best after you get over the SAF (spouse approval factor) hurdle!  The Panasonic Veira is a great value considering its top-notch image quality, gorgeous styling and built-in HDTV support.", "Date": "December 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great TV, and I wish there were more HDTV channels", "Author": "Japinder Singh", "ReviewID": "R3IHNNJZ2P3OPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After researching and looking at plasma, lcd, lcd projection tv's for couple of months, I finally bought this TV from amazon.com. Had it for couple of weeks now, and am amazed at the quality of the display. Got HDTV from comcast cable and the HDTV channels look and sound great. Of course I wish there were more HDTV channels. I recommend using the Monster DVI-HDMI cable. This TV has a HDMI port. I also recommend Samsung DVD player HD-931 that generates HD outputs via DVI for your DVDs. The resultant image quality is excellent, even though it is not \"TRUE HD\".An update. It has been a year since I last updated this review. This TV is still one of the best plasma displays in the market. Pioneer plasma is the only one that looks slightly better. I have added monster power supply to my setup and have replaced the cable with satellite. More HD channels on the satellite. Monster power supply is essential to keeping your expensive home theatre setup safe from power quality issues. Have also added Onkyo A/V receiver to my setup along with Cambridge speakers. Had zero issues with this display. Was a little bit apprehensive of dropping big dollars on this display. But so far, it has given awesome performance and zero problems.", "Date": "July 13, 2004"}, {"Title": "Glitch in the TV", "Author": "JDev", "ReviewID": "RONU7C98XFXJX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this plasma TV through Amazon 4 months ago.  The transaction and shipping went very smoothly. I also purchased the wall mounting bracket through Amazon (an excellent value for only $150).The TV is great -- excellent picture and great audio for those of you who do not use their surround sound system every time the set is on.  However, a problem recently surfaced a few days ago: When playing DVDs on the Component 1 channel, the picture on the screen is no longer centered -- it is offset by about 20% to the left side.  After trying to remedy the problem myself, I contacted Panasonic Customer Service (be prepared to wait at least 20-30 minutes on the phone before being connected to a representative).  After explaining the problem, the rep indicated it would warrant a service call by a repair person (as of this writing, the appointment is scheduled within the next few days) Luckily, the warranty covers in-house repairs for one year, but you do have to remove the TV from the wall mount yourself so it is accessible to the repair person.I'll admit I'm a bit skeptical about the reliabilty of the TV now, especially since it developed this problem within 4 months.  I'm not a fan of extended warranties (very expensive for this TV, considering an extra year of coverage through Panasonic costs around $400), but I may have to purchase one if any additional problems surface.Hopefully, the problem with my Panasonic is a rarity.  I  expected better performance from this expensive purchase.

But I almost fell for this one. A seller had the TV listed for $990. She even had 69 positive ratings next to her name, 'torrter77'. When I emailed to ask why the item was priced so low, 'she' said that her ex-husband had cheated on her and she was trying to get rid of anything that reminded her of him. She sent us to a 'secure' website to make sure our transaction was guaranteed. If you are ever sent to '[...] know that you are being scammed! Luckily, my husband did some research on the site and realized the whole thing was bogus. She even tried to have us go to Western Union to send money to Paris.

Cronland", "ReviewID": "R1IAXT4N0A3MV6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, the Panasonic 42PX25 is truely an HD unit (not EDTV). It has all of the same tech specs (plus more) as the main competitors. It is bright and crisp. Normal TV signals (via a cable for instance) look lousy since the display is capable of so much more, and kinda amplifying the poor standard TV signals.  BUT, throw a DVD, HD or even DIGITAL cable signals at it and be prepared to fall off your chair! Amazing!This unit has LOTS of signal inputs, and the built-in ATSC HD tuner even finds HD channels my cable provider (comast) says don't exist on my wire!The unit suffers from the same power supply noise that nearly all plasmas do. Almost non-existant, but if you put your ear up to it with no other sound in the room, it IS there.The embedded operating system is a bit sluggish, and switching between video feeds is a bit slow, but usable. Also, it is quite particular in which types of image files it will display. I have found ONLY images that have been recorded on a camera work. Nothing that has been EDITTED first displays.Last note: The unit is plasma... which means it's USEABLE half-lifespan is something like 50,000 hours. What is a half-life span you ask? It is the number of hours that the set is operating before the BRIGHTNESS degrades to HALF of the original brightness. So, in 50,000 hours, the picture will be 50% darker than it is today. This figure of 50,000 hours appears to be higher than other sets.

We don't yet actually have HD but the picture is still great...I can't imagine what it'll be like with HD.The only problem on the previous model was that the remote was cheap-looking and made badly.

McWhirter", "ReviewID": "R1XX6AAPORQQYY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my set for about 2 weeks now, and I am blown away by it's contrast and resolution.This is my second set...the first set arrived and when I plugged it in, all I received was a blinking power light---turns out it has something to do with the power supply---according to Panansonic.I use Radio Shack 'rabbit' ears for my reception and receive all four of the major networks and OPB in HD---Monday Night Football in HD is amazing!  With the 'rabbit ears' I also receive all four major networks in SD---but why go back?DVD's seem to look better on the Plasma than on my last Mitsubishi tube set---even thugh there is only 480 lines of resolution.  I haven't tried the HDMI input yet, but others seem to be impressed by it.I am using component video for my DVD and run the sound through Yamaha Audio/Video controller, Adcom amplifiers, and Polk Audio speakers.The only bummer is that when the speakers on the Plasma are turned off, you can't adjust the 'volume level' using the Plasma remote---you just get a message saying 'speakers off'---you should be able to turn off the speakers and then have the audio out from your Plasma become a 'line out' so to speak---so you can control the audio levels of your surround system, when watching TV by using the volume on the Plasma remote control---why should I have to 'select' receiver and then adjust the volume?---heck that was available on my first Mitsubishi set 16 years ago.Anway, minor complaint....all in all a fantastic set, that I would recommend to anyone---and a great bargain too!", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R5QG5WD0OX095", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am thrilled with this TV.

Before you plunk down the BIG bucks for a plasma TV, look for other ways to spend $ around your house or take a vacation instead. Plasma TVs are underwhelming when all is said and done. Wide-screen programming is virtually non-existent, and resolutions are awful when you try to watch converted analog signals or stretched screens, also very dissapointing to view the dead-zone sidebars when you can't fill the screen. I spent 4Gs on this Panasonic and two months later the entire image skewed off the frame, needed a technician to reprogramme the bios (on site), ughhh, after hours of wasted support calls to both Panasonic and to my cable TV provider (both apparently ignorant about the issue).
