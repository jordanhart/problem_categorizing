{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great quality television", "Author": "Short", "ReviewID": "R3KWE03T3QCR4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't have a lot of high definition (HD) content available to me, but this TV does great with standard definition TV and DVDs. The black levels are darker on this generation than previous year Samsungs. I personally don't like the look of Plasma TVs, and LCDs are still a little expensive for the largest models, so right now, DLP is the best type of TV technology for larger sizes at a reasonable price.Be sure you use the best possible connection from your video sources to this TV for the best possible picture. Hopefully you have at least S-Video (out) on your satellite or cable box and component (out) on your DVD player. Get some good cables (gold connectors), but you don't need the very high cost premium cables.I also looked at the 50\" and 56\" versions of this TV, but this size is the best for my room based on viewing distance. IMO, you should choose the size of your TV based on the viewing distance. A rough formula is to divide your viewing distance (in inches) by 2 and also divide your viewing distance by 3. Your TV diagonal size should fall between those sizes. In my case, our viewing distance is at about 12 feet (144 inches) => 144/2 = 72 inches, and 144/3 = 48 inches. Then pick a TV with a diagonal between those numbers.The lower end of the range will be more like your standard TV viewing and the upper end will be more like a movie theater, \"immersive\" experience. Choose what's best for you.EDITUpdate as of October 2006: We still love this TV. There are other reviews here that indicate bulb problems. If your bulb does go out, it is a user repairable item, no need for a tech to look at it. Just order from samsung's replacement part site. Bulbs should last for about 5,000 hours. That's the only downside to this TV, the bulb replacement cost.", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "I am now a vegetable...", "Author": "S. Elvin", "ReviewID": "R3LPKUE9YKS4NP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is a great value! I have it hooked up to a Media Center PC and have had a permanent smile ever since. I found that this television was brighter and clearer than any other DLP TV. I am not sure if it is typical, but I ordered this TV through Amazon and the delivery crew brought it into my house and hooked it up to make sure it worked. I would recommend this TV to anybody.Also, the only problem I had hooking it up to a PC was that it MUST use a VGA cable (HDMI-DVI does not work on this TV from a PC.)", "Date": "August 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Love It So Far", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R1CWLLDA3L0N3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV two days ago, delivered and set up by Eagle Freight.  Very happy with the order/delivery experience.  Although I would suggest you take the initiative and call Eagle freight as soon as your tv makes it to its destination.  Mine arrived last Friday, but wasn't \"scheduled\" to be delivered until the next friday.  I called them, explained that the TV had arrived and if I could schedule delivery sooner, which they happily complied with.  Two guys arrived right on time and brought the TV in, let me fiddle with it all I wanted before I signed the form (I was worried because the box had been severely damaged, and the internal styrofoam was munched, here's to hoping that nothing later will develop, but the TV was apparently unharmed) (aside: WHY does samsung use such cheap packing techniques for these TVs they know will be individually sent to customers via freight??)So they unpack it and take the box and trash away, and there I sit with my new toy.  I fire up ESPN HD and am a little disappointed with the picture quality, but reserve final judgment until I work out the kinks.  Right off the batt, I realize I had the picture zoomed from my cable box, and was outputting 1080i instead of 720p.  Once I fixed that things were instantly better.  Then I adjusted the factory picture settind and got the picture looking great.  Monday night football looked absolutely supurb!  I had originally ordered the 6187 (1080p model) but it was backordered, so I cancelled and went with the 6186, for six-fifty less!  I figured that because my main facination with HDTV is for sports, and that ESPN and other broadcast in 720p (I think NBC is 1080i), that this is the best sports can look, as I can't see the networks ponying up to switch all of their new expensive equipment to sitch to 1080p anytime soon.So what do standard definition broadcasts look like? Well.... its garbage in, garbage out here folks.  Some look \"OK,\" others look terrible.  And then there are some that look absolutely wonderful (like HBO, for example).  Yes I wish some of the standard def stuff looked a little better, but it doesn't really bother me that much, as the shows I watch are mostly prime timw network stuff that's in HD or sports...So all in all I'm happy with the TV, but very nervous that no problems develop, because Amazon won't be there to help at all, and I've heard nothing but horror stories from people dealing with Samsung customer service.  But I guess that is what you get for a much better price.Oh and by the way, don't get ripped off when buying HDMI cables, you don't need the $100 monster cable.  Check the AVS Forums and the like, it just isn't necessary.  There are sites that have great quality cable for MUCH cheaper (m o n o p r i c e . c o m) is one of them, that's where I got mine, and it works great.", "Date": "October 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great picture for a short while", "Author": "WCarne1069 \"wcarne1069\"", "ReviewID": "RM2VZC8F9PZVC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this TV last February and have enjoyed great picture quality until recently when the bulb in the picture lamp assembly blew.

I received my Samsung DLP in early March. The delivery was just as Amazon and Eagle promised. I was impressed with the delivery.But after returning home from work and plugging the unit in I noticed a noticable high pitched humm coming from the back of the unit. I may return this and get a higher priced model. I was concerned with the price of this unit. The fact that it was about $500 less than comparable sized screens. The humm is not real noticeable, but you can hear it when the room is quiet and the unit turned off, like in the morning when I am putting my shoes on for work.The viewing angle is also kinda off. You need to be right in front and sitting down to get the optimal picture. Great for regular watching, and movies. But I like to watch TV from the kitchen when drinking beer at night, and the picture quality is a little off when off to the side, and a little higher.Overall, I am impressed with the picture quality, aside from the viewing angle issue. The first DVD I watched with this set was 'Bullitt' last night. I could make out a little \"rainbow effect\" during more black and white scenes. But it wasn't too annoying.For the price, it's not a bad unit. And this is my first large screen TV so I have nothing else to gage by. My only major complaints would be the high pitched humm, and viewing angle issues.I got this TV for 'March Madness', and 'March Madness' thus far, looks pretty good on this unit.Like most of these reviews. Most are posted shortly after people receive the units when they are most happy. I will try and post here after having the unit for several months.", "Date": "March 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Samsung HL-S6186W 61\" DLP HDTV", "Author": "T.

The Sony was a 1080p and cost $1300 more than the Samsung which is only 1080i.  I decided to buy the Samsung based on the following.1.  Currently, no cable or dish provide broadcast at 1080p.  They only broadcast at 1080i.  So why pay more for a for something I can't get anyways.2.  When it's all said and done, I'll be saving almost $1300.3.

I sit about 16 feet away and finally can hear, good sound, and see everything on the screen.  Might be lower priced units or more expensive, but this one has met and exceeded some of my expectations.  The delivery took only 10 days and was in perfect shape when received.  Help in getting in house and was timely in making and meeting appointment time. Set up was easy and has great control of color, tint, sound, and overall picture quality.  I cannot see a big advantage to the 1080p over the 720p.  I have clear crisp picture.  When viewing on 4:3 mode the screen narrows to diagonal of 50 inches.  Take that into consideration when buying, not all viewing can be accomplished on 16:9 mode, so the screen is smaller from my satellite feed.", "Date": "December 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Charles Titus", "ReviewID": "R25G7D5HKV7OLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it from Amazon and saved a ton of money over the stores!

I even went into several stores to look at it in person. The TV itself is great looking. Very sleek. But the picture looked horrible in Circuit City so I was leaning towards the Sony Bravia. My cousin who works for Bryn Mawr (who only sells top of the line products) told me the Samsung was the best, and they have the fewest trouble calls (which is what he does.) He also said the TV and the warranty from Amazon were the best deals anywhere. He told me that they looked bad at Ciruit City becuase of the signal that they were sending to it, or because they intentionally \"de-tune\" the pictures of some TVs in order to promote ones they have higher mark-ups on. (Like the Sony) We went back to Circuit City, and got the remote for the TV and adjusted the sharpness and put it on an HD channel and it was simply amazing. Bought one that day and had it in the house 3 days later! The Super Bowl looked amazing on it in HD and my family loved it so much, I ordered a 2nd one on Sunday Jan 20 and my father had it in his house by Tuesday January 22nd and he loves it as well.
