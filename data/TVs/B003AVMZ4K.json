{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Magnavox brand", "Author": "the contented cat", "ReviewID": "RITII61YJGBPX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The screen on this set is very bright.  It was a bit challenging trying to adjust the brightness.  The picture quality is very nice.  You will get the full 22 inches on some programs and about 19 inches on others.  I am using my set with a hdtv aerial.  I get as many as 53 channels with the aerial alone.  I do not have cable.  I purchased a Phillips aerial for this set, but it would not properly go into the cable fitting.  So I am using a Radio Shack antenna instead.  The set is lightweight.  The stand is lightweight.  I would not recommend it for wall mounting.  I admire the Magnavox name and I am happy with this purchase.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Supports 1080i,720P,480i,480p\nSide PC Input,2 HDMI inputs\n1366x 768 WXGA res\nSleep Timer, auto shut off\n5 band EQ and ECO", "Name": "Magnavox 22MF330B/F7 22-Inch 720p LCD HDTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31H8wUznOHL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003AVMZ4K"}}
