Picture color and model style are excellent. I've been looking at the Aquos model for two to three years. No other brand or model was even considered. The LCD display is as beautiful and colorful as Sharp claims. Very happy with my purchase. Delivery was the only problem. It took way longer than estimated and I blame that on the shipping company, so don't be impatient, especially if you live in a rural area.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Crystal shap picture quality....Best i have had so far.", "Author": "Sam \"Scalion\"", "ReviewID": "RO4MUJP1URSBB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with this TV.

Yu \"GBUA\"", "ReviewID": "R39OINYH59NFZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have this unit for 3 years before the screen color turn to blue. I bought this unit from Circuit City on Black Friday with my 2 other friends. One of my friend's TV got toast with the same issue after 2 years and at that time I thought maybe he got a defect one until the same issue hit me a year later. Call customer support twice but no response at all. I know it had been three years so no more warranty left, but with Sharp Aquos quality, this TV should last at least 50,000 hours. Sharp is not stand on their product by not even responding to the customer question. They can at least pinpoint the problem on my TV. I checked on the internet and finally realize that this is a common issue for Sharp Aquos owner, the screen turn color or go blurry. This unit might has issue with their controller board. I will give Sharp Aquos 4 stars for their picture quality but give them zero star if I can for their customer service and hardware quality. I will definetely go to Samsung or Sony for my next purchase. I would highly recommend you not to buy Sharp TV product if you are looking for a TV that can at least last you more than 8 years or 50,000 hours.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "SHARP LC-42D43U Aqous LCD", "Author": "Richard C \"richard c\"", "ReviewID": "R390MDBF9AB7VP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this 42\" Sharp Aquos LCD TV @ Sam's Club Black Friday sale in Oct - 2007..
