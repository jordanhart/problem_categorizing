{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very pleased with this TV", "Author": "KAC", "ReviewID": "R2LK37EWNULOGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased so far with this TV.  I have bought several large flat panel TVs over the last few years and this one I am really pleased.  I have been pleased with Samsung in general and only buy Samsung now for displays/TVs at this point (have 4 large screen TVs and 5 monitors in my house).  As others have mentioned, it is a new model for this year and really packs a ton of features in for the price.  I love plasma (over LED and LCD) and was really surprised how the weight has come down.  The picture is great.  One feature I really wanted to make sure I got was the ethernet input because with more and more stuff moving to internet, I felt it would be a good idea to have.  I am finishing a basement and have the opportunity to run the ethernet right to where i will put this tv. Don't get me wrong, the built in WIFI works perfectly too, I just wanted to have this option too and many other models don't have this.  One thing I was not aware of is that it doesn't have a VGA input.  I was planning on using that to hook up a computer.  For me its not a big deal as I can use HDMI, but thought I would mention as I didn't notice that before ordering.  Overall I think this is a great TV and a great deal - would definitely recommend and I am seriously considering buying another one for another room (yes, I have been told I have a problem with buying too many TVs).UPDATE (4/15/12) - After several days of usage, I noticed a buzzing sound when sitting in just the right (or wrong depending on how you look at it) place.  Sitting directly in front and about 8 feet away I noticed a pretty load buzzing sound.  If I moved closer or to the side I did not really notice it.  (I couldn't really try moving back based on the way the room is where I had it).  I actually wasn't sure what it was at first and I turned everything down and could still here it.  I then traced it to the back of the TV and sure enough I could tell it was coming from the TV.  I took the TV back because of this - I am not willing to live with that.  I really like the TV and its features otherwise, so I ordered another one and am awaiting delivery from Amazon tomorrow.  I did some research and it seems this \"buzzing\" issue has been experienced by other people on a variety of Samsung plasmas, but I'm hoping its just luck of the draw and I get one that doesn't do it this next time.  I have two other Samsung plasmas in my house already (older models) and have never had any issues.  I'll post an update when I find out if this new one does the same thing.UPDATE (5/5/12) - So I received the new TV from Amazon and it works perfectly.  No buzzing sound with this one.  So I'm back to being very pleased.  As I mentioned in my initial post, I was seriously considering purchasing another one and in fact I just placed that order tonight.  Here's hoping I get one without the buzzing issue again because its really a great TV for the money.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "The PN60E6500 is well worth the extra $200", "Author": "J. Beecher", "ReviewID": "R2U11O2LN6CU9V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The product photo for these TVs (the 550 series) shows a matte, anti-reflective screen. This is misleading. The 550 series does NOT feature an anti-reflective screen. It has no anti-reflective coating at all. It is as reflective as glass, and consequently not the best choice for rooms with windows.Amazon's product description for the 550 series is identical to its description for the next model up (the 6500 series). Reading the two descriptions, a reasonable person will conclude that the only difference between the 550 and the 6500 is the type of stand that the TV sits on. In particular, both TVs are said to feature a \"Real Black Panel\" and both screens are shown with the same matte finish. So why not get this TV (the 550) and save $200?Here is the crucial difference: This TV (the 550) has the basic \"Real Black Panel,\" which Samsung describes as an \"advancement in software technology that provides deeper and darker black levels for bolder hues, higher contrast, and smoother, clearer picture quality.\" In other words, the basic \"Real Black\" is purely a function of software, not of anti-reflective coating.The 6500 on the other hand has \"Real Black Panel Pro,\" which Samsung describes as \"An advancement within the panel structure of the plasma and a software improvement that depicts blacker blacks, bolder color, higher contrast and exceptional picture quality. This technological improvement provides the most cinematic viewing experience available.\" In other words, it has the software as well as the anti-reflective coating that distinguishes the high-end Samsungs. Amazon mentions that the much pricier 7000 and 8000 models have \"Real Black Panel Pro,\" but neglects to mention that the 6500 has it too.Again, it depends on the lighting situation in the intended room, but in most situations, the 6500 is well worth the added expense.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "A High Class TV at a Common Man's Price", "Author": "HarvDog", "ReviewID": "RQCRYSN65W5NQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Summary:If you are looking to get an amazing TV at a fantastic price, you've come to the right place.  This TV has an absolutely fantastic picture, surprisingly good 3D features, and an array of useful Smart features.  Whether you're a movie fanatic, or a hardcore gamer, this TV will certainly impress.  Add in the features of the TV on top of the outstanding quality that Samsung continues to deliver and then look at the price, and you have a no competition situation.  Take it from someone who normally has buyers remorse, I love this purchase and have no remorse over it.Picture Quality:The picture quality on this TV was a huge surprise to me.  I had read the reviews on here which talked about the outstanding quality and Plasma's have always impressed me more than other TV technologies, but this TV was absolutely outstanding.  This TV looks great not only on HD, but even on SD content.  I have Charter Digital Cable with HD and my box is hooked up through HDMI. As one would expect the HD channels look great.  What really impressed me is the crispness of the TV on even SD content.  Most SD content is filmed in 4:3 aspect ratio and on large HD TVs such as this one, they tend to have issues with pixelation.  The picture on this TV is sharp and clear regardless of the stream quality.Sound Quality:My apartment isn't particularly huge and the sound on the TV is not necessarily something to speak of, but it is surprisingly good.  For a normal sized room it gets the job done.  My next investment is a full surround sound system and when I get to that point, this TV is equipped to handle it with the optical audio out jack.  In the meantime though, I can continue to enjoy the sound quality the TV has built-in.3D Content:When looking for a new TV, I really didn't find the idea of 3D all that appealing.  It's just not really a major deal to me.  My thought was that it's a nice bonus, but it's not really a deal maker for me.  Knowing the price of this TV as compared to other 3D TVs, I didn't particularly have high expectations for the quality of the 3D content.  However, when you switch on the 3D mode and enable 2D to 3D up-converting - it is surprisingly great.  The TV includes 2 3D glasses and additional glasses are $18/each through Amazon.  Very reasonable and the 3D effects look impressive.  I've tried the 3D mode on a 3D enabled Blu-Ray, normal TV, and a non-3D xbox360 video game - each of these just looked great in 3D.  The 3D effect on this TV is into the tV versus out.  You sort of get this impression of looking through a window into some sort of realistic looking scene.Shipping:I was lucky enough to get Free Shipping through Amazon and the shipping included White Glove service at no extra cost.  The delivery was very fast.  I ordered the TV, had it in less than a week.  The delivery company unloaded the TV from the truck, carried it in, unpackaged it, attached the base, and plugged the TV in.  They then turned the TV on and checked it to make sure there weren't any problems with the picture.  They were friendly and professional and they arrived precisely on time of their scheduled delivery.  Now I just gotta decide where I'm going to store this giant box.SMART features:The SMART features are nice to have.  I've tested the wireless features of the TV and it works well.  However, I prefer to have the TV wired (just for network speed and reliability)  and the SMART features are very responsive, non-glitchy.  I've mostly used the YouTube player.  The downside of the YouTube app on the TV is that it treats it as a mobile app and so YouTube filters out popular content and all Vevo content is unavailable despite the fact that it shows up in searches.  This is really a problem with YouTube's own policies and restrictions versus the TV's.  The rest of the apps work well and were well designed.  The Pandora app is excellent.  The TV even comes with an iPhone and Android app which will allow you to control the TV wirelessly from your phone.  It's nice to have but I'll stick to the real remote.Bonus feature is that when connected to the network you can stream content from an DNLA or Windows Media client directly to the TV.Customization and Ports/Plugs:The TV gives you so many options to adjust the picture to fit just your taste.  For me, I didn't have to do very many adjustments to make the TV look phenomenal.  It looked amazing right out of the box and with some slight tweaking it looked nearly perfect.  Whatever your taste, the TV gives you plenty of options on how to adjust the picture for your room and content-type.  Also, the TV has plenty of HDMI connections and audio out to hook up most equipment.  The other benefit is that each input has its own configuration.  You can setup different profiles for each HDMI port.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Value...do Calibrate the TV", "Author": "David L Dalley", "ReviewID": "R2U2CMLBF7PUCC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for over a month and this TV is a solid 4 stars. This is my second 60\" set, with the other set being a Sony edge lit television (Bravia KDL-60 EX 720). The 2 sets vary on the tech used and with that said, there will always be a some subtle distinctions between the two. The Samsung is fully loaded and you cannot beat the value for the cost. The set up is straight forward but you will not see what the set can do unless you invest in a calibration disc (any DVE disc about $20) and take the time to fully tune your TV. Once you do this the \"Oh my God, what a picture\" will really start to kick in.There are comments about a buzzing noise. I do not have this issue however I did use the included magnet filters that are designed to wrap around the power cord at both ends. This is not well documented and there is only an included pamphlet to shows the owner how to do this. As such, it can be easily overlooked and the filters can be discarded in error since it is not something most TV owners have to implement. Power lines in general carry a lot of interference and can generate noise in electronic devices. The purpose of these 2 included filters is to eliminate this noise. They are pretty heavy duty and one is required on each end of the power cord. This only tells me that Samsung was aware about this being an issue. They could have built this into the power cord, but I feel they probably discovered this after the fact. So if you are going to buy this set...and you should...make sure you use them.Overall its a Fantastic value and with proper calibration, a superior product for the money. Get one before they are discontinued with what is sure to be a higher priced model.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice set, great features, lots of tweaking options. Problems with fade to black movies, random auto brightness and slight buzz", "Author": "Baz", "ReviewID": "R3UBJPQ0V69IV8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "**Have only had the set for 4 days, still tweaking settings**TheSamsung PN51E550 51-Inch 1080p 600 Hz 3D Slim Plasma HDTV (Black)I purchased this set after returning an LG LED 47 inch Cinema 3D set, the problem I had with the LG set was the sports and HD in general looked really washed out and messy; after several days of tweaking the settings nothing seemed to help. I then stopped researching LED's and jumped to researching new model Plasma's. I'm an owner of an older Panasonic 720P 50 inch plasma that I purchased from Fry's for less than $600 like 4-5 years ago and I felt it was time to upgrade. After researching the options within my budget the Samsung appealed to me because of the 600hz motion drive (sports in mind) and the Cinema Smooth features for Blu-Ray movies - the 3D and 2 free glasses was a bonus and so I pulled the trigger and went for it.Shipping:I had to schedule an appointment with Pilot shipping services and I had to wait about 6-7 days until my set arrived. I was able to get the set 1 day early, called them early morning to see if they had my item and they were able to reschedule to a earlier date. Packaged arrived prefect with no issues whatsoever.Now for an actual review of some content I have tried on this set so far. My first post was more of a calling out for some help with an issue I noticed when watching Hockey (I will get into it in my review) with the intentions of coming back and updating my review which is what I'm doing now.HD Sports:The first thing I tried on this set was the HD Sports - Mainly Basketball and Hockey. I'm currently a TW cable subscriber and using a Motorola cable box that supports 1080i using a \"Premium\" HDMI cable utilizing the first HDMI slot on the set. The basketball game looked decent but the picture could use tweaking but out of the box it was decent. I noticed some motion blur and some artifacting when the players moved up and down the court. The colors stood out, and they looked very good, not some washed out mess like the previous set I had purchased and returned. The next day, I tested my set with Hockey and here is where I noticed the odd issues with the brightness. The television set has tons of features and options available for the end user to tweak and adjust which I truly love. I made sure that all eco settings, energy saving settings and auto brightness settings were turned off and they were. While watching the hockey game, I noticed that the brightness or the cell lighting of the actual screen would auto brighten and darken when the camera moved up and down the ice following the players. This is something I was not able to fix, I tried everything I could think of and finally contacted Samsung for some help. After talking with Samsung they're fix was to Factory Reset The Settings....I LOL'd at this and moved on the research and attempt to fix this problem my self (which I have not yet, still researching). One thing I did notice is the preset I'm currently using \"Standard\" has the energy star logo next it which is leading me to believe that the preset might force energy saving features even though I have set them to off. Overall the Sports look great, the set may require some tweaking depending on your setup but out of the box, the picture quality for HD programming is very nice.Blu-Ray viewing PS3 using HDMI:As soon as I got my TV, the setup was a breeze, since all of my components are using HDMI, it was really easy to get everything connected but I ran into some problems with my PS3 picture to actually show up on the screen. At first I was using the third HDMI slot on the set, while my Xbox 360 was using the second. The set would recognize my PS3 and it would show up in the source list but the picture was not coming on. After resetting my PS3 video setting by simply holding down the power button for 5-7 seconds - it still would not come on. I started to get nervous, I went online but did not find many answers, maybe a few posts about it but it all went back to resetting your PS3 video settings which didn't work for me. I refreshed the source list using the tools button and the UI and still nothing. I shut the television off and the PS3, unplugged the HDMI from the set and replaced it to the second slot and move my Xbox to the third slot, turned the PS3 on and my TV and bang it recognized it. Not sure what the problem was but moving it to the second + resetting the ps3 worked like a charm.Now came the time to test movies, mainly blu-rays. I tested a range of movies that I have in my collection - Star Wars, Scott Pilgrim and Batman (to name a few). Out of the box, with zero tweaking, I was not really impressed but I knew that I can really get the picture quality and a higher level with all the nice features and tweaking options available on this set. After some minor tweaking and turning Cinema Smooth on, I started to notice a slight difference. The action scenes were a bit smoother, the blacks were looking really nice but the whites could have used some more help. I stopped tweaking for a while and just sat down and watched the flick and I must say I was Impressed but I kind of wanted to have what people call \"The soap opera effect\". I feel the cinema smooth feature doesn't add too much to picture quality but just enough to make it pop. Overall, I'm enjoying the set for watching movies, with some minor tweaking you can get the set to look good but with some advanced tweaking you can really make the picture quality look very nice.I went ahead and purchased the Disney WoW calibration disc and it arrived just in time for me to tweak the settings even more - if you want an easy tweaking guide, get this Blu-Ray on Amazon. It's a nice disc to have handy so you can attempt to get the best possible picture out of your new baby :).Gaming:I am a gamer at heart, I own a ton of video games and have from old school to new school gaming console's in my collection. I'm a big fan of run and gun games, FPS, Action and Adventure games with the occasional RPG. I have not really gotten into gaming that much on this set but have tried two games so far - Battlefield 3 on my Ps3 and Modern Warfare 3 on my Xbox 360. Modern Warfare 3 played really well, the details and backgrounds were okay and the picture could use tweaking and sharpness tuning but overall the smoothness was noticeable and I was very satisfied. Battlefield 3 on my Ps3 on the other hand did not look so good. I was just done tweaking my ps3 settings and my set for movies so the gaming did not look good because it was set up for movies and not games. After playing a few rounds with my current settings, I then went into the menus and turned on the gaming mode which turns up the contrast to full blast and the cell lighting as well. While playing a few rounds in \"Gaming mode\" the only difference I noticed is that the menus responded much quicker in-game and the menu on the television set as well. I'm pretty satisfied with the smoothness in games but my intentions are to tweak it because gaming is a whole other monster and will require some love. Overall - the blacks, smoothness look really good on this set when gaming and with some adjustments you can really get your games to look fantastic.I will definitely come back in a few more days to update my post with some more gaming and of course the 3D and the apps which I have not touched yet.Lastly I want to say that I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase but for now will have to give it 4 stars and here's why. Only 3 HDMI slots are available and I'm using all 3 which leaves little room to add components like a receiver or soundbar; I would love to have had at least 1 more HDMI slot for this reason being able to add. Another reason why is the picture quality for sports and gaming. With the weirdness of the auto brightness and the BF3 not looking all that great this also factored into the 4 star rating.If you're looking for a set under $1000 with tons of features, 600hz and 3D, this is the way to go. I love the options that are available, Cinema Smooth is a very good feature and the UI is pretty easy to use.Update 5/26:I was watching Super 8 on blu-ray last night and I noticed some odd issues when the television set transitioned to credits at the end of the movie. Basically, when the screen when black then to text then back again to black; the television began to flicker like if the television wanted to shut off. I did that for quite some time and I quit out of the movie because I thought It was going to burn out. Contacted Samsung and they're blaming my PS3 Slim or Monster HDMI cable.Update 6/5:As much as I loved how HD Cable looked on this set, I have returned it back to amazon due to problems that came up after a few weeks of use. These can be small, picky issues but they bothered me so much that I had to return the set.1. This I already mentioned in an update here or the original review - Brightness pops when watching hockey. I could not take it anymore, the screen was starting to quickly flash every time there was action. I noticed this a little for Basketball but very noticeable in Hockey. The brightness would automatically dim or return to bright levels randomly.2. Fade to black problems when watching Blu Ray movies, the screen on the set will start to flash on and off. I ran into this problem when watching Thor and Super8.3. Buzzing sound started at a certain level and distance, close up you can't hear a thing but at a distance, the noise is noticeable.4. Not much of a difference when turning Cinema Smooth feature on when watching Blu-Ray movies - I watched Movies from Action to Pixar flicks and didn't notice any change.Like I said, HD sports look pretty good, Blu-Ray movies are Okay, buzzing sound is there and random brightness pops suck but overall the set is okay - I'm just really picky.Oh and for some reason I was able to control my PS3 with the Samsung Remote - It could have been due to the type of HDMI cable I was using not sure but that was really cool - No need to buy the PS3 blu ray remote, I was able to pause/play movies and control the PS3 home screen as well.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't beat it's price performance!", "Author": "P.

When re-sizing the window, however, the brightness returned as I made the window smaller  (i.e., when the TV was displaying less \"white\" on the screen).This effect disappeared, however, when I set the \"Cell Light\" setting to around 10, rather than the highest setting of 20.After consistent experimentation for the past week, it's clear that the dimming happens when:1) The TV is told to display mostly white content2) The \"Cell Light\" is set above 10 or soNote: This effect occurs even when \"dynamic contrast,\" \"eco mode,\" and every other similar setting is disabled.Pros:-TV/Movies look fantastic (if you're watching at night, or a room without big open windows --  blinds/curtains are required with big windows)-Excellent color reproduction (unlike LCDs/LEDs)-Inky blacks-Great 3D (compared to my \"3D Vision\" PC gaming monitor, which was almost as expensive)-Cool Features & mix of settings-INCREDIBLE performance for the priceCons:-Glare-Dim compared to LCDs/LEDs-Cannot maintain high brightness when displaying mostly white (or all-white) content.Bottom Line:If you're not concerned about glare, and can leave the TV set to a medium brightness (i.e., if you watch TV at night) then this TV is AWESOME.At this size, similar models cost hundreds more.  Personally, I can't justify doubling the price just to make the TV bright enough to watch with window-blinds open during the day.  I can pull my blinds if it saves me $600 on the TV.UPDATE 1/30/13:The ability to play videos (TV/Movies/etc) with a USB memory stick is probably the TV's most useful feature.  I now have a 64GB thumb-drive which I use quite frequently to watch TV shows or movies that I have stored in avi or mkv format.Also, sometime in the last few months Samsung finally added the HBO GO app to the TV.

It came on time and the delivery guy was courteous. He opened the box and removed the TV and powered it on to make sure it was working just as Amazon described in their service. No complaints there.Initial Impressions (After 1st week) -Initial setup was simple. There's a setup guide that will take you 5 or 10 minutes to set up date, time, wifi info, etc.Picture quality out of the box was good. After going through the picture settings briefly I got it looking a ton better but I still need to tweak them a bit. Overall, though, the picture looks amazing. Very crisp. Definitely one of the best pictures I've seen on a plasma. I have yet to try video games as I'm still breaking it in but cable tv looks amazing. (I have a fios set top box as my cable service.) I'm also planning on getting the TV professionally calibrated so the picture should only get better.I'm coming from an LCD so the overall brightness of the TV seemed a little low but I was expecting this. Considering how great the picture looks, I don't mind. Plus, at night, with all the lights off, this plasma is plenty bright. As with just about all plasmas, this TV looks even more amazing in the dark.The smart hub is good. I know a lot of people say it's pointless if you own a ps3/360 but I disagree. I own both and I still like the convenience of being able to access internet apps without switching inputs and remotes. The 3D is also good, better than I thought it would be. 2D to 3D to conversion is mediocre though. The 3D glasses work great and are nice and light. I wore them over regular glasses and it was very comfortable.Now the bad -The TV came with a dead pixel near the lower right portion of the screen. It's only visible when your face is a few inches from the screen though. It's impossible to notice from any further back. I dont mind because it can't be seen from where I normally watch TV on my couch. Plus, I don't want to go through the hassle of exchanging it just for 1 pixel.There is a very, very slight buzz that comes from the TV. It's only noticeable when the sound is muted. It's so subtle that even when the TV is on low volume you can't hear it so it's not an issue for me.These 2 subtle issues are the only problems I've had thus far.Miscellaneous -One of my biggest fears when buying this TV is the \"brightness pops\" people were experiencing while watching hockey games. I'm happy to report that I'm having no such issue. I put on NHL Network multiple times to see if anything weird happened with the brightness but it was just fine. The only thing I noticed were the camera flashes which I hear are noticeable on many plasmas.Overall I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The picture quality is awesome, the 3d is impressive, and the smart hub is a nice touch. All these features overshadow the single dead pixel and the (very) minor buzz. I'm not ignoring these issues though. It's what stopping me from giving it 5 stars. But again, they're so minor that the good outweighs the bad. If you're looking for a good quality plasma that has all the bells and whistles at a good price then look no further. I would absolutely recommend this plasma.I've only owned the TV for a week so I'll post an update with more details on the 3D, video games, and blu-rays after I properly test them.Update 8/22/12:I've owned the TV for over 3 weeks now and I couldn't be happier. I got the picture calibrated and it looks amazing. I tested the 3D some more and it is very impressive. It's fun to watch something in 3D every now and then. I can see myself doing it just because the quality of the 3D is nice. The 2D-3D conversion is still nothing special though. I don't see myself using that feature too much. Video games look spectacular as well. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and absolutely recommend this TV to anyone with a low budget looking for a plasma. Don't let the dead pixel discourage you, I had forgotten about it until I came back to write this update.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Jimmy", "ReviewID": "R1JI2LLGL8KEXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this bad boy just in time to see OKC Thunder smash the Spurs!  I originally bought last years version of this tv (D550) in the 59\" but I took it back to the store because I wanted the bigger 64\" for my mancave in the basement!  I'm glad I did too because the newer year (the E550) came as a smart TV where last year did not have the smart capabilities built into the 550 series TV!  On top of that I also got this one from Amazon's Warehouse Deals.  I was very skeptical about buying something like this used, but the condition said \"Very Good\" and it was coming from Amazon, so I took a leap of faith and bought it.  Nothing is wrong with it and it looks like it was brand new!  I'm so happy!  This used, newer, bigger, and better with more capabilities TV was only $1500 when I spent more than that on the smaller 59\" without the \"Smart\" capabilities.So far everything has worked as expected: Pandora, Netflix, streaming downloaded movies from my computer.  I haven't really had a chance to play with all the other apps that comes with Samsung's Apps.  Picture is excellent.  This is a Plasma and does have a little bit of glare in my walkout viewout basement with windows opposite the TV, but it's just a little glare that you would have to be looking for to actually notice, but once I got it mounted on the wall with a tilting mount I can't see any glare.  This TV is also just hands down good looking.  I know everyone always tries to say that Panasonic Plasma's are supposed to have a better picture, but if you ask me the whole TV just does not look as good as the Samsung's.  No regrets here.  I was suprised that my 10 year old son while walking by the TV during the game got stuck in front of the TV and watched the game with me.

The three star rating means two things:One: I really like the unit and am satisfied with my purchaseTwo: There are things about the unit that limit it from being the best.Pros:Size is gorgeousHD source image is really solid3D looks really goodFree glassesPrice is super competitiveCons:Very reflective screenDoesn\u2019t get very brightVery slight (negligible) buzzFirst of all let's make it clear... despite my four star rating, after using the set for a month I am very pleased with this unit. Would I make the purchase again based on its performance and the prevailing prices of this tv and its competitors.... 95% sure. I must say I love the size. The standard definition image/processing leaves a lot to be desired but this is the case with most HDTVs and besides you buy HD to view HD, and the HD quality is good.On the downside the TV is very reflective there is no getting around it. I have huge glass double doors as well as two sets of windows in my viewing room which means I must draw the drapes to enjoy my unit during the day. Additionally, the TV doesn\u2019t get very bright. (not so dim that it degrades the viewing experience but limits performance in bright room situations. If you can control ambient light in your viewing space, then this will not be an issue for you.Also there is a very slight buzz sound and I mean very slight. You only hear it when you are in certain positions relative to the tv and the volume is really low or muted. You don\u2019t hear any buzz in 99% of any normal viewing conditions. Even when muted you still have to be in the \u2018wrong\u2019 position to hear the buzz. I understand why it is part of the discourse about the tv but don\u2019t think it warrants some of the harshest of criticism.My biggest peeve about this tv actually is the paucity of tweaking options. They are way too limited and some are grayed out altogether. Nonetheless you still get a very good image without much fiddling so you need not be too concerned here.Second to size, 3D capability was the most important feature for me with this set. For me it really enhances the viewing experience of animated movies (which seem to be the ones most studios convert to 3d\u2026 probably because of the ease). There is very little ghosting (none perceivable in animated movies) minimal amounts in live action movies. It is most perceptible in stationary menus and some fast moving images when they are close to the viewer. Not sure if this is a function of the actual image capture/rendering/processing or the performance of the tv itself. One other fact related to 3D performance to be noted is that the image is a bit darker when viewing 3d (due to the tint on the glasses) but this is hardly a deal breaker. Oh and by the way, the included 3D glasses are good. They are lightweight (some say flimsy, I say you don\u2019t get anything sturdier in the cinema, why else would you need more for your home?!). My only gripe with them is that their \u201copen\u201d design lets in more ambient light than is optimal but it really doesn\u2019t distract from the viewing experience. Movies viewed in 3D so far include Prometheus, Men in Black 3, Rio, the full Shrek Collection and Megamind.Smart tv features. Sorry didn\u2019t get the tv for it and if I could have paid less for the unit and have the smart tv removed I would have. I have a PS3 with Netflix and web browsing capabilities and that is satisfactory for me. The web pages load a lot faster with my PS3 and using the remote with the Smart tv is a real waste of time. You could type an entire 500 word essay on your laptop before you could input amazon.com with the tv remote! (okay slight exaggeration but you get the point.). See another owner for a more detailed assessment about the smart tv functions. Wish one of these tv manufacturers would leave off the smart tv and further reduce the price so I could get a \u201cdumb\u201d 3D tv for less.So why would I buy it again? The next best 60\u201d TV is more costly and doesn\u2019t come with 3d glasses (unless you buy the step up Samsung model). I have owned Samsung TVs and other products and have always been satisfied. Nothing that I count against this tv outweighs the cost and performance values of the unit and I can honestly say I am happy with my purchase. The more I use the tv the more I enjoy its performance.

Coming from a 50\" Sony rear-projection behemoth, this was my first foray into the world of flat panel televisions and I'm thoroughly impressed with this set. I was initially looking for a TV without 3D because, let's face it, it's more of a gimmick than anything and thus far the only really well done 3D movies are either animated films (Pixar, Dreamworks, etc) or Avatar. Regardless, I kept coming back to this TV because of the extensive feature list, deep picture customization options, and fairly large app ecosystem.-- Picture --I am very pleased with the picture of this television and the ability to tweak it to my heart's content. I used a calibration disc Spears & Munsil High-Definition Benchmark Blu-ray Disc Edition [Blu-ray] to get the picture just right, but the same information could just as easily be found through Google. Each of the three HDMI ports have their own unique picture profile as well, so you can get really specific about what each source looks like. The 600Hz + Cinema Smooth has a more subtle effect on the picture, as opposed to the \"soap opera effect\" you get on a majority of 120/240Hz LCD panels out there; rather than create a clearer distinction between the foreground and background, I believe this television strives for a faithful reproduction of what the director wanted you to see. It works remarkably well when given HD content either through your cable provider or a Blu-Ray player like PS3 and even does it's best to make SD shine. The only downside I've found with this TV, as other reviewers have noted, is that in a bright room you will experience some glare as it's not a matte screen. It doesn't really bother me since the television is capable of getting extremely bright to offset it, but it is worth noting.--Sound--There are trade offs to having our televisions this light and this thin and the first thing to go is audio quality. There's only so much you can get out of the two 10W speakers here, but a plethora of customization options allows you get things sounding pretty good by making some bass/treble adjustments and volume hasn't been an issue as the set can get really loud. Ideally, you'll want to look into hooking up a sound bar like VIZIO VHT215 Home Theater Sound Bar with Wireless Subwoofer or a full surround sound setup of your own machination. Again, let me reiterate that the audio here is fine, but probably the weakest point of this package.--3D--I figured I would give this a shot since I had it, but was incredibly skeptical of it. The good news is that Samsung throws in two pairs of 3D glasses, so no additional purchase is required. As fate would have it, the 3D version of Avatar was released on Blu-Ray the day before I received this set so I picked it up for testing purposes. I will honestly say that I was very impressed with the depth this television is able to reproduce. After testing Avatar I decided to try some of the 3D content that Comcast provides in their OnDemand service. I played Rio 3D for my daughter and it looked positively stunning. I also fired up my PS3 to test out a few 3D-enabled games like Arkham City, Uncharted 3, Super Stardust, and more. All of it was really well done, though for gaming I'll admit it feels more like a distraction. I went in with very low expectations and was blown out of the water by how well this television performed in the 3D arena.--Gaming--I'll touch briefly on this, but I'm be remiss if I didn't at least mention this TV's Game Mode. I'm a pretty big gamer and thought the picture looked pretty amazing with my calibrated settings, but I wasn't expecting such a shock when I turned Game Mode on. It basically removes almost all of the processing the TV has and sets a custom contrast, sharpness, and gamma. The result is an incredibly crisp picture that improves visibility as well as response time, which people who play twitch shooters like Call of Duty will certainly appreciate. The only thing that struck me as odd is that this setting is tucked away on the second page of General settings, which makes it a little tough to find. The good news, however, is that since all HDMI channels have a unique profile, you can enable it once for your console input and then not have to worry about it again.--Nerdy Stuff--The Amazon description and reviews don't do justice to the media center capabilities of this television as well as some of the more technical features. The first really neat feature are the Smart Apps, which are actually quite numerous and cover the gamut in terms of functionality. I first installed all of the video-related ones like YouTube, Vimeo, Netflix, etc. The interfaces for each are pretty similar to others you may have used on Xbox, PS3, Apple TV, and more and all work wonderfully. There are additional apps for fitness, yoga, and many other things which all work great and are simple to install. It's also worth noting that this television has just shy of 1GB of available storage for installing apps, which was a pleasant surprise. The built-in WiFi works great and was able to connect to my network in a snap. In fact, the first thing that happened after connecting to the network was a software update for the TV, so it's good to know that Samsung continues to update and support their numerous product lines.As far as I'm concerned, this television is the best media center I've ever owned. I have a good deal of digital media that I've ripped from physical discs and keep on a single USB hard drive to bypass things like unskippable ads, FBI warnings, etc. If I plug this hard drive directly into one of the two available USB ports it's instantly readable by the TV and I can play them right from the disk. File support is insane, too, including: MKV, MP4, AVI, and MOV files in my testing. I've literally started playing almost all of my media off of the hard drive as the television gladly accepts and plays back every major file format flawlessly. It even supports multiple audio streams and, in the case of MKV files, subtitles too.There's a pretty neat feature you can enable here that also allows device control over HDMI, and I honestly wasn't sure what that meant, but after enabling it allowed me to navigate my PS3 dashboard using the TV remote, which is a really nice added bonus (even though I now use the TV for all of my media consumption). I'm not sure what other devices this might work with, but it's a little extra icing on an otherwise delicious cake.--Summary--This is one of the best purchases I've made in terms of home theater. It's the perfect size for my viewing distance and makes organizing and playing back my media better and easier than before. I'll reiterate what I said earlier: at this price point, you likely won't find a better looking television.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture but has a buzz", "Author": "HeWentToJareds", "ReviewID": "R1HXRR45T17J7R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As others have mentioned, this set seems to have a problem with a buzzing sound.I got a set that was a \"buzzer.\" I live on the third floor in a 1 bedroom apartment.

I simply am trying to adequately spell out any and all issues future users might encounter.Pros:Fantastic overall picture.Great black levels, as advertised.3D is great. I don't use it all the time, but when I do, it performs quite admirably. As someone who gets a minor headache from going to 3D movie theaters, I can attest to this TV being very \"safe\" for those kinds of people. Furthermore, 3D is not limited to 3D TV broadcasts or 3D movies; the TV seems to be quite capable of converting my computer's screen to 3D.I fear that I won't be able to adequately explain what I mean by this but the TV has a very \"clean\" interface. Hitting the menu button on the remote brings up a nicely organized and logical interface which is easy to navigate through. The sound accompanying you selecting a new part of the menu isn't quite as annoying as the usual TV's; in fact, I actually rather like it (but I'm quite sure I will grow tired of it in the future.)Comes with a nice TV stand. The stand compliments the TV, adding to the sort of futuristic look created by the glass. In fact, the stand is glass itself. The part of the stand that connects to the TV is plastic, for durability and so that screws can be threaded through it. A nice plus to the stand is that you can rotate the TV about 15 degrees to either side, adding to its versatility.The only button on the TV is a \"joystick\" type thing found on the bottom left side of the TV (when you are facing the screen.) This is, to me at least, an ingenious innovation by Samsung; in a single button, you can turn the TV on/off, change the volume, change the channel, access the menu, change the source of video input to the TV, and access the Samsung \"Smart Hub.\" I believe a description of how this works is not necessary, but I will suffice to say that it is intuitive, requires naught but a single finger to operate, and can essentially replace every function that a remote can do with a single button. Lastly, you can do all of this in the dark, which is much better than having to fumble around for up to 10 buttons found on some TVs.Cons:Auto-brightness is rather terrible, I overrode it and set all of the brightness settings to maximum because of (see next CON)->Highly reflective screen: you can practically use the screen as a mirror in a bright room, especially when a mostly black or grey image or video is being watched. I have the TV in a room where there is a large window, a sliding door, and two doors leading into other parts of the house. As a result, the screen reflects a lot of light, making it tough to view the screen sometimes.I could be wrong and just haven't tested it extensively enough, but when I hook up my laptop to the TV and try to play Battlefield 3, for example, it appears as if the TV lags a bit, which is detrimental to performance when gaming. While movie watching wouldn't be an issue because the lag is \"constant,\" gaming suffers. However, this could be due in part to my 20ft HDMI cable. That being said, I use the same cable for my 30\" Sharp TV which I now use as a monitor, and no such lag occurs.The amount of outputs and inputs on the TV are quite limited. Samsung makes this very clear when listing the ports, and so I guess I was just in denial that such a fantastic TV would have few ports. That being said, the lack of ports has not been an issue except in one way; in terms of audio output, there is but a measly digital audio port. The cheap addition of a 3.5mm jack for headphones would have been an intelligent addition. A stereo output also would have been rather nice. So, if you do decide to purchase this TV, a digital to 3.5mm or digital to stereo adapter would probably be a good idea to buy along with it.As a result of the glass screen, finger prints are easy to leave on the screen. However, those that are on my TV now are only apparent if you look at the TV from an angle, so perhaps it's not a huge issue.As a final point, I'd like to mention the sound. I couldn't bring myself to list this as a con or a pro because it has attributes of both. Mids and Highs sound fine, even great perhaps, but bass really suffers. Because of this, I'd recommend going with a surround sound system, but the TV's audio will still satisfy casual listeners. As an audiophile, I must say that it does not satisfy me.Overall one fantastic TV!!!", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for me, maybe not for you...", "Author": "D.

After receiving the product and hooking it up, I was initially disappointed with the picture quality. It took a little bit of time playing with the picture settings, but once I got it right the images jumped off the screen...and I'm not even talking about the 3D mode!As with most thin televisions, the sound leaves you somewhat unsatisfied. The speakers are fine for everyday TV watching, but too weak for a big budget action film. The small sound is seemingly enhanced by the large and vivid picture. With an image this sharp, clear, and large, you feel immersed in the show/movie, but the sound serves to remind you that you are still in your living room. Fortunately, there are many hook up options on the back panel, so setting up an easy to use surround system will not be difficult at all.I have not done much with the online widgets. I am a confessed Apple nerd and have Apple TV set top boxes hooked to all of the televisions in my home. From the little bit of time I've spend using the Samsung's Smart TV features, they seem adequate. Load time is bette than some of the other built-in wifi units I've used, but apps and widgets do seem to take longer to load than they do on the Apple TV.As far as this TV goes, I find the remote and menus all very easy to use an navigate. The initial set up was easy, and I've experienced no issues with the set. I really haven't had any regrets over purchasing this TV. Watching sports is awesome on this TV. There is no ghosting on the plasma screen, which is something that always bothered me with my LCD TV. After researching several models, I felt that this was the best value currently in the 60-65\" range for my needs. Your needs may be different. The screen has a glossy finish on it, and it will reflect light in the room. It's not a problem for me since the TV is in the basement, but I would have elected for a TV with a matte screen if I was intending to place it in a room with a lot of windows or light sources that can't be controlled. Finally, the more expensive LCD/LED sets tend to be brighter than plasma sets. Quite often this distorts the image, but it is helpful in rooms with a lot of light sources.Another point to consider is what you will be using the TV for. Plasma sets have come a long way since their inception. They used to have many issues with image burn in. This is greatly reduced in current models, but still something I remain aware of. I minimize the amount of static images in my screen, which means I do not surf the web or leave movies and video games paused with the screen on for any length of time. I also adjust the screen when sidebars appear on a program I am watching. If you have a tendency to have/leave static images on the screen, you are better off going with an LED/LCD model.In summary, this is a great television, and it meets all of my needs (large screen, great picture, good value), but you need to think about what you will be using it for and your usage tendencies before you can decide if it would be a good fit for you.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "for a 60\" this one is the best bang for the buck", "Author": "travis smith", "ReviewID": "RW8MWJ27SFTCB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll break down most of the negative reviews, because they almost talked me out of buying this.-Glare? I guess I expected it on a TV (maybe I'm deprived) it does exist on this one, but not in any abnormal amount.-Sound? Its supposed to be small and flat, so... it sounds like any TV. Just buy some nice speakers to match that TV.-Picture? I think this screen looks amazing. I sit about 14' from the TV normally so maybe that's why it looks so good, It sucks from 4' away. So do the movie theaters though. It was just not built for that. The picture is awesome.-Smart hub software? super annoying at first, constantly slow updates and installs, but once you get the two or three things you want on there, it will chill ad you can pretty much ignore it and just flip between TV and netflix or whatever other apps people actually use. you can get everything else from choosing a source on the remote like most TVs......also the glitch where it keeps jumping back to the hub has not occurred on my set.I had to put some holes in my wall to do the low profile mount, because the cords stick right out the back. It was worth it. Overall this TV is excellent. I love it. Two small things that went almost unadvertised; there is a phone app that functions as a full remote control! gravy to set up. Once you add a killer speaker system, you can tell the TV you're using it and it will disable all of it own volume controls effectively preventing the other less informed or lazier users from listening to bad TV sound. Now they're forced to listen to good sound. There's a lot of other perks but those two are great. That TV remote app even has a direction pad and buttons for gamers. Even though I didn't care about 3D, I had to buy a movie and try it. It is crisp, crisper than the theater I think.

There are a myriad of TV's available in this price range but once you start doing your homework and looking at all the features it really came down to either this set or the - Panasonic VIERA TC-P50ST50 50-Inch 1080p 600Hz Full HD 3D Plasma TV. After reviewing both sets in person I did conclude that the Panasonic had a little richer color depth but the Samsung was cheaper and ultimately that was what made my decision. During the 100 hr. break-in period on the Samsung however the blacks have gotten significantly deeper and richer then in the store.It is not a perfect TV as with all plasmas there is significant glare during the day but 90% of my viewing occurs at night and I do have the ability to 'blackout' my room if need be. Regardless the superior color reproduction and clarity makes it a no brainer over LCD/LED there really is no comparison Plasma is simply a far superior product in the right environment. Also the AllShare software which allows you to stream data via WiFi is a bit clunky and regardless of my best efforts I can not get large data files (12 gigs and above) to stream seamlessly but I can always burn a 3d movie if need be.If price versus performance is your main consideration then this is the TV for you - hands down - just be an educated consumer and realize the limitations of Plasma before making the purchase so as not to be disappointed.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good picture and apps, but audio buzz issue", "Author": "Michael C.

Don't get me wrong, it has a GREAT picture, for both 2D and 3D.  The apps are great, and overall it's definitely a good value for the price.  However, there is one serious flaw.  The TV buzzes very noticeably.  I know all plasmas buzz to some degree, but this one is louder than most, or at least does so at a higher frequency that is more noticeable.  The good news is it only happens when you are directly in front of the TV.  This means for some rooms and seating arrangements it's just fine (because you do not hear it at angles).  But if you are using this TV for a media room set up with a good audio system, you probably want to be right in front of the TV.  Even at 15+ feet, the buzz is heard pretty noticeably under low volume or silence in the movie conditions.  So although in almost all aspects, this TV is very good.  This is a pretty fundamental flaw that will drive you nuts once you notice it assuming you use the TV as I describe.

First impressions:On first start-up everything was smooth and simple. The TV set itself up, found my network instantly, did a firmware update, scanned my OTA channels and went right to the antenna afterward. Great pic right off!There is zero buzz! I stuck my head behind the set and can't even hear a hum! Cool!The picture seems brighter, clearer and crisper than our old PN58B650 (and we absolutely loved that set). Don't know if it's because the B650 is old, the E550 is new, or both? But the E550 is definitely better.I don't seem to have an issue with glare at all? Our living room has 2 patio doors and 2 windows and the E550 doesn't look any different than the B650 and the B650 I had what, 2 layers of coating?As much as I bitched about it, the 3D is pretty cool. So far I just turned on People's Court for something standard to look at and the 3D effect was very good. At first I saw a very annoying flicker for a few seconds, but then it just went away and things were good. Watched for a awhile, then flicked around other channels to check it out. All good! Can't wait now to watch a 3D blu-ray!The streaming is awesome. So far I set up our Netflix and Hulu accounts and everything works faster than our Roku's. I was quite surprised to see that the built-in Wi-fi runs at the faster 300Mbps (5 GHz) speed also?For those with older Samsungs too, the learning curve for the new menu's and picks was pretty fast. I only had to search around twice for certain settings. I used my old B650 settings for this and they seem to produce the same picture (as far as brightness, contrast, cell, etc.).Played a little COD/MW3. In 3D was pretty cool, but too dark, I'll have to work on that later? It didn't appear to be in actual 3D, but created a nice effect for making opponents stand out more. Gaming in 2D was normal, so I'm thinking the darkness had to do with the glasses? We do have some 3D games, so I'll have to get to those later also.I now have the 120 break-in slides running and the screen looks totally uniform. No light or dark spots or anything? That was a major thing I was worried about, but all is good!This is all for now. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it stays this way!UPDATE: I just had our second one of these delivered. The first one had a bug where you would be watching and the screen would go black and the sound turn off. The TV was still on and functioning, but you would have to change channels about 10 times and everything would pop back on. Since it had this issue I opted to replace it. No sense in taking chances. Amazon replaced the TV with no problem and the second one is just as gorgeous as the first. And again no buzz! I would love to hear what people call the annoying buzz? I find it hard to believe that I'm the luckiest guy in the world and all the Samsungs I have bought over the years are the only ones produced without the dreaded buzz. LOL3D update (added bonus here folks): As stated too many times to count, I was one of the sufferers of massive migraines when I watched anything 3D, TV or theater. This TV DID NOT bother me at all. I could watch in 3D day and night if I wanted, so this got the best of my curiousity. I did LOTS of research on the web and have discovered the only plausible explanation that anyone can come up with. It's the difference between active and passive 3D glasses. Passive glasses seem to the culprit of the headaches. As soon as people changed to active glasses their headaches went away!

But shipping was free, and it's a good price. I was initially blown away by the picture quality. Pandora on BluRay was fantastic. However the unit has a significant buzzing sound when viewed anywhere from 4 to 12 feet directly on center and level with the set (ideal viewing position). The buzz is not your typical slight hum that any plasma has when up close to the screen. Instead it is a transformer type high pitched variable buzzing noise coming from the top and left side of the panel (not from the back). I have to set the volume to 40 or more to partially drown it out. Even so, in quiet scenes of movies, it ruins the immersion experience. I also have developed a headache from the constant buzzing. If you sit a few feet off to the left or right of the set, the sound is not as obvious, or if you were to elevate the set and look up at it when watching (not optimal) thereby viewing off center. I cannot see how this is acceptable performance for the TV. I will be contacting Samsung and probably returning the item to Amazon for a replacement or refund. Searching the internet, there is a very common complaint with buzzing problems from Samsung plasmas. Too bad the engineers have not managed to determine the root cause in design or manufacturing and minimize it. I hear some people are getting sets with no buzz, so I suppose I'll cross my fingers on the replacement.

The versatility of the display is also a positive: I can watch sports, blu-rays, Netflix, and also play Xbox 360, PS3 (in 3D as well!) or browse the internet and check on my Flickr, among others, all while soaking in the incredible quality of such a value-friendly TV.  The sound from the built-in speakers is also better than I had expected.  They certainly do not replace even an entry-level stereo system.  But they are good for TV speakers.  Simply put, this is the best TV I have ever bought.There are, however, some issues.  There is a buzzing sound that hums at all times when the TV is on.  It is not particularly loud, but to some it could be irritating enough that returning the TV would not be unreasonable.  The sound is most audible when sitting directly in front of, or perpendicular to, the center of the television.  I solved this issue in my living room by moving the TV a few feet away from the wall behind it and angling the TV slightly off-center so that the center of the TV is really facing the side seat of the couch.  In a smaller space (I usually watch from about 8-10 feet away from the TV) the slightly off-center look is not noticeable at all due to the fact that the TV is really quite enormous especially when viewed from so close.  There is also the issue of glare, being as it is a plasma, but with proper blinds or curtains, the glare is essentially not noticeable even during the day.  My final gripe with the TV is the remote which can be unresponsive at times.  Sometimes I have to open the battery hatch and push the batteries back into their respective compartments.  This is an issue when, say, browsing Netflix.  I have circumvented this by first browsing on my PC what I would like to see, then adding it to the top of my instant queue.I give it five stars because of the great value - huge 3-D display of excellent quality with two very comfortable and very chic 3-D glasses (well, chic insofar as 3-D spectacles are concerned).  If this were any more expensive, I would have given it a 4.5 or so because of the buzzing hum and the less than stellar remote.  But at just under $1550 with free-shipping, this is an extraordinary value and I advise you to seriously consider this stellar Samsung if you have already been thinking about purchasing a television of exceptional display quality to last into the new decade.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture, great features", "Author": "Jeremy N.

Is it perfect?  No?  Are there better TVs?  Of course.  However, this TV is not only a great performer overall, it is also a great value.  The bundle with the free 3D Blu-Ray player and other promotional deductions early last month, made this an even better value.  Yes, there is glare... that's no surprise.  Yes, it doesn't pump out the brightness like an LCD.  However, if you like accurate colors, awesome off-angle viewing characteristics, deep blacks, adequate 3D, and plenty of configurations/settings, this will work fine for you.  Sound?  Not great, but how can you ask for TVs to get thinner and thinner and still pump out the bass; a bit unreasonable IMO.I was quite impressed with its ability to play pretty much everything I threw at it via USB... including full 1080p content.  Image retention/burn-in is not evident, but I don't max out any of the settings, use Vivid mode or view anything with static content for hours on end.  I recommend using Movie mode and turning off all enhancements as a starting point (even dial down sharpness to 0).  The Warm 2 color setting seems best.  Make sure you use screen fit when supplying HD signals... no point in having the TV \"overscan\" what was intended.The Samsung Apps are a bit clunky compared to other platforms (iOS, Android), but I was able to get Netflix, HBO Go, and Amazon Prime to work without issue.  Image definition and quality over HBO Go and Amazon Prime are exceptional to the extent that I'm positive that HBO image quality over HBO Go is superior to what I get tuning directly to the HBO HD channels on my FIOS STB.I haven't encountered anything resembling hum unless I press my ear right to the back of the TV.  The hard drive of my STB is significantly louder and I never consider that a problem.  Use the power line filters included and I'd hope you'd encounter the same silence.3D was also a surprise.  Better than the one movie theater experience I had a couple of years ago.  However, I don't have anything else to compare it to so consider my take on that with a grain of salt.As for the delivery process: it went as smooth as could be expected.  Two guys carried it up a flight up steps, un-boxed it, and powered it on to see if it would work.

I mounted this TV above a fireplace in a room with very large picture windows. It is true that if you focus on the reflections on the Screen and not whatever you are watching you will pick up the view to the rear of you. In reality I find my eyes are focusing on the picture coming from the TV not the reflection. So yes when the TV is off there is a solid reflection so if that will be a problem get the next model up with a low gloss screen. Now getting on to what I think counts. The HD picture is Amazing and 3D is very true to life. The smart features have limitations that this TV seems to shares with all TVs. The sound is surprising good considering how thin the speakers must be. The shipping from Amazon was on target and very professional. The only reason for the half a star deduction is because of the glossy screen. How much more does it cost to put in low reflection glass? The blue tooth 3D glasses seem a little cheap but work flawlessly. I was considering purchasing this TV or the comparable Panasonic and chose this one only because of price. The Panasonic has a better picture but the Samsung has better sound, is less expensive and includes two pair of 3D glasses. The Panasonic did not include any glasses.

I bought as a reward for becoming full time computer support. I spent about $2300. Problem was it started having issues in 2013 with a dim and flickering corner of the screen. It was a great tv. To repair it I was going to have to spend about $1300, so I opted to just buy a new tv. I was going to get a LED tv, but I discovered I could get a plasma and get the same kind of quality as my led tv. The plasma came in yesterday. I put in through it's paces and tried playstation game play, 3d playstation game play, 3d blu-ray, sd dvd playback, low quality sd playback, and directv playback. Results, amazing. Not only is this tv 5\" bigger which is great, but the picture quality is better than the LED. I had to recalibrate it since it was a little dark out of the box. Everything is sharper. Blacks are darker. Colors more vibrant. White is brighter and true white. The led did have a slight blue tint, but when it was calibrated it was next to nothing with only really rare whites showing the tint. The 3d on the tv is better. The active glasses have less noticable flicker, but my led glasses was 99% unnoticable unless I was looking for it. The 3d on the plasma is smoother in playback as well as having a brighter image which wearing glasses. The led was a lot more dark and usually I had to nudge the brightness a bit on the tv or in the game settings. Motion on this tv so far has been flicker free. My led couldn't say that. Even with mpeg noise filter off about 8% of high motion scenes had minor blurring or a flicker (blinds mainly). So all in all when it comes to video and 3d this beat my $2300 led tv from back in 2010!Now the led to first plasma tv concerns.1. Burn in. None yet, knock on wood. First thing I did was activate the burn in protection features as well as adjusted them to run sooner. I am going to break in the tv by avoiding static images or movie bars for the next month. I did have this during testing, but I limited those sessions to about 20 minutes to test. So far none. I even watch the news for 30 minutes and switched channels with no signs of image retention. Samsung during tests are a little less prone to image retention than panasonic. Still happens. I'm going to be careful and watch new in short bursts, game sessions for only a few hours, and no pausing or leaving menus up for too long.2. Hum. Virtually none. If you put your ear up to the tv at about 8\" you will hear an old crt kind of screen hum. Any further away in a completely silent house you can't hear it. I'm an audiophile and huge movie and game nut. Trust me, no really hum to worry about.3. Glare. When the tv is off it has a lot of glare. We have two lamps. One at about 25 degrees and one at about 140 degrees. You can see them if lit and watching tv. However, the led did this too and I had a matte screen. The reflections while watching a video playing is only about 15% more noticeable. As for the blinds on the glass door at about 160 degrees those have to remain shut. Not really an issue since they are adjustable and I can angle them to hide the light and still have the sliding glass door open during attic fan use.All in all I say hum is a none issue. The glare is more noticeable, but the led had it too and you have to remember your going to a glass front. Unless you have to have multiple lights on in the room, the glare can be managed. As for the image burn that is the only thing scary about having this tv. I'll just be smart. I will break it in for the first month so it is a little more resistant. I've also warned the fam about burn in as well as they have to pay for a new tv if they cause it. :)Since I was burned on a $2300 after 2 years I can't really endorse Samsung fully. They still make great tvs. I almost went panasonic, but again best buy proved this Samsung was the right tv for me at under $1300. I could have spent more and got a led, but so far I am loving this plasma and I may be sold on plasma for quite a long time. If you buy a Samsung make sure to factor in a warranty as well.

Crisp, clear, bright picture and the colors are very vibrant. I bought this TV to upgrade my five year old 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma. I was concerned about this TV having a glossy screen as a number of reviewers stated that it was too reflective. In my opinion there are both benefits and caveats with high gloss screens. On the plus side the picture is considerably sharper and on the minus you can get annoying reflections if your room has a lot of windows or lights that can reflect off the TV. For me this is a non issue as my TV is in a room where lights and windows that reflect are at a minimum. If you have a room where this is a factor... don't buy this TV and then give it a bad review because you didn't do your research up front. If you're like me and it's not... then you'll appreciate the extra clarity you get with a glossy screen.Ok so a few details and observations...Picture is great! Very crisp and clear, colors are vibrant and saturated without being overly unrealistic.3D works really well. Whether you're sitting in the middle or viewing off axis the effect is not degraded. The 3D effect leans more towards depth than popping out at you. You get the feeling like you're looking out of a window at a 3D world.The glasses work well, syncing is easy enough and they're comfortable enough to easily watch a full length movie. I wear glasses and they fit fine over them.Smart TV, The smart TV and apps work well. The TV easily found and connected to my WiFi with a strong signal. As expected the TV will have to download and update it's firmware first time around and it does take a while to get things setup. Once setup however... apps run smoothly and load time for apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime is much faster than on my Xbox 360. Speaking of Amazon Prime... I'm quickly falling in love with this service, it gives me everything Netflix has to offer plus unlike Netflix... I get free two day shipping on Amazon for less money. This TV is one of the only ones that offer Amazon Prime so if you're a fan like me... look no further.Web browser... A lot of people complain about how slow and tedious using the built in web browser is. All I can say is... It's a TV. What do you expect? If you really want good web browsing performance... hook a PC up to it and quit whining. ;)With that said... This TV is a great deal for the money!

Thought I'd researched carefully, but I guess it wasn't enough. First the good - TV has a great picture, great 3D, and is very light for a plasma. The Samsung Allshare access is amazing. I was going to run an HDMI cable from my office to this unit to watch my downloaded video's. But Allshare streams this stuff really nicely, supports just about every file format I've tried, and has a great interface. I won't be streaming to my xbox anymore, and won't need to directly connect my PC.The bad - well the huge irritation that is making me consider returning this unit is this 'Smart TV's' so called smart hub. I've got it hooked up to a new 2012 high end Yamaha receiver via HDMI with ARC. While in the SmartHub if you run an app, such as Pandora, and then exit back to the SmartHub, the HDMI input suddenly changes and you get no ARC audio return. So, you have to find the receiver's remote, and manually switch back to the proper port to hear any sound. I've tried every setting to prevent this. Googling shows this is an issue with Samsung Smart TV's dating back almost two years.Next, is all audio produced by SmartHub apps, such as Netflix, etc. only comes down through HDMI ARC in two channel stereo. Even their 3d demonstration clips are converted to stereo. On my new Samsung Blueray player that came with the TV, its same SmartHub apps have none of these problems. Netflix, etc are sampled properly and not converted down to stereo. Again, Google this issue, and it has been there for years. I guess for the time being, I'll be accessing everything from my Blueray's SmartHub.The fix for these issue is to turn off ARC and use an optical toslink cable from the TV to the receiver. Which means I'll have to unmount the TV from the wall and go through a major hassle. This is all new state of the art 2012 equipment. I shouldn't have to juryrig it like this. I should have saved $300 bucks and bought the non-Smart version of this TV.Any advice is welcomed,Stephen", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Deal", "Author": "Pete", "ReviewID": "R13SQDF0HDP95M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have had this TV for about a month and am enjoying it greatly.

I had scheduled the delivery w/ Pilot for their latest appointment available, which was 3-6pm. On the day of delivery, the TV arrived at 8AM so I didn't have to miss work. The delivery guy was courteous. He unpackaged and tested the product as was required. I'm very satisfied with Amazon and Pilot's delivery service.Right off the bat, I was wary of the dreaded \"buzz\". It's been 20 days, and after close to 200 hrs of usage, I'm happy to report there is no annoying buzz. If I stand directly in front of the TV and close to the center, I hear a soft hum, but as soon as I take one step backwards, I don't hear it anymore. CNET recently said the Samsung plasma's have the best burn-in protection, another thing to be very happy about!Picture quality is amazing with the regular factory settings. Used the Disney WOW DVD to calibrate, and I was blown away even more with the quality of the deep blacks and color. The 3-D glasses that came with the TV seem to work great.  I watched Alice in Wonderland in 3D, and didn't notice any ghosting. I am a little disappointed with the lack of anti-reflection on the screen. Most of our viewing is done at night anyway, so it's not a huge deal, but it does get a little annoying sometimes.Having the Smart Hub apps was something I was really looking forward to. Amazon does not state that apps on E550 are limited compared to those available on the 6500 and higher. This meant no HBO Go for me. I tried accessing HBO Go through the built-in web browser, but I would need Silverlight to view any of the videos and that is something that cannot be done on this TV. I get plenty of use from the Hulu and Netflix apps, and even Vudu. Samsung seems to be adding new ones along the way, so I'm satisfied with that so far. If Samsung adds Amazon Instant Video to their line-up, I would change my 4 stars to 5.The web browser initially felt very clunky. If you want to use the remote control for browsing, forget it! I downloaded the Samsung Remote App on my phone, and what a lifesaver that was! I would highly recommend doing that rather than buying a separate universal remote, assuming you already have a smartphone.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my new Sammy, with price and quality. However, if you can afford the 6500, I would recommend doing so.***Update 10/24/12Absolutely loving this tv.

Sound about right?!Took possession of the TV on Monday, set it up, turned it on, and was blown away by the beautiful picture (Consumer Reports did recommend the thing after all).  Putting it together and working through the initial menus was a breeze.  Then sat down on the couch dead smack in front of it ~12ft away and \"buzzzzzzzzz\".  If I leaned my head a little to the left or right, the buzz would fade away dramatically.  I was confident it shouldn't be from the speakers since the volume was set to \"0\" (I prefer to use my tried-and-true Sony surround sound system).  Tried the other inputs - the same issue.  TV volume up and surround sound off - the same issue.  ...you see where I am going with this.I immediately called Samsung to see what we could do (same night as the TV was delivered and set up, btw), they asked me if I tried X, Y, & Z (I had) and so they said \"since the TV is still under warranty (no kidding), we could set up a service call\".  I asked them to hold that thought and called Amazon to confirm they would still take a return after a service call if it didn't fix the problem.  They graciously agreed and so I called Samsung back.  New guy on the phone insisted I needed to do even more trouble shooting steps.  Done - the same issue.  Ok, now we can set up the service call. Yeay!Two days later, I still hadn't received a call to set up service appointment so I called Samsung back to find out what's up.  New, new guy informed me buzzing was normal for a plasma.  I informed him \"No, it's not normal to feel like my head is jammed inside a hornets nest while the TV is on mute.  Now please just tell me what's up with my repair order.\"  Long story short, the order had not been placed. New, new repair order and this time I got a phone number.  Hung up, called the number and...\"beep, beep, beep...the number you have called has been disconnected, is no longer...\".  Called Samsung back.  Verified the number with the new, new, new girl and discover that two of the digits had been passed to me transposed.  Called the new, new number, confirmed the new, new order number.  They come by tomorrow.My current plan is either they can fix it on the spot...or it goes back to Amazon.  I'll update this review after tomorrow.Oh yeah, the 3D on the thing is great too.  Only issue noticed was when watching Transformers III, whenever the motion in the movie picked up, things would get a bit blurry until they slowed back down again.  I figure it is probably related to the quality of the 2 active 3D glasses included in the package deal but can't say for sure without trying different ones.  I also determined that the built in speakers on the TV aren't really that good.  This would be expected though considering how small they are.  Besides, if you are going to put money into buying a loaded 3D Smart TV for the \"ultimate viewing experience\", you probably should be giving some thought into getting a decent sound system to plug it into.Update (15Jan12)My family and I live in a twin-city type area with a population approaching half a million people.  So you can imagine my surprise when I discovered that the nearest Samsung-authorized warranty repair was almost an hour away.  They do come to your house but there's a catch: they don't bring repair parts and if they can't fix it on the spot, they take the device and return it a week later (they only head to our cities only once a week).  Needless to say, this wasn't exactly an acceptable policy for us so we cancelled the repair and opted to work an exchange through Amazon instead.Where Samsung customer service is abysmal, Amazon's shines!  The TVs were out of stock so they arranged to call me when they were back in...which they did!  On vacation during that period...no problem!  They just called later.  The local delivery company brought the new TV, helped me set it up, and then repackaged up the old one and took it away.  The bad part...buzzzzzzzzz...  Yup, the replacement buzzed just like the first.Here's what I believe.  First off, there's likely merit to comments made in some of the other reviews; \"Probably most if not all of these Samsung plasmas buzz and it's just that some people don't hear it\".  I suspect this may be part related to people's hearing and part related to TV placement.  Since the sound is most distinct almost straight on facing the screen, perhaps if the TV is wall mounted high enough, it isn't as obvious.Ultimately, my wife and I decided on Sharp Aquos Quatron (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076LY26Y/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc;=1&smid;=A1WZB4FLR6WTPV) after doing a bunch more research.

In general, this TV has much more vibrant colors and a noticeably better response time (I.E., plasmas have a much better refresh rate - you don't need to turn on any of that 120Hz/240Hz motion stuff that LCD/LEDs use which looks terrible; no \"soap opera effect\").  The downsides is that the glass is very reflective which makes daytime viewing troublesome and the buzzing is noticeable at times.Pros:* Amazing colors* Response time - great for action scenes.Cons:* Screen glare -The surface reflects like mirror if any lights are on in the room or if you have any windows.* Buzz - As others have mentioned there is a buzz if sitting directly in front of the TV.  But disappears if you move to one side (> 30 degrees) or below the TV.  The buzz is fairly quiet though.  If the room is quiet and if you know what to listen for then you will notice it.

I've looked at various in depth reviews and breakdowns of a variety of TV's, from LED to Plasma from several different credible online resources to actually going in store and looking at some of my friends and families TV's. This being my first large flat screen HDTV I did my homework!!!The more I learned, the more I realized I wanted to go with a smart tv, not so much for their capabilities right now, but with the ability to update software and firmware, I should be able to stay up to date for quite some time. Secondly, I wasn't a 3D supporter to say the least and so I was not set out to buy a 3D TV. I have a very large family room that this TV lives in, about 900 sq ft, with wood floors and white walls, 4 windows and 2 doors. Therefore, one of my big concerns with getting a plasma was the glare factor. I also wasn't going to spend an arm and a leg for a TV!As I did my research I originally set out to get an LED for all the reasons we have all heard. Better life expectancy/No Glare/ New Technology, etc. Even when taking all of that into consideration I realized the best value for my needs was to find a 2012 model Plasma that offered me what I wanted in an affordable price range.I settled on the E550 because of the outstanding reviews that people had given on a variety of websites, not just Amazon. So when I finally set out to get my TV during Super Bowl Week I knew what I was after.I must say, I truly enjoy this TV. and I am extremely pleased with my purchase so far. This was a large investment for me and I don't take it lightly. The picture has been great, and after upgrading to Directv with the Genie receiver it makes my viewing experience that much better. I like the Smart features of the TV, however I haven't fully conquered it all yet, I am impressed by it's capabilities. I updated to the latest firmware version upon start up, which makes me feel secure that my TV. is staying up to date with the latest technology. We enjoy having Netflix, Pandora, Hulu Plus, and I like some of the sports apps that are available.I stated above that I was not looking for a 3D TV, I purchased this TV. not because of the 3D factor but because of all the other features. I have to admit however, the 3D on this TV has definitely impressed me and my wife! We have now watched 2 full basketball games in 3D and it is crazy cool. I am NOT crazy about the glasses that come with the TV. I have a large head and the glasses are meant for smaller heads. The frames are too flexible and it is hard to keep them on straight. With that said though, we will be purchasing some 3D movies to go with our free 3D bluRay player that came with the TV.One of my biggest concerns going in with the plasma's was the glare issues I've read about. Like I said before, we have an very large family room, that is very bright during the day. My original intentions were to buy this tv. from Best Buy knowing that I could return it within 30 days for a full refund. However, Best Buy had 0 of the E550's in stock! Online, and in store! So, I did the next best thing, Amazon. After it arrived and we got it set up I was a little nervous. When the TV is off, it definitely looks like a mirror. However, we have found that the glare issue isn't as bad as we thought it would be. While yes there is a glare, especially when the lights or lamps are on, the TV gets bright enough that it counter balances for the glare. I have noticed the glare of the ceiling lights during some dark scenes in the evening time, but during the day we have had on noticeable problem with glare issues. I recognize that some people might be more critical of this than me, but it is no worse than our old 60\" projection TV. We don't notice any difference.To sum it up, I am very happy and pleased with my purchase! Can you find better TV's, yes I'm sure you can. However, for the size, and the capabilities you are granted with this TV, I don't know that you will  find a better value anywhere out there, believe me I looked. If you are looking for a TV with similar interests as I was, then I wouldn't hesitate purchasing this TV.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great price for an excellent t.v.", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R19OJIRAMTTKAE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading many reviews about this product I was worried about the reflective mirror like screen that everyone was talking about but it really isn't that bad unless you have a lamp right in front of it and concentrate on the reflection.

The picture quality is great, the sound is great, the 3d is freaking awesome.  The sound is great.  I have know issues with this box, no humming (but I did use the torriod cores provided).  I can't recommend this TV enough.  There are only 2 things I would change,1. Amazon/Samsung, work it out and get an AMazon VOD on there.  Quit pointing fingers at one another and worry more about making your CUSTOMERS happy, we are the one that give you money after all.2. The timeout for the DNLA setting on Samsung devices is too short.  This means if you use programs like playon.tv to watch content from the internet, the tv will find the shares and show your content, but will not play it.  This is because of the prep in the background by the program (playon in this case) takes to long and the tv kills the connection.  Samsung could address this in a firmware update very easily.Besides those 2 gripes though, I really love this TV, it has tons of functionality and potential, the the picture quality is beautiful.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awsome TV!", "Author": "Fontaine", "ReviewID": "RWQ5RDOOQITKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great job Samsung!

I was avoiding buying plasma because of the energy consumption differences.  However the comparison on consumption cost between this set and a similarly sized LCD/LED was only 3 dollars so I decided to go for it.PROSThe picture quality is fantastic. Really great blacks, sharp color, great image. The DVD's of Lord of the Rings look unbelievably good on it. Better then the theater.The 2d-3d mode is surprisingly good. We have used it while playing Smash Brothers on WII and it does a decent job.The app selection is great. Its a little slow to update the apps, but being able to watch netflix directly through it was a win.  No Amazon video app yet though.ConsWeight - OK this sucker is heavy, especially compared to LCD/LED's. If you are wall mounting get help. You will need it.Heat - While not as bad as some of the older plasma's this set does throw off some heat.Ports - 3 HDMI. Really? I mean I am already max'd out going into this set, and will probably need a switch box at some point in the future.  Why is Samsung so frugal with their HDMI ports.Sound is just ok.  Not blow you away quality but decent.  This is a set which begs for a good sound system to go along with it.Overall I would happily recommend this TV to anyone who asked.

Who with an hd tv uses anything other than hdmi to input a signal from sat box, ps3, blu ray ect to connect to tv.  When they made this expensive 3D HD tv they assumed that no one pays for cable or uses any other hd devices to connect to this tv. Why waste money and time having hdmi ins and a digital audio(optical) out if there is no digital sound out put from any of these sources.I contacted Samsung because some how I got lucking and got it my Ps3 to pass thru but not sat box. This makes me believe it could be fixed with firmware but they say other wise. I read a thread someone posted about their experience with customer service and they basically told the guy to replace his one year old tv.  They rep advised me to reset setting as a fix and now I can't get the ps3 back to Dolby 5.1 either.  They then escalated my case and I was supposed to receive a call back at a specified time and never was contacted.

It was very easy to setup and required no adjustments. I do believe the PN51E550 is not temperamental. The SmartTV feature works very well with my wireless DSL.  The set is essentially a computer and the picture is beautiful.  I like it much more than the LCD in the same price range The LCD produced crummy black. I've read that a few other plasma brands produce truer black than the PN51E550, but I'd have to see the sets side-by-side to believe it. I got this set because I like movies, and \"they\" say plasma is the set to get for home theatre.Image RententionPlasma requires keeping the screen filled with action and can be a pain in the rear. The potential for image retention is real and must be on the operator's mind. The picture needs to fill the screen, and the set requires vigilance to prevent burn in. On page ONE, the Samsung PN51E550 manual states that the set must be operated with a dynamic picture over the entire screen 95% of the time. If the picture has bars on the side because the program does not fit the entire screen, then image retention (burn in) becomes an issue.  The manufacturer goes on to say that static-image damage begins after 20 minutes.  The viewer can usually adjust the picture ratio to eliminate side bars, but not always top and bottom bars, present in some HD movies. So even a careful user can easily damage the plasma screen. I knew that burn-in would be a challenge.Netflix ProgrammingSome programs on Netflix are a problem, especially the old TV shows formatted to 4:3; the screen ratios cannot be adjusted once the set is tuned into Netflix. Last night I tried to watch an old TV show on Netflix (1989) and 10 minutes into the show the picture ratio changed from 16:9 to 4:3. I had to stop watching. The picture ratio could not be adjusted to fill the screen and prevent image retention. This is not a fun situation. Netflix ratios are not changeable. (Shame on Netflix! or is it shame on Samsung? My reading suggests that this problem doesn't have to exist.)Surfing Direct TV and Adjusting Dynamic Picture RatiosSurfing the channels on Direct TV for plasma friendly content can be a little frustrating, although there is a significant amount of HD programming, so I don't want to overstate this problem. Press the Guide button twice on the DirectTV remote to get a list of all their HD stations. My primary source is Direct TV, and users often need to adjust the PN51E550 picture aspect ratios when they land on a non-HD channel.[Note: the TV is 16 units wide and 9 units high, which creates an aspect ration of 16:9, which is the modern standard for broadcast.]Just How Tricky is This?The fear of accidental image retention limits my viewing pleasure. As for my infirm 88 year old house guest, forget it. One day she will fall asleep and burn the screen. If you have kids, tell them to keep the gate closed so the dog doesn't get out. I am resigned to my fate, are you resigned to losing your dog? The Samsung plasma PN51E550 really is a home theater product because the picture is so sharp. It is not for gaming or surfing the Internet or reading your e-mail. You can watch YouTube and a bunch of offerings with apps from Samsung.Three-D (3D) is ready to go, and there it is on your Samsung. It's okay. You might watch one movie in 3D or catch a football game, maybe.Summary on Screen AdjustmentUsually, in most viewing situations the picture can be stretched or zoomed to fill the screen. [Fit Screen, Set as 16:9, or Stretch Screen; or Zoom 1 or Zoom 2] If Netflix presents the film in any aspect ration other than 16:9, the screen will not be filled and there is nothing that can be done (at least not at this time). There's lot of programming in 16:9 ratio on Satellite and on Netflix--so I don't want to go overboard with this criticism.You are not wasting your money when you buy this TV.When She's Good, She's Very Very GoodThe network channels that broadcast in true HD with a 16:9 dynamic aspect ration and that air recent shows such as 30 Rock, etc., are beautiful. Netflix movies in HD 16:9 ration and NatGeo specials in HD 16:9 ratio are beautiful. In many ways I love the PN51E550, the WiFi, the controls, the picture, the deep blacks, the beautiful colors, and the fine detail. I doubt that you can beat the plasma picture quality.

Nevertheless, the picture on the set is absolutely gorgeous!  The Wifi setup was a cinch.  I absolutely love the Smarthub! There is a bit of a glare on the screen with the lights on in my bedroom, however, because it is wall-mounted it is located about 8ft directly in front of the ceiling fixture.  The light is on a dimmer though so I just turn it down and no more glare!  The best thing about ordering from Amazon was the free delivery through Amazon Prime! You cannot beat that as you save at least $100 dollars on this set and you don't have to borrow your best friend's SUV to get it home from the store.  The delivery company that Amazon hired was AMAZING!  I scheduled my delivery for after 4pm, when I arrived home at 330pm, they were there patiently waiting for me! Gotta love that!  As well, they didn't just drop it at the door they took it all the way to the 3rd floor room where it was to be installed!  Fabulous!  You cannot go wrong with ordering a big screen from Amazon and I have to say I was very leery at first, but they made me a believer.  I had been researching this set for several weeks and kept eyeballing the price on various websites, but realized that Amazon's price was very competitive especially with the free delivery.  You will love this tv and the web-browsing is so much fun!  Enjoy!

I include this point in my review of the tv (even though it is majority blame to hollywood 90% and not the tv set 8% or the viewer's eyes 2%)because #1 the tv advertisers in every ad advertise out of your screen 3d and #2 because the out of your screen option is not available (and the 3d perception option is not the same and the image gets blurrier if you use this)to viewers and #3 the manufacturer should include how much out of screen ability the tv even has!!!!!We want out of the screen 3d!! Nobody, nobody advertises depth when advertising 3d tv's and nobody advertises saying 3d out of your screen is gimmicky and the people do not want it, so stop advertising out of the screen if the manufacturer will not even concede to putting the varying abilities your tv has for out of screen images.Now, quickly for those who will respond to this not being the tv's fault. Please, read again how I already know 92% is not the tv's fault and then read again what I wrote to support this.If you advertisers like Samsung advertise out of your screen 3d then give us a demo showcasing the out of screen 3d you advertise so we can see it if it is to be 100% blame on hollywood.This is why manufacturers are also to blame.  It is not all to blame on Hollywood because LCD's do not show as good of out of the screen as this tv does as a plasma.  So if different tv's themselves can produce better or different out of screen images on the same movie then this proves that there is something that can be measured to tell the buyer what they can expect for out of screen specifications.So this tv manufacturer and others and hollywood need to both either quit advertising out of your screen 3d and only advertise depth or get to showing specifications for it so that the buyer knows what to compare with other products. This would alleviate the rest of those who want out of your screen 3d from getting caught with the 3d crowd that is so excited about depth and call out of the screen gimicky when nobody advertises great depth.Now, this tv compared to everthing except the LG is great at 3d. I am not contradicting. I spent many times at blockbuster comparing. This tv has absolutely great depth and compared to any high end 3d tv in the market is just as good if not better.  This tv will match it and beat it. THIS TV (depending on what movie you watch) DOES PROVIDE 3D OUT OF YOUR SCREEN as good if not better than most 3d I've seen on tv's, but the 3d out of your screen will most likely not be what you or others that visit your house expect. The 3d out of your screen will grant more of the response of \"oh, I think it came out the screen,\" or \"I'm not noticing anything come at me.\" This will force you to pause images on your screen to have to point out that your 3d does work, it just is not impressive; but compared to other tv's it is competitive with what they are doing.The best out of your screen I have seen so far is Imax Under the Sea dvd with the shot of the cod fish.  The best depth 3d is Coraline.Now below is the rest of the review on other things about the tv.You will notice things that your LCD did not show (I used to have a toshiba 46xv54ou) and that was a damn good tv. This tv is definitely worth buying and is very competitive in every way to higher costing 3d tv's. I have checked and researched and I am very well aware of ocular or depth perception and angles, distance form tv should be 2x or 3x the width of the tv, images that make your eye move closer for out of screen images and hollywood's stake to play.)Now, for the critical parts.  You do not have the option to cut cinema smooth on during regular programming. Only during dvd movies can you cut the cinema smooth on.  With the exception of perspective 3d and top to bottom 3d (which nobody uses) you will not have the option to change 3d settings when looking at dvd movies or playing games. There is no humming in my tv that other reviewers mention and the glare does not disrupt the images on the tv (but if you want to notice it-it is there, unless in the dark).  I had to go through absolute hell to connect my external speakers to the tv because this tv does not have analog out. No analog out!! You are almost forced to buy a soundbar.I can't give this tv a rating under 4stars because I have seen worse out of the screen tv on other 3d tv's and other than this factor and the no audio log out or cinema smooth or more 3d options the tv really, really, really, is a Good tv.

I am using the Samsung BD-D5500 3D Blu-ray Disc Player (Black) [2011 MODEL] with HDMI and the picture quality is fantastic. I am also using a PC connected via HDMI for web browsing and Netflix. This TV does definitely bring out the quality difference between DVD and blu-ray so if you have not already begun to, expect to begin replacing/updating your collection soon after.Regarding the 'buzz' reported by some: There is a noticeable buzz if you get close enough and make an effort to listen out for it. However it is not distracting from the day-to-day enjoyment of the TV even with the volume extra low in the early hours watching cartoons with my son.Regarding the glare: This TV is very reflective of all light sources nearby. If you don't have lighting control or otherwise use this TV in a dark room I could see that this may be problematic. We currently use this TV on our most shaded wall (windows are all on the same wall or to the side) and have blackout curtains for when the sun is shining in.Regarding sound: I was worried about the small (10 watt) speakers in this TV. We don't have a full HT system hooked at this time since we are only living at our current home for a few more months before relocating. The sound is perfectly reasonable considering though it does seem I get a much higher volume, for less, from my PC via HDMI than my blu-ray player.This TV is altogether a fantastic purchase and I am very pleased with it.===========================The initial incident:Just purchased this TV May 19th and received May 24th. After seeing it was being shipped by Pilot and reading so many concerns regarding their delivery service I was dreading the worst. Pilot air-shipped to a local facility where a local delivery service took over and to their credit it was fantastic service. The delivery agents weren't able to specify a delivery window time but they gave a reasonable pre-delivery call of 1 hour so I could get home to receive (they even waited for me when he showed up 10 minutes early).That evening after hooking up the TV, much to my disappointment, powering it on resulted in a very loud buzz/crackle. I cannot imagine this was any normal plasma buzz as it was audible through the entire room at any distance and sounded like a small Tesla coil.After contacting Samsung (more hopeful than realistically) they were unable to assist and offered a service tech to be dispatched. I declined, called Amazon, who provided very pleasant service despite and made immediate arrangements for my replacement to show up in a week.Non-functional review:The TV is gorgeous. There is little else that can be said. It is extremely high gloss but the wall it is mounted on is opposite of any windows and direct light so it shouldn't be a problem in my case. I am brand-oriented, so the remote immediately picked up to my other Samsung HT devices and with my previous remote interoperability.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "I have three Samsung TV's..all good!

You should buy it.Aside from some rather minor inconveniences this tv is an excellent buy.  Blacks are deep and colors are rich.  You can see every blemish on every actress/actor's face and it does a good job keeping up with quick motion ie sports/action scenes.  My living room is fairly bright in the day but with little to know direct sunlight.  Even with these conditions, I have not noticed any issues with brightness.  It is glass though so, there is potential for glare if you had bright lights or sun directly on it.  No odd humming sounds or glitches to report and it looks phenomenal occupying my living room.I previously made a review on this tv before I got a chance to view it (screen arrived cracked) which was about the base.  The base is perfect for the 51\" model I purchased for a friend but on the rather skimpy side for the 60\" model.  I felt like it could easily be toppled.

FAVI Entertainment Wireless Keyboard (Built-in TouchPad/Laser Pointer) - BlackThis is inconvenient because you are stuck scrolling through the alphabet with the remote.  The prediction power of the apps in the smart hub somewhat makes up for this by guessing options quickly and accurately.  The 'enter/ok/select' button is in the middle of the arrow keys you use for selection so sometimes it will hit ok and you have to backspace by scrolling all the way to the bottom, obnoxious.  But, the apps are developed by their respective companies so this is NOT a failing on samsung's part but rather the app developers.I also dislike the way the tv communicates with my samsung HTIB everytime you turn it on again you have to choose once more which component you will be viewing from as it defaults to the \"optical in\" so... if you have your cable tv piped through HDMI1 and you turn it off it wont default to HDMI1 on start up who knows why but hopefully a firmware update will come along and address this.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "no analog audio out", "Author": "betzw", "ReviewID": "R12I5NOJXI6UNO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Everything about this is just great, EXCEPT there is no analog audio out, and so I cannot use it with remote speakers.
