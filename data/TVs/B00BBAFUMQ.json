{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exactly what we were looking for", "Author": "Rick Blaine", "ReviewID": "R1F1TYYTD1V48U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our box TV died, so we finally entered the flat screen market.  (Our kid's neighborhood friends can stop laughing now every time they come over.) Buying on a budget, we were looking for a 47\"-55\" television for around $500.00, though we were willing to spend up to $750.00.  After a day of research and shopping we settled on this TV, and we are very happy with the choice.  We paid $429.00 for the set and the picture quality is great, the television is sleek and elegant, and the stand swivels and blends in with the set just fine.  It's a perfect fit for our modestly sized family room.At first I was concerned about the 720p resolution, but after reading reviews we were assured that picture would be fine and compared to other televisions the difference would  be indistinguishable unless you were two or three feet away from the screen looking at text.  Sure enough, we have the set and the picture quality is excellent.  I prefer the plasma sets over the LED models.  To me the picture is more vibrant with the plasmas, and that is definitely the case with this LG model.This set is bare bones.  Only two HDMI ports and one USB.  But that's not a problem for us.  We are able to hook our pc to the TV and that provides most of the features that a SMART TV would provide.  (SMART TV?  Has there ever been a more funny oxymoron?) I do not find the bare bones aspect of the television to be a problem since we are minimalists.  In fact, I like how easy this television is to figure out.  The remote is very intuitive and so is the operation of its different modes.  We wanted a television that offered a big screen with outstanding picture quality for the best price possible.  I believe we found that with the LG 50PN4500.  It doesn't make coffee, it can't iron our clothes, and it won't take the angst out of my teenage daughter's life, but it does make television viewing a genuine pleasure.Our family watched Les Miserables last night, and the sound quality was very good and the picture was outstanding.  A wonderful viewing experience for the four of us.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a great TV", "Author": "Lee", "ReviewID": "R2DPHSQBHULW8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one of these TVs then bought 2 more because I liked the first one so much.  I have been waiting for the quality and price to get into my price range and this TV meets both expectations.The color and picture are great.  Only plasma TVs come with 600Hz refresh rate therefore the actions shots are never blurry. Plasma TVs are difficult to find but I believe they are the best overall.  This is the 2013 model so I just presume it has updated features from previous year models.I hung these on the walls in the bedrooms with a $79 multi-position wall mount (sku 364487)from Lowes. This made the perfect combination.  A stand is included free with the TV if you want to set it on a table and save money by not buying a wall mount.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R3F608RNJ6KUP3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking of a flat screen T.V. to replace an old CRT and this is the third attempt to find something that is budget friendly and quality.After following a CNET review I tried to the Samsung PN43F4500 plasma.  The picture and sound quality was great but the T.V. as a whole was unattractive and I didn't like the available settings so I took it back and tried the LG 42LN5300 LED-lit T.V.  Which was a much better looking, but, despite being 1080p resolution, the picture quality was horrible, there was noticeable motion blur and the sound quality was unacceptable.  However, I did like the available settings.  This finally led me to one of the few plasma's LG still offers and I couldn't be happier.The picture quality is awesome, and the sound is as good as you could expect with only two 10w speakers.  This is not a smart T.V. so it doesn't have all of those extra features I'd never use.  It hooks up easily to my computer via an HDMI cable and that gives all the \"smart features\" I need.  I can't see any pixilation with the 720p so don't let that scare you away.  The T.V. has great construction compared to the other two I tried.  This one has actual steel casing on the backside of the T.V. compared to the plastic the other LG and Samsung had.The Swivel stand is also another great feature that the other two lacked.  The quality of this T.V. just feels well above any of its competitors.  One other thing I like about this T.V. is that the on T.V. controls are located on the side of the T.V. instead of behind it, so you can actually see the buttons you are pushing.  I do use these buttons and I was rather frustrated at not being able to see the buttons I was pushing on the other T.V.'s.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Plasma TV", "Author": "KD \"Keli\"", "ReviewID": "RI41ZLBX2V3CG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our second plasma TV.  We have a high-end plasma and now this LG 42\" to replace a 15yo CRT.  The picture is excellent and compares closely to our MUCH more expensive plasma.  The swivel stand is a great feature and the menu has multiple options for the settings you prefer.  It has a shiny screen so for best viewing you should place in a room where bright light will not reflect on it.  I researched many tv's including LED & LCD and found nothing beats plasma in picture quality and price. Very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving my TV!!!", "Author": "demetria graham", "ReviewID": "RYOO0OMTEOX8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is awesome!

I thank them for that.Mary", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best television for the price.", "Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "ROVIAG9FUXX0M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I didn't even buy this tv...my 2 year old did when she got a hold of my phone and placed the order. I had every intention of returning it, but thought I would take a look and see how poor the quality was (I expected the worse for the price only being a little over $400...my phone cost more than that). From the second I turned it on I knew that I was in love. I've had this tv now for about three months and I could never even dream of returning it. The following is why:1. Great Picture. The picture on this tv is phenomenal. I always see those big flat screens at the store that are 1080p and the picture just looks weird to me. Almost life-like, to the point where it creeps me out. This tv does not bring picture quality to the point where it feels like I'm watching a play, but it does bring it to that point where I feel like I am watching a crisp movie that is vibrant in color. So, whenever my daughter insists on watching Barney's What's This Color?, she has no problems making out the colors.2. Great Sound. I've read that the thinner the tv, the more the sound quality suffers. But that isn't true with this tv, simply just because I believe that this tv is a rare breed where just about everything is perfectly made. Don't get me wrong, the speakers aren't as good as the $3000 audio set you in your car, but as far as tv's go the sound quality is through the roof. So, when my daughter wants to watch Barney's Let's Sing ABC's, she hears every single letter with clarity.3. Easy Setup. A lot of people have been complaining about this tv only having 2 HDMI ports. How many do you need? There's AV ports for things like your DVD player (who has $300 for a Blu-Ray Player?), HDMI ports for things like your Roku, video games, or even surround sound, it also has cable input for you cable tv. There are also others back there, but I have never had to use them. But what I'm saying is that when my daughter wants to watch Barney The Greatest Hits on DVD, then ten minutes later she wants to watch Barney Goes to the Zoo on Netflix, all it takes is the quick press of a button and she is on to the next thing of Barney.Sadly, I think that we may be watching just a little too much Barney. But, even though I may be a little sick of Barney, at least this tv has made it just a slightly bit more enjoyable. But I think it's time for my daughter's nap...one of the only time's I actually get to watch something for myself, so it looks like I have a date with a bag of popcorn, an episode of The Walking Dead, and a great tv to enjoy it on.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Bonnie W.", "ReviewID": "R3TALRDG3SEH6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is perfect for me, great picture and sound, wonderful features.

I have had it for 5 months so far and it is still awesome. It has a USB port and a couple HDMI ports with the standard AVI, Component, and Coaxial. Can hook up my ipod or laptop and watch movies from the internet, or use my pc kindle app and have a 50'' book! Awesome for my myopic little eyes. I invested in a wall mount for stability because the base seems a little insecure if you get the 50'' or over. Might just be me, because I have a 7 year-old and nothing is ever secure around children, especially heavy, slightly wobbly tv's. The picture is amazing, sound is amazing, extra functions are amazing. I'm pretty sure I covered it all in the title of this review. :) In five months I can honestly say I have had no problems and have been very satisfied. This tv at retail, at Walmart, for example, is about 800$, so at this price this tv is nearly a steal.

Have it mounted up on the wall, and has never let me down. Though most HDTV shows I'm watching are in 720p, unfortunately if you're a big gamer or have a blu-ray you won't get the 1080p quality. I'm not a big videophile, so I don't notice THAT much of a difference, but I do know my Sharp 60\" Aquos LED 1080p is definitely much clearer.But that's not a reason for me to give this TV any less. I was very skeptical about a plasma, but it was a great deal at my local CostCo, so couldn't pass it up.

Plus I had a $125 gift card from an earlier purchase, so the total price came in at less than $400.Even that was a little too much for a tightwad like me.As for setup, it took me longer to get the TV out of the box than it did to set it up. It was smooth and easy, just as my old LG LED had been. Hooking it up to my Roku device as simple and swift, just a matter of plugging the lines into the TV.Five stars for setup.The picture is very nice. I won't say it blew me away. It's larger of course and it does seem to be blacker than my LED.Four stars for quality of the viewing experience.The sound is just 'eh'.I'll give it three stars. I might find another way to deliver sound from the TV, a sound bar or something like that, as I like to listen to Pandora and music I have uploaded to Amazon.The upshot?Given the price, I can't see how I could give this TV anything other than five stars.I'm looking forward to having this TV for a looooooooooooooooong time.Cheers!", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Michael Lasher", "ReviewID": "R2Z5R0JXHGVZ0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not sure why this is priced so low, because it's value far exceeds the amount I spent.
