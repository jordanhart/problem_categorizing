Pretty easy and with Sony it already has Sony apps to rent/buy movies and it is also easy to setup for the ps3.The picture quality is amazing. Obviously the XBR is much better but to be honest I can hardly tell that much difference.The only drawback is the gloss and shadow if you have a bright room. Luckily my LR is pretty dark so its perfect with no flaw. If you like sports this tv is insane.If you have a surround system it must be 5.1+ because it wont take white/red conponents for your basic speakers, needs to be optical if not you can always put it in headphones....This has 4 hdmis and really light to lift.If you can afford the price (should be 1200 imo) its an excellent sony tv that has more equal power than other competitors (LGs HD Cinema-Panasonic-Samsung-Sharp Quattro).", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not too good, not too bad", "Author": "SylverCloud", "ReviewID": "RH0AC4AQS37GJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Was going for a HX929 but the price increase pushed it out of budget and I settled for HX750.This is a decent TV and I found cnet review mostly right. Colours are too good. Watching NGC and Discovery HD is really a treat. Blacks are really black like an other reviewer noted and its incredibly good. Downside is lost shadow detail. Shadow detail is not less, it simply is gone. Dark areas of picture appear totally black with nothing in detail or texture whatsoever. Motion judder is noticeable in standard and smooth modes (which are the ones recommended for regular use). I had compared this one side-by-side with HX 9 series and the latter humbled this at contrast and depth. HX 929 is still probably the best bet. But I felt the difference in picture doesn't justify the huge premium for 9 series.Overall, it might be a good TV, but overpriced for what it gives.**Update**I now painfully learn that what sony says in specs *youtube*, etc widgets have a fine print. That not the same youtube you would find in your browser. Its a server of videos from youtube, converted and reuploaded so that the TVs can play it. The regular browser cannot play even a single video on any website. Sony's explanation is that flash is not supported. This implies you cannot watch youtube live videos. Alas!Its now been 50 days of usage and the unit is running absolutely fine.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Sony Value in their Lineup", "Author": "David L.Camp", "ReviewID": "R131J77FT94RWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this from Amazon around Thanksgiving when I wasn't expecting to have to buy a new tv. My previous 40\" Sony Z series screen just died unexpectedly and the repairman said it would be $1594.00 to put a new one in. So I researched the sources to get this one which was the same quality level as the Z series and saved $500.00 over the repair cost! Its also 6\" bigger diagonally. The picture quality is beautiful and I really can't tell the difference between this one and the 55\" HX 850 I bought earlier this summer. Fits nicely in the spot of the old 40 \". Everywhere I went to ask opinions of salespeople about Sony vs. Samsung everyone said they would by Sony with their own money. I might add that this was the first time I've bought an item like a TV on Amazon but it was easy and very quick ( 2days even though I didn't pay for 2 day ship). I wouldn't hesitate to do it with them again.Sound on this model is actually better than my HX 850.Bigger, somewhat front facing speakers at the bottom of the tv. Think this is the best bang for your Sony buck.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Top notch, no bleeding", "Author": "R.

It began shutting off within a minute of being powered on...would power back up on its own, then shut off again...then the red LED light in the bottom left corner blinks 8 times, pauses, blinks 8 times, pauses, etc.We immediately contacted support via email after finding no \"fixes\" on the Sony website. We received a reply with instructions to try \"resetting\" the TV, which we did but it didn't work. We were then told that it would need repair and that we had to Call Sony Support on a NON-800# (on OUR dime) & ONLY between the hours of 9:00 - 5:00 pm (ET) M-F. We called on that Monday following (on Christmas Eve) at 7:30 am PT and got a person who would not believe that we had already gone through the reset steps with the other support person via email. We had to do it all over again with this person. He was difficult to understand and was a bit arrogant. So far this buying experience sucks. We're now concerned that the 55\" is going to do the same...if it does, it better occur during the warranty period.What's somewhat funny, although sad too, is that we own a circa 1975 Sony Trinitron (dial-NO remote)that I got as a Christmas gift while in high school that still works! Instead of the rabbit ears, we've hooked it up to cable & a VCR to change the channels (we set the TV to channel 3).We're waiting to get a call from a \"local\" repair person. Not too optimistic at this point, especially since it is the week of Christmas & many people will be calling customer support because they've found out their brand new Sony TVs that they got for Christmas are junk.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW - perfect picture even without tweaking", "Author": "Power User", "ReviewID": "R3K2LMC48DPV3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought an LG but ran into the same probem many others had that the LG Truemotion is not really on the 2012 LG sets yet despite thier advertising.  Couldn't wait for the LG firmware upgrade (some people waiting 6 months) so I tried the 46\" Sony HX750 instead.  WOW - no comparison.  The Sony was more expensive but worth every penny.  Sports are incredibly clear, etc.  I also use the variable output jack on the Sony to feed directly into a subwoofer.  Really adds depth to the TV speakers.  Can only do that with Sony (only ones offering the variable audio output).

I wanted to get a larger screen and also to have 3D capability. I am a big Sony fan, so this was perfect opportunity for me. This (46\") TV is no.longer offered by Sony, so now was the time to buy and get a great price. This TV has a really great picture. Setup was easy, as it was the same as my old Sony TV. There two issues which prevents me from giving it 5 stars. The online TV guide does NOT work because the company that used to broadcast it over the air no longer does so. If you hook the TV up to the internet (I am told by Sony support) you can get the guide information. The speakers are just awful as the sound has no bass or richness at all. I have fixed this problem by buying an \"under the TV\" Dolby sound system. In spite of these two issues, I love the TV and the picture quality just can't be any better. I am limited in the screen size I can use in my living room (50\" max) so this 46\" Sony was just the thing. I would recommend this TV highly. If you're thinking about buying it, you might not want to wait until they are sold out!I am updating my review, now that I have had time to use my TV for a while. I connected it with the Internet and that made all the difference in the world! The TV updated its' software and many new/improved features were added. Plus now I can access many things on the Internet for free! I have also had the opportunity to try out the 3D mode and it is just great!! I just wanted to update my review to say that I am so very glad I bought this Sony TV and would recommend it to everyone. Buy it, you won't regret it!!

Obviously nothing is going to be perfect with a bright room, but this TV handles the ambient light very well and gives off very little glare during the day.Overall, the picture quality is top notch (after some adjusting of the settings), fast moving sports look great, and the internet features work very well.

Person", "ReviewID": "RN4902NXF6PV2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, I am editing this (March 25th) to better summarize it now that I've tried most of what I wanted to try.Design- The tv does not have monolithic glass like CNET listed it as having, unless I am totally crazy or misunderstanding the term.  The screen is even difficult to figure out as far as matte or not... so I am assuming it's semi-gloss.  The stand is much less wobbly compared with the 2011 Sony stands.  The remote control is much smaller than last year's.  The component and composite inputs are now normal old school ones rather than you needing an included converter cable.Performance- The picture has a lot of pop and seems overall good.  To me personally the black level looks to be good as well.  However, I have no idea how that's even possible since it does not have local dimming and is edge lit.  So we'll see what measurements someone such as CNET gets (they are supposedly reviewing this set soon).  All these sites say this has \"frame dimming\".  Well there is no menion of it in the manual and I am starting to have a feeling Sony simply called the stupid light limiter feature frame dimming where people would think it's similar to local dimming by referring to it as a similar name.  There is no setting anywhere which sounds like any sort of local dimming feature of any sort!More Performance (lol)- The uniformity and viewing angles seem good for an led set.  Seems better than the 2011 sets.  I tried the nx720, hx729, hx820, and hx929 and in my opinion this has better viewing angles.  HOWEVER, here are the big issues with the set... it has horrible reflections and horrible bleedthrough/flashlighting.  The reflections are worse than the MANY tvs I tried last year.  The ONLY tv I have EVER tried which had mroe reflections is the LG LM7600!  If you don't have a light opposite the screen then maybe it will be ok, but it's hard for me to figure a good way of lighting my room without this lamp opposite the tv.  As for flashlighting... I do NOT believe people who say they have an edge lit led without flashlighting, no matter how dim the settings.  I have tried way too many top notch tvs (for edge lit) and they all have it.  Even the full array hx929 had flashlighting on BOTH sets I tried.  I would say this has the same amount the NX720 had.3D Performance- The main area I have not yet tested.  I do have 2012 Panasonic universal standard 3d glasses, which are supposed to work for Panasonic, Sony, and Samsung tvs.... so I can try it soon hopefully.Gaming- The gaming seems good.  This supposedly has a 4x speed 3D panel, which apparently does not affect gaming, though, because the lag still is not earth shatteringly different than usual.  I only tried seeing what Rock Band 3 would list it as and in Game mode it keeps being between 18ms and 32ms.  Hard to know exactly when using that game as a measure, but I have been doing VERY good on the songs so it must be close.  I even got high scores on some songs I had done badly on with other tvs recently.  I would say the lag is not worse than the Panasonic 50ST50, which I also tried.  The numbers could barely say so, but it didn't feel right when playing on it for some reason.  And by the way... last year game mode on the Sonys forced you to use dynamic audio.  This year it forces standard and with a separate setting you can turn surround on or off... which is nice because I hated being forced to hear surround sounding music last year if using tv speakers.  The speakers seem a bit better than last yar as well.The Panasonic 50ST50 I guarantee you is the best tv you can get right now.  BUT I get head issues from plasmas.  This tv gave me some headaches too, but I'm still trying to figure out if it's truly related to this tv or maybe left over from the plasma.Either way, reflections and flashlighting are trhe real issues with this set.  I may end up keeping it anyway if I can't get somehow adjusted to the plasma.  I would say yes for a 46 inch tv the best bet for an LCD is still the HX929, but it does have worse viewing angles and cost more.  I don't think I would even want to try the HX850.  Why spend $2100 for that when you can get the HX929 full array for the same price?So I guess your viewing environment is the main thing to consider when determining whether or not this tv will be good for you.  How they have the reflections so much worse than last year I don't know.  Maybe from trying to get that extra pop from a tv that is apparently semi-matte.  At least this is better than the LG, which has even worse feflections and atrocious gameplay lag.EDIT:  I just saw a comemrcial with text on the screen and it looked inky black.  It just makes no sense to me how it can be true though without local dimming.  Although, I do remember CNET saying some Samsungs achieved quite good black levels without local dimming.  But not inky.  So am I imagining things or is it really inky?  Who knows.  lol  Maybe the frame dimming is indeed a feature, but you can't turn it off and is automatic or something.More Notes: The cool illuminated Sony logo from the 2011 models is NOT on this one.  I thought that was a cool feature too!  Also, the sound quality form the tv speakers seems better than 2011.  I believe the NX720 was the one where the audio was atrociously bad.  These are at least decent.  Also on some dark scenes which I know from past viewing on tvs that there was a klot of noise in the picture on those tvs, it seemed much more crystal clear on this one.I guess I did imagine the good black level, because the sole bad comment about the tv in the CNET review is that it has a poor black level.  U did ntoice the picture looks washed out, but black text looked really black to me persopnally.This seems better for gaming than the Panny as I tried that again today and it was being bad.  So now who knows what i will do.  Probably either keep the plasma and use it rarely or else maybe try the hx929 again, but that bothered my ehad in some way as well and costs much much more than the plasma.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love Sony Brand", "Author": "Joseph", "ReviewID": "R38Y6EDQQWV6DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Because this product is very goodNothing can't replace sony brand in matters of qualityI think that work to satisfy consumers.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good one", "Author": "Sanjay Rohilla", "ReviewID": "R16HTBO881HKZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the right product which I was looking for.

I'm not a hateful person, but this piece of consumer electronics makes me have those negative feelings.Others have covered the picture quality etc. very well here, and yes - the picture quality is very good.  I haven't tried 3D, but anything 2D is great.  But..The Netflix implementation is the worst I've seen anywhere, and I have watched Netflix through many different gadgets (Roku, TiVo, PS3, Panasonic BluRay player, PCs, tablets, cell phones). Let me elaborate (and this is a true story).Imagine that your kid would like to watch a cartoon on the TV from Netflix.  Ok, you turn on the TV, and you click the red Netflix button on the remote... nothing happens.  You click it again.  Nothing happens.  Third click gives you a message \"Powering up...\" Ok fine, I'll wait, I guess Netflix will start soon.After waiting and waiting, I press the button again.  This time, the message is \"Feature not available\".  Huh!?  What does that mean.  I swear my internet is up and running, and Netflix still works on my phone, so their servers are fine.  I click it again.  \"Feature not available\".  Another click. \"Feature not available.\"  Frustrated, I go to the kitchen to get something to drink, asking the kid to play with something instead of watching the cartoon.When I come back from the kitchen, suddenly the TV program that was on disappears and the screen goes black.  What - did it break now?  After a few seconds, I get a red Netflix screen (very similar to the one you see when you launch Netflix from PS3).  It's loading something (horribly slowly... PS3 is faste).  Then, after another looong wait, I get to the menu to pick what I want to watch.  The TV responds to buttons extremely slowly (it's like it's thinking or doing something in the background).  I pick Dora the explorer and it starts playing.The kid is happy, sits down and starts watching.  After two minutes, the screen goes blank!  Sony logo appears - apparently the TV decided to reboot.  Great..  CBS comes on.  The kid has a tantrum: \"NO!  I don't want to watch this program - I wanna watch Dora!!\"  I start frantically pressing the red Netflix button again.  \"Feature not available\", \"Feature not available\", \"Feature not available\", \"Feature not available\"...  I wait, hoping that it starts by itself (just like last time).  Nothing, nothing for five minutes.  I press the Netflix button again. \"Feature not available\".In desparation, I go to the \"Home\" menu... that starts after a short wait.  I look for the Netflix icon there - I swear I've seen it there before.  This time, I don't see it there... and many others (like NHL icon) are gone too.  Confused, I click on \"Internet Content\" (at this point the kid is crying in the background).  A new screen appears, saying \"Acquiring Internet Content\" (or something to that effect).  A little bright dot starts going across the screen, over and over again (I guess it's an indication if content being 'acquired').This took FOORREEVEER (ok, it felt like forever when the boy is crying - in reality, it took 7 minutes.. and my internet is FiOS fast, and the TV was connected with an ethernet cable).  Then, finally, the TV is done 'acquiring', and goes back to the Home menu.  Lo and behold - now the Netflix icon is there, along with all the others that were missing.  Clicking it launches Netflix again (and just as slowly as before).After navigating the menus again (difficult when the TV is stuck thinking about something, but if you click the up/down/left/right buttons too many times - which you will, since nothing happens - the TV buffers them, and when it finally finishes \"thinking\", it responds to all those presses in a row, moving the cursor several rows down, past the row you actually wanted... how frustrating!!)., I'm able to finally launch Dora again, and this time the TV is happy and doesn't reboot.This is not a one-time occurance... this has happened to me three times now in a span of three months.  It's like the TV suddenly decides, in the middle of a working netflix stream, that it's \"internet content\" needs to be updated, reboots and waits for the user to initiate that internet content update (without ever actually letting the user know this is what needs to happen).  Awful - just awful.  And if the user accidentally figures out how to update, the TV updates ALL THE CONTENT instead of just the Netflix one (why else would it take 7min?).Oh, and the initial wait for getting the Netflix program/app to start after turning on the TV takes about 4-5 minutes, E-V-E-R-Y  S-I-N-G-L-E  T-I-M-E.  Consistently.  I contacted Sony customer service (chat) about this.  They asked me to refresh the TV's firmware (or software or whatever they called it) - difficult to find from the menus.  I did that in the hopes of this issue going away... it didn't.  After that, they told me to update the internet content..Great.  Why doesn't this happen with PS3 - another Sony product?  Why doesn't it happen with any of the other gadgets I use to watch Netflix?  Why is the whole TV so slow??So, bottom line: if you want this TV for watching TV, or 3D movies off your 3D bluray player, go for it.  If you want it for its \"smart\" features, I suggest you instead choose to shoot yourself in the foot with a BB gun, repeatedly, for about 10min - it's less painful.As for me, I had another Internet Content Acquisition fiasco tonight that broke the camel's back.
