I was looking for a small, energy-efficient TV to use in my office for times that I work in there.  As such, picture quality wasn't that important to me, but this TV does look good and I am satisfied with it.  I am not an audiophile/videophile, so I am easy to please.  It's not an HDTV, but I didn't need that.However, it's clearly a very bottom-of-the-line TV in features.  There are few features and options available on the menu.  The $99 CRT TV it's replacing had far more features.  There are only 3 video options for color tone (warm/cool/normal) backlight (bright/normal/dark) and a brightness slider.The first thing I noticed plugging this TV in was how tinny and weak the sound was.  There was no discernable bass, and the sound quality from the TV speaker was very poor.  I get better sound out of the cheapo radio I use at work.  I was considering returning it, as I listen to it more than I watch it, but I hooked up some PC speakers to the headphone jack, plugged in the subwoofer of that speaker set, and now it sounds great.  Unless you're willing to do this, though I would not recommend this TV.", "Date": "April 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV For Kitchen or Bath", "Author": "Reb", "ReviewID": "R2J0NNRJCQU3N3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After much research, we bought this TV to sink into a wall niche in our bathroom.  My husband will use it to watch CNBC when he is shaving, and the TV will be fine for that.  The picture quality is quite good, and the set up is easy. The sound is rather thin, though acceptable in a smaller room.  It reminds me of the car speaker mono-sound one experienced at drive-in movies.  (Apparently, no 15\" sets have good sound yet, so tinny sound isn't peculiar to this Sharp.)  When I removed the base, it took me a while to realize that, after you unscrew one screw that is deeply sunk, you have to turn the TV over and it will simply fall out. After two screws are removed, the base just slides out. Sharp, by the way, was singularly unhelpful in telling me how to remove the base safely; in fact, their agent said the base was not designed to be removed.  But a salesman at Circuit City said it's flat-screen 101 to know that all those TV's are designed to be hung, and therefore have removable bases or bases that flip up, which double as wall mounts.  He is the one who told me you sometimes have to turn the TV's over to get the deeper screws to drop out.  We will be hanging this TV on the Sanus low profile VMFL1 in black, which we also bought from Amazon.  It's a snap to install the mount.  The only reason I am not rating this TV a 5 is that the sound quality is thin, and the Sharp sales reps were not well-informed on the product's features.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "This is a great TV for a great low price", "Author": "G.

Contrary to the other two reviews posted for this TV, I think this is an exceptionally high-quality television.  The picture is crystal clear and the sound couldn't be better.  I replaced an old 13\" CRT TV with this beautiful device and wow, what a difference.  You can't really go wrong for the price...I fully recommend picking one up.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sound is horrible", "Author": "Fitzpatrick Insurance Solution \"Eric Fitz\"", "ReviewID": "R1X5RS7V3PT2FV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Why did I not listen to the other reviewers that said the sound quality was atrocious?
