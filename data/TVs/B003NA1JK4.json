I had an 8 year old panasonic lcd projection tv that worked fine but it was time for an upgrade.  After looking at CNET, Consumer Reports, avs forums and others there was a consensus that this TV was the best TV of 2010.  This TV has the best 3d and among the best 2d with some of the best black levels this side of the pioneer kuros series.After bringing it home and setting it up I am blown away.  The 3d picture is fantastic to a point while watching Avatar with my son he said \"Is this real!\"  The 2d picture is also spectacular with excellent black levels.  I set this tv up with my PS3, xbox 360, and Wii and they all look fantastic.  3d gaming on the ps3 is an immersive experience.Overall, the only thing is that it is not as thin or flashy as the LED's but they can't touch the picture quality this tv gets.

Vajrala", "ReviewID": "R7ZQY4ARKTPB6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I'm not a technical expert on any of LCD/LED/Plasma TVs. I'm planning to buy a LED 3D TV/Plasma 3D TV on the Black Friday. I read very good reviews on Panasonic Plasma 3D TV than an equivalent LED 3D TV. I've not seen a 3D TV yet myself, so myself and my wife decided to go to BestBuy(BB) to check out practically. Even before we went ot BB, I checked couple of my friends and they said I should go for LED and that is the only way and that Plasma is dead and gone soon. We reached BB and went into the 3D center and saw a Sony 60-inch 3D LED TV(don't remember the model # but the cost is close to 4 grand) and Panasonic 54-inch 3d Plasma TV(model # TC-P54VT25 54\" 1080p Plasma 3D TV). I told the technician that I wanted to see a 3D demo of the Panasonic Plasma 3D TV. He said the fixed mount 3d glasses are already attached in front of the Panasonic 3d Plasma TV and that I can go and watch the Avatar movie. I watched the movie in 3D and it's exactly like what we watched in the movie theaters and the colors are crisp and the picture quality is superb. My wife then watched it from the fixed mount and she said the 3D quality is superb. I then asked the technician to put the same Avatar 3D movie in the Sony 3D Bluray player attached to the 60-inch Sony 3D TV and asked for 2 pairs of Sony 3D glasses for the Sony 60-inch tv as there was no fixed mount 3D glass in front of the Sony TV. I watched by sitting in the front couch of the Sony TV and found the 3D tv reasonable. The tech asked me to stand up and move sidewards(any side) couple of feet and then there is the ghost image and the loss of the color and 3D effect. I did the same thing on the other side and the same problem existed. Then the tech asked to sit in the middle of the couch(my initial position). He asked me to bend my head any side, again there is the ghost image and the loss of the color and 3D effect. I bent my head the other side and the same problem persisted. Also the 3D quality of Sony is not as good as the Panasonic Plasma TV. At this point I realized that the Pansonic 3D tv has a fixed mount 3D eye glasses in front of it and we are not moving any side and that probably might be the reason for the Pansonic's better 3D picture quality. I immediately asked the tech to bring a pair of Panasonic 3D glasses. He brought them and I wore it now in front of the Panasonic 3D TV with the same Avatar movie playing again. I moved sidewards either side and bent my head either side. The picture was perfect, no ghosting and no change in colors and absolutely the same picture quality as it was when I was standing in front of the fixed mount eye glasess. My wife did exactly what I did and she said she saw the 3D picture without any negative effects. Also the 3D depth in Plasma TV is very natural and the colors are very crisp and this is not the case with Sony LED TV and 3D in Sony looked somewhat artificial.  As a last thing, I asked the tech to remove the 3D features and saw the Avatar in 2D mode and it has still superb picture quality with crisp colors. Coming to the price, Plasma 3D TVs are relatively inexpensive compared to comparable LED 3D TVs. The only reason most people are interested in LED TV is it is new technoogy, LED TV is sleek looking whereas Plasma TVs are little bulkier and that's my guess. As I've not seen all the features of this TV, I would give atleast 4 stars to this TV So, my advice to you guys, first go to a store like BestBuy and do some research before deciding which TV is good for you and just do not strike off Plasma in the first place.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Viera TC-P54VT25", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R1M2F9XRK8D4OI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me state my wife and I work on TV & motion pictures and consequently very particular when it comes to having a good picture and sound.  I've studied a variety of large format (50\"+) LED LCD & Plasma Flat screens for my living room. I can only equate it to car purchasing experiencing. Like most, I'm a true value shopper. High quality @ a super low price.  I researched tons of consumer magazines and online experts including customer comments.  It didn't really reconcile the dilemma of too many choices.  The old saying, \"the more you know, the more you know you don't know\" holds true. I'm not as TV Tech savvy as a Best Buy TV salesperson and still felt overwhelmed. That said, I understand LED LCD Edge Lit is the \"new rage\" and Plasma is \"fading fast,\" but I didn't want to get suckered into purchasing a screen just because thin is in or some \"expert\" told me this is for you. I was foolish and did just that.  I went to Fry's, to buy an LG 55\" 9500 3/D for $1,500.  A steal considering msrp is $4,999.  Of course, it was \"limited to stock on hand\" and they were completely sold out. I met a very nice Samsung Rep, who was very helpful understanding my needs and came home with a 55\" LCD/LED Edge Lit Samsung 7000.  My wife took one look and said, \"I don't like it.\"  Nuff said.The \"value electronics 2010 Shootout\" was the most helpful.  The judging and review by engineering experts & motion picture professionals backed up their top selections and rated them #1-6  with the specific technical reasons why.  The comprehensive coverage of all the major brands will surprise you.  Most people, including myself assume #1 would be priced way up there and not really a \"consumer value.\" It's not true. I was leary of an purchasing on-line but  Amazon addressed ALL of my concerns and offered a price that was too good to pass up. The TV + 2 pair rechargeable 3D Glasses bundle and new Denon 5.1 amp and along with 4 HDMI4.1 cables savings was ~ $1000.00 from the Samsung (which didn't even make the ratings!) and got the best screen per shootout results!The only issue I have is the TV only has ONE AUDIO OUTPUT.  It's not a standard RCA type connector.  It's a DIGITAL or OPTICAL AUDIO OUTPUT.  For those not familiar with new audio technology, a special light emitting fiber optic audio cable is needed to carry the audio signal to the amplifier. If your amp is far away, it may be a serious issue for because I think digital optical cables stop @~ 20 Ft.We are very happy with our choice.  Good Luck!If Picture Quality (pq) means the most to you, then read on...[...]Here are the results; pre is out of the box in THX or movie mode/post is after ISF calibrationWe exposed for the first time the following developments:Joe Kane lent us his personally developed new test disc that has some test patterns that expose flaws never before seen. We had a way to diagnose errors in the color decoding and bit rate limitations of the 8 bit panels as well as incorrect processing to the 8 bit panel.  Not only do these anomalies limit the professional calibrator, they also limit the out of box image quality.Bill Schindler demonstrated how plasma technology enjoys the benefit over LCD in 3D of being able to see an additional dimension the consumer can view from any side and enjoy a richer 3D experience, even while laying down.One of Joel Silver's and Kevin Miller's call to action was for higher bit rate panels.  Currently all panels are no more than 8 bit and some don't process the full or proper 8 bit signal. Joel was Skyped in on Panasonic 58\" VT25 while Kevin and Joel reviewed the .pdf presentation displayed on the other shoot-out panels.  Joel showed and explained that Sharp owns 75% and Sony holds the remaining 25% stake in their LCD plant and then discussed Panasonic's new glass manufacturing facilities. Literally almost  1/2 trillion dollars of financial investments in the future of flat panels and great advancements in R&D; and the manufacturing processes.DeWayne, aka D-Nice, Kevin Miller and Ed Johnson reviewed and taught us what they look for in various test patterns.Robert Zohn called for a standards to be established, likely by CEA or another standards organization to establish a method of measuring contrast ratio and have all manufacturer's publish only the approved contrast ratio standard.

Frank", "ReviewID": "R33B8IVT4O8C1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had been planning on getting a 3D TV to replace our 2D 42\" Panasonic plasma (now moved to the bedroom)  We initially looked at the Samsung 58\" and the Sony 55\".  When Panasonic made theirs available, we looked at it and preferred it.  Recent sale offers from Amazon caused us to get it now.First, the appearance of the set is superb.  Sleek, glossy black exterior with a touch of silver and a stand that looks good but doesn't distract you from looking at the screen will fit many decors.  OK, it isn't as \"skinny\" (front to back) as LCD/LED sets, but we've always preferred the color  and contrast of a plasma set.  Also, 3D appears more natural in plasma.The initial setup is fairly straight forward, but there were items I encountered that I felt required more than a 0ne line on screen description or short sentence in the manual.  There are many options for both video and audio, so you should find that things can be adjusted to your liking.  I particularly like the THX setting.I tested the set using the Avatar disc in 3D.  The quality of the picture was outstanding.  In some respects, it was even better than what I'd seen in theaters.  There were some scenes that had a slightly layered look in the theater, but didn't appear so with the Panasonic.  Now, if they will only release more good 3D content.The only negative in this whole experience is the firm Amazon uses to ship TVs, Home direct USA and the trucking firm used from the nearest terminal to my home.  The TV was picked up in Goodyear, AZ on 12/30  and arrived in Santa Fe Springs, CA on 1/3.  Its projected delivery date was 1/5.  When I'd heard nothing by 1/4, I decided to speak to a \"customer care\" person.  I really don't know if she was a bit on the slow side or was trained to treat everyone like a 4-year old.  After putting me on hold for a couple of minutes to call the terminal of American Relocation and Logistics, the trucker in CA, she came back on the line to tell me they disconnected her and would I like her to try again.  Then she came back and told me the people to speak with were both on the phone and gave me their phone number to call.  If she'd done that originally, I'd have spent 5 less minutes getting nowhere.  I called that number and spoke to a woman who looked up the waybill number and told me that though she hadn't received the information in their usual manner, she would schedule it for the earliest slot she had available, 1/6.  When I protested it was supposed to be delivered 1/5, I got the usual meaningless apology.  I provided each person I spoke with, an additional phone number I could be reached at if I was outside my home.  They all took it down, but the papers the driver had only had the original.  The driver and his assistant were quite professional and unpacked the set and tested it, while still standing in part of the packing box, telling me that for liability reasons, they were not permitted to attach the set to its stand.  Now, either that is buried in some of Amazon's fine print or it was a condition not included in the product description.  Attaching the set to its base requires two people or Arnold Schwarzenegger.To sum it all up, the TV rates 5 stars, the shipper, minus 10.UPDATE:  Almost a month later, and I am still in love with this set.  I have found one very minor flaw in the design that is so limited, most people won't be effected.  You can stream Pandora Radio from the Internet with this TV, and while there is a screen saver function, there is no way (at least, that I can find) to turn the display off while listenting to Pandora.  As I said, it is a very minor issue that won't effect many folks.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "One Word : WOW", "Author": "John Sagan", "ReviewID": "R19C85LOGU1Y2Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had a Sony Bravia top rated LCD TV and this Plasma blows it away....

(feel free to read why I returned the Vizio)  VIZIO XVT3D554SV 55-inch 1080p 480Hz 3D LED HDTV with  Full Array TruLED, Smart Dimming and VIZIO Internet Apps  http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JVPXUY0A7E10/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R3JVPXUY0A7E10I thought Plasma was dying technology due to the overwhelming number of LCD's at the store for the bad rap it gets for not being as bright, being too hot, poor energy rating, and image retention.  Problems which have been fixed on the newer models.  The brightness difference you're seeing at the store between LCD and Plasma is the reason for the consumer movement to LCD (IMO).  Though, once you get the TV into your home, LCD is much too bright.  Even on a sunny day, it wasn't needed.This TV has a perfect/amazing picture.  I've owned it now for 3 weeks and have seen zero noticeable defects.  Judder, ghosting etc.. Watched some content in 3d and I'm hooked.  Basketball, football, Xbox Black Ops, and Avatar has been it so far. (lack of cheap 3d content out there, had to upgrade to new cable box (no cost) for the 3d channels)  The movie and sporting events were amazing and makes watching in 2d lame.  I didn't care for the 1st person shooter in 3d though.  2d gaming is perfect with no delay.  I am perfectly satisfied that I purchased the right technology, Plasma.I sometimes wonder how the Samsung plasma compares due to the following:1) amount of online menu items seems to be lacking when compared to other brands.  When I was shopping for the TV, I was mainly concerned that it would have Netflix.  I've used YouTube and I now wish it had a browser as well.2) The Samsung remote looks much more professional than the Panasonic.3) When the TV is turned off, it's not nearly as modern looking as some of the other brands.Can't wait for Netflix to start renting out 3d Blue-Ray movies!", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV at close-out prices; wait to buy extra glasses", "Author": "Akamai22", "ReviewID": "RPMEGHHGJP8L9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have done a LOT of research - both reading and viewing TV's and had decided to trade up from my 3 year old 50\" Sharp Aquos LCD.  A lot of experts recommended this model but I was totally uninterested in 3D and worried about plasma.  A lesser worry was reflections on the glossy glass screen common to plasma TV's.So I was very interested to read that this highly-rated \"25\" series is to be replaced with the \"30\" series this Spring.  The initial reports are that the upgrades will be relatively minor and not really effect the picture quality which is, after all, what is the big issue.  So I raced off to my local video store and sure enough they had this model on close-out pricing $1799.  This is a great value for this excellent picture.So I got it home and all the surprises have been positive:1.  The 3D is really quite good.  Buy your HDMI cable and glasses from Amazon ( there is only one set included with the TV), as dealers always try to nick you on the accessories and cables.

This whole Viera Cast capability is very impressive; my Panny DVD player talks to my TV and vice versa.  I am so impressed I ordered a Panny home theater set-up.3.  Netflix streaming is excellent.... I had been using my Samsung Blu-Ray player as a Netflix source before, but now I have the ethernet plugged right into the TV.4.  The 2D picture is amazing.... while in the store I was able to do a side-by-side comparison with a new Sony XBR series LED with local dimming - - supposedly the best tech for non-plasma TV's.  It DID have a great picture, but no better than this set AND it was  $4k for a 42\" set!!5.  The salesman did a demo for me of fast-moving scenes... exactly the same picture source on LCD's and LEDs ranging from 60 to 240Hz and then this Panny, which is rated at 600Hz. This is the hands-down champ.6.  The screen glare is no different than my Aquos had in the exact location.7.  The off-center viewing experience is dramatically better than any LCD TV... the picture is sharp and clear and colors are excellent well past 45 degrees off-center.So my advice is to go look at this TV and if you like what you see, go for close-out pricing.Update Dec 8, 2011:All of the above comments are still true; we are very happy with this set.We actually have not used it for 3D since the first month; that's because we aren't interested in most of the 3D movies available.... not Panasonic's fault.  But when I mentioned to the salesman (Video Only) that we were mostly 2D viewers he explained to me that this set, being 1080p AND 3D has a much more powerful signal processor than a typical 2D set.  Be that as it may we just liked what we saw.  So I guess we are future-proofed if 3D grows in importance, but we're very happy with the 2D performance and that's what we bought it for.My only regret is in rushing to buy the extra 3D glasses.  I should have waited.I bought and used a calibration disk Digital Video Essentials Basic Blu-Ray Dvd Audio With Calibration Test Signals Descriptive Text which guided me through tweaking the picture to an even better level.  And stopped my wife from using the \"Vivid\" setting, which is truly awful.  [I was  surprised I ended up with slightly different settings than the \"THX\" setting, which is certainly very good out of the box.]UPDATE: Aug 5, 2012:No change to the rating or comments above.  But I have to mention that Comcast is broadcasting the Olympics in 3D (and Panasonic cameras were used in the process) and the result is SPECTACULAR.  They also are broadcasting a wildlife program from Africa and when the Land Rover goes off road, the plants going by it are very realistic.  Rhinos, giraffes, lions .... wow.Just makes me regret even more that there's not more 3D content available.One other small update: the set of glasses that came with my set requires that you put in a new (Cr2032) battery every 10-12 hours.  That is NOT an easy task if you have less than perfect eyesight or trouble with small parts.  The task would have been much easier if the battery compartment was on the outside of the glasses.... but it's on the inside, near the hinge.... most likely the location was dictated by a stylist/designer, not by an engineer.  The accessory glasses I bought (see above review) are rechargeable with a common USB cable so they are more convenient in this regard.  Finally, if you decide to buy accessory glasses look around... they actually are available in small, medium and large sizes... the ones I highlighted above are the mediums; if you want something else look around.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Satisfied", "Author": "Entity", "ReviewID": "R2CGFQR1TN83U7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well I wanted to wait a month before saying anything about the TV.

I will say that after viewing them at the store, all OFF \"Vivid\", it was a very CLOSE toss up.  The vivid settings are truly an overpowering eye strain that looks great in the store, but at home it is just to much. When I was in the store I asked them to take the same HD CD and play them in the same TVs.  My personal taste was the Panasonic.I have read many professional reviews along with many non professional reviews that all swayed me to my desicion.  It was a VERY difficult decision on which TV to buy.  It actually took me half a year ro make up my mind..... lol...... I am sure if you bought any of the higher end models, I am sure you will be satisfied.My personal results are that Panasonic TV is awesome with HD content and decent on SD.  I can't stress enough that this TV's stongest trait is its HD 1080 quality....... It looks very pristine.  I don't watch much of anything else so it was a perfect match for me.The THX setting on the TV seems to be the best setting FOR ME.  Maybe not you.  This setting seems to be the most accurate (go figure) and yet lets me play around with them a bit.I seriously can't say anything bad about the TV so far.  I have pretty sensitive hearing and I haven't heard any of this buzzing noise that others have mentioned.  I do agree that the LCD's and LED's are brighter, but I have had no regrets with the brightness capability of this TV.  During the day I turn on the C.A.T.S and it brightens it right up. At night I turn it off cause it seems to dimn it a bit to much for my taste. For those that don't know, C.A.T.S adjusts the picture to its surrounding light.3D?  To me it was an added bonus.  I have watched a few movies with it and is pretty cool.  I am sure future televisions and glasses will get better, but for now it is pretty darn cool.Burn in?  What is that?...... lol......

In THX mode and when watching Standard Definition programming, there's 1-2 lines of noise at the top of the screen.  When I switch to Vivid (which I don't like) it goes away.2. Occasionally the tuner locks into a channel in a way that it generates a lot of audio static.  Turning the TV off and back on solves it, but clearly there's an issue there.

Sorry to say, that remorse will kick in again once your set sees the other side of 500 hours or so.  My VT25 went completely dead in just under five months.  I told myself that these things happen and felt confident Panasonic would bend over backwards to remedy the situation.Calling the \"Concierge Service\" number (reserved for Viera owners) was a remarkably unpleasant experience and a portend of things to come. While I did not have to dismantle my installation or deliver it to their repair shop, it turns out that Panasonic does not carry an inventory of VT25 repair parts anywhere in North America.  That's right, repair components for the VT25 are shipped from Japan.  What's more, to save on freight, Panasonic ships them BY BOAT.Bottom line, when the VT25 fails, which it does with alarming frequency, it takes four weeks and more to repair.  The on-line service rep for Panasonic assured me that a four week repair time is normal for the VT25.  When I objected to that as unreasonable, the Panasonic rep said that amount of time was completely in line with Panasonic's warranty terms.Wow, had I known how likely a complete outage would be and how lackadaisacal Panasonic would be in repairing the VT25, I would definitely have bought the Samsung C8000.

Great price and came with a low price guarantee which saved me $40 off the price within 2 weeks of owning it. I bought this with the Panasonic starter kit and the Panasonic 3D Blu-ray  player. Total price for all 3 was $1929.00. If you plan to purchase this TV I highly recommend you purchase the starter kit and Blu-ray player. The TV comes with one pair of 3D glasses and the starter kit comes with 2 pair of rechargeable glasses and the 3D movie Avatar, of course in Blu-ray.Shipping,Shipping was fairly quick (8 days) considering I placed the order on Dec 27. The company called to schedule delivery, brought the TV inside the house, offered to set it up (I declined), removed it from the packaging and turned it on. I've heard nightmares from some people regarding the shipping of HDTV's. I had zero issues with the shipping company.Picture quality,I was having difficulties setting up this TV for the best picture quality, but once it was setup the picture was amazing. I went to a web site with the settings for this TV. I plugged in the values and the images were clear and crisp with no motion blur like some of the magazine reviews stated. There is an option in the 3D mode to choose 96hz. This setting eliminates the motion blur and flicker of the lower setting. The contrast is far superior to any of the LCD/LED HD TV's. Dark blacks and bright whites. Color is great.Sound,No one buys this level of TV without having a secondary source for sound. I run the Blu-ray and TV outputs to my stereo with surround sound. The TV audio is poor at best without using a secondary source.Options,I guess my only complaint is the internet connectivity. Internet connectivity using a wireless device is difficult with the USB wireless devices currently available. The one from my computer is not compatible with this TV. I did not spent a lot of time looking for a wireless device as I have a CAT 5 connection on the TV and my internet box. Setup was automatic and painless.3DThe best 3D viewing available today. It will take some time for your eyes to adjust to wearing the glasses. I felt a little queasy for the first 30 minutes or so but after that no issues with eye fatigue, headaches or nausea.

I expected to have this television for at least another 5 years (like previous televisions).One day while watching the TV, it abruptly turned off and would not turn back on. A small red LED light at the bottom of the TV was the only thing that flickered (blinking 11 times). I unplugged it and plugged it in again.  It would turn back on for a few seconds, before shutting off again (the red light blinking, mockingly).I called Panasonic and was told to bring it to a local repair shop where it could be diagnosed and repaired.  I was also informed me that my warranty had expired (the TV is only warrantied for 1 year) and I would be responsible for the repair costs.The TV repair shop diagnosed the problem as a bad A-board and fans.  The estimated price to repair it - $540!  I was shocked.  I called Panasonic and they said there was a possibility they would cover some or all of the cost. So, I sent the repair estimate and proof of purchase and waited to see if they would stand behind their top-of-the-line products and cover the cost of repair.I was told that I would hear back within 72 hours. 3 days later I still had not received a response. No phone call, no email.  I called customer service to find out what had happened.  The customer service representatives were friendly enough and confirmed that they had received my claim information, but they didn't know why I had not been contacted. They told me they would send a message to those responsible for repair claims and I should hear back from someone in 24-72 hours. 3 days came and went without any communication from Panasonic. Again, I called customer service. Though they were again friendly, I was told (once again), that I would hear back from someone in 24 hours.  I, again, waited and, again, heard nothing.  This scenario repeated for another 2 weeks and 3 more phone calls.  Finally (thoroughly exasperated and out of patience), I insisted on speaking with someone higher up.  I expressed my incredible frustration. My TV had now been at the repair shop for a month with absolutely no response from Panasonic! I had done all the work, repeatedly calling, spending numerous hours with customer service, each time re-explaining the situation.  Panasonic had made no effort to contact me.  After explaining this to the Panasonic representative and some discussion, he said all they could offer me was a little over $100.  I was offended, considering I had made all the effort and the repair costs were over $500 (a quarter the cost of a new TV!).  I expressed my disappointment and dissatisfaction and after more tense conversation, he said the final amount they could offer was $216.  I was forced to accept this, as it was clear the disaffected, monotone Panasonic rep would not offer a dime more.  I was left to pay more than half the repair cost.I am sad to say that all my faith in Panasonic products has vanished. If they are not willing to stand behind the quality of their top-of-the-line products (less than two years old), then I fear the quality of Panasonic is not what it once was.

I read a little about it and it seems that it is what plasma TV typically do (see also samsung buzzing).- while the DVD player(Philips, connected to HDMI-2) was still on, I put on the blu ray player (Panasonic, connected to HDMI-1) and the TV switched automatically to the blu ray channel and the display got totally messed up (pixels lightening up and parts of the screen sporadically and erratically flashing). Switching to the TV channel and back to the blu ray channel didn't do the trick and I had to turn the TV off and back on to solve the problem. I tried again but this time switching off the DVD player before putting the blu ray player on and everything went smooth. Probably some firmware problem.

I had already purchased a Samsung LN46A850 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with RED Touch of Color last year (actually 2009), and it's the latest model for that year that was going for 3x today's price! Not even the local stores had that model, and I got it online.  But enough of that. Today we will discuss my upgrade to Panasonic's 3D Plasma. I should have gone with Plasma the first time around--instead of buying the LCD. And maybe LED might be the new technology, but I am now convinced that Plasma is tough to beat! This 3D HDTV is all that Consumer Reports has stated it is after testing.  I am fully satisfied with this purchase...and if you're looking for Theater Quality viewing and sound, this is the TV for you!  The images are crisp, clear, and colorful!  The 3D effects with the glasses are amazing--no matter what angle you place your head!  When looking for a new HDTV a few years back, I originally was looking at the Plasma by Panasonic, but I shied away because of the alleged power wattage costs of the plasma and decided to go with the less costly LCD.  But I was never happy with the viewing image of the 120Hz LCD.  I really have not seen any big change with the 240Hz LCD.  Plasma has improved so much--from the days of ghost images or screen burns--that it no longer is something to worry about.  The annual cost might still be an issue for some, but I think that if the quality of the image is easier on my eyes, then the cost of plasma is a better deal.  Those of you who wear eye glasses might agree with me.  And the use of the 3D glasses over your eye glassware is not a problem with these neat-looking high-tech eyewear. Viewing TV, movies, Blue-Ray, and 3D movies for the past seven days has been wonderful!  My wife, who has been concerned about the effects of 3D on the eyes, has come to appreciate the better quality of picture viewing.  Since this is a series of reviews I will share with Amazon customers, I will stop here for now.  One more thing...the price: it was a steal!  As soon as I purchased the 3D TV, the price shot back up to its original price!  That was a 45% increase for the price I got it!  I am very happy I purchased it when I did!

If you use this for surfing the web, you better have some music on, because if not, you get treated to a 'zzzzzz' every time you see a white page (which is, of course, 99% of the internet.)It also tends to get really dim. I've changed brightness and contrast settings, and it just washes out the image. It comes with a few settings like 'THX mode,' and this does improve it, but the TV, for some reason, decides when it wants to dim, and turns the image down a few more shades than you'd like, all of a sudden. From what I can tell, you can't turn this off.I also had this odd flickering from the TV when I used a ps3. The screen flickers, loses a few frames, and sound cuts out too.

Thing is, even with replacing the problem, the TV still buzzed. They said it was 'normal' for a plasma because of the energy surging through it. It still had the flickering problem, too.Personally, I sent this back.

I've contacted the support center just after 2 week I bought the TV and after some discussions they suppose to call me back in few days, but I've never got back any calls from them... as we use to say in such cases... \"you can see a good day since the morning\"after one month an half the TV has dead! The shops were I bought it came to my place and picked up the TV and they kept it for almost a month... The shop just told me that they were waiting for a new board which got broken (later I heard was the PC card)... I was really disappointed and I asked directly to Panasonic VIERA support to replace my TV, so they told me to get back my TV and after that they could come to my place, collect the TV and start the procedure to send me a new TV... in this case, at least, I got a really poor loan TV! Previously I didn't get even that...Now It is already almost 2 months that Panasonic piked up the TV from my house and they suppose to call me back in few days... never got a call from them... I called them several time and every time they suppose to call me back in few days, but... as you can guess... I've never got back any single call...I'm really frustrated... I'm even thinking to buy a new TV and leave the other to them!!!I really don't know how to manage anymore this situation... :(For sure I'll never ever buy anymore a PANASONIC product in my life!and any other Japanese product, since I got similar problems with a SHARP some times ago... while, I should say, I've never had trouble with Korean products until now... just my experience.Hopefully my experience could save somebody else to the same troubles.RegardsPS: the VGA resolution is limited up to 1024x768! why?!?!?and if you should try to connect your PC through HDMI you'll be surprise!

Decided against the new LED sets because most cannot handle 3D, motion in sports, and certain movie scenes properly.  In addition, the line bleed was terrible in every set and only acceptable in the samsung and sony sets.  I turned to plasma and was impressed with the samsung 7000/8000 series and the panasonic vt series.  Samsung handled sd content much better...light years ahead of the panasonic.  However, I know 2 people personally that have had either buzzing issues or the heat issue resulting in the screen cracking.  OUCH!!  Well I went with the panasonic 54 vt and I have been impressed with the set.  However, this set is very very bad with image retention.  I am shocked considering I did all the break in plus and this set is worst than any set I have had or have seen.  Also, the floating black levels that I thought was overblown on posts is really a problem.  This is one of the main reasons I went with plasma is for the true blacks and for dark movie scenes.  I guess I will have to watch those movies on my 2 year old Samsung plasma.  My advice, save the money and go with a cheaper Samsung plasma set that has a proven track record.  At least there is less noise when watching regular sd content.  I just cannot see any advantage to this set.
