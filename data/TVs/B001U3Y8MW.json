The unit was promised in four days, they called and asked if they could deliver it in three.  They had two people bring it in, unpack it and set it up, plug the set into the cable box and plug the DVD player into the set, turn everything on and verify that it all worked. They showed me how to use the control, cleaned up everything and removed all of the packing and clutter.  Great job, far better than expected.

However, within 5 weeks of purchase, I began to have major problems. Here is a summary of everything tv related I experienced.After 5 weeks, the tv began to sporadically turn on when I pressed the power button, ie, it would take 10 tries to turn the tv on, then 20, then 30...then...it wouldn't turn on at all. Samsung told me it was a fairly common problem, and described it as an \"internal batter problem.\" Google \"samsung tv problems power\"  and you will see what I am talking about.I sent the tv in to the authorized third party repair center, CVE in Riverdale NJ. Repair was scheduled to take 5 days, followed by an additional 2 day period of testing to make sure the repair was completed. I received the tv about two weeks after they received it, and upon plugging it in to multiple outlets, the tv still did not work.Samsung does give a warranty, which is limited to repairs (potentially multiple) until the unit is deemed unrepairable by the official third party repair center, CVE. As of now, I have sent the tv in a 2nd time, and the only explanation I have received from CVE and Samsung is that the unit was repaired and must have broken again in transit. However, it seems to me that the unit was not repaired and that the battle to exchange the old unit for a new tv (which does happen eventually) is the absolute last resort for Samsung, in lieu of a customer's satisfaction with a product.While the tv was great when it worked, and it appears that my case is an outlier, I did want to alert others of this potential (and frequent amongst Samsung tvs) problem.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Very Nice HDTV For The Price", "Author": "D.

It replaces a 32\" 720p Westinghouse and while it has served well the side by side comparison of the two prove to be little challenge for the elegant touch of color. I always manage to be demoing theses things on Sunday and the sport of golf is always a good barometer to test the color rendering of a TV.Realistic green grass, accurate flesh tones and beautiful deep blue skies, a great example of color spread with no bleed over. I use the Dark Knight to test the blacks and the TV did a good job of presenting the different depths of black and where you  might find a Sony blending the blacks together you can see separation of images giving depth to scenes in a very dark movie.The one complaint might be that this TV isn't 1080p but I have to tell you the difference between 720p and 1080p at the 32\" size is not going to be that noticeable. Don't let that be a factor in your purchasing this TV.

The authorized repair vendor keeps saying they are waiting for parts, every time it's different and every time the part is special order from Samsung. Samsung 800# is useless, the escalation line has been down for a week, all you get is no help and a hang up. At this point, I really don't think I'll ever see the set again. Total frustration. Beware!UPDATE: Over two months and still no answers. Samsung said they will replace the TV but no action yet. Samsung reps are very friendly, but the process clearly does not work efficiently.

Attractive and sturdy.This is \"only\" 720p (although it WILL accept a 1080P signal just fine) and not \"120 Hz\" but here are a few things to think about.In 32\", the pixel density is higher than a 52\" at 1080p.  Unless you use it as a computer monitor or sit very close, your eyes just can't pick up the additional detail.  \"120 Hz\" is a buzz word and it is true that faster is better in LCDs but you need to look deeper.  A low quality panel that is \"120 Hz\" will not be satisfactory.  On the other hand, a high quality 60 Hz panel will be more than sufficient.  Not to say there are not high quality 120z panels but the cost will obviously be significantly more.In my opinion, this is a very high quality panel and spending more is a waste for the vast majority of people.  I paired this with the Panasonic BD60 and the results are phenomenal.  Up-scaled DVDs look gorgeous and I really don't think that you could tell the difference between Blu-ray from across the room (again, pixel density).  Viewing angle is better than I expected, contrast is great, blacks are so black that you almost can't tell the difference in a dark room between the black next to the frame and the frame itself.  Screen is slightly matted so reflections are manageable.  Verdict is still out on the sound, these speakers are better than I was expecting but have not had it long enough to be sure if they can stand on their own in all cases (loud movie action).It seems like there is a feature slope in televisions that it is hard to know where to buy in at.  I have to admit that even after ordering this unit, I was unsure if I should have forked out a little more.  After experiencing this, however, I have absolutely no regrets.  I think that in a 32\" it should be easy if you are able to separate yourself from the buzzword hype.  Why pay for pixel density your eye literally cannot see?

Keep in mind, the RCA still works great to this day, but I thought it was about time to upgrade.Putting it Together:This is the main problem I experienced with this tv.  It came with 8 identical screws.  The 4 that go into the tv went in fine, but the 4 that go into the stand did not fit.  I used all my effort to turn them, but they would not go in.  Either the screws were too big, or the holes in the stand were too small.  I emailed Samsung customer support and they told me to buy new screws online.  I was not pleased with this response.  When you spend $500 plus on a name brand tv, you expect it to come with parts that actually fit together.  I emailed them again and didn't get a response.  Finally I decided to go to the local hardware store.  I got some screws which were a little smaller and they fit perfectly.  So overall, this is something to keep in mind about this model.TV Appearance:The Samsung tv looks very nice from the outside.  I was worried about the red tint being too much, but it is barely noticeable which is good.  The tv looks all black unless you look closely at it from certain angles, then you can see a tint of red.  The touch buttons and clear stand look very nice.Picture:The picture on this set is very clear.  I tried it using antennae reception and cable, and it looks great on both.  When I 1st turned on the tv, the picture was choppy, but I think it just had to warm up because it has been clean ever since.  There are lots of options to adjust the picture, but the preset settings look fine.Sound:The sound is pretty good.  I had to play around with the settings to find one I liked, but once I had it picked out, it sounded good.Remote:The remote is ok.  It only took a couple minutes to figure out how to use all the buttons.  Changing the channels is a bit slow compared to my old tv, but it's not a big deal.Features:There are plenty of features on this tv, some are useful, some not so much.  The energy savings modes probably wont be used because they dim the picture and I doubt most people want to sacrifice picture brightness to save on energy.Amazon Service:I purchased this tv from Amazon (there are other sellers on this site, but I ordered from Amazon).  The 1st package that came was damaged during shipping.  Not to worry, I was able to send it back for a replacement.

This Samsung looks much better displaying standard definition broadcasts and, with its greater contrast ratio, has much better shadow detail than the Sony.  The Samsung's whites are far superior and it even has deeper blacks, typically a Sony strong suit.Unfortunately there are no free lunches.  Another reviewer mentioned, and I agree, this tv has a problem displaying reds.  After spending literally hours adjusting the picture controls using the AVIA test dvd, I still wasn't able to obtain accurate color and hue using the blue tinted filter.  Subjectively the Samsung's colors look excellent, except that bright reds can sometimes appear as more of a darker, maroon color.  Anyway, the effect is relatively mild and not nearly as distracting as the Sony's grayish whites.Overall, I am quite pleased with the Samsung and plan to keep it.  Just make sure if you purchase one of these sets to turn down the back light, which even in the \"standard\" and \"movie\" modes is much too high.  I obtained the best picture with the backlight turned down to \"3\".

But when I opened the box, I found that it was missing the stand. I called Samsung customer support, the guy said he's never heard of this problem and said he'd send me one free of charge that should arrive in 7-10 days. Without a wall mount, this TV needs the Samsung stand to be (safely) set up, so I was a little anxious for it to arrive. But after 10 business days, I didn't receive anything. I called back again, and they said there was no way for them to track the ticket at ALL, they couldn't even tell me if the part was shipped. I was pushy to get some kind of info, and was basically told that I should be grateful for getting a part for free - except it was a part that should have been in the box! All in all, it took 3 weeks for the part to arrive. And it didn't even include the screws - I had to go to a hardware store to get something that fit.That horrible experience aside, this TV is phenomenal. Don't think that you need 1080p or 120Hz, especially on a 32\" set. 1080p content is scaled by the TV to look great in 720p. I put this TV next to another manufacturer's 1080p 32\", and Samsung was hands-down better in every aspect. The screen has excellent viewing angles, and has a more matte finish, giving it less glare than most other sets. Calibration options are extensive, but if you don't want to mess with it, it looks good without any fooling. The integrated TV tuner picks up all my channels. The remote is easy to use, although it's not programmable in any way. Sound quality is good, for an integrated set of speakers. And after 6 months, I haven't had any hardware or technical issues, which is good because I wouldn't want to call customer support again.I think my experience with the missing stand is unique. But if you have to deal with Samsung customer support, be prepared for a little frustration. Despite that, I'm not disappointed at all about this TV though, because the quality is way more than I'd expect out of a 32\".

I bought this TV when the Amazon price was $439.00 (December 16, 2009). I did pay WA sales tax of $36.01. I hate paying sales tax when ordering online, don't you? I selected free shipping and received it on December 18th. I was surprised by how quickly I received it.I spent a month reading reviews of TVs and even made a master list where I used the process of elimination to figure out which TV brand I wanted (OCD). I was tempted to get a Vizio but I read too many negative reviews of their TVs. Samsung has the best overall quality and customer service based on the BBB website and customer reviews. I would've gotten a 1080p 32\" TV but, all of the knowledgeable people I spoke with online told me that there would be no noticeable difference at 32\" size with 1080p. They said it's not worth it until you get to 42\" size. I would research that aspect before you make an LCD TV purchase.The box arrived in near mint condition. There was a slight indent in the box but there was no damage to the TV. I'm sure that I'm noticing too much but I actually was really happy there was a handle on top of the box. That really makes moving it in the future a breeze. The TV is aesthetically pleasing, very sleek and modern looking.Setting up the TV is extremely easy. I didn't hang the TV up, I just put it on its stand. I plugged in my Comcast HD cable box via HDMI, hooked up the DVD player, and plugged in the TV. I popped in my \"Aliens\" DVD and the picture looked really crisp and clean.I can't speak about pixels and all the other technical aspects of the TV. I just know that the picture is really good. Perhaps since I've had a CRT all my life I'm too impressed with the picture? The settings were a bit overwhelming to me though. I might buy a calibration disc to adjust the picture settings.I would absolutely recommend this TV. I'm so glad I listened to the reviewers at Amazon and I'm glad they posted helpful and insightful information about the TV.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV!

I couldn't even program our TiVo without a working TV and the college bowl games are coming up so time was of the essence. We have a standard def cable box and an analog only TiVo, so HD is not important to us, but everything in the stores these days is HD. I had narrowed it down to the Panasonic and the Samsung. The Panasonic was $50 cheaper and the reviews and Consumer reports ratings were almost identical on the models I could find. When I saw that Best Buy and Amazon had virtually identical prices ($2 difference), I decided to go pick one up today rather than wait for shipping and installation from Amazon. I went there and they had the Panasonic I wanted on display, but none in stock. I started to go to another store that had them in stock, but the manager showed me this Samsung and offered to match the price of the Panasonic. We have a small Samsung in our kitchen and it's worked fine for a year now, so after testing the sound on this one and verifying that it looked good from different angles, I bought this one. It was a snap to install and my son helped me haul our big old CRT TV back to Best Buy for free recycling.

I contacted Samsung and after about 10 days a service tech came out and installed a new board. That fixed the problem for about 40 days. Then the same thing happened again. Another 45 days went by, and you guessed it, out again like the 1st time. A different board was installed and prob. solved, NOT!! after another month or so, it happened again. By not I'm getting frustrated. So finally after nearly 2 months of dealing with Samsung CS I got a replacement. They did upgrade me to this set LN32B460 since the other set was not available. This one so far since July 2009 has been working fine. It has a much better contrast than the 450 model, going from 10,000:1 ratio to 50,000:1 ratio.The bottom line here is that I did get some run around from CS and they were always telling me I would get a call and they never did. I stayed on them relentlessly until I got a replacement. Not sure if I will buy another Samsung just because of the poor customer support. The final time line took about 4 months to get a reliable TV.Samsung LN32C450 32-Inch 720p 60 Hz LCD HDTV (Black)", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just What We Needed", "Author": "R.

It shipped on time, and was delivered in EXCELLENT condition- no dents or scratches on the box, which was very comforting.the picture is incredible, I am not one to usually invest in HD, Blue-Ray and all of that, but the difference i have seen on this TV makes it worth every penny.  I have no problem with glare- even though the TV room is filled with windows.  The sound is great as well.  I had no problems hooking it up, it was very simple, and not too heavy either.Overall, i am more than happy with this purchase.

Redditt III", "ReviewID": "R1SYCPXE5159DQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok I have been looking at the LN32B360 for months now. Walmart usually has it between 420.00-448.00, which isn't bad. The Sony 32\" equivalant always runs $100.00 more than the Samsung. So, finally I go in there today to buy it and they jack up the price $50.00 more to $498.00 the same price as the Sony 32\" equivalant!!! So I try to tell a manger to give me the tv for the $450 it normally runs and he says no and to check online. I go online and the tv is the $448 it should be, but I have to order it online and wait to pick it up in the store!? Why can't the darn price be the same online as in the store. I guess that makes too much sense! So Walmart didn't get my cash. I considered Amazon, they do a good job emailing me tv offers as they can clearly see I have been browsing them. However, Amazon's price is in stone, what you see on the screen is what it is! So I went to HHGregg electronics where I know they haggle a bit! They sold me the new model up LN32B460 for $462.64! Thats like $71.86 less than Amazon's current $534.00. So you do the math. I feel I got a great deal.Now onto the advantages of this tv. I like the 50,000:1 Contrast over the model I was going to get at 30,000:1Response time is better at 6ms opposed to the previous model 8ms. Finally you gain a third hdmi over the previous model. Nice to have an extra one, but it's silly to have it on the side of the tv. Who wants wires hanging out of thier tv's side input? As for the Cons, there are a few. One is this touch of color crap, Samsung seems hell bent on making people get this. It's a faint touch of red that you can barely see on the tv's bottom and the tv's stand. It doesn't illuminate or add anthing to the tv. And why red? Maybe if it was blue I'd like it. The old model was plain Black and I'd have preferred this tv be plain Black too. Samsung is just persistant, and putting this red touch of color on allot of thier higer end tv's. So congratulations Samsung you forced me to get it! Next I don't like that they have done away with the S-Video input, not even one. I don't have a second HD satellite box for this tv, but the S-video output is on the standard cable box. So I could get a better picture from the tv had it. Instead I have to hook it up with a crappy coax. So I can't review how this tv performs with HD service yet. So all in all this is a top notch tv. The best you can get unless you want to pay another bill for the Sony. Styling is beautiful, slick, sleek, like a sports car. And the picture quality is outstanding!

Bought the 32\" set to replace an old 19\"er that had too small a screen for our bedroom, was losing whatever picture quality it had, and was overdue for replacement.  Went for the brand name which is more expensive than others, but got a good Amazon deal (not sorry).  Was able to set it up myself with realtive ease.The screen is more than ample for us, even at 8-10', and the colors vibrant.  What I didn't anticipate (but should have) was that my satellite box in the bedroom does not receive HD channels, unlike the one in the den where I have a digital video receiver receiving HD signals, with the result that the \"definition\" of the picture is less than \"high\" on the Samsung 32\" 720p HDTV.  Even taking into account that I opted not to go for a 1080p set (higher definition) for cost reasons, 720p should still be more than adequate for our purposes.  Right now, it isn't.The bottom line is that if we want the true HD the set should give us, we're going to have to order HD signals for the bedroom from our satellite provider and incur an additional monthly satellite charge for it.
