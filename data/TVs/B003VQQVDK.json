It is our first HDTV.  We looked at a lot of them in various stores.  I did a considerable amount of research and we finally decided on this one. Thought about a 120HZ model but didn't want to spend the extra money.  It fits our budget and we are very satisfied with the quality and functionality. Don't have a blu-ray player yet but have watched standard DVDs with component video connection and picture quality is very very good. Streamed a Netflix movie or two in from our PC via HDMI cable and have viewed a considerable amount of satellite and over-the-air programming for the last month or so. Both standard def and HD picture quality, very nice.  The volume leveling function is not perfect but it does help quite a bit. Sound with built-in speakers is good. Menus are user friendly and easy to navigate. Overall we are very pleased and would recommend this product to others.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "James L. Zhang \"Gadfly\"", "ReviewID": "RXZNT5JRTWGK6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yes, that old saying is very true.  Little after a year of buying the TV, it stopped working.  Contacting Vizio was no help at all for \"after warranty support\".  I received one generic message telling me that they could not do anything to help, and I should contact one of the \"authorized repair vendors\".  It would cost $120 just to get some one to come and check the TV.  If they need to replace parts, it could cost hundreds more.This is my 5th flat screen TV.  My oldest Philips plasma TV is still working after close to 8 years.  My mother-in-law bought a Vizio plasma TV about 3 years ago, it just died recently too.  They must have really poor quality assurance.If you HAVE to purchase this TV, you should buy extended warranty, maybe from a local store.  Personally, I would stay away from all Vizio products in the future.Update:In response of last comment, I decided to make an update.  I took some time to take apart the entire TV.  One of the board had a shorted out IC.  It was a board made by LG.  Searching the internet showed that there were none in stock at any of the replacement parts vendors.  I also found out that it was a common problem with this TV.  Without boring every one with technical details, it basically boils down to the power supply exceed the threshold of certain parts, causing they to overheat and burn out.  The problem is so wide spread, that the supplier of the parts could up keep up.  The price range from $150 to $200 for the board.  If you pay some one to do it, the cost would be another $100 to $200 more.At this point, I am just going to drop off the bundle of parts at local Costco warehouse for recycling.  The internal parts were mostly made by LG, some were made by Toshiba and other vendors.  Vizio is a relatively new company.  So this type of integration issue is expected.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love my new tv", "Author": "Debby Miller", "ReviewID": "R187LJ5PX11YU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this TV after hours of reseaching the different brands of Flat Screen LCD (and plasma) TV's.  I chose this one based on the excellent reviews that the professional reviewers gave it.  Their main comment was that it was a good value for the price.  It has a lot of options that you would expect on higher end TV's.  It was very easy to hook up too.  I'm a 5 foot lady whose husband was out of town when it was delivered.  It wasn't too hard or heavy for me to unpack and hook up.  Another good thing is that I have not had to use the instruction book at all yet.  The buttons on the remote are easy to understand when trying to access different features of the TV.One thing that seems small, but is something I really like is that when you hit the 'on' button, the Vizio logo changes from white to orange so you know the TV received the signal. It only takes a couple seconds for the screen to display, but you could actually turn it back off thinking you didn't hit the button right without that signal.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good value", "Author": "Kevin Mazzone", "ReviewID": "R75YOMNS10LU0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up this TV the other night from Sam's Club. With their Labor Day sale, I got it for $498. What a deal!Hook up was a breeze. It has component inputs that I could use to hook up my HD DirecTV receiver to, a Playstation 2 to the composite input, and soon a Blu-Ray player to one of the HDMI jacks.So far the picture quality is great for HD and SD programming. The blacks are deep and the other colors are vibrant. I bought this expecting the picture to be like a budget TV, but was pleasantly surprised at how nice it looks. I didn't expect it to even come close to my $1500 Samsung (52\" @ Costco).Finally I really don't notice the 120hz difference. My Samsung is 120 and I've turned it off since it gives me a headache, but I don't see any difference in picture quality.Hope this review helps...", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Satisfied... for now!", "Author": "Four Gee Sixty Three", "ReviewID": "R2X4ZCPWCG7DMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually was saving up for a Sharp Aquos 55\" LED Edgelit 1080P HDTV from here on amazon, but just busted on a random trip to walmart. I decided to just go for this TV and spend the extra money on a new PS3 Slim, and a couple blu-ray movies. This HDTV does not have the newer tech, like advanced refresh rates (60/120/240 hrz) or LED lighting versus flourescent bulb lighting in this one, but it DOES have what is considered by most now to be the standard for HDTV viewing, and that is 1)1080P full high-def resoultion, and 2) at least 42\" in viewable size. Blu-Ray disc playback via Playstation 3 worked fine, but I have seen better 1080p images on slightly more expensive sets. This TV does a DECENT DVD-upscaling job via the Playstation 3, but again, I have seen better and can notice the difference right away. My buddy's 47\" Samsung 1080p 120hz does a much more noticeable job of DVD upscaling, proving its the TV that does the job, not the component (in this case, Playstation 3). All in all, for the average user, these quibbles will not make too much of a difference, as I am leaning toward the videophile side, so my eye is already trained to spot these differences. Don't let this dissuade you, this is a great HDTV for the money and will satisfy most people looking for a decently-priced ticket into the HD world.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV!", "Author": "ConTeacher", "ReviewID": "R3F9LQMGDEB9P9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got this TV a little over a month ago and are very happy with it.

It is light weight, & can be hung from the wall like a picture with the proper tv mounting apparatus.  It is an excellent choice for WATCHING tv which, is what I bought it for. It has good, clear internal speakers but, they do not produce that \"movie-theater sound\".  It does have the ports needed for hooking up an additional sound system, dvd, etc., if desired.Being technologically challenged as I am, I do not completely understand all the specs on this tv.

My little emachines computer looks brilliant on this screen.  Changing from computer to Timewarner (gag) or PS3 is easy.  This was made for people not technically inclined like myself.  The logo does stay on below the screen when plugged in (as someone else stated), but this is not something big enough to bother me.  The sound....could be better but what tv really has great sound anyway.  That's why we get surround sound RIGHT??Anyway, this is for my bedroom and I feel like I've spoiled myself.  The only thing odd is volume jumping (highs and lows).  This is only a problem if you are trying to keep the noise down for other people in the house.  If you can turn it up you won't be bothered with it.  But if the volume is low you might miss part of the dialogue in a movie.  This could be the programming though... just not sure.  If you are setting up surround sound anyway and want a big LCD for little money and excellent picture then you won't be disappointed.Oh strange thing, (this could be that I bought this used from amazon market) there were screws missing for the foot of the LCD (what is stands on).  I was about to flip out but when the foot attached and I heard a suction type noise I realized this won't come off that easily anyway.

Or two month after my 3 year extended warranty ended.  I contacted Vizio and was told that out of warranty units had to be repaired by their authorized repair representatives.  I asked for their Massachusetts representatives telephone numbers.I was only given one--HD Repair.  Vizio assured me that HDR could take care of me.I called HDR and was told that they would diagnose my TV over the phone and send me a quote for parts needed.  Once I paid for it they would order parts and send a repair man to install.  All I needed was to give them my model and serial number.  I told them I couldn't get that info immediately.  I would call them back with the info.I then searched them out on Google and found that they are a Florida based company and they contracted repairmen in every state to do the on site installation.I don't know about you, but I certainly do not trust anyone that claims they can diagnose a problem over the telephone.So do not buy Vizio.

Setup was a breeze, very easy and had the TV working in just a few minutes.The picture was not very bright at first, but after making several adjustments under picture settings, the picture brightened up considerably.  I do not see any difference however in the brightness with the windows wide open, I still have to shut them at least partially in order to see the picture well.  I have this feature set on high, maybe that is the wrong setting?The picture is very clear and I have no complaints about it once the brightness got OK.  It seems like the movies from Netflix (using an internet-connected LG Blue ray player) are really really good quality, as are videos, movies from other internet channels (I got rid of DirecTV).The sound -- here's the bad part.  The sound from the TV speakers is horrible.  I am not an audiophile, but it really is pretty amazingly bad...very thin, tinny, sounds like it is coming out of a tin can.  I made several adjustments under Audio settings, but none of them could make it sound much better.  However, I am using the same (very very cheap) surround system I used with my previous (oldstyle) TV, and the sound from that is awesome...even better than it was before.  I attribute this, however to the LG player, not the TV.I am satisfied so far, but certainly would not recommend this TV to someone who does not have external speakers.  Perhaps more to come later...UPDATE:  I have now had this TV for 17 months.  Narrow, vertical, purple lines are showing up on the screen, there are three so far and they keep getting darker.  I have contacted Vizio, but don't expect any help, since my warranty expired 5 months ago.

Vizio TV's are cheap, and they appear to give you the biggest bang for your buck, but they simply to no work as promised.  I purchased a Vizio XVT553SV which, at the time, was their flagship model.  Immediately, it had video artifacts/flickering on every input (Dish, PS3, media player).  Vizio's website even admits to this and promises that a firmware update and clean storage procedure would fix this!!! Vizio updated the firmware, and the issue appeared to be resolved for a few weeks, but then returned.  Vizio customer support had me do a power recycle, which resolved the issue for a few weeks, but, again the issues returned and new ones appeared - the video would freeze upon a cold start-up, the TV would turn off automatically in the middle of watching TV for no reason whatsoever. Vizio technical support had me do clean storage procedure which appeared to resolve the issue for a few days, but then the issues again returned.  Technical support  also admitted that the issue of the TV turning off intermittently will still be an issue until Vizio updates the firmware and they are looking into this issue now.  Through these issues, we could still watch TV - the issues were merely a nagging nuisance.  Finally fed up and fearful that the TV would fail once out of the warranty period, I called Vizio and they sent out a Technician to replace the logic board.  Within an hour after the technician left, the TV failed altogether.  Vizio now wants to replace my new TV that was defective upon arrival with a recertified TV which I objected to.  In order to get a new TV, they want me to pay an extra $300.00 plus tax!  I asked \"Ashley\" of Vizio customer support how she would feel paying good money for a \"new\" TV, but instead, getting a recertified TV.  She said she would be upset but this is their corporate policy.  So, buy a Vizio at your own risk - because it is very risky to do so.

The color sharpness is pretty amazing.  After watching 6 NFL playoff games, 1/2 dozen Blu rays, and regular satellite HD TV the picture at 60 Mhz delivers an amazing experience.  Watching snow fall during the Bears Packers game was pretty nice - we thought we were front row upper deck!  We only have had the TV for 3 weeks so we can't comment on the longevity but so far - great TV!  The TV's sound quality is also really good - but we upgraded to a surround sound to complement the TV's overall experience.My only advise is to consider a faster shipping method than standard.  The TV arrived 12 days after purchase through Home Direct.  The delivery people were friendly and courteous but the TV shipped from Arizona - almost the other coast away - and we missed a weekend of football.

Here's why:I already had a Vizio VX37L at home. I also have an old Hitachi CRT TV that's rated 720i resolution (a very uncommon thing for a CRT TV.) I began by buying a Vizio E3D420VX. I set it side-by-side with each existing TV one at a time. I fed the same signal into both the E3D420VX and one of the old ones simultaneously. I compared the two TVs with standard definition 480i digital (from my satellite box), with 480p from an antenna, and then with 1080i from the antenna. (I don't yet have HD service from my satellite provider.)With all three signal types, the old TVs were each noticeably better than the E3D420VX. The E3D420VX was not as bright, even with the backlight and the brightness turned up to 100%. The colors were not as vivid and not as true as on either of the older sets, regardless of how much I adjusted the color settings. With the 480 signals, the E3D420VX showed a lot of pixellation around the edges of everything in the picture. Even with the 1080i signal, there was a little more pixellation than with the old TVs running at 480i. Finally, the sharpness was noticeably worse on the E3D420VX.I next tried a Vizio E421VO. With the same tests, the results were nearly the same; both the old TVs out-performed the E421VO.I decided to try one more time. So I bought a Vizio M420VT. It's a keeper! The picture is bright, the colors are true, and the 1080i is sharp with no pixellation. With the 480 signals, there is still some pixellation, but it's acceptable if I sit back at least ten feet.

We were not thrilled with the picture quality, widescreen movies made people appear shorter and fatter than usual.  When we found this deal it was a no brainer to spend the extra $50 to get a bigger and better TV.  Couldn't be happier with the swap.  Since this TV is for our bedroom we were especially happy that the Vizio insignia on the front lights up orange when powered off, as the 37\" Vizio from Target would light up white, bright and made it very annoying when powered off and trying to sleep.So far so good on this model, I hope this TV lasts us a good long while as we really really like it.

It is a beautiful TV and we hooked up surround sound to it.  The shipper that Amazon chose for delivery had a lot to be desired.  It took 1 week longer than the estimated time shown when I purchased the item.  I think it was Pilot Delivery that delivered the package.  They treated the package well, but was really late.  Had to schedule an appointment for delivery and because there were no appointments on the designated day, it was pushed to the next day.  I will take this into account next time I purchase a big item from Amazon...", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "black screen of death in only 4 months", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R87VBEA6S0F74", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The title says it all, I am surprised Vizio had been getting good ratings and it was a best selling tv.

I plugged the TV and scanned for channels...... A nice picture appeared....Then after 5 min a loud \"POP\" sound took place and the audio disappeared!Checked whether I have muted it accidentally - no!Plaid with the volume up and down - no sound at al!~Turn off and on the TV again - sound worked.5 min later - \"Pop\" - and no sound!Gave it another chance... unplugged, re-plugged the TV - same thing - the audio disappears after about 3-5 min.Do not buy this particular model Vizio! It has a major issue with the motherboard. Vizio do not want to admit it - the QA technicians probably just plug it for a 1 minute - if shows picture and sound - then they pack it and send it to the stores as working model!I am sending it back on Monday!What a waste of money!
