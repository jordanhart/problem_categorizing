I found the Vizio VA19L, 19 inch, LCD HDTV. It has an amazing 5000:1 contrast ratio. In reasearching all of the other comparable brands in the $300.00 or less category, I could not find anything above 1000:1. So I found one on Amazon, ordered it on March 13, 2009, and then received it on Friday, March 20, 2009.By Monday, March 24, 2009 there was a big problem. While watching TV, the screen went green with vertical and horizontal static lines along with a loud blast of static sound. After about 4 or 5 seconds, the screen would go dark, the TV was still on as per the frontal lit up VIZIO logo under the screen. It is white when the TV is on, and orange when it is off. The TV, although on, would not respond to any commands, including of course, power off. No matter if it was from the remote or attempting to manually shut it off from the side panel of the set.I unplugged the power cord, waited about 2 minutes, then plugged it back in. The TV would come on normally and then, sometimes within 5 minutes or 5 hours, it would happen again. The picture itself was very dark now compared to the first three days I had it, and no setting change would fix it. I contacted the seller immediately by phone and told him of the problem. He agreed to refund my full purchase price. I shipped it back UPS and it was delivered April 7, 2009. On April 12, 2009, I emailed the seller through Amazon regarding the refund status and then received a reply from Amazon the next day that the refund has been processed.I did try to fix the problem first by ordering a replacement power cable but that did not resolve the issue. PLEASE...please learn from my mistake. Do not EVER purchase something that is advertised as \"Refurbished.\" Just find a seller who is advertising brand new and pay the extra few bucks to avoid all of the hassle. For me this was difficult as I am disabled. Also, I'd recommend checking EBAY (no offense Amazon). I purchased another Vizio, brand new for $183.00! It was a pick-up-only which was no problem as the seller lived 20 minutes from my house. This TV absolutely, positively blows away the competition.

I had a USB TV Tuner which worked well, but I decided to buy a TV to relieve some of the stress I was putting on my laptop. I looked around for smaller TVs seeing as I live alone in a dorm room and don't have enough space for a TV much larger than 20\". In addition, I wanted something small enough to be able to ship home without paying an absurd amount of money. After browsing the selection at Amazon, I decided to go with this TV since it was small, relatively cheap, and from a brand name I at least recognized.I was a bit worried before the TV arrived based on some of the complaints about picture and sound other reviewers have cited, but I must say I have had no problems with this television. It is true that when not viewed at a direct angle the image gets a bit darker, but most electronic screens are similar (my laptop does the same thing) and the smaller size likely amplifies this effect. Still, I never got frustrated with this little quirk. Also, I'm OK with the sound quality. I can hear it rather well on lower volumes and it sounds clear to me (I mean, you can't assume a TV was built with incredibly nice speakers - most people buy those separately). It does have a headphone jack, so if you wanted you could just buy a cheap set of laptop speakers for the television if it bothers you that much, but I see no need. It seemed to me that some of the connectors in the back (I'm assuming for S-Video and some others) were a little cheap looking, but since I don't own anything that I can hook up to such connectors I can't really comment on whether or not my instincts are correct. The AV input on the left side of the TV is out of the way and convenient - it's nice to not have to ruin the aesthetic beauty of the TV by having AV cords sticking out of the front as would be the case with some TVs. I have not tried using it as a laptop monitor quite yet nor have I used the HDMI input, so I may update this review once I have done so (I plan on hooking my XBox 360 and laptop up to this TV next fall when I'm in a larger living area).If you are looking for a small television to fill some niche in your home, I would recommend this TV. It probably isn't the most flashy item on the market, but I was satisfied with the video (digital channels look gorgeous as you may expect) and audio quality of the TV. While I was a bit hesitant on spending $200 on a television that I may have only used for a few months, I believe it was a good investment and plan on using this TV for a few years now.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "One of the best bargains out there", "Author": "D.

I called them up and ordered a converter box, which was a piece of s***. It broke with 2 weeks of me owning it, trust me they are not worth your time.So I was without TV for a few more weeks and then I was doing my weekly shopping trip to Target when I found this TV, went home and did a little research then went back and bought it.  What a TV for $200. It includes all your legacy connectors like BNC, composite, component, s-video and even includes (2) HDMI connectors. All the different inputs are selectable via the remote and the buttons on the side.Picture quality is excellent, not at the level of a Sony Bravia or a Samsung, the only other 2 brands of LCD TV's I would even bother with, but close Don't get me wrong, Pioneer and Sharp make excellent TV's, but with these three you get comparable quality for a lot less. This tv has 2 stereo speakers in the back, you definitely want to get external speakers or use some kind of receiver as the sound is somewhat muffled.Oh and for setup they include a giant, foldout poster but you don't even need that. Unpack it, put the stand on, plug the antenna (if you are using OTA like me) plug it into the wall and follow the prompts for language and channel scanning.As for the size I could have purchased a 32\" tv for about $500, but if you are a single person like me, no kids and rarely have people over then there is no point in getting anything bigger. I have nothing to prove to people, that is what some people out there buy huge tv's for, to show off to other people.

I'm satisfied I couldn't have made a better choice.My old CRT set with an indoor antenna never delivered anything but two VHF channels, one pretty well and the other just barely watchable. Since it didn't give me any UHF whatever, I was concerned about whether I'd get anything on OTA digital since that uses UHF frequencies. To my pleasant surprise, this Vizio on an indoor antenna gives me 17 digital channels in excellent quality, five of them HD. And standard 480i programming looks great on it too, which is certainly not true of all HDTVs.It also replaces the 19\" widescreen monitor I had on the computer cart beside my bed. The TV's 1366x768 resolution does not exactly match any standard computer resolution, but again to my surprise, the old Radeon 9600 graphics card in my small form factor system provides 1360x768 which fills the screen perfectly while properly maintaining aspect ratio. And I find my Samsung NC10 netbook does also, though I don't really expect to use that much with the Vizio.Reading other reviews here I see a number of users complaining about the sound quality and angle of view. I think the sound is just fine for a small set, speech is nice and clear, and since I'm hard of hearing I would sure notice it if it weren't. As for angle of view, perhaps those complaining were used to CRTs. Of course all LCD flat panels have noticeable light fall-off when viewed from an extreme angle, and I have seen some laptop monitors where this was very bad, but the Vizio is just fine as far as I'm concerned -- seems about as good to me as the 32\" Samsung I have in the living room.There are even a few things that I like a lot better than the bigger set. On my Samsung there's just one button for changing inputs, which means you have to cycle through several to change from TV to DVD player and/or whatever else you have connected. On this Vizio there's a separate button on the remote for each input, which is much more convenient. Also, the Guide button on the remote brings up brief program info not only about what's playing now, but also what's on the schedule for several hours ahead. This is very handy, though I suppose it may depend on the particular stations in your area -- I don't know if it does this on cable also since I don't use this TV on cable.I've had this Vizio now for about seven months, no problems of any kind, and it gets an easy five stars from me.

Plenty of connections on the back of the TV for component and HD accessories so you can use just about anything with this TV.

Before digital became law, my old analog set which was connected to my antenna in the attic, could only pick up about 10 channels, most of them fuzzy.I connected this Vizio set to that same antenna and it found 40 digital channels and 8 analog channels in Mexico (I live in Arizona).  Although I \"No comprende Espanol\", that is an overall impressive number of channels received over an attic antenna.Even the weakest channel is far superior to what the old analog set produced.The picture quality of the strong channels is excellent and contrary to what other reviews have said about sound quality, I find no problems whatsoever with the sound.I give it a 4 star on appearance only because the backlight behind the Vizio logo at the bottom of the frame remains lit in amber when the set is turned off.  In a dark room at night when you want to sleep, this light appears rather bright.  The only means of eliminating it is to cover it with something or unplug the set from the wall.Final note.  If you have an attic or rooftop antenna, don't swallow that baloney from sales reps about needing to buy a specialized digital antenna.

Perkins \"Frequent buyer\"", "ReviewID": "R3N1MWBPEXTSPS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product is great - Vizio is a solid brand and great value.  Still, a great TV doesn't help when you've got Comcast as your signal source - as they require a digital converter box so they can earn more money from you - despite the digital tuner in the TV going to waste.Add to this, none of the TV retailers tell you this - you have to find this out after the fact.  Amazingly, the Amazon partner I bought this one from was disgruntled enough with my 'good' rating of his lack of disclosure that he called me.  I give him credit for caring, but took that back the moment he complained about it not being his problem that Comcast requires a converter - and making it clear he was only concerned about earning the highest rating.  I would have revised my rating of his company if he hadn't stepped over that line.Anyway, Vizio is a great product and strong value for your money.  That said, be really sure you've fully investigated what sort of signal processing you'll require given your signal source - cable, satellite, terrestrial (digital requires a special antenna) or you'll find yourself stuck just like me.  I still think it'd be smart of TV retailers to TELL you this and help you think through the options up front... they'd certainly earn my loyalty/consideration/advocacy.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Second try much better", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2XYZ051LGA80E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After receiving this 19 inch Vizio the picture went out after being on for five minutes.

It took four full months to resolve, so plan on keeping this TV or spending around four months to get your refund.  1) the TV has very poor audio.  I have a 12-year-old 15\" Sony with exceptional audio compared to this.  2) There are no on-board controls whatsoever.  3) the remote is so poor that being about 6\" close and pointing it directly works only on about the 10th try.  4) Even after a very slow cable channel download, the resolution is so bad that again the 12-year-old 15\" Sony was far superior.  It was out-of-focus without remedy.  I soon questioned whether it really was a Vizio.  Upon deciding I didn't have to waste my money like this, the four month return nightmare began with Direct Distributors.  They don't answer their phone, and will only email when they feel like it.  Then, after it is delivered to them, I assure you there is no refund.
