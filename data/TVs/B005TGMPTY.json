Has the most awesome picture I have ever seen on a Tv.  Got around to hooking up the Internet yesterday and the set died as dead as dead could be.  All I was doing was going through the network connection menu.  Call vizio, service person coming to repair but will be at least a week.  Except for it dying I would have given it 5 stars.  I will revisit this review after repairs are made.So the repairman came.  Replaced two circuit boards still not working.  He wasn't very bright, arked (sp) one of the boards.  Now waiting on second repair.  Still within my 90 day return policy.......Got tired of waiting for repairman.  Called Vizio again.  TV listed as a failed repair.  being replaced with M3d420SR.  I have very high hopes for this new tv.1/31/2012  The new TV Vizio sent arrived.  They replaced the 42 with a 46 and it is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Only had the tv a couple of days now and the picture is out of this world.  But my review is really about Vizio doing everything to make it right.6/25/2012.  So can you believe it,  six months and now this one died and I'm getting another replacement.  It's fine that they replace it with no hassle but why not just make a Tv that lasts.  This will be the third one since thanksgiving.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "very happy with my purchase", "Author": "K. karamalakos", "ReviewID": "R3GUNQP4BCI25I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "so on black friday i went to walmart picked up the last VIZIO M3D420SR brought it home to find out the screen was damaged so i called wal-mart and they told me the only thing they could do for me is to give me a refund, but i wanted to keep the tv because of how good of a deal i got so i called VIZIO. they told me they were out of the 420 model so they sent me the 421 model which at the time went for $1600 on their website, so i was shocked and extremely thankful for the support!!! after owning this tv for a few months i can say the picture is crisp the sound is better than a lot of other higher end tv's and the 3D is just a bonus btw the 3D only plays in 720p not that that bothers me and the internet apps... well i could care less about having it or not in the end my $630 went a long way there is no way i could of got a better tv for the price this is my 2nd vizio and i'm sure there will be a third. ;)", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vizio TV", "Author": "Marci1963", "ReviewID": "R1HLVE6Y7BVS2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS; I love the picture is amazing. The TV is thin & ligt. No heavy lifting installing it on the mount. Sound is good enough. Works great with my wireless internet. Netflix is excellent on it.CONS; I have the blutooth Vizio headphones paired with it. When I turn on the TV the remote control is not useble until I turn on the headphones too, or I turn off the blutooth audio on the TV. (Remote is also blutooth.)

I'm a gamer and I never hear much on reviews about vid games, so here it is. I'm currently playing MW3, BF3, and Batman Arkham City. MW3 is nice, beautiful picture, sharp edges. BF3 is Un- freaking- believable. WOW It feels like a whole new game with this tv. As if they made it just for this tv. Perfect. Now Batman is indescribable, awesome, perfect isn't a good enough word. I started playing it in 2d until I realized my xbox plays 3d games w this tv!!!! I keep it on 3d now. I played for hours and my eyes weren't all goofy. I admitt at first it took a little to get use to but now it is crazy fun. I though the pic would come out of the screen , like the movies, but it goes in!!! It is amazing, when you go on a roof or walk down a hall it gives total perspective of how big the city is, Im hooked. I wak eup in the middle of the night to run down and play games! My wife hates it, but doesn't push the subject:) So if you have a girl who hates your gaming, this might not be for you. Get a plasma:P. 240hz is awesome, no shakey images at all.I did a ton of research before buying this tv and i am 150% happy. I checked out LG's, Samsungs, Sonys, ect. Nothing even came close for the price and features.Also, it doesn't feel cheap, or lightweight crap. It is very well built. You will not be dissappointed.

Great picture! But once in a while TV won't powered on. The VIZIO logo will light up and not the TV. But last night I switched it off and it is dead permanently. Did not last even a year. Only the logo lights up. Called VIZIO. They are replacing it with a re-certified TV M3D470KD. Same spec but 47 inch in place of 42. Hopefully that one is okay. So if you buy VIZIO also buy extended waranty or expect to spend one TV per year!!", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "12 Months and 2 weeks after purchase the TV died", "Author": "Kathryn E.

Called Vizio customer support and they said they won't fix because it is out of warranty.  Looked online and it seems MANY others are having the same problem.If you buy this TV, buy the a multi-year warranty...but better yet...buy a Samsung.  Our other 40in television is a Samsung and it is a year older and it works fine.Vizio...if your customers are having a lot of problems with this same issue, I would think you would do the noble thing and recall the product or at least provide a service credit to those who are having to repair the thing.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stay away!

It worked fine for another 8 months after being repaired and now the board is out again. I talked with Vizio and they said they couldn't do anything but give me a discount on another TV. Now why would I want to buy another one of their TV's? They don't even have a main board in stock to buy.

Couple of months after 1yr warranty period the TV died, no display and no sound. I thought it should be minor problem so spend money and had a TV technician to take a look, he confirmed the main board is not working, unfortunately the main board is not available in the market.

Meyer", "ReviewID": "RSZSA1IK1N5II", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I didn't buy this TV off of amazon but I thought I'd leave a review. I purchased this like most people, as a black friday deal. (An amazing deal at that.) But I should've expected something fishy was up. Had this for a little over a year (Half the time I had it I just had it sitting on the basement not being used. After going to use it again it seemed to work fine. 10 minutes into watching the TV started to have random color lines in it and after a short while all colors are completely odd and random. My year warranty was up but I tried contacting vizio anyways. According to their support (I Sent in pictures) the main board has an issue. They basically told me too bad so sad when I asked them what I was to do about it. They gave me two companies they use to fix TVs. They were no help either. One basically told me I live too far away from any of their repair shops. The other was completely rude. After looking for days upon days I cannot find a new main board for this TV. I found a repair person through eBay but he told me he's not able to fix it and it could actually be a problem with the LCD. Now I'm stuck with a TV that doesn't work. And the way it looks, one that I'm not even able to fix. I had a vizio TV prior to this and I never had any issues, it was actually stolen when my apartment was robbed. Needless to say I do like Vizio TVs for piture quality but when it comes to their support you might as well call someone and ask them to do nothing for you, and be absolutely rude in the process. Now I have an unusable TV and am out hundreds of dollars. Ouch. I'd go with the older and thicker version of vizio TVs as I've never had any problems with them. However, this one needs work. And the parts are impossible to find. Slap in the face.

I have another 32\" Vizio that i bought 3 years ago, and it stills work great. So I'm guessing this specific tv is a problem, and the company as a whole sells ok tv's. That being said, the company will not fix it after the one year warranty expires. Not only will they not fix it, but they are not even slightly helpful. They basically say \"sorry its not our problem\". Vizio should have much better business practices, and support the products they sell. For this reason, I suggest nobody buy another Vizio product.
