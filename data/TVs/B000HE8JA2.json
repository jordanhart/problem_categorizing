I love Amazon.com, that's why the review is also posted here.  When I got mine, I was overjoyed.  You can check out the full review of the FN model at htguys.com, but here's the conclusion:What we liked  * Awesome HD picture  * Amazing black levels  * Great, real color  * Excellent detail  * Two HDMI inputs  * PriceWhat we disliked  * Remote control  * Menu system  * Input switching with the factory remoteConclusionThe JVC HD-61FN97 is an excellent value.  It looks great, does a wonderful job with HD content, a great job with DVDs and a pretty good job with standard definition TV.  Blacks are good, contrast is solid, colors are excellent and detail is vivid.  We try to look for great values to help you (and us for that matter) get a little more out of each hard earned dollar. You'd be hard pressed to find a better looking 61\" TV at its price. It really helps bring the big screen home.", "Date": "June 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Simply THE best regardless of price.", "Author": "conchyjoe \"conchyjoe\"", "ReviewID": "R1E66C8EQ85TB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this display now for about 3 months. Simply put; I could not be happier. The picture is absolutely stunning and flawless. When watching Discovery HD on my DirecTV HD receiver; you are there! At the time of this writing Discovery HD is about 3 weeks into their \"Planet Earth\" series and to see the beauty of this incredible program on this display is quite frankly mind-boggling. Even the sound on the internal speakers which I only use occasionaly is great for internal TV speakers. The blue light on the front that some seem to be a little disturbed about that it could distract them is not distracting to me at all, but if it distracts you, it can be dimmed or turned off completely; so that is not an issue. The fan is as quiet as you're going to get and can only barely be heard with the volume completely down, and the wife and I sit only about 7 1/2 feet away.I was offered a choice at the store where I buy of getting the 60\" Sony, the 61\" Samsung or the 61\" JVC all 1080p displays and all at the exact same price...The JVC was in my opinion the hands down winner in picture quality. That said, I'm sure either of the other 2 displays would also make pretty much anyone happy.In any case, trust me...with this display, and my Parasound pre/pro and amps, Aerial (FL, FR, and center) and Energy (4 rear channels) speakers, 2 15\" DefTech subs all set up in a 7.2 configuration...As my wife now says: The theatres are so inferior. Ya gotta love it!I HIGHLY recommend this display to even the most discerning videophile.", "Date": "April 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "JVC HD61FN97...after very long study", "Author": "Buddyjay", "ReviewID": "R1MKWIAKJ391PG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I finally made a decision on which HDTV to purchase after a lengthy study. Although I am not taking delivery for a few days, I feel I know this tv very well. Also I hope this review can help others who are considering this unit. I was torn between the Sony XBR2, the Samsung 61\" and the JVC. All are 1080p but the Samsung is said to have \"wobulation\" which is not TRUE 1080p so... I finally decided to purchase the Sony, ($3000) based on all the great reviews this tv had. I also am a believer in the LCOS technology over DLP. Anyway, I couldn't get the JVC out of my mind. Everytime I went to Best Buy to research tv's I kept seeing the unbelievable picture on the JVC. The Sony, no matter what store, never had a great \"out of the box\" picture, like the JVC. And no, the JVC hadn't been tweaked. When I saw the price included a $300 stand, it was just to financially a plus not to get the JVC. Technically a $1300 differance. I know many will say that the Sony is better but I couldn't deny the fantastic picture I saw at the store. I just can't justify spending $1300 more for the Sony. I'd rather have the extra money for maybe an HD-DVD player. After I take delivery, I will comment on the tv after about a month.", "Date": "January 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pleasure to Watch", "Author": "Bobby", "ReviewID": "RVBJEUVUEWHFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took me months before I made up my mind about a TV, it was a hard decision to go with LCD, Plasma or Rear Projection. They all looked great but everyone has their own opinion it seemed, but since I wasn't going to hang the TV, I saw no reason to spend the extra, plus the reflection off the other screens would have been too much I thought, and I was 100% right about the choice. Unfortunately I only had this TV For two months before it was stolen while I was on vacation! But it sure was a pleasure to have and I watched many movies on it and they were all great and looked better than  movie theater screens....except some with a lot of motion, at times the TV did not process as quick and delay was there but that's with almost all the Rear Projections (even some Plasma) TVs I have seen so far too.It's a True 1080P and it will be even better once that is implemented but for the price and the look you get, there is no better TV in the market at this time. I am just sorry it was stolen, but I am buying the SAME TV, which should tell you how good it is when you have an option to change your mind after two months. The Stand that I got was also great look with the TV so I am looking at the stand and keep hoping it will be here soon again so I can start ordering my DVDs!", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good picture but doesn't stand the test of time.", "Author": "Click", "ReviewID": "R1BTC7CKU5H8YU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When new the image is great on these.  The bulbs last 2-3 years if you get a quality phillips bulb, off brands are junk.  But after a few years all these LCD projection type TV's, including Sony SXRD, JVC HDILA etc.  have optical block issues which starts as yellow or greenish tint spots and slowly spreads to the entire image.  The only fix is to replace the optical block unit which is more expensive than a new 60\" TV.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Superb television - sound quality and display projection!!", "Author": "K. Monroe \"JauggernautX\"", "ReviewID": "R13HX3XVVAVZ8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this television for about two years give or take a couple of months and it's still running strong. The only issue I'm currently having is that the color is starting to show a hint of greenish tint while watching certain programs. I've adjusted the color settings as well as purchased a HDTV Calibration DVD in order to correct the issue but it still persists. My next plan is to perhaps locate a individual or company that can personally calibrate the television for me. Another option might be for me to have the color wheel checked out and/or replaced depending on what is found.Overall though I'm thoroughly impressed with this purchase. It was purchased overseas at the base PX at a steal of a price.

It was a great purchase, excellent picture that most people who saw it did not think it was a rear projection.  No flaws what so ever.In 2010 I wanted to upgrade(so I thought) to a larger HDTV with 3D capability, so I purchased a 65 inch Mitsubishi---what the &%ck?  I now have 3D but he JVC picture quality makes the Mitsubishi look as if I had rabbit ears connected for the HD signal.  The Mitsubishi refresh rate sucks.Unfortunately I gave the JVC to my son the day the Mitsubishi arrived and don't want to ruin his HD experience that he seems to be enjoying.If you have or can get your hands on the JVC HDILA-go for it, you won't regret it.I should have held onto mine(JVC) for at least 1 week before I gave it away.This makes me sad.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "We Love the JVC 61\" HDILA TV!", "Author": "Amazon1 Member", "ReviewID": "R6RYRYO2F2IIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife was ready to buy a year before I was. But I kept reviewing, researching, wandering the stores, comparing. It just looked like the best picture out there in that size for the money. We finally bought it in September 2006.
