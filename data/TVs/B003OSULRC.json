{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Well performing budget t.v.", "Author": "Aj", "ReviewID": "RHO52CJ497DXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This 32\" Dynex HDTV has been a great performer and makes for a perfect television for a small/medium sized room.  The picture clarity is impressive and there has been no blur/ghosting or artifacts while watching television, watching movies, or playing console games.  The picture is bright with good contrast (can change these settings in the menu if needed), and black appears black.  It also has good viewing angles, as compared to a similar sized (and more expensive) Samsung tv that you have to practically sit in front of to get a clear picture.  As with most LCD tv's the sound is average and acceptable, however you'll want to hook it up to your stereo system to get good quality sound.The only annoyance was taking it out of the box and having to screw the base to the t.v. (no screwdriver needed, they are hand screws).  The setup was easy, and the remote is user friendly.  It comes with component and audio cables, and of course batteries for the remote.  The extra HDMI and audio/video/headset ports on the side come in handy.  As with any brand there's always bad apples in the bunch, this review is based on a unit that was thankfully perfect out of the box.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the t.v. base doesn't swivel, a minor thing but if you are used to a swivel base that could get annoying.  It can be scary to purchase an off-brand name, but this is one case where buying a budget t.v. ended on a good note.  If you want to save even more money, buy a set of rabbit ears to plug into this t.v. and enjoy the free HD stations in your area.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV for the price, but...", "Author": "L. Pierce", "ReviewID": "RRB6HPPXQ1HSK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this TV during Black Friday, and it's been amazing so far. The picture and sound quality are sublime, but just recently I've started seeing giant flickering vertical lines down the sides. It was subtle at first, but as time is going on they're getting more and more prominent. I've had Dynex in the past, and it worked very well, but considering that my new one is less than four months old, I'm not a fan.

I couldn't beat the price so I figured why not give it a try. I can't speak for other sizes but the 32\" size, 720p picture is bright and clear with great color. I don't notice any difference between the pictures of this tv and the Samsung tv in my bedroom. My living room is small (about 10 X 14') and I set it up angled into a corner. The view is great from all over the room with no distortion in the side view. No problems at all with wii, netflix, or dvd connections. As other reviewers have mentioned, the sound is low quality. It's very hollow and tinny sounding. Luckily I already had a little Insignia shelf stereo system that I'm able to hook up to this tv using the auxiliary function of the stereo. Otherwise, I'm not sure if I would have been able to get used to the hollow sounding tv speakers. Bottom line, good bargain if you already have a sound system to use in lieu of this tv's factory installed speakers. Other than that, you either have to live with the sound or factor in the cost of an alternative speaker. At $249, I've already gotten two years of use from this tv and expect a few more.

I think it's a fair TV for the price. The picture is decent, but doesn't completely compare with the higher-end models in terms of color and clarity. I think the placement of the HDMI cable is somewhat awkward. We have our television mounted on the wall, and it is very difficult to access the HDMI port on our model. I wish it was located on the side like our component and video cables are.If you're looking for a decent basic HDTV without all of the expensive bells and whistles, this one can certainly get the job done.

Then the 2009 one stopped responding to older remote and is iffy with its own remote. Hence my opinion that durability is questionable.

The TV tuner doesn't pick up all the channels my old tv did, if you're navigating the menu options, it will randomly kick you out and then the sound won't work unless you turn it off and on again. If you do manage to pick up some channels, but then try to tune in on it again when the signal isn't as good, it just deletes the channel so you can't tune into it again unless you do another channel scan.

I thought that considering its low price, this would be a mediocre unit at best but I was pleasantly surprised.  The image is absolutely fantastic and has all the features of a higher priced flat screen TV.  While it is only a 720 model, this is not a problem in the 32\" size (as a matter of fact, they say 1080s can look over pixelated on a 32\"screen).  I am very, very pleased with this TV.  The only drawback is that the sound is a little tinny.  The addition of a sound bar would make this a perfect 10!  This was an entry-level flat screen for me which I have placed in my bedroom.  It is really a wonderful television and I highly recommend it for anyone.  As a starter model, if it was a car, it would be like having an AUDI or a BMW for your first vehicle!

Terrible experience!", "Author": "BigDog85", "ReviewID": "R1AZ5054GVV9ZE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my first time ever writing a product review on any website. PLEASE do yourself a favor and AVOID this product, and Dynex products, at all costs.I bought this television for my parents for this past Christmas. On April 15th -- less than FOUR MONTHS after purchase -- they called to tell me the TV wasn't receiving power. I bought a 2-yr warranty (from Best Buy), and for anything 32 inches or larger they offer home visits to fix the product. Except that's for ALL OTHER BRANDS except Dynex (for them, it's 37 inches or larger). So instead, my parents had to drive the TV to a Best Buy an hour away, and Dynex's turnaround time on getting it fixed is TWO WEEKS.Honestly, I'm completely blown away by this entire experience. It's amazing to me that a brand new TV could break so soon after purchase. it speaks to the miserable quality and attention to detail that Dynex puts into their products. Plus I feel terrible for my parents who have to deal with fixing something I bought them as a gift.So my personal recommendation: Avoid the risk/ and headache of the above happening to you, spend an extra $50-$75 and get a different brand TV.
