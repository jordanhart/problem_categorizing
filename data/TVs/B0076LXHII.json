So far this has been an excellent choice.  I decided to go with dumb Plasma 720 over a Smart 1080 LED.  Saved a bundle and paired it with a nice Blu-Ray player with tons of apps.  Picture quality is great and sound was a pleasant surprise.  You have to change the sound settings out of the box, and then you are ready to roll.  I ordered a surround sound to go with this but am contemplating sending that back.Salesman will always tell you to go with 1080 LED, LCD or even 3D for Blu-Ray. A couple of comments on that.  LCD and LED LCD do not have the glare issues that Plasma has and that is no different here.  After that, Plasma has far truer color accuracy and much better blacks.  The refresh rate is far superior on Plasmas.  Also, when comparing a 720 to a 1080, most people cannot distinguish between the two after 10-12 feet.  With a 51\" you need to be at that distance to enjoy it. If you want 3D consider this.  Content is extremely limited to mostly kids movies and bad adult ones. Blockbuster, Redbox and Netflix offer NO 3D Blu-Ray rentals as of today.  VUDU is the only online vendor that streams 3D and that will break your bank.I'm not being critical of LCD's here.  I own a wonderful LG 3D smart TV and I love it. If your looking for a good TV without emptying out your wallet consider a 720 plasma.  No bells and whistles, but do you really need Netflix or Youtube on 10 devices in your house?Overall does what a TV should do very well and very large. Easy to setup, great picture and sound.  Only con to this product is very limited connectivity.  Only has two HDMI on the rear and 1 optical digital audio output.  You will not be able to use HDMI pass through on this television.  No ARC on the HDMI.Just make sure you have a dark area and you will enjoy. 5 stars for just being a good tv.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great quality picture, easy set up, Plasma's back!", "Author": "A \"A\"", "ReviewID": "R1N6CZW9GA3MXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time comparing LCD, LED and Plasma and decided on the Plasma.  They've done a good job overcoming some of their previous problems.  I'm so glad I made this choice.This is the \"E\", 2012 version of the \"D\" from 2011, which has gotten very good reviews.The picture is crisp, colors are vibrant, black is so BLACK!  The on-screen set up is easy, the menu system is simple and just about anyone can figure it out without much help from the directions.  The commands are logical and the options for sound and picture dynamics work well for HD, digital or standard cable incoming signals, which is great since we get all three in our area.  Don't be dissuaded by the 720p; it give great picture quality.  We had a 1080p and at this size (51\") we see no difference, it's a non-issue.  Several people have said that in on-line reviews and  they are right, I'm glad we listened to them.The only minor issue is the shiny screen; if a lamp is on in the room you may see it reflected in the screen.  But we watch TV with the lights off so it's not a problem at all.The weight is less than 50 lb. making it easy to set up.  It comes with a plastic stand that seems flimsy as you put it together but it's not, and it's perfectly capable of holding the television securely and looks great once assembled with a Phillips head screwdriver and the 8 screws that come with it.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Good All Around Plasma with some Minor to Significant Flaws", "Author": "S. Morales", "ReviewID": "R11DQP4HQBRZ1S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Samsung 43\" plasma features some good basic features while performing very adequately in terms of picture and sound quality. All around it is a top choice for the person who wants a very affordable plasma television with the essential features, but may not do so well for the person who desires a much deeper level of choice in terms of connection options and has a bit more money to spend.The positives for this plasma tv are that well, it's a plasma. These days LCD and LED flat panels have mostly overtaken the tv market, promising a brighter and smoother picture through their diode lighting and all the benefits of your quality plasma television. Though most of their claims are true, the simple fact is that the hardware of a plasma tv will always trump that of either an LCD or an LED. The blacks are MUCH truer and deeper on plasmas than anywhere else, and even in a decently well-lit room, a plasma can still perform well, so forget lots of that jargon saying that if you have a room with ANY sort of light coming in that a plasma will look absolutely horrid. Simply not true and very overaly exaggerated. Yes, while an LED and LCD would look somewhat brighter, this plasma in particular does have a significantly bright screen that would do well in a room with 1 or 2 windows letting light inside. Another reason the plasma hardware works better is that unlike many LED's, the picture frame rate is the truest standard for movies. Many LED implement a frame rate smoothing that even if turned off, still leaves a little bit of an ungenuine \"soap opera\" look to your favorite movies and tv shows. It's just the way the hardware is, no way around it; meanwhile, LCD's being the most affordable, have perhaps the worst of all black levels, and colors that can tend to appear too stale. Hence if you had to pick from the three, plasma is really the way to go. Anyway, this Samsung performs well in terms of picture, although not PERFECT.Next, the sound quality I appreciated most. This tv has a significant boost in fullness of volume over previous models. You'll notice that the tv is fairly audible even at the volume set to 1, and watching comfortably you can put it up to 7 to 10. Previous Samsung tv's had some terrible volume levels, whereas some smaller older models having to be turned up to about 60 when watching a Blu-ray movie, and even worse for DVDs! So thankfully Samsung has greatly remedied these issues with their current tv's, and this television does an exceptional job for a thin flat panel in terms of sound. Things don't sound tinny at all, and having this tv in a bedroom I would see no reason for any type of soundbars if you just want to get some good basic sound out of the unit.The tv also has 2 HDMI inputs, 1 component input, and a USB connection.The tv is also very light, and one adult can fairly easily lift  the unit from one place to another without a problem.This tv is also pretty energy efficient, so you'll save some good money on your energy bill as this one has an estimated $17/year price on consumption; good for plasmas, as they have a tendency to suck the most juice between them and LCD and LED's.The flaws are there, and noticeable, but minor depending on how much you expect to do with this television.Now in terms of picture and sound quality, I see NO reason to gripe for either; considering those are the most important aspects of a television, the quality will seal the deal for many buyers just with that.I used to own a 2010 model 450 series plasma, which although significantly heavier had MUCH better connection options. It also had a swivel stand which this tv doesn't. While that may not sound like a big deal, the swivel stand was a huge convenience. The reasoning for removing it was obviously to lessen the weight as well as production costs.Onto the connection options... like I said, my older 2010 model was a better tv overall. Not only did it have a slightly sharper picture, but I could also do more with it (granted, I do prefer the sound quality of this newer model). The older tv had a cable box, PS3, PS2, and Gamecube hooked up. the PS2 and Gamecube both used component cables, and considering my older model had 2 component connections, they were both hooked up no problem. the PS3 and cable box used 2 of the 3 HDMI's that were available. The older unit also had 2 composite connections, whereas this new unit has NONE. So what you really have here is a measly 2 HDMI connections, one component connection and an option for USB. I had to purchase a separate component switcher in order for all of my units to function on the tv... but would have greatly preferred to have it all to the tv directly as to not compromise any sort of sound or video quality whatsoever. In this case, I'll have to.Other may also not like the lighter and \"cheaper\" feel of the tv. You can tell lots was cut from this unit due to production costs, and although the older unit was heavier, it felt sturdier and like it would last years beyond however long this unit lasts. TV's are definitely not made how they used to be, but hopefully this unit stands the test of time because I still don't know the overall quality of the hardware and its lasting power just yet. I'll edit this review if anything goes wrong.*EDIT*The very same night that I wrote this review (and only about 3 days of owning the tv) I noticed in the upper right corner area there are 2 dead and still pixels, one black and the other green. Dead pixels are nothing new to tvs, and I really don't notice this one at all if I'm watching from a reasonable distance (like 6 to 9 feet away), but up close at about 4 feet away I do notice it if there is a white or light colored image on the screen. May not seem like a big deal but a dead pixel is a dead pixel. I'm going over to Best Buy tomorrow and purchasing their 4-year Geeksquad extended plan, because I've had the Geeksquad over my house for another tv and they do good work. If in a couple of years the tv goes bad overall, they even replace it with another similar unit. Or I can pay to upgrade. I'd rather do this than call Samsung because then they'll just send over a third-party company who will probably do a hack job. I trust the Geeksquad.Someone also commented below about overheating or heat release. There is no significant heal release from this unit whatsoever. Heat release is something of the past with flat-panels. I used to own a 42\" Panasonic plasma (actually, I still have it and it works great, just in another room of the house), and it was pretty bulky considering I got it about 5 to 6 years ago. It has very significant heat release and is downright uncomfortable to watch in an enclosed room in the summer time, and I even used to use it as a little heater during the winter!It is also important to note that there is NO internet or wi-fi capabilities on this unit at all. This is just your standard tv for a good price that performs well.So why did I get rid of my older plasma even though I preferred it a bit more? It had a burn-in issue from watching too many standard definition tv shows. This newer plasma perhaps won't burn-in so easily considering the updated hardware, but at least I know to take care of it.All picture, sound and burn-in protection options on the tv itself are the same as Samsung's older models (same standard, movie, voice, amplify options for sound and standard, movie and dynamic options for picture, as well as the options to customize these).For the casual buyer on a budget this really is a no-brainer, also those who intend on using this tv for a bedroom or single room, and they'll be perfectly happy. For the most hardcore enthusiest and/or gamer type, I would strongly suggestion finding another model with more picture and connection options. Although these days it's hard to find a tv with the amount of connection options of the past.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love it...But keep this in mind before you buy!", "Author": "masa1607", "ReviewID": "RZDJGDF2SX0MM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV it worth every penny, it has a beautiful picture, the sound is amazing(no sound bar needed trust me), amazing color! After I purchaced the set I went down to hhgreg and compared the 1080p version to the 720p version an honestly I could hardly tell the difference! The difference was that a football game was on and the small bar at the bottom that showed the team and the score was slightly car crisper on 1080p, but I need to ask is it worth a hundred more dollars?  My wife and I generally use this for watching our roku box 720p, it looks amazing! All and all we love this TV, we were stuck between this and a scepter 50\", but we have long loved Samsung tv's and got it for an amazing price so it was a no brainer! The picture has no blur, and none if that soap opera effect I hate. It has no frills its just a plain TV, I feel 3D, internet, smart TV blah blah feels gimmicky!  But here are the down sides, its a plasma so it does get some image pretension but its not bad and fades quickly. And here is the big kicker! When plasma's first came out there was a gap between the plasma screen and the outer screen, how ever that gap was removed to reduce reflection and to make them thinner. However plasma's put off heat this causes thermal expansion, the molecules speed apart inside the unit swelling the whole TV a very small amount. Now that there is no gap in the screen Samsung plasma's have been suffering from internal cracks on the plasma screen its self! The swelling forces the two screens so close together that the very hard outer glass cracks the week inner plasma screen. This is not covered by samsung, and if it happens to you, you will be denid by there warranty department! Google Samsung internal crack, and you will find thousands of people who are out a lot of money and a TV!  The good news, as far as my research could tell the units that were hit by this were the 2010,2011 units a lot of D models. As far as I could tell no one has suffered from this with any of this years E models.. To make sure of this I called Samsung they were apsolutly useless, I called best buy they sell this and many other Samsung TV's' and hhgreg, hhgreg said they sell a lot of this TV and have not had this problem, best buy said they have not heard of this problem either! So as far as I can tell there units are not effected.. It does scare me though! Me and my wife got this for each other for our 6 year anniversary and we both love it, but we our light on funds and big purchases come few and far in between in our family, so the thought of being out all that money is beyond scary!But this TV stays pretty cool for a plasma, so that plus my research comforts me  Why did I write this review? It probably looks like I both love and hate this TV, NO I love this TV and we wouldn't trade it.. I wrote it for two reasons, 1. I believe that the consumer should know what there buying and the risks that could come along with it ie if your TV starts blinking, shutting its self off, getting streaks, shut it off don't turn it back on, call Samsung and tell them what's happening don't turn it back on! 2. For those who have already read reviews and did research on samsungs internal crack problem, don't necessarily count this TV out as my research shows Samsung may have fixed the problem! And ALL reviews for this TV that say internal cracks are intact not for this TV but a similar one from the year before! In other words buy it love it but be aware!", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Superb TV for the Price", "Author": "Savvas", "ReviewID": "R128O3I7IDTN8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this television the Saturday after Black Friday from Best Buy for $379.99 (about $413 including tax).  It has replaced my 4 year old 32\" Insignia LCD screen in my bedroom and it is an obvious step up.  Black levels are superb, as should be expected from any plasma TV.  Picture quality while watching HD programming is amazing.  Watching football games is an absolute thrill with this TV.  There really isn't any motion blur to complain about.  The source of the signal does seem to matter.  For example games airing on ESPN and CBS look better than those airing on FOX.Compared to my other 51\" Samsung plasma everything is pretty close in terms of black levels and clarity, the biggest difference I see is in terms of color.  The 51\" plasma does offer a richer picture in terms of color density, but then again that TV was double the price of this one.Audio is pretty solid.  With the cable volume set to max, I usually have the TV volume set around 17 or 18 and that's plenty loud for me.The lack of inputs don't bother me as I knew of this before purchasing it and at the moment I only have my cable box and Xbox 360 (via HDMI) connected to it.  The USB input is pretty neat as I have about 800GB of TV shows and movies on an external hardrive that I can now easily access and watch.Overall given the price I paid for the television, this is an excellent television with great picture clarity and amazing black levels.My biggest suggestion for those looking to buy this TV (or any TV for that matter) is to play around with the picture settings and even Google picture (or calibration) settings in order to get the picture you want.

No humming noise, which was a problem on older plasmas, and it also feel lighter and even thinner than the LED we had bought. If you are going to go for a cheap TV plasma is definitely much better than LED still. Perhaps the very best LED TVs can have pictures comparable to this one, but then you are talking completely different prices.I have a roku so no need for the smart features of their more expensive lineup, and 720p works great for mainly simple TV viewing and streaming.All in all very pleasantly surprised by this set.

HD content (from my PS3/Netflix) look great and this being a Plasma TV, it's great for gaming, too. However, what keeps me from giving the TV 5 stars is the lack of many, essential, needed connections. At the time of purchase, information on this TV was lacking as it's a new model for 2012. So I was very disappointed to find out that the TV comes with only 2 HDMI, one Component, one EX-Link, one Digital Audio Out (Optical), and a USB. The TV not only lacks extra HDMI connections, but it also lacks a headphone jack input! What am I to do if I want to watch TV using a headphone? I'd either have to buy really expensive audio receiver and cables, or just do without the headphone input. How stupid is that?! Anyway, the lack of an Audio Out almost pushes me to return the TV. But I may end up keeping it because the picture quality is so great and because it didn't break my bank to get this 51-inch Plasma.UPDATE: To fix the headphone problem, I had to buy the following: An Optical Audio Cable, an RCA to headphone cable, and a Digital to Analog converter. The problem is now sort of fixed as I can use my headphones now. However, I'm still unable to control the volume (it's always at the same volume), and I don't really want to spend more money on more expensive equipment.

There are an infinite amount of adjustments and settings available(which I'm sure all modern TV's possess), so you can tailor it just to your liking and to your different input devices. I think it's just a knockout. The blacks are deep, the colors are vibrant, and there's great brightness and contrast control to set it specifically for your lighting conditions, which is really nice.I generally watch this TV about 8-9 feet away, and for me any closer gets a bit over whelming. IMO the 43\" size is about right for my space.Glare: I would not let reviews about reflection dissuade you from a great TV for a great price. Since I've been watching a CRT my entire life, maybe I'm just used to a certain amount of glare, but it does not annoy or distract me one bit. I certainly don't feel like it's especially bad with this Samsung. I view this TV in an open plan living room/kitchen/dining space about 25' by 25'. There are three pairs of double hung windows in this room along with a full length glass door. They are all shaded, and on the windows I have particularly effective white, polyester shades that reach over to the molding so there is no direct light leaking through... but it is a well lit, but well diffused, room in the daytime.Viewing angle: There is no viewing angle on this TV. You can literally stand to the side of it and watch... this combined with the 43\" size allows me to sit at my kitchen table, kitty-corner across the room(22-23' away) and have the ability to comfortably watch programming.Sound: I think the sound is good... doesn't strike me as \"tinny\" at all. Some older documentary programing I may have to crank up the volume to near 40(I believe it goes to 100), but on some newer movies and I can have it just above 10. Also would add that the half dozen or so volume categories(clear voice, movie, etc.) really seem to work well for me and are pretty handy, but I assume this is a common feature with flat screens these days.Odds n ends:I set this TV up by myself, not really heavy or difficult to move around, so that's a plus.I've read some reviews about loud buzzing, something that my example does not display, when you're face is up close to the screen, wiping down the frame or whatnot, there is a faint buzz, but not noticeable when viewing programming.I've read that Plasmas are prone to giving off lots of heat, but I believe I read this particular model has some new technology that allows it to run without giving off much heat, and I can confirm it doesn't really at all.The frame is beautiful. A glossy piano black finish. Can be frustrating to neat-freaks I guess since it shows all dust, but does look great.Dislikes: The remote is small and slick. It's rounded on the bottom and at the back so it squirts out of hand once in a while. I would have preferred even a large brick over this design... I think Samsung could have done better.Two HDMI plugs are not enough. I'm no techy, I don't do video games and stuff but if you've got a blue-ray player and say, another all region DVD player, you're already full. Probably not a big deal to expand it, but just an annoyance.I'm really glad I'm so cheap and did a fair bit of research. Plasma is something I hadn't considered because of all the negatives I'd heard in the past, but I've been waiting for a good, name-brand 42\" flat screen to come in under $400... just wasn't happening.Because of good pricing I started researching plasma... it turns out that there are a lot of myths from the past associated with this mature technology, and they are in fact superior in may ways to the latest LED/LCD displays.

Making content, not TV's, but as such, I stare at very high end monitors all day. So I am a bit picky about picture quality.  That being said, I am also the sole provider for a family of 7.  I can not, I will not spend thousands of dollars for a television. So I was a bit skeptical when I started looking for a 40-55\" TV at around a 500 dollar budget. I honestly didn't think I would find a set that would meet my very high standards.After doing research for about a week it came down to two sets.  The Samsung 51\" plasma and a Panasonic 50\" plasma.  Both are on sale at Best Buy for $499. They are both almost identical and I don't think you can go wrong with either one, but I ended up going with Samsung as they seem to be the hot brand right now and it is an extra inch bigger.Onto the review...The single most important thing in a televisions image quality is contrast ratio. The difference between the brightest and darkest part of the image. A quality high contast image looks dimensional and alive, while a low contrast image looks almost flat or 2D.  By virtue of the Samsung being a plasma, it has a very high contrast ratio and as such looks amazing.  I will let you in on a little secret...plasmas are better that LCD TV's.  There I said it...now come strike me down and smite me, but that is my opinion.  Why is a plasma better in my opinion? They have better contrast ratio. They have a better viewing angle, and most importnat to me...motion blur and they way plasmas handle motion. Sports and video games just look better to me on a plasma.Also, because this set is 720P it is cheaper than a 1080I set, does that make 1080I better? It sounds like it should, but it isn't.  I would rather look at 720 progressive frames (720 frames per second) that 1080 interlaced frames (540 frames per second) . Doesnt that make sense?Anyway, the picture quality, color reproduction, sharp image, and amazingly low price make this Samsung a sure thing.  After getting it home, I was trying to find a reason it was so cheap...maybe the audio and speakers would be bad, nope they were great.Maybe the brightness would be too low...nope, You have three settings, Standard, if the room is very dark and Movie and Dynamic for brighter conditions...and both the Movie and Dynamic setting are well beyond bright enough for even the brightest conditions in my living room with huge picture windows.The only thing that I can say about this TV that isnt good is, although there are plenty for me,  it could have more inputs on the back of the set...but at $499 come on...something had to give.It is a solid TV with a beautiful image, decent sound, excellent viewing angle, handles sports and game motion beautifully, and although some have said the style of the TV itself is plain, I would prefer to call it timeless and classic.At $499.00, for this Samsung 51\" plasma, right now, it has to be the best TV money can buy...in the world.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "TV Eye \"52\"", "ReviewID": "RUBLRMC5WBF65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great picture for a great price.

I really admire the extended features built in to the TV including the GAME MODE which is an absolute essential for anyone doing anything online gaming related.The TV stand itself does not provide any sort of swivel factor however and the tv sits slightly angled upward, unfortunately I have not personally found a way to alter this design without making the stand sound like its going to snap under pressure, it provides no hampered visuals for my girlfriend and I but does leave something to be desired.Angled viewing is absolutely fantastic and the clarity from the TV is superb from practically any angle, the settings might be a bit off at first but after adjusting the TV you will definitely be glad you purchased a \"dumb\" plasma over one of the newer fancier TVs out there.This is your basic TV and includes all the essential ports you would need prior to a full complete home theater system. The sound is spectacular and the bass from the TV alone is more than sufficient, I actually got rid of my old sound system because this TV sounded 100x better, granted they weren't tall boys or anything but it was a few years old and I had honestly expected to get more life out of them.Gaming on the Xbox 360 is fantastic and this TV truly shines with any sort of games and this TV does not produce the dreaded \"Soap Opera\" effect, nor does it need it as any sort of image enhancement is not required with the 600hz display.The only issue I truly have with this TV is the material and coating used to cover the display, it reflects everything like a mirror and the top right corner constantly has an image of our ceiling fan and lamp that consistently over powers any sort of image put on the screen, with that turned off however the visual quality on this TV is a dream.Lastly I have noticed some high latency between the remote and the TV, I assumed it was the batteries however a quick swap proved no results, so I just assume that this TV is not one of the faster TV's out there but after 3 - 4 weeks of getting used to the remote I have learned to compensate and be patient while it does its thing.We picked ours up at 400$ at walmart on clearance and have been happy ever since.**MY SETTINGS**Mode: StandardCell Light: 15Contrast: 100Brightness: 40Sharpness: 50Color: 50TINT (G/R): G50/R50Color Space: NativeWHITE BALANCE: R/G/B Offset/Gain all 25Gamma: 0Dynamic Contrast: LowBlack Tone: OffFlesh Tone: 0Motion Lighting: OffColor Tone: StandardSize: 16:9Digital Noise Filter: HighHDMI Black Level: LowFilm Mode: AutoPros:True 43 inch700hz Crisp displayGame ModeMultiple options to adjust visual and audio settingsHeavy Bass for a 43 inch TVCons:Non adjustable standCrazy screen glare in bright lit roomremote lags quite a bitpretty heavy for a 43\"", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value, good picture, ugly glare", "Author": "Ben Agata \"Ben Agata\"", "ReviewID": "R165777B9M5AST", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my Samsung 51\" plasma for a full weekend now, and I am very impressed with the television. I bought this tv on sale at Fry's for $449, which is a great deal for a name brand TV at this size. The main competitors to Samsung in this price range are LG and Panasonic. I think it is important to note that it is hard to compare these TV's, unless you have them all hooked up in your living room. Room lighting and picture calibration can make a big difference between a screen that looks impressive, versus one that is washed out or dark. I suggest the calibration settings posted on CNet as a good baseline for where to start with calibrating this TV.The design of this TV is very understated, a glossy black finish all around, relatively thin profile, and a sturdy base. Picture quality is everything I expected, very clear and crisp, warm colors, deep blacks. The screen is easy on the eyes, easy to watch for hours. I have watched live sports, movies, and played video games, and it has performed well under all conditions. All and all a big upgrade from the 37\" Vizio I am upgrading from.There is one major downside to this TV, and it has been touched upon by others, which is the highly reflective glossy screen. The screen is mirror like, and any ambient light will cause glare. If you are putting this screen in a room with no windows, you won't have a problem, but if you are, then the TV is almost unwatchable during the day time. I put the TV in my living room, and the blinds from the adjacent window caused irritating glare. I have a simple solution that has fixed most of the problem. I bought $25 worth of blackout curtains from Target, put them in front of the blinds, and it did the trick. The TV performs best in a complete dark room, perfect for watching a movie on the couch at night. The only other option beside making your room dark would be to buy a Viewguard anti glare film to apply to the screen. For the screen of this size, it would have costed me $160 to buy one of these films, which would have defeated the purpose of getting this tv at such a good price in the first place.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than expected", "Author": "Scot in Paradise", "ReviewID": "R2S83HBMFHQEWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought from local BB retail store for under $500 with free shipping to my home.

Very simple to set up and not filled with excessive bells and whistles (no 3D, internet apps, etc.), this was the best choice for them.  Yes, there is a screen door effect if you are right up on the TV but as I understand, this is typical in most any 768p Plasma set.  But from 4 feet or more away, there is no issue.  The seating positions in my parents' home are all 7 or more feet away and the picture is razor sharp.The menu is pretty straightforward but the button layout on the remote is not intuitive at all.  The return, enter, and menu buttons are all in a sort of odd position, at least in my opinion.  But once I got the hang of the button placement, navigating the menus wasn't difficult.  Setting the source inputs was easy as was adjusting audio and video settings.The default video settings seemed to have a red push.  Some quick and dirty \"calibrations\" brought the TV into a very clear and nice picture.  At some point, I'll take my WOW (World of Wonder) calibration Blu-ray disc over and do some finer tuning but for the time being, it wasn't hard to get a very acceptable picture.Aside from the odd layout of the menu navigation buttons, the rest of the remote had nice, big buttons that should be easy for any age.  The remote also has a backlight feature but I didn't look quite bright enough to be useful except in the darkest of rooms.  Since my parents use TWC and have a set top box, they won't be using the remote on a regular basis.  (Programming the TWC remote to control the Samsung was also quite easy).For a comparison, my parents were upgrading from a Sony XBR 34\" CRT HD set which, while great in its day (2006), was showing some age and also weighs ~240lbs.  They were simply amazed at the color, sharpness, and clarity of the Samsung E450.  And not a lot impresses my parents.Some folks who are looking for the latest technology (3D, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Pandora, etc.) may want to opt for a higher-end model but those that are interested in a simple, yet good performing set, should seriously consider this Samsung.

Went down to $369 after using the rewards points i had with Amazon VISA card. Delivered to my house via CEVA delivery service w/o any problem. I must say that the pic quality of this TV has more color and more crisp than my LN55C630. I bought this mainly for the basement so plasma is a perfect choice. You would need the TV calibration from CNET.com(google PN43E450 TV Calibration) cause pic quality does not look good when plugged for the first time. The only thing that this TV did not do well was when i used the USB to watch AVI movies. From the manual, it does say that it reads AVI, but it freezes all the time. Not like my LN55c630 which i always use to watch AVI movies via USB. Would still need to test this with DVD and Blu-ray.I took out 1 star because of the problem with watching AVI movies. But would i still keep this despite the USB flaw? Yes, for the price i paid, great pic quality, and perfect for my basement, this one is still a keeper and will be mounting this on the wall soon.9/18/13 Update on TV.  Like I said, I have two TVs but I always find myself using this than my LN55C630 which is a bigger TV because of the picture quality is just better! No side angle viewing issue and no burn in issue.

Also I like that it was already broke in for the first 100 hrs!After I got home I loved how thin and light this plasma is and one person can move simply move it!Picture qualityFactory settings are okay but with a few tweaks can be like night and day! I just looked up some calibration settings online and after there set I begin to tweak more to my taste! I was shocked how great the picture is!The blacks are so dark that the bezel blends right in! Also has a pretty bright display for being plasma and also not that bad on reflections even during the day! The picture quality comes pretty close to the G10 but hey its 1080 vs 720 and the blacks are close to one another but the Panny has more shades of black it seems and more detail! Samsungs blacks are real inky but lack the sheer detail!Burn InNow I baby my Panny but between me and my kids we totally abuse this plasma! It has been left on for days on end and even overnight with menu screens from bluray player or game systems on and the picture looks as good as day one! No burn in and not even ghost images after gaming for hours on end! I never used the image retention scroll once!The only thing I hate is the remote!It has pretty good sound for being a flat panel!Real thin bezel is a plus!Love how Anyet+ when u turn off Tv all HDMI connected devices turn off and that's a plus with sleep mode!But really when it comes down to it ..sure there are better TVs out there for far more money but if you want a great picture and great features your can't go wrong with this Samsung for around $400 this can't be beat!

Plug them into the side and ensure the TV can play everything you need i.e. all the necessary file formats you use AVI, MP4, MTS, MKV, MPG etc...Why? Because once you buy, the TV is fixed forever, and it can only ever play what's been encoded in the hardware which can't be updated ever. For the technically minded, the Codecs are in hardware, not software! This is a shame as even open source Video Players from 2011 (VLC) can play every video format that this TV cannot!So if you want your TV to play future formats or a wider range of formats you have to pay Samsung a premium to get hold of an 'Evolution Kit'. This is basically an upgrade service and it only applies to select models so be warned. But of course, this isn't what Samsung's reps will tell you during the in-store demo. Instead they'll pretend a firmware update will address this. So be wary buying a TV thinking its future proof, no matter what the rep says, do your own research as only some select and expensive SMART TV's have this EK upgrade option!============================================================================================Update 2014:TV crashes when an External Drive is connected. The onboard software isn't capable of browsing even a 1TB hard-drive. It just can't handle the files. When it does its painfully slow to scroll through more than just a few files.So basically you need to connect a netbook if you want practical photo / video browsing 'Smart TV'. On the flipside, the Samsung isn't a Smart-TV made by LG which spies on the files you watch.=====================================================Be careful, buying a TV at the moment is like buying a PC and there are serious gotchas...---------------------------------------------------------------SUMMARY:I gave this Samsung 2 Stars instead of the 4 it deserves! Why? Because Samsung are refusing to make the FULL-HD 1080P model (PN51E530) available in my region. Instead the Samsung reps are steering customers to more pricey LED TV's with 3D or SMART TV! For reasons stated below, this isn't a good thing. Its similar to how PC manufacturers are pushing customers into buying overpriced Windows 8 Ultrabooks, when cheaper Windows 7 / XP Netbooks will suffice.My advice is hold out for the 1080P model. I wanted Full-HD for Xbox gaming, so its disappointing! If like me, you can't get the 1080P then overall the 720P is a solid entry-level large-screen TV as many pro-reviewers are saying. BTW: I also looked at the LG 50PA4500 and the Panasonic P50X5 for purely economic reasons, but both earned sub-par reviews versus the Samsung, especially the Panasonic. I even looked at the 46 inch Sony range i.e. Sony Bravia BX453 / BX427 / BX427  purely for the 1080P, but decided against due to the comparably high prices in my area and the lacklustre pro-reviews. Also at home, we have a 720P Samsung from 2006 and its still going well with no screen burn-in even for such an old model!---------------------------------------------------------------GOTCHAS:Overall the Samsung is a capable entry-level large-screen TV. Its one of the better Plasmas too for the price according to online pro-reviewers. But its not 1080P though and I couldn't find a 1080P TV that wasn't LED. LED commands a costly premium for a 3D or Smart badge, both of which are 'questionable features'!Its a horrible time to be buying a TV as over-hyped 3D and overrated SMART LED TV's dominate the retail landscape where I live. It means few economic special offers. The PN51E450 is about the best bet if budget is of primary concern, and like me you've given up on buying a future-proofed TV and are instead accepting an 'OK' TV for now, in the hope that in the future 100 inch flexible screen mega-monster TV's will be here!Its also a horrible time to buy, as 3D and SMART TV gimmicks are unnecessarily increasing prices without corresponding large leaps in picture quality. For instance a laptop connected to the TV via HDMI operated using a wireless USB keyboard will far surpass any SMART TV's onboard software. This is especially so if the laptop has a modern web browser, and a free media player like VLC, that can play every format and rotate photos and videos from landscape to portrait. Moreover, support for 3D is patchy with manufacturers and content providers strategically retrenching from it. BTW: I have a 17\" gaming laptop that uses active shutter 3D glasses. I hardly ever use the 3D feature anymore, as you have to turn up the lighting within the game or power options and it reduces clarity. Its better to run the game at full 1080P resolution without 3D! However, 3D TV is great for animations and animated films but little else IMHO!---------------------------------------------------------------PROS1. PRICE - PRICE - PRICE!2. The USB player is better than I've encountered in the past. Before, I found TV's needed CODEC updates before being able to play a host of different video files. It has a Time Search feature too to skip to a section of the movie. And unlike my previous experience with Philips the Audio doesn't fall out of Sync with the video when you skip forward or back.3. No Smart TV or 3D. I see this as a Pro as it means I'm not over-paying for something that I don't need and which is functionally lacking! Smart TV...'even its name is a dime store joke' to quote Mickey Rourke in Angel Heart. Please no one buy a smart TV thinking its a panacea and a laptop substitute. It is no substitute for a laptop connected to the TV that has VLC or some other Open Source video player that can play any format and rotate video from landscape to portrait, never mind a web-browser substitute. Even a cheap netbook connected to the TV using a wireless USB keyboard will do better. In addition, leading experts say 3D is no longer being invested in by the industry and so is a waste.---------------------------------------------------------------CONS1. The glossy screen makes for difficult viewing during the day as reported in other reviews. This is not a problem for me as I mostly game or watch TV at night, but other reviews on CNET have commented it is off-putting.2. I've had to downgrade in-game graphics to 720P (1280 x 720) otherwise some games run slow even on cutting-edge gaming laptops. Why is that? Games should run in 1080i just fine! Not sure what the cause is yet...3. TV has some HDMI sound issues between games, requiring reset of the TV or computer. further investigation is needed. Had similar problems with a Philips. HDMI is not as reliable as VGA and a sound system!4. SD cable TV signals look bad. i.e. ESPN and Fox Sports. But this isn't the fault of the TV, rather it's the crappy Cable SD signal looking awful on such a large Plasma. SD Dramas look ok. My net + cable provider is cheap but stuck on old SD tech.5. The PIN feature doesn't lock the set. I like to have the LOCK feature in the event of theft, it makes the TV harder for criminals to fence.6. Only two HDMI ports, but I plan to use a $20 remote control HDMI switcher which is fine for a camera etc. But its not what you want for a laptop and a game console.7. No VGA. VGA is handy for troubleshooting quirks with HDMI which are frequent, or if a friend visits with a legacy laptop and wants to show you their holiday photos etc.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Samsung plasma screen TV.", "Author": "SMB \"Susan\"", "ReviewID": "RG9MMYBI3DCSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The item arrived much more quickly than expected.

After reading the reviews and everyone saying how great the picture quality is I went ahead and bought it. I set it up, can only plug in my wii to it, my dvd player had to be hooked up through the cable box, which I'm still not sure is going to work. This would be ok with me except the picture quality is terrible. It is extremely dark, even when brightness is set to 100. I played with the picture options to no avail, the picture is still too dark. It isn't sharp at all. I don't know when I'll get around to watching anything HD on it, but I guess when watching regular tv will have to settle for mediocre image. The sound is pretty great, and that's about the only thing I like about it. Also it was pretty easy to set up, and light enough for me to move it around myself. I will keep it another day and if I'm still disappointed with it I will return it. I'm probably gonna end up returning it...EDITSo I went ahead and watched some things on HD with the TV and the picture is beautiful. I tried playing some videos connected through my laptop using HDMI and the picture was great but the sound was very flat. It lacks a lot of bass. The controls to modify the sound are not really helpful at all though. You'd think they'd have an option to add or subtract bass and treble but it doesn't. Watching netflix on it is pretty bad as the picture is super dark, i know that this is because netflix is not very good, but If i could adjust the tv to be light it would be fine. But it's on the brightest setting, which is good for my cable and HD, but anything else is still too dark. I decided I'm not gonna return it, since I only paid $500 for 51\"... it's not so bad. If I had paid $800 & up I would definitely expect more.Overall an average TV with great HD capabilities, but not enough connection options, and ok sound.

Aghabekian \"Strange Photon\"", "ReviewID": "RN1Q8KI0WZYH9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just picked up the Samsung PN43E450 from a local Wal-Mart last night. It was quite simple to set up from the box, with the bulk of the time being screwing on the base support to the base then the back of the television set. Once my coaxial cable was screwed in, the HDMI for my PlayStation 3 and the other HDMI for my laptop plugged in, and the power cord (which is sufficient but a bit short) attached, I just turned the set on.Samsung has this very uninformative user's guide in the box (which seems to be the trend with electronics these days) but on the paperwork there are several little bar-code type things for you to scan with a smart phone. If you do so, it will bring you tutorial videos for whatever subject that bar-code was for. If you've got time for that, and are curious, feel free. I just followed the excellent on-screen guide that walked me step by step through calibrating the cable signal and the television. I still have to find the universal code for my cable remote, but the TV itself was good to go within less than 5 minutes.Right up front, let me say the picture is indeed darker than the LCD I had prior to this purchase. I understand there are forums on the web that can recommend specific settings configurations to maximize the picture quality, and some even within the reviews here on Amazon. I'll likely do that today. The quality itself was good enough that my woman and I could sit and enjoy a full night of television without having to adjust a thing straight out of the box. If you're used to LCD or LED, you might not be pleased with the darker hues of plasma. If you have a sensitivity to bright light, or get headaches after watching TV, this might be perfect for you.The fact that the resolution is only 720p is surprisingly hard to notice. Having had a 1080p Aquos for so long, I was concerned that dropping down to a lower HD level would be a disappointment. It hasn't been nearly as bad as I expected. This is not to say that if you're extremely picky you won't notice a difference. I'm just saying that with a good digital signal, and even just a few feet of viewing distance, you'll have a hard time seeing any lesser picture quality. The only time I am readily aware of the lower resolution is with shows that aren't broadcast in digital, and when I was playing Skyrim on the PS3. Even then, I only noticed a decreased resolution when viewing the undulating smoke at the bottom of load screens. Something about finely detailed gradients must just not translate as fluidly with lower resolutions.So, as far as picture goes, paying so little AND getting 720p might make you worry about image quality, but in this case, the picture is worth significantly more than the price and specs indicate. I was doubtful of this fact when reading reviews, so I went to a local store to see for myself, and I was positively shocked at the high quality of the picture.The sound quality is another positive element of this set. I haven't explored the possibility of audio settings adjustments yet, but that's mainly because the sound quality from the built-in speakers is of a high enough standard that I haven't felt the need. The strength of sound is very good, with average viewing I've never had to put the volume above 10. It goes to 100, so that should tell you how strong the sound is. I have a very keen ear for audio and through dramas, comedies, sports, and news, it all sounds crisp and clear and even deep when need be. If you do want more than just built-in sound, however, there might be an issue.The biggest reason I took one star away from my rating of this set is that there are no component audio out ports on it at all. Sure, there's an optical audio out port, but if you have an old school Yamaha amp (for example) that uses the old school red and white RCA jacks, then you're SOL unless you also have the option of optical audio. I neglected to find that out before I bought the set, so the fault is partially shared. But, really, who doesn't put that sort of thing on a TV anymore?All in all, I am more than satisfied with this set so far. I even got a 4-year warranty extension that covers everything that doesn't involve me beating the s*** out of the thing with a bat, for only 39 bucks. With the set only costing $398 and change, I couldn't be happier. My old Sharp Aquos cost $1300, and it was smaller. It lasted about six years, just a year past the extended warranty I was given from Fry's Electronics, then it just got all messed up for no apparent reason - hence the purchase of this set. For the money, you can't go wrong. If you are an audiophile who wants even your television sounds through a home theatre system, you probably have an amp that takes an optical audio jack, so the lacking RCA ports won't bother you.Before coming back to gripe at me for leading you astray, remember, I told you the picture was dark, and I told you to find those configuration recommendations to maximize the quality of the image.

Less overly bright, nice saturation and good flesh tones.What I don't get, and can 't find online is how to get good settings paired with the Xbox. With the Toshiba, there seems to be a better communication between the two devices doe everything kind of happens automagically. Toshiba has a game mode that diminishes some of the processing to theoretically get a faster input response for gaming.I have the Xbox connected via HDMI with the label GAME. If I let the XBox choose the resolution for the set, it picks 1366 x 768, which looks ugly, flat and washed out as well. I also have only limited picture menus available. Only Standard, no option for game mode. If I manually change the settings to 720p the picture is better, but I seem to get a fair amount of what I guess is motion blur, even with moving the camera perspective. I have tried the Game settings under the \"Movie\" picture settings, tried changing the labels - I feel like I am missing a setting somewhere. My biggest frustration is that there is a lot of inconsistency with what settings are available with what input. Certain signals turn off certain setting availabilities, so I feel like I am juggling way too many set ups, which seems silly.Long explanation but short question: what settings are you using with your XBox and are you noticing any artifact with fast pans and action?Thanks!Update: I spent quite a while on the chat with Samsung. I really like chat lines. Anyway, we reset stuff, upgraded the firmware, changed cable, even to component, to no avail. Camera movement in video games is horrible. I don't know that there is much to do except return the set.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "BEWARE!!!!!

I began to research the problem to see if I could fix it. WOW...is all I can say. I cant believe the issues with Samsung ty's in general. The same problems (capacitors, capacitors and more capacitors) are occurring on all their televisions. Samsung even has a capacitor phone line strictly dedicated to it. However they refuse to stand behind their product and make the situation right. My warranty date was 1 year from the date of manufacture, NOT, I repeat NOT from the day I bought it! all the good reviews are because we all loved our TV when we first bought it. Too bad there's no longevity to Samsung TV'S.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture and Sound", "Author": "Kurt H.

Most games don't seem to suffer from the extra processing time associated with a large flat screen HD panel.  However, rhythm/music games do.  I found that out when I recently tried to play Rhythm Heaven Fever on it.  I watch mainly football on the TV.  I noted the actual game broadcast does not compare with the stunning visuals of many advertisments during the game.  I guess the games are not broadcast at the higher resolutions.  As is the case with plasma TV's, the blacks are very black.  The contrast enhances the visuals in most cases.  However, the whites are off whites or even weak greys.  I guess you can't have everything.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy a Samsung plasma", "Author": "Michelle L.

When I googled the problem there were a lot of people having the same issue. It was supposed to be a progression thing, a thin line than another than another ........mine had one thin line then kaboom nothing. The screen went black then a crack on the screen appeared.  I called Samsung, told them exactly what happened they said that it would be covered under a one time warranty.  So at this point I was pleased but.........I sent everything in that they asked of me model number, SN, email even the pics they asked for.  So I get an email a few weeks later telling me that they denied my caim and will not honor the warranty like they said they would.  They email basically told me it was my fault that it happened  (crack in the screen) that they will not warranty it.  So I called them on the phone and again they told on the that it was my fault.  I don't like being called a lire so I tore the tv apart knowing that it was going to void any warranty, like that was going to matter any how, and found that the panel (the board that has the hdmi and audio hook ups on it) was completely fried. And right were the board is located inside of the tv is exactly were the crack is on the front of the screen.  So anybody thinking of buying a Samsung plama tv please think of this review first.
