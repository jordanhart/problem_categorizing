Zenith's products are a joke, and it's very clear that this particular product is defective and should have been recalled.  However Zenith would rather keep your $3000+ instead of stand behind their product.  It's no wonder Zenith changed their name to LG because they know that nobody will buy anything that says \"Zenith\" on it.  It's only a matter of time until people catch on to \"LG\" and they earn a bad reputation.  We also sent a very nasty e-mail to Zenith/LG about this, and have not heard squat in response.  Not so much as even a \"We're sorry you're unhappy with the product\".  Thanks for nothing Zenith.  I wish I could have my $4000 back, because less than 2 years from original date of purchase, this t.v. is going to the dumpster.  Would have been only a year if I hadn't had it repaired.Everything below is my original review:I bought this TV 1 year and 2 weeks ago.  Overall I was happy with the picture quality (although the blacks are really splotchy).  Unfortunately, I was watching TV when POP! there went the screen.  Of course the warranty was only for 1 year (even though the website states a 2 year warranty on Plasma TV's) so I just got screwed by 2 weeks.  Reading the other reviews I see out of only 7 reviews, at least one other person has had this happen as well.  This makes me really question the quality of this TV.  Do yourself a favor and buy a Sony or a panasonic or at least get a really long, extended service plan.  Getting burned for $3500 sucks.", "Date": "December 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "details on reviews, please!", "Author": "D.

We leave it on in the evenings, whether or not we're watching it (I like the background noise, and news), so we're probably going on 5,000 hours.For those of you who have had the \"popping\" problem, it would help the rest of us owners (whose TVs are still fine after well over 2 years) to know:(a) What was the manufacture date of your TV?(b) When did you buy the TV?(c) What time of year (month/season) did it \"pop\"?(d) What is your setup? Wall-mount? Stand?(e) Is the area behind the TV well ventilated?*The previous few questions are only because plasma TVs use a lot of power, and of course will run hot (just feel the back after a couple hours). One of the number 1 rules to owning a plasma is to use it in a VERY well ventilated area.(f) What were your TV settings most of the time? Brightness/Contrast? Low/Regular power? Did you lower the settings for the first 200 hours as recommended for all plasmas?(g) How many hours a day did you typically run the TV?I only suggest that people update their reviews with more info, because it might make a difference as to how the owners of working sets continue with their current setup.  If it turns out many of the \"poppers\" were hung on the wall in a room with no venilation behind it, or right up against a wall, or anywhere near a heater/vent, or left on for several hours at a time - that's going to make a huge difference, and it might help others preserve their TVs, saving from the same outcome. The average owner might not be aware of the proper care and setup of their plasma, which could lead to some (of course not all) of the unhappy buyers of this TV.Just a thought.Even if it dies, we had some good times.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "tv died after 15 months,popped and toxic fumes", "Author": "George F.

I was amazed at how many other people had the same experience that I have had with this TV. It was a great TV until about two days after the one year warranty expired. It's funny how Circuit City (were I bought the TV) had kept contacting us about getting an extended warranty. I kept declining, my thinking being, I spent $3,000.00 on a TV, I should be good for 10-20 years. Stupid!!! Two days after the one year warranty, we lost all picture on this TV, nothing but a black screen with audio. This was preceded by red sparkles being visible on black screens and sometimes during actual viewing of a picture. I called LG and at first they said too bad, the warranty was for one year. I was mad! I decided to try again a couple of days later and call them again. This time LG said, no, my warranty was for two years and they would replace this TV with a new one of the same model. This was unusual to me, seeing how they changed answers on their policy, on the second call I made to them. I asked them if our warranty would start over with the new TV and they said \"no\", we would be under our original one year warranty. I asked them if we could get a full refund and they said \"no\". I asked if they were aware of an ongoing problem with this model of TV and they said \"no\". I told them that I have bought TVs at pawn shops that have lasted 10 times as long as this one did.  The person who I was talking to at LG, laughed. He must have thought that this was funny. I for one, do not think this is funny. $3,000.00 is a lot of money too me and I can't believe that there has not been a recall on this model. Will the second TV do the same thing?

But when I read people's reviews on how great the picture was and since I owned a zenith before we decided to order this plasma because it can be hung on the wall. After it arrived, we hook it up (which was easy) turn it on to our local news and were extremely disappointed in the picture.The color was a bit dull, and the picture was a little bit fuzzy, we read the manual and adjusted the setting but still the picture wasn't that great, but not really bad either just not prefect liek you would thinking. We went to a local electronic store thinking maybe we had the TV set up wrong. We were told in order to get that perfect picture we need to buy an HD receiver, HD cables and HD service. Since it is a HDTV it only make sense to have all the right HD connection, so we bought everything suggested and still the picture on our local channels, USA, CNN, Life etc.. was not that great.I called our satellite company thinking maybe there was something wrong with their service because all the reviews had said how great the picture was on this TV and our TV definitely did not a have a beautiful picture. Then I was told to turn to an HD channel YES the picture on HD channels are absolutely beautiful, crystal clear, the colors are outstanding and I see where people get thier great reviews from. But any channel that is not HD really isn't that great, the color is a bit dull and fast moving objects will be blurry. I was told that is how regular channels are on HDTV are!! ONLY HD CHANNELS will be crystal clear (that is why circuit city and best buy always have HD discovery on their TVs for sell so you'll see that beautiful picture and buy it), the only problem with that is there are ONLY 5 HD channels in our area: Discovery, 2 espn, HBO and showtime that is IT!!!So when a review say SD channel or standard channel aren't that great they mean about 200 of your channels (whether it's cable or satellite) will not be that prefect, all HD channel on the other hand will be Outstanding but if you don't watch that much discovery then you might be very disappointed in the picture.Before buying any HDTV whether it's plasma, LCD or DLP you need to find out how many channel are HD channel are in your area?? If not that many then you might want to keep your old TV. We return and purchased several plasma TV over the weeks trying to find one with the best regular (SD, Standard) channels and zenith was the best, Phillip had the worse.The best suggestion I can give anyone if your looking at buying a new TV at a store, ask them to change the TV to a NON-HD channel and then pick the one with the best picture don't pick the tv that has a HD channel on because when you get it home and flip it to CNN you'll be disppointed.", "Date": "February 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Pop --There goes my screen", "Author": "John M.

And if you look THAT close you will notice the 1 or 2 dead pixels you get and you'll just get made.My TV has 1 dead pixel and it bummed me out, but you really can't notice it- unless you look for it.Since this thing costs $3000+ definitely get the extended warranty for peace of mind.
