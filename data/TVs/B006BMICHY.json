I took a chance on this tv assuming that the other review was overly sensitive since he was a digital artist. Boy was i wrong! the tv looks as if you have your color depth settings set to 16bits. terrible terrible. id go so far as saying this is NOT a 1080 or 720 resolution tv. You cant read any text on screen if using a computer. while watching videos the colors bleed into each others pixel. its useless. its not even worth $200.", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Get what you pay for", "Author": "Fate3283", "ReviewID": "RENK6LYQ45XP5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've owned a 720p HDTV from RCA for several years and have always loved it. When it went out I decided to upgrade to 1080p and found this one from Sansui.The picture quality was horrible. The edges were much too sharp, and were only slightly better when the preferences were changed. What was worse though, was the color. Instead of having a smooth transition between colors it was more like abrupt color swatches.I am an illustrator so I work with color all the time, and my friends have told me that I am just overly observant of this sort of thing; that they would have kept the TV. For me it was too much and has been returned and refunded. I could also just have gotten a rotten egg in an otherwise great product line, but I just assume that or a quality 1080p HD youre going to have to spend at least $500", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sansui SLED3280", "Author": "Justin Nakoa Cole", "ReviewID": "R2HIXXMH8N5VWT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazing picture though i use this as a pc monitor. To get games and all working with you a custom made driver may be required. Everything works great the only other problem is if you own a Mac the screen can and will go to 1080p but is shifted over to the right of the screen and can not be corrected. Thus why i give it 4 stars and not 5.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sansui TV", "Author": "MartyZ \"Engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R1K660S5J0RP5Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a TV to fit in a 30.7\" space that had variable audio out, and was 1080p with LED backlight. This unit was perfect. It is 2 years old, but new.I have 3 Sansui, and they are all wonderful. It replaced an 18 month old high end Sony that died. My only gripe and it is Sony's problem. The Sony BlueRay DVD  remote doesn't know Sansui codes and is to crappy to scan for the code. But I was able to get rid of 2 remotes! It seems every Mfg walked away from 1080 for 32 inch TVs.
