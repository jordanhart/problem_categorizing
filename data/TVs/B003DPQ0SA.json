{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally, a TV that has decent sound", "Author": "John \"John_in_NC\"", "ReviewID": "R209LOTVOSQHIP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay maybe a bit large for what I needed which was something in the bedroom. But turned out to work very well. First I need to tell you that this TV has good sound BUT no headphone jack in case you were planning on going with an inexpensive PC surround sound. Only output is Digital(NO OPTICAL) Coaxial SPDIF. Thank goodness you probably don't need it. Speakers are downward firing with tuned ports so the sound is not half bad. In the menu it gives you a Graphic Equalizer over the standard bass and treble you get from most units.So in our bedroom we don't have a cable box, just wanted it for local broadcast stuff. Digital reception works good with the RCA indoor/outdoor amplified antenna but moreover the channel locks in pretty quick so channel hoping is pretty good.What else, oh plenty of contrast. In fact, I had to turn down the color and contrast to get natural looks. Most of the broadcasts are really over doing it so need to wind it back on my end.And it is big, 32\" is very large for a second TV but this was on sale when I got it and after doing side by side comparison in the store I selected this one and it's here to stay.The remote is okay, kind of light but decent. I wish you could get a backlight remote as an option but it's not bad, just rather cheap.Picture on all the new TV's are pretty good, not much blur or artifacting on high motion which I was expecting since only 60hz and although only 720P it still looks fantastic sitting 8-10' away. Not bad on old NON-HD broadcasts either, some tv's have that grain to it but this one isn't bad. Universal Sports over the air broadcast on NBC is usually too grainy but with this it is watchable.I think it's a pretty good deal, very happy with it.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good TV, Good Price", "Author": "Danielle", "ReviewID": "R2SNNS1VZM5JQR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this television today on sale for $289.  It was a great value, and it seems like a really good TV.  Overall I am very pleased with my decision.I haven't had a TV for almost 2 years, and I don't care about 1080i or 1080p or whatever.  This is a 720p, its fine, I'm not into blu ray or HDTV, I keep things simple in my house.  I don't have cable hooked up, so I generally just watch movies or shows I have downloaded online.  Like the other reviewers, it has 3 HDMI outputs, which is cool, I can just hook that into my laptop instead of burning everything onto a disc.It was easy to assemble, you have to screw on the base to the television, and even I, whom has the worst luck assembling things, was able to put it together just fine.The sound is fine for me as well, however, I don't watch TV loudly, so it may just be my preference.  I think the sound quality is the only lacking thing for some, but for me it just wasn't a big deal.Overall, if your not an avid TV watcher or not really into electronics, but want a TV that is more modern, has good sound and picture quality, I would definitely choose this Sylvania.  Oh and I bought this on sale at Target, but since there are so little reviews I am posting one on here as well, since I did a lot of TV research on this site anyway.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "awesome tv for GREAT price!", "Author": "jeff morgan", "ReviewID": "R1ZA9XJMK2CXLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1st of all this is only 720p but it still has great picture.

The picture quality is good, and the sound is adequate. I have to say I haven't really tried it out much, since I haven't had it for long.

It is quite thick, not very appealing design, industrial plastic quality, remote is pretty poor and the picture quality is about average.  Our Samsung of the same size and general specs is MUCH nicer, but it was a couple hundred more dollars.So if you just need an average TV, perhaps to replace your old tube set that rarely gets used, buy this...especially if you get it on sale!", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "good value on this TV", "Author": "Dr. Mike", "ReviewID": "RBNAE6DLZ7O1F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good TV so far.

It is the perfect size for my apartments living room and is a quality television at at good price.The picture and sound quality is good and you can adjust the hue and color to get it just right. Set up was very easy...all you have to do is screw on the base, then plug in your cable and turn it on...a few questions come up on the screen and then it scans for your channels. It has the option to change its format to Normal, Zoom, Wide, 16:9, or Movie Expand.I really like the fact that this tv's frame is not shiny...it is a matte black.  For some reason shiny frames reflect off of the light around the room and bother my viewing.One of the only annoyances (to me) is that the three ports where I plug in my vcr/dvd combo into are on the right side of the tv, so these cords show when they are plugged into the tv.Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "4 months in and still happy", "Author": "Jai", "ReviewID": "R1MOIQOJP2YJX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tv about 4 months ago.

For the price I paid it performs as well as would be expected with one exception. The only problem I have experienced is that when I am changing the channels (surfing because most commercials are stupid)the screen will go green and remain that way until I either turn the unit off then back on or change the source (HDMI, Video, etc.) and then return to the original setting and wait for it to power up again. This event occurs at least once or twice per day. Simply waiting for it to correct the condition is a waste of time.

Setup finished and I was greeted with a beautiful vivid color screen, this is an awesome TV I thought, my feelings of bliss watching 32 inches of eye candy lasted 5 minutes when the screen did an imitation of the Aurora Borealis and all I got was sound, after I tried turning it off and on, unplugging and plugging back in it wouldn't even stay on, pointless anyway since all I would be able to do was listen to it. It's a good thing this major store has a 90 day return policy since it was in the box for 1.5 months to be opened on Christmas day (can you imagine what an embarrassment that was)I returned it the next day and got a replacement, same model. Worked perfect out of the box, once again I was in heaven and enjoyed it the rest of the night. The next night I turned on my cool new 32\" TV whose picture looked so tasty it would make my mouth water and feasted my eyes on.... nothing, yep the replacement set was now a 20lb paperweight, the red standby and the green on light would light-up but would not turn on, that's was it. I returned it and got a refund.Other people seems to have had luck with this TV, but I had two in a row that died on me and luckily they died within the return policy period otherwise I would have been out $300. Just as a side note, the 1st one had a sticker on the box saying it was built in China, the 2nd one had a sticker saying it was built in Thailand.

I'm going to keep it for my bedroom but it's hard to see from the couches and the remote even has a hard time doing what it's told because it's so far from the TV. I love all the HDMI outlets - I use an HDMI cable to hook up my laptop often and the picture quality is amazing. I'm too cheap for pay for HD cable (for now) but standard digital cable still looks nice. Unfortunately, when I moved, the regular, non-HD channels are too wide for this TV. That wasn't a problem at my last place (obviously the cable companies are different). Even adjusting the size, it's much too small to put it on anything but the wide setting.

Eventually, the TV will start to have some problems that will make it just useless. After about 2 months of having the product, it started to change channels by itself. It soon moved to the volume and multiple menu options on the TV. I removed the batteries from the remote so I know it wasn't it, but their still could have been interference or a malfunction inside. This isn't the only problem it has as a few weeks after the channel/volume changes started to occur, the TV wouldn't get a signal for any channel. Occasionally the TV will get a signal, but regardless if it is a HD channel or SD channel on cable or antenna, it doesn't get it otherwise. I have tried multiple things to try to fix these problems, but nothing happens. The sylvannia/funai consumer service department is also HORRIBLE! They treat you like you are dumb and tell you step by step how to see if you have cable or antenna and how to do an autoprogram for channels. I already did everything they told me and since I was past the warranty and return, they couldn't do anything. They haven't even sent me back an email or called since telling me I was past the warranty and return date.So I hope you don't buy this product if you haven't already and if you have, I hope your TV is free from any problems.

I purchased it new from K Mart when they had them on sale for $289. Not bad for a 32-inch LCD 720p HD TV that basically works and has a lot of inputs to choose from.There are two primary issues I have with the TV, however:1) If I autoscan channels, it finds a number of analog and digital channels. If I then turn off the TV then back on again (even if I wait awhile between turn off and turn on), it forgets ALL of the digital channels! It only remembers the analog channels. I called support about this problem, and they wanted me to return the TV to K Mart for exchange. But frankly, I think this is a firmware problem, not a problem with just my TV (I think?). My work-around for this problem is to go to the Add Channels function and add each digital channel (even though it's been found automatically) BEFORE I turn the TV off after an auto scan. It will then remember them. Note that I did update to the latest firmware.2) The overall \"tone\" of the display is a little on the dark side. I've adjusted the brightness up to compensate, but can only go so far to keep it from washing out. It just doesn't have what I'd call *excellent* image quality. But it is *good*.Since I have a work-around for the channel autoscan problem, I am happy enough with the TV for what I paid for it. I am not sorry I made this purchase.

The pic quality from the S-VHS isn't as crisp as it was on my old Sony Trinitron (as expected) but acceptable.The picture quality from an HD source (DirecTV)and a DVD player seem to be better if you set the max output from the DVD/DirecTV sources to 720p.

Overall picture quality of this 720p tv is good.I hooked up a $10 antenna and scanned for over the air (OTA)stations.  It found all the Austin stations and the picture quality/sound was good.Sound is great.

I hated paying extra, but I have bad luck, and as luck would have it, the mp3/cd player boombox we bought that night had to go back cause one speaker new out of the box wasn't working, and I once saw an expensive large screen t.v. once need hundreds of dollars in repairs cause the electronic board wasn't soldered completely and gave out after two years, after the warranty expired.Anyway, its not 1080P, but was cheaper, and is only 720P, but I still don't know the difference since this is my first hdtv.  Three hdmi ports, but plenty of other ports to choose from, what is confusing is that \"USB\" looking port on it, on the side, the box doesn't say anything about it, nor do the instructions, and it is marked \"service terminal\", which I was thinking was for \"service\" I suppose, like maybe a technician, who knows, I notice alot of other brands advertising a usb port as a way of showing pics on a memory stick, I don't own a memory stick but I am computer literate enough to be able to view pics on screen, IF that is what the usb port is for \"servicing\", dunno.If I had to guess anything that could be risky on it, that would be the remote control, it is small, and cheap looking, but seems adequate enough.  Right now I am using the \"S\" video port for regular dvd player, that shows up on \"video\" on the list, along with component and regular t.v and the three hdmi ports.  The way things are, you need as many hdmi ports as possible, and some t.v.'s I noticed only have two or one, and this has three, a good thing.  This tv even has the screw on 75 ohm old style connector, a good thing since if I put it in the other end of the home, the satellite service only ran a 75 ohm line to that end of the home, but the other family member watches tv in there mostly and can't watch t.v with an hd cable cause we are only using one sat box, dual tv mode.What I was impressed with is the screen formats you can switch to, when I first turned it on, the main screen shown a smaller view as default, but you have to press \"format\" to go to 16x9 screen format for the whole wide screen to be filled, there is also \"movie expand\", \"zoom\", and \"wide\", make sure to know how to adjust between, having been unfamilar, I thought there was something wrong at first.Other than that, I had/have the option locally to return the unit within the first thirty days no questions asked if I wasn't \"satisfied\", by the 27th of august, I still can, but there seems to be no reason, 1080P units are still a hundred dollars or more expensive and this is working out just fine, and I don't have a steller home theater setup to really care, have no blue ray player, and I use a really old stereo receiver for enhanced sound on movies.I think 720P is just fine for the average person unless you are a kid whose friends all have 1080P, I mean, who cares, the satellite service gave us free hd and a cable and I can't see a difference compared to non hd channels.  I look at 1080P screens and 720P screens at the store playing the same thing and whoopie, big deal, there must be a difference so subtle its hard to tell.I spent about four hours reading reviews for folks experiences with blue ray players, newer and older, along with t.v. set reviews and I come to believe that blue ray is over rated and unreliable and too new for the technology used to show it, all the blue ray players take about a minute to start up, even the ones saying they'll do it in five seconds, and some aren't reliable, there are too many folks on their second and third blue ray player in a couple of years due to some brands just not working one day, sometimes at one year old.  I'm about to just get a upconverter to increase the resolution of regular dvd's, otherwise the latest panasonic or panasonic bd65 or LG 550 or above would technically be supposed safe bets, panasonic always having good track records, and actually, I have a really old five piece carousel panasonic dvd player about ten years old that is still going strong, mainly for cd's now, but it got used alot, though it has compatibility issues with some recorded backup cd r's.  A word on blue ray, I don't know if it is a big city thing or what, but they add in the ability on all the new blue rays to download movies and streaming video, but rurally, there isn't really that much high speed access other than digital satellite, I can't see myself downloading movies even if I had \"it all\" high speed to do so, I collect movies, and enjoy renting them at the rental store, it must be a kiddy thing or big city thing to be a big deal to be downloading, almost like those who really go for all the latest cell phone fun.As for upconverters, using hdmi cables, wow, that can be a problem too if you don't do some research, I mean, I won't spend more than fifty bucks for one, and you shouldn't either, they say the blue ray players \"upconvert\" regular dvds, supposedly, but there were a few reviews that some weren't that convinced, so I am thinking it might be prudent to get a cheap upconverter and note the goodness of it and have a blue ray player later or too, I mean, the durability and trouble of starting up these blue ray players might mean it would be wiser to use an upconverter for regular dvds, and leave a blue ray player to playing blue rays only.  Frankly, I wouldn't buy a blue ray player without purchasing at least a two year extended warranty contract like I do locally, maybe even a three year extended warranty on blue ray only, cause they are just too new a technology so far, kind of reminds me of when cd players first came up for sale in the late 80's, I had one go out on me, and a second have compatibility issues until I purchased an expensive upper brand name for loads of cash, I mean like $400 in 1990.  I believe blue ray players is the driving force behind alot of new tv purchases in 720P to 1080P right now, since alot of folks like myself may have multiple tv's already, including recent flat screen tube models sold just two years ago, now everything is light weight LCD or LED models.#$$$Oh, one note of interest, I am guessing I am really behind the times, I had to ask what an \"LED\" tv is, and that is a tv screen backlit by leds's, which last longer than what backlights LCD screens I suppose, like this LCD sylvania.  Really, then there is the whole plasma screen thing, a neighbor blew loads of cash on a plasma screen and swears it aint no better than his older projection t.v.I just hope that this Sylvania LCD lasts as long as the oldest tv in the house, the well used ten year old Philips Magnavox 26 inch screen, that only has dvd inputs on the back with regular cable connection, its still going.Hope this helps, I know that I am absolutely reading reviews at amazon all the time, I'll probably get a dvd upconverter with cable from amazon, hdmi cables are cheaper through amazone than locally.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "supports 1080i,720P,480i,480p\n1366x 768 WXGA res\nSleep Timer, auto shut off", "Name": "Sylvania LC320SL1 32-inch 720p LCD HDTV, Black (2010 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31wzB-7nEwL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003DPQ0SA"}}
