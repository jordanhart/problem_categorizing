If you name it \"PC DVI\" then audio can't be passed via HDMI. I apologize for the confusion, and thank you to the commenter who made me aware of this. I've updated the review with this new info.```````````````````````````````````````````````Quick note to everyone giving this monitor/tv combo bad ratings due to the PC HDMI quality:The PC HDMI quality is perfect, but you have to make a quick change to get the optimal settings. If you don't do this, the resolution and size of the screen won't set properly and fonts will be blurry.Step 1: Plug the HDMI from the PC to HDMI port 1 of the monitor.Step 2: Press \"source\" on the remote.Step 3: Press \"tools\" on the remote, and change the name of the HDMI Input 1 to \"PC\"It would be nice if the monitor could auto-detect and configure itself, but the process takes less than a minute, so it's not a very big deal. Changing the name of the input configures the monitor to the optimal settings of a PC digital connection.`````````````````````````````````````````````I'm a college student and needed a very specific type of monitor. I needed a monitor to plug my laptop and PS3 into, as well as the cable TV in the dorm. This monitor also had to be fairly small in order to fit into the small dorm, be affordable, and have decent picture quality for movies and games. This product hits all my specifications right on the head and far surpassed my expectations with it's abundance of connections and phenomenal 1080P picture quality.=========The Good=========This monitor is awesome for the price. You get a great 5 million to 1 contrast ratio with a high quality LED screen. Movies and games look great on this screen. I have my PS3 and laptop hooked up to it and it works flawlessly. Perhaps the biggest selling point of this monitor, however, is the plethora of connections: 2 HDMI, VGA, D-sub, 3.5mm Headphone jack, optical audio out, Audio IN, Component (via included adapter), USB, and RF cable TV input! Unlike my reflective laptop screen, I haven't seen any glare or reflections in my monitor thanks to the bright, vivid LED screen.Also, the remote on the monitor is fantastic, responsive, and easy to use - it's very similar to the remote that came with my parents' Samsung Bluray player. Very few monitors come with a remote, much less such a good one. You may be thinking that having a remote is pointless (that's what I thought at first), but since this monitor has speakers and a TV tuner, a remote really helps! Let the laziness commence!=========The Bad=========There's no DVI cable input which is really the only other important connection this monitor lacks. However, this can be compensated with a little DVI to HDMI adapter you can buy for under $10 here on Amazon. The monitor has a 5ms response time which is fine, but for playing games, 2ms would have been nicer.EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: Originally I thought the audio couldn't be passed from computer to the monitor via HDMI, but this is because I named the input \"PC DVI\" instead of \"PC\". If you name the input \"PC\" then you can set the sound options on your computer (on Windows, right click the speaker sound icon on the bottom right and select playback devices). Sorry for the confusion.=========The... lolwhat?=========As with all TN panels, horizontal viewing angles are good, but the screen images distort when you view from different vertical angles. Luckily, Samsung threw in a random \"Magic Angle\" feature to fix this by putting in two modes that allows the screen to adjust if you're watching from a point above the screen or a point below the screen. It's still not as good a looking directly, head-on, but it definitely helps.The built in speakers aren't really that great; they aren't bad, but they're far from surround sound speakers. They can get surprisingly loud on max volume. Luckily, there's plenty of ways to output the volume to surround sound, or in my case a little 2.1 $50 sound system. We're lucky that this monitor even has speakers as most monitors don't.Also, I don't understand what other reviewers are saying about the picture in picture mode. You can use it easily to display TV in a small box in any corner of the screen. You can either be on one TV channel with a small TV show in the corner, or even use the monitor with your PC connected and watch a TV show in the corner. You can chose which corner, which channel, and whether to make the picture in picture small or large.=============Bottom Line: This monitor is serving me really well for the purpose I'm using it. 21.5 inches may be too small for a primary living room TV, but it's perfect for a dorm and possibly an office or work desk. For this price, there are really no other companies that offer this many connections and a TV tuner in a computer monitor. I recommend that you examine what you're looking for in a TV / monitor before buying this as it caters to a very small crowd. If you just want a good computer monitor, you can get something cheaper with a better response time. If you're looking for a TV, you probably want something bigger. Or, if you're like me and need something that's reasonably large for movie watching (when alone or with small groups), fits on a desk, and is capable of doubling as a TV and monitor, look no further.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great LED TV/Monitor, 2 for the price of 1!", "Author": "Scott J. Gibson", "ReviewID": "R14YHANEY2P2O8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great LED TV/Monitor for the price.  It has a great picture and sound.  I am using it mostly as a monitor, but wanted the PIP option.  I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about, but PIP works great and has sound(set the sound to SUB in the PIP menu) and you can choose the size and position of the PIP.  I also like the touch buttons on the bottom front of the TV, very convenient.  I am using the HDMI/DVI port to connect to my PC, so you do have to make sure you label it as DVI PC so the monitor recognizes it as a PC input and gives you the best picture.  If you read the manual, you should have no problems.  It has a USB port, so you can plug in a flash drive and view movies or pictures.  Watched an AVI movie and worked great!CONS:  These are just minor irritations:I am using this as a computer monitor and am using the HDMI/DVI port for my PC.  When my computer goes into standby, the LED monitor doesn't have a standby mode for the HDMI/DVI port, so it stays on even though the computer is in standby.  If you use the VGA port for your computer though, the monitor will go into standby when your computer does.  Frankly, I see no difference in picture quality between the HDMI and the VGA for my PC, so I might just use the VGA port.The other thing is I wish it had a touch button for PIP on the front of the monitor so I can quickly turn on PIP without going through the menu.All in all, this is a great TV/Monitor for the price, granted I have only owned it now for a few weeks, but Samsung makes pretty good products, so I am hopeful it will last.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love It!!", "Author": "PaulaG", "ReviewID": "RM3ELEWX5V7RU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was the second attempt at a Samsung 22 inch HDTV. The first one didn't have VGA so it went back. Thank you Amazon for the free return. I plugged this one in to the cable box - it came right on. I plugged the VGA cable in and changed the source to PC. Bingo - plug & play was perfect. We did have to adjust the picture and the sound, but it looks and sounds fine.

It delivers what it promises.  However, I had a SyncMaster P2370HD PC/TV and I think it is better than this one.  The only reason I have bought this one is because it has the USB plug-n-play feature. I can't find a way to do the PiP feature and there isn't a manual instruction about this. The quality of all the cords could be better. The monitor stands okay on itself, but the swivel base is weak and held by 2 small screws and it can break easily. The swivel can be adjust to lean the monitor back about 30 degree, or straight up, but you have to do this before putting the 2 little screws on the back together, I afraid that it will break if you adjust of angle of the monitor after.  Overall, it is a good desk monitor for the money.

I also wanted it to double as a third monitor.  It is accomplishing both of those goals very nicely.  The picture quality is very good and the size of it is just right for a small home office.  With three monitors in front of me there is a lot of real estate used, but that's just the way it is.  The connections on the monitor are good though I thought it quite strange that there was no DVI connection.  That's ok since I'm using the VGA, which is workiing out quite nicely.I can't comment on the speakers since I don't use them.  This TV is connected to my Verizon FiOS and DVD player via a multimedia receiver.One thing I don't particular like and that is the touch sensitive area used as buttons.  There are no actual buttons, just a \"touchpad\" of sorts on the bottom frame.  i don't like that.  I like to feel a button so if the lights are off (while watching a movie for example) or low I can feel for the buttons to change controls.The TV comes with a remote, but I don't use it too much since the TV is right in front of me.I do recommend this product for anyone wanted a nice relatively small tv for the office.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "This model will not last longer than about one and a half years", "Author": "Daniel Park", "ReviewID": "R26YGYH1P7VNIB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this monitor replaced three times, and each time I get it replaced, it dies in about one to one and a half years.

I do not play games so I have no idea how this monitor would work in a game situation. I bought it because it had a digital receiver built in and would double as a small televison with hi def. The receiver makes it possible to split the cable and receive local high definition stations without the additional expense of a high definition cable box rental. The picture is excellent and it is a very good monitor as well. It can be manually adjusted for proper positioning as well as the on screen lean back mode. It is sturdy and attractive. The PIP mode is really a plus. You will probably want to buy a set of speakers. The sound quality is not great. I have owned it for about a year and I would absolutely buy it again. In fact, if you are just looking for a small televison with 1080p, I find this monitor to be sturdier than other small televisons if you wish it to be free standing.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Charles W.

I've only set up the monitor so far, but it works great for that purpose. I connected a Lenovo T500 laptop via a passive displayport-to-hdmi cable to the monitor. Make sure to set the port name to 'pc' as indicated by another reviewer - a 10-second change that improves clarity considerably. Windows 7 automatically supports the monitor and I can also use Windows 7 in dual-monitor mode with the laptop as 1 monitor and the samsung as the other monitor - perfect.I have a 2nd computer at the office desk, so I used the VGA input on the monitor to view that computer. That computer runs Windows XP and its a decade old. I needed to download a new video driver for the video card (nvidia) to allow the computer to support the high def resolution. That was a simple upgrade. And now that computer has a new monitor - and the computer even 'feels' newer - like a new coat of paint (but of course, not any faster).With the hdmi input from the laptop and the vga input from the WinXP computer - I can simply hit the 'source' label (not actually a button) on the monitor face and easily switch to view the other computer.For some of the other cons mentioned:- for me, the monitor does go into standby mode if the laptop goes into standby mode - connected in displayport to hdmi mode.- don't be discouraged by the the 'change it to \"PC\" setting' - its a 10 second change done with the remote control.Buy this monitor/tv - you'll be happy.... next up ... run a tv cable to it.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung TV - the best!", "Author": "Gee Mendonca", "ReviewID": "R1W9TJDHBXOOWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a great deal for such nice TV 1028p and extended monitor!

I think this monitor is primarily designed to be used in the workplace.  I can't imagine anyone buying this as a primary TV monitor.  It's too small.  So the secondary fucntionality is TV.  However when samsung put in the PIP , they just forgot many things.  a)  If you're in PC mode, the PIP of the TV has no sound!  So just plain useless.  When I talked so samsung reps, they said, \"Oh, that's only  if you use hdmi and coaxial and purely for tv only and not for pc\". WHAT!?!  Who is going to use a 22\" monitor as their primary TV monitor!  I don't get it.  PLus the PIP size cannot be changed.  It cannot be moved around the screen (not even 4 corners).  Really overpriced for what it does.Resolution is fine.  But you can pretty much get this size or even a larger size monitor (without the tuner) for less than 1/2 the price.P.S :Just an advice for anyone who's planning to buy a monitor for PC with TV Tuner.  If you want to watch TV while using your PC monitor, just buy a  TV Card (HD) for your PC  and they even come with DVR features where they can record channels to the harddrive and also has dynamic sizing of the TV box on screen.  There are couple of companies which make reasonably good cards (happauge and diamond).I paid way too much and now I'm stuck with this monitor , as I already returned another monitor I got skipping the restocking fee and now they say I can't return it without restocking.Update: 12/26/2011.Ok. I finally figured out the PIP sound issues.  I gave it two more stars.  The support is really bad though. They have no clue what I'm talking about and they pretty much said, that the monitor cannot do it.  But it was false and I was able to figure it out.  They could have made the PIP slightly bigger (atleast 3-4 size choices instead of 2).
