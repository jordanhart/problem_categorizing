{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent value for the money!", "Author": "R. Ocampo \"Artisan\"", "ReviewID": "R3HQXN1EQO4Z7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Plasma technology is still the best in terms of brightness, contrast and physical dimensions. You can hang it on a wall and cramp it in tighter spaces.The other option would be an LCD screen, but the picture quality (artifacts) and price factor would make it an odd decision to go for when you could shell out a little more for a Plasma display. Also beware there are two types of LCD screens - LCD and LCD projection. LCD is the same as the computer monitors. Although it has greatly improved since it's introduction, it's still slow and expensive. LCD projection I would shy away from at the moment because it doesn't compare to DLP. Although Sony came out with a so-called \"3LCD\" technology to rival the high-end DLP 3-chip systems. Know that DLP was first for the 3-chip technology (for their high-end applications like major movie houses), it's not who's first as time will tell how each fare.Yet a good rival that has been hitting the market is LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon). JVC has renamed this HD-ILA and Sony came out with their own name branding - but they are all LCoS technology. Prices have yet to come down and is said to have none of the \"cons\" of LCD and DLP projection TV by exhibiting good blacks, great speed in drawing the picture and no rainbow effect. Until prices drop to competitive levels with the rest of the other products, this won't be on my list until next year.The next best option behind Plasma, IMO, is DLP by Texas Instruments. It gives the  best blacks and color rendition among it's class of projection televisions.How good is DLP? It was the first and no-brainer choice for commercial theaters that project digital movies (i.e. the first digital screening of Star Wars prequels). These are front-projection units that need a reasonably dark room to refrain from washing out the colors it projects to the screen. For personal viewing in bedrooms and living rooms, you need a rear-projection DLP. This encases the whole unit like a regular projection television, and is more kind to ambient light.A. The downside to DLP rear-projection monitors is:The amount of moving parts it entails to create the picture -1. A digital micromirror device (DMD) to reflect light in 1,024 different shades of gray. Because these tiny mirrors each move independently, there is a risk of failure.2. A color wheel that spins in thousands of revolutions per minute to help create the  color. The wheel bearing will eventually wear out and will need to be replaced by a technician over time. Furthermore, the noise created as it spins to speed is evident when you power up the monitor. Although any minimal audio volume will drown this sound out.3. The lamp (light bulb) that projects the image onto the screen, just like any other light bulb, has a usable life. Each manufacturer states how long their bulbs will last before it needs to be replaced. A typical life span for 4 hours of viewing each day will last around 4 years. The good news: it only takes to replace the bulb in order to bring the picture quality back to like new just as when you bought the TV. This is versus Plasma and LCD which lose their brightness over time (LCD rear projection also takes replacing the bulb).4. The amount of heat created by the lamp is enormous that you can't box the unit in a cabinet nor stick it's back side too near to the wall unless you want to increase wear on the monitor or create a melt-down.B. The upside is the picture quality you get. In fact the price you would have paid to get this kind of quality and usability over time is unfathomable you would be glad you didn't have to pay for Plasma (of course if you can afford a Plasma or need to hang it on a wall, then this is your only option). Just replace the bulb and you're good to go for another 4 years or so. You can't do that with a Plasma and re-charge the gasses. Unlike Plasma, it's brightness virtually stays constant throughout the usable life of the lamp. Samsung will warn the user when it is nearing the end.C. Physical dimensions enable you to lift the monitor alone. Try doing that to a CRT. Samsung's \"floating screen\" design enables the picture to give a good impression that the picture is on it's own space. However, the silver accent below the screen (although very elegant) does not fully take the effect into what they are marketing it to be as any light falling on the silver accent reveals the screen is not floating.With all being said, four stars for this monitor because Samsung gives us a lame manual that leaves the technical savvy people out of the loop and questioning for more information - despite the TV having one of the best picture quality and Samsung technology loaded into the monitor (enhanced picture processing and the abillity to fine tune the colors based on ambient light surrounding).Four stars because despite all the technology loaded, they give us one HDMI in socket that doubles as the old DVI socket care of your own ability to buy an HDMI to DVI cable. No FireWire audio input/output unlike other manufacturers. And only one digital audio output courtesty of an optical Toslink connection.The good part is Samsung's strict policy for defective mirror devices, strict manufacturing tolerance and elegant design which helps you trust buying their products more than other manufacturers.A word of caution to shoppers and owners of DLP and other technology that enable true high definition output: the reason for most bad reviews is their disappointment when watching with various low quality sources. They are mislead into thinking their picture quality will improve with these kinds of monitors. On the contrary a monitor of this caliber will show even more imperfections and reveal the low quality output that is being fed into it - garbage in, garbage out. Subscribing to digital cable/satellite isn't enough. You have to subscribe to HDTV and be viewing HDTV sources in order to see it's full potential. MTV isn't HDTV. Know which channels air in high definition. Discovery Channel HD (not simply Discovery Channel) is the perfect viewing sample.You want to maximize the input of sources by using HDMI/DVI cables. Don't use RCA or S-video jacks for this monitor. The least video cable you should use is component cable. Even that I wouldn't recommend because that would mean transmitting analog video signal from source (cable box, DVD player) to TV. Keep the signal pure and clean as possible by keeping it digital until the last minute.Lastly, this monitor's standard output is 720p (progressive) output. Other lower or higher sources fed into the unit will make it convert to 720p. This is helpful info into putting less strain or digital conversion and artifacting to the monitor - feed it 720p signal already so all the monitor has to do is output directly rather than do further processing.If you want the latest technology, this \"old\" technology isn't for you as there are already a handful of 1080p monitors in the market including monitors made by Samsung. If you're on a budget and want a bang for your buck, you won't make a mistake with this purchase and handing it down the line when  you're ready to make a step up into the future (for the same price you purchased this unit).", "Date": "November 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Samsung 42\" DLP TV", "Author": "Dandy Don \"techboy\"", "ReviewID": "R9T746UU090ZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The performance of the Samaung 42\" lived up to my expectations.

Performance on normal analog channels is fair to good compared to direct view TV performance on the same channels (both HD and analog are off cable).  Digital audio sound is excellent.  The setup and custom adjustment menus are easy to use but sometimes annoying as the menus have 4 to 5 layers.  The TV fits in a very small space for its screen size (width and depth are the smallest available for this size).

It's very light (about 50 pounds), not very deep (maybe 14 inches) and the picture quality is outstanding.  Try watching one of the Pixar movies on it, you will be astounded and Discovery on HD is almost better than going on vacation. It's a table top DLP projection TV, so there are no pixels to burn out like LCD or Plasma, it fits on most TV carts, and the price was awesome.  Including shipping to Texas, I paid $400 less than what I would have paid in store because the retail price was lower, and I didn't have to pay sales tax.  It's simple to use, and only requires a bulb replacement every few years, much like a computer projector would.  There is one warning I can bestow, and that is despite showing HDTV content gorgeously, the quality on regular stations may \"appear\" to dip.  You get used to this, though and Samsung recommends hooking your cable/satellite receiver up to the TV using 2 connections (one component or HDMI, and one S-video, the latter helping with the picture quality of the non HD channels).  All in all, I am VERY happy with this TV.

Here's the deal.  When Samsung was mass-producing these (2005, mainly), they anticipated that the lamp would be the first part to go--and most comments on here from that time point out that you'll have to expect to replace the lamp within a few years.  Well ... you'll be lucky if it's the lamp.  There are several other parts that could fail, including the lamp ballast, the color wheel, and the DMD board, and you'll have NO way of knowing which it is, because the television's error lights will not tell you.  A Samsung tech admitted this to me over the phone: they just weren't thinking ahead, because they expected the lamp to be the only part that the consumer would have to replace.  But do an internet search for any of the parts that I just mentioned, and you'll find plenty of unhappy Samsung owners complaining that their TV has stopped working and they can't figure out which part is to blame.That's what happened to me too.  The TV started shutting off, with the little error lights blinking to indicate that the lamp was defective.  So I replaced the lamp ($150 with shipping, if you buy it online from Samsung), and, lo and behold, it didn't fix the problem.

A 42\" TV with new technology for such a low price seemed a bit strange, and I had somewhat of a hunch that maybe they were dumping them off at a low price because of poor quality.  That has all since subsided.However, when I first received the television the FIRST DAY of usage I had a big problem with it.  After a few hours of usage the TV shut off by itself.  I had originally thought that I may have laid on the remote control, so I turned the TV back on to only have it shutoff again about 30 seconds later.  I noticed the lights in front of the television flashing, and having remembered seeing something about that in the manual, I looked to find out the bulb is defective.  This seemed to confirm my aforementioned fears, and so I immediately called Samsung to have a repairman come fix the thing.  A defective bulb is no big deal, but annoying nonetheless.  Well needless to say, I don't like their method of appointments, they put in a \"ticket\" and then have someone call YOU back to make the arrangement.  It took them almost 5 days (including saturday and sunday) to call back, and the appointment was 10 days from the day I arranged it.It was a definite inconvenience to have a large television sitting in the middle of a room completely unable to function, but taking into consideration that it was the holiday season, I suppose it can be excused.  The repairman came mid-morning, took his shoes off at the door, was quiet and polite and immediately went to work on the television.  He left no doubt in my mind that he was an expert at what he does, and after replacing the bulb realized there was a problem with some internal component so he replaced that as well.Although it was an inconvenience to have to go through that process for the television, I couldn't be happier with what I paid for it and the resulting picture.  I have the TV connected through a Monster Cable HDMI (if you want top of the line, go with Monster even though its extremely pricey) with a Comcast DVR-HD box.  Sports are clearly the superior quality, but the overall quality of the HD channels is amazing.  I also have a Playstation 2 connected through the component cables and it looks  just as good considering its not an HD output.  But if you are going to connect a non-hd system (xbox, ps2) I suggest getting the component cables because using the RCA plugs was horrid, blurry, and not even worth playing.Beyond all of that this television was a great buy, and even though the price has since gone up its still not THAT bad.  I'd have given it 5 stars, but to me 5 stars would be a 1080p output.

(New Color Wheel) its called the HL-S4266W which has a new Color wheel.Upon first reading about this TV i was a bit skeptical. The whole \"The Shell on the bottom of the screen when your seeing black on the scrren.\" First of all you do see a little what looks like a white shell on the bottom of ths screen. However is is barely noticable unless your trying to pick it out (Had my friend try to find something wrong with the screen when it was all black and he had problems finding the \"Shell\")When i was buying a TV i needed one that was less the 40\" in width because my wall unit is only 40\" wide. So i was looking at a lot of Plasma's and LCD's but all of them were around 41-45\" because of the side mounted speakers. This TV however was 39.3\" wide which fit perfecly in the space. At first i hooked up my Xbox360 to the system with my friend and booted it up. The TV makes a chime sound which is a little catchy but not positive nor negitive in my opinion. I get to the Xbox screen, set it for 720P/Widescreen. So i start playing a game and my first reaction was it looked like crap compared to my Sony 60\" WEGA Tv. After my friend left I was looking over at the Xbox and figured out that the video cable was switched to EDTV instead of HDTV. When i switched it to HDTV i saw a HUGE differnce. The picture was really really sharp and the TV is VERY bright which is good for movies and games. I am really happy with the purchase of this TV and i would reccomend it to anyone that is looking for a good cheap Hi-Def TV.Pros: - Looks amazing if you feed it a High-Def source. - Very nice and bright if you want to play games or watch movies. - The interface is very clean and neat. (Not importaint but i like it) - It is a very nice looking TV compared to some others i saw at Bestbuy. - I like the speakers at the bottom of the TV. It gives the screen a very clean and nice cut.Cons: - This TV brings out details from bad sources such as a standard DVD Player (I would just purchase a Upconvert DVD Player which outputs to 720P and you will have a amazing picture) - The Bulb will burn out in about 2-4 years (Depending on use)", "Date": "November 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "SAMSUNG PRODUCT BACKUP", "Author": "Geraldine Bass \"PARTNER8823\"", "ReviewID": "R3QWO3U5BZZDCN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I HAD SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH TV NOT TURNING ON, AFTER HAVING PURCHASE A YEAR AGO.

My first bad decision was to purchase any HDTV before I had a digital signal. What stores or manufacturers won't tell you is that the analog picture is surprisingly poor; not as good as your old tv picture. Consumer Reports will back this up with the black circle ratings (poorest quality) for the best of plasma, LCD, and DLP hdtvs, but I received that info a day later. I owned the Samsung 42\" hdtv for just one day and returned it to BestBuy ( they were running a special with a price very close to Amazon's) and may buy later this year after  I get digital service (and a probable Samsung hdtv price drop). So I am collecting digital service prices (cable and satellite), including Verizon's Fios cable that is just being built in my area.

I bought it for \"no screen burn\" when viewing 4:3, for the fact that the picture looks better then most other DLPs, connections and of course price when compared to LCD and Plasma.  Overall, great piece of equipment, speakers are truly exceptional. We have had it for about 2 years and the brightness seems to be fading, quick adjustment and it looks like when new. Though, be sure to buy the extended warranty-the mirror device that spins to produce the picture shattered right after warranty expired, but we bought an extended warranty (for the bulb replacement option, priced at $400 per bulb when we purchased) and I am so happy we did.  After the replacement, there are artifacts as I am sure due to the glass shattering into a million pieces inside the box. The tech vacuumed the box, but it looks like he missed a few pieces of glass because we can see white spots when a black picture shows. I will have to call them to fix the picture problem.
