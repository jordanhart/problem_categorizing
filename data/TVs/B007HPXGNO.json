{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "D. Lovelock", "ReviewID": "R1L6NVPGBBJ4KY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV is very nice for the pricepoint.  Good picture, good size, good brand.  The only weird thing is that HDMI ports are on the side.  If you loop the cord around the back and kind of hook it behind the power cord it's not visible, but it is a little strange.  There are no buttons on the TV, it's a little joystick on the underside on the right that you push to turn on the TV then control a menu with standard functions.  I was very surprised at first but it works out just fine and it's actually quite nice how simple it is.  One other thing to note, the factory picture settings didn't look quite right to me.  After fiddling with the picture controls I got it to look fantastic.The accessories are a nice little add on.  Everyone can use extra HDMI cables, surge protectors, and even possibly a mount.  Honestly I would have ordered it without the extras but they are nice to have.I ordered this after I had been looking at the one that ships direct from Amazon.  The price is close, but I went with this one due to the extras and that I don't have to pay tax on it right away in my state.  I was shocked to receive it as fast as I would have via Amazon Prime, possibly faster... I ordered late Wednesday night and received it on Friday.  Granted, it only shipped from NJ to central NY, but still, they were really on the ball.Overall I'm very satisfied.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007HPXGNO"}}
