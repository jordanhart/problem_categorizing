Now it is outdated and will not play new Blu rays . We called Insignia regarding this, and they said tough luck. One manager went as far as you say the customer is always wrong. Please spread the word on this share this with everyone you know. I can't believe a company would be so awful. After 3 years a Blu ray player will not work on new movies anymore . That is ridiculous not to mention it's environmentally harmful to make an electronic that will only last three years ! Please share this with everyone. Do not buy Insignia!", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Tabletop stand with screws , Remote with 2 AAA batteries\nComponent video cable, audio cable, USB port\n600:1 contrast ratio (7000:1 dynamic) 1366 x 768 resolution\nTwo 3W speakers, Include 2 HDMI/DVI (side), 1 composite (rear), 1 component video (rear), 1 PC (side), 1 PC audio (side), 1 S-video/composite audio shared (side) and 1 RF (side).\nIncludes 1 analog audio (side) and 1 headphone jack (side).PC video input", "Name": "NEW INSIGNIA 15\" Class / LED / 720p / 60Hz /  NS-15E720A12", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lqKGFeX6L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005TRRPIO"}}
