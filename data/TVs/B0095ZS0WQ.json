{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Value... but some minor disappointments", "Author": "Richard C. Randall", "ReviewID": "R1VNYOOZSKNJ5W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ultimately, the LG 32LS3450 32\" 720p is a great TV for the price.Positives:Great picture (be advised that Dish TV, Direct TV, etc. all compress the HD signals - so to get a proper view of the picture, either get the HD from a Blu-Ray disk or an antenna - over-air HD is not compressed, so it looks much better). Most TVs with this kind of picture are much more expensive... hence the great value. I also like the remote and the navigation. Hooking up a Blu-Ray/DVD player and Roku was pretty standard (the TV has 2 HDMI inputs as well as plugs for RGB or the single yellow video plug accompanied by 2 audio plugs).Disappointments (note that I tend to focus on the negatives when reviewing a product - because things that work are supposed to):- It was impossible to mount the stand properly to the TV. Fortunately, since the TV slides into the stand, this isn't critical (a design/manufacturing flaw).- The TV lacks an Internet input (or WiFi) for streaming. So you'll need an external device for that.- Initially my Roku HD didn't work when plugged into an HDMI port, but would work when plugged into the yellow video plug. This problem was easily corrected by resetting my Roku HD (LG Tech Support helped me solve that problem).- I noticed that when I switch to the HDMI input for my Roku, after a few seconds the screen would suddenly and noticeably darken. This was eliminated by turning off the \"Energy Saving\" function (from the Settings / Picture screen).- Another minor disappointment was that this TV only has one cable/Antenna input. Some people (like me) watch cable for cable shows but switch to antenna for network channels in order to experience them in true HD.- I downloaded and tried to update my firmware without success. LG Technical Support recommended that I take it to a local Service Center to figure out what that problem was. I doubt that the firmware update would be necessary for most people.- My MAJOR disappointment was that some distributor web sites (e.g., Fryes) CLAIM that this TV will play video files (avi, mp4, mkv) via the USB port (e.g., from an external hard drive). This claim also \"appears\" to be supported in the TV being DivX Certified. However, this TV does NOT have that functionality (the manual is quite ambiguous on this point, but LG Technical Support was clear). The USB port will only recognize photos and music files. However, most TVs lack this functionality. The way around it is to get a Blu-Ray player with a USB port supporting that capability (there are MANY inexpensive Blu-Ray players (e.g., Samsung) on the market supporting this functionality). If you MUST have that functionality in the TV, check out the LG 32LM6200, the Samsung UN32ES6500FXZA or Samsung UN32EH5300FXZA. These TVs are more high-end and accordingly more expensive.Ultimately, these disappointments wouldn't be noticed by the vast majority of people. Hence, my 4 star rating.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "A.

Nordby", "ReviewID": "RTRIZH2VRKP1B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It would have merited a four or five since everything works well and picture quality is very good except for the following.We went to Wal Mart and looked at all the smaller HDTV's doing side by side comparisons.  The LG's all seemed to have a very bright picture compared to most others for the same or higher price.  It set up and operated easily as advertised but the picture wasn't as bright as in the store.  I have a 24\" Westinghouse HDTV/Monitor in my office, tuned in the same program and looked back and forth to clearly see the LG was not as bright.So I went to the control panel and did the automatic or wizard adjustment for brightness comparing samples, picking the sharpest or brightest one and so forth but it was still the same.  So I  manually adjusted brightness and contrast up near 100% and it was still the same.I doubt if the difference is in the smaller screen size of the Westinghouse, although some friends suggested that.  My wife is happy with it, no one notices except me so its not a problem just a minor disappointment.  Therefore this TV is okay and if it was as bright as the sample in Wal Mart it would be a 4 or 5.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG 32LS3450 32 \"y 720p 60 Hz LED HDTV", "Author": "Morellys Vargas", "ReviewID": "R3HTAF8205FVER", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The TV came with broken screen.

I previously used an older Sony 24 inch analog model with a digital converter for my cable service, and thought I'd finally move up to the digital world.  On the LG, high def broadcasts are only acceptable; anything not broadcast in HD is so poor it's hard to look at.  When you look at the screen it appears that one is viewing the picture under a thin sheet of water.  The color is never on target and the background is never quite in focus.  After a few months the tv began sporadically announcing that there was an audio device connected to the tv and did I wish to enjoy it?  Odd because any audio devices that could connect to the tv were at least 20 feet away in another room.  These messages would start in the middle of a program and would come back repeatedly despite clicking no to the request on the remote; a perfect way to ruin a viewing experience.  When I actually did use audio input for viewing pictures on my digital camera, the pictures or video were even worse than the tv broadcasts.  Fortunately, I moved the old 40 pound Sony to the basement where I can get a tv picture that is far superior in most ways to the new LG LCD tv.  Don't buy this tv; I wish I hadn't.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$349.99", "Features": "1366 X 768p (720p) HD Resolution\nSmart Energy Saving\nInput: 2 HDMI, 1 Component, 1 RCA, 1 PC\nDimensions W/stand (WHD): 29.06\" X 19.72\" X 7.28\"", "Name": "LG 32LS3450 32\" 720p 60Hz LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CnmqmfAYL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0095ZS0WQ"}}
