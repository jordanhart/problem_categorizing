{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A sharp big screen tv at the right price!", "Author": "Jereth", "ReviewID": "RVAVY9FZRKGJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went to Bestbuy with a friend to pick this up using a 10% off coupon (Google the coupon if you need one). We did our research and just wanted to share some information about it. This TV is a great set for the price point of $999.Here are a few things to note.1. To get the calibration setting and additional reviews, head over to Sharp AQUOS LC60LE632U 60-inch 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV, Black. There are identical TV with the exact same screen, so you'll be able to calibrate exactly like it. You NEED to recalibrate it as described over at the other review. The difference is night and day!2. The pictures you see on Amazon.com is incorrect. That image has 4 HDMI ports, and it's an image of the LC60LE630U.3. This LC60LE6300U has only 3 HDMI ports. However, if you need additional ports, get an automatic HDMI switch using the Kinivo 501BN Premium 5 port High speed HDMI switch with IR wireless remote and AC Power adapter - supports 3D, 1080p. The switch will automatically switch to the last activated item. You won't have to mess with additional remote to gain the extra ports.4. The screen is matte, not glossy.5. This TV is edge lit.6. The sound is okay for an average user. I'm not an audiophile or anything, but it sounds... flat. I guess it's nothing you can't fix with a sound bar. Just note that the standard speakers aren't anything great.All in all, if you want a big screen TV and do not want to buy in to the 3D technology right now. Get this! It's worth the price point of $999. I would give this TV a 4.5 out of 5.Update:I see that it's out of stock now on Amazon... I did the review based on the price of $999. If I were to pay $1,267.72 I would have to give it 3.5 stars out of 5.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Srini", "ReviewID": "R13JBBNHHJXIBG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for a good price from HHGreg for $999 and here are my views .Picture Quality: I would give it 3 stars as this TV lacked the crispness i was looking for that my other LG 42 inch had.All sports channels however looked great.With that being said i have seen reviews of other sharp models that required manual caliberation  for an enhanced picture clarity. i have yet to do that.Sound quality : Decent but do not expect a home theater effect.Setup feature : I would give a 5 star with the ease i could set the TV up from the box and a very simplified process.All in All it's good bang for your buck , however if you were to compare it with a Samsung or an LG then be prepared to pay the price for it.Update : After changing the settings as sugessted by the folks at amazon (which is as below) , the clarity and cripness has greatly improved and is on par with a bravia or a samsung.

ROMAN", "ReviewID": "R1C1PW4RL5HY1O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Color Accuracy: (B) Unless you are adventurous enough to go into the service menu, the only options that you have for calibrating color on this set are \"Color,\" \"Tint\" and \"Color Temperature.\"  Even if you want to take the risk and go into service menu territory, you won't be able to change the color settings for HDMI inputs.  Only Component and TV inputs can be adjusted in the service menu.  However, the colors I get adjusting the available settings are very much to my liking.  Since I don't own the testing equipment to properly calibrate color temperature, I just adjust it to what I like the most.  In that sense, I prefer to err on the warmer side (i.e., yellowish whites/grays) rather than the cold side (i.e., bluish whites/grays) and that's a personal preference.  Once you set the color temperature, you can use a calibration disk and blue filter glasses (included in some calibration disks or $2 plus shipping from the THX online store).  Here are my settings:  COLOR: -3  TINT: -0  Under PICTURE SETTINGS ADVANCED  COLOR TEMP: LOWBlack Levels: (F) Here's where this set fails big time.  A good set should be able to display up to 4% below black and this set is unable to display anything below black.  I tried three different calibration disks and different players to rule out any component clipping the signal but the lowest black level that I can see if pure black.  Here I like using the standard pluge pattern from Spears & Munsil.  This pattern is supposed to show you four bars: 4% below, 2% below, 2% above and 4% above black with the brightness setting all the way up.  However, you'll have a hard time seeing even the 2% above black bar.  This aspect is what bothers me the most about this set since the 6-year-old, 42-inch set being replaced blows this one out of the water in black levels. After much trying, below are the settings that are most bearable to me.  Keep in mind that this depends entirely on the black levels in your room.  Do yourself a favor and download the free HD 709 calibration disk from the AVS Forum and set it to the levels that work for your room.  OPC: OFF  BACKLIGHT: 5  CONTRAST: 27  BRIGHTNESS: 8Panel Uniformity: (D) If you do your homework before buying this set, this should not be a surprise.  Even the expensive LED (i.e., local dimming) sets have issues referred as flash lighting or light bleed.  This set is no exception and how much light bleeding you get depends on luck.  I didn't fare well and see three large grey blotches when the Blu-Ray player is in screen-saver mode.  To be honest, this doesn't bother me much because it's not really apparent other than in screen-saver mode.Value: (A+) Here's is where this set gets its highest marks.  If you happen to be one of the lucky people who scored this set at Black Friday prices, you're getting an incredible deal at $1,000.  This is THE reason why I am not returning this set.  Getting any set noticeable better than this one would require at least an extra half a grand.  For something that scores B or above all categories, you'll need three grand in this size range.All things considered, the overall rating will depend on the price point.  At Black Friday prices, the excellent value of this set would push the rating to 4 stars.  However, being that those prices are no longer available, I'm afraid this set doesn't earn more than 3 stars at today's price point.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty darn good for the price.", "Author": "Doc Johnson", "ReviewID": "RS7CSH018QRCW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I realize this is more of a comparison, but I am posting this here and avsforum for those who are in the same boat (debating between an LED like this, or a Plasma).After having this TV for a week, I had to see if I made the right choice...I had to see if motion blur was actually bad compared to what else I could have.I went to Fry's and got a Plasma...  Panasonic TC-P60S30 for $1200.  I decided to put it side by side with my Sharp and return one of them while within the 30 day policy.  Here are my findings:-The color on my Sharp is 'almost' as good as the Plasma.  The plasma is a little more rich, but honestly, the Sharp looks pretty darn good.  For those who claim that they are WAY off, you may want to try the service menu...I was lucky enough to not need to.-The plasma does show more fine detail...on pictures of flowers, there were some shadows and dark contours that I did not notice as much on the sharp.-The sharp has better blacks (which really surprised me!  Plasmas are supposed to have better blacks)...honestly I've never seen a TV with blacks as nice as this sharp.  I don't know how some people claim that the blacks are not good.-The sharp has MUCH better whites.  When bringing up websites with black text on white background, I find myself having a harder time staring at the plasma, and looking back over to the sharp...I think this is due to the plasma's dull whites, and the screen flicker (more on that below).  I don't know if this is common for plasmas...the brightness setting does not handle any sort of backlight on the Panasonic.  I'm not familiar with Plasma technology, but it's as if there is no backlight to adjust.-Input lag:  almost non-existant on both sets, with smoothing on or off.  I was playing Assassin's Creed, and dragging windows around the desktop while taking pictures of both sets MIRRORED (showing the same output from my PC).  Side by side, the image would be just a tiny bit ahead on the plasma, but the difference was so small I don't think it could make a difference for online gaming...it was about what I'd expected comparing a plasma to LCD.-Image blur (ghosting).  This is the main reason I wanted to try a Plasma.  Side by side, the sharp does have more blur than the plasma, but not a TON more.  I noticed a little on the Plasma too.  I notice it quite a bit on the sharp when dragging around text boxes and graphics / windows. The motion smoothing on this Sharp set does NOT do a a great job. However, while watching blu ray animations, I didn't notice the issue on either set...more so during PC use, and sometimes during gaming.-Screen flicker:  Obviously non-existant on the LED sharp...no LCD screens have this issue.  I didn't realize Plasmas have it, but they do.  And a minority of people (myself included) can see it...Plasmas really do operate at 60hz.  600 is a marketing gimmick...something about 10x60hz...not sure how they justify it.  Most people will never see this issue on a plasma, but to me...I feel like I'm staring at an old CRT at 60hz...I don't think I can use the plasma for web browsing because of the flicker, and the lack of WHITE color on the screen...just easier to read on the Sharp after staring for long periods.-So far, I'm thinking I will return the Panasonic Plasma, and keep the Sharp.  They both have their ups and downs.  This comparison helped me to feel justified in the $1,000 price for the sharp.  I'll give it a few more days before I make my final decision.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Spend a bit more and get a better TV.", "Author": "Steven", "ReviewID": "R2CC5W27LK0CHM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV on BF from Sears and really wanted to keep it since price was outstanding. It had a couple large background \"clouds\" that were visible under normal room lighting conditions, during dark movie scenes. That was something that I expected after reading reviews, so I didn't make big deal out of it. When I looked at it initially, picture quality was really impressive, especially for me, since I was upgrading from old projection TV. My biggest problem was greenish tint to the picture that was impossible to correct since this TV has very limited color adjustment options. I tried all settings that were posted here and on AVS forum but couldn't get colors right. People's faces were greenish, grass was \"toxic green\", I just couldn't stand it. Some TV owners on AVS got into the service menu to get colors corrected but even then there is no color adjustment on HDMI inputs. If this TV would have proper color adjustment options and I would get green tint under control I'd keep it. I ended up returning 60LE6300U TV and got 60LE632U instead. I've read reviews on 60LE632U before getting it, and they overwhelmingly positive. My experience with 60LE632U is also good. It doesn't have extreme clouding like my 6300 did, there is only one 5\" spot that slightly visible when switching inputs in a total dark but never during viewing. It has a wealth of color control options that allow adjust colors for anyone's viewing preference. Even out of the box colors looked good but I'll tinker with them when time allows.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Huge screen, but colors are not so good", "Author": "Nicholas V", "ReviewID": "R3BHNQE05YAZSR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got this from a brick and mortar store nearby. Been fiddling with it for days, but cannot get the color accuracy under control. I have an older 52\" Sharp as well, but since its picture quality is way better, this set will probably go back to the store.Pros:huge screen, great price, decent picture *if* you can ignore the color accuracyCons:lacks color channel adjustments, has a weird and seemingly one-off menu not found on other Sharp 60\" and aboveEDIT--Added a picture I took of the weird user interface/one-off menu on the product page. Please see product page images.The major failing here is that you CANNOT adjust the color channels independently. You are limited to using only the archaic Brightness, Contrast, Color, Tint. It's a HUGE screen for your money, but the picture quality suffers because unlike all the other 60\"+ models that Sharp has available, the menus on this one are atrocious and omit the all-important \"CMS Hue\" and \"CMS Saturation\" options. For some reason, Sharp chose a non-standard user interface for this model that looks completely different from the other models I've seen. The result is awful color reproduction. I'm going to have to agree with another reviewer (blink). You get what you pay for, in this instance.I suppose you could hire a professional calibrator to fix these problems via the service menu, but you could also spend that money on a TV with better menu options instead.Read more about this TV in the avsforum owner's thread. So far, reviews are mixed. For some people, picture is either too dark (crushed blacks, etc), or the greens are way too bright (toxic sludge!). And there's no way to dial it in further because of the lack of color channel adjustments.Also, if you have a Logitech Harmony remote, you will have to learn the On/Off command and reconfigure the remote so it cycles through the inputs instead of sending out signals for each input (Power and Input3-8 signals from the Logitech database are broken -- EDIT: Input3 (HDMI3) does not work, but the inputs after may work -- Thanks, Joel McCotter)The Disney WOW Blu-ray disc is arriving from Amazon tomorrow, so I'll see if I can improve the colors, but I'm not holding out much hope.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bigger is not always Better", "Author": "jeff bowden", "ReviewID": "R2EBZUU2PDMERC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This unit suffers from two problems that make it a dealbreaker for me.  The first is that it does not do a good job with anything less than 1080p, which i attribute mostly to its massive size.  That said, other brands dont have as much blur.  It is reminiscent of standard def on say a 32 inch tv.  It just doesnt look special.The second issue is the menu adjustments are very basic, there is no independent r,g,b adjustments, so when you try to dial in a glossy picture by reducing brightness, you are going to have red faces or lime green grass.  The sister models have these adjustments, so why Sharp left them off is 60LE6300U my understanding.You do get a large picture at a bargain price, but to me, you give up the best benefit of hd, being the window-like quality.  Cartoons and videogames are awesome, bluray are great, football is a real letdown because of the \"green push\" that sales people love. It looks great in the store, but needs to be dialed down at home.

Subjectively I must admit, I'm going from a SD Hitachi 32\" TV so ANYTHING looks better almost than that.I have a few friends with 50\" Sonys and Samsungs.  This is, as shown on the Product page, significantly bigger than a 55\".  The picture is excellent and the sound is adequate for watching normal TV sitcoms.  I've adjusted the picture according to the settings on another review and that made a nice difference in quality.  All in all it is on the same level as a Sony or Samsung.  3 HDMI is not a big deal since I only need one for cable, one for my Media Player and still have one left for my Blu-ray.Shipping was Quick and in great condition out of the box.  Unpacking probably should be done by 2 people since the TV is ackwardly large,(I did it solo but I can see how others would have a problem with the heft getting it out of the box and installed.)Only Negative I have so far is the sound at times is out of sync with the picture, a split second off of the picture the other day when watching a HD NFL game.  Not a huge deal though if you hook it up to a System that has a ms delay circuit.THE EXACT DIMENSIONS ON THE TV WITHOUT THE STAND ARE 54 1/2\" WIDE X 33\" TALL.  I know it says 34.3\" tall but that is with the TV stand.  In case your looking for a Stand....As a side note watch out on the size on this TV.  It makes it a little difficult to find a TV cabinet (if your not mounting on the wall).  We redecorate often and have Cable jacks in each corner so we wanted a TV Hutch that could hold it, mounted to the back of the hutch.  After much searching I think I've found one and I ordered the \"South Shore Cakao Chocolate TV Stand and Hutch, for TVs up to 60\" and it should arrive in a few days.  When I get it all set up I'll update my review since this is one of the only Sub-$1000 TV Hutches around that I could find (around $300 shipped)UPDATE.. This TV fits perfectly in the South Shore Cakao TV Stand and Hutch.

I basically ran the EZ setup and selected the \"store\" location in the menu.  I figured Sharp would use their most impressive configuration to wow folks into buying the TV in the store.  Why not run that same config at home?My issue is with the sound.  I own an Onkyo receiver that doesn't have HDMI ports (my system sounds great so why should I give it up).  I tried running optical out of the TV to the optical port on my receiver-no sound.  Called Sharp tech support-the Aquos Advantage folks (which felt like a disadvantage after several calls).  This model does not pass sound through the optical port for anything that is fed via HDMI.  So if you're running a PS3/BD Player/Cable box through ur TV with HDMI, you're only option for sound into an older receiver is RCA. Something you should know if you don't plan on upgrading your HT sound system just yet. This really gets under my skin, especially since the native sound on the TV is terrible.Still up in the air on whether I am going to keep this or not.  If I can get a better quality TV minus five inches of screen real estate-and somewhere in the same price neighborhood-I may consider other options.Update (12/1/11): Upgraded the firmware to 2.0 on TV last night.  No new features in menu.  Still getting no sound out of the optical port. Returning TV.Update (12/2/11): Checked out owner thread over at avs forum ([...]). Mixed reviews but many people have been having the same issues that several folks have cited here-no sound from optical, no control over RGB, poor image quality.Update (12/15/11): Finally returned this TV and picked up a Vizio XVT553SV for around the same price on sale at Sams Club.  Sams also has the Sharp LC60LE633U (the 632U with 240hz refresh rate)-which is the much better sibling of the 6300U-on sale.

This TV has the most amazing picture I have ever seen on a TV this size.  we upgraded from a 42inch LCD LG TV and oh boy is this an upgrade.  I h ave to say though, it does take some getting used to, as the quality is almost TOO GOOD!  when watching a movie in HD or BlueRay it looks as though you are looking out a window into the real world, and does not look like a movie.  you can see every single imperfection on the camera work due to the high refresh-rate and overall quality.  My recommendation is to turn off the power saving mode, as it will change perioditcally throughout the movie and can be a bit annoying, I change it to movie mode for movies (albiet a bit darker than I would like....we usually tweak the backlight a bit and its perfect).  the sound is actually very good considering how thin this TV is.  thew sound is twice as loud as our 42inch LG, but really; who buys a TV like this and does not upgrade with a soundbar or sound-system???  TYhe screen does not glare hardly at all with the amazing screen quality where as with our LG we would not be able to fully enjoy anytyhing if the light was shining in around 5pm from our window way up high that has no blinds (its about 20 ft. up so...kind of have to just deal...Anyways, I would recommend this tv to anyone who is a gamer, movie buff, and who is not so much into the 3D thing...(*and really, the 3D thing is awesome, but when you have more than 2-4 people watching a movie...is not really an option anyways, I would much prefer the IMAX expierence anyways.  movies like UP and Shrek look absolutly flawless on this TV.  Only drawback is the \"too real\" look with some movies, but after getting used to it, you come to appreciate it and other tv's just look cheap and horrible quality.  Overall I give this TV 5 stars, for the price it is the best TV you can find...in my opinion just as good as if you where to buy a 3000.00 TV at the same size...maybe with a few less bells and whistles...where it counts (picture quality) it performs exceptionally well!!!", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Charles Law", "ReviewID": "R1QMA8TAYVLBQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this tv a week ago.  At first I was very disappointed.  As 1 reviewer pointed out it doesn't work well with analog inputs.  I had it connected to a wii, and the darks all blended together and the picture looked blurry.  I tried the recommended settings with no luck.I suspected it might have been the analog RGB inputs so I hooked it up to a bluray player.  As soon as I turned it all on I was blown away.  I put in a calibration disk (there is a free one online at avsforums, just google free avs calibration disc), then watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  To my surprise, the dark scenes looked great.  I could make out all the detail, unlike with the analog inputs.  The bright scenes looked great too as I expected them too.  Also the colors looked awesome.  The quality is definitely comparable to what you get from a Sony or Samsung.Also, the 1 reason I hesitated about getting the TV was because it was edge lit.  I kept an eye out for any bleeding around the edges, but there are no issues here.  And even though there isn't any local dimming, the blacks are very deep.  It's really a quality TV.Overall, I would give this TV a 4/5, only because of the bad looking analog inputs, specifically for playing the Wii.  That's not considering the price.  Digital inputs are perfect, and this TV itself looks great on the wall.  You can't beat it for the price.One last note.  I am buying a wii hd calble.

I do not have cable television or any other components other than my computer which is what I use it with (you don't need any other components these days!). I have used several other large HDTV's as my monitor and they were amazing but I've had to part with them for some reason or another.The color just flat out sucks. Doing graphics is out of the question. Watching movies is a horrible experience because shadows are almost completely black. Like around a persons eyes - you can't see their eyes because it is almost completely BLACK. Lighting effects are absolutely horrible. Playing games? Unless I change my video card's profile to an annoyingly bright setting forget it. Again in games shadowed areas are just BLACK.The remote lags. That is very frustrating. Sometimes you have to hit the button you want the TV to react to several times and it takes up to 10 seconds for it to actually do it on the screen no matter how close you are to it.Using the buttons ON the TV to navigate is also very frustrating because they're so close together with no \"brail\" like indentation or raised nipple or something on it you end up hitting the wrong button and either screwing up what you're trying to do, powering it off, or going to another sub-menu.I have tried several different video cards. It's not my computer. Like I said I've used large screen HDTV's as my monitor before and it was an amazing experience all around. Not with this thing!I have mine financed so I'm stuck with it and the place I got it from refuses to replace it with a better television. They accepted taking it back for 2 weeks to have their technicians look at it, they didn't admit finding anything wrong with it (probably because they see what I'm saying and don't want to give me something better even though I'm a good customer that pays my financing before it's due). I don't blame the company I got it from for the issues. I blame the quality of this tv. It just isn't good quality and doesn't have a good, quality, picture.I would advise people considering this item to keep shopping. There are much better 60\" flat panels.I gave it a 2 only because of it's massive size and it is edge lit.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "A bad experience", "Author": "J. PARK", "ReviewID": "R33WUVBVNTCOX0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered mine online from Costco for roughly the same price advertised here.  It was not DOA but it had a peculiar habit of winking (going black, eventually coming back) from the very first day.  By the third day, we were watching the Denver Broncos vs Chicago Bears game and it became unbearable.  It would also totally black out and I had to unplug and re-plug to get it to come on.  It happened so often that I am sure that it exceeded the number of fingers on my hands.  Finally had enough and replaced it with the original 42\" Vizio that it was supposed to replace.When we first got it, we were able to watch a blu-ray of Cars 2 and the picture was amazing.  I don't recall any problems during the entire length of the movie.  One problem I did have was getting ClearType on my computer working well with the extra large screen.  After a number of tries, I could still see color tints to the text on the screen.  My wife thought the screen was too bright or hard on the eyes especially when I was on your standard white Google search page.  I had tried applying a firmware patch without effect.Taking it back for store credit was a chore.  I had to disassemble the stand from the HDTV in order to fit it into the back of our RAV4.  My wife had to drive because we needed all the space on the driver's side we could get to fit the TV and the original packing materials in.  With the additional help of my son, we were able to finally lug it back and get the credit.We wound up replacing with a Samsung 55\" which was a lot easier to deal with, was significantly lighter and was packed tighter.  It cost us a little more than we paid for the Sharp 60\" but it came with one extra HDMI port, built-in apps and a better RGB picture.  I didn't need to fiddle with the ClearType settings.My wife is totally turned off of Sharp products now.  I think it was just one of those things.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the price after calibration", "Author": "K3PIO", "ReviewID": "R3TH1SC6006GQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I would like to thank other reviewers for helping me with my find of this TV.  I did not buy it at amazon but from \"dell\" since I got the gift card deal.  I was skeptical at first but took a chance and came out on top like a bandit.For the black Friday price, this became a no brainer and a bargain.  I got a WD TV streaming media player that also streams MKV files.  I have watched all kinds of football, basketball games and blu ray on this TV.  I would say the price of the TV turned out to be too cheap for the features offered.I went to PC Richards to compare a wide array of LED TVs including the 240 Hz.  For HD TV signal every TV is pretty much the same.  If you have not noticed, there is \"no\" HD TV signal yet that will avoid the blurry pictures when the camera is far away from the object.  i.e watch a foot ball or basketball game and when they show the players far away and if you get close to the TV, the individual guys in the shot will be blurry.  I talked to the guy on the floor and even he said that there is no HD signal yet that would erase out the far shot blurriness and requires billions of dollars in investment.  I even went to SAMSUNG show room here in NYC and the same outcome with the games.  So in the end every TV now seems to be very similar \"except\" for the hyped up features that get advertised which obviously comes at a price.  As technology improves everything will get better, \"but\" if the signal feed is not perfected what good is the top of the line TV?For people who claim imperfections with this TV, do the calibrations.  As far as the AUDIO sound is concerned, I am content as I probably live in a space with 8-16 feet viewing distance and sound is good enough for me.  For people who complain about the sound, if you are young in the 20s-30s, go to a doctor and get your ears checked since you will only get older and will not be able to hear and you may have a hearing problem.  Unless you spend on top of the line BOSE sound, no sound will be good enough as I have read complaints with a lot of sound bars as well.  Where does the complaining end?  Considering I only spent about $900 to buy this, I will save the money on the sound bar for now and get a better TV in the future as the signal and technology improve.In the end, this was a steal of a lifetime unless you were very quick on very rare deals I saw for Black Friday.Using the calibration mentioned in the previous reviews, the pictures are at par with the top of the line TVS.
