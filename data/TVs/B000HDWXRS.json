I wanted something low profile that could serve as both a large pc monitor and also that I could watch TV on.  This unit has been perfect!  In addition to filling my original requirements, I've also joined the High-def world after installing a HD DVR from my cable provider.  The picture quality is fantastic.The only downside to this unit is the poor sound of the speakers.  Fortunately, I had an old stereo receiver and speakers in my garage to hook up to.So, if you have a way to improve the sound, I highly recommend this unit.", "Date": "September 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice monitor with crisp picture", "Author": "Graphixman", "ReviewID": "R3EH3RN3Z5CTBH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I agree with everyone else who has chipped in and stated that the sound quality is sadly lacking. However after doing a lot of research and store visits looking at similar televisions, I thought this was a great deal and bought one. The price was the best so far especially taking into consideration features, and hookups that are available. It was purchased on sale at Best Buy for $299.  I bought this for a small extra bedroom, that I use also for my computer. The size was perfect, and can be wall mounted to save even more room. The screen is crisp, and bright, with a lot of adjustments you can make to suit your tastes. In order to make up for the poor sound quality, I have a decent pair of computer speakers with a subwoofer that hook directly into the back of the TV in an external jack. ( Like I believe they designed it for )  I gave it 4 stars directly for the poor sound, but the other stars are solid for the picture quality.********** Update *********** 12/19/2006Important update,  Ok a day and a half after getting this TV, I had to return it as it all of a sudden developed a \"White screen of Death\" This item worked flawlessly and then \"POOF\" stopped. All that existed was a white screen, no snow, not black, just white and blank. I took it back, and exchanged it for another, which has surpassed the day and a half test :-) and so far so good works as it should.", "Date": "December 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Bad Sound", "Author": "SunnySD", "ReviewID": "RI7II1KHXQX1Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "These reviews saved me a lot of trouble.  My housemate bought this TV last week.  She thought maybe the sound was so bad because the feed was coming  from the cable instead of through the digital box, as my TV does.  She had asked me to try connecting hers to the digital box to see if that would improve the sound.  Instead I checked here first.

Many have complained about the speaker's audio quality, I do not disagree.  However my solution was to plug in $15 speakers into the Audio out- problem solved.

LCD could only cycle through the monitor inputs and not the video or cable inputs. So basically instead of being a TV it was just an overpriced monitor. I sent it back to TigerDirect and they said they would give me a complete refund. Picture quality was good for the price and the size was great for my needs. I wish it actually worked as advertised. I will never order electronics online over $200 ever again. What a dissapointment especially having to wait two weeks to receive it overseas, finding out that its defective, and then wait another 2 - 4 weeks to get my refund. Also the couple of hours I spent troubleshooting thinking it was user error was a serious headache. I would definitely order from TigerDirect again since these things do happen.

It honestly has a great picture, but the audio is so unbearably bad that I don't even know why they bothered the put speakers on it.  However it does have a headphone jack audio-out so you can easily hook up a small set up speakers.  I used a 3 piece cambridge soundworks system and it works just great.  If you can get a deal on this TV, just group in a pair of speakers with it.  External speakers are almost always better than TV speakers anyways.Another complaint I had is that the remote doesn't seem to work well.  The power button eventually stopped working.  I took it apart and there was nothing spilled on it or obstructing the contacts - it is just poor quality I guess.The TV channels also seem to switch annoyingly slow when using the built in tuner.  You can obviously get around this by using a digital cable box.I would only reccomend this TV if you get an EXCEPTIONAL deal on it.
