{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony reliability now at a Samsung price.", "Author": "Samuel Chell", "ReviewID": "R2QCXPS6CNWMNL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the V-Series Sony 40\" LCD set immediately preceding this model.  Based on my experience with the earlier model, I've recommended the KDL 40V4100 to friends and family. The differences: 1. When the 40V4000 first came out, it was being sold for as much as twice the price of this one; 2. the previous model had 10- bit color processing (which now is available only on the more expensive Z or later series).  Although 120Hz is now the rage (available beginning with the W series), Sony's unique 24 fps Movie True mode is likely to make a more noticeable difference in \"smoothening out\" camera movement than 120Hz capability (which is primarily a come-on for the gamers and \"Matrix\" generation).For under $1500, this is the set I would unhesitatingly select ahead of a comparable Samsung (you can get the price down to around $1000 if you go with the S series, but you'll sacrifice Sony's acclaimed Bravia 2 processor as well as Sony's auto-link feature permitting operation of all components with a single switch).  If I were willing to spend close to $2000 or more, I would look at a 46\"-52\" Sony with 120 Hz (just to be current) and 10-bit color processing for a hi-def picture that simply leaves nothing to be desired.  I would also do everything possible to purchase from Amazon. (I had to make two exchanges before ending up with the \"right\" model, and Amazon as usual made both hassle-free transactions.) Also, be sure to check out Amazon Warehouse for a \"refurb\" or \"scratch and dent\" model.  I've never been disappointed in any of these items at reduced prices, or even noticed any difference from mint.A couple of things learned through experience: 1. A flat-panel set does not \"play\" as large as the old tube models.  If you formerly required a 27\" convection tube screen, you'll need 32\"-40\" to enjoy a similar viewing experience with an LCD flat screen.  2. When watching HDTV telecasts (still only a small percentage of channels), it's quite likely you'll notice little to no difference from standard definition if the screen is less than 40\".  So if you're planning on purchase of a 36\" or smaller screen, skip the extras. 720p is more than adequate, and most of the other frills can be regarded as needless extra expense.  Also, SD (standard definition) will look better on any small screen than on the most expensive manufacturer's large screen models, so make price--not brand name--the primary criterion when selecting a screen under 40\".", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Superb Picture (except the static dot sparkles see text), Good Value", "Author": "EP in TX", "ReviewID": "R1FHDPGN7T91GL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have had my 40V4100 a month now. Had originally wanted the \"W\" with 120 Hz but this \"V\" was on sale locally making the difference $600.  I do not regret buying this 60 Hz set, and saving hundreds of dollars. Overall it is excellent after getting the picture settings adjusted to my liking. Audio quality from the built-in speakers is surprisingly good with the Dynamic mode ON and some extra bass and treble. I do have a minor problem that seems to be common to this new line of Sony LCD TVs - intermittent tiny bright white dots that appear randomly across the picture in a straight line, just a few at a time,  about 4\" below the top of the picture, in HDMI mode only. Most noticeable on dark or black scenes. I almost exchanged the set for another one,  until I saw the same white dots on a 40V4100 at the store playing a Blu-Ray disc. So far Sony's support does not seem to recognize the problem. I hope Sony will pay attention to what their customers are telling them and come up with a fix for this ASAP because it can be quite noticeable on HDMI upcsaled DVD or Blu-Ray sources. If not for that I would rate it a 5.EDIT and UPDATE! Sept 14, 2008 - I am happy to report that Sony has come through and addressed the white dot sparkle problem with an easy to use software/firmware update via a USB flash drive they sent. I now have ZERO white dot sparkles, and a perfect picture. Excellent!

The only major flaws are \"flashlighting\" near the corners of the screen and an annoying backlight dimming (even with the Advanced Contrast Enhancer disabled). However, these are only really noticeable during completely black scenes and have not bothered me during regular viewing.Sound: 5 of 5The sound is loud and clear considering the small size of the speakers and the S-Force Front Surround actually works well. This set is much better than my previous Samsung LCD which had weak sound and created an annoying echo at times.Inputs: 5 of 5This set has 4 HDMI (version 1.3) inputs, allowing you to connect several high definition sources. The side inputs are also useful for connecting digital or video cameras. The only downside is the lack of a USB port offered on other comparable sets.Miscellaneous: 5 of 5The gloss black finish and clear space between the screen and speakers give the set a slim and open look. The menu is easy to navigate and looks nice. I also like the 24p TrueCinema which provided a smoother picture with movie content.

Actually, for me it was my first flat panel as well since I am currently still watching 1080p DLP.So, for the very first time I found myself a bit uneducated between buying an LCD and a PLASMA.  Since I run a Home Theater website I go to electronic shows every year and see both plasmas and LCD televisions side-by-side.  I always thought they looked good, but never got a real education in the true differences.Since my Mother watches television in a sunken living room with windows I thought an LCD set would be really good for her.  They are supposed to perform better in brighter rooms.  Plus, I was afraid to go PLASMA for fear that she might create burn-in if she was not careful with what she watched.I went with the Sony KDL-41V4100.  Thought it was the best bang for the buck.  First, it's got the Sony stamp on it and the BRAVIA engine that really cleans up standard definition signals.Upon setting up the Sony LCD and turning it on, I was surprised to see how good the picture actually looked, particularly black levels.  Now LCD is not supposed to recreate black levels very well, but from what I saw on this display, I was rather amazed. Sound output from this unit was also impressive from this very stylish television.The problems began as I watched more material.  I started seeing jagged action in fast-moving images.  Once I saw it, I was able to continue seeing it and it really began bothering me.  Apparently, this is a common problem with LCD unless you go with the W series. Additionally, the moment I move to side seating in my viewing area the picture quality degraded.  As has been reported, LCD quality degrades as you move out of direct view.Additionally, the TV came out of the box defective.  There was a permanent white blotch on the screen that appeared when the set was powered on and anytime there was blackness in the picture (such as changing inputs).  Found out this defect is caused by styrofoam or some other object pressing against the screen during shipping.Then there were the numerous Internet reports about \"sparkling\" and \"cloud\" issues on the Sony LCD displays.  Do a Google search and you will see what I mean.I really wanted to stay with Sony and LCD -- especially since it was going to be in the delicate hands of my Mother. But you know what?  Once you get a defective set and see problems in the picture quality you don't want to go back.So, I am moving on to PLASMA despite the drawbacks with that format.  Actually, PLASMA gives you the best black levels as well as superior color reproduction.  LCD comes close, but not quite.  You also get a wide viewing angle.The only drawback with PLASMA is that you have to baby it for a while.  It needs to be broken in slowly and you have to be careful about keeping static images on the screen.  Of course, everyone is saying image burn-in on PLASMA is a thing of the past, but it pays to be careful nonetheless.Sorry, but this expert was not convinced that LCD provides the best picture possible which is what I was striving for.  Sony also has some issues to resolve with this particular series that doesn't begin or end with my experience.  Again, do a search and you will see others have issues as well.", "Date": "December 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Tried 5+ brands. this is the best", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R1H3AAL31NK9YI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this TV for 2 month now.

The two main things that drew me to this model are the SteadySound (volume leveling) and built in video upconversion features.The SteadySound could be a bit more aggressive in limiting the dynamic range of the volume, but I'm being picky there, and nobody else has the feature at all, nearly as I can tell.  It's really nice not to have car dealer ads blare at me when it goes to commercial (do they *really* think that makes us *more* likely to buy from them?).I could not be more pleased with the image quality on this set.The way I see it, for now, and probably some time to come, most television channels will be SD.  Even after the switchover I expect that to be the case.  Because of that, I was most interested in a set that would not look crummy with an SD feed.This set fills the bill.  Yes, full up HD feeds do look much better than SD feeds do, but for the most part even SD feeds look even better on this set than they did on the CRT it replaced.It's a kick to see even my old VHS tapes looking great, and it's nice to be able to contentedly wait for prices on Blu-Ray players to drift down out of nose-bleed territory.For reference, I am a pretty techno-savvy fellow, but I also haven't read the manual for this set, only referenced it via its index a few times to understand things on the menu that weren't self-explanatory.

Then I found out that the Sony Service Facility here in Burbank, CA no longer exists.  They have other locations, but they don't service consumer products.

My heart immediately sank as this was the dreaded Bravia clouding, or mura, effect I'd read so much about. In other words the backlighting is not completely consistent at all places of the screen and it showed anywhere from black to very dark purple in dark scenes. This is a common problem that a large percentage of the Bravia and XBR Lcds have problems with. Do a google search on \"Bravia clouding\" for more information.To be fair, it was barely noticeable while watching a normal \"lit\" TV of movie scene, and my girlfriend was completely oblivious to it... But in the black screen pause between channels, dark scenes, and movie credits this purple blob stood out to me like a 14\" Lucky Charms marshmallow-- taunting me for throwing away my hard earned cash...From what I found online, Sony won't officially recognize this as a defect, and exchanging it for another would have been expensive (for shipping). I decided to try and fix it, and it worked! And while it worked for me, it probably won't work for everyone and you could potentially ruin your TV.  Be very careful! The thin plastic screens are fragile and you could scratch or permanently discolor it. I took a very clean and soft microfiber cloth, and with the TV on a dark paused screen began to *very lightly* massage the discolored area in circular motions--just enough to make a discolored spot where I touched it. Within 30 seconds I managed to move the spot near the bottom.  Eventually I was able to keep moving it towards the lower edge until the spot disappeared entirely!  And after two days it hasn't come back.Even if it doesn't work, the picture settings you choose can help lessen this effect as well, especially if you lower your backlight and enable the power saver mode.  The initial picture settings out of the box are just terrible with a harsh blue tint and far too much contrast and picture. I would recommend something closer to this for normal viewing: Mode=Std, Backlight=4, picture=75, bright=50, color=50, hue=R1, temp=warm2, sharpness=10, noise/mpeg=low, and turn off all advanced settings. Search google for more recommendations or just play around with it some until you find what works best for your use.Once the picture was adjusted the picture was beautiful-- even better than my new 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma. Blacks are deep black, whites are bright and clear, and HD content especially shines. Standard definition content looks ok, but the issues there are probably more the signal quality coming in than the TV.  I personally do not notice much of a difference between 60 and 120hz. So I wouldn't let that scare you off. Also the sound is better than I was expecting.  Certainly good enough for day-to-day TV watching.I guess my only reservations, besides the fixed clouding, are the remote isn't my favorite. At this price I would have liked a better feel and light up buttons. Also the menu system is like a Sony PSP--not very user friendly to me. But those are nitpicking... This is a considered a \"budget\" model for Sony, but for the price you get quite high picture and sound quality, making this a very impressive value.

The picture is flawless. I am using the Dish Network ViP722 connected with HDMI. I have noticed no \"sparkles\" or artifacts of any kind. My locals received with an over the air anntena are flawless as well. As a note, I an using the ViP722 OTA input, and not the TV's tuner. SD channels look good as well.My SD DVD player displays well on the TV, but I have noticed some distortion on letters and words during opening and ending credits on some movies. I am positive that is due to the limitations of my DVD player, so I have an upconverting DVD player on order. BluRay is out of my current price point. I did connect my PC to the TV using the VGA connection, played a DVD, and sat in awe so I know that new life will be given to my DVD collection. I also played a level of Crysis and that was an awesome experience. I told my wife that I had found my new PC monitor, but she kindly asked me to put the computer back in the other room :(I can not evaluate the TV's speakers because I have an audio receiver running my sound, but I am using the Tosslink audio out connection to my audio receiver and that works flawlessly.The TV's menu is set up nicely, and the aspect and picture options are easily changed with the press of a button on the remote without having to access the menu.I'll end my review by saying this---Awesome TV!", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "TV color distortion after 4 years.", "Author": "slickmik \"slickmik\"", "ReviewID": "R1X9DOX0MD4U4B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "TV worked fine until today, four years from date of purchase.
