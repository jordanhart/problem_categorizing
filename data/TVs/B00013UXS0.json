{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LG Delivers on its promises", "Author": "Gregory J. Dedominick", "ReviewID": "R1J8P629486T55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been eyeing the LED market for a year in preparation to replace by HD Projection TV I bought back in 2003. Samsung was first on my list, but after some independent reviews (CNET, Consumer Reports), I decided to go with LG. This unit has all the bells and whistles at a competitive price point ($1,800 at the time of purchase) and the LG brand is gaining a good reputation.I was concerned about damage during delivery after reading the only other post on Amazon at the time I ordered, but the unit came in a timely manner and the person delivering insisted on opening the box and looking the unit over before requesting my acceptance. While I can see how the stand could possibly damage the front of the TV if significant force was put on the front of the box, my delivery had no issues.Granted, I had not formally seen the display on this specific model when I purchased it. I had seen the 55LE5400 in local stores, but the 55LE5500 was purchased sight unseen. I could not be more thrilled with what I got. I have the TV in a large room with lots of Florida sunlight. A minor tilt of the TV on the wall unit and I have no significant glare. The image displayed on the screen is great. High Def channels are pristine. Low Def channels, while they do show some blocky edges at times, are more than adequate. (The only Low Def channel we need if for some children's shows and the quality is more than enough for my 2 year old.)There are plenty of display controls to fine tune the screen for your room. The widgets are nice, but I wouldn't consider them a reason to pick this unit over another. 240Hz was one aspect I thought I wanted, but the TruMotion 120Hz on this unit has kept up with any fast panning motions displayed. The Clear Voice aspect has been great for late night TV watching when you want to hear the dialog, but don't need the booming car crashes to wake up the sleeping family. Overall I am thrilled with my purchase. I can clearly see the benefit of LED and LG has delivered on its promises. I would recommend this TV without hesitation.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Could not be more pleased", "Author": "RTBIO", "ReviewID": "R2UCDJG23NASJZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of looking around before I made this purchase.  To me, I thought the LG and Samsung models were the most consistent from store to store. Both have an excellent picture. It comes down to whether you prefer the glossy (Samsung) or matte (LG). I'll admit the glossy displays can look clearer under some circumstances, but reflections are an issue.  I chose LG.I saw more of the LE5400 in stores but decide to go with this model when a great price came along. No regrets there at all. The display is awesome with HD and Blu-Ray. The SD is better than my 46\" Toshiba. Noticeably better. There is some ghosting when the screen is completely black, it doesn't bother me. With fast action scenes you forget you're watching a television, it's so natural.One great feature I like about the set is the self-calibration process. Piece of cake. I have an AppleTV so I have not tried the streaming features yet. It's a downer that you have to buy a wireless dongle.My delivery from Modia was great. There is a review here that disses the LG packaging and it scared me somewhat. I honestly can't figure out what the guy is talking about. Apparently he has some type of ax to grind with LG or he's a Sony dealer or something.LG makes a great LED for a great price. I would highly recommend the 55LE5500.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing tv", "Author": "Jayso", "ReviewID": "R2H5C2S1F1LPBZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I first looked into buying a new tv i looked into led, lcd, and plasma, and obviously decided on led. When I bought this tv i was actually interested in the samsung b8000 55\", but once I found out it was pulled by samsung I got worried about future problems and getting parts for a tv that was discontinued.  I must say that the 55lg5500 was amazing for the price. I paid $1800 for it new at a retail store and I got the five year warranty for 199, and I must say that this tv delivers.  The picture with dish network HD was so clear I couldn't believe it, the features are nice, the games are lame, but the adjustable picture controls work fantastically.  I have a new sony blu ray on the way, never watched a blu ray movie, but I can't wait. This is a great buy", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Romel H. Gobunsuy", "ReviewID": "R2HEG378I2J4DM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this TV! Cannot beat the price. I was going back and forth between this one and the Samsung UN55C6500 and the Vizio xvt553sv. Same function but what made me get this one is the price. For less than $1600 I got the TV, LG bluray player and the wireless usb. The vizio was not as thin as either the LG or the SamsungTWO issues:1-First TV that was delivered was damaged. The left lower corner was cracked. I called the seller and they sent a replacement right away.2-The replacement TV did not work after the software updated. [As soon as you insert the wireless USB the tv will automatically update]. I called LG and they sent a tech, unfortunately next availability was 3 days later! They changed the main board and the power supply. Worked perfectly after!Is this THE best TV? NO.Is this THE best TV for the price?

Luther \"Talon Warlok\"", "ReviewID": "R9SOGFVV5CY6J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is multi-purpose - TV / PC monitor / XBOX Screen. It has HDMI ports (4), RYW ports (3), RGB (2), Fiber Optic Audio, PC ports (2), USB (2), and several others. More than any normal person could ever hope to fill. The picture quality is - in a word - STUNNING. Clear, bright, and enough contrast levels to have both pure black and white on the screen at the same time, not some faded out grays. When the border of the TV and the picture are the same black you know they got it right. LG got it perfect on this one. I am sold on LG, I tried Sanyo and Sony, I looked at several others but this one called out from across the store. Picture was better, sound was better, and most importantly the price was better. I don't regret this purchase ever. Of all the TV's I've owned this is my favorite.

I did a lot of research to buy an LED TV and at the end I knew I wanted a LG. This is a 2010 model that comes with a lot of good features. The picture quality with the HD channels is really good, and with the standard ones is ok.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor local dimming", "Author": "BCorso", "ReviewID": "R3LDS84TSNXL1R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Order this TV without researching it too much, it was on sale for $1600 and came with the LG wireless adapter, LG wall mount, and a LG blu-ray player.The first TV I received had several areas on the screen that were brighter than the rest, most noticeably when the screen was all black. I called Paul's TV and they said they would send me a replacement.The second TV arrived a week later, but this one was also flawed. It was unable to properly process a 1080p signal from my PS3. The screen would flicker on and off for 2 to 3 seconds every 5 to 10 minutes. At first, I thought it was the HDMI cable, but even after using a Monster M1000HD; the problem was still there. The only way to get around this issue was to set the PS3 output to 1080i. I called LG, they had me check a few settings, unplug and reset the TV, and then told me that the TV was defective. So I called Paul's TV again and just asked for my money back.Even when the TV was working, I did notice that the local dimming was pretty horrible. It was obvious the TV was edge lit with dark scenes, the local dimming caused large amounts of stray illumination and blooming into dark areas. It was so distracting that I had to turn off the local dimming and give up on having the deep black levels.I decided to go with a plasma this time and ordered a Samsung PN58C8000 (hasn't arrived yet). After researching, it seems plasmas out perform LED-LCD TVs. If you do get a LED-LCD, I would highly recommend that you get one that is full-array with local dimming instead of the edge-lit; it will help eliminate the stray illumination and blooming into dark areas.", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not happy with overall quality of this TV...", "Author": "J.

Overall, the TV looked nice but felt very cheap. It was heavier than it sounded in the listing and the picture quality was not that great.

Was REALLY hesitant about buying something this expensive thru the mail however after reading the reviews I decided to take the chance.  We use this as our primary teleivsion and could not be happier.  The sound levels could be better but they are ok for our area/situation. We have a 32 inch version of the same television and it is significantly louder than this one, I am not sure why.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "55le5500 world's largest big screen radio  LG SUCKS!!!", "Author": "demanding consumer \"dj--lady-e\"", "ReviewID": "R2VBD9H5A97CI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV July 4, 2010 on a 24 month plan.  At the 22nd month, the tv screen went dark.  I called LG who told me,  they do not stand by their product, and since the warranty is only for one year, a television that is one year and 10 months old is not their problem and they will do nothing about it.  They also said products fail - sorry.  DO NOT BUY ANY LG PRODUCTS.  The company has matter-of-factly implied to me they do not care about the consumer and at every opportunity will hide behind legalities to avoid culpability for any problems or failures of their products.  Using a pair of binoculars to watch your neighbors tv will work better than an LG.  I give this product and this company ZERO STARS.  THEIR PRODUCTS ARE GARBAGE - BOYCOTT LG. That is the only way this company may begin to understand that it is absolutely unreasonable to make inferior products and charge superior prices.  I have two more payments to make on the world's largest flat screen radio.  I am freakin pissed.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "55 in.

One was delivered 4/22 and the other 4/28. Right center edge of the LED TV were damaged by the stand center post. Bezel at front was bowed out and rear plastic dented in. The padding for the stand was cut by the center post and the styrofoam is to loose around the stand. The outside box was in fine shape on both TV's. I am now out $5000 till the insurance claims clear.If you buy this and are able to pick it up in the warehouse, open it up and check it, remove the stand from the box before transporting.I called LGSERVICE and they confirmed that any external damage to the set will void the warranty.This is an edge lit display and the edge is delicate and very thin. There is no extra plastic to protect it from the rear and the metal front bezel is slightly thicker than a soda can and very flexible.This unit needs a larger box and some non eco friendly urethane foam or higher density styrofoam to protect it in transit.Update 5/22/2010 Full credit has been received.I have since found LG 55\" tv's on display at Best Buy with same problem but the panel not bowed noticeably.Also one Samsung 55B8000 with damage at the rear center of the display dented in!
