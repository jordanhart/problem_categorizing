{"Reviews": [{"Title": "ST vs GT for the undecided", "Author": "shopperX", "ReviewID": "R2CMPWMHNZWAXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are like me and are undecided on which series of Panasonic to get here is the skinny.1st. If you are swayed by THX certification don't be, THX certification costs money for Panasonic so they only got it for their top two series televisions, the VT and GT. The certification doesn't mean much anyways, only that THX took that specific preset and set the levels to their own specifications.  You can do the exact same with custom.  The ST has the exact same picture panel as the GT and using custom settings you can achieve 99% of the picture quality as the GT, the only difference is the gray scale level settings in the pro menu, 2 point vs 10 point I believe, which to the naked eye will be negligible to most viewers anyways, even to most videophile snobs despite what they say. I personally never used the THX settings anyways on my past Panasonics preferring to use my own settings with custom.2nd.  Truly, the only real difference between GT and ST is the design of the TV and the dual core processor for graphic speeds while using the browser on the GT, which I use a laptop for anyways but if you want to use this as your monitor, which I don't recommend using plasma screens for monitors, then perhaps the processor speed is better for you.  For aesthetics, it's clearly a personal preference but if you like the look of the GT over the ST and it's worth the money to you go for it but don't spend the extra cash thinking it's going towards better picture quality.3rd.  Buzzing.  Don't let another person's over sensitive ear turn you away from these sets. This also depends on the individual though so go to a store and turn the sound off a set and listen up close.  I can understand some people are plain sensitive to sounds, sights, smells and all other manners of disturbances but the buzzing on these tvs is way overhyped.  When people hear the word buzz they tend to think of a fly in their ear or metalic rattling or vibration sound but on the plasmas its more of a low humming.  I can really only hear it when I have the set muted during commercials.  ALL plasmas do this and if you never heard it and are nervous once you hear it you will no doubt be in disbelief what others are complaining about, it's nothing. I don't know if some sets are more \"buzzy\" than others but my two sets absolutely, positively can not be heard with even low volume on and even when muted and humming during muted white background scenes it's very hard to hear from in front of the set and it doesn't bother me in the slightest.  If it was more of a rattle, or vibrating metalic sound I think I would be annoyed but its just a low hum during screenshots with high white levels.4th. Image retention/Burn in. I have read that the ST's suffer from burn in more easily than past models and I think this is false based on most of the complaints seem to come from people who open up the box hook up their ps3 set the tv to vivid or game mode and start going to town only to turn off the console and switch it over to the game. That is a surefire way to have your health meter or the score of your favorite team permanently scorched into your set.  If this is your first foray into plasma and have been reading about burn ins and are nervous about it just follow the advice of every site that tells you to let your tv settle in for the first 100 hours or so.  Yeah that means for about a week after you got your living room Ferrari you can't really put it into full throttle yet but it's worth the wait.  I always turn all my settings way down below 50, especially brightness, for the first week or so and zoom in on any game or news channel with a ticker or bug(channel logo).  Image retention shouldn't frighten you, it's normal and goes away quickly if you have broken your tv in properly.  These sets get better over time. These newer model sets are head and shoulders more resistant to burn in then the first models of plasma anyways.  You almost have to try to burn in an image after the set is broken in but with that being said, 100 hours is the recommended time but really take it easy for a good month of regular viewing before you start gaming hardcore on it and even then it's best to use the whitewash scroll bar every hour or so while gaming.  Respect the tv and it will treat you well.  Don't fall asleep in front of the tv while watching netflix or blu rays, these sets have off timers and if you think you are going to crash then set the tv to turn off in 60 minutes to be safe because it's just best not to ever let a static menu or any image sit on any plasma for hours on end but even if you do it's still highly unlikely you'll get permanent burn in but the image retention will probably last awhile before it goes away, usually the amount of time it was static on screen is the amount of time it takes to disappear with regular viewing.  I generally let the scroll bar run every time for a cycle before I turn off the tv at night, it takes a minute and is like getting the oil changed in your car to keep it running efficiently.5th. Glare.  If you have it right in front of a window close the curtain.  If you have a lightbulb dangling in front of the screen turn it off.  It's a glass screen and there will be a little glare but unless you have a light source shining directly at the tv it will be fine.  Regular lighting won't bother this set at all, i.e. floor and end table lamps, most overhead indirect lights won't be picked up on screen.  If you have it underneath a chandelier I guess it might pick up some glare but otherwise don't worry about the glare this tv handles light like a champ and really this set will drop your jaw in low to dark light anyways but for those sunday football games don't worry you can watch the game without being worried about seeing the sad look on your face in the screen when your team fumbles it at the goal line. This set handles glare way better than what we're used to with plasmas. And in bright daytime light the screen is more than bright enough to not get washed out by indirect sunlight like some older models.Lastly, Calibration.  Right out of the box people that have never had an hdtv before will be impressed but others who have had hdtv's may not.  The preset settings, imho, have always been junk and even on tube tvs I always tinkered with the settings to my liking.  There are many sites that offer calibration settings and I recommend DNice's settings but don't be afraid to dive into the custom mode and set it up exactly the way it looks perfect to you.  Also, every room has different lighting so settings that may look good on one set may not exactly look the same on the exact same set in another room.  You won't ruin the tv tinkering around so make it perfect for you. Advanced videophiles accept under 3 color error calibration, basically tweaking the color settings to be as complimentary and natural as possible, is the acceptable picture quality setting and with this set you can get it calibrated to below 1 which is almost reference quality, meaning this would be the set experts would reference to compare all the other brand's sets picture quality too if it wasn't for the VT.  It's that impressive and you can't just do that with any brand set by adjusting the settings, not many tv's can get subtle shades and hues just right no matter how many hours you spend futzing with the settings but this set is as close as it gets.  Only the VT series can offer a better picture and it's because it offers many more settings to be controlled and adjusted and you will feel those extra contols in the wallet.Overall, the ST provides all kinds of bang for the buck. It is a vast improvement even over last years flagship model VT series. What made last year's VT so enticing was it's black levels which have been improved on with this years ST, GT and VT.  You are buying plasma for it's inky blacks and deep colors that pop on screen and the black widescreen bars practically disappears into the bezel and the colors are vibrant but natural and not over saturated like they were on my G25. It handles fast paced scenes really well but I turn off the motion smoother to get rid of the \"soap opera effect\" and action isn't stilted or juttered at all. The detail in darker scenes and the popping of the colors is what sets this tv apart from other brands. Watching nature documentaries in blu ray on this set is jaw dropping. Even Netflix HD looks killer on this. If what you are concerned about is picture quality and believe the extra money for the GT is going to give you a better picture then save your money and get the ST. Even cnet recommends the ST over the GT based solely on the price vs picture performance. If you are on a budget but want a top tier tv ST is it but if you truly have money to spare then skip both ST and GT and get the VT and have it professionally calibrated and you may end up with the best hdtv ever made yet just ask any Kuro owner who has seen this year's VT.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nearly Perfect TV", "Author": "A. Person", "ReviewID": "R3ARX6G9YIM49S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I use the term 'perfect' by most people's standards.  I'm sure professioanl calibrators and very picky videophiles can find numbers to show where there can be a lot of improvement, just as with all tvs,  However, I likely represent the majority in what constitutes being considered almost perfect for a tv.I certainly have not had the tv calibrated or even changed the settings much.  However, the picture is stunning as it is and calibration would only make it that much better, although possibly less stunning for those who want that more than realism.  :)  I would say the contrast is too high and for me personally there seems to be too much of a reddish skin tone, but all of that can be dealt with when I feel like changing settings.The bottom line is that the picture is great, to my eye the blacks seem very good, audio is the best of any tv I have tried, the price is amazing, the awesome uniformity and viewing angles of plasma, improved motion compared with last year (apparently), etc...I say the audio is awesome, but keep in mind I have only been using tv speakers for years and years, so I am not comparing with surround systems.  As horrible as most tv speakers sound, though, these sound better to me.  During normal tv shows, the news, etc... I was thinking it sounds too \"off in the distance\".  But when I watched Sucker Punch and had the volume a bit louder, I was amazed at the bass and just overall substance of audio.  Maybe I am mistaking bad audio for good audio just because it's different, but it sounds good to me personally and someone online ahd said Panasonic apparently did some change in speakers, which would explain the differences.The only negatives I can come up with, which are quite minor, are:1. Puts out a TON of heat.  Even for plasma, it seems much warmed to me than the st30 sets did.  Maybe I have it brighter than I did on those though.2. Only 3 hdmi inputs.3. Only one hybrid composite/coomponent input.  So you can only use ONE out of those two types combined.4. At first didn't ntoice you have to go to the input list and press an arrow button to set it to component or else if yuo use a component hookup it is treated as composite and the picture is only black and white.5. No audio/headphone jack.  I have tried many tvs from 2011 and a couple 2012 tvs and almost all of them had this, but the Panny does not.All minor things to deal with in exchange for great picture quality and sound quality.  The only way I will be returning it is if I can't get it to stop hurting my head.  I've had tons of both plasma and eld sets bothering my head or eyes.  This is not much different.  It feels like something tightened around my head when I watch it.  Maybe flicker, maybe reflections, maybe who knows what else.  I'm going to be depressed if I have to return such a great tv because I've tried most everything else and nothing with great picture quality is easy on my head and eyes for some reason.The GT50 sets come out this month and are likely to be technically better, but not worth the $700 or so extra in cost, I personally believe.  On paper, anyway.  The only real differences are THX certified mods (which still won't be accurate enough since everyone has different viewing environments), an extra hdmi port, and supposedly twice as many color gradations or w/e it's called.  So for $700 you're basically getting an extra port and barely noticable picture changes is my assumption.  COuld always be that it ends up better though.  :)Oh i forgot to add this still has the buzzing like the ST30 as far as my set goes.  About 5 feet away it was loud enough to hear while watching a movie.  I just think the picture is worth all of this.  I tried the Sony HX929 and even a second 929 set as well.  Both had very slight flashlighting, the blooming is absolutely horrible, as are the uniformity and viewing angles.  I think a lot of people who review that set just want to feel it's worth the money when theyr ate it so highly.  I do think it's MUCH better at getting rid of flashlighting and bleedthrough than edge lit sets, but it costs double their price as well.I did not test this tv in 3D yet.  I was going to get the 2012 blyetooth panasonic 3d glasses, but I dont want to have to pay to ship them back if I cant keep this tv due to my head issues.EDIT:  lol Just noticed someone on another site sayigng I'm a troll; for mentioning that this puts out a ton of heat.  Yes, they caught me.  Indeed someone rating this 5 stars is trolling by saying the truth that it puts out more heat than others.  i tried several ST30 sets and the Samsung PN51D7000 and never noticed as much heat as this one.  now the pastc ouple days I ahve not ntoiced it as MUCH, but it'ss till mroe than those other models.  To the point where I feel a layer of heat if I am standing a foot or two from the tv.  Definitely not only the back of it.  Also the buzzing is louder than I would like and as bad as the 2011 ST sets.Also I forgot to mention that the anti-reflective layer gets rid of nearly all reflections.  It still looks nothing like matte, but it's much better than most other glass screen tvs.EDIT 2:  For whatever reason, the tv seems to be putting out a lot less heat now.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe related to brightness levels I am using.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Picture I have ever seen", "Author": "Phillip", "ReviewID": "R1CKRPVWW745SG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned Panasonic Plasmas in the past and I have to say I have always loved them, but hands down this TV is in a whole new ball park. The picture is absolutely astounding. It simply blows any other TV I have ever seen away. I cant recommend this one enough. I have told everyone I know how good this thing is and the friends who have seen it in person are saying the same. I actually converted a few of my friends and convinced them not to buy one of the new LED TVs after seeing it.I do want to give a plug here to the AVSFORUM guys. I really appreciate the recommendation on this one and am glad I bought this one rather than last years model.BUY THIS TV!", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "An absolutely wondeful TV.", "Author": "The Lost Sailor", "ReviewID": "RREBWWZDDD2MY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a diehard videophile.  But I'm also not completely indifferent to how my television looks and performs.  I wanted a TV that looked sharp, performed well, and had a bright and smooth picture.  With the ST50, I found it.First, let me say this: I read quite a few reviews discussing \"buzzing\" sounds emitted by the ST50.  Quite honestly, it nearly kept me from buying this TV.  Truth is, it's simply not a problem.  I've come to the conclusion that the folks who wrote those reviews either have a defective unit or are unfamiliar with plasma televisions generally.  Based on how they work, it's entirely normal for plasmas to make a usually inaudible buzz.  On this television, I sit anywhere from 3 feet (when playing FIFA on the Xbox) to 12 feet (when watching movies) away.  Under any normal circumstances, I hear no buzz at all.  In order to pick up any hint of a buzz, I have to mute the television and either (1) place my head within one foot of the screen, or (2) stand behind the set.  Just about every plasma in the universe will do the same.  I've not had to \"tune anything out\" or \"learn to ignore\" any noise.  I just don't hear it (and my hearing is fine).Before buying the ST50, I decided to switch from my old plasma to a current LED-LCD set.  So I bought a Samsung ES6500.  At first, I appreciated how much brighter it was than my old TV, and it seemed to be very sleek and fit in well with my living room.  But when I actually started to watch TV, I was disappointed.  Fast motion (even with the image-enhancement software on) caused images to blur and become somewhat jaggy.  Football and soccer were tough to watch, and that's putting it generously.  Also, I noticed some light bleeding in from the edges (a little more research showed that this was due to the LED light location, and was to be expected).  I wasn't happy, and I returned it in favor of the ST50.I'm *really* glad I did.  The ST50 is fantastic.  On my prior plasma screen, I encountered what is called \"the screen door effect\" -- i.e., when you can see individual pixels and certain objects will look very slightly blocky.  On this one?  Nothing of the sort.  The picture is perfectly bright, totally smooth, and extremely crisp.  The sharp picture is only made better by the fact that the blacks on the screen are very, very deep and offset the colors perfectly (quite unlike the LED).  Sports look incredible, and movies and games look great, no matter what distance I'm sitting away from the screen.  I should also say that I've not even tweaked the calibration...the picture settings are one of the four default modes (not sure which one, but all four look great)Also, a big problem with some plasmas (including my last one) is an annoying glossiness that causes all kinds of reflections.  I've got no idea what Panasonic did here (they call it Louver technology, whatever that is), but it's awesome.  It's not the matte anti-reflective coating that blurs images, but it still does a great job of keeping reflections from showing up.  One of the best features of the TV, without a doubt.I've got 4 pairs of 3D glasses (sold separately, unfortunately), but I don't use the 3D function on the TV.  It's okay, but, honestly....it just doesn't appeal to me.  I think it's a fad, and I'm not qualified to review it, because I'll probably only use it when people want to see how 3DTV looks and won't accept my answer of: \"Like 2D, but it's dimmer, and it gives you a headache.\"The sound's okay.  It's what you'd expect from a flat-screen's internal speakers.  I use them on a daily basis, and I've got no complaints.  No real praises to sing...but no complaints, either.Do the research, read the reviews, and check out the expert recommendations.  The majority seem to agree on one thing: this TV is the best one in or near its price point, and maybe the best overall buy this year.  I'm inclined to agree.In short, if for no other reason, the picture on the TV makes it completely worth it.  Bright as an LED, smooth as a plasma, sharp as anything out there.  If you're in the market for a TV around the $1,000 - $1,500 price range...this is the one you want.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Except for the burn-in and Panasonic, pretty great", "Author": "Derek Zumsteg \"DMZ\"", "ReviewID": "R7XLJ8HM2JS9X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First, I know that not everyone's going to encounter this, and it's entirely possible I got a bum screen. But hear me out.I had this for 3 months without any major issues. I started to play co-op Borderlands 2 with friends a couple hours at a time, a couple nights a week and for a little longer on weekends. And when I wasn't playing, the TV had other exciting dynamic things to display.Now I have burn-in. On a white or light-colored background, you can see the ghost elements (and once you've noticed them, it's hard to not see).The quick-start guide in the manual says \"avoid displaying the same image for long periods of time\" and calls out some things like sports and video games that are problematic. But it never occurred to me it might be something like playing the same game for 10h over a week's time. And I know it was that light because my friends' schedules meant our window was ~9:30-12 or so on certain nights.If the manual had said anything like \"as a general rule, avoid anything that shows the same things for more than an hour without a break\" I'd have taken that seriously, and if I didn't, it'd be my own fault. But I had no idea, and there's no guidance.I talked to Panasonic customer support and said \"Hey, what's the scoop, this was pretty light usage, what do I do?\" Their response was \"Screen burn-in is not covered in your warranty.\"That's it. 3-month old thousand-plus-dollar TV having burn-in issues under what I felt was entirely reasonable usage, and that was their response.

I was doing the D-Nice 100 hour panel prep running in slideshow mode, when I realized there were four stuck/dead pixels towards the center of the screen. I figured I would continue the panel prep and see if they became un-stuck. After the prep and calibration, the stuck pixels were still evident, so I tried using pixel flipper on the Disney \"Wow\" calibration Blu-Ray with no luck. First I ran pixel flipper the recommended 1 hour, and then I ran it over night. I contacted Amazon and exchanged it for another set.The second set arrived by CEVA (white glove service), they plugged it in and powered it up and left. I did a firmware update via WIFI and began my slideshow when I noticed a solid white pixel burning bright every time the color blue passed over it. Also, about 15% of the right side of the screen had vertical pale lines (or shadows) running up-and-down the screen. I called Panasonic concierge service and they set up a case number and requested pics. I emailed them the pics and they said they would get back to me in 24 to 48 hours. That was six days ago! As a consumer, I do not like that I have to chase them down to resolve this issue, but my last call to them was still a \"we'll get back to you\" response. The set is going back!If I was rating this based on Amazon's response, I would give Amazon 5 stars - they have been amazing. Panasonic should be ashamed of them selves in the way they have handled this, maybe they need to go back and learn customer service again.Update 8-28-12. Amazon sent a replacement ST50 for the broken one. Now, CEVA keeps changing the delivery dates on me. Originally it was scheduled to be delivered on 8/24 so I took a half day off from work. Apparently it didn't arrive in Denver in time to be loaded on the truck so that was canceled. The dispatcher rescheduled it for Monday and my wife took the day off. The TV wasn't loaded on the delivery truck and a different dispatcher told her it would be rescheduled for Tuesday. I called and said I couldn't take anymore time off and could they deliver it early Tuesday A.M.? They gave me a 8:00am to 10:00am delivery time. They were a no show!!! Now it's rescheduled for Friday the 30th. Update:8-31-12 After three \"delays\" CEVA showed up 2 hours late after the re-re-scheduled delivery time. Very disappointing.  On a side note: I have to point out that the solo Ugandan delivery guy from CEVA was great, he was very upbeat and helped me set up the TV.  Kudos to him!Update: 9-11-12: Called Panasonic tech support regarding picture quality. The new set looks pale and too soft for HDTV. Basically, if the subject is bright, the TV looks pretty good, but medium to low light scenes looks pixelated and undefined, plus horrendous motion blur (using HD Dish and Blu-Ray). The ST50 went through the 100 hour panel prep and set to D-Nice settings with minor adjustments using the Disney WoW disc. The issues are the same no matter if I use Panasonic factory settings (albiet brighter) or the custom cali. settings (whether D-Nice, CNET or other). The first phone tech set up a case number and was helpful, he forwarded me to another, and that tech was rude and condescending. Not helpful at all, basically read from a sheet and barked orders at me. He had me set the TV to factory settings again (confirming it looks bad) and then suggested I return the set to Amazon. I requested Panasonic take responsibility for this and now I'm back to, \"someone will call me in 24 to 48 hours.\" Not a problem, but having someone talk to you like you had no business calling - is my biggest complaint right now. If I could give this a half star, I would.Update 9-14-12 No call back after 48 hours. I called Concierge once again and the tech was polite, but started at square one. I was a little surprised that the case# did not have much recorded info regarding the problems I have with this TV. So I started over again and the tech walked me through the now familiar settings in custom > pro and advanced settings. Same results. The call took longer than I anticipated, so I had to cut it short. I thanked him for his help, but I'll have to call back on the 15th. That little Concierge welcome sheet with the beautiful font is worthless.Update 9-27-12 Panasonic Concierge was a complete waste of time. Issues I'm having seem to be the same issues that a small percentage of new owners on AVSForums, Highdefjunkies are experiencing are falling on deaf ears. Those vertical shadows that I've ignored aren't going away as the screen ages. Focusing issues when the subject is farther away are still present. Mid to low light still lacks and ABL, ABL, ABL (yes, three times) is driving me bonkers. Why calibrate the friggin' TV if it's going to do it's own thing? Screw it! I'll entertain the kids using shadow puppets than deal with this crap anymore.Last update 10-05-12 Amazon set up a return through CEVA and a guy name Derek called. He was very helpful and had a contracted courier service come by and picked it up in the time frame that allowed me to take off from work. He (Derek) was very helpful and polite. Back to the ST50 - I miss the \"pros\" of the 50ST50 already, but the \"cons\" were annoying enough to send it back. Panasonic tech support was, and still is, useless.

The white glove service was several days faster than promised and they did a wonderful job. TV was quite good - but not as good as I expected (I already own a 2-yr old Panasonic Plasma that we love.) Did the basic cnet settings and ran the solid color slideshow over a couple of nights to help with the break-in period. On the third day I turned the set off for a couple of hours and when I turned it back on the set DIED. Just got 7 blinks of a red LED on the front bezel (internet research showed that the blink code meant that one of the major circuit boards was fried.) So I called Panasonic's touted \"Concierge Service\" that claimed they usually repaired sets within two days. Two days later (with no call-back from Panasonic) I called them again -- they said they couldn't find anyone (yet) to fix the set at my home in Iowa, but maybe in a few more days they might be able to locate someone! That wasn't what I was expecting for a brand new plasma TV.So I called Amazon customer service, and the rep immediately asked if I wanted a refund, a new TV or a different model or brand. I asked for a new TV, and he immediately placed the order.

My main goal was to get a TV without the horrible soap opera effect and oversaturated colors so many are now accepting as normal.  I don't want TV shows and movies to look like they were shot using a home video camera.  I don't want a TV to have to do tricks with motion control to hide the fact that it cannot display fast action scenes without tearing or ghosting.  I don't want to give up picture quality just to get a super flat TV with a thin bezel.  The ST50 was everything I was hopng forI have this wall mounted and it was very light and easy to maneuver.**NetworkWas able to connect to my wireless network without issue and perform a software update. I believe it was at 1.120 out of the box but the update took it to 1.140.  To update the firmware go to Menu > Network > Software Update.  I streamed several 720p and 1080p movies over the Wi-Fi from my Synology NAS via Seagate theater+ and it works surprisingly well.  If I didn't have such a strong Wi-Fi signal I'd attach it to the LAN using the Ethernet port.**PictureWow!  Everything I was hoping for.  There is nothing like dropping a big chunk of dough and then having that sick feeling that you bought the wrong thing.  I have no regrets with the ST50.  Natural color, stunning HD cable and blu-ray.  Fast motion is flawless and no soap opera effect.

There is no distracting reflections and the screen is not washed out.**SoundNow obviously the built in sound is not going to replace your external audio system but I have to say the sound is far better than I expected.

I couldn't have cared less if this TV had it or not but since it did I picked up a pair of 3D glasses and an IMAX 3D movie to check it out.

And I felt my investment was justified when I watched my first Blu-ray movie on the set and was bowled over! This was the honeymoon period...In addition to watching movies on the set, I hooked up the stereo to it so I could see info on the music that was playing. 4 months into my ownership, I realized that the persistent image of the stereo logo on the screen was not my imagination. With some research, I figured out this was either Image Retention or Burn-in. Now, I had always believed that this was something that occurred only in older plasmas and in TVs where the same image was kept on the TV for many many hours. How could this have happened to my TV when I had been using it for less than 4 months? More importantly, the burned-in image of the stereo logo was never visible for more than 15 seconds?Well, Panasonic's customer service made sure they lost a customer for life with their response: Not Our Problem. The fact that they give no prominent warning about Image Retention or Burn-In? Not Their Problem. The fact that they exclude that issue from their (Extremely) Limited Warranty? Not Their Problem. Check out various websites and you will see a long list of customers with problems after purchasing recent Panasonic Plasma TVs.A final word: Yes, the images can be beautiful. Yet, Panasonic's uncaring customer attitude in both not warning about the chances of IR/Burn-in and then completely abdicating responsibility for the resulting damage after limited use leaves a very bad taste in the mouth.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic ST-50 great picture but be warned ....", "Author": "Gary Kloner", "ReviewID": "R2TY4K9U1WUJGB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Panasonic VIERA TC-P50ST50 50-Inch 1080p 600Hz Full HD 3D Plasma TVI've had this set for about 3 weeks now. I've been very satisfied with the picture quality. Watching HD sources is a pleasure. I find myself watching things I ordinarily wouldn't watch just because of how gorgeous the picture is . The 50\" screen is not too big at all for me at about 90\"inches away. The controls are easy and intuitive to use The basic set up is easy. The set has beautiful aesthetics on par with Samsung or better and makes any room its in look better. The set does run much warmer than an LED in cinema mode but its not really a big deal.There is one big caveat. This Plasma is prone to burn in of images or as the manufacturer calls them \"image retention \" as stated in the owners manual. This can be caused by the same static image kept on the screen too long or as in my case not doing anything except watching a channel that happens to have a long white strip bar running across the top of the screen during MSNBC shows with its logo at the end.So, in my case, what happened after about three weeks, to my horror and disappointment, I noticed a ghost bar from MSNBC right at the top of the picture and in the corners while watching other channels. Let me emphasize its not very noticeable but once you first discover it, its there every time you look whenever the background is light. I just spent $1099 for a highly recommended HDTV plasma and I'm shocked and horrified. I now have a plasma panel that is permanently scarred in that upper part of the screen. I don't think I should have to live with this . So my only option is to return the set to Amazon, go through the hassle of ordering a brand new one and then use the zoom feature from now to prevent that strip bar and logos from ever appearing in my picture while watching channels like MSNBC.P.S.Amazon has agreed to exchange the set with a brand new one all in one visit. Thank you Amazon !Also I have since learned that the set has a \"anti image retention program \" which runs a vertical scroll bar across the screen that erases ghosts and images due to burn in.Amazon delivered a new ST-50 . Its been great no problems. The anti image retention functions works. Still a beautiful picture --among the best . I luv watching Blue-rays in cinema mode. I do of course manage how I watch certain channels like MSNBC by using the zoom . I also use the standard mode more often esp with talking head shows than cinema mode and with pixel orbiter enabled . I expect to do this at least for 3 or 4 months during breakin until the panel has aged.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "An Excellent TV for the Money", "Author": "Chill", "ReviewID": "R1RHWQHMFZ8YTU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you do not understand any of the jargon from my review, CNET have two articles explaining how to interpret calibration results.  I watched my TV for 100 hours before I calibrated it.  Before I calibrated my TV, the faces of the sport anchors on SportsCenter in the Cinema preset had a green tint (common problem with Panasonic plasma).  After I calibrated my TV, the picture quality is unbelievable.  I bought this TV due to recommendations from online reviews.  I was not disappointed.  The black level (0.012 cd/m2 all-black screen) is simply outstanding.  Contrast measured approximately 135 cd/m2.  Screen uniformity, motion, and the horizontal viewing angle are excellent.  Color accuracy is very good except for green (2.7 dE cie 94(100% saturation test pattern)).  The colors really popped due to the TV's deep black level.  The grayscale is reasonable (1.6 dE).  The grayscale from my post-calibration results showed a golden/orange tint from 20 IRE to 30 IRE; a red tint on 10 IRE, 80 IRE, and 100 IRE; and the correct gray from 40 IRE to 70 IRE and 90 IRE.  The average color temperature from 10 IRE - 100 IRE measured 6385K, and the average gamma measured 2.21.  The target gamma and color temperature for grayscale is 2.22 and 6,500K, respectively.  I noticed that the sport anchors on SportsCenter looked warmer than normal.  The color white on certain scenes looked a little red.  This information was confirmed from my calibration results on color temperature.  Chapter 3 of Battleship was very impressive when all of the soldiers were on the battleship.  I used this movie and ESPNEWS to judge color accuracy.  I really love Viera Cast's format and ease of use.  Despite its great picture quality and the user-friendly Viera Cast, this TV have a few minor issues. First, the TV makes a buzzing noise when the TV displays a bright scene.  Second, my 50\" ST50 has a swivel stand, but my 55\" ST50 does not.  Third, the speakers on this TV sound hollow at times.  Fourth, this TV does not handled light very well directly hitting the glass (common problem with plasma).  The windows in my living room are covered with curtains, and the light in my living room is controlled (dimmer) so these conditions allow me to have a plasma.  The light from my ceiling fan is not an issue.  Fifth, the vertical viewing angle will suffer due to the Infinite Black Pro Panel.  Go to panasonic.com to learn more about the Infinite Black Pro Panel.  Finally, I could not play some videos that I normally play on the YouTube app through the web browser.  Even with these minor issues, I still give this TV a 5-star rating.  Overall, I am very proud of owning this mid-tier Panasonic plasma!  I am not an expert when it comes to TV calibration, but some of the picture settings that I used from other websites did not work (on paper) for my TC-P50ST50.  Since I calibrate my own TVs, I will share my picture settings (dim-to-dark room) from my TC-P50ST50.  Note: These settings may not work with your TV due to unit-to-unit variation and room conditions.

I really LOVED my PN51D8000. It was awesome. I could never want another TV. Then my son threw a metal toy train at the screen. Gone.....Didn't want to spend $$$ with children and I really wanted a plasma again. So I researched. That led me to Panasonic. I'll be honest. I always thought Panasonic was one of those low-budget Dollar Store brands. I was wrong...I chose this TV over the GT and VT due to children possibly breaking a higher value ($$$) device. In addition I felt I could equal much of the GTs performance with a good calibration. (Although I suppose the cost of the calibration might equate to buying the GT). I also chose this TV based on research and customer reviews on various websites.While I think the Samsung I owned was overall more beautiful in design, this TV has a MUCH better picture. I was surprised. When it came to watching movies, I was even more impressed. Perhaps I didn't set my old Samsung up correctly, I don't know. I could really tell the colors were more vivid and the black detail was extreme (in awesomeness).I am very satisfied with this TV. At times I wish I could have got the VT for 96Hz movies, but then I think about the $$ and children throwing toys at it and will just wait patiently. However, I do think this TV is great regardless. I have an extreme eye for quality, very picky in fact; this device is a good deal.The TV dropped $150 a few days after I got it and Amazon credited my account. Sweet.I have no complaints. The buzz is just as minor as it was on my Samsung. I liked the Samsung menu(s) more. Panasonics is a bit lame, but it does its job. The Samsung had a few more settings for audio and burn in, but it was a higher model I suppose. My only issue is with the type of 3D signal it sends out. I'm not a fan of RF and even though all the mainstream research says Bluetooth isn't harmful, I just have a few issues wearing RF devices on my head for a few hours to watch a movie. But... I rarely watch 3D as it is and this TV was a great value so I suppose I can watch 3D in the future with a non-RF TV replacement.So there you go. A no frills review from a no frills guy. It's just sweet to think that if my son breaks this one, the heartache won't be the $$ it cost, but the picture quality it had.

Although the images produced were fantastic, it seemed the quality only stood against slower pictures, i.e. soap operas, talk shows, news broadcasts. While watching any faster moving image there was an incredible amount of motion blur, and screen flicker. The first flat screen I owned was a 42\" Vizio Plasma screen. It lasted 5 years after continual brutal use. Gaming upwards of 10-15 hours a day 3-5 days a week. I decided to look back into plasmas.

I wanted something that would have good picture quality above all, and would look nice in the room as well.  I don't like to sacrifice quality just to save money on an item I plan to live with for several years, but I also didn't see the point in buying the absolute best tv when this one is pretty darn close (and for a lot less money).I first considered the plasma vs. LED/LCD decision.  I had always heard things about LED like it is thinner, lighter, uses less electricity, and has a brighter picture.  My research and personal experience with both types of tv's confirmed that these differences are true, but much less so than in older models of plasma tv's.  For example, this 50\" Panasonic TC-P50ST50 weighs 48 lbs.  I bought a 42\" Panasonic plasma 3 years ago that weighs 72 lbs.  So the larger, more modern tv has a bigger screen and weighs about 1/3 less.  It is also much thinner (front to back) than my older 42\" Panasonic plasma, probably about half as thick.  So while these still weigh more and are thicker than a comparable sized LED tv, they really aren't that much thicker or heavier these days.  As for energy consumption, it looks like a few dollars per month more on your electric bill to have a plasma tv.  Probably $3 or so a month difference.  Plasmas are generally less expensive for similar quality and size than LED, so what little you lose on electricity charges with plasma you'll save upfront on the purchase price and then some.  Finally, yes LED's do have a brighter picture but that's not necessarily a good thing.  While it might stand out and catch your eye in a store, watching it for an extended time at home can cause that bright white to become a searing white and cause eye strain and fatigue.  This new plasma has much brighter, cleaner whites than my old plasma and to me just looks much more lifelike and real than the extremely bright whites of an LED.Motion - I like to watch sports, and the 600Hz refresh rate of plasmas makes a significant difference in fast moving objects onscreen.  Even with the interpolated 120Hz or 240Hz motion in LED/LCD's, it's not nearly as life-like and smooth.  Definite win for plasmas in this category.Blacker blacks - LED/LCD's have a backlight behind the pixels to illuminate the screen.  This is fine, but the backlight tends to bleed-thru black pixels to produce more of a dark gray than black.  Again, plasma wins (especially this plasma).Electric usage - Advantage LED/LCD here, but not significantly so.Image retention - Plasmas are known for a tendency to get image retention or burn-in if a static image is left on the screen for several hours.  This problem is much less of a concern in modern plasmas, and while there have been some reports of IR in extreme cases of these new models I have had no trouble with mine.  In fact, from my research it seems like even those who have suffered some moderate image retention usually have it go away after the set is broken in for a few hundred hours.Bezel - Clear plastic bezel makes this tv blend into the room, with a very thin black plastic border around the edge of the screen.  It really looks nice in my living room.Anti-reflective screen - The ST, GT, and VT series of Panasonic Plasma have an anti-reflection filter in the screens which reduces glare and makes these tv's more usable in brightly lit rooms.  LED/LCD's tv's with their overly bright pictures may still be a better choice for a room with lots of windows if you watch a lot of tv during the day, but this is filter makes this plasma watchable in somewhat well-lit rooms.Amazon TV buying - Scheduled delivery arrived within the 2 hour window I arranged when ordering.  I received 2% Amazon rewards in the form of a gift card for ordering from Amazon.  I knew Amazon would allow a no-questions-asked return in the event of any problem.  I found a lower price on this tv at one of Amazon's online competitors and received a price match with no hassle.  All in all, I am very pleased with the television and Amazon's service (as usual).Other thoughts - The swivel stand is quite nice.  This tv has excellent picture quality, good features, nice aesthetics in my room.  I'm enjoying it as much as I had hoped I would, and am happy to say all of my research paid off with me being very satisfied with a great price on a great tv.  My biggest regret would be choosing the 50\" instead of a larger screen, but that's my fault not the tv's!EDIT:  I have noticed some buzzing from the tv on bright scenes with low or no audio playing.  It's not terribly loud, but it is noticeable.  Doesn't bother me a lot, but it is the one negative thing I've noticed with this television I thought worth mentioning.

It's plasma, it's Smart and it shows 3D.  In fact it's even able to convert 2D media to 3D (with the push of a button on the remote).  I tried this feature on a HD movie I had recorded on my DVR, using my new Samsung 3D glasses (they work fine with the Panasonic and are less than 1/2 the price of the Panasonic glasses and are available on Amazon) and the 3D picture was really good even though the movie I watched was not made for 3D.The 2D/HD picture quality is akin to a HD movie theatre quality.  With the deep blacks and rich colors, you don't get the crispness of a LED/LCD, but what you DO get is a picture that, in HD, has the depth and quality as close to being 3D as it can be w/o actually being 3D.  In other words, it feels like you're actually in the scene rather than just viewing it on the screen.Some people in other revues have expressed concern about BURN-IN, i.e., the retention of a permanent ghost image on the screen when a logo, picture bars or some other image appears on the screen for an extended period of time.  This Panasonic (and I assume all new Panasonic Plasma TVs) has programming to prevent this.  To check to be sure it's turned on, go to the Menu and select \"Settings\" (bottom left).  To the right, in the drop down menu you will see \"Anti image retention\".  Select this and then select the \"Pixel orbitor\".  Be sure that it is enabled.  If you do this, the scary \"Burn-in\" should not be an issue.  However, in the event that an image does burn in, the third choice in the anti image retention menu is \"Scrolling bar\".  If you select this, the software will scroll the screen for 15 minutes to remove any ghost images that may have burned in.  You can stop this process at any time by hitting any key on the remote.  I hope you feel better now....I know I feel better knowing about these anti-burn-in features.Now from burn-in to the remote.  The remote is ergonomic and intuitive with buttons provided for all of the major functions.My 50\" came with a swivel stand, though the write-ups indicate it's supposed to be stationary.  But, it doesn't really matter because the viewing angle on this plasma is extremely wide.  Another advantage over the LED/LCD TV.I can't really rate the sound because it's plugged into my surround sound system via the optical output on the back of the set.  It also has 3 HDMI inputs and though an additional one would have been nice, this is, after, the mid-level Panasonic Viera.  There are USB and other inputs on the right side of the set.  And that's another advantage.  The inputs are arranged on the right side of the back of the set (easily accessible from the side) to facilitate mounting the TV on the wall if you're so inclined.Though 3D glasses are not included, you need not buy the $50+ Panasonic glasses.  The cheaper Samsung 3D glasses (about $20) available on Amazon work just fine.Lastly, the price I got from Amazon was about 2/3 retail and included free white glove shipping, i.e., delivered into my home, unboxed, set up and shown to be in good working order...all by the delivery service.

There are lots of other reviews on picture and sound, but here are a few comments on topics I haven't seen covered in other reviews (posted here in no particular order):1) Software updates may be a little slow:  A software update was necessary to access the web features of the TV, including Netflix and Amazon streaming video.  Expect to be prompted to update the software when you first set up this TV.  Be patient - I got a \"Couldn't connect to server\" error on the first several attempts, but the next day, everything worked fine.  Initially, I thought the problem may have been due to my home network firewall settings, but that turned out not to be the case.  If you get the \"Couldn't connect\" error, save yourself some trouble and just try again tomorrow.2) Tech support is great:  I called the provided tech support number when my TV couldn't update via the web connection, and they handled the situation politely and professionally.  In the case of a software update failure, Panasonic's tech support solution is to mail you an SD card with the software on it.  I received (and returned) the SD card according to their instructions, but I had corrected the issue myself (see point 1 above) before the SD card arrived in the mail.3) iPad app is okay:  The remote app for the iPad seems like a good idea, but falls a little short in real-world use.  Basic TV functions work quite well.  However, using the iPad app for web browsing is not intuitive, particularly in entering URL text and navigating webpages.  Also, I can't find an OFF control in the iPad app to turn off the TV.  This app is a great SUPPLEMENT to the provided remote control, but it is no SUBSTITUTE, so don't lose the remote!4) Banner ads are annoying (Don't get me started!), but they can be turned off:  As shipped, this TV displays ultra-annoying banner ads at the bottom of the screen when you turn first turn it on.  You can (and will) turn this off by finding the \"Viera Connect Banner\" setting in the setup menus and turning it off.5)  This TV ships via truck freight from Amazon:  As an Amazon Prime member, I've become spoiled by fast shipping and regular, accurate updates on delivery status via the regular shippers.  However, the truck freight companies don't communicate as well as UPS/Fedex, and their delivery date estimates are less accurate.  My TV delivery ended up being scheduled for a week later than Amazon's estimated delivery date because of holidays and the shipper's office hours.  I shaved three days off of the delivery time by picking up the TV myself at a local freight hub.  The TV is well packaged in a durable cardboard box, so you can transport it easily in a small pickup or SUV.6)  Audio output is limited:  This TV has lots of audio/video inputs, but the only audio OUTPUT is an optical (Toslink) output, so if you wish to A) use this TV's cable channel tuner and/or web content (Netflix, Amazon, etc.) and B) connect the TV to a home theater system, make sure your home theater receiver has an optical input.  You can buy cheap optical-to-RCA audio converters, but these generally only work for 2-channel audio.  This is fine for watching non-HD TV or older movies on Netflix/Amazon, but the newer content with HD or Dolby 5.1 or better won't play audio through the cheap adapters.  For watching the newer HD content through this TV, your home theater receiver must have an optical audio connection.  I believe the higher-end Panasonic TVs offer additional audio output options, so if you have an older home theater receiver, you should consider the economics of upgrading the TV vs. upgrading your receiver.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow (updated 4/12/2013)", "Author": "W.

I find myself sometimes marveling at the picture.Original review:I unfortunately seldom remember or take the time to post reviews, but in this case, I had to.  Let me start by saying I did a TON of research on this.  At first I thought I wanted an LED, because they were new and cool and must have the best picture, right?  But then I discovered that LED is simply another type of LCD screen, with all of the pro's and con's, and did NOT mean it had a better picture necessarily.  And I also was misled by the Plasma burn-in/image retention \"myth\".  Yes, it is possible, but you would almost have to set out to do that, that it really should never happen with \"normal\" TV watching.So, I opened my eyes up to the possibility of a Plasma.  Used Cnet, pcmag, and dozens of other sites to read reviews, but more importantly, actual user feedback.  I looked at LED Sharp, Sony and Samsung TV's, as well as Samsung and Vizio and Panasonic Plasma TV's.  After going back and forth and every day telling my wife, \"this is it, I found it\", only to change my mind again, I decided to step back and re-evaluate.  What did I want?  The best picture at any affordable price.  What did I not want/need?  Bells and whistles, like the best 3D and online content, the \"smart\" stuff.So I found this Panasonic VIERA TC-P50ST50 at another site.  Yes, it had the \"smart-stuff\" and 3D, but the price point did not seem to be inflated because of it.  Price was ok, but I thought I could do better.  None of the search engines showed Amazon as a seller of this TV, but I came over and searched for it, and lo and behold, the reviews were AWESOME.  And the price was easily the best, by anywhere from $100 to $400 dollars over others.  Throw in FREE shipping, and I was sold.  Great shipping experience, delivery experience, etc.You will see mention of some guy named D-Nice in the reviews.  Do yourself a favor, if you get this TV, search his info out, and follow it exactly.  What you are left with is a jaw-dropping picture!PROS:um, the picture!easy setup/tune/tweakThe remote (I like it, big backlit buttons.  Some will say it looks like a geriatric remote, nonsense)um, the picture ;-)CONS:Honestly, have not found much to complain about.  I guess the letter input via the remote in the \"apps\" section made me feel like I was texting on a flip phone again.  The sound is not great, but anyone who gets this TV most likely has a good home theater setup already.  Some have mentioned the lack of HDMI inputs.  I use my home theater pass-through, so this is not an issue for me at all.3D:Have not used it yet, that was a bell and whistle I did not need but it came with the set whether I wanted it or not ;-)SMART-TV:Built-in apps look cool, have not really used them much as I have a PS3, and that is Smart enough for meI would recommend this TV in a heartbeat.

Panasonic not so much.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Owen C Jones\"", "ReviewID": "R2FQ3U5J21W7AI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(Updated 2/26/2013) I purchased this TV to replace the Samsung UN40ES6100 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz Slim LED HDTV that I purchased from Best Buy and on which I have given an Amazon review dated November 27. This Panasonic TV is sweet to Samsung's sour. The picture is terrific with deep blacks, white whites and flawless color control. I quickly set this up to work with my Sony Blue ray DVD player and my Roku using HDMI 1-3 as inputs, and to control everything from my Logitech Harmony 510 programmable remote.I'll give some details about my experience with this TV but first, some information up front that will help you greatly get a great picture with this unit. It appears that all (plasma?) flat screen TVs need to be calibrated to get their best performance.I have now used the TV for the better part of two months. The unit is set up in our small living room right next to a triple window with blinds. None of the in-the-box picture settings were really useful so I went online and found a couple of reviews that gave custom settings they had used successfully. Both were quite similar and I only had to play around ever so slightly to get great results for my situation. Here is the result, courtesy of \"Gregorian\" from June 29, 2012, entitled \"A Unique Perspective.\" He says, and I quote,\"You really need to adjust the picture settings on this TV (duh). Doing so will result in exquisite picture quality. I had heard that this TV gives `flagship quality at a mid-range price' and I am here to confirm that.\"I echo this sentiment exactly. The resultant picture quality both day and night is superb. So, if you read no more of this review, at least this should help you get set up for fantastic viewing. Here are the settings \"Gregorian\" recommends with my notes where I fiddled ever-so-slightly:-PICTURE:  Picture Mode: Custom  Contrast: 80  Brightness: 58  Color: 46  Tint: 0  Sharpness: 0 (yes, turn this all the way down from 50)  [I set mine at 60 according to Claudia G.

Black level: Light  3:2 pulldown: On  (Off) Greyed Out on my unit  24p Direct in: 60Hz  Greyed Out on my unitSo, you may find these settings need to be tweaked for your particular setup/location but they produce a gorgeous picture for me.On other items:- No sign of image retention for me, even with things like the Fox News Bottom Banner and Logos. But, having seen the concerns expressed by others,  I have started turning the TV off when I am out of the room.- No plasma buzzing noticed.Now, on to some detailed comments on my experience with Amazon, Pilot, CEVA and the TV in general.  On balance, I love this unit that gives supurb quality at a reasonable price. Note, however that it has terrible internet functions [use a computer]. This disappointment kept the unit from getting my 5-star rating. After all, I am buying a TV for entertainment, not for use as an internet terminal.Amazon delivery was scheduled for 12/7 at the time the order was placed at the end of November (2012) and the trucking/delivery company did not disappoint. They called on the November 28th to confirm the delivery and, since the unit was early to them, we moved up the delivery a week to receive it on the 30th before we went off to Galveston for a few days.Pilot Trucking delivered, unpacked, set up and checked operation of the unit...true \"White Glove\" service. Perfect! Connection of all units was a breeze, simply connecting power to each external unit and connecting them to the TV with a single HDMI cord. I was strummin' along in banjo-land just soaking up the clarity, color and overall enjoyment of our new unit. However...A few days after delivery, after having played with the picture formatting, I noticed that the left-right black banding was uneven. I called Panasonic a couple of times to try to get their help in correcting this unevenness. In fact, I finally figured out that the right eight cm (a little over three inches) of the screen (out of a total of 112-cm [44 inches] width) appeared to be nonfunctional, cutting off the right side of the picture. Again I called Panasonic technical support and after several tries they could not help and escalated the issue to their senior support engineers. This was on a Thursday or Friday the 6th or 7th of December. Panasonic was quick on their return, getting back to me on Saturday PM on the 8th. After discussion their engineer said that the control board inside the TV needed to be replaced and they would contact a repair shop local to me and get back in touch. Now mind you I still have not contacted Amazon, thinking, I guess, that Panasonic warrantee repair would be best rather than using Amazon's excellent replacement services.On Monday the 10th, Panasonic did call back with the name and number of the local shop and the name of the person to contact. I called him (the shop manager) only to be passed off to his assistant who was out of the shop and was told he would call me back which he did the next day. That person thought the problem was the screen not the control panel and that they would have to order and then come out to repair. To make a long story just a little longer, that was the 11th and on the 17th still no repair. The shop said that while he did have the control unit in stock, the replacement unit was still not in house (shipped by truck on the 12th from WA to his place near my home in TX.) He then said he would have to take the TV to his shop for replacement of either. By this time, I am really getting a bad feeling about the whole affair. It's now more than two weeks since the unit was delivered and I still seem no nearer to resolution of this issue after dealing with Panasonic and their minions. So...I decided to finally contact Amazon to see what could be done.Results were swift after this...typical of Amazon Prime. Customer service in Lexington was quick in deciding the unit should indeed be replaced and in contacting their large items support people in Grand Forks, ND. Within 10 minutes, a new order was placed and the process started anew. Delivery was scheduled for after we returned from our New York visit to family. On Monday, January 7th, as scheduled, CEVA did deliver between noon and 3:00 PM. They arrived with three men and a truck, unpacked and set up the new unit. They had no booties so as a result left black boot marks on the floor. Also, they did not know that they had to pack up the old unit for return to Amazon but on reminder, searched and found the ship-back order in the cab. Aside from that, the delivery was quite professional.So for this overall experience I give 10-stars for Amazon's handling of the situation, 4-stars for the overall quality of the TV (deducting one star for the operational issue described above) but 1-star for Panasonic Technical Support. In future I will never attempt to use a company's technical support any time within the return period to Amazon. It's just not worth it.Regarding the TV itself, the picture is really pretty good out of the box, the sound mens-a-mens and the navigation straightforward. I have already written how I followed the advice of other reviewers regarding the settings as I am not much for detail in things such as this. However, regarding the internet options I have the following comments. Netflix: nowhere near as easy to use as on a computer or on my Roku (which is plugged into HDMI-3). Also the internet web browser a joke. First there apparently is no internal memory so cookies are not stored and thus usernames and passwords are not stored either. Also, moving the cursor with the remote is clumsy at best. I did get a wireless keyboard (small Microsoft unit) that has a joypad built in but still movement is slow and clunky, and very imprecise. Because of this, I sometimes find screen scrolling to be far behind my clicks and overshoot as a result. Going back up the screen is just as painful.Activity in the browser is also painfully slow for someone used to fast interaction on a computer with a 15 MB/sec cable connection...more like old times with a 2400 BAUD telephone hook-up.  This slowness has to be the TV itself since my total interconnection between the unit and my service is wireless to my router which is wired to the cable company's modem. I do not even use the internet capability for simple Netflix queue manipulations, Rather I use one of my small laptops (MacBook Pro 13) that I now keep right on the TV stand. I will continue to use my Roku for most of the Internet activities such as Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Fox News, etc., as it is much faster and easier to use than the TV.The eManual on the TV is also clunky...better to download the user's manual from the internet but that, too, is lacking in detail. What else? Oh yes, Amazon behaves quite similarly to Netflix on the TV internet setting, slow but usable. I would say if you want to use the screen for computer-like activities, get a computer and connect with HDMI.Note, too, that Panasonic in their infinite wisdom has done away with all RCA, Coax or other output connection capability and has only the optical \"Toslink\" audio. So, to use any of your existing audio gear that has any hair on them, you will need a DAC box with RCA jacks for output in which case you lose 5.1, I believe. This works fine for me for my headset that I use so as not to disturb Mary at night while I am watching. If you really want fine external sound I suggest that you get one of the newer boxes with the Toslink optical input connection. I think I will look for a system where I can plug in my optical cable and connect wirelessly with all five or six speakers.

I was looking for few things: Picture Quality, Capabilities, Price and Overall Design.Picture Quality: The PQ is amazing on these TV. It has great blacks and excellent bright room PQ. I live in on the top floor with the living room facing west so I get a lot of sunlight, thankfully PQ is still great, but much better in a dark room. HD movies are so realistic looking too. 3D is kinda wack though. I didn't really care about 3D and I don't think other models are any better than this model. I think we still have to wait a few years before 3D is really good on TVs also I don't have enough room in my living room to put the TV far enough for the 3D to be effective. Also TV does not come with glasses you have to buy them on their own for like 80 bucks. Overall PQ is Awesome.Capabilities: A lot of apps including netflix (which sucks), huluplus (haven't tried), youtube, amazon movies etc. Using the remote to type is annoying but if you get the keyboard its not annoying. If you have fast interent its even better. Its WIFI to which is cool. The interface is super simple which I like, my Dad who just learned how to use youtube can navigate through the apps with complete ease.Overall Design: It has 3 HDMI ports, and other ports, it swivels and has a cool looking stand, the remote is easy to use and has big buttons which is nice, the TV looks slick but their are much nicer looking.Price: Can't beat this price. the other TVs dont have the PQ like this one. They may have cooler capabilities but not by much and not worth the price. If you need more than 3 HDMI ports I guess that could be a reason not to get this tv. Also if 3D is super important maybe the more expensive TVs are better.

Fast and convenient delivery!For the first 100 hrs avoided playing 4:3 contents mostly and ran almost 60+ hours of slide-show as suggested by D-nice from HDJ (HighDefJunkies). Then switched to custom setting as suggested by him. Highly recommended settings. I typically do calibration myself based on calibration blu-ray that came with my Oppo player and these settings closely match with mine. Black levels are amazing and bezel and blacks merge so well that bezel disappears. I have not done extensive 3D image quality analysis as yet. First impressions and comparison to sharp 70in LED, this one looks better. Reg the hockey and other game issues that people reported, moving to custom settings and defeating few gizmos in advance settings eliminates that modulating brightness. (There seems to be an issue with image processing algorithm that works on average luminance wrt some threshold. It seems to get thrown off with camera flashes in indoor games.)Regarding the previous comment of viera remote app not working with ST50 - it is baseless. I have tried this app and works flawlessly. I have played back videos from my android phone to the TV by simply swiping! I believe the only feature that may not work with T50 is playing back a content from TV to the smartphone - I have not tried.For the money at this specific time, this is the best value.

Aside from some weird issues with scheduling the delivery, eventually everything worked out and the TV arrived in perfect condition.I did a ton of research on TVs (we had been in the market for one for months and months), and I also did a ton of research in these reviews, checking out the best settings, the most common issues, etc. I'm happy to report all the good things are true, and so far none of the bad.Reflection: Just a total non-issue. This was the one reason I didn't want a plasma. But this TV has a very good filter that really really dims the reflection, and all you have to do is close the curtains and it is gone. Also the picture is so distractingly beautiful that you won't be noticing any reflection. Once the sun goes down this is even more of a non-issue.Picture: Just...amazing. Right out of the box too, though the settings helped. I can see why some people may consider plasma to be a bit \"dull\" compared to an LED, but to me it just looks so lifelike and subtle. Especially blu-rays. It looks like you are looking through a window.Softness: Plasma picture does have a subtle softness to it, but it's good. It's not too sharp and high contrasty, it's just more like real life. At the same time, fine details look perfect. We have been watching the Fringe blurays and you could see every freckle on Agent Dunham's face!Motion Smoothing: TURN THIS OFF TURN THIS OFF TURN THIS OFF TURN THIS OFF. First thing you must do is go in the menu and set this to \"OFF\" (not \"weak\"), or else you just bought a $1000 terrible picture. Turn this off. There is no debate. This makes everything look like a behind the scenes featurette from a DVD.Motion after turning this off looks flawless. Very natural, everything moves like it should. This was a big concern for me before buying and it is why I returned a giant VIZIO TV a few months ago.Videogames: Look fantastic.Sound: We use a Yamaha surround sound system and I highly recommend it. That being said, at one point I heard the normal sound from the TV, and it was passable.Settings: I printed out 5 different settings from customer reviews from the other fine people here. I recommend them. I made some small adjustments. One big change though, is everyone seemed to prefer \"Color Temperature: Warm1\" or \"Warm2.\" In my opinion this gave everything a sickly yellowish tint. It made white snow look like pee snow, and it made pale people look healthy, which you don't want when you're using The Penguin from Batman Returns as a test. I can see the appeal of \"Warm\" but in my opinion, it's forcing the picture to look like something it isn't. All sunny and orange and yellow. Not everything should be that. Just set this to \"Normal\" and let the actual context determine what the colors look like.Image retention: Not one issue so far, and this is after leaving some things on pause for too long by accident. **SEE UPDATE*****Breaking in: I ran slides from a USB drive for a week. Not sure if it did anything, personally I don't see a difference in the picture quality, but it was recommended so I did it. Very easy to pop in the USB drive and run a slideshow.Angle: Indeed, looks fantastic from any angle.Well I think that's it! Barring any random problems, I think we will be happy with this TV for many many years. I look forward to coming home from work just to watch things on it, and it makes movie watching feel like an event. Love this TV.***UPDATE: Hi there. It has been about 2 months with this TV, and unfortunately now I am having huge problems with image retention. I don't play videogames for too long but images from them are now on the screen, and has remained for a few days now. Even images that are only on the tv for very brief moments are staying on the screen. I am starting to freak out that it's permanent, and I'm not sure what to do. I've ran the image retention wipe thing like 100 times, nothing seems to work. I still love the picture on this TV, but this has me very concerned. It has been days now and the image retention is not going away. I am considering returning this television but I am not sure I can.I have lowered my grade to 3 stars instead of 5, this issue has caused me nothing but stress all week.***UPDATE 2: So I thought I should be fair and update this review again. The image retention issue has really improved. It's basically not been a problem the past month. Maybe it had an awkward puberty or something? Basically I have still played video games, and been very careful about image retention, and it's been fine. I would actually recommend this TV because I am very happy with it, aside from that bad week where I updated this previously. Things have improved.

The image is amazing, blacks are very deep and viewing angles very wide (especially compared to LED TVs).The main differences with the top-of-the-line VT series (sold at basically twice the price) reside in technicalities that the average user will have a very hard time to notice.The ST doesn't come with a pair of 3D glasses, but I personally find the 3D features very overrated and nearly useless.The smartTV software is simple, but works more than fine. I mainly use Amazon Instant Video, and the setup was easy and intuitive. Slightly unrelated: the HD quality of the Streaming is very good (DVD-quality), provided you have sufficient bandwidth.Settings: I used D-Nice settings (found on hidefjunkies forum) as a starting point, then I very slightly tweaked them to my liking. At first the image will seem a little too dark and too \"warm\", but that's because standard settings on most TVs are too bright and too \"cold\", once you get used to the \"right\" settings it's very tough to go back.Image retention: I did not run the \"aging\" slides because I previously had a small 24 inch TV and just couldn't wait to use this one, but IR has been nonexistent so far. Even after watching a 3hrs NBA game on NBA TV, the logo on the lower right corner did not get stuck on the screen.I do not do gaming though, and my average time spent per day with the TV on is around 2-3hrs max, so keep this in mind when you ponder my opinion.Other reviewers have noticed this TV making a buzzing noise, I did not at all, and I'm using the TV speakers, so sound is rarely \"loud\".Another noticed issue was with hockey, you can just resolve that by disabling all of the fancy and useless features like the putrid Motion Interpolation and the likes.

Just great. In fact, if you find the right HD movie you can see what the reviewers over on CNET, or other similar sites, call \"inky blacks.\" It's just ridiculous. I have tons of fun with it playing my XBOX.Took my time buying the 'right' hdtv. Glad I bought this. The picture quality easily demands more than the asking price.Used Samsung SSG-4100GB 3D glasses with this. 3D looks really good. Although I've only used one title.Highly recommend this tv. Can't say enough.Things I like:-From what I understand the 50\" is the only one that comes with the base being able to swivel or turn. So, when I'm in the kitchen I can turn the tv to face me when I cook.-Slim profile, very thin and the bezel is narrow.-Amazing Picture! Great viewing angle ( didn't really get this and appreciate this till I got this ST50 and viewed friend's tv)Things I don't like:-The UK models allow you to USB connect an external hard drive to record tv. The US model doesn't. Lame.-When the screen is white at times a noticeable humming noise happens. I rarely notice it. Rarely. It's either b/c it doesn't happen all the time or it's so low I can not notice it.

Went with CNET on this one, and so far I agree that this TV has some of the best image quality I have ever seen in this price range.  We are constantly blown away by how good the TV looks.The only negative note I wanted to share:Image retention/burn-inLet me start by saying that I did NOT do the 90-200 hour color slide burn in that some people suggest.  I didn't like the idea of leaving an unattended plasma running that long.  I'm also a gamer. (see where this is going?)  I was very careful in the first month or two with the TV, hyper-sensitive to onscreen HUDs and other static images that could lead to burn in/IR.  I was constantly running that scrolling bar feature (really wish there was a shortcut to this), and I would frequently check to make sure I wasn't getting any burn in/IR.  I guess I got too comfortable thinking the TV wasn't as sensitive as I was treating it.  Sure enough, after a couple chance evenings of extended play sessions ( say 3-5 hours, 2-3 nights in a row), I started to notice 3 blurred lines that just happened to line up with the Borderlands 2 HUD - specifically, the text that lists objectives in the upper right corner.  The text changes, so I thought I would be fine, but I guess the white text with black outline was enough to cause a general blurred look in that area.  I was horrified as soon as I noticed it, thinking I had just trashed a $1k tv.  During the scrolling black and white bars, I could just barely see the three small blurred lines.  I was uber bummed until I realized that these marks were VERY hard to see while watching any other content.  I only notice it once and a while when I am really looking right for it.  I can't see it while watching ANY content - it only shows up on stark white scenes, and even then it is just BARELY visible. So I just went about tv watching/gaming as usual, though just a bit more careful about my viewing habits.  I think the lines have since faded (after maybe 1 month of regular viewing?), but I could just be crazy after staring at those marks for so long.  Again, it is barely noticeable - I point it out to my friends and fiance, and they swear they can't see it, or perhaps just barely once I have pointed it out.Lesson learned: I still LOVE this TV.  Just be careful with it. You don't need to baby it, but just be careful and run the scrolling bars as often as you can.  I still plays lots of games (though I haven't turned on Borderlands 2 since), but I do check very often to make sure nothing is burning in.  Just be aware of onscreen HUDs - some games will let you turn them off.  I've been playing Black Ops 2 for some time now, and I haven't noticed any issues.  Just pause every once and a while and hit those scrolling bars for a couple min.  It sounds like a pain, but honestly, it is totally worth it for the image quality.  I hate the way most LCD and LEDs look - plasmas really do have the best image quality hands down.  To me it is still worth it.  I'll take my barely discernible marks over any over-bright, depth-lacking LCD/LED any day!White glove service was okay.

This thing is lovely - great picture, surprisingly good sound (esp. given how thin it is), and easy setup. Other folks here have detailed all the positive aspects of this set to a large degree, so I'll call out a few tips and warnings:-Upon my first power-on, the TV needed to perform a firmware update which failed a few times, despite the TV being connected via Ethernet directly to my router. No idea what the problem was, but a few tries finally got the update installed.-My set sits very, very slightly crooked - the right side is about a half-inch lower than the left (when facing the set), giving the disconcerting impression that the TV is slumping to the side. I'm going to try to re-seat it on the stand - I'll update my review if that corrects the issue. I don't find it very noticeable, but it drives my wife bonkers.-When I connected my PS3 via HDMI, the picture was \"glitching\" with bursts of static every second or so. I cautiously went through each of the various Display settings, until I found the option for \"Deep Color\" - once this was disabled, the glitching stopped. I've noticed nothing similar with my Xbox 360 yet.-The HDMI ports are right behind the left edge of the TV, and standard (thick) HDMI cables will be visible as they trail away from the rear-left edge. To eliminate this, I bought 3 HDMI swivel-adapters from Monoprice - these allow normal HDMI cables to rotate, effectively making them point straight back and away from the TV (and rendering them hidden to viewers).-Speaking of cables: if you want to connect anything via Composite or Component cables, you'll need to use the (included) pigtail adapter. This isn't a big deal, but the pigtail dangles below the bottom edge of the TV, which is visually annoying and cluttered. I'm going to use some electrical tape (or something similar) to prevent the adapter from dangling below the TV.-The remote is nice, as far as they go. However, the buttons seem extremely sensitive to being pressed - even just setting the remote down gently on the couch buttons-down will often trigger random button-presses. Their iOS app is great, though, so I'm not using the hardware remote very much.I'm only a few days in, and I can admit that after years with a flaky Mitsu DLP, any modern HTDV would probably look amazing. Still, I'm super, super happy with this TV - the picture is fantastic, the sound is surprisingly adequate, and the annoyances and quibbles above aren't nearly enough to really detract from the whole experience.

I always want the best product for the money and in this case I would have to say I made the right choice.The picture is perfect (videophile-level).  I couldn't be more pleased with the picture. The sound quality is just average (the reason I only gave 4 and not 5 stars). Personally, I didn't care about the sound as I have the set hooked up to a home theater system. But for those looking to purchase a TV and don't have this option I would go to the store and take the TV for a test run. Actually I would recommend doing this for picture quality as well just so that you can see the difference for yourself.Complaints I have read about this product(1) only 3 HDMI ports.Retort:  if you have a receiver controlling all of your electronics  you should never need more than this anyway(2) does not come with 3D eyewearRetort: The TV was by far the best bang for your buck even after considering the cost of the 3D glasses(3) The advanced setup doesn't offer as many customizations as other TVsRetort: This is true (when you compare to high end and higher price TVs). But at some point you are really splitting hairs when it comes to picture. I was able to get an amazing picture using the customization options available.Other notes.I originally bought this TV from Best Buy and had a terrible experience. The TV died after 4 days and then Best Buy gave me the run around about getting a new TV. I spent 2-3 hours on the phone being transferred from one place to another as no one had the \"authority\" to send someone out and get TV. There is actually a lot more to the story but it is not applicable to my purchase here. The point is that I learned my lesson and will always purchase from Amazon. I have never had any problem with a return of any kind. I knew that this was the TV I wanted, there was noway that all of the reading I did about TV's and all of the consumer reviews were going to make me shy away from this TV just because I happened to get the one lemon. And as it turned out I was able to get this TV (plus the 4 year 4 square warranty)  for $50 less than just the TV price at Best Buy. I may have had to suffer through 2+ weeks of no TV hell, but it was well worth it.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Making it hard to wanna return", "Author": "Mac24", "ReviewID": "R2BY15V07KG9WY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, let me say that I went into this with the intention to battle test it and decide if it was for me. I'm a big sports guy ; football, boxing and Lakers baby. I read every review I could and pulled the trigger after about a month of research. I had purchased an LG 6700 and did not like the pic quality , so decided to return but once I scheduled the pick up the pic quality drastically improved after major tinkering with settings (some flash lighting but only with black screen & no pic) could not tell when watching anything.  But already decided to return and if anything would rather get the step up 55\" 7600. Now to the ST50 , decided against the \"slide break in\" didn't have time to waste only had 30days to decide to keep and test image retention. Anyways read that break in with slides didn't really help to prevent IR but rather helping for calibration.First thing, I was concerned about the brightness of this set after reading reviews about it being dim, thats just crap these people must of had it on standard, or been wearing sunglasses while watching. Love the color on this set , was running it on standard HBO HD when sleeping & cinema while watching. The main reason of returning the LG was the dimness of the set, the ST destroys the LG with its out the box setting. Next thing the infamous buzzing lucky for me no problem there or at least I can't hear it , also read that the TV gets hot & releases heat again haven't experience that and I have the TV on about 16 hours a day for three consecutive weeks now. So those problems are debunked personally by me at least with this set. Now to the burn in or image retention issues which were my biggest fears with this set. Again I watch a lot of sports & history channel , regardless of that just about every channel has a static logo on it. When it comes to that the set has showed minor image retention. But goes away with time and you can't see it unless you are starring at it  from 1 foot away.Now to the performance looks good on blue ray but what TV doesn't , HD channels are okay, LG' s might be slightly better, and yes blacks are black on this set compared to LG's blackish gray but not a deal breaker for me, I watch sports. To that point Football looks amazing on this set so does boxing, better than the LG . But my favorite sport basketball not so great. The LG looked pretty good and didn't have a problem with motion blur like the ST 50 does, first I thought it might be my HDMI'S since I purchased them with my Samsung back in 07' so I bought new high speed ones slight improvement but didn't fix the choppiness. It happens a lot when you watch basketball, I thought it might be the channel so I waited for TNT' broadcast which is by far the best looking and sadly it didn't improve. It mainly happens when the camera pans out, or when showing replays, also when images change from one scene to another. You can see all the pixels & the pic becomes blocky, I thought that the 600hz prevented this from happening if anybody can give me advice on whats going on then this TV is a keeper . But i might keep it anyways I only have a few more days till it hits 30. For some reason I wanna give the LG a second try and get the 55\" beauty and not worry about image retention , or worry about how long i play video games or falling asleep with the TV on. I'm being eaten alive about this decision , i don't wanna return this set since it doesn't  have none of those problems other sets do & if i do return and buy later i might get one of those bad sets.I can't make up my mind . Well I will decide eventually and update on my tv status .", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "magusandfrog", "ReviewID": "R27EEEU2OF18D2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV looks great and was a very simple setup process.

Of course, the proof would be in the actual use, as reviews don't always tell the story. So first, I actually purchased the tv one week before I moved and scheduled delivery for a week later on moving day. The driver showed up early with the tv, plugged it in to make sure it worked and because I was not home, did not bother to take the box or offer to connect it to the stand, which has been the case with the previous 2 tvs I bought via amazon.The TV itself is sharp, darker than I was used to with my LED tv, also the first plasma I have ever owned, but when it came time to watch a horror film, with lots of darkness on-screen, it was nice to see such a solid use of dark colors minus the obvious artifacts that my Samsung 55inch led tv has when viewing darker films.It features 3 hdmi connections, a port for the old hd through component and one optical audio, which was a bit bare, but exactly what I needed for my setup. The tv setup was easy and it was able to recognize my Samsung home theater and change the volume on it by itself which was a nice little touch. The smart tv apps were decent and about what you would expect, although I wish Cox would get on board the HB2GO train already. Still having amazon instant video with access to my amazon library was a nice touch and makes me far more likely to take amazon digital copies as it would negate me having to use my Apple tv.My video game systems worked without issue, although I do recommend spending some time at the calibration sites to find settings that work for you. Thus far I have been judicious with shutting the tv off anytime I am not in front of it, as well as never leaving anything paused on the screen. I simply have no desire to run my tv on some pattern for 200 hours and am going to attempt to just nurse it past the major burn-in period.It is a bummer that a 3d tv does not come with 3d glasses, but upon purchasing a pair, I was happy to see that they worked well. Panasonic hypes this 2d to 3d conversion function which works, but not as well as content that is natively transmitted in 3d. Not sure how often I will use it, but it works well.Ultimately for $1099.00, I feel I got a solid tv and tremendous value. I certainly could have sprung for a 55 or larger, but the 50 inch is perfect for my man-cave needs.

When I checked out this TV at local BestBuy, as usual on their bright lit floor, it did not look great standing next to other LEDs. Picture seemed dull and washed out.Somehow I made up my mind to trust the reviews and bought this last week from Amazon (Got it for $1000 with White Glove delivery, by doing a price match with Pauls TV). Delivery was prompt. I did 100 hour slide show prep using D-Nice's settings on HD Junkies forum and have been using the TV for the past 2 days with his Custom settings. Wow!!!

Panasonic used to be a high quality brand, but parts and service quality has slipped a great deal.  I have since read reports on >2007 Panasonic power boards going out - in our case it took the rest of the just-out-of-warranty system with it.In 2010 we bought a GT-series Panasonic plasma, and it spontaneously broke (normal on-off operation, light use 2 hrs/day) last month.  Panasonic suggested that they might pay for the repair if they knew what it was.  They instructed us to take it to a service center for assessment - there was a nonrefundable $100 assessment charge which was payable immediately.The service center determined that a board had burned out and needed to be replaced at a total cost of $400.  We did not like this but agreed to the repair when Panasonic kicked in ~$100.  The service center replaced the board and then found two more boards had also burned out at a total cost of $650.  Needless to say we were not happy - I would have just thrown away the television if I knew their boards are designed to burn out in tandem.  I've since read other user complaints online that look identical to my situation:  three boards, $650 repair cost.When we contacted Panasonic service, they first claimed that this is the \"normal\" lifetime and then when I said I would document that online, they then retracted and said it was \"not normal\" behavior for this television.  In either case they feel they don't have any responsibility for fixing it.  After hours on the phone, they refused to cover more parts or labor and could not pass our situation on to higher up managers that might be able to solve this.  They also said that there is no guarantee on Panasonic provided boards, so in the case they provided new boards that also went bad, we would have to go back to the service center and pay for another repair.Currently, we are out a television for about a month and we can't even throw it away without paying the Panasonic-recommended service center for repairs to date.

My wife and I debated the merits of plasma vs. LCD's and ended up diving into the plasma arena.  After a good week of viewing a lot of different content and playing some games, I can say that we are truly happy that we chose plasma over LCD.  Sure you may be able to find an LCD that performs near these Panasonic plasmas but, they will be far more expensive, especially for the size.Pros:Picture quality - Color, blacks, clarity, contrast and even brightness are all phenomenal.Sound - It's not surround quality but, when you want to watch a movie, sports or another performance, you will be using your auxiliary sound system anyway.  For regular broadcast TV viewing, the speakers are more than adequate.  Their balance of highs and lows is even enough to not sound muddy.  Actually I'd call them impressive considering the thickness of this set.Cons:Heat/power - Is estimated to use twice that of a comparable LCD.  Also, this thing is a furnace so if you are worried about heat in the room this will be in I would stay away.Inputs - There are only three HDMI inputs as opposed to the four that are on most competing units.ST50 vs. ST60:We settled on the previous model year because of fear of input lag.  The ST50 of 2012 is tested to have almost half of the input lag of the ST60 of 2013 (as per HDTVtest UK 47ms vs. 75ms).  Although I was not able to see if this was truly a problem, we played it safe by going with the more sure bet.  From everything that I have read, this additional lag is caused by the increased number of processes running in the background for the smart features even while running in game mode.  On top of that, the response that some forum members have gotten from Panasonic is that there will be no firmware update to remedy the issue.  The biggest trade off from my point of view was that we weren't going to receive two pairs of 3D glasses.  Since we didn't buy this for its 3D capabilities it was not a big deal (though I would love to watch Tron in 3D someday).Hockey:I read an awful lot of complaining about hockey on plasmas and specifically this TV.  Any and all of these fears are unfounded to me.  After watching the first four 2013 Stanley Cup Final games, I have no reservations recommending this set.Automatic brightness: Apparently when on the standard setting, when the camera is panning across the ice, the brightness would jump up and down causing an irritating effect.  I have had the picture set on the custom mode since I have owned it and have not experienced this at all.Strobe flashes: Before the ST50 arrived, I started looking for this while watching hockey on our CRT and sure enough experienced this exact phenomenon so I wasn't surprised to see it appear on the new set.  It is definitely more pronounced on the larger set but did not distract me or anyone else that has watched the SCF's during regular hockey nights at our house.My settings:Other than the color temperature, I was very happy with most of the settings posted around the web.  CNET's and D-nice's among others seem to work pretty well for me.  I haven't found a Blu-Ray that I own that can do what the old Star Wars DVD's do, so I used their THX optimizer slides.  I will also use some of the slides from AVSForum in the future to further fine tune it.  On the temperature, the Warm2 setting produced too much of a red/orange tint on whites for me, especially for hockey which I watch frequently.  I am trying to settle in the middle with Warm1 until I can get accustomed to the ~6500K and it might work better for movies than broadcast.  Also since most friend's and family member's TV's are set cooler, the temperature will look off to them when they visit and their sets will look off to us when we visit them.  I may have to tough it out though and get used to a more accurately calibrated set.-|Picture|-Picture mode: CustomContrast: +80Brightness: +60Color: +45Tint: 0Sharpness: 0Color temp: NormalColor mgmt: Off [grayed out]C.A.T.S.: OffVideo NR: Off-|Pro settings|-Color space: Warm1W/B high R: +2W/B high G: 0W/B high B: +1W/B low R: +8W/B low G: 0W/B low B: -1Black extension: 0Gamma adjustment: 2.6Panel brightness: MidContour emphasis: OffAGC: 0The rest I have set the same as the other guys.If you are still undecided on plasma vs. LCD, the basic option is that you can either play it safe and go LCD or you can go for exceptional picture quality and jump into a plasma (unless you pay a lot more for a comparable LCD).  I may not have owned it for long but we have not experienced any image retention (IR) or burn in yet.  I will update this review if the situation changes.  I will say that I did run some panel prep slides and watched pretty diverse content for the first 100 hours.  I did not run the slides 100 hours straight, only in between regular viewing so I didn't follow the strict recommendations.  I don't know how much any of this will make a difference but I doubt that it did any harm and it didn't inconvenience our viewing habits.  Only time will tell if it helped.In my opinion, get this set and you won't regret it.

I read every review I could read on the first 10 pages of a \"best HDTV under 1000\" Google search.  I finally narrowed my decision down to the Vizio 601I-A3, the Samsung 51E550, and the Panasonic P50ST50.  All three seem to get really good reviews, and the choice for me came down to one consistent theme... best picture quality.  Samsung has a better 'smart' interface, and if I went with the Vizio I could have gotten a 60\" LED for the same price as the 50\" Panasonic plasma, or 51\" Samsung plasma.  According to (virtually) every review I read, the Panasonic ST50 series is best in class.  I finally decided to pull the trigger when I saw it on Prime for 949.00 with free shipping and no tax.  After it arrived (10 degrees outside) I let it sit for a few hours before plugging it in.  After doing the initial setup I plugged in a Blu Ray (Inception) and watched it with the out-of-box cinema mode.WOW!  Absolutely unbelievable.  I have very little understanding of the technical terms used in describing anything (for that I recommend CNET or AVS forums).  I was blown away by how clear and deep the images looked.  It was worth every penny of the purchase, and I couldn't be happier.Things to know about my setup:- Dark room with no windows or ambient lighting of any kind (basement home theater)- I have the 50\" inch version, so I can't speak for the other sizes.- My previous TV is a 42\" Vizio LCD from 2008 model year.- I also bought a \"Mount-It!\" flat panel wall mount for the display", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Jeff Foss", "ReviewID": "R1I4PL5XUFWENU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Performance, setup, picture and features all work as advertised.

My only complaints about the TV is that it doesn't come with 3D glasses(the new ST60 does) and it didn't come with a HDMI cable (minor issue) . I was also shocked at how thin the TV was, Lastly, the USB ports on the side are an awesome feature, I can put movie files saved on my computer on a USB , plug it into the TV, and watch it with no problems.I also cant say enough about the enhanced delivery, the two guys from Ceva brought the TV up two flights of stairs to my gaming room, unboxed it, installed the stand, plugged the TV up and turned it on, checked for cracks, and made sure it had no issues with the pixels and made sure I was happy with it before they left.

Prices had come down enough that we thought it is time to upgrade.  We were amazed by the picture quality of HD Cable TV.  I choose this set after reading many reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere.  At first I was apprehensive about getting a Plasma, but after reading technical articles, I found my fears were unfounded.  Fear #1 Plasma will get dull over time.  True, but the time is 100,000 hrs or 30 years.  Fear #2 Plasma will burn in a static image, like black bars on top and bottom when watching movies or the channel logo at the bottom.  The set has an anti-aliasing feature, which is supposed to prevent it.  I have not seen any evidence of burn-in after considerable use for three weeks.Bought this set for its picture quality and YES, it is awesome compared to my friends with LCD sets.  Further more, it can be watched from an angle with the same picture quality.I have several input devices, among them a Wii using Component Video (Red Green Blue wires), a DVD player using Component Video and a Personal Video Recorder using HDMI.  They all work great and it is easy to switch between them with the remote.  For the Wii and DVD Player I bought a Component Video Switch.  This allows both of them to use a single Component Video input on the TV.Have not tried the 3D feature, because it did not include a set of 3D glasses.  Panasonic sells them for a hefty price.  Compatible glasses can be gotten elsewhere for half the price.  Also a Blue Ray player is needed for 3D, which I do not have yet.Setup and installation is easy.  Decided to hang it on the wall.  Purchased a bracket from 3rd party, which screwed into wall studs with 6 hefty screws.  Made sure it was absolutely level.  Mounted another bracket on back of the TV.  Then had someone help me lift it and hook it onto the wall bracket.  Then locked it in with two set screws.  Could possibly have lifted it myself, but why take a chance with an expensive piece of equipment?TV is connected to the Internet with an Ethernet wire.  Looked at the apps that come with the TV.  Most of them I have no need for except maybe Nextflix.  You will need to have a Nexflix streaming membership for it to work.  Popped in an SD card from my camera and it does a slide show.  Has several slide show options.My TV audio goes into a surround amplifier, using the digital fiber audio output.  Get great stereo sound that way.

At first, it seemed that the TV was working okay. The setup went fine, and it connected to my wireless network. After the delivery people left, I noticed that the TV wasn't on, and the red power light was blinking. From then on, every time I powered on the TV, it would shut off within one to two minutes. I talked to Amazon and Panasonic and decided to let Panasonic try to fix the unit. The Panasonic technician came one week later (the earliest possible appointment). He replaced three circuit boards. That fixed the spontaneous power-off problem. However, I then noticed that the TV would rarely connect to my wireless network. All the other devices in my house (two computers, two iPhones, one printer, and one Apple TV) have no problems connecting to the network. My router can even see the TV on its network, but the TV can't connect. I called Panasonic. They had me try some things that didn't help. I was told my problem was being elevated to a higher level of technical support. When they called back, that happened to be one of the rare times (about one out of every ten) when the TV successfully connected to the network. They told me to wait at least 5 minuets after turning on the TV to allow it to connect. The connection problems have continued.

We're only playing DVDs, stream Netflix/YouTube, and watch Zakaria's GPS on CNN but I finally stepped into the 21st century and I've bought this ST50.InstallationI'm pretty techy so I've setup everything easily from unboxing to mounting, calibration, Wi-Fi connection, etc. No problems.First impressionWhat the hell is this? Is it broken? Let me explain:1. Posterization. All plasmas have this problem of granulation / noise problem / dancing pixels, which is called Posterization. Read about it here [...] and here [...]. Basically when you have less than ideal sources -- which happens 98% of the time -- and you're close to the screen, you'll get this effect.I was 3 ft away from the TV and I thought it's broken. Even with the best source (1080p image) you can see this thing. However, go further away form the screen (like 5 ft) and it's gone, you cannot see it anymore.2. Line bleeding. Read about it here [...] Basically you'll see this at the rating screen before trailers and movies (the green background with white fonts) and in some other cases. There's no way you can get rid of it, it's another plasma characteristic.3. This one doesn't bother me but I'll mention it because I read about it in otherreviews: Buzzing. Yes, it does buzz. The brighter the image, the louder it gets. Can you hear it? Only if it's complete silence and you are closer than 6 ft. In other words, no, you don't hear it unless you have three ears.I've noticed these issues in the first minutes of operation and I was bent on sending it back to Amazon because the first two. I'm used to computer LCDs which are perfect, no matter how close you are to the screen, so I thought this is true for plasmas as well. After doing some reading it turns out it's not like that.I quickly drove to a nearby Frys and examined a few of the TVs on display. The LCDs didn't exhibit any of the three issues, but the colors were more artificial and unrealistic. However ALL the plasmas had the same issues as mine, more or less.ConclusionI'll keep it. Watching it in normal conditions (from the couch, 6 ft away) the quality it's amazing. You cannot see the posterization and the line bleeding it's very rare. There is no audible buzzing. Super deep blacks, excellent brightness when you need it. Very little reflection. No motion problems. I'm very happy and I would def. recommend it.Hope this helps other paranoids out there. And sorry for my poor English, it's not my first language. Plus the effects a generous glass of Malibu Rum with Pepsi Max :D", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great overall purchase", "Author": "CJ", "ReviewID": "R1RKP9L18NNKI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy great price.

I did a lot of research, but was still going back and forth between LED/LCD TVs and Plasmas.Picture: Absolutely stunning. It really is. There are quite a few settings that you can adjust to really get the image you want. But have no fear. This baby can and will be bright, clear, and beautiful. The one thing that annoys me about newer TV's, I was able to turn off: Motion Smoothing. Many films and TV shows are naturally filmed with a specific motion blur that is considered the most attractive viewing experience. Having that taken back out by MOTION SMOOTHING, makes the image look fake, and CG images look comical. But no worries! You can turn it off (it actually has 4 settings: Off, Weak, Medium, Strong). Access it while viewing an image by going to Menu>Picture>Advandced Picture(on third page)>Motion Smoother.Hooking it up to your computer and worried about Plasma images burning in? You shouldn't be: Plasma technology has come a long way in a short period of time. This TV has a ton of features that keep any type of \"plasma burn\" totally at bay. If an image stays on the screen, stationary (computer hooked up, internet browsing), after a few minutes the image will start spinning around. There's also a timer you can set, to turn the TV off after a set length of time without interaction. Great for watching a movie that you might fall asleep to.SmartTV Features: They're actually pretty darn cool if you use Netflix, Hulu, and AmazonPrime. It actually pretty much eliminates the need to hook it up to your computer. So think about that. And if you have a good wireless router, and a good cable modem, the Wireless is absolutely fast enough to stream HD content. Yes, I still suggest a network cable, because its faster. Period.Set-up: Easy. Enough said.Form Factor: Awesome. Very thin, easily wall-mountable if that's your thing. Stock stand is relatively sturdy, and easy to assemble. The whole TV design is very nice.Speakers: You don't need to hook it up to a sound system. But you'd be crazy not to if you're buying a TV this good and then plan on just using the built in speakers.All in all, I highly recommend it!

It's been a long time since I've bought a new TV and I'm glad I waited. LED looked great, but too many reviews led me towards plasma, and CNET of course swayed me toward this particular model. My budget was met with this TV.The goods: Built-in-wifi, anti-glare coating, great picture.Things I don't care about: smart-tv and 3d. I've played with the smart apps, and Netflix app looks pretty good, but I still prefer AppleTV's interface. I don't think the smart functions should be built-in to the TV and keep them on external devices. Easier to upgrade over the years. I also have no idea why someone wants 3d in their house, but to each their own. Maybe we'll splurge and buy some glasses just to try it out.The disappointments: Built-in banner ad on startup of tv, and the smart tv menu has an ad spot. Both are easy to remove, but come on Panasonic, what meeting made you decide that was a good idea? Thank you for letting us easily disable it. The TV has a buzz at times that bothers us, but it's not a deal-breaker since it only happens primarily with Apple TV on the main menu. Why is this? Who knows.I wish we didn't have to upgrade our surround sound, as the antenna input doesn't transmit sound to our receiver, since it's running through a digital to analog converter.That was long-winded, but if you have a budget around $1000 and want a great tv, go this route.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome.

Styling is good and improved over prior Panasonic plasma televisions.CONS: Only two HDMI ports. No analog sound output - only digital. This is a bit of deal for me because it makes attaching a headphone a bit more expensive an inconvenient and I need headphones if I don't want to get complaints at night. Power use is a bit on the piggy side.CONCLUSION: For the price it is just about the best thing out there. To get a better picture you are going to have to pay more - sometimes a lot more. I am very happy with the purchase. While the TC-P50ST50 isn't inexpensive, for the money (paid $1,099 for this with Prime free shipping) there are few if any equals at anywhere near the price and size.

From the numerous reviews and positive feedback I've received, I knew this was the TV for my current situation. Shipping was quick (secondary shipper) and they even offered installation (I opted out, I was able to do it myself). TV was neatly packaged and there wasn't even cosmetic damage to the packaging itself, so I knew the shippers handled it with care. Pulled the TV out of the box, set the stand up, and began the quick start setup.Here is where the problem occurred . At about the time I got to the Auto Scan (didn't get a SAT box for this room yet) the TV shut off. I just assumed that the TV had finished its \"scan\" and was self resetting. Then the picture didn't come back on for about 3 minutes, I got concerned. So naturally, I unplugged the TV's power supply and let it sit for about 5mins. Plugged it back in, the TV \"clicked\" as to let me know that it was receiving power and then I pressed the power button, NO PICTURE! The power LED located under the TV blinked several times (Panasonic's diag. code) and I proceeded to search this problem online. Turns out, it means a bad circuit board. Called Amazon customer support. They transferred me to tech, explained to him the exact problems and the at home trouble shooting I already did. Tells me I need a new TV. Transfers me back to customer support and says the new TV will be here in two days. I said \"Ok, what about some compensation?\" She said \"I can give you $50 for the trouble\" I asked \"What about money for TWO pairs of 3D Glasses?\" she put me on hold. \"I can give you $150.\" I said \"Ok, thanks for that. I'll be in touch if i have any other problems.\"So the TV itself for now, will get a 2 Star rating, based off of first impressions.Update to come when new TV arrives on 3/22/13Sorry about the delay in the update!!!!!!New TV arrived, this time I opted for \"White Glove Service\" as Ceva calls it. They were very courteous and polite.No problem with the TV thus far.

I have the new TV set up in my bedroom and most of the time the light is very controlled(not a ton of light). I have included a couple of settings below for cable television(I currently have Verizon) and Blu-rays. Since each input can be calibrated separately this won't be an issue just make sure the settings are saved. The two are a little different as I have found the cable comes across much darker than any of the Blu-rays I have used. I like my picture a little brighter so my settings reflect that fact. I took the first set from Cnet and have found the picture incredible while watching \"Rome\". Overall a little darker than I was use to but the colors are just amazing. The second set were helped by a review by Gregorian on this site but were totally revamped after my set was broken in.(from Cnet)Blu-ray: ------------------ My own tweaks for Verizon Cable TV:Picture mode: Custom -------------------- CustomContrast: 82 ----------------------------- 80Brightness: 60 -------------------------- 42Color: 46 -------------------------------- 42Tint: 0 ----------------------------------- 0Sharpness: 0 --------------------------- 40(just what I use but most discourage its use)Color Temp: Warm2 ------------------- Warm2Color mgmt: Grayed out on off --------- Off/grayed outC.A.T.S.: Off ---- ------------------------ OffVideo NR: Off ---------------------------- OffClick on Pro Settings menuColor space: Normal -------------------- Wide(another of my tweeks, color looks better IMHO)High R: +10 ---------------------------- -10High G: 0 ---- ---- ----------------------- 0High B: +3 ---- ---- -------------------- +3Low R: +4 ---- ------------------------- -5Low G: 0 ---- ---------------------------- 0Low B: -2 ---- -------------------------- -2Black extension: 0 ------------------------- 0Gamma adjustment: 2.6 ------------------ 2.4(another way to lighten without white faces)Panel brightness: Mid --------------------- High(whites tend to bloom but overall picture looks closer to my old LCD)Contour emphasis: Off -------------------- OffAGC: 0 ----- ------------------------------- 0(adjust on your own this is key)Aspect adjustmentsScreen format: Full ---------------------- FullHD size: Size 2 ---- ----------------------- 2HDMI settings menu leave as isAdvanced pictureBlock NR: Off ---- --------------------------- OffMosquito NR: Off ----- ---------------------- OffMotion smoother: Off -------------------- Weak(I am a big sports fan and this helps)Black level: Light ----- -------------------- Light3:2 pulldown: On -------------------------- OnHope this helps and the key is to monkey around with it until you get what you're looking for. Most of your inputs will display a slightly different picture so tweak until it suits you. DON'T FORGET TO SAVE YOUR SETTINGS IN EACH INPUT WHEN YOU ADJUST THE PICTURE OR THEY WILL BE LOST UPON RESTART. As I mentioned earlier I would like to thank user \"Gregorian\" for his settings I borrowed and made my own adjustments early in the process but later completely changed to meet my own needs.Love the picture and quality of the set but my one complaint is the sound. Please do yourself a huge favor and purchase either a sound bar or a home theater setup. The speakers on this set sound like they are in the next room coming through the wall. Really bad but what do you expect with about 1 1/2 inches of room?Sorry about the terrible formatting as Amazon changed my text setup and took out any spaces I had left.UPDATE 3/4 I kind of glossed over this but when initially using the set you might want to make sure you are watching programming that fills the entire screen without a lot of static images for the first 100 hours or so. In other words avoid sports with stationary info bars(score of the game) or tickers at the bottom of the screen. Movies or television programs with black bars on the sides or bottoms are also not recommended. So no ESPN or CNN for a couple of weeks, lol. I watched \"Rome\" which is in the 1.85:1 and regular TV shows that filled my entire TV to break in my set. I know some posters have mentioned slides or other ways of breaking in your TV but as long as you are not playing video games with the contrast up over 85 you should be fine. Just a heads up to be safe.I am knocking off a star on my original review based purely on the terrible sound. I would really only take half a star off if I could(total of 4.5). I have ordered a sound bar and am sure this will solve that problem. Just a heads up to anyone looking for a second TV in a bedroom like myself where a home theater option is not viable. One other thing, on my set I noticed 2 tiny screen chips(size of a small pin head) on the glass while changing a disc. The only reason I even saw them was because I was so close to the glass and it was a solid pattern on the screen. Make sure you really inspect your screen to make sure you don't have the same issue. The box was in perfect shape when it arrived so it had to have happened at the factory. I called Amazon and they game me a 15% credit for keeping it. My gain because any further than about 3 feet and the dings/chips are invisible. Really strange and still wondering how it happened. You could see little bits of glass dust near the two chips I had to carefully wipe away. Any other issues concerns I will update again. The picture is just fantastic and I had never really noticed how different most cable station's broadcasts look. I wonder if over the air 1080p will ever happen?UPDATE 3/7 I just want to add that this TV does not come with a headphone jack. You either need a receiver or a digital convertor like this one: DB Tech Digital to Analog Audio Converter with Digital Optical Toslink and S/PDIF Coaxial Inputs and Analog RCA and AUX 3.5mm (Headphone) Outputs - 6 foot Heavy Duty Optical Toslink Cable with Gold Plated Connector Tips Included. Please be aware the volume will not be adjustable. Works at a medium volume and is fine for listening. Receiver and headphones might be a better option if volume adjustment is important. Not sure why Panasonic couldn't come through for those of us who have this in their bedroom but whatever.UPDATE 3/11 I've had the set for a few weeks and updated my own custom settings. I changed the panel brightness to high and lowered the color, brightness, contrast to compensate. I really like the picture very bright and this looks the best for me for over the air broadcasts. The only issue is that whites tend to bloom occasionally especially with standard definition content and the reds tend to be a little strong. These settings are almost perfect for anyone use to the brightness of an LCD as I have been the past 5 or so years. The picture on this plasma(as well as most I have seen) always looked too dark for me whether it was with the Cnet settings or Dnice or even most of my own changes. Turning the panel brightness to \"High\" solved most of these darkness issues. But, as I said to each their own and maybe my cable might be a little different where the brightness/darkness is concerned. My Blu-ray settings remain unchanged as the 1080p looks so much different than the Verizon picture. As I have said before and am saying again do yourself a favor and just adjust the picture based on your own needs. I tried 5 or 6 different user/expert settings that just didn't work for me. As everyone knows these plasmas age/break in differently thus the need to have them calibrated professionally or by trial and error.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture and functionality, but one nit", "Author": "jesseV", "ReviewID": "R12O8YC5BY7Q3X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture quality right out of the box was disappointing, but after modifying the settings as per CNET's recommendations, we are very pleased with color and sharpness--even non-HD inputs produce a quality image. The wi-fi setup worked quickly, and an HD movie from Amazon Prime played excellently, without a stop or a stutter. Just tried inserting the SD card from my camera into the slot in the back, and now have a slideshow playing (much nicer than watching on a computer screen or tablet). Haven't tried 3D yet, but am in no hurry.  Sound quality from the speakers is quite adequate for much programming, but by and large we feed the sound output via optical cable to our AV receiver, so when we want the best sound, such as for movies, we can rattle the windows.The only nit is one mentioned in several other reviews, and that is a moderate buzzing sound that is most apparent when the picture is very bright and white (e.g., the sound is most audible if the picture is of snow, sky, white clothing, etc., and pretty minor when the scene is darker). You wouldn't notice it when the volume is up and there is dialogue, music, etc., but when the volume is low, which is often how we set it, you may become aware of it, if not annoyed. I spent some time on the phone with the Panasonic warranty/service rep, who told me that the buzzing is \"normal,\" and who seemed to suggest that I was sort of the problem because I like to have the volume on low settings.

The TV is in immaculate quality and the picture is unexplainable.When setting up the picture setting I used the custom calibration guidelines found on CNET and I found that contrary to those guidelines I prefer the motion smoothing feature strongly enabled to create that crisp almost more than lifelike picture that I had read about.  I also purchased at another store a Panasonic blu ray player and the two together function flawlessly.

I put the bass and treble up to +15 and the volume control always gives me sound as loud as I want.Picture and sound quality and size are, of course, the most important factors in deciding whether to buy a tv, and the Panasonic ST series should please just about anybody on all three counts.  I do have some minor complaints.  First, Flash video format is not supported on this tv.  If you're using the built-in web browser to surf the Net for videos, you'll be disappointed because most web sites, it seems, use the Flash format for video playback.  The tv does make up for this lack with Youtube and other video apps, through which countless videos can be watched.The 3D feature on this tv works great with Blu-ray 3D discs, which I play on a Panasonic Blu-ray 3D player.  However, the 2D-to-3D conversion feature is disappointing.  Images don't pop out much or achieve the kind of depth that you can get on Blu-ray 3D discs.  I can't say if this feature is any better or worse than that found on competing tv sets.  In any case, the 2D picture is outstanding.If you plan to do much surfing on the Net, I recommend buying a wireless keyboard.  Typing search terms or internet addresses will be much easier this way than using the arrow keys on the Panasonic remote control to spell out search terms or addresses.Another small disappointment for me is that headphones can't be plugged directly into the tv.  You have to attach a digital-to-analog audio converter to the tv first--a fairly expensive gadget--or spend a lot more money to attach a receiver.  There are no analog audio outputs for directly attaching an older mini-stereo system you might have.  Apparently, this is true of most tv sets now.  Why can't manufacturers simply include a headphone jack along with all the other connectors they build into tv sets these days?Although my complaints have taken up more space than my commendations, I want to emphasize in conclusion that I'm really pleased with this tv, and I think you will be, too.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic picture....", "Author": "Umesh \"Umesh\"", "ReviewID": "R2MJOJ4VQJU1K5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this refurb, but it appears to be brand new...The picture quality is top notch of course - It is worth 5 stars.The 4 star rating is for Amazon shipping me a component cable that that is non-functional.

I did get it to be what I thought was the best it could be, but that was not better than that of my defunct 720p plasma with 1080i up-conversion.But that was only if watching it straight from the front. As soon as you moved right or left, the picture quality got lousy pretty quickly. And then there is the motion blurr thing- quite annoying. I tried to live with it for a while, but could not get used to it and took it back.So after another search on what was available, it seemed like the Panasonic 50 ST was the closest to what I was looking for.The downside, especially for Best Buy, was that they did not have it in stock an dcould not tell me when they would (maybe another sympton of their struggle to compete), so I ended up ordering it from Amazon.

After less than six weeks, the screen displayed a burn-in image of the Fox Business Network information bar across the bottom. (I had watched \u201cImus in the Morning\u201d on FBN Monday through Friday from 6 am-9 am, but at no other time.)I contacted Panasonic customer service and was advised that a local service provider (XP Electronics in Nashua, N.H.) would need to examine the set. Two days later, an highly professional XP tech examined the set, confirming in a report to Panasonic that \u201cthe unit has permanent \u2018burn in\u2019 damage to PDP panel assembly. Fox News Channel logo (sic) and ticker burnt in at bottom of screen. This issue is not covered thru mfg. warranty. Please note: issue is not image retention. Plasma panel would need to be replaced!\u201dOver the next six weeks, I spoke with a parade of Panasonic customer service reps and supervisors: Nigel, Lorenzo, Omar, Allison, Orlando and Trisha (they are not \u201cpermitted\u201d to give last names, probably so they can\u2019t be re-contacted or held accountable.) At every step in the process I was given inaccurate, conflicting and misleading information regarding the status of my complaint, apologies about the actions of the previous, and a promise to rectify that and be in touch with me within 72 hours. In not a single instance did I receive a return call within a week; in every case, I had to re-initiate contact.Ultimately, I was informed that burn-in is specifically excluded from Panasonic\u2019s warranty and that the company would do nothing to resolve the issue. (Note that Panasonic\u2019s Canadian warranty does not exclude burn-in. My guess is the Canadian regulators would not permit it.)My final contact was with Arlene in the company\u2019s customer relations department at Panasonic USA headquarters in Secaucus, N.J. She acknowledged the total lack of competent handling of my complaint, but reiterated the company\u2019s stand that the problem was not covered by warranty and would not be repaired or replaced.While she refused to go on record agreeing with the following statement (though offering nothing to rebut it), I can only draw this conclusion: Panasonic believes it is normal and acceptable for its plasma televisions to experience burn-in within six weeks on a new TV that has been used strictly in accordance with all the recommendations and information provided in the product\u2019s user guide.With policies like that, one can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s not a good thing that Panasonic is exiting the plasma TV business.

It is by far the best picture I have ever seen.  It is replacing a 7 year old Sharp Aquos 52\" LCD television, and wow, what a difference a few years of technology can make.  I spoke to a Television super store salesman about replacing my television a few weeks back and he convinced me to take a look at the new line of Panasonics and to give plasma another chance. He explained that major changes have occurred in plasma technology and any anxiety over a plasma for use in higher altitudes like Denver is just old news. Panasonic guarantees no burn in below 9.000 feet and for the first 100,000 hours. That is dynamite.  After seeing a similar set at the showroom, I began a search for Panasonic, and Amazon has the best price.Delivery from Amazon was a cinch and setting up the television and hooking it up to the cable box, the Blu-ray player and the Roku box was a snap.I immediately went to some of the picture settings and turned down the contrast, played with the color a bit and turned off the image smoothing and that is all the tweaking I have done. I am sure there is much more I can tweak but it doesn't seem necessary.  My old Sharp television had such a problem with reflections that I had to watch TV in a darkened room with the blinds drawn. The anti reflection on this Panasonic is so sharp that I can let the day light into the room once again.I have watched Baseball, Hockey and a re run of a college football game all in HDTV and the resolution, the color and the sharpness are wonderful. I tossed in the Fellowship of the Ring on the Blu-ray player and was stunned at the definition, the color and the beauty of the familiar movie.  I have watched Netflix and Amazon Prime movies through the Wifi connection and they were good.  Not in Blu-ray quality but pretty good HD quality for streaming.  That has more to do with the source than the television, I am sure.  I also have Roku HD box and will probably access that more than the Panasonic's Viera applications.

I can't say the same about CEVA, the delivery company, who has been nightmarish to deal with in NYC.The image has this constant shimmery fuzziness to it. The factory settings are way too dark, but even after an hour of tweaking, I simply couldn't get this brand new TV to look half as good as my 5 or 6 year old Samsung LCD. Whenever the screen shows a bright (primarily white) image, there is a loud buzz coming from the set that over powered the whirl of the DVD in my old and noisy Xbox 360.I took a walk down to the local Best Buy, a store I haven't been inside in *ages*, simply to compare sets. Don't believe what you read on CNET: Plasmas produce an image that is very different from what you're used to if you sit in front of an LCD monitor all day. All of the Plasma sets just don't look nearly as good and the Panasonic sets appear among the worst. I realize that it's hard to compare in a brightly lit big box store, but it's impossible to compare online, so at least go down there and decide for yourself how you feel about plasma before following subjective advice from the web.On the topic of delivery: CEVA's initial delivery was easily scheduled and right on time, but the delivery guys were rude and obviously in a hurry. They tried to pressure me into signing for the delivery before they even opened the box, but I refused. They then powered the TV on, still half in the box, succeeded on pressuring me into signing, and then left without assembling the stand or taking away the packaging like they were supposed to. When they came to deliver the replacement TV, they were 4 hours early and I had to run home to meet them. They refused to take back the previous delivery because they were not authorized, so now I have two TVs I don't want sitting in boxes in the living room of my small apartment.

Downloading the default flash on this page craps out.  Panasonic help chat isnt much help.  After several attempts over 3-4 weeks, I give up on this one.

LOVED that tv until my 3 year old daughter somehow cracked the screen.  Because I needed a tv fairly quickly (I couldn't watch the 27\" tube from the bedroom for long), I didn't spend as much time researching as with the previous set, but I also knew a lot more going into it this time.The clincher for me was viewing a 55\" GT50 against a 55\" Samsung 8000 with the same settings and the same Blu-ray on the screen simultaneously.  Thanks Best Buy for letting me use you for that!  Side by side, the Panasonic was clearly the winner, by a ton.  Blacker blacks, more realistic colors, etc, etc.  Now I know this isn't a GT50, but it wasn't out yet in a 60\" and the differences on paper seem to be negligible to me.  If Panasonic's #2 is better than Samsung's #1, then I figured Panasonic's #3 was good enough - and the price didn't hurt as much either.As a note, sports aren't on my tv much - but just about everything else is including a lot of blu-ray and dvd movies.The common negatives in the other reviews are things I haven't noticed - no noticable buzz, 3 hdmi inputs don't matter to me as everything goes though a Denon receiver so I only need 1.  For me, the noticable downsides are that there are considerable dark spots if I stop right in front of the tv at which point I'm looking a little down on it (viewing at a downward angle).  Not a big deal.  Also, the \"improvements\" in brightness make this too bright for my taste and I had to make a lot of adjustments to make it not look like an LCD with good blacks - and I can't stand the way LCD's generally look especially with cartoons which get a lot of play in my house - I prefer realistic to the surreal look of some blu-rays on an LCD.  If I hadn't been able to 'adjust away' the out-of-the-box picture, this tv would have most likely gone back.I started with CNet review settings and backed the sharpness back to zero to get it closer to my taste.  Turning off the motion smoother and all other processing enhancements made the final difference.  I still need to play with some of the color adjustments in the pro settings, but I can't see changing them much from where they are.  I don't remember the calibration of my Samsung making such a huge difference and I'd attribute this again to the brightness.After a couple of weeks of viewing, I'm now convinced this is better than my old Samsung - but not exponentially.  This week, the 60\" GT50 just showed up as available, but I think I saved about $500 for a very comparable tv.  Now I just need to figure out to keep the kids away from it and I'm sure I can stomach a 60\" piece of lexan!

As soon as I unpacked my Panasonic ST50, I noticed the deep blacks, great colors, and superb viewing angles. There are none of the uniformity issues that come with having a light powering the screen. I am so used to watching LCDs that it's almost a bit off-putting to see a TV that displays a picture like this. The picture obviously looks best in a room with little light - it tends to wash out just a bit when there is significant amount of light in the room. But at night, with just the standard lighting in my room - wow. It's brilliant. Thankfully, buzzing has not been an issue - I sit only about 6 feet away from the TV, but can't hear it unless I get up close. It is more noticeable if the screen is very bright - I assume this is because of the electricity being used to charge the phosphors. But even then, it's not a big deal.I tested it out with Street Fighter IV, a game I have sunk hundreds of hours into over the years on a LCD, and it was so impressive. Honestly it felt like a brand new game. The input response was so fast and the clarity of motion was superb. Other games I tried (WipeOut HD, Trials Evolution, Killzone 3) fared just as well. This is a great TV for gaming, even taking into account the downside risk of temporary image retention. I have not experienced it yet, even though I feared it would come on from playing WipeOut HD with its prominent HUD.If I had any one complaint though, it would be the 3D. So far, I have checked out a number of games and some 3D trailers. I noticed a fair amount of crosstalk on much of it. Sometimes that is due to the content, sometimes the TV - but I noticed more if it here than I did on a passive 3D system I checked out. Of course, I also noticed the higher resolution with some items. The glasses are light and chargeable and fit over my prescription glasses, so no complaints there.The Panasonic ST50 is a great TV, but of course, plasmas aren't for everyone.

Williams", "ReviewID": "R1LH95OI9EBMTB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the past few years I've been dealing with a Westinghouse 42\" LCD TV that has black levels that could best be described as \"overcast\" in color and three distinct vertical lines through the picture that are visible at all times.  I wanted to try a plasma display because everybody says they have a CRT-like picture without any of the problems of CRT's (or LCD's) - plasmas have perfect geometry, excellent screen uniformity, great-looking motion and an amazing black level.Out of the box, the TV looks pretty good but has a definite harshness to the picture.  The default settings are surprisingly *not* the \"torch mode\" that you usually see from the factory, as TV's are usually set up out of the box to look striking in a store. This TV comes set on \"standard\" mode with contrast and brightness at 50.  So it's actually pretty dim out of the box (probably to protect the new panel from unsuspecting new plasma owners), but some of the extra features applied to the picture - most likely the \"Automatic Gain Control\" and \"Black Level Compensation\" - provide artificial boosts to both the black and white areas of the picture and give it a blown-out look that can definitely induce headaches when watching for any length of time.I broke in my TV for 100 hours using solid color slides provided just for that purpose (found online) and then applied two different sets of settings I'd found to go with them.  Neither was really 100% satisfying but I did find that turning off *all* the picture enhancements - as the online settings from both D-Nice and C-Net say to do - gave me a much smoother and more \"film-like\" look, with excellent detail and black levels that are almost zero - \"inky\"!  The colors provided both by these settings and by the default settings turned out to be way too yellow, though; faces looked jaundiced and backgrounds looked like they were shot through a yellow filter.Custom mode allows adjustment to the white balance, however, and some tweaking to the level of blue brought things to a more lifelike appearance.  I feel like my set is still not quite there, and I'll need to at least run through a calibration disc or even spring for an ISF calibration to get things really right.  But when watching film-based content, at least, the experience is very much like being in a theater.  The black level, appearance of motion, etc. just look a lot like film really does.  On TV-based content, the results are more mixed, and I still feel like the set looks a little too harsh and contrasty sometimes, especially with anything obviously shot on video - even HD video (e.g. any recent reality show).  This may just be due to the technology, as this is my first plasma set.One quick thing about the black level - you really only benefit from it at night in a dark room. The black level can only be as black as the panel is, and during the day the panel itself appears grey, making the picture look a little washed out. At night, with the lights low, the panel itself is very dark and the set really shows what it can do in reproducing black.After all the trouble I've gone to, the question is would a random layperson be satisfied just with the out of the box settings?  After all, most people won't go to the trouble I have.  The answer is I don't know - probably.  I had put some effort into setting up my old LCD nicely and despite its shortcomings, I feel that its picture as I had set it is superior to the Panasonic's *out of the box*.  Out of the box, this set is relatively dim but still harsh and clipping highlights.  Still, some people might see that as \"pop\", a word you often see to describe TV's (positively) these days. I think it's tiring to watch a TV like that for any length of time, though, so it does take some effort to really get this TV to a good state where it's watchable for extended periods.  That's really true of any TV, but I do think some LCD's are close enough to just dim the backlight and be done with it, for most people.Some other thoughts:* The TV is really thin and light for a plasma.  It's much thinner and lighter than my *smaller* LCD TV from a few years ago.* After the 100 hour break-in, the TV does *not* put out a lot of heat, and it does not buzz noticeably. All plasmas put out *some* heat and buzz, but this one puts out less than others I've seen/heard.* Speaking of that, the speakers on this set are pretty good but took some getting used to. They have a lot of dynamic range and can sound \"sparkly\" on the top end. I'm used to TV speakers that are a little muffled sounding, so again, just had to get used to it.* There is an almost imperceptible vertical line of slight discoloration on the right side, about 1\" from the side of the screen. Supposedly the 2011 panels all had this too, so it's not a new thing and doesn't seem to be a defect. I can't really see it on regular content, but some people do. It's not a big deal, but just be aware that you might see it.* The front filter, while apparently better than last year's, still shows a lot of reflections. I've got lamps on either side of my couch and they were so visible on the screen that we've had to move one and turn the other off while watching TV. To be fair, this is now a problem with most LCD's too, which now come with glossy screens on all but low-end sets. But my old matte LCD did not reflect anything.Is this the Holy Grail of TV's? No. There's still not a TV out there that can give you the best of all possible worlds without any of its own unique issues. It is excellent for watching high-def film content, though, once you've taken the time to break it in and set it up right. It's not quite as good for video-based content, and it does take a lot of effort to really get it to its best. Some of that's endemic to plasma technology, but then that's part of the choice you're making when you buy a TV - which technology is right for you. I specifically bought this set because I was unhappy with my LCD for really serious film watching, and I'm happy with this set for that. Strangely enough, though, I still think LCD's are best suited for casual TV watching - they have a slightly sharper picture (not sure why), are not susceptible to image retention, are still brighter, and don't require much effort to set up properly. Someday we'll have a technology (maybe OLED?) that gives us the best of both LCD and plasma without any of the caveats of either.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "SORRY!

I've done a lot of research, along with actually buying LED and Plasmas for my home only to return them because I was unhappy with the picture. This TV beat out all of my expectations with the picture compared to all the other sets I've owned in the past month alone. This being said you need to look up the recommended calibrations for the picture and then tweek it from there based on your liking. The calibration helps things 100%! Not to mention being that it's a plasma the image can be viewed from pretty much any angle and still look AMAZING!The sound is good, this is another thing you're going to want to play with the settings on, however once you have, it's really good sound for a room the size that mine is in (my bedroom.) The set does get warm, however that's to be expected from a plasma, I've had no issue yet with IR (Image Retention) though I update if anything changes. The buzzing is incredibly low and is not audible while the watching the TV. If you have the TV on mute you hear a slight distant noise, but nothing that would distract me at least.My personal negative that I was sad about this set was the appearance, Panasonic has some really amazing TV's with really tragic physical appeal. I must say this set looks much better than some of their others though it still has that bulky frame with the awkward stand and acrylic border. Even with this I was incredibly pleased to find that my stand swivels! According to every other review the stand does not swivel, so I'm not sure if Panasonic updated this or if I'm just lucky but my stand definitely swivels!***EDIT!:***After owning the TV for a little less than a month I was amazed by the picture and I've owned plasmas before however this one was too hot for my liking. My room couldn't take it, I do have a fairly small room so that is probably why it made such a difference though I couldn't handle it. I returned it and purchased the LG Cinema Screen 47LM7600. So far between this TV and the LG their both amazing TV's. The only thing I could say that I miss is the very true color and the fact that I had Pandora on my TV, the LG for some reason does not have Pandora as an app. All in all still a great TV it just made my room very hot.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME", "Author": "hf", "ReviewID": "R205YECENX555C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "AWESOME TV.

By no means do I consider myself a TV expert but before I make large purchases I tend to put in a lot of work with in person viewing and online reviews. It took probably a month before I made my final decision. Its very hard to judge a TV in a store such as Best Buy because all the LED TV exhibit that POP that catches the eye. Once I got this TV on the wall it was like creating my own movie theater.Right out of the box I was using the Cinema mode to watch movies as well as HD cable. The colors appeared to be vibrant and life like. After watching like that for about a week, I checked out a couple of forums and found a person who did a calibration on the same model. I will post his setting at the end of my review. Once I changed it to those settings the picture quality became even better. I haven't tried 3D or any of the internet because I don't really need them. Blu-ray movies are absolutely stunning. At this price point I feel this TV is the Best Bang for the buck.I have this TV in a very large room so I don't hear any of the buzzing that were talked about in other reviews.

Fortunately, you don't have to buy Samsungs glasses which are way overpriced. This TV uses active 3d and according to some sources active 3d gives a \"small\" population of people headaches. Out of three people who watched the 3d so far, one person got a headache while watching. This was kind of disappointing as it essentially cut off a person from watching 3d.3d picture quality - When putting on the 3d glasses the screen gets noticeably darker, which is the case with all 3d glasses/TV's. It actually got so dark that a lot of detail was lost in the movie I was watching. None of the default settings had a good 3d viewing settings on them. The only one that actually let me clearly see the background images was the vivd settings which had the side effect of also making everything look cartoonish. I've yet to play with the custom settings to find a good 3d setting for the TV.Otherwise the 3d offered wonderful depth. This was ruined sometimes when crosstalk was present, something unavoidable with 3d TV's at this stage.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Viera (Panasonic's name for the software providing the internet functions of this TV) - I have this TV setup through my Wifi network.I haven't played to much with the Viera but I noticed that this TV would show small banner ads when increasing the volume or turning on the TV. This feature is on by default but can be disabled by going into setup, advanced setup, and turning off banner ads.Connecting the TV through wifi was easy and I had no problems. I clicked around through the Netflix menu and noticed, as compared to my old roku 1 box, that everything loaded much more quickly. I didn't have to sit and wait for the movie titles to load. One thing that is taking some getting used to is that instead of sliding from one movie title to another, as the Roku does, or one category to another the movie would jump. this would make the whole screen move instantly. For example, the ROKU smoothly scrolls the page down for you, whereas Viera jumps from one page to the next. However, I did not actually watch a movie from or amazon so I can't make anymore comments on the wifi speeds/quality.Viera app (for smartphones, both android OS and Iphones OS)I didn't receive a remote for the TV, since I brought the TV used, and instead am using my smartphone as a remote. This works through the wifi connection so if you're not planning on connecting the TV or are having problems connecting your phone to your wifi connection this won't work.Other than working perfectly as a remote the viera app is loaded with some pretty cool features, letting you easily swipe and share pictures from your remote to your TV, use your smartphone as a gaming controller, as well as a few other things.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Image retention and/or burn in - This is a huge fear with Plasma TV's. This is where a faded image will either be retained for a time period on the screen, even when viewing something else, or burned in forever. I have had no problems so far with this. However, I brought this TV used and there's some debate that the first 100-200 hours is the most fragile period for the TV. Also, I don't really do anything with the TV that puts a lengthy still picture on it. For example, connecting it to my computer and just leaving the background image on, playing games that have HUD's that never move, or watch sports/news channels that have logo's that are always in the same spot and never move. Additionally, I turned the anti-image retention option on (which only works if the screen isn't set to full) and also tweaked the power saver mode for this TV so that it'll turn itself off more frequently, since people in my family like to fall alseep to background noise.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent tv.", "Author": "Richard Alexander", "ReviewID": "R1I49RZMYDX13B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv after having a LED lit DLP tv.

I've been watching regular TV without and \"hard\" static images so far and plan to do so for the next couple weeks. Even when I'm not home I leave it on a movie channel with no logos in the corner of the screen.

Our previous \"big giant box\" TV was only 37 inches.  I was concerned that 50 inches might be too big since we watch from only about 8-10 feet away, but it is not too big at all.  I am astounded at the clarity of the picture with HD.  So much better than our previous non HD one.  Set up was easy even for a 60+ year old female.  The default picture settings need to be tweaked to get the best picture, but it only took me a few minutes to figure out what I liked and set it.  The TV immediately connected to my Wi-Fi with no problem.  A great feature is that you can click the internet button on the remote and immediately have access to Netflix, YouTube, Facebook and internet, although I don't know why you want to check your Facebook on your TV.  To navigate the internet, It's very cumbersome to click through the onscreen alphabet set up when you are searching for something.  I will stick to surfing on my computer or iPad.  YouTube makes it possible to search and choose what you want to watch on your iPad and then it comes up on the TV.  This saves much time in searchting what you want when you don't have to do all that one-letter-at-a-time alphabet clicking onscreen.

The audio out requires an optical cord which will not work with my husband's TV Ears.  If you have a speaker or other audio device with RCA connectors, you will have to buy an optical to RCA adapter.  I have not done that yet but in searching a little bit, they don't seem to be outrageously expensive.  Our workaround for now is to connect the TV Ears RCA plugs into the DirectTV cable box, but this doesn't do any good when we watch something on Netflix or YouTube because it is coming through the internet connection and not the cable box.  Other than the audio out issue, we think it is a great TV so far with a WOW picture quality.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!!", "Author": "Roy S.

I own a TC-P55GT30.  It recently stopped working with the 7 blinks of death.  I did some research online and talked to a tv service rep and it seemed likely the problem was a bad SC board.  After trying over and over to get Panasonic to offer to fix it without me having to pay $150 just for the diagnosis, I just decided to fix it myself.  All in, it cost me $109 to fix the TV.  When done I called panasonic to try and get a reimbursed for the part.  Since I did not have a technician do it, they refuse to help.  So even though the board is defective and I saved them $375 (the total repair cost by my local technician is $475) they still will not help due to me breaking process.  When asked why saving them $375 is a bad thing, they cannot offer a reason.I just wanted to take a minute to tell people that I would personally never buy a Panasonic again.

Potts", "ReviewID": "R2VR98MYIOOTG1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This review is based on a single issue I want to draw attention to. Despite the one star, I don't really hate my new Panasonic Viera plasma TV. I love the beautiful picture, and I need not have worried about the plasma display holding up in my sometimes sunlit living room -- it does just fine.My issue is with the Viera Connect controls for streaming videos from services such as Amazon Instant Videos. I mean controls for such things as fast forward, rewind, frame stepping, and the like. The problem is that these controls, where they exist at all, are useless. The remote control has the usual play, pause, forward, and rewind buttons. But if you press the rewind button for even a second or two, you find the movie has jumped back ten or fifteen minutes! Then you look at a black screen for 30-40 seconds while it rebuffers. Then you press the forward button, trying to hold it down for as short a time as you can in order not to advance too far to get back to where you wanted to go in the movie. Then wait another 30-40 seconds while it rebuffers again, to see where you landed. If you get to within 3-4 minutes of the spot you wanted, you have to be content with that. The experience is so horrible, you soon learn not to bother trying to scroll back to something you missed or might want to see again, unless you really really REALLY want to see it.As a result, I got my Roku back out of storage and set it back up for video streaming. The Roku performs these functions very well, which shows that it can be done. It's simply a matter of the designers caring enough. I'm disappointed. I had assumed that my new TV would be good for streaming and I could eliminate a device.This may seem like a minor issue, but I can't help thinking: For this I paid $1100?", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "either a bad tv, or no quality control", "Author": "Randolph Scott \"Randy\"", "ReviewID": "R3RWQW5ZUBWW6M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just need to start by saying, I'm a huge fan of Panasonic TV's. My wife also. I have only bought Panasonic tv's in the past 25 years, and my wife and her family also. My wife even spent $2500 5 years ago for a top of the line 42\u00a8. So when it came to buy a new tv for the living room, the choice was easy, and my wife being a tv junky wanted a high-end set. So we decided on the ST50.The first tv we ordered was the 55st50 from best buy. I hooked it up with an hdmi cable to my u-verse cable (the problems were the same with blue-ray) and gave it a whirl. What's wrong I thought? The colors were'nt that deep, and people's faces have a pale tint to them as if they are going to die tomorrow. I tried adjusting the colors, the tint, and all. No luck. I had a choice between either the sickly color, or overly red faces, that still somehow managed to look pale (I know, it sounds like a contradiction). I even tried D-nices colors to no avail. Even the Disney WOW blue-ray dvd did'nt help.Honey hand me my glasses so I can watch tv. Oops, I don't wear glasses. What i'm trying to say here is that the tv lacked focus, usually. What does that mean? It means that I would be watching tv, and the picture would be so soft, that it was like removing your glasses. It was like a projector that out of focus.  Then the scene would change, or they would change to a different camera in the same shot, and it would be nice and sharp. Now I know people will say \u00a8the tv is so good, that it shows differences in camera quality\u00a8, I assure you it's not that. I actually had to get used to only listening to the tv, with only occasionly glancing up at it. It would be so soft, that I would get a headache trying to focus my eyes on something that was out of focus.Honey can you please turn off the disco strobe light. Oh, its the tv.I would be watching the tv, and any time there was a scene with a bright area to it, the screen would strobe. So if I was watching a scen where the actor was standing next to a white building outside, the white area would strobe. I shut off the ABL to no effect. I made sure the ecco mode was turned off. I made sure, that eveything was correct in the settings, to no effect. I can honestly say without exageration, that this set could possibly siezure inducing in people succeptable.Media player, we don't need no stinkin media player (or at least panasonic thinks so)I have probably over 200 movies and tv shows in .avi and h.254 format. These videos play on every player I have tried from high-end dvd players to $20 wal-mart boxes with no problem. On this set half of the files won't receive a error message saying they are'nt readable. I checked, and these same files work on everything else.New TV, or better said replacement.Hey what about the good reviews?I figured it must just be a defective tv, so I returned the tv to best buy and ordered the 50st50 from amazon.  The tv showed up. I set it up with D-nices slides for 100 hours, I used the D-nice's settings. I even tried the Disney WOW blue-ray, and still bad. The new 50st50 does'nt strobe as bad, but it still strobes on bright areas.Who closed the screen door?With any camera panning on brighter or bright areas, it looks like someone is walking by the tv with a screen door in hand. What the heck!!!  You have got to be kidding me.Media player, we really, really don't need no stinkin media player.On the new tv the media player won't play a single video file. Not one! It says every file is unreadable. I had the files on a usb thumb drive, so i tried walking in to sears, and they played on every tv but the panasonics. Not good panasonic.Summing upThe other problems also still existed on this set also. The image going in-and-out of focus. The people that were so pale they looked like they were going to die. So lets see, my parents 10 year old Samsung 50 inch looks fine, and I can watch it for 12 hours straight (I know, i'm pathetic), but neither of these panasonics could be watched for more than 30 seconds.Even though I hate to do, but i'm going to buy a Samsung. I really wanted to buy a panasonic, but after two different tvs from two different vendors were un-watchable, I have given up faith in panasonic.I guess it's time to say goodbye to a brand of tv that has been part of my family for over 30 years.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "World's worst customer service", "Author": "ZB132", "ReviewID": "R2I6DZJW9UJ4QN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yes it's a great TV but the relationship between the TV and the active 3D glasses can be tricky and if you try to get Panasonic customer service on the phone you should be prepared to waste a day and a half.

For both deliveries, one driver showed up, didn't unbox the TV's, didn't set them up, or remove and carry away the packaging as promised when purchased. In each instance, Amazon refunded me $45 and said they'd send feedback to the carrier (CEVA). I've read some reviews where customers say they've gotten inside delivery and set up, so it's apparently no myth. But I've yet to receive the promised inside delivery and set up from Amazon or ANY dealer I've purchased from. This plasma has damage near top center bezel which likely attributed to the panel defect. Had the driver delivered the service as promised, this damage and the panel defect would have been noticed while the driver was here.-- UPDATE --My replacement ST50 had horizontal banding on the far right of the panel. The AVS forum has a poll showing that over 40% of buyers experienced the same problem, and that's not the only problem in the poll that was experienced. If you're still considering buying the ST50 there's something else you should know. CNET testers accidentally left a static image on this TV and the Samsung e6500 for a weekend, then another static image mishap occurred that added to the horror.

The Samsung e6500 had no retention at all - and that's for a weekend+ of a frozen DVD menu!I did my own test for image retention on the ST50, and it's as bad as they say.There are doubtless people who sit five or more feet from their TV, and therefore might never see a row of gray banding or the retained logo from the History Channel.  But chances are if you fall asleep with a Blu Ray on, you're going to be seeing it's menu for a while.The CNET review is just as great for the Samsung as it is for the Panasonic.The Samsung e6500 is $150 more, and it's nearly identical to the ST50 in terms of black levels and smart features - plus the TV includes 2 pair of 3D glasses.That's something else you don't get with the ST50.I ordered the Samsung e6500 and the Panasonic ST50 is on it's way back.Amazon deserves 5 stars for how fantastic they've been so far in making it all right.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "IMAGE RETENTION/HEATS", "Author": "JUNIOR", "ReviewID": "R1AA0FS3AQ0R8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Panasonic VIERA TC-P50ST50 50-Inch 1080p 600Hz Full HD 3D Plasma TV overheats and it makes my room around 10-15 degrees fahrenheit warmer.

Here are my updated impressions:-- Picture quality:  Pretty incredible.  I could not ask for anything more.  If you are a \"normal\" viewer, I don't think there is any point in paying more than this.  The VT50 might be better in a side-by-side comparison...but who cares.  I just do not think it's worth paying 50% more for maybe a marginally better picture.-- Bright-room performance:  It does a fine job.  As good as an LCD, I think.  Of course it looks better with the lights off, but so would any screen.-- Buzzing:  Yes, it buzzes when the screen is bright.  But you can only hear it in silence.  Also, most normal TV/movie scenes are fairly dark, so it doesn't even buzz audibly 90% of the time.  This is not something to worry about.-- Image retention:  This TV definitely shows IR.  There is no question.  I have noticed that it is MUCH more susceptible to IR in the first moments after it is turned on.  So if you must display a static image, make sure that the TV has already warmed up for at least 10-15 minutes.  Last night I watched a full baseball game and there was some light IR from the score box, even though I had the contrast turned down to 55.  I ran slides overnight and it vanished.  On the other hand, I also watched a 2 hour letterboxed movie with contrast at 95, and did not see any IR whatsoever from the black bars.  So that's pretty good.Basically, just be careful.  Static images will leave IR on this screen.  Hopefully it will happen less with age, but I can't say right now.  Chances are it won't be very noticeable, and it will go away after a while.  But if it bothers you, you can always run slides or static or something for 8 hours and it'll probably go away.I wish it wasn't this way, but I guess it's just the nature of the technology.  What you get in return is a truly stunning picture.I would no longer call the IR a dealbreaker, but it definitely drops this TV from five stars to four.  Just be wary of it and you'll be fine.-------------------------------------EDIT 3:  I ordered a replacement ST50, it arrived last week but it had a dead pixel right in the middle of the screen so I refused delivery.  I ordered a second replacement which arrived today and appears to be free of defects.  On the bright side, the price dropped by $90 during this time, which Amazon was nice enough to refund.I am running break-in slides for the next 4+ days.  I'll return here to update my review when the break-in process is complete and I have had some time to use the TV.--------------------------------------EDIT 2:  The ST50 is on its way back to Amazon.  I would like to clarify a few things:-- I have only had one TV so far.  It's possible that it was defective.  I have no way of being sure.-- The IR was caused by this image:  [...]  It is displayed during commercial breaks for baseball games, and is therefore only on screen for two or three minutes at a time.  The background moves; only the text and logo are static.  I was able to clear the IR from the \"commercial break in progress...\" text, but not from the logo.-- Last night I decided to test the TV a little because I knew it was going back.  Note that at this point, the TV had about 80-90 hours on it.  I set the picture to cinema mode with contrast 80, brightness 40, color 50.  I then watched a baseball game.  After only a few commercial breaks, the IR from the \"commercial break in progress...\" text had returned in full force.  Please understand this is probably only 10-15 minutes of total display time, and even then broken up into few minute chunks.-- CNET accidentally tested three TVs for IR resistance a few days ago.  You can find that blog post here [...]  Here is the short version:  They left a static screen on three TVs for approximately 8 hours.  The Panasonic VT50 showed IR that eventually faded, the GT50 showed IR that did not fade, and the Samsung E6500 showed no IR at all.  Thanks to T. Brooks for pointing this out.-- There is a discussion I started over on AVS Forums about this: [...]-- Again, my set may have been defective.  I'm not sure.  I am not attempting to make any broad generalizations like \"all Panasonic products are terrible\" or \"never buy a plasma TV.\"  However, the evidence suggests that the current Samsung plasmas are more resistant to IR then the current Panasonics.----------------------------EDIT:  Two days later.  I have been running the TV nonstop for the past 48 hours or so.  I actually have gotten most of the IR to fade away, but not all.  I am still returning this set to Amazon, and will probably replace it with another ST50.  I hope that this one is just defective.  When I get the new TV, I plan to run the break-in slides for the first 100 hours (approx. four days) nonstop.  After I evaluate it, I will come back here to update.  If there is no IR, then this TV will get five stars.My advice to prospective buyers:  Know what you are getting into!  Plasmas offer by far the best picture quality for the price, but they require some extra care.  I highly recommend using break-in slides when you first get the TV.  Yes, that means your brand new TV sits in your living room with solid colors on it for four days.  It will be worth it in the long run.  If you must watch something during the break-in period, make sure it is 16:9 content with nothing static.  Avatar is a great movie to test on a new TV, and is conveniently 16:9 (but Avatar is mostly green and blue, so maybe display some red for a while afterwards to compensate).  Some animated films (e.g. Pixar) are also 16:9.  But unfortunately most are 2.35:1.-----------------------------I almost feel bad giving this TV a one-star review, but I honestly feel it deserves it.  If it were not for one critical flaw, it would have gotten five stars.Picture quality:  Breathtaking.  It's better than a movie theater.  I literally got chills the first time I watched it.  Blacks disappear into the background.  The picture gets a little bit washed out with the lights on, but it's no worse than an LCD.Software / \"smart\" features:  Adequate.  The interface is a little slow but it doesn't really matter.  Everything works as it should.Sound:  Didn't use it much, but it seemed fine.  Honestly though, with a TV like this, you need a home audio system to match it.Power consumption:  Varies wildly depending on what's on screen (I actually have a power meter to measure this).  It ranges from about 300 W with a completely white screen to only about 20 W when all black.Settings:  Plenty of options.  You can do whatever you want to the picture.THE DEALBREAKER:  This TV exhibits SEVERE IMAGE RETENTION / BURN-IN (sorry for the caps but I want people to see this).  Yes, I said burn-in.  It is absolutely permanent.  You're probably thinking that I was just negligent and I abused the TV.  No, I did not.  I was very careful to treat this thing well.Let me explain exactly how this happened.  I watch a fair amount of baseball.  If you have ever streamed mlb.tv, you know that it does not show normal commercials, it just shows a screen with the mlb logo.  It is a white logo on a dark blue background.  However, it is only ever displayed for two or three minutes at a time, because baseball commercials are short.  But after watching a couple games, I noticed image retention (IR) of the mlb logo.So I tried to fix it.  IR is supposed to be temporary, right?  I played loops of bright monochromatic color slides to help wear all tho phosphors evenly.  I did this for about 50 hours.  I played random video noise.  I used the built-in \"scrolling bar\" feature.  I even displayed the inverse image of the IR.  All of this did mitigate the IR somewhat, but it is STILL THERE.Yes, the mlb logo is permanently burned into my screen.  It's actually very easy to see.  Imagine watching a movie and seeing a giant \"MLB\" shadowed over someone's face.  Not fun.I should also mention that this is not the only IR, it's just the worst.  Practically any static image left on the screen for more than 5 minutes leaves IR.  Sometimes it goes away, sometimes it doesn't.  There are various other permanent marks on my screen (easily visible with on a pure white background), although none are as offensive as the MLB logo.So, if you think you can watch this TV without ever displaying any static image, you're golden.  That means no TV logos, no tickers at the top or bottom, no sports (because of the static score boxes), no letterboxed movies, no fullscreen content...actually, that's pretty much everything you could possibly watch.  The only safe content is a 16:9 movie with no logo.This is why I give this TV one star.  You cannot watch any normal content without leaving permanent marks all over the screen.  To me, that is a complete dealbreaker.  It's really too bad, because everything else about this TV is exemplary.You may have heard that plasma IR is a thing of the past.  No, it is not, at least not for a 2012 Panasonic ST50.  Evidently, the 2012 Samsungs are not nearly as susceptible to IR, so I will be returning this TV in favor of the similarly priced and specced Samsung PN51E6500.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dead Pixel", "Author": "Indy", "ReviewID": "RFULAR8LJGHFE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Tv features were fine but there was dead pixel in the screen so I had to return the TV", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW", "Author": "jammin", "ReviewID": "R2GEK3P8P5NC0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't believe how good this TV  is especially for the price.

Good contrast when you crank it up but you do have to be careful, the the 600hz obviously isn't \"true\" 600hz so it isn't that helpful in fast paced video games (it reduces blur but you are still bascily blind) but it helps a good deal in some movies. Compared to an LCD it's a tad better but it is not something you would notice once you got into a game/move/show etc. As expected it's 2d to 3d conversion is sub-par. Overall I would have given it a 4 star for vs how much it costs however it has two major downsides1.) No VGA/DVI-D inputs for god only knows why, you think for a TV costing almost a $1000.00 it would have these. So if you want to use it as monitor for 3d games make sure you have HDMI 1.4a or greater output on your video card or track down an illusive dvi-d to HDMI v 1.4a converter.2.) And for reasons I can not begin to fathom it has no headphone out slot so if you have this TV in a bedroom like I do and someone is sleeping you are SOL.These are basic features I would expect to find on any TV made after 2004 (well maybe not d-dvi but VGA at least), even the cheap ones. That being said I would give it only a 2 star on it's value as those problems can not be fixed without making new circuit boards and installing it yourself; but still a 3 star overall. It does have good picture and some of the latest 3d technology so you can buy cheap Samsung active 3d glasses for a mere $20.00. Last it's audio is pretty good, It doesn't beat mediocre headphone/sound system but for a T.V. it's pretty good.Also this T.V. is prone to IR and light burn in. After a mere 4 hours of gameplay at 80 contrast I had IR that took over 60 hours of running solid colors and the build in screen wipe to remove. Overall I would have to say if you are a movie lover or just watch basic TV. It's a great T.V. with great picture you can't find in LED-LCDs and many even many other plasmas,and it has more features then you would ever need and almost no risk of burn in. If you use your T.V. for gaming I would look elsewhere as it's lack of inputs and ease of IR (which I can only assume is the case with all plasmas since this is a \"next gen\" model with advanced anti-IR)make it one of worst choices you can make.UPDATE: About twenty days in a \"green snow\" effect appeared and the T.V. shut off. About a week later it stopped working all togeather.

I had to run out and get one and it is aftermarket so it doesn't lock into the TV like the stock one would (not a huge deal about being aftermarket but they said everything was included and I think the power cord is pretty essential).

I usually don't rate anything but I figured with the amount of time that went into this decision (more than any other single decision through the entire process of a new home purchase, no joke) it could be beneficial to countless other TV shoppers for me to share my experience.Foreward:I just moved into a brand new and my first home.  My fiance and I had all of the major expenses budgeted for and I was going to go big on a ballin' TV to be the focal point of the family room. My budget was around $2,500.  If I found the perfect fit for $3k, so be it, I'd throw down.  Basically money was not a deciding factor.  The family room is large with high ceilings.  I was targeting 55-60 inches.  I sit approximately 8 feet from the screen so I felt this would be the best fit and be the size that would offer the largest selection. There are three big windows in the room which face the south so I knew the glare would be an issue.All i have owned to this point is LCD/LED.  When I first started my search, Plasma wasn't even an option.  As far as I knew, burn-in was still a nagging issue and I just always preferred the brightness of an LED.  I was already 90% certain I'd be purchasing the Sammy D8000.  The aesthetics are just so superior.  Upon reading countless reviews complaining of flashlighting (which has never seemed to bug me as bad as the rest of the population) and terrible screen uniformity, combined with the premium you pay for Sammys, I decided to keep looking.  Long story short, after countless hours of review reading/watching/listening and several visits to BB, I had become a turncoat.  I was going to purchase my first Plasma television.  I went to avforums more than twice so it was obviously going to be a Panasonic (lol) and since the 30 series looks like the illegitimate child of a Zenith bubble screen and the original Game Boy i was going with the ST50.About Me:Seven time fantasy football champion, multi-sport athlete (in men's league) and P90x graduate.  What does this have to do with TV watching?  Well, absolutely nothing but any chance I get to toot my own horn I'm going to take. But in all seriousness, super picky, anal to a fault yet very diligent purchaser, especially when it comes to electronics.  I like to watch a ton of sports, primarily football and hockey, play PS3 (my flagship game is NHL), watch Blu-Rays, Netflix and DirecTV (Game of thrones, Dexter, NatGeo, South Park, Always Sunny).The Review:The Good:The delivery was awesome, as expected with Amazon and Home Direct.  Aesthetically, the set looks fantastic.  No complaints whatsoever.  The bright room performance is very good.  Does a great job of deflecting all glare.  Additionally, the picture setting variety and customizable interface was attractive to me.  The \"smart\" feature and apps were nice additions but truth be told; I don't really give two craps about any of the extras.  I wanted picture quality, pop, exuberance, ohhhs and ahhs and unfortunately this set has none of it.The Bad:It ships in standard mode, probably to comply with some sort of energy requirements.  For those of you who have not seen standard mode on the ST50, let me paint the picture; Panasonic trains a family of orangoutangs to fling poo at the screen for 2 hours, they then box it up and ship it off. Literally no color or excitement whatsoever.  All the reviews said that the \"out-of-the-box\" settings of cinema mode were very good. They weren't.  They still lacked that \"pop\" I was looking for.  I decided to stick by my decision and prepare for the 100 hour break in calibration laid out by D Nice.  Also, let me give him a quick plug, there was a SIGNIFICANT improvement after performing this calibration.  When calibration completed, however, I expected no miracle.  I did not get one. It still lacked life, brightness and that wow factor.My biggest beef is the ABL.  Good grief, if ANYONE watches hockey, this is not for you.  Period.  Stay away.  It's not so much the kicking in of the ABL as it is the lackluster picture when ABL is running.  Let me give you an example; puck goes in corner, camera zooms in, screen looks ok.  Puck comes out of corner, zoom out, wow, where's the color? Is that sheet of ice gray? I hope the ice isn't melting.  Are they skating on cement?  I kid you not, it is that bad.  I have had at least 10 sets of eyes on this screen and there isn't much of an argument. I noticed this plaguing basketball as well, so basketball fanatics also take note.Sports were disappointing so I decided to go to Game of Thrones of the DVR.  I went with a repeat because I didn't want the distraction from a brand new episode while trying to convince myself this was better then watching it on my 5 year old Sharp Aquos. The picture still looked lifeless.  Yeah, the blacks were dark but so were the whites, tans, reds and greens.I have adjusted D Nice's settings a bit to make it brighter and it just isn't working.  There's just no excitement there, bottom line.  I have tried a variety of other programming with the same results.  The picture just doesn't do it for me.I feel like I should also mention that I did indeed notice the Plasma buzz.  Quite a bit of it actually.  Sitting 8 feet away with the volume at a comfortable level.  Is it a deal breaker? No.  Would I return it if I loved the picture? Absolutely not. But it is there and definitely not ideal.Isn't A 1 Star rating A Bit Harsh?:Absolutely not.  This is a huge purchase, especially for a luxury item.  The fact that I picked this set to be \"the one\" and it is now going back, doesn't warrant a single star, in my opinion.Conclusion:I have decided to return the television.  Home Direct will be coming later this week.  Amazon was fantastic with the process (as always).  In a day where a single human being has to deal with the customer service of Comcast, DirecTV and AT&T;, it is so refreshing to receive true customer service. I will probably begin my next search with the new Sharp 847u, maybe look at some LGs and Sonys as well.  If anyone has some advice, I'm all ears.

Had i known the bezel would look the way it did on this set i probably would have initially opted for the GT or a different Plasma all together.-Noticeable GlareWhile not as bad as the first gen Plasmas it is still very noticeable. My living room has blinds that are drawn andthis morning i could see them reflected on the screen. The TV is placed by the fireplace directly in front and the blinds are on the left wall.I realize that with a plasma you will never get zero glare like with a matte LCD screen but the specs boasted to a filter that would virtually eliminate them, this is not the case.All and all this might be a great TV for some or those who aren't looking for anything amazing. But i already have a set like that and was looking to jump up into something that would WOW me and this did not and has not.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Full HD 3D\nInfinite Black Pro Panel\nVIERA Connect Wi-Fi Built-In (with Web Browser)\n3D Real Sound\nTV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 46.5-Inch x 28-Inch x 1.8-Inch, TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 46.5-Inch x 29.8-Inch x 13.2-Inch", "Name": "Panasonic VIERA TC-P50ST50 50-Inch 1080p 600Hz Full HD 3D Plasma TV (2012 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sKPR7%2BgEL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00752VKW8"}}
