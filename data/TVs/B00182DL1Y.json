{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good, basic set with great HD performance", "Author": "Dave R", "ReviewID": "R13HPLA5F7AXRA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to admit I bought this set on an impulse, without a lot of research. I needed a new TV, I'd heard and read some positive reviews about Vizio (in general, not this set in particular), it looked great in the store (don't they all) and the price was right. So without any experience with or knowledge of HD televisions I took the plunge.Set up couldn't have been easier, although the down-facing inputs are a little difficult to access. The manual and back panel are well diagramed and it was simple figuring out what goes where. I had the cable box and DVD player hooked up immediately and was watching standard def TV within 5 minutes of getting it out of the box. I got an HDMI cable the next day from my cable company for $9 (DON'T OVERPAY for an HDMI cable!) and was accessing the Hi-Def channels after that one simple connection.The 32\" size is perfect for my small (15 x 15) living room. I was immediately impressed by the picture, but the factory settings for brightness and color were way too high for my taste. After getting slightly frustrated with the many picture adjustment settings and choices and having trouble getting a consistently good picture from channel to channel, I found a review online on cnet of the similar VX32L which listed the exact settings they used for the review...I transferred those settings to my set then slightly tweaked them to my liking and the picture is now pretty close to perfect.Like I said, I have no experience with HD so I can't say if this set has a better picture than its competitors, but standard-def stations are actually better than I expected they would be and most hi-def content is absolutely amazing. If you're getting this set to watch sports that are shot and broadcast in HD you will not be disappointed. I can't imaging the picture being any better - it far exceeds my expectations. That being said, if you expect all channels to look like the HD demos they display in the stores, you're in for a let down (nothing to do with the Vizio, but the majority of programing out there is still standard def). It takes a little getting used to the bars on the side or the stretched image (depending on what mode you choose to watch standard TV on), but the Vizio makes it easy to access the menus and experiment with those different viewing modes. Some of the other hi-def content has been a mixed bag. Most of the sitcoms on TBSHD don't look that much better than the standard-def versions. The movies on HBOHD are considerably better than the standard broadcasts, but none have blown me away with crisp detail and vivid color like the sports and concert content have.The Vizios remote is very basic. Adjust volume, change channels, choose input source, and bring up the menus. That's it. Unless you have another universal remote that can handle all the Vizio's options you're going to need at least one other remote to fully operate your system.  Another minor complaint is that the viewing angle is not as good as advertised. I found that viewing off center by as little as 25 or 30 degrees dulls the picture considerably. No big deal for me, but something you  might want to investigate if it's important to you. On the plus side, room lighting had very little affect on the quality of the picture - it looks just as good in the day with the blinds open as it does when the room is completely darkened. A nice surprise.The built-in sound is adequate. Typical simulated surround sound option and a basic equalizer. Clear dialog and good enough to live with until I get a real surround system, but nothing to write home about.DVDs look just fine, but it's hard to get excited over the quality after experiencing the HDTV. Just keep in mind that DVDs that aren't already 16 x 9 will still have to be viewed with bars (top and bottom, or side to side depending on the original aspect ratio) or be stretched (i.e. distorted) in order to fill the screen.  Know this going in, as this is the top complaint I'm hearing in talking to other new wide screen owners.Overall all I'm very happy with my purchase. I think I had realistic expectations of what standard def programming would look like on an HDTV and I'm satisfied (though not thrilled) with the Vizios performance. I am thrilled, however, with the Vizios HD performance - It is amazing, and I would recommend this set to anyone looking for an affordable entry point into HDTV.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Incredible Quality", "Author": "TRFB", "ReviewID": "R27SSKINQ6FHDF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our first LCD HDTV and I am extremely happy with it.  The picture quality is gorgeous and the price is very inexpensive.  I dare say that the quality is matched with Sony and Samsung!!  That's just my opinion.I love that there are all these inputs, 3 HDMI, Composite, S-Video, Component and RGB.I first hooked it up to my PC and immediately it was so nice.  My goodness.  I highly recommend this TV and other VIZIO's.  Don't do what I've done for many, many years and stay with the higher more expensive brands.  Dare to compare this one with the leading brands.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome Value", "Author": "Joseph Lesane", "ReviewID": "R2T4EXCZAB0PGG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want to get Hd television for little money, VIZIO is amazing/  The built-in hd tuner is awesome!  The picture quality is outstanding & it weighs nothing!  The only downfall to this LCD is that there are no audio outputs, so could be frustrating.  If you are like me though & have a cable or sattelite receiver you can just run your audio straight from the box to your receiver w/ minimal problems.  Amazing quality for the price/  worth a try!", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "BEWARE of this TV", "Author": "avid reader \"mccate\"", "ReviewID": "R1SU7TFZTYF63A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I should have listened to the reviews; price is reasonable, picture and sound good but after not quite six months the main signal board needs to be replaced for a fee almost as much as the TV cost.  We found the remote was not working; bought a new remote which did not work either.  The place that sold us the remote said bring it in and we will see what's wrong.  We did and now the warranty is VOID because we took it there.  Will never purchase a Visio again! Customer service is non existent.

I am not sure why but despite the 720p label I am able to get 1080p. I have done so on my upconvert pioneer dvd player and my xbox 360 (component cables) with out a problem. I know people with sony and sharp 32\" hdtvs and the vizio looks about the same as far as picture goes (maybe not always as high of black levels on the vizio). Although I usually don't notice black levels as a problem, certain scenes in certain dvds don't look right for whatever reason (maybe 10% of dvds). This is probably not the best option out their, but it is the best bargain I could find and I am happy with my purchase. I just want to know why I get 1080p when the manual says 720p, is this normal for this tv? I kind of wish I would have gotten a bigger tv now, because the prices have dropped recently, so be sure that 32\" is big enough for you. Also this tv is now kind of out dated being that it is 60htz refresh rate with the 3:2 pull down, opposed to 120 or 240htz (look up the difference It would take a while for me to explain).Pros:Bright image, Easy to use controls/menus, Good selection of inputs, Lifelike color, Looks great, Overall picture qualityCons:Black levels, No hdmi out, Out datedTV Connected To:Antenna, DVD player, External sound system, Satellite, Xbox 360Describe Yourself:Critical, technically savvy viewer, Movie buff, Sports fanHow long have you owned it:More than six monthsBottom Line:Yes, I would recommend this to a friend", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "For a reasonable price you get a nice TV", "Author": "Mbna America \"itsmejs\"", "ReviewID": "R2CZLIQP8HC7PQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We saved hundreds of dollars buying a Vizo instead of higher priced brands with no regrets.

Although it looks good, it is crap. If you never heard of the company before, there is a reason why. I purchased this TV from Walmart exactyly 12 months ago, and the TV does not even work anymore. It does not power on and because I no longer had my receipt after a year I was stuck with a TV that I just threw in with the garbage. The company act like they could not do anything about it. I had paid 550.00 for the TV and this sucks. I would never buy another TV from a company that is new. Stick with the older companys such as sony.,Toshiba, Sanyo, GE and more established.
