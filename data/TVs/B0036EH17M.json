In bright conditions the picture is great and I really don't feel as though this running at 60Hz degrades the quality at all so don't worry about that.The bad..Flashlighting - in a dark environment like watching a movie in the dark this set exhibits horrible flashlighting - the light from the leds in the edges leaks onto the screen washing out the picture. Deal breaker so I returned it and got the 6800 which can dim these leds enhancing contrast and eliminating the flashlighting.Also of note is that the controls on the TV are impossible to make out because they are black/grey on the black bezel.So if you can find one that doesn't leak light or only watch  with the lights on it will work for you, if you want to watch in the dark you should go a different route.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Looks great even when its off!", "Author": "DE", "ReviewID": "R1XR8H0AY7ZE1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this lovely thang yesterday.  I have not played with it that much, but I have done enough to provide a decent review.  My main concern with this purchase was that it is 60 Hz.  Now that there is 120 and 240, I was not sure if getting 60 was smart.  I read a review some where that pointed out that most PC monitors are 60 Hz.  My 25 inch monitor is 60 Hz and the picture looks beautiful when I'm playing games or watching movies so I said wth.  Last night I watched a NBA game and put on a few movies with intense action scenes... no image blur whatsoever.  I love the look of this television and the fact that it is super thin.  The controls on the tv itself are touch controls.  There are no actual buttons to press.  As far as HD goes...the picture, color, and clarity are unbelievable.  The picture is so detailed that some of your favorite stars don't look so hot once you see them in HD.  I will be purchasing some sort of sound system for this tv.  My PC has a Logitech 2.1 speaker system and I have become spoiled.  The sound from this tv is decent but falls way short of what I like.  The only real complaint I have about this tv is that the allshare feature which allows you to stream music and video from your PC requires a Samsung USB wireless link which is a little over $70 (unless you hardwire it).  I'm sure a regular wireless USB adapter could have done the trick but Samsung forces you to use theirs (which they fail to mention).  I really feel that wireless should have been built into the tv in the first place but enough with that rant! Finally, I have to give it to Amazon.  Their price was the best anywhere...that's not including the fact that there was no shipping charge.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "this tv rocks.  cheaper elsewhere", "Author": "J. Crawford", "ReviewID": "RA0PS87BLT51E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I helped someone shop for a new HDTV who was upgrading from a 10 year old 27\" CRT. They wanted the newest technology and something that would last them at least another 10 years.  I picked up this model at a big box B&M; store for $900.  Everyone is pretty impressed with the performance of the set.  Picture quality is stunning.  Size is quite large... the TV itself also looks elegant.  Here are a couple of pros and cons...pros:-super high contrast, incredible brightness compared to other LED TVs-super sharp, crisp picture.  Miles above the competition in my opinion.-1.2\" thick!  Think about that... it is unreal!-anynet detects source inputs and changes them automatically, and you can control them with the tv remote.  no need to put in codes or anything... tv remote controls the sony blu ray player I picked up.-very customizeable picture settings-audio output- both 3.5mm and toslink (although rca output is missing unfortunately)-4 HDMI inputs for all your 1080p toyscons:-couldn't tell in the store but the screen is very glossy and picks up a lot of window reflections and lighting glare.  Be careful about where this tv is going to be placed.  Really wish it was a matte finish-Ony one component and one composite input, and they overlap.  So you cannot run a component AND a composite input at the same time... this was very misleading and it took me a while to figure out there was a composite input at all!-Hard to tell what the actual contrast ratio is, I wish that tv companies were required to give a consistent contrast ratio rating without factoring in all the \"dynamic contrast\" b.s.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value and Picture", "Author": "John D. Wise", "ReviewID": "R1Q1URDV57CYNT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this TV after a great deal of research and many visits to local stores to compare HDTVs.  The picture from this unit stood out as best-in-store at two of the stores we visited.  We spent a lot of time being concerned about going with a 60hz unit due to the fact that all stores sales people were pushing the 120hz. or even 240hz.  For our typical use, we finally decided that we would be absolutely waisting money on the quicker refresh cycles.  Now that we have the TV and can compare it to our Sony XBR4 we are very pleased that we saved the money.  The picture is great and high-speed motion such as in football does not appear much different between our two sets.  The TV also has a cinema setting for the issue of a 24 frame per second film, if anyone is worried.  The quality of this HDTV is very obvious out of the box, particularly when one sees the thick glass stand that comes with it.  The limited amount of assembly required is very simple, but you will need two people to assemble the TV to the base.  The setup was very simple and if you don't know the answer to questions like what type of channels you have coming from your program source, the TV will detect what ever is available and automatically delete any channels that are encoded and thus not actually viewable without a cable box (for example).  i would rate the sound from the TV built-in speakers as acceptable for normal TV watching but certainly not great if you want dynamic theater type sound.  Obviously you can connect to a receiver or a sound bar if you will want that type of sound.  This is a fantastic HDTV!Amazon was the best place to purchase this TV from a price standpoint and their delivery was as scheduled and excellent.  I was very pleased with the delivery and the clearly unopened box was flawless.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung Quality / Support Doubtful", "Author": "WhoLetTheDogsOut", "ReviewID": "R2IA6J8NYB29TI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The picture quality is not what you expect from an LED TV and the sound quality is okayish at the start but goes bad with time. Secondly, the customer support from Samsung is grossly inadequate.

We originally went to purchase a 47\" Vizio, but after comparing pictures side by side, we were amazed at the detail on this set.  The demo video playing had HD nature scenes, and while most sets had a nice picture, this tv looked as if you were looking out a window at the landscapes, while the others looked \"flat\". It hooked up quickly at home, and the remote control worked with our Sony BluRay player out of the box, with no programming required.  Movies (.avi & .mp4) played from thumb drive easily, which was an improvement on playing them on the bluray player, as .avi files were not a supported type.  Sound was great, I'm not sure why others complained, there are several modes to choose from, and even on movie mode the music from internet radio sounded wonderful.  Maybe if you're used to an external surround sound system this tv's sound falls short, but compared to our older Sanyo LCD tv, this sound is much better - I'm glad we didn't spend our money on an external sound system.The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the fact that Samsung requires that you use their LANstick for wireless connection, which is quite expensive compared to other USB wireless sticks.  However, I would still recommend this tv to anyone looking for a GREAT picture and sound.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Television", "Author": "Teejayess \"Assyranok\"", "ReviewID": "R2KZR5N3IFSAW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This television is gorgeous. It is the perfect size to enjoy from short or long distance. What I admire most about this television is the ease of instillation and changing settings. I watched Finding Nemo with my family after setting this television up and I specifically remember us drooling. Even the dogs were drooling, although they do that anyway.I like to do a form review for items like this. Each rating is out of ten - 10 being the best.Quality: 10The display and feed is top quality. Until recently, I expected to only see television this crisp in a 2,000 dollar tv. THe fact that it is an LED LCD makes the picture quality more versatile and the options more flexible.Menus and Settings: 10The menus are incredibly easy to navigate and master. I consider myself very intelligent, but challenged. I am easily confused by convoluted menus and instructions. The hardest part for me was realizing that the yellow composite cord from my peripheral device needed to go into the green port in the back of the tv. After this, I took to the menus and had no trouble mastering them in a matter of seconds. This was my favorite part of the experience early on as it left a lot of extra time to actually enjoy the television rather than rack my brain trying to get the settings I wanted to enjoy the television.Set-Up: 9The set-up was very simple. It needed only a few screws and two people to lift the screen onto its stand. Wall mounts or stabilizers are almost necessary for this television as it could be easily knocked over.Price: 10For this quality, the price of $999 dollars at Best Buy was a steal. It was seven hundred dollars off its regular price. At just over a a thousand here on amazon, it is still a great price. Expect to get more than you paid for.Overall, this is the best television I have ever owned and I won't be getting another as long as this one lives.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bought this from Frys for 1199 and is an excellent TV with little drawbacks", "Author": "P-Square", "ReviewID": "RV39J5ZNG246P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this from Frys for about hundred dollar less than what Amazon was selling.Amazon did not price-match.Why the 4star rating?My old CRT TV with Convertor box picked up 25 channels over the air and yet, the brand new TV only picked up 10 channels and that was disappointing.\"Samsung UN46C5000 46-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LED HDTV\"Pros:1.

I knew it was dying so I spent a couple of months shopping before choosing the UN46S5000. I saw this TV on display and knew pretty much what to expect. One thing you old school HI-FI Buffs or Head Phone wearers might want to know, is that the UN46C5000 does not have RCA Audio Out jacks. It does have an 1/8\" stereo out jack however. So what's the problem? The output is \"line level\" only at a constant db\u00b1. In other words, the remote control will not raise or lower the output. So, if you are intending on using your old stereo system to bring you some really big sound, you will need an AMP with a remote or a surround sound system with a remote.The Good:Good clear picture with good color.Plenty of picture adjustments.A very thin profile.Nice looking.Small energy footprint.Remote is Easy to manage.The bad:Poor range of viewing angles. Not as good as some LCD's.The back light is very noticeable in a completely dark room (typical for LCD TVs).  You will pay hundreds more, however, for local or pinpoint dimming.Audio line level out is unaffected by TV's volume settings.Shiny screen reflects light causing glares.Summary: Good TV for the money.

While I was initially somewhat unsure based on previous reviews I can now conclude that this television is amazing. There is a hint of backlight that bleeds through the black bars when watching wide-screen movies. But if you're not looking for it you'll never notice it. The 60Hz refresh rate is a bit slow for new televisions but I only actually noticed a blur on a few animated television shows. The only major fault in this television is the sound. I tried the built in speakers only once. They were shallow and have no real sound in them. Luckily it's super easy to hook up to my sound system. There are plenty of outputs and inputs for every type of device. The colors are incredibly bright and vivid. The back lighting is precise and clear. The blacks are so dark and the colors jump off the screen. Most of our viewing hours tend to be at night however during the day I love the feature that can increase the brightness according to the light in the room. This keeps it bright even with the sun coming in our windows. The stand and the appearance of the television in general is very attractive and is a strong visual element in our living room. The list of features is incredible and it's possible to customize nearly everything. The television sync's with my media center and with the Samsung bluray player. It's nice that most of the general functions of both devices are controlled via one remote. I also love having the television input, makes it super easy to hook up my media center and stream content via the web or display photos.Overall, this is a great television. It's great quality and a reasonable price. I love it, my wife loves it, and all of our guests are always impressed.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung - UN46C5000", "Author": "RR", "ReviewID": "R1UE1N7CCOJTB9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this product during the Thanks giving.

As most of the TVs are internet Ready TVs, built-in wifi future on samsung would make it peffect.Picture quality is excellent. This TV is 60Hz refresh rate. But, I did not see big difference though. It might matter when I watch, some sports action, etc., But, Hope it should not make much difference for Human eyes.I love this TV and I would recommend it.Its almost 10+ months now. I had to connect my TV to the internet, since I returned my BD player and got a PS3 and have been using PS3 to use netflix. But, now I wanted to use Amazon streaming video and PS3 would not support. Hence, got my TV connected to internet. Just then realized that this Model does not have Internet@TV and No apps available for this Model.

There was no change where ever I was in my room.
