After about 40 days (10 days after the return period), it stopped responding to the remote and the picture began turning blank more and more frequently until eventually it just stayed blank.  Dealing with Westinghouse is a nightmare.  It took me several weeks of trying before I was able to speak with anyone.  The only responses to my e-mails were auto generated and told me to call the same number that was in the product guide. After paying $80 to have it shipped, it shipped back about two weeks later and it was immediately clear it had not been repaired.  When I called Westinghouse, after being on hold for 20 minutes the representative I spoke to could not have been ruder,  I honestly think there is a warrantee process designed to give customers the run around until they give up.  Maybe the worst purchase I've ever made.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "More than just a bad batch, a bad TV in-general. Don't be tempted by price, because this is garbage.", "Author": "Level99", "ReviewID": "R34XUMY1U1V3XK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well, it's nice to know I'm not the only one who purchased this from Best Buy and am experiencing the exact same issues.I bought this from Best Buy #1436 on 10/12/11 as I was building an entertainment setup for numerous old and new video game systems.  I rarely used it but for the first three months it suited my needs.  The sound is absolutely horrible on the built-in speakers, but the headphone-out jack facilitated enough for an external sound system to compensate.  The video quality was slightly below average, but that was to be expected.Then, almost EXACTLY after the 33rd day, I started experiencing some strange picture issues.  For the first week, I got about an hour of use before the picture started going out.  And when I say it started going out, I'm not referring to the inputs not being detected properly.  The audio and video connections were solid, and no matter what kind of input I tried, the picture would still flicker in and out.  Specifically, the picture would start to crush upwards with various scattered green lines.  Spastic flickering accompanied this until the picture just completely cut out, and the audio would still be running.  Sometimes, just waiting would bring the video back temporarily, and then it would go out again in the same way.  Sometimes the video would not come back at all.Here's the kicker: the GUI boxes and menu were succumbing to those symptoms as well, so it was the entire display hardware that was glitching and failing, not the inputs.Restarting it temporarily fixed it at first, but as time went by, the symptoms increased and power cycling no longer remedied it.  You know what started helping temporarily fixing it? Read this slowly: a somewhat forceful jab down on the top of the tv.  YEAH, just like an old CRT getting bad UHF reception, banging on the top of the set helped for a little bit.  I have never in my life seen a digital TV be remedied by physical force that way.  I can only assume that there might be some loose solder on one or more of the internal connections.  I'd attempt to open it and check myself if I weren't afraid it were going to electrically shock me, which considering the possible culprits for this kind of issue, is probable.As of today, the picture doesn't show up at all anymore.  I hadn't used it in about 3 weeks but in that time it apparently decided to just stop working entirely picture-wise.  I haven't tried calling about the warranty yet, however having read what other people have experienced, if Westinghouse tells me to pay for the shipping to have it \"repaired\", I will tell them that I'll spend the money on a sledge instead to get a few last fleeting moments of enjoyment out of the box, and vow to never buy a Westinghouse product ever again.Take it from me: avoid this set for any cost.  In fact, avoid it even if you get it for free.  You'll end up with a very large impractical paperweight.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Device Input Malfunction", "Author": "E.

I don't think there is a single good solder joint here. I have no idea who did the assembly for Westinghouse for this device, but they likely had faulty equipment, judging by what I saw.Happily, if you have a soldering iron, or are willing to go to Radio Shock and invest in a $15 soldering iron and $4 worth of rosin core electronics solder, you can fix this yourself, if you're reasonably mechanically inclined. Here's how:1) Remove all the screws on the back panel, including the screws holding the two small panels on the back of the set closed. Don't miss the four screws holding the stand in place, or the single screw behind the stand once you remove it.2) When you remove the two small panels on the back of the set, disconnect the wires behind them (you'll have to remove some electrical tape to see them). The smaller panel has two small ribbon cables under it, each with a tiny plastic connector. Stick your fingernail under the side of the connector where the wires enter it in each case and pry a little. The connector will \"pop open\" like a door swinging on a hinge, and the ribbon cables will slide easily out. The larger panel has one multi-wire connector. Squeeze it on both ends (there are two tiny metal levers, one on each end--squeeze them) and it will also slide out easily.3) Lay the set down on a soft, flat surface, face (screen) down and remove the entire (large) back cover. This will take patience. There are small plastic clips around the sides that you can't see and that hold it in place; you don't want to break these. It will seem impossible to open at first. Start at the bottom of the set (where the stand attaches) and gently pry open JUST A LITTLE. Then, press inward around the edges (press on the protruding outer edges, toward the center of the TV) and at the same time gently lift on the rear panel just over the place where you're pressing. Work at it for a while. Patience and hand sensitivity is key. You'll get a sense for how it's clipped eventually, and you'll get it off. DO NOT USE FORCE TO PRY THE SET OPEN since this will flex the LED panel and destroy the TV. Patience. You'll get it.4) Once open, DO NOT PULL UP RAPIDLY ON THE BACK COVER. There is one more small wire connector that runs from the front half to the back half of the TV, and that attaches to the red power light and the remote sensor via a small white connector. Wriggle the small white connector until it pops out. Don't pull on the wires; they're very thin single-conductor wires and will break with force. Pull on the connector ONLY as you wiggle it back and forth. Patience is important here, too.5) The set is now open and you'll see the backs of two circuit boards, one for power, one for imaging. You'll also see a bunch of little stiff wires poking up through it, each one with a tiny blob of metal holding it in place. Some of them will be in rows. These are the problem points. They SHOULD be shiny and smooth. Instead, you'll note that they are grey, dirty-looking, and show cracks under a magnifying glass. You're going to \"reflow\" all of these.6) Plug in your soldering iron, let it heat up, coat the tip with the solder you bought, and then, gradually, re-melt all of the little metal blob areas holding wires in place. You may have to hold the soldering iron against each poking-out wire for several seconds to get it to re-melt, and you may have to add a small amount of solder in some cases to get the result to be shiny and smooth. BE CAREFUL NOT TO \"CONNECT\" any of these little blobs or wires together with extra melted metal; none were touching each other when you began, and none should be touching each other once you're done.7) After you've re-melted each little solder joint that you see (do ONLY the ones with wires poking up through them, avoid touching any other areas of solder), reverse the disassembly process carefully to reassemble your TV.If you want the best chance of pulling this off, watch a \"how to solder\" video or two on YouTube to get a feel for what you're aiming for as you fix the numerous cold solder joints inside this set.Once you're done, if you're just a bit lucky, the set will power on and operate as usual, and will no longer suffer from the problems you've been experiencing.Based on the reviews here, it's clear that this particular model went through a completely botched assembly process, which is a shame and a waste of good components and materials (considering how many of these likely ended up in the dumpster). Hopefully Westinghouse has ended its relationship with said assembler, who produced some of the worst solder joints I've seen over the decades I've worked with electronics, something rare for mass production goods (I suspect that there was a faulty equipment issue at this assembler).Because for all intents and purposes this is a defective product as it ships new, and will require repair if it is to continue working for very long, I have to give this set just one star. On the other hand, if you're able to fix this yourself by reflowing the 20-30 solder joints inside (it took me about 45 minutes to get this done, from beginning to end, and I just reflowed all of them because they all looked horrible to me), it's a reasonable set that should then serve you for some time to come.But I doubt I'll buy Westinghouse again--because I don't know whether they're still using that same assembly plant/contractor, and even with the fix made it's 45 minutes of my life I'll never have back, which (at my hourly rate) raises the cost of the set considerably.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good LED Lcd for the price", "Author": "sparta man", "ReviewID": "R1FE72GM4DL72P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a week of buying it from BB and having this in the bedroom, I have to say this is a good buy.

It worked well for about two months, then the problems started.First, on a sporadic basis, the picture would suddenly go blank.  If the TV was left on long enough, it would come back in about ten or fifteen minutes.  Then, after another hour or so, it would go blank again.I called customer support in about November shortly after the problem started happening.  They instructed me to reset the TV to factory settings.  Well, the problem went away for a while, but the picture was just a small square in the middle of the 32\" screen.  Call me crazy, but when I buy a 32\" TV, I don't think its unreasonable to expect the full screen to be used.  I seemed to get a special Westinghouse feature - picture within no picture!  Regardless, I didn't follow up with customer service because at least it had a picture.Then, about a month ago, the picture again started going blank.  Resetting to factory settings didn't help, and it recently started happening every time we turned on the set.Last night was the end.  The TV would not power up at all.I called customer service today, and was told the TV was still under warranty (yes!).  However, I would have to pay to ship the TV to Houston TX to get it fixed.  The rep told me after putting me on hold that they could not waive the shipping charges, it was their policy.  They would not send a technician to my house, either.So, basically I was sold a defective TV, and now have to pay about $90 to pack and ship it to Houston because of its poor workmanship.  That's not going to happen.  Instead, I will chuck the thing into the garbage, and never, ever, ever, ever buy a Westinghouse product again.The sad thing is that Westinghouse made plenty of money selling me junk.  My cost to get it fixed is too high, so I'm off to buy another TV.  Meanwhile, Westinghouse gets to keep all of their money off of my sale.  They do need to own up to their problem, but refuse to do it.  Well, only at further expense to me, the consumer.Judging by the other reviews of this product, my experience is not unique.

(The only way I can interpret this is that they know it's a glitchy TV, and won't buy it themselves)The good news (as of June 2012) - when we called Westinghouse, they eventually sent us a prepaid Fed Ex shipping label.The bad news1) Had to ship from Honolulu to Texas.2) Fed Ex will not pack a TV this size, so you have to pack something that the shipping experts won't.3) U-Haul has a ninety dollar box this size, designed for TVs.  I found a twenty dollar box at the UPS store, and a couple rolls of bubble wrap at Walmart, before taking this to Fed Ex4) It took 21 days to ship, repair, and return it5) Their packaging consisted of 4 folded pieces of foam and a plastic bag - much more poorly packed than mine6) The screws to hold the TV to the base were not returned, so I'm still waiting on getting replacement screws sent from Westinghouse before I can reassemble and test the TV (I could probably measure the holes and find replacements at the hardware store, but this is Westinghouse's mistake - I have photos to show I sent them the screws, so they can fix it).So, if you want to deal with snarky customer service, drive to multiple places to deal with the shipping, and have no TV for close to a month, go ahead and order this (actually, we hooked up the 1996 TV - that at least still works).  If it works when they send me the rest of the parts, great.  If not, I give up and will get a new one.  In either case, this company has lost our business for good.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible TV and Customer Service", "Author": "KjFlyer", "ReviewID": "R3DUCU8XP144K5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Where to start on this gem of electronic mediocrity. I received this gift for Christmas (2011). Setup was easy and the picture was very good for the first 4 months. Then subtle lines started to develop on the screen running horizontally. First I thought it was video game that was glitching out. Nope not so lucky. Within a week these lines would morph into solid bands and then the screen would completely black out after 5-10 minutes rendering it a big flat sound box (not even a radio. After speaking to customer service and sending them arbitrary photos of the TV I sent it down to Texas. To their credit they sent it back very quickly but only to find that they failed to package the screws allowing for the base of the TV to be attached to the stand. Also the bezel was chipped and broken running along the bottom of the screen. I can tell you without a doubt my packaging job exceeded how they returned to the TV to me. The best part is I opened a case file with them in May and I paid for shipping from Ohio to Texas which makes zero sense. Your product broke with months of purchase and I have to fork over money to send it in for repair. Wonderful business model.I then call to have screws and a new bezel shipped to me along with a demand for reimbursement for shipping cost. I am told that Westinghouse now offers pre-payed shipping labels starting June of 2012 but since I opened a file in May 2012 I could not be reimbursed. How is that my problem? What a joke.Westinghouse used to be a respectable brand but they are bottom of the barrel now. Stick with the big dogs Samsung, Sony, LG etc.I just hope this thing lasts a few years and then I will never buy Westinghouse again. Stay far and away from this company. If you made the mistake of buying this or similar models hold onto the box!

My daughter kept telling me that it would go black after a while watching it. Now it only plays the sound and no picture. You would think that there would be a recall on this, but I have not seen one. I did not expect to have only six months of usage from a product. Westinghouse should be ashamed of themselves, a once highly regarded product name now a piece of manure. Best Buy should be ashamed of themselves for hearing of this problem and not taking a stand for their customers. I guess you should buy the insurance when purchasing from Best Buy, they know something we don't.
