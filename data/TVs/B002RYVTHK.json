{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung 933HD+ Review", "Author": "Ken Stanfield", "ReviewID": "R112G5O2BTTPZU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS: Kinda surprised that I'm the first person to write a review for this great 19\" HDTV from Samsung. I guess 19\" (actually, 18.5\") monitors are not all that popular as they're generally too small for anything but a smallish space.  In my case, I use it in my office adjacent to a pair of Samsung 2233 21.5\" monitors that my wife and I use.The 933HD+ is a great little HDTV/Monitor that's just perfect for the space I have.  The colors are vibrant (I'm using an HDMI connection from my Comcast cable box) and the refresh rate is fine for football games and other high-motion broadcasts.  The speakers are another matter (see below) but I bought this monitor for its picture, not for its sound.  I've also used the analog D-SUB connector to hook this up to my computer as a second monitor (with a digital DVI connection going to the Samsung 2233SW).  Works great for Netflix streams! The screw-in monitor stand was trivially easy to attach.  Overall, a great small HDTV at a great price.CONS: The biggest issue with this monitor is the underwhelming speakers.  There just isn't much low end from the stock, tinny speakers.  I knew this in advance and my solution is to just use a an extra set of Boston Acoustics computer speakers (along with a sub-woffer) using the headphone out 3.5mm jack on the back of the TV.  Now it sounds great! The remote works, but it is hardly an icon of sleek design. Another gripe has to do with the Ultra-Mega shiney black finish.  The finish is so polished that it reflects everything.  Right now, I can see the reflection from all the Christmas lights in my house, and frankly I find this somewhat annoying.  A matte-black finish would have been MUCH, MUCH better.  Also, this things shows off fingerprints and dust like there's no tomorrow.Also noticed that depending on the viewing angle, the color vibrance and brightness can vary pretty significantly.  This is the case with all LCD monitors, not just this one.  But no big deal-breakers here.OVERALL: For the price, I don't think there's a better value out there.  The cons I noted have *nothing* to do with the performance of the monitor, either.  Rather, they are cosmetic issues that are totally ignorable. I wish there were some after-market height-adjustable stands that attached to the base on these monitors.  I find them to be just a little too low to the table for my tastes.  Maybe Samsung will offer something like this as as accessory down the road (assuming they standardize on this screw-on based for all monitors/HDTV's in this class). The buttons on the side of the monitor are hard to use, but thankfully you don't need to interact with them very much -- set 'em once, then forget about 'em.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect.", "Author": "Colin P.

Mccants", "ReviewID": "RDE8AX1ATDI3W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i am more than pleased with this piece of gear, but my impression may be influenced by the fact that its my first hdtv and its football season.i use practically all the connections in the back and it makes it a very flexible device. i wont prattle on but just suffice to say that PIP (picture in picture) would really improve the functionality.with computer and multiple television inputs the device could simultaneous serve multiple functions but for whatever reason the PIP feature was not included. it couldn't be cost as PIP is more a software function (i could be wrong), so all i can think is they skimped on memory/cpu.there is a usb port and documentation alludes to a firmware update capability, but i'm dreaming now.anyway the only other thing i can say is amazon didn't charge me tax or the recycling fee (that saved me [...]).", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung 933HD+ Review", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R3I87AC00OC9BJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for my son's bedroom in his college apt to use as a personal TV / DVD display. Was very impressed with the ease of setup and the excellent video performance. His cable input is SD which tends to look a bit cartoon-ish on a set designed for HD, but after playing a bit with the video settings to suit his cable signal and room lighting, I was able to get excellent results. Movie mode worked best with the SD signal for his smaller rather dark space BTW.I was prepared to rush right out and buy a pair of external powered speakers for this since audio for a small set like this is usually underwhelming. I was actually afraid the audio would be similar to his laptop computer which is almost unusable, but this was surprisingly good for what it is. You end up using nearly the whole setting range depending upon the source, but it is quite usable for a small space where you aren't moving around a lot or having to suit people seated all over the place. I'm going to add a pair of decent powered external speakers to it for him, but it is quite serviceable as is for the purpose it was purchased for (A personal bedroom TV for a small bedroom) and the video as mentioned earlier is excellent if you take the time to tweak it if you're not feeding an HD signal into it. I never had a chance to try an HD signal into it, but I'm sure it would do very well.The selection of input types / PC adaptability make this a versatile unit too. I would definitely buy another of these for a small space/dedicated use.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wrong size", "Author": "Laura Beth Perry", "ReviewID": "R2PM9QU6D3TW8W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It was too small for my boyfriend's console.

Only down sides I can think of is that the sides are almost too glossy for my tastes, and the mount is not adjustable so I can't tilt.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but this one was already open box", "Author": "RoundOut", "ReviewID": "R360RVZDE3ZF21", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Wife ordered this TV to replace one we purchased at Sam's club.  It arrived OK, but was obviously an open box.  Amazon was great and accepted the return with full refund.  Not sure how an item advertised as new came as a return/open box item though.
