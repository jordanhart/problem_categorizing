{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for mini home theater", "Author": "EarlyMon", "ReviewID": "R12YOYVGGH37PP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been an HDTV owner for six years and during that time, I've assisted about two dozen friends in their HDTV home theater setups.  I've just upgraded to the Samsung LN52B750 and I couldn't be happier.  For reference, I'm upgrading from a Samsung DLP and I own another Samsung LCD HDTV.There's a lot that's misunderstood about this TV, so rather than the usual Pros and Cons, I'd like to share how I'm getting viewing value from this set.First, if you're reading this, you're either already an LCD owner or have read about them - and have read about this new breed and if you're like I was, you're wondering what's what.Color swirls - you never read about this, but if you've watched TV on an LCD set in the past, especially with standard def (SD) stations, you've seen it.  The backgrounds look like compressed colors from jpg photo files.  My earlier LCD HDTV (8ms response time) had it - this one simply does not.  (I did have trouble watching compression artifacts in a movie from 1930 on TCM on this TV - but that movie was so hosed, I can't blame the TV only.)Contrast - you've read by now that all LCD set makers lie about this.  If you're confused and remember the old audio days, that works like this:  You'd have a 35 watt RMS/channel amp (into 8 ohms).  Some would lie and call it a 70 watt amp.  Then lie some more and call it a 140 watt amp (how about 4 ohm speakers?).  Then lie some more and refer to peak instead of RMS - and suddenly a 35 watt amp is legally lied about as a 200 watt amp.  Now - I don't know the ins and outs of legal contrast lying, but I believe what I've read - it exists in this industry.  This set is rated at a contrast of 150,000:1 - with every stretch of legal lying possible - the contrast on this set is amazing.  I still cannot believe that it's an LCD.  It's simply that good in terms of contrast.  One plasma-owning friend insisted for a half hour that I was wrong, and had gotten a top line plasma.Blur/response/lag - LCDs are noted for this weakness.  Not this TV. Read on.Quality of SD programs - some controversy exists.  Not a problem on this TV.  Read on.240 Hz AMP - this is the most misunderstood feature I've read about on this TV.  Nothing I've read in any review prepared me for what to expect.  I was buying the TV partially for this feature, noting that depending upon whom you believe, you turn this feature on, off, on for movies but not sports, on for sports but not movies.It's none of those on/off things.  It's adjustable.  Here are my simple recommendations based on my setup:1.  DirecTV.I use a Dayton HDMI cable, also bought on Amazon (amazingly good cable - buy it), from my DirecTV HR20.  I have the HR20 set up to display all resolutions in Native mode.  The LN52B750 switches resolution so quickly that this is not a problem.  Unlike earlier sets I've owned, the HDMI input on this TV accepts 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p - the HR20 outputs all of those on HDMI.  In DirecTV circles, it's well-known to set your TV and your HR20 to the TV's native resolution and turn Native output off on the HR20.  This is because the HR20 is purportedly better at 3:2 pulldown processing than the top of the line chipsets/firmware used only a few years ago, in that the pulldown is done between the steps of converting the satellite signal to TV frames - and my own experience agreed with that.However, I offer this simple advice - set your HR20 output to Native, all resolutions, and set the B750's 240Hz processing to: Blur=5, Judder=3 - and you'll be exceptionally happy with the results from all program input.  My Boston Legal reruns have never looked so good and they appear on some of the poorest-signal (highly compressed) stations in my lineup.  So, with this setting, SD as well as satellite 720p and 1080i programs look great - not fake at all.  (And all you have to do to see the controversy on this feature is to \"turn it on\" without customizing its adjustment - and wait for your eyes and stomach to turn.)I played baseball as a kid - loved it.  Still remember what a ball looks like going through the air.  When you're at the right angle, you see a stobe of blur and clear, red stitches.  With the Blur=5,Judder=3 adjustment, I have finally seen just that watching a dropping curve ball (720p source).  Any higher or lower, the ball looks wrong - oh, yes, very exciting - but wrong.So I strongly recommend this set for its 240 Hz processing - providing you are willing to change those two parameters slowly and study a lot of source material to dial in what's right.  I contend that if you're a DirecTV HR20 owner, I've just given you the key to really great SD and HD viewing.And don't fear about those great blurs being missed from movies that wanted it there - Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire looked really great in that regard.BTW - resolution switching on this set is FAST - you'll experience little or NO extra delay when switching resolutions.  (Not true on my older HDTVs.)2.  HTPC (Home Theater PC)I use a Mac mini.  I know, people hate them, you pay too much for Macs, yadda, yadda, yadda.  The Mac mini is THE correct form-factor for a HTPC.  You can find duplicates of this form-factor - and directly comparable features - in the Windows world for **exactly** the same price as a Mac mini - so, 'nuff said on price.But - so far as a I know, only the built-in Apple DVD Player plays movies at 24 frames/second.  Last I checked (and this may have changed by now), all other software (Win) does playback at TV rates: 60 frames/sec, with progressive scanning, etc.Now - I'm not explaining all of this to brag about Macs - this is all about Blu-Ray vs. DVDs.The de-judder tech being targeted by the 240 Hz processing is all about reconciling Blu-Ray 24 fps (read: real theater) vs. 30/60 fps (read: TV signals).I don't own a Blu-Ray player - my gut, after all of these years, is still telling me to wait for the right features and prices.But, I do use a Mac mini for my HTPC and if you do - or are considering one - here is my recommendation (based on Leopard 10.5.7): set the DVD Player to Best Quality Deinterlacing, set the Mac Display preferences to 1920x1080 at 24 Hz (it's progressive by default), and feed that into your LN52B750 with the 240 Hz options set to Blur=5 or 6, Judder=6 or 7 - and your jaw will drop.  If you have a copy of Moulin Rouge - use it as your reference for the settings.  I particularly recommend noting that you'll actually see the dust kitties on the floor in the Tango Roxanne chapter (among other things) and also suggest that you'll really love the depth and details of the stars, lace and glitter in Your Song.With those settings you'll not only get a great HTPC, but you'll get possibly the best standard DVD player you've ever owned.  Before the LN52B750, it was very good - now it's really incredible.  Ghost Dog and Moulin Rouge on DVD are now completely three dimensional (not exaggerated foreground fakey - actually 3-D looking) - I didn't even know that this sort of picture was possible from a DVD.I think my setup shows how well this TV works with a 1080p/24 fps source - I can only imagine that Blu-ray looks even better.(edited 5-26-09)3.  SoundPeople complain about the sound quality of the LN52B750.  I don't know.  I haven't used a TV for sound in 8 years.  I don't wish to sound snobbish, but really - you're spending a boatload on your TV and input sources, why listen to TV speakers?I don't go for surround sound.  I'm an audio purest that prefers the highest fidelity stereo.  To each his own, but if you're like me, here's the secret on that:  route the optical audio out from the LN52B750 into the Mac mini, not from the DirecTV's optical port.  This routing is surprisingly better.  Use Rogue Amoeba's free LineIn software, set all buffers to default values except for output - use a buffer size of 2048 - convert the optical to copper stereo and pipe that into your stereo system.  This is the best TV-to-stereo sound I've gotten in 8 years.I'm using large electrostatic panels, driven by a 400 watt (peak)/channel amp and a 2 kW servo-controlled subwoofer.  You hear sound from all over the room and the depth and spacial qualities are great.  I recommend more money into a better stereo and less room wiring over surround sound, but that's just me.  To each, his own.4.  Miscellaneous AdjustmentsNext, some words on clouding, screen adjustment and glare.Glare - I don't have any.  Yeah - I can see some reflection in the screen at various times of the day.  The picture quality is so deep - as is the contrast - that I don't even notice glare, if it is there.  And the screen is neither glossy nor matte.  It feels glossy, but is low-glare like matte, but sharp and clear like glossy.  They're telling the truth on that improvement.Clouding - let the set burn in for a few days before looking.  This is great advice for any large LCD, by the way.  Clouding - I don't have any.Adjustments:  Go. Very. Slow.  I'd recommend not touching a thing for a full 24 hours of viewing.  So far, I've turned down the backlight and the contrast and turned up the brightness.  I'm not going to suggest numbers here, though - there are too many factors, such as your room, that will dictate what's right.  I will say that out of the box, the contrast is too high, as is the backlight (but not the brightness) - so, as I said: Adjust. Each. Parameter. Slowly.  You'll be pleased.5-26-09: Three things - absolutely *turn off* Dynamic Contrast and Edge Enhancement!!  Also, Digital Noise Reduction (NR) defaults to auto - certainly on DVDs, this causes an electric sort of look to things like paper; better at Medium or High.Color - I read a review that favored Auto over Native - I agree.Film mode - It defaults to Auto2 (optimized for scrolling text).  Use Auto1 (film optimized) - text looks just fine.5.  InternetThis is not a worthless feature.  I thought it would be - but it isn't.  If you're using a Mac mini and getting the net wirelessly, go to System Prefs->Network->Ethernet, and set DHCP with manual IP - set IP to 192.168.2.1 - then go to Sharing and share your Airport connection through the Ethernet.  Run an Ethernet cable 100/1000BaseT type (looks like a big phone connector) from the Mac to the TV.  Set the TV internet as follows: IP=192.168.2.2, mask=255.255.255.0, and BOTH Gateway and DNS Servers to 192.168.2.1 - and you're all set.Note - this doesn't support your DLNA features into the TV - and if you have a HTPC, especially a Mac, you don't want that anyway.  Your music files will all have to transcode to support the feature - stick with your native music format, and simply switch to Mac Front Row for your music listening.  You'll get higher quality and you've already made those music import decisions - and I suspect the same is true if you're a Vista/Home Media user and that's your HTPC. (Update - with [...] software, this config does support DLNA features from Mac to TV - if you need that sort of thing.)BUT - and this is a big BUT - if it's easy, hook up your Mac or other HTPC to share its internet connection.  You already get your OS upgrades via the net, regardless of whether you prefer OS X or Windows.  Well, guess what?  This TV is at its heart, a whole lot of computing technology.  Out of the box, my LN52B750 firmware was marked from 3-30-2009 - and last week (in May 2009), Samsung already had a firmware upgrade for this set.  What did Samsung upgrade?  I don't know and I don't care.  I let my Windows XP and Mac OS X computers upgrade themselves all the time.  These guys want to fix things for free, I don't argue - I take the fix.Get it connected to the internet and you'll never have to sweat getting an upgrade or remember how to transfer it to your TV via a USB stick.  For upwards of US$2k, I like not sweating things.  BTW, please note that at this point, the TV doesn't seem to support automatic updates - so you still have to go over to that menu option.  Not bad. (10-13-2009 update: firmware updates are now automatic if hooked to the net.)Having gotten that far, I tried out the Yahoo widgets.  This is an underrated feature by far.  I'm now set up to get the quick 5-day forecasts here, back where Mom is, and out where my company's other locations are.  It puts the TV show being watched into its own shadowbox while viewing the widget.  This is insanely faster and easier than using my Mac Dashboard or the DirecTV widget for the same thing - and I never lost track of my show and I never picked up a mouse.Oh - I also used Yahoo News and Video to get the latest web video of the Hubble repairs during a long commercial break.  Sure, it was low-res.  But I did it with my remote, and not a mouse, and didn't lose track of time on the web looking at Hubble stuff during a commercial break.So - I strongly recommend the internet connection option for this TV, too.6.  HeatLCD sets get hot, the longer they're on.  I burned out my first LCD HDTV from days-long ontime.  I left this TV on for 50 hours straight.  It is summer (here in the desert),  and I do have my swamp cooler on - but this TV screen is still barely warm to the touch.7.  Trusting commercial reviewersAnyone who publishes that they've tested the X-inch model of this set, but this one is the same - don't read them, don't believe them.  Quality control for manufacturing LCD sets increases almost exponentially as you go up in size.  Only trust reviews on the actual set you're looking at - not the next one over, not last year's model.8.  LCD response timeThis set is rated at 2 ms.  I've heard that's a lie in a review of 120 Hz sets - although the reviewer wouldn't mention manufacturers.  That reviewer said that they were simply taking 8 ms panels, and rating them at 4 ms when doing 120 Hz processing - and so, while my TV was in transit, I rightly wondered if the 2 ms is simply the same math applied to an 8 ms screen at 240 Hz (4 time as fast as 60 Hz, four times as fast as 8 ms).I have no earthly idea.  All that I can say for a certain fact is that this thing is razor sharp and lacks the motion artifacts (and swirls) I've seen on my other 8 ms LCD HDTVs.  I hope this helps, some, with that confusion.9.  Actual SizeI don't why it does this but it does:  it sees my Mac via the DVI-HDMI connection and gives me a Fit Screen size adjustment.  No more lost pixels, no more need for SwitchResX or DisplayConfigX.  No such option from the DirecTV HDMI input.  I don't know why.But I do know this:  for years, HDTV makers were hiding a bit of the edges from their input sources - causing no end of grief for HTPC owners.  This set does away with all of those woes.(**** UPDATE, May 23 - The Screen Fit option works with any HD source - DirecTV or HTPC.  Switch to 480i input, and the screen fit option goes away.  Also - when you get the typical HistoryHD show where they just stretch the letterbox picture horizontally, giving everyone that Pillsbury Doughboy face, you can fix that by quickly switching the TV to 4:3 mode.  You end up with an HD in letterbox - not as good as full-screen HD, but way better than watching the Pillsbury Doughboy.)10.  Correct Adjustment.They tell us that the only way to do this is with a TV tech, and to pay for it professionally.  Believe them.  This TV has no less than 9 adjustments for red, green and blue - add in brightness, gamma, etc and you have over a dozen adjustments there.Think: 12-sided Rubic's cube - now you've got the idea.So, I'm just adjusting the brightness/backlight/contrast myself.  Independent reviewers all claim that the Samsung brand rocks right out of the box for color correctness.  That wasn't true of my older Samsungs - it most certainly is for this one.  The color just looks great.13.  The RemoteI had things down to just my Mac remote and my DirecTV remote.  Now I've got that third remote happening again, to use some of this TV's cooler features.  Just like most people use surround sound while I use stereo, it seems most people get integrated remotes instead of using several.OK - I'm a Luddite or something.  We use multiple remotes.  (This one for music, sound, photos and DVD control, this one for DirecTV and now this one for switching source inputs and checking out my Yahoo widgets.)  My wife and I just find this easier.  So, if you're like us in that regard:This is a great remote.  It feels comfy in the hands like you wouldn't believe, it has backlighting, the buttons are big enough to read.  What more can I say than that?14.  Viewing DistanceI watch mine at 12.5 feet from the screen.  This is well within reason for this size TV.  If you watch at a showroom, be prepared to pace off what your viewing distance will be.  I often go through stores and see people judging HDTVs by being 8 feet in front of one, 12 feet in front of another.  Don't ever do that.  I cannot overstate the importance of judging TVs from the distance consistent with your own use.15.  Pilot DeliveryI got my LN52B750 via Amazon's supplied Pilot Delivery.  These guys were great.  Others have had issues, many haven't.  Pilot seems to employ local guys for their white glove delivery.  My local guys were great - 'nuff said.16.  6/13/2009 edit - If you register your TV on the Samsung website, they give you an additional 3 months on your warranty.Well - that's it.  Thanks for reading.  Hope I've helped.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Pictures !!!!", "Author": "Songhai", "ReviewID": "RX97YD8F5P4AG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A caution about this LCD before the praises.....1. It is wide...you need a second pair of hands to help you get it out of the box and mount it, if you are like me who was eager to mount it all by myself, you will end up with acute low back pain..oooh.2. Do not dispose of the large box it came in,it will be hard to find a box this large just in case you got a faulty set and have to send it back.3.Prices are coming down, shop around and buy from a retailer that will price match for you.4.Samsung has an awful customer service buy from a retailer with a reliable warranty history.Now to the review.......Like most reviewers, I had spent months researching into LCDS and came out impressed with Sony V100, XBR6, XBR8(LED),Samsung B750 and B8000(LED).The Samsung B750 came out tops in all categories combininig the strengths from each one into one beautiful TV ....I will not go into much technicalities as one of the reviewers here \"EarlyMon\" did a fantastic job and is more techsavvy.I will only say that I am more than happy with my purchase.However, I shall add that the future of HDTV will be either LED or OLED.The technology on LED/OLED TV has not been perfected and will not be until 3 to 5 years down the road.So, why did I go for a SAMSUNG B750 CCRT LCD TV rather than for a LED TV?Very simple.It is the best LCD in the market as of today Sept14th,2009 and might be for a long time to come.A point supported by both professional reviewers and users.The Samsung B750 beats the LED Sony XBR8 (too pricey) and Samsung B8000 (uneven pixation). It compares very well with black scenes in both LED TVs, the white may not be as white as the LED TVs, but IT does not give the unnatural blue hue the LED TVs add to white color, perhaps that is why they seem to produce a whiter white.Just like the LED tv, the Samsung LN52B750 does not produce harsh pictures nor are the pictures scrabby.The B750 has a practical wider viewing angle than both LED TVs mentioned above. It also has a better uniformity of colours.Do not get me wrong the LED TVs give very impressive pictures but since they are still in what I shall call beta stages, the prices on them are rather high for their current performances compared to what they are capable of doing.Just Like when Plasmas came out some years back, they were pricey, average cost was $4000.00 for the low end models.Inspite of their high prices then, yesterday's Plasmas in terms of performance are not as good as today's Plasmas which cost far less. They went through a period of fine tuning during which time their prices came down.Could you imagine buying a 46in Plasma for $900:00 in 2004.Yet today you could get one for that amount with little issue of burn in and better performance. A similar scenario will be played out with the LED TVs of today. So while waiting for LED technology to be perfected, it makes reasonable sense to buy an excellent TV at a \"reasonable cost\" to enjoy for the next 5 or so many years before the LED TVs get perfected or near \"perfection\".To be honest, as much as Samsung tried to eliminate glare, this TV does have a minimum of glare compared to older Samsung LCDs but it is very minimal.If you have not noticed the glare on your laptop, desktop or your old CRT tv, then you will not be bothered by glare on this TV with the improved anti-glare technology.If you are an enthusiast of Nature,fast action movies or sports, this is the TV for you. This TV shows leaves in a tree distinctively not just a bunch or cluster of green like most TVs do.You see clearly the individual droplets of water, as a wave breaks not just a splash of whitishblue.With fast movies or sports, no blurr or motion artifacts are seen.Colors are naturally vivid.No leaking of colors.Do you need calibration? Yes, you do. Out of the box, the picture it gives is very impressive.Bear in mind that the manufacturers do not know anything about your living room light condition but they have a fairly good knowledge of what the light condition of a retailer's electronic dept is like.An since, the manufacturers do not know which of their TVs will be displayed by a particular retailer, they adjust the settings on all of their TVs coming out of the production line to meet the light conditions of a retailer which most time is a very bright light condition.They want their TV to look brighter,sharper and more crisp than their competitors'. This might mean less than an optimal picture quality for your room and more energy cost for you. Calibration has also been touted to prolong the life of the pixels.So if you can afford the 2 grand on this TV why can't you pick up a calibrating disc for $30.00 or less, to get an optimal performance, lower energy cost and prolong the life span of your TV?If you decide to calibrate your TV,it is adviced to let your new TV break in, like a new car before making the adjustment.Some suggest as few as 24 hrs of regular TV watching others have suggested 1 month.I calibrated mine after 45 hrs of regular TV watching.The difference in picture quality after calibration is like NIGHT and DAY.There are quite some good calibrating discs out there but the best for video is \"High Deifinition Benchamrk by Spears & Munsil\". This is very simple to use, the instructions are very elementary.I recommend the Blu-ray edition, if you have a Blu-ray player. For audiophiles, \"AIX RECORDS\" audio calibration disc is a winner. It has HD music sampler.For those with  surround system, it will test the output and locate the positions of each of your speakers one by one for you.Both discs  can be purchased online and for those who purchase the OPPO-BD 83 Blu-ray player,it is an added bonus.However, for those who do not want to buy a calibration disc or pay for a professionl calibration service, here is an ABC of do it yourself calibration.The primary features involved in calibration are, brightness,contrast,sharpness,color and hue.Brightness:This controls the depth of the blackness.Slot in a DVD movie into your DVD player and look for a night scene with someone wearing a black suit.Adjust the brightness control until you can make out clearly the edges of the suit lapel and the breast pocket of the black suit.Contrast:Controls the white. Look for a scene of someone wearing a white shirt.Adjust the contrast control until you can make out clearly the white buttons on the white shirt.Sharpness:Slot in a sports DVD e.g football,athletes meet, lawn tennis match etc.Look for a scene with line markings.Play with the adjust control from minimum to maximum and watch the line markings as you do so,  the lines will have doubles or  ghost images.Adjust the control slowly until the double or triple lines become one line or the ghost images of the line dissappears, leaving you with a single line.Color:Hopefully, you are not color blind.If you are,ask a friend to help you with this adjustment.This adjustment depends on what you appreciate of skin tone.Focus on the color of the skin of the actors, usually the face.Play with the control up and down and see how the skin color changes.Adjust the control more slowly until you get a match close to what the person's color would look like to you,were the person standing close to you.Hopefully, you are not in the habit of looking for aliens or martians.Hue:Also refers to color.Look for a color like red, blue or green and adjust the control to get the nearest match of that color in real life.These tips are to help you make a decision between the best available HDTV to date.And if you are like me who was debating between a CCRT LCD OR LED LCD, I hope that I have provided sufficient reasons why I went for a CCRT LCD rather than a LED LCD for now. I might upgrade to a LED TV in five years from now.Happy viewing on your new TV. You can not go wrong on Samsung LN52B750 !Addendum (01/29/2010):AESTHETICS:We have had this TV for about 5 months now. No problems with it.And we have never been bored looking at it, either when it is turned ON or OFF.It is a beautiful piece and blends very well with other pieces of furniture in our family room.The black screen overlaps beautifully with the black frame.The design remains ever sleek and unobtrusive.SOUND:I have often wondered at the comments people have made about the sound quality not being loud enough. We have our TV hooked up to a Phillips 6 piece  surround system that was already in place before the TV arrived.But without the surround system the TV Sound is fine.Our son prefers to play his game without the surround system and finds the inbuilt TV speakers more than adequate for him and neither have his friends complained when they come arround.For a TV this size and varying on the size of your room, a soundbar or an external surround system should be a fitting addition to the TV.Caution, if you do use an external speaker source with the TV remember to turn off the TV volume so that you do not get an echoing effect.

Absolutely stunning,jaw dropping picture. I can't say enough about it. Excellent blacks,infinitely tweakable to your liking.When I first turned it on I had the \"The Office\" come on and I swear my mouth stayed open for a few minutes as it looked like Michael was in the same room as me! Lots of inputs and features to this set,internet connectivity,DLNA,home networking,wonderful subdued TOC which is grey instead of the red on last years 750. Very high gloss bezel,crystal neck stand which pivots. Screen is glossy,reflections are not an issue for me as I tend to watch in a darker room,but even with the drapes open, I don't see myself! AMP seems to work better in this set,as I also have an 4071 Samsung which has a slight problem with AMP,which has been well documented over at the AVSForums.Just like anything else it is not perfect,hence the 4 stars instead of 5.Sound is bad. I mean,you'll want to hook this up to a nice stereo system,or at the very least,a couple of powered computer speakers or some such set.This tv attracts dust like nobodies business.Either that or my house is really dirty. Front panel controls (which would be rarely used anyway) are hard to tell where they are (lower right). Yahoo widgets,which are kind of cool when you first see them,are eh,no big deal. Maybe as more become available I'd be more excited.There is no printed manual,it's on a usb drive,called an e-manual,and no it's not Spanish! There's some uneven lighting when screen is dark,(no signal)not sure if that's an issue for me yet,doesn't seem to affect any picture quality,but something to keep an eye on.It is a 5 star tv,but the sound is what drops it 1.

Called Samsung for support and a local repair person will come to the house.  But kinda worried if I have a lemon or a TV that will constantly need to be repaired.I would give Amazon 5 stars for the great price they had on the tv and 5 stars to the delivery company that delivered the tv on the date I wanted.But for the TV itself it was great for 1 day but now the picture is an eyesore.  I will keep this review updated about how Samsung will deal with their problem TV.UPDATE:  Contacted by local Samsung repair shop.  They were very friendly and helpful but told me it could be a panel problem and they would have to order it and the first day they could come would be in about 8 days.I decided that I didn't want to wait for a repair and basically didn't want a refurbished tv right out the box and have to worry about other problems occuring down the road.

I saw the ln46b650 as it stood out from the rest with clarity.  So i decided to take a gamble and pre order this one.  I even owned a pn50a760 plasma and sent it back because it had poor clearity.  This t.v has an extra setting for the upscaling which makes it ajust to the size making it a little clearer for normal dvds then the regular upscaling.PROs for this t.v:  Clearest picture i've seen so far for LCD.  No artifacts on 240hz settings.  The colors are bright and stunning.  For you video game addicts.  I have a ps3 and a xbox360 hooked up to it and let me tell you the game looks crisp and has no lag whats so ever.Cons:The internet capabilities and media stuff arent exciting.  Only thing its good for is maybe knowing the weather and uploading pictures on the tv when having family events.  When people speak while playing video games they seem a little quiet other then that they sound pretty decent.  The blacks are probally the best you can get for lcd but its still not as black as plasmas can get.  Only other thing is its viewing angles, its best to sit at a centerish seat.THe cons are very very minor overall this t.v I will recommend to anyone looking for something great in all area's for the price. Regular Dvds look nice a sharp and blue rays look even better. Even my girlfriend that knows nothing about t.vs says WOW thats a lot better then the other one we sent back.  YOu could also see the jealousy in my friends eyes.I hope my technical comments help you decide if this is the t.v for you.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very Impressive LCD TV from Samsung!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R29USLM6A3SSS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was time to upgrade from analog so this is our first HDTV.  After six months of research, we knew we wanted a Samsung.  And with the recent Amazon rebate, we were able to snag this for only a couple hundred more than last year's model.The size is perfect for our room and the sofa is about 12 feet away.  We have the Samsung LN52B750, Samsung HT-BD1250 Blu-ray Home Theater System and DirecTv HD DVR.  The set has a very quality look and feel to it.  The set had a minor flaw on the edge of the bezel out of the box and Samsung sent out a tech to replace it with no problem.This LCD TV has a wonderful picture and is perfect for our living room layout.  All settings seemed perfect right out of the box.  With the ability to choose different picture modes (dynamic, standard, natural and movie) we have not had any need to change any color settings.  The TV sound alone is quite adequate, but the Home Theater System is a great investment if it is in your budget, as it gives movie viewing a true theater feel.The TV comes pre-loaded with a content library.  We found that to be a neat extra, but don't really use the content library.  The content library contains a beautiful, classical artwork slideshow that would be great to silently play when you have company but don't need the television.  Pandora is a great, free, internet music service that is preloaded.  You set up your account online and run an ethernet cable to your internet wireless router or pick up a Samsung WIS09ABGN LinkStick Wireless LAN Adapter.  We ordered the LinkStick and it has worked great.  The TV also has Netflix preloaded and the LinkStick will work with that, as well.  You have to go to Netflix online to setup and purchase service to stream movies.  We plan to do this soon.Ordered Mediabridge - 6ft Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Ray and found the six foot length to be fine with the set unmounted but will have to order longer cables if we decide to mount the unit on the wall.  We also ordered the Sanus Systems Low Profile Universal Flat Panel Mount 32\" to 60\" Displays.  We found that the low-profile wall-mount would not work with the cables coming out of the back as there was not enough wall clearance so we sent that back and will order a tilting or articulating mount later. However, we were impressed with the quality of the Sanus and will choose that brand when it is time to purchase.We were stuck with our regular DirecTv receiver and antenna until they could get out to install the HD service.

In my opinion, the only LED lit tv you might even consider waiting for would be the high end models that will feature local dimming. I'd expect them to cost about twice as much as this set.  Anyway - I'm totally satisfied with my LN52B750.  It has none of the issues my edge lit LED model had (such as dark spots in the corners and more noticeable light bleed through on dark scenes) and in my opinion the PQ is every bit as good, if not better.  My LN52B750 produces a very even black screen with no noticeable \"clouding\" or \"flashlighting\".  Blu ray movies look fantastic.  Xbox 360 games look and play fantastic as well.

Check out AVSForum, Forums Tab, LCD Flat panel displays, then LNxxB750. Can't rely on the Geek Squad or sales people to steer you right. Monster HDMI Cables Anyone? For the record, in HDMI, it's a digital signal. It's either there or it's not. You can get cables from Amazon or monoprice (see top of AVS Forum) for $3 that will do just the same job as Monster and leave you feeling good.I've seen a lot of reviews that cover picture quality and features ect. but nothing that really covers gaming on a 360. I use my tv for 90% gaming and 10% Tv and Blu-ray. Onto the Gaming.Input Lag:This probably the biggest concern most often vocalized by gamers and the biggest overall concern TV manufacturers have when trying to reach the ever-growing gaming audience. Input lag is defined as the time it takes for an input given on a controller/device to be registered on the tv. In other words, input lag is how fast after you press the melee button that you actually see your character melee on your screen. This TV has some of this, but there are work around for it. It's actually important to know where this input lag comes from and what steps one can take for this tv.Consumers want the best picture quality, with the greatest clarity, sharpness, brightness, definition, and smoothness possible. People want to turn on their tv and be shocked off their chairs at how beautiful the coral reef is and how fast Sidney Crosby actually is at Hockey. In order to provide this, tv manufacturers have added crap loads of processing and enhancements to the tv. By doing this, they have been able to create almost life-like images and please the ever-quality hungry consumers. Is this good news or bad news for gamers?  IT'S BAD NEWS!!!!All of this added processing and enhancements hurt the gamer because this is extra \"work\" that needs to be done BEFORE the picture is displayed on the screen; and that \"work\" takes time - therein lies the Catch 22. Here's the breakdown: When viewing Blu-ray or watching tv, the tv is only concerned with displaying the picture. The tv plays by it's own rules and does not have to operate in real time. Hypothetically, say you start playing a movie at time 0 by pressing the play button. The movie starts displaying at time 2 seconds and goes on without a hitch. In that 2 seconds the tv does its processing/enhancements/conversions and the viewer feels like he's watching the tv in real time; but actually he's 2 seconds behind - but it doesn't matter. (The TV has a 2 second window to buffer data) In GAMING, the inputs are constantly changing and split second decisions are necessary for the win. For each button press on the controller, the processing starts all over since it's technically a new feed and the ensuing image must be processed. Add these button presses and the following processing and you get lag.CRTs (Cathode Ray Tubes - the old school tvs) did not have this problem since there wasn't any processing to be done. They simply displayed what was sent. I had a 32in RCA that I played on before I got the B750. This is what I'll use to make my comparisons.2ms Response Time:A very common misconception is that the the response time of 2ms takes care of this lag issue. This is simply not the case as response time is the time that it takes a crystal to go from black to white to black again. This does not aid lag at all but does aid in fast moving sports. I'll mention it here, but many people like Plasma tvs since they seem to have less input lag than LCDs and have great blacks (I haven't really noticed this to be true but the mass consensus leans differently). However, the Image Retention (IR) and threats of Burn In cause people to shy away from plasmas. How'd you like to have the outline of a HUD or status bar still be visible when you're watching tv?Out of the Box Lag:Right out of the box, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was completely unplayable. To illustrate, I would move to look and there would be a noticeable 1/2 second delay - Really sucks when you're trying to scope someone. Each move was accompanied by this delay.Lag Fixes - Game Mode:This is Samsung's solution to the processing problems associated with their LCDs. What it does is pretty much disables a lot of the internal processing as well as disabling some user settings that affect this processing. What's compromised (to my naked eye) is color vibrancy, motion control, and edge enhancements. Game Mode really does help the lag. I've noticed a definite improvement in zoomed in scoping adjustments. The only thing that I had to do is adjust the sensitivity in the game itself. Coming from a CRT with no lag, I can tell a difference (Very SLIGHT) between the CRT and the B750. I did however play several games and did very well, but noticed that something was \"off\". I found that game mode was not enabled - it was my sensitivity to lag that alerted me.Lag Fixes - PC RenameAnother, quite popular fix is to rename DVI/HDMI1 as PC. What people realized is that due to the VGA cable capabilities and nature of internet content, the processing had to be taken down some and other enhancements made because viewing text on the tv was hard and cumbersome. This fix is a \"middle of the road\" correction since it does not affect the true heart and cause of input lag. It does tend to keep color vitality though. When I tried this fix, I found that it was better than having Game Mode Off, but not better than Game Mode On from an Input Lag standpoint.Lag Fixes - Enhancements OffIn another attempt, I turned off the AMP (Auto Motion Plus), Dynamic Contrast, Edge Enhancements, and all other non-essential PQ (Picture Quality) adjustments. It was worse than PC rename but better than no adjustments. Picture quality was fine, but I'm not to care how much detail there is, just so that I can play to win.Lag Fixes - My Set-up and Component VS HDMIWhat I settled on was using HDMI from my Elite, turning off Enhancements, and putting Game Mode On. This seems to be the best for me and gives the greatest response. I did use component cables for a little bit. The reason being is that with component, the signal tends to send an over saturation of colors (Colors are really deep). This tended to fix the sub-prime PQ and restored some color vibrancy. I did end up replacing this with HDMI since I started to notice a bit of Lag. I've also read that HDMI tends to be faster than component. From reading the forums above, most people who have timed their system using Rock Band or Guitar Hero have reported input lag of around 30 to 35 milliseconds (some rare cases .65 milliseconds). That equates to .03 to .035 seconds. Not bad, but still not great - most people will not notice it.Other Comments and Reviews:The customer images of Megan Fox from Transformers 2 and the football game with Tom Brady are from my tv. Great Picture Quality and detail.Menus -Decently fast and animated. Takes a bit to get used to but you'll soon be whipping around the selections. One nice feature is that when you're making an adjustment, there's some text that shows up and explains/defines what you're adjusting - quite helpful.Energy Saver -Nothing ticks me off more than people saying something is \"green\" or \"eco-friendly\" and therefore a great buy. I have no qualms about being smart with the environment and being responsible with what I'm given - China's Industry regulations anyone? I do have a problem with compromising quality on the basis that it's better and greener and a must use. Case and Point - those energy saver light bulbs with the cylindrical curves. Samsung jumped on board the \"green\" wagon, misguided though it is, and came up with CE Dimming to earn the energy saver seal. In it's simplest form, CE Dimming darkens the screen when the screen is dark and darkens the screen when there's bright light on the screen. This is rather annoying especially since it's not timed right and you can notice it get darker. To turn it off:Turn the power off. On the remote, press Mute followed by 1, 8, 2, Power in sequence. The TV will turn on and you should now see the service menu. Down arrow to Advanced. Press 0000. Then down arrow (not right arrow!) until you get to CE Dimming. Hit Enter. Down arrow to Standard or Movie and right arrow to switch it off. Hit Power to exit the service menu.YOUR SETTINGS WILL BE RESET REGARDLESS IF YOU CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE SERVICE MENU OR NOT!DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE IN THE SERVICE MENU UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU'LL BRICK YOUR TV!Widgets:Pretty much these suck! Slow load times on multiple levels. Some say that firmware updates have fixed the load times; but others say that the FW updates have actually messed with their settings. Since Samsung does not post what the FW updates actually fix, it's impossible to know what you're actually updating. I wouldn't update unless you had to.Remote Control Infrared:The remote is a bit picky about where it's being pointed. It has to be pointed at the right bottom by the red light in order to be recognized. It's a bit of a problem if you're not used to it. The other thing is that if you have a Samsung Blu-ray player, you'll probably get interference like I did between the two of them.Movie Mode, Standard, Dynamic Modes:Most people use Movie Mode for their mode of choice since it tends to open up more picture options. I found that movie mode is a bit too dark (could be my set). Dynamic mode is what Best Buy uses to show how bright the set can be. It tends to be too vibrant and will no doubt shorten your backlight lifespan. I use Standard for my viewing. It's a good middle ground if you will and I feel that it provides a more natural feel than the other two. I am going to try some more settings in Movie Mode and see what I get - to be posted later.Closing:As I said in the beginning, Most people have already done a pretty good job of reviewing this. I just didn't find anything about gaming. Most of what I've written can also be applied to PS3 since from the forums that I've read, they seem to be similar. I do Play on Xbox Live a lot as well as in-game. Hope this helps people. At the time of writing this, I just watched the Steelers play the Ravens on NBC through the air.

UNREADABLE DOCUMENTATION.I received the LN52B750 Samsung LCD from Amazon 2 days ago.  Picture with Verizon FIOS and HDMI is beautiful.The 300+ page User's Manual is on a thumb drive that you plug into the LCD's USB port.  That's cool, that is smart I thought.  But then I attempted to read the Owner's Manual to identify the individual back panel connectors. The manual's English grammar and spelling is fine - but the important info is unreadable.Instead of using black text on a white background, Samsung uses tiny tiny white text (font size 6 or 4 I estimate) on a deep black background.  The diagrams are even worse - very tiny and undiscernable. The critical diagram info details used to identify the functions (lables, the text, the connectors, the thin pointing arrows, etc.) are white, blue, red, purple and brown (I think) on the same black background and are totally washed out and unreadable. (I called for help. But my grandkid's young eyes could not discern it either then quickly tired of it and resumed teasing each other.)Note that the detailed info you need about connections in the Owner's manual is visible (???) but not readable only on the screen when you are in FRONT of the screen.  But you are sitting on the floor BEHIND the set to make the connections.  Human engineering?I disconnected the thumb drive and attached it to my Macintosh and 22\" monitor.  Same readability problem. I copied and pasted some of the first pages into Word at a rate of about one Manual page per minute. I printed out a few pages on my good quality HP printer.  Being all black, very slow printing and still virtually unreadable. How much expensive toner is needed to print an (unreadable) 300 + black page manual?Maybe I should view the manual's diagram with the Thumb drive plugged into my Mac.  Hey, then I could use the Mac's Zoom view feature while I sit on the floor behind the set making connections to the various attachments.  Brilliant!So I called Samsung Customer Support (1-800-726-7864). They did not understand my problem.  But said maybe I could download a white background .pdf file of the User's Manual.  Or I could purchase for $13.00 a paper copy of the Owner's Manual with a White background, black text and readable diagram colors.So I went to [...] to order the manual.Sorry: there it told me the LN52B750 (or LN52B750UIM) is not a recognized Samsung product. Ditto on other Samsung support pages. There is a file for the LN52A750 but how relevant is it to the B model?By the way, the 52B750 Owner's Manual also lacks a Table of Contents, Index and Glossary.[...]Very sad.Ron Sander", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great PQ But a Few Issues", "Author": "T.

The picture quality (PQ) is stunning with rich dark blacks and vibrant colors. The number of manual setttings that you can use to dial in this set are far more than the normal person can comprehend.

Fortunately where I have it is a darker area of the house and recessed in an entertainment center. However if you place it in highly lit area you will get a substantial mirror effect.2) The biggest disappointment I have though with the set is the noticable clouding and flashlights on total dark screens and a slight bleed through on certain TV/blu ray scenes. Although I know clouding is a normal by-product of LCD's I did not think it would be that obvious on a high end LCD like this. I have only had the set 2 days and hope this will improve.

I had my heart set on the LN52a650 because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews that I read.  I was waiting to move into my new house to buy it, but I kept checking prices just to see if a really good deal came up.  Well, I waited long enough that the new line of TVs came out, including this one.  Long story short, when reading specs and reviews from another website, I decided to give this a look at my local big box store.  All I can say is this TV has the best picture I have ever seen.

I was fortunate enough to stumble on a great deal here on Amazon, and I could not be happier with the purchase.  A little warning- when this comes out of the box, it was set to \"dynamic\" for the picture settings, which causes a good deal of pixelation and jaggies.  A quick run through the menus brought the \"movie\" setting.  I turned this on and brought the sharpness way down, and this completely solved that little issue.All in all as I mentioned above, the picture quality on this set is unmatched from what I have seen.

After doing research for 15days I went to Fry's to buy LN52A750 last week with $2k budget in my mind. However the sales rep said many people returned that TV because of its very glossy screen and he recommended me to buy LN52630 instead because it has non-reflective (matte) screen.  A630 looked very dull when compared to A750 however the glossy screen of A750 was bugging me and was stopping me from buying that TV. Then my wife saw B750 which was kept very next to A750. I compared both for 30 min. B750 has glossy screen but not as glossy as A750. When asked sales rep said it has anti glare coating and it is a semi-glossy. Guess what that is exactly what I wanted. Also color looked very bright and crispy in B750 and so as clarity. No motion blurriness at all. I am not sure about the source of the signal but B750 looked better than A750 to me.  Even though B750 priced $600 more than A750 it has 2ms response time and 240HZ refresh rate and semi glossy screen. I did not think much thereafter.  Paid $2465 + tax + delivery = $2715. :(When we received the TV we did not have HD subscription. With SD signal our first impression was not that great. Channels looked normal and not exceptional for the price we paid. Some sports channels looked very blurry.  But I knew this TV is capable of producing amazing picture as I have seen this at showroom.  I called TimeWarner and got HD subscription very next day. Technician connected the HD box to the TV with standard cable. Even though HD looked very clear it still had ghosting effect when looked from very near. This worried me little bit. Cable technician suggested me to use the HD component for better quality signal. I decide to buy it next day. However my friend suggested me to use HDMI cable. My TW HD receiver did not have HDMI output. So I had that receiver exchanged for the one with HDMI output. Barrowed HDMI cable from my friend and connected to TV. Guess what? HDMI cable made all the difference. I could not be happier than that in my life. Oh my god. Picture quality was amazing. It was crystal clear. Ghosting effect was gone and I did not notice even slightest motion blurriness.  Some channels such as TBS, TNT, CBS, HGTV looked amazingly clear. I did not test this TV on Blue ray but I am pretty sure it would look great.  I connected TV to Internet and I am not very excited about this feature. It connects to Yahoo and we can access yahoo news, weather etc. These features are not very useful to me in any way. Sound quality looks ok to me. Remote is easy to operate and menus are easy to navigate. I keep auto motion option in standard mode and I did not find any difference when this feature is OFF.

Yang", "ReviewID": "R3MVNI6S0W6JFJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'll try my best to be fair with this review.  I think this set has its merits but too many flaws really bring it down.While in some ways, this TV is a step forward for Samsung's line of LCD TVs, it's a huge step backwards in other ways.  Compared to last year's LN52A750, the B750 has slightly better black levels, considerably less flashlighting/clouding, and a convenient swivel stand.  Overall, the picture boasts vibrant colors and incredible detail.  I was really blown away with the look of blu-ray movies at native 24p motion in full 1080p resolution.  Samsung really packed in a ton of features, bells, and whistles with this set.  I loved it for the first day I owned it, but I soon started noticing some troubling issues.What really ruins this set for me are three hugely important things: (1) poor motion processing (2) significant input lag and (3) poor viewing angles.  The sad thing is that I have a 32\" Samsung LCD from 2006 (LNS3251D) that outperforms the B750 in all of these aspects. I'll go into each in detail:(1) Motion ProcessingFor all of Samsung's boasting about the much-vaunted 240hz mode, I was surprised at how poorly this set handled motion. Perhaps it's all of the sophisticated image processing that's applied in modern LCDs.  But apart from native 24p sources, the B750 exhibited some bizarre motion artifacts.  Motion on this set would alternate between looking silky smooth (too much, to a fault) and being suddenly jerky and even seizing up for a split second.  It's a slightly subtle phenomenon to detect, but it leaves the viewing feeling dizzy.  Even with 240hz modes applied (I tried a large combination of de-judder and de-blur), the phenomenon continued to exist.While we're on the issue of 240hz, I'm personally not a believer in these modes and find them gimmicky.  While in 240hz mode, the set interpolates the motion between frames, which leads to artificially and unrealistically smooth motion, often referred to as the \"soap opera effect\".  This completely ruins the natural cadence of film and tv dramas, but can be helpful for watching sports.  It's merely a bandaid, in my opinion, as it never approaches the natural motion processing of plasma or CRT tvs.The only solution to the motion processing issue was to apply Game Mode, which inherently disables a lot of picture controls and reduces the amount of image processing.  I didn't find this to be an acceptable solution at all.  Sadly, here, my 3 year old LNS3251D doesn't exhibit these motion artifacts at all.  Last year's A750 also handles motion far better than the B750.(2) Input LagSamsung claims a 2ms response time with this set.  I find this hard to believe.  When watching blu-rays, I noticed a significant lag in the picture that led to lip-sync errors.  This is correctable either by using Game Mode or setting the audio lag on your a/v receiver.  When auto-calibrating video lag in Rock Band 2, the B750 measured about 130ms without Game Mode and 76ms with Game Mode.  By comparison, the LNS3251D (rated 8ms by Samsung) measured 36ms without Game Mode (I didn't bother trying Game Mode bc this was excellent performance).  It didn't suffer from any of the lip-sync error of the B750. What happened in the past three years?!(3) Viewing AnglesFinally, viewing angles are a serious problem for this set.  It has a very small sweet spot (eye-level and centered horizontally) in the middle of the couch where colors are brilliant, vibrant, and accurate.  I was really disappointed that even slightly off axis viewing led to significantly washed out colors.  I couldn't even sit on the side of my small couch without noticing the degraded image.  By comparison, the LNS3251D and last year's A750 are far better.  Again, I have no idea why the B750 is so poor.I think it's important for these issues to be brought to light.  Not everyone will be bothered by all of these issues.  It's even been suggested that I got a lemon (I sent this TV back to Amazon).  But I'm overall disturbed by the trend of unnecessary image processing in modern LCD TVs.  I ended up buying a Panasonic TCP54V10 to replace this TV and I couldn't be happier.  I never have to turn on any Game Mode, I can sit on the floor and the picture doesn't change, and motion looks natural and smooth.  I really wanted to love the B750.  It packs a lot of features.  But in the end, it didn't deliver on the most important one, being a solid television display.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best LCD picture I have seen", "Author": "Jason Miranda", "ReviewID": "R20T058FY1XF1I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this mid/late last week and it was delivered within aprox 3 business days. Amazon is so good about their deliveries. I purchased this to replace my Samsung LNT5265F TV which was unfortunately damaged in an accident. The Delivery folks came in and setup everything and even disposed of the trash which was awesome.The original TV was great and I have never had a problem with any Samsung product I have owned. I have two Samsung MP3 Players and a Samsung Electric Range/Oven in my home as well as the this new TV and the previous one. Samsung is a great company.Originally we were going to get one of Samsung's new LED LCD TV's but to be honest when we saw them in person I was put off by some of the clouding/lighting issues. In a few years I think they will be nice, but not yet. This TV is phenomenal. It has the best blacks and whites I have seen on a TV ever. It is a noticeable improvement over our previous model. It is very sharp and our PS3/Xbox 360/OTA TV looks great on it. The menu system is well designed and I was happy to see that the OTA channels now show what programming is coming next for a few hours similar to a TV guide. The inputs being on one side of the TV (the right hand side) is a nice change and made hook ups much easier. I also like the remote layout, though I wish there was a dedicated \"Guide\" button. Have not made use of the Network functions yet, but plan to soon. Samsung sells an adapter to connect via LAN that I need to get first. To be honest it would have been nice if they integrated that.TV sound is not good, but to be honest who doesn't hook this up to a sound system these days? It wasn't bad, it just wasn't something I would enjoy using day in, day out. It sounds very flat and one dimensional. Hook up your audio source to a nice surround sound via fiber optic cables though and you have a winning combo.Final note, I would highly recommend turning off the Automotion feature when playing games as it can produce some funky effects. The Automotion looks really nice on HD content such as OTA HD or Bluray but still can occasionally produce odd effects. An example, there were some artifacts on the face of characters with stubble and the helicopter blades in certain scenes of Transformers. These artifacts are much less frequent and smaller than the 120hz Automotion on other sets I have seen, but still there. Automotion is very much a preference feature anyways. I love it, but some people don't care for it.Anyways, I payed just over 2k for this at Amazon when it showed up in my quick picks along with a coupon.

I absolutely love all the features in this TV and the picture quality is amazing.But I would like to inform you all of one thing.This TV does not support Closed captioning on Component input and I think HDMI input too but i am not sure about HDMI as my cable box did not have hdmi output.When you call Samsung tech support, they would first try to tell you that it is the problem of the cable box, then when I explain it to them that captioning is enabled on the box, they would finally say that component inputs cannot support closed captioning or something like that. I have another Panasonic TV which does display the closed captioning when I connect the same source to its component inputs which proves that the cable box is outputting the CC info on the component outputs.After hours on the phone with Samsung tech support and a technician coming to my house, the only conclusion everybody comes to is that the TV does not support it on component inputs.Now i keep wondering that if we buy a $2500 TV, who would want to watch video on composite input. We would want to connect it to either component input or HDMI but by doing that we don't get the closed caption feature.Isnt it required by law that all TV manufacturers support CC on their TV. Maybe samsung is getting away with it because they can say that they do support it on composite input. But isnt that plain absurd because nobody is going to use the RF input or the AV input on a big screen TV with 1080p resolution. So basically what samsung is saying that either you get Closed captioning or u get good picture quality but not both.First samsung has to acknowledge that they have a problem before they can fix it. I am just struggling to get samsung to acknowledge this issue.Till then I will have to live without CC.", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Beast", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R37F026R2Z2BYO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the past 3 years, I have hemed and hawed over getting a large flat screen TV.  Each time I was about to go for one, a new model came out which I thought was so much better that I should just wait a bit more and get that new model once the price came down a little.At a certain point the quality got so good that the next model could not offer anything that to me would be worth waiting any longer for.  In store demos showed just how amazing this TV is and it in fact blew the competition out of the water.  The image was just so clear and detailed, its almost unbelievable!Amazon shipped this to us using Pilot.  Never used them before but they did a wonderful job.  Even came in the house, unloaded it out of the box, and took the trash away.  This was important to me since I got the free shipping, I wanted to make darn sure my investment was no damaged or roughed up.With a TV this size, normal TV viewing looks not so good to be honest.  When i first hooked it up I had expected cable to look better or at least as good as it did before.  We decided to add HDTV to our cable and now those channels look great.DVD's look good too.  Each is different but most we have played so far on our HDMI DVD player look wonderful.Blu-Ray... mouth dropping amazing on this TV.  Some movies look 3D they are so good.  The detail just blows me away each time.  I was never a big believer in blu ray to be honest but now that I have this TV and have seen the difference... I AM A BELIEVER!PS3/Games are great on here too.  We got it connected with an HDMI cable and oh man is it fun.  Killzone 2 in particular is a blast on this large TV.I do have a few cons.  The TV is not wireless so you have to either run a cable for the internet or get a part for it to connect to a wireless router.  Not a huge deal but is an issue for me.Outside of running basic cable into your TV from the wall, closed captioning and picture in picture do not work.  They work on the normal TV channel but if you go to HDTV both do not work.  The CC does work if you have a normal box, just not an HD box.  Even when watching a DVD if I want to turn on the CC from the DVD, the TV shows it in freaking huge print and cuts half of it off.  We tried adjusting the screen size to no avail.  I have a hearing loss so closed captioning is very important to me.  I am hopefull for a software update to fix this but wont hold my breath.The picture in picture is odd as well.  It seems they only made it for the base TV with having no 'cable box' at all.  So if you have cable, the picture in picture will never work for you since you.Everything else we love about this TV.  Just flat out amazing but those few items keep us from giving the full 5 stars.Update: 9/15/2009About a month ago the HDMI ports started to go out.  Only HDMI 3 worked and the rest were dead.  Samsung was quick to send a part and get a local tech to install it.  It worked for about 2 weeks.  Same issue all over again now.  It has been 2 weeks since I contacted Samsung and I have heard nothing back from them since.  I will be following up with them today and update this review again once we have a resolution.Update: 10/17/2009It took over a month from when I requested this 2nd fix to when they finally came and fixed it.  Apparently there was an issue with this models board that caused the HDMI ports to break easily according to our repair man.

Plasma has its applications, but it did not match my preferences for a home setup. LEDs, I loved the thin aspects, but a review (see link at end) plus the higher LED model cost led me to the conclusion LCD is good-enought. And for this time-around LCD was my cost choice until the LEDs are in production longer, price competitive, quality proven, etc. So then it was down to \"which brands and features\"? For me, I wanted reliability and quality. I was also interested in internet features, USB capabilities, and 4 HDMI hook-up. I looked very hard at LG, Samsung, and Sony. I eventually narrowed it to Samsung and Sony. Both had reviews that were positive and negative. I was a little concerned when I read some negatives about Samsung having issues. I Googled this concern and indeed found several hits. I thought about it for a minute, then changed Samsung to Sony and found the same type problem. So I did not trust either to be perfect, so I bought a warranty recommended by Amazon and this outfit named SquareTrade got fairly good reviews (you can Google or chk on Amazon for reviews about this warranty company). In the end, I picked the Samsung. This one is a beautiful TV, and I love the convenient USB port where we can view pictures, videos, essentially anything you can store on a memory stick; that's cool! I've also played some with the internet features, like Yahoo Finance and Youtube - sure wish this TV could work with a keyboard... Anyhow the TV quality is so cool, but I'm moving from a 35\" tube to this new unit; it's like coming out of a cave!Again, it was a hard choice between the the Samsung and the Sony, but I'm very happy with the Samsung LCD. I think the one thing people need to watch carefully is the HDMI cable cost, which I think is over-inflated. I ended up ensuring the spec said 1080p, and I the picture is nothing short of great. I did not get hung up on the packaging that said one cable was rated for 120 or 240Hz, as I don't think your eyes could tell the diff. I wanted right away, or I would have ordered from internet, like from Mediabridge. You might find this surprising, but I found my cables at Home Depot (really!), again the focus was 1080p compatibility. I got 15' for $35. Also bought a 4230 joules surge protector at Lowes, the more joules, the better nothing that I could find in documentation about a minimum necessary amount of joules to buy, just plan to spend a few dollars to protect from surges. The TV, warranty, and one of the HDMI cables I was not in a hurry for, I bought via Amazon without issue. I hooked up a surround sound to bring in the best sound through my DVR (DISH), and all is good. Hope this helps someone out there with questions like I had.Interesting LED review that shaped my decision + cost reasons...http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NX2Q9NZ1TKJU/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R1NX2Q9NZ1TKJU[...]", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good TV, mostly good features", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R3J4NEID1SRVM7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using this TV for just over a month.

Even web browsing would have been very nice.The TV requires a proprietary wireless adapter if you want to connect the PC to your wireless router.  The good news is the adapter is 802.11 n/g/b.  The bad news, Samsung requires you to use their overpriced adapter.  I received mine at no charge as a rebate, and if I did not, I would not have been happy due to the limited features available via the adapter.A nice to have would be much stronger parental controls (limiting the time that each child could use the TV, and having them login to see the TV).Summary: The TV picture is excellent, remote and sound are just okay, internet features need much improvement.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome Picture - I'm happy!", "Author": "Aaron Dahl", "ReviewID": "RR27UPIVP5HOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I was happy with my 30\" Philips HDTV, it was simply too small for my 30'x30' living area, and the new flat screens available offer the size and the quality picture I wanted. You cannot buy a television based on written reviews alone, so I visited a couple local retailers. In the stores the pictures that really stood out as crystal clear with dark blacks, and good definition were the Samsungs (Panasonic was probably my second pick). I was really blown away with their new LED televisions - they are simply amazing, but my budget of $2k did not permit a large enough LED. For my budget I narrowed it down to a 58\" plasma or this 52\" LCD. After a little online research, I decided to go with the LCD primarily because of the plasmas tendancy still to burn in and I intend to use the television as a computer monitor sometimes and view photos, online content, etc.The television came well packaged, and very easy to get out of the box and on the wall (with the additional wall mount I purchased). Plenty of HDMI inputs allow the setup to be a breeze plug one into the DVD, one into the cable box, another into the receiver, and I still have one spare! BTW - you'll want to exchange that old cable box if you've only got the high def component out on it, took my old one over to Time Warner and they exchanged it with no questions. The right setup is with the HDMI out on the cable box and the category 2 HDMI cables (order these from Amazon too, they are $10 on Amazon and $60 at your local Best Buy).The internal setup part was pretty straight forward, I didn't have to break out the directions to get the television working properly and the out-of-the-box settings result in a crystal clear picture. I am as pleased with this in my living room as I was impressed in the store. When I finally got around to pulling out the instructions, and setting up the internet connection, then I discovered how easy it was to access music, photos, and videos from my laptop - with a couple clicks I was viewing a slideshow of my last vacation on this huge screen with no more hardware than a router and my laptop streamed over my home network.I have had the television now for a couple weeks and am very happy with my purchase.

It has no visible speakers, chins, \"touch of blood color\", see-thru windows, power lights,  barnacles, gold trim, fur, or any of that sillyness. Though I was initially disappointed to see it had a grinning \"light effect\" at the bottom, but luckily that was easy to turn off. The tv looks beautiful and minimalist even before you turn it on, so this is one that will continue to look good for a long time. Having looked at many, my opinion is that this is the best looking TV you can buy right now.Once you turn it on the picture quality is quite good. In our case it replaced a Sony s2000 40-inch, and the picture quality is as good and better in some areas. Viewing angle is not quite as good as the Sony, though not bad. Blacks are noticeably blacker than the Sony, or any other LCD I've seen for that matter. In a room with lights on, the blacks look as dark as the black border around the TV. In a room with no lights on, the blacks are slightly lighter (depending on your settings). I was glad to see a near complete absence of any clouding or flashlighting. On a pure white background screen, there is some slight vignetting in one corner, though not visible in normal use.One thing that does differentiate it is the 240hz blur and judder reduction. This is great for tickers on news channels, and for sports, but makes everything else look like BBC kids shows, which is to say kind of bizarre and hard to watch. We won't be using this feature except when we want people to leave. Though it is acceptable with blur reduction sans judder reduction. But if motion blur is a big issue for you then you should probably be looking at a different HDTV technology rather than put up with these strange looking solutions. In my case, I'm so used to the inherent LCD motion blur that I my eyes are used to it, even preferring it. We are very happy with the tv and would purchase again, though think the price is still a bit high, even with the discount.

As Amazon is an authorized distributor, their price is limited to the $2,465 that all other authorized distributors are priced at.  Many other etailers sell around $2,090 but are not authorized, so I was very wary of them.Then Amazon comes along with a $400 promotional discount (unfortunately expired on 6/1) and basically unadvertised on their site.  I found it through bloggers.  So I was able to buy at a price matched to the other guys.Delivery estimate was 6/4 for me, but I got a call saying it was ready for delivery on 6/1.

Some of its intentionally built-in limitations just amazed me, but I find that is somewhat true of all electronics, so I didn't degrade my star rating any.The most bizarre case, the 5.1 channel sound is only available if the source is the built-in tuner.  Any source sound from HDMI inputs (such as a BD Player) is downgraded to 2 channel for passing through to the HDMI output.  Per the user manual, the only way to get 5.1 sound from all your devices is to have them each send their audio via optical straight to the audio receiver.  This just defeats the whole advantage of HDMI doing combined audio/video in one cable.Design wise, this should be a simple HDMI pass-through.  I am always amazed when companies spend manpower to delete naturally occurring functionality, especially when that deletion make otherwise great features useless.  Four HDMI inputs yet you can't use them because surround sound is stripped.  Is this a case of the consumer getting screwed by movie industry driven DRM (in the guise of HDCP) once again?I am hoping this is a simple Korean/English Technical Writer translation error.

By and large it's far and away the best picture I've seen on a television.The only complaint about the set are, first and foremost, the picture at times can look a little artificial if you have the 240htz working. The way we handle it is when watching a sporting event or live television we keep the set to smooth or one of the other settings. If we watch a movie or TV show we turn it off. The only other complaint I have, is the pedestal, the set is mounted to. Not very stable. And as a solution Samsung sent along an anchor to screw to the wall and attach a chord to.On the whole though the picture as I said before is so sharp and clear you can be at times, speechless. I adjusted some settings about a month after I bought it with my video essential dvd. Out of the box it didn't need much adjustment. Big differance from the Mits it replaced.Got a good price from Amazon, less than what it's going for now. Shipping was hassle free, and took less time than originally predicted. However some reviews I've read have said the shipper will set it up, not the case for us. no big deal, My wife stayed home that day and waited for the set, when it arrived the driver brought it in, took it out of the box and put it on the pedistal. I hooked it up. Once again no Biggie. I hooked it up with one hdmi cable from my Denon AVR3806 receiver, works like a charm. The reason I gave the name and model of my AV receiver is, one of the earlier reveiwers had problems with his Denon receiver.

They'll work perfectly fine if you attach a computer as one of the components.  I don't know why more people don't do this:  they're cheaper (currently) than a conventional computer monitor, and believe me, once you get used to it, you'll never go back to 19\".  As for the Samsungs in particular, the \"auto-adjust\" feature really does work, and there is no residual fuzziness or unwanted screen crop -- although you'd better have a state-of-the art video card on your computer for this to render the crisp picture you're dreaming of.  The one that comes on a garden-variety laptop will never do.  This is something I was unclear on at first.  When I brought my first one home, I eagerly hooked it up to my computer, awaiting the ultimate 40\" video gaming experience.  To my dismay, the picture lacked fine resolution, making the experience very unsatisfying.  I tried everything:  changing the settings on my video cards, exhaustively combing the Samsung's menus, replacing all relevant cables with top-of-the-line brand-name cables, and more.  It was only after everything failed that I realized this wasn't a shortcoming with Samsung's hardware at all.  It was because my computer's video card, while fine for a 19\" conventional computer monitor, was inadequate to the task of projecting on to something that was 40\" and still maintaining that fine, crystal clear definition that you demand.  It seemed like everybody understood this but me.  Anyhow, if you're planning on using one of these for your computer, make sure that you have the best video card you can buy.  If you've got dreams of hooking your computer up to one of Samsung's 52\" jobs, I think you can forget about that for now:  as of this writing I don't think they make a video card good enough to do that, but give them time.  If this is your ultimate goal but you cannot wait for this development, I would suggest you simply buy a video projector for your computer, which, provided you have a suitable white wall, will give you that crisp picture you're drooling for at a fraction of the price -- plus with these projectors you can make your image a lot bigger than just 52 inches!I use one of these for my computer at work (40 inches:  I'm insane), and another, slightly smaller one for my home computer.  As I say, they work EXTREMELY well for this purpose, which is why I have three of them total:  I'm too leery to switch brands.  For example, the TV, when you use it as a computer monitor, has enough brains to shut down when your computer goes to sleep, and then to fire back up again when your computer wakes up -- all without your having to touch the monitor at all!2.  If used as a TV, this set can evidently do a lot.  Tragically, this will require you to get educated about the latest cables and connectors.  For example, I am wont to connect all my devices (Playstations, cable connections, VHS players, DVD players, Blue-ray players, satellite links, etc.) with red-white-yellow connectors, or, preferably, red-white-red-green-blue connectors.  As for the latter, this only has two rows available, plus an extra red-white-yellow on the TV's left side (facing the screen).  However, it has an array of other adapters (such as HDMI adapters) that I'm still learning about.  (These basically look like jumbo-sized USB cables, but can carry high definition sound and audio together in one cable).  If you're unclear on the in's and out's of this stuff, read the exchange in the comments below, which I found helpful.  I have never, for example, learned how to get the monitor's on-board speakers to route the sound the computer's putting out.I do have a couple of complaints, though:1.  It is my opinion that the on-board speakers are weak.  This isn't much of a problem if you're using this as a computer monitor, since the screen is right in front of you (the speakers are on the bottom, under the screen), but if you plan on using this as your main TV, I think you're going to be disappointed.  I think the technology could be a lot better, but I think the reason they do that is to sell you one of these:  Samsung HT-TX75 DVD Home Theater System.2.  Screen burn is still possible, I'm here to say.  I would have thought manufacturers of TVs these days would have found a way to design their products so that this is no longer a danger, but not so.  The one in my living room still displays the ghostly word \"Phillips\" visibly whenever the screen goes dark on account of the night I left the DVD player on.

After I finally paired it up with a PS3 for playing Blu-Ray movies, I was even more impressed. According to CNet, the b750 series of Samsung tvs outperforms the edge-lit LED tvs (you know, the really thin ones). This is the absolute top of Samsung's 2009 line, and in my opinion, the best TV currently on the market. The blacks are black, the colors are accurate, the contrast is huge, and the clarity is unmatched. Speakers are okay, but lacking bass, as expected. Mine is plugged into 5.1 surround sound.That said, there was one small issue with the TV. When I got it, only my HDMI-1 was working. If I plugged something into HDMI-2,3, or 4, those inputs would appear in the Source switcher screen, but if I switched to them, the device on HDMI-1 would still display. I didn't notice for a few weeks, though, because I only had one HDMI source. However, Samsung's customer service kept their score at 5 stars.I called 1-800-SAMSUNG and was on hold for about 2 minutes. Then I told the customer service girl about my TV's issue. She typed up everything I said and told me she put a repair ticket in for me. Within the next two days, I was to receive a phone call from the closest Samsung-authorized repair center. Total elapsed time, about 10 minutes. I didn't wait two days for the next call, though. Within 20 minutes, I was on the phone with the repair center. I clarified my problem to the repair guy and he promptly ordered me a new input board. Again, less than 10 minutes on the phone. Now, I would have to wait a couple days for the part to arrive at the repair center. Two days later, the repairman was ready to come fix my TV (which still worked great, other than the inputs). He came over exactly at the time we agreed upon and was gone within a half-hour. I called Sunday, I think. He was ready to fix the TV on Wednesday.Three full days for an in-home repair requiring a shipped part. They earned their 5 stars here.By the way, check out CNet for their most accurate picture settings. Then watch a Blu-Ray you've already seen on the TV.

Many people have been experiencing problems with their TV that is directly related to blown capacitors due to a poor design of the power supply, which sit right next to the heat sinks. Typically, these capacitors fail between 11-18 months (depending on usage).Common symptoms of blown capacitors are:1. Long TV start time. Usually preceded by clicking sounds ( multiple attempts by the relay to start the TV)2. Picture problems. Hazy picture, lines, or no picture at all.3. TV fails to start at all.CNET.com has a thread on the subject. Search:\"Samsung ON OFF Issue\"There is also a tutorial on how to fix this issue if your TV is out of warranty. Search YouTube:\"Samsung TV Repair\"TV REVIEWPros-  That being said, I loved my Samsung LN52B750 for the 2 days that it worked. Bold, rich colors and very deep blacks; which are the best I had seen in a TV without a local-dimming backlight. It had a whole slue of color and picture adjustments, including separate judder and blur adjustment. The 240hz works great, if you like that sort of thing (I like STANDARD for motor-sports and OFF for everything else). Lots of connectivity and a beautiful design. It was everything I wanted in a TV after more than a month of research.Cons-  Unfortunately the TV only lasted 2 days. I'm not sure if it was the capacitors that blew, or if it was just a lemon. I would turn on the TV and get no picture. On a second start I would get a weird haze on the screen; like its pulsing light through the LCD panel but the video information isn't there (I posted a photo in the customer gallery up top).  I decided just to return it back to Amazon instead of trying to get it fixed under warranty; since Samsung isn't known for their customer service. Amazon has been very accommodating and is issuing a full refund (minus $53 shipping). The only complaint I have is that the widgets are slow and somewhat worthless. I loaded up the default widgets and experienced excessively long loading times even though I'm on a 25/25 FiOS connection. I'm sure people like them, and if I looked into it more I might find some real use for them, but they're just not for me.So, I'm going to give this TV another shot and hope the first one was just a lemon. This particular model isn't known for blown capacitors (however the A750 series is), so I will deal with it when and if that issue arises.

Haverlock", "ReviewID": "RVFNK9ALI6XZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to start off by saying that I am probably THE pickiest person when it comes to picture quality, response time, and input lag.  I started searching for a nice, large LCD a long time ago.  I finally decided to buy a 52 inch Samsung model 2 years ago but just the 60hz model with an 8ms response time from Amazon.  First of all, that LCD was basically unusable, came with some stuck pixels, and was plagued with ghosting.  I'd say that the response time was somewhere in the 200-400ms range for some high contrast colors.  There was also terrible pillaring on either side of the LCD that I could not ignore in scenes with lots of solid color.  I basically gave up the search at that point and returned the TV because I was so unhappy with it.So naturally, I was skeptical about this one when I needed to buy a TV for my new home 1.5 years later.  This time it was on my gf's dime, and I figured I'd give it a shot.  Let me tell you, the response time is about 100 times better.  I don't see blacks streaking across my screen like I used to.  Granted, since I am very sensitive to it, I can still see ever so slight ghosting if I look close enough.  But, the difference here is I have to try HARD to see it.  I still have slight pillaring on this LCD but it's almost nonexistent if you are directly in front of the TV.  Also, I have no stuck pixels which makes me happy too!  Input lag will exist on any large LCD you purchase, but I tell you I don't even notice it playing COD4 or Killzone2.  Contrast ratio and color tone has also advanced greatly since the last LCD I purchased.  They are so vivid and it is to bright that I have to turn it down to 1-3 for the backlight or else my eyes burn in the dark.  This LCD is also thinner than the last by about 50%.  I don't care for the 240hz because it makes mistakes with compressed content, but looks pretty damn good on uncompressed HD.  So, I leave judder and blur reduction to a nice median 5 and it's quite pleasing to look at now.  The menu, added features, and everything are also nice on this product, although I don't use them that often.  My ONLY complaint is that the speakers on this aren't up to par with the old one I returned.  Of course, this is 50% thinner so I am sure they downsized the sub and some speakers.  I can't rate this lower because you need to have a separate sound system anyways if you care to have good sound quality.  I got this for $1949 which is a hell of a lot cheaper than in the stores.  Coming from a picky user that frequented the avsforums and did a ton of research, you should definitely purchase this LCD.  At the time of this review and my purchase which was months ago, it was regarded as the best LCD on the market.

I debated over the LCD and Plasma for two reasons: 1) we have lots of windows in our living room and could have reflective glare and 2) we have a large living room with seating in places that could offer a bad viewing angle.  I decided on the LCD to reduce the glare and not worry so much about the viewing angle.

My 2 cents is that you should buy this television for the picture, not the Internet and networking extras.  The picture is why it gets a 5 star review - it will blow you and your friends away!  Just note the following about its connectivity: * Anything plugged into USB works flawlessly.  I have watched HD and SD movies over USB with no problems.  If you have a USB drive that can serve as your media (video/audio/picture) storage, you are set!  Audio files and pictures are great off USB, too!  I've tested digital cameras, iPods, and USB sticks successfully. * The included media server software works just OK.  (Install the software on your computer, and it lets you access the movies, music, and pictures from your PC over your home network.)  Sometimes, though, you'll skip out of a movie and on to the next film on the server with no warning!  Biggest gripe: when playing a move off of my PC using their media server software, you can't fast forward, rewind, or continue viewing from the last position! Read that last sentence a few times and tell me what Samsung was smoking when they shipped a media server without those features!  Note that all the missing features are present if you are watching films off of a USB drive. * The Internet@TV connectivity of this television just plain sucks - for now.  There are so few Yahoo widgets out there now that it is worthless until the promised/hinted at future widgets (YouTube, Netflix) come out.All this to say I am REALLY happy with the TV.  It is a fantastic viewing experience that overshadows all shortcomings.  Just don't buy it for the Internet@TV stuff!  I would have given it 4.5 stars if I could have.(Aside for the geeks: I have watched films in MKV, AVI, VOB, and MPG containers with H.264, Divx, and other MPEG codecs.  The TV decodes them natively, though you will want to encode your movies in the proper aspect ratio.  The TV cannot correctly interpret anamorphic encodings - e.g., if the video is in 16:9, encode it in something like 1600x900 pixels, or the TV will distort it in spite of your anamorphic settings.)", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it, except the documentation", "Author": "Jane Wade", "ReviewID": "R1DZ0BMXFVE96J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's awesome.Just 2 things to complain about.First, it gives off some weird radiation that disables my remotes when the screen is black and the set it on, or when the set is first turned on.

This one has neither. Also, the sound was horrendously tinny and muffled. This one is not a replacement for a home theater sound system, but it is at least understandable and good enough for casual daytime watching.The inky blacks are becoming legendary. You should look up the CNET review, which puts the picture on this set at the top of all fluorescent-light LCD televisions they ever tested. It also has low power consumption, so it is more \"green\" than most other comparable products.Many do not like or do not mention the features. Having Flickr access is really fun and opens a new world of content without watching TV. Yahoo videos are a little dated but many are interesting.

Take the fact that the Samsung was $400 cheaper, and it became a no-brainer.The picture is, without a doubt, the best I have ever seen.  Out of the box, the picture is pretty good, but when you play with the settings and tailor it to your specific viewing circumstances, you'll be seriously rewarded with an amazing picture.  The separation of dejudder and motion blur is a great feature as well, for those who want a fine mix of the two.  If I could, I would give the picture a 6/5.Connectivity is great, with 4 HDMI inputs and 2 USB inputs.  The side panel houses the 2 USB inputs and 1 of the HDMI inputs, but it is recessed enough to keep things plugged in without exposing the wires.  I have only viewed pictures on the screen, so I cannot adequately assess the ease of playing music/movies off external drives.  Yahoo widgets are painfully slow to start and run, so much so that they are basically useless.  Samsung also throws a few internet extras in as well that you can either take or leave.  4/5 in that category, although I suspect the widgets are as much Yahoo's fault as Samsung's (and to be fair, they were equally slow on the Sony).Now comes the poor part of the review.  I have this TV hanging on a wall, and I used a right-angle HDMI connector so I didn't have to smash my HDMI cable against the wall.  One day, it simply stopped working, and when I removed the TV from the wall, the connector seemed to have melted a bit, which was worrysome.  A few days later, a random buzzing would occur when I turned the TV on, and abruptly stop when the picture came on.  Finally, a week and a half ago, the TV would turn on and completely stop responding to anything - bright spots/lines would appear on the screen, and I was unable to access the menu, change inputs, or anything else.  A tech came to my house and replaced the timing board, which corrected the problem immediately.  However, he also said he would have to come back and replace the power board, because the buzzing indicated that it may die soon.I understand that every now and then, a lemon is had.  However, of the 4 major parts of the TV (panel, timing, power, inputs), 2 have had to be replaced already, so I'm basically stuck with a 45 day old refurbished TV (all of the problems coincidentally came just after the 30-day return window).  I intend on keeping it, as (hopefully) the power board will be fixed and everything will work like new, because the picture is absolutely sublime.  What happens in a year, when I'm out of my warranty?  I shudder to think of the stories that Samsungs fail to turn on correctly about 18 months after use.  I know that all brands have their deficiencies, and I also know that I was one of the unlucky ones to get a lemon (although, it is being fixed, so I can't be too picky).  However, I'm fairly certain that this will be my last Samsung product.On the bright side, while Samsung's customer service won't be winning any awards anytime soon, they were relatively helpful (maybe it's because I've heard all of the horror stories) and not completely incompetent.

True, it looks like you could reach into the TV and touch the people as evidenced by my viewing of Lost last night. I was blown away. However, the draw back is that there can be some blur/lag when characters move quickly or the camera pan changes.  Its not a deal breaker to me by any means.  In fact, you can just turn off the 240 scan and the picture is still beautiful.  Playing COD Modern Warfare 2 on my PS3 is unbelievable.  Blu-Ray movies are incredible.  For it's size, it really doesn't take up much more room than my previous 40\" LCD.  I haven't dug into the internet features too much.  Blockbuster on-demand looks interesting, but I can't really comment on this yet.  Bottom line for me is that this is a fantastic set for the price ($1699) and throwing in the Sammy BD player was icing on the cake.  I should mention that I ordered on Tuesday 2:30 EST and the TV was delivered by Pilot Freight on Friday at noon EST.

Unbelievably sharp picture and Samsung's colors are fantastic right out of the box.At first, things were a bit too sharp, though, and I was feeling somewhat unable to enjoy shows and movies because the HD was allowing me to see the layers of stage makeup caked on actors' and actresses' faces (which kind of takes you out of the scene)and the movement was too sharp (if that makes) sense. This was easily remedied by turning off the edge enhancement feature, reducing the judder to 3, and doing the other tweaks suggested by the top review listed here.My wife was skeptical about the value of this but now is completely sold and loves our TV.The Yahoo Widgets are kind of \"meh.\" right now, but the YouTube widget is nice and very easy to use. If Netflix Instant Streaming were built in, this thing would be off the hook, but that's okay; I've got a TiVo HD hooked up to it and that allows me to stream and download HD shows from Amazon and Netflix (Update: Looks like they've added Amazon On Demand to the available widgets!).In order to partially justify spending all this dough, I've dropped cable and am going purely with an HD antenna. (After testing out a bunch of models from cheap to expensive, I ultimately settled on the RCA flat amplified antenna with a powered amplifier.) I'm smack dab in the middle of NY, so I'm more than satisfied with the channels I get, and let me tell you, the picture from our local over-the-antenna broadcasts is amazing on this set. When we watch the news, it's a bit unsettling because it looks almost like the the newscasters are sitting across a table from us. And frankly, I'm glad not to have to deal with those bozos from the cable company anymore for anything but my internet bill.Some of the reviewers knock this TV for it's sound, but it's not bad...and really, when you're getting a TV in this class, why would you even consider doing anything less than a full home theater surround sound system?You'll probably rarely use it, but this unit has some nifty little software extras that are nice to turn on when you want to relax (there are nature and meditation programs you can turn that give you a pretty image (a la \"Sunrise Earth\") with some soothing music).The overall design is excellent. We love the clear stand and the rounded glass edges. When friends come over, they regularly comment both on the size (\"Whoa!\") and the how much they like it aesthetically.My only small complaint is that the glass screen is highly reflective. A BB salesperson told me that the glass screen is how Samsung manages to achieve the incredibly deep blacks on this TV, so I'm okay with it (and it's easy to just turn off the lights and close the shades...and wear dark clothing).Anyway, no regrets here at all.

Choi", "ReviewID": "R1ALG0ORVEJW78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As is the case with numerous other reviewers, I spent several months reading popular reviews and discussions on different types of LCDs and Plasmas. (Thanks to all the reviewers for the time you spent providing these reviews, by the way. And, boy, they can really shape your expectations.) I was about to get a mid-end plasma along with a PS3, but the spouse didn't want to see the family wasting our time on video games, so I settled on this \"high-end\" model.The first shipment arrived, and the delivery guy kindly noted the damages to the box. So, I decided to refuse the delivery. When the second delivery appointment call came in about 10 days later on a Friday, I decided that I couldn't wait until Monday, and asked if I could pick it up myself instead. When I got to the deliverer's, I was surprised to see how large the box was, but it fit in nicely in my SUV, with the 2nd and 3rd row seats flat, of course. (To set it up, though, I had to ask my neighbor for some help. There is definitely a good reason why they deliver and set up these TVs for you at your home.)Since I do not own a Blueray DVD player yet, I decided to connect the TV to my computer and use it as a second monitor as well. (My first one is a 24\" Samsung 244T.) Using an HDMI to DVI connector purchased from Amazon at around five bucks, the screen transferred pretty well from my ATI All-in-Wonder 1800XL to my new LN52B750. I could adjust the screen resolution to 1920 x 1080 at 60Hz (optimal as suggested in the manual--oh, the manual was a physical book, BTW; build date--June 2009--confirmed while registering), and I couldn't sense any flickering at pretty much any resolution it gave me. I've seen plenty of plasma screens that exhibited flickering on computer hookups, and so I was very satisfied with this. The fonts beneath the icons seem a tiny bit fuzzy at a close distance but readable. The fonts when web-browsing or reading word documents are fine, though. The picture quality is excellent for still pictures and videos. I watched several standard definition DVDs with the ATI DVD player (software), and the picture quality is fabulous. I have the audio hooked up from the optical out (from an Intel motherboard) to a Logitech Z5500, which has a decoder embedded. Set up this way, the audio does seem to lag just a little bit, but not enough to ruin the movie. I'm hoping that the audio through a Blueray DVD player will get rid of this issue. (Or perhaps if I connect the audio from the computer to the TV and then connect an optical cable from the TV to the speakers... but I haven't tested this yet.) Watching YouTube through the computer is fine, depending on the picture quality. The HQ or HD videos are very nice.I also wanted to see how computer games looked like (sorry I only have old ones). Playing Need for Speed Most Wanted really gives you a realistic experience. I also tried Star Wars Battlefront II, and the screen was cool, but I did feel a slight input lag, as one reviewer noted. So unless you play games that require extreme reflex (e.g., Combat Arms), I think it should be fine.Since I have my TV hooked up to my router with a CAT-5 networking cable, I also tried out the Internet TV features. As other reviewers noted, the load time is dead slow. It's like having to wait for an old OS9 machine or an old Windows machine with only 128mb of RAM to boot up. It's nice that all the information will show up right on top of whatever you're viewing and won't change any channel or input settings. I only tried the weather and the YouTube widgets or whatever you call them. The interface looks really nice, but I agree with the other reviewers that those features are just too slow to actually use them for practical purposes. Perhaps, if you had these widgets on all day, it would be fine. The YouTube videos are fine as well. You can search for videos or choose to watch the featured/popular ones. Again there is a bit of a delay in the search results.There's also some multimedia content embedded on a USB drive, I guess. They do have some relaxing pictures with music to enjoy. Some content such as art gallery, pictures (various categories), recipes, children's stories, and etc., are downloadable, but the existing memory had just enough space to download one extra category. I think if I attach a USB drive, there should be enough space to get all the free content that I'd want.The latest accessory I added was a Phillips rabbit ear HD antenna that's about nine dollars. The HD-supported channels look excellent while others are not that nice. Mileage will vary on the aired channels for sure.By the way, since I'm using the TV at such a close distance, I have the screen mode set to Movie and also have the energy saving set to low. I have not messed around with any other setting, and I find this to be comfortable for me. When I do watch movies at a distance, I sometimes turn the energy saving settings to off.I think I'll end my review here and provide updates at a later time. Thank you to all the previous reviewers and thanks for taking the time to read mine. If you're reading this, Samsung, please consider providing a firmware update to speed up the Internet TV feature. Thank you!* * * * Edit after 7 months of use * * * *Since my purchase of this LCD television, I got myself a computer-based bluray player and watched many titles, and all I can say is \"crystal clear\". Now that I have PS3, I don't have to turn on my computer to enjoy movies, and there is virtually no audio lag. Even the few games that I play are super amazing as well when you look at the graphics displayed on the screen. I hope that the price of these bluray movies can go down at some point. By the way, using a rabbit ear antenna, I enjoyed watching the Winter Olympics in full HD. That was a nice treat as well. Samsung has also added several firmware updates since then, and I'm satisfied so far as to how the TV performs.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Why look further", "Author": "K.

I bought the LN52B750 52 INCH 1080P 240HZ grey touch off of Amazon wholesale as an \"out of box\" and saved an additional $300. The TV easily installed and was a snap to set up. If your looking for a TV and can't decide \"plasma or LCD\" this is the one for you. I wanted the explosive colors of a plasma but wanted more stability and energy efficiency with a LCD. The LN52B750 delivers all of that as you can adjust the picture with various settings such as \"natural\" and \"movie\" so that you lose the associated brightness often found in LCD'S.  I set my on \"natural\" for most TV watching since it looks most natural for everyday viewing. XBOX, Cox cable and DVD all look stunning via HDMI cables. (sidenote: i do not see significant gain by going HDMI vs component; the HDMI just saves you from running sound and picture cords)HDMI: Don't waist your money on Monster at Best Buy. Goto Monoprice or check Cnet for other vendors for much less cost HDMI cables. I bought 25 ft cables for $26 each. Same thing for Monster is like $50-75 and a waist of additional money for no upgrade in picture.  In reading , component vs HDMI you will discover no significant picture upgrade. By cables accordingly to your liking. The only benefit of HDMI is one cable houses sound and picture cables.  If you dont' plan to use your TV for sound then you don't need HDMI.Sound: the LN52B750 has sound but not strong sound. I did not buy this TV for it's ability to generate surround sound or deep thundering base. It gets it done for every day TV but if you want movie or music deep sounds run your sound via a amplifier and separate system.COLOR: My wife did not want a contrasting \"red touch of color\" which does not go with most fireplace wood tones. In fact it clashes so she wanted a more neutral tone such as black. The Grey Touch of Color looks really great on the wall and blends in with our decor.SPEED: I see no significant gain 120hz vs 240hz for LCS. Plasma's run on average 600-800hz in comparison.In summary: I weighed Samsung versus Sony which are the top lines in LCD and Plasma (the best Plasma Pioneer Elite $3000+ ) on the market today. I also weighed LED new technology but all your buying is a thinner and more energy efficient TV with the price nearly 30% to 50% more and not worth the money.  The Sony will give you slightly more blacks while the Samsung will provide more white tones.

I just recently purchased the 46B8500, and between the two sets there is not much of a difference in picture quality.  The blacks are very good on the B750, almost as good as the B8500.  The only difference I could state between the two sets is that I think the 240hz setting on the B8500 works a tad better than the B750.  I have the 240hz set to custom and have blur reduction set to 10 and judder reduction set to 0, and the B8500 looks normal while the B750 still has that video look with that setting.  But overall I am very happy with the purchase of the 52B750..now the one caveat.  This TV has IR interference, after getting this set my Directv HR20 receiver stopped responding to IR commands.  I placed a blanket over the tv and the directv receiver started responding, displaying the controls with the screen covered still didn't stop the directv receiver from responding but once I uncovered the screen the directv receiver stopped responding to any IR commands.  After doing a google search this seems like a common issue with these sets, google \"ir remote interference LCD Samsung\" and you will see quite a few results.  I placed a piece of paper in front of the IR location on the directv box and it seemed to be a temporary fix.  I am going to get some masking tape and use a sharpie to color it black and place it over the IR so it doesn't look too tacky.

The 240Hz makes a huge difference to the point that you actually have to get used to it. It looks weird at first and kind of freaky! It seems like you're actually on the set of the movie or show!! This is the first review I've ever written for anything I've purchased on amazon. That's how good this TV is!!I did a lot of research prior to buying this TV (read all the reviews on Amazon and CNET, as well as went to check it out at BestBuy and Fry's). I was deciding between this tv and the Samsung UN55B7000 55-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED HDTV, which was about $400 more (The 240Hz LED was significantly more expensive). The LED tv was shocking in terms of it's thinness but it seems like from all reviews that I was able to find, you're basically paying more for the wow factor of the physical appearance of the TV. If you've got deep pockets, then you might wanna go with the LED 'cause it seems like that's were technology is heading. But beware, it is fairly new and it doesnt seem like enough time has passed for these companies to hammer out the kinks with LED's as it seems like they've managed to do with LCD's.One of the drawbacks of this TV is the sound. The speakers are on the back and face toward the wall but with a tv like this, you have to pair it with a home theater system to get the full experience.Take this review with a grain of salt since I'm still in the honeymoon period. I was hesitant of getting such a large piece of electronic equipment through Amazon but I'm very happy with my purchase so far. I would also recommend getting the extended warranty for that extra piece of mind as it seems like Samsung has poor Customer Service from the various reviews I've read.I've been raving about this tv to my friends but if you decide to go with a different tv just make sure you do your homework and go with a 240Hz for sure!!", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best LCD tv for money", "Author": "Jason R.

So lifelike.Uncharted 2 PS3 Game - Breathtaking.Xbox 360:Assassin's Creed 2 - Weird halo around the main character until I switched on Game Mode. It disappeared after that. Looked great.Various downloaded SD and HD content - Fine. SD content is noticeably worse then HD, but that is expected.This review is strictly based on the picture quality. I did not use the built in speakers on the TV at all.The picture quality is out of this world. It's so good, that it makes the DVDs look like totally different versions of the films. It's almost too good. It makes every single special effect stand out, and only the absolute best pass for reality. For instance, on Return of the Jedi, everything that was digitally added looks very obviously fake and cheesy now. Which is almost a bad thing, but not quite, because everything that is practical (the actors themselves) are right in the livingroom with me. Simply stunning picture, and inky black levels the likes of which I have only seen on $8k+ plasma displays. I have never in my life seen picture quality this good on a TV in this price range. It's fantastic. Do NOT hesitate to buy this TV.Delivery guys from Pilot were awesome and very friendly - called to say they would be a half hour late, which was a nice touch. They set it up for me and waited until I hooked everything up and was happy with it before they asked me to sign for it. Amazon Customer service is awesome, as always. Win/Win.

I haven't found the \"Perfect\" setup yet, but it came very nice out of the box and I am not in a hurry to sit and mess with it for a few hours for what would amount to a small incremental improvement.Upscaling:  Much better than the Receiver I have it hooked up to (Pioneer VSX-1019AH-K 7-Channel A/V Receiver (Black)) which by the way is amazing, especially for the price.  Use the TV for upscaling, not the receiver.Performance:  Great.  I use for Wii, PS3 (Games and Blue Ray), and Digital Cable.  No problem with high action games or fast movement.  No special settings needed.  Just played Batman: Arkham Asylum and Wet (no not adult) with great results.Sound:  Who cares, I use a receiver.  But it is fine for a TV.Size:  Awesome, especially from my 10 foot viewing range.O.K. there are some small gripes, but far from show stoppers.Media Play through USB:  It works great, but certain embedded audio tracks get out of sync  more and more through the movie.Also, COME ON, SAMSUNG!  pay for the license for DTS.  I have mkv files that I don't want to mux up and not be as good.Also, would it kill you to be able to play a m2ts file.I would especially like to see Media Play through eSata Port.  No worries of file size then.The new firmware update did add fast forward and rewind and a couple other nifties, but the above would be better.Shipping and Service:  Amazon was difficult at best on the order.  I was on the phone with customer service more than 8 times to get the thing paid for and delivered, and eventially lost the interest free payment I was looking for.When it was delivered, the box was severely damaged.  I almost didn't accept it, but I got on the phone with the Big Screen Department, and they were great.  They were ready to ship a new one and pick up the old that same day.  I plugged it in and everything worked fine.  (Did I mention the entire lower right corner of the box was ripped off, ie dropped).  That caused the remote and extra junk to be missing but I ordered that through Samsung and the Big Screen Dept reimbursed me that day.Aamazon Customer Service:  Shame on you. Big Screen Dept Kudos.Overall great set.  When my wife saw I ordered it she said, \"Why would we ever need such a big TV?\"  I looked at her because I didn't even come close to understanding the question.Now she just looks at me and says, \" We really made a great decision with this TV, it is amazing.\"  HMMMPH.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN52B750", "Author": "D.

I hope the Yahoo and independent developers keep up the good work and we see Hulu, Netflix (1080P), ESPN and Pandora widgets debut soon. Also, a texting friendly remote control would add real teeth to the Twitter widget. The BD live (S/W updates via internet) and DLNA features (havent tried yet) are a nice touch as well. I wont talk about the picture quality because it has been done to death (its good! and at 52 inches of screen area you cannot help but be impressed).I got this one with the Free Shipping, Free Netbook (Asus eeePC) and $250 Price Coupon offer. The pre-adjustment price of $2199 was a little higher than what it has been recently, but I was tired of watching the price go up and down.

There is 1 very, very slight cloud that is visible when the screen is completely black and you are in a completely dark room, but even then you have to specifically look for it.With my A850, I was completely frustrated and distracted when watching it, but the B750 has been all that I expected and more. I'm extremely happy with it.

I thought the sound was good for a flat panel, so I'm not complaining. I don't care about the internet connectivity so I won't even go there. The features that had me excited was the dejudder processing, unlike many Samsung's sets before this one, this set has individually adjustable Motion Blurr and Judder processing settings.If you are sick of that Sop oera effect just decrease the Judder without having to sacrifice the Motion Blurr setting. I find that a setting for Motion Blurr at 10 with a Judder setting of 4 gives the most realistic picture, I like the 100% backlit remote also, just as gorgeous as the piano black finish on the set.If you buy this LCD HDTV you will not be sorry as this Samsung set is the best available on the market period!

I have yet to notice any motion blur and there is a lot of options to suite the needs for different inputs and settings.I do wish that Samsung would provide direct input buttons though. Many TV's have gone away with this option but it really is a must for people using universal remotes with macro buttons. To create a macro on my universal remote that will power on the TV and set a specific input, I have to engage in a lengthy process.- Power on the TV and wait several seconds before it will accept any other inputs from the remote. (The boot up time is actually a little long).- Set the TV to the standard \"Cable\" screen. (Necessary because without establishing a consistent starting point, you cannot step correctly to a specific input as the TV will default to the last used input first)- Select the \"Source\" button. (This brings up a pretty menu of the inputs available but grays out the ones that you do not have a powered device connected to so make sure you have everything powered on already)- Down arrow through the menu \"X\" number of times.

I purchased this right after Christmas after seeing my parents 50-inch Samsung plasma. When I saw that they could connect to the internet...I was like: \"No Way\"This review isn't about the technical aspects or picture quality....reviewer EarlyMon has quite an extensive review and his review made me pull the trigger on this one. I highly recommend reading his review and ask follow-up questions under the review. So why did I buy this? Honestly, this was my first 'flat-screen' TV....I previously had it in my cart for 6 months....trying to decide and do my research. I try not to buy anything first generation...too pricey, too buggy and this TV I believe is the prime of LCD/ 240 Hz technology. Even though I knew there was going to be a big push for 3D TVs in 2010 and Samsung usually updates their models in the 1st quarter of the year, I still decided to go with this. I figure I'll wait on 3D until more content is broadcast in 3D and the technology is developed so you don't have to wear those glasses.But back to the TV....this Sammie (yes, I named her) is the center-piece of my living room....it makes me want to watch TV...more lately movies as TV has so much garbage on it. The glass base and pedestal are sleek...the 'Touch of Grey' is sexy (you can set it to be off while watching or constantly on)....even the optional power-on melody is sexy. Picture quality is STUNNING....even when watching non-HD broadcasts, the picture is amazing. The Auto Motion Plus allows for 'upconverting' of signals....careful of the \"soap-opera effect' for picture...but again, reviewer EarlyMon has excellent settings to avoid this.Audio: When watching regular TV, I use the TV speakers...when I'm watching a movie, concert, sports or playing a game....I crank up my AV receiver....in my opinion, if you're getting a TV this great, you're going to want a good  home theater system.The Yahoo Widgets are okay...not the fastest, or most convenient, but an added benefit.....I have yet to be able to log into my twitter account on this. The remote control is awesome....looks sexy and has great functionality....not a serious All-in-one remote, but it can hold it's own.For internet access...you don't need to buy the pricey Samsung wireless dongle....if your modem is close to the TV, you can plug your network cable in there.The TV swivels quite easily to about 35 degrees....for when I'm in the kitchen. I was a bit worried about the viewing distance...I live in a small condo, but my couch is right at 9 feet from the screen (far below the 12-feet recommended by Amazon)...but everyone thinks it is the perfect distance.....let's just say that the ladies were actually watching the game (and not just the commercials) at my Super Bowl Party.Sammie attracts dust quite a bit at the base...but nothing a quick wipe can't fix....the included LCD cloth and a splash of water is all I use on the screen.I would recommend at least a 56-inch TV stand/ console...haven't seen it wall-mounted...but I prefer stands anyway (hides the cables).Oh...numerous component and stereo inputs/ outputs...three HDMI are in the back...one at the side (concealed) which I plug my laptop in.Overall though, this is a work-of-art. A solid investment.

Anyway, ordered this TV, telescoping mount, Playstation, and accessories from Amazon.  All but the PS came in 4 days!!!!  OK, what about the TV?  Blackest blacks, almost 3D like picture.  Sound is not theater-like, but more than adequate.  We are thrilled.  I can't imagine an LED being much better.  This is phenomenal.  I saved at least $300 between this and the mount by buying at Amazon.  Would not hesitate to buy anything from Amazon again and would definitely by the Samsung again.  At any price, this is it.  No, I'm not a videophile, but I watch a lot of TV and this one is fantastic.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "samsung 52 lcd touch of grey", "Author": "C.

The color and the HD make the images look like they are coming right out of the set.

There are al lot of features made available through the network we wstablished that we have not explorred to date.However with that being said, I must really give you the down side of purchasing this high television set from Amazon. To be blunt the delivery company that Amazon used plain down sucked. Amazon gave the date when the set would be delivered. In order to make sure we were home during the time period gived, I took three days vacation from work. When the set was not delivered during the time frame stated, I checked my Amazon account and found out that the delivery service had notified Amazon they had attempted delivery and notified the customer of the attempt. Noow it was now up to us to schedule delivery hoever no contact information was given to us through Amazon ot the delivery service. I had to do a Google search to find out contact information.When I contacted the company they apologized for the problem they created and the manager assured us that the set would be delivered between 8:00 AM and noon on Friday. Low and behold the set was not delivered until almost 4:00 Friday afternoon. The driver showed us his delivery schedule that stated not to deliver until afternoon.I wrote e-mails to Amazon complaining about how thia company is most certainly destroying their reputation and have never received a reply, which makes me wonder if Amazon really cares about providing customer service.Summing this review up we would absolutely purchase this Samsung TV again, but we do not know if we would ever purchas an item this large through Amazon again.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Picture Quality", "Author": "S.

I have not messed with the settings much on a count that there has not seemed to be any reason to.  Like I said it realy has been amazing right of the box.

The price was a full $500 less than the price of the new set. I might have just gotten lucky, but in this case this $500 gamble seems to have paid off big time. I am very happy so far with the product I received. And my kids are very happy that there was an additional $500 in the Christmas budget that I had not originally accounted for.One other point I would like to mention is, some of the reviewers specifically mention Netflix and Amazon Video support natively on this TV as of fall of 2009.

To help the newbies like myself out there I'm providing a list of confusions/surprises I found using the product.1.  The Amazon on-demand service is \"temporarily unavailable\".  Check it out here http://www.amazon.com/gp/video/ontv/samsung. There is no date on the website, so I don't know when this started but I've had the tv 2 weeks and never have I seen this feature.  Amazon should tell users this before they purchase the tv.  It does have a similar feature from Blockbuster.2. Analog cable TV doesn't look great.  I've never owned another LCD tv so I have nothing to compare this to, but it seems worse than on my old (much smaller) CRT tv.  I'm going to try using an external TV tuner in my computer with it and see if it improves. (From other internet posts this sounds like a common complaint with LCD tv's but I have never seen an explanation as to why it occurs)3. If you send a digital audio in as an input (DVD player), and try and use the digital output it cuts the output down to stereo.  Although if you use the digital audio out when you used the internal tv tuner on a digital station the same digital out will be surround.  Moral of the story don't assume you can use the tv as a pass-through audio device.4. The digital audio outs will not produce a signal on an analog tv station.  I had assumed it would encode a stereo digital stream but it doesn't.  This makes using an audio receiver a little more confusing as you have to tell the receiver what inputs to use to get the best audio depending on whether you are using a digital or analog tv station.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung 52\"", "Author": "Larry D.

Reasons for choosing this included excellent review by CNET and Consumer Reports (higher rating than Sony XBR), great price from amazon.com including \"white glove\" delivery, and Internet connectivity. I compared it side-by-side at a local Best Buy store to Samsung's LED TV that cost 50% more, and there was no discernible difference.The Pilot \"white glove\" delivery guy not only assembled the TV on the stand, but helped place it in the cabinet after moving the old TV to the bedroom. He waited until it was powered and tested with a Blue Ray.The TV looks awesome, although the piano black finish shows even the slightest fingerprints and dust. The \"mirror\" effect is so prominent that it took a while to realize that there is only one side connector panel, and the \"second\" is just a reflection in the cabinet! The swivel base allows for adjustment when pulled out of the cabinet.The picture is fabulous for Blue Ray, and indeed superb - not only for HD, but more importantly for SD since most of our cable channels are SD. Unlike the plasma that never had any blurring no matter how fast moving the picture, this LCD does show some; unless you change your settings. That means tinkering every time you watch a different type of programming. The advantage of course is that the TV runs a lot cooler than the plasma and doesn't heat up the cabinet. The sound is good, and not an issue since the TV provides optical output into our Denon receiver that outputs the sound through a 5.1 speaker system.The TV setup scanned all the channels, and better yet, deleted the scrambled ones from the list to un-clutter it. The TV is connected to the Internet, and is able to access various programs from CBS, Yahoo, YouTube etc. Unfortunately, it doesn't allow access to login to accounts that you might have already set up at these sites. Thus for example, you can do a YouTube search using a popup keypad, but cannot access your YouTube personal favorites list by logging into your YouTube account.

Much of what needs to be said has already been said so I will only reinforce the stunning picture quality of this tv. Most people will never see HD at its full potential, be it blu-ray, the airwaves, cable or the dish. You will never look at a picture and think the tv is a window unless you're connected directly to the source, digital compression is the culprit. Anyone that thinks otherwise either needs an eye exam or seriously has not seen true hd, sorry, the FCC, rules of the airwaves and greed will always hold the quality back. With that being said, out of the box this tv looks about as close as you're going to get. Over the air signal is probably the least compressed followed by either blu-ray or cable (How do you think the dish people get so many channels on their birds anyway? Heavy compression - No, I am not slamming the dish, just stating a fact)To show how good the picture is out of the box, very little needs to be changed to achieve full professional calibration. Even watching dvds this tv has a way of making them look clear as glass. I recommend NOT using an upconverting dvd player/HDMI as it passes on digital compression, if you use Component instead, the tv is expecting a certain amount of analog noise, the input filters do their job and it looks fantastic. Want proof? Watch the intro to Stargate SG-1, say the last season, the Antarctic scene is very full of digital noise if you use the HDMI input, try it again with Component, it's almost speckle free. Same series, any episode, when they're in the Colonel's office sitting, the door is usually open at a 45 degree angle. HDMI, very speckled, Component is almost perfect. The input filter doesn't appear to cut down the resolution of the image, it just handles digital noise differently.Cons - I bought this tv because of the bad reviews on the LED series sets. The complaints that the menus were slow as if they had to 'load' each option and that certain functions were greyed out/inaccessible. Well, much to my disappointment I downloaded a setup guide from tweaktv and started plugging away on this tv. Calibrating this set according to the guide is no substitute for a professional but based on modern manufacturing techniques, you can come pretty damn close as every unit is close to identical! The same problems that plague the LED series exist here as well. The menus are so slow to pop up sometimes you wonder how well the remote reception is working as it is quite nonresponsive. Certain items were greyed out/inaccessible much like the review of the LED series. I have asked around how to overcome this issue and no-one knows, even Samsung is unable to provide a useful answer. To change video sources, much like the LED series you have to hit several buttons. I don't remember my 71 series being this difficult because it wasn't.Don't let my Cons be a deterrent to purchasing this tv or even the LED series, how often do you go into the menus or switch video sources? It's only a minor annoyance on an otherwise great tv.It should be noted they released a firmware update on Nov 9th, I am in the process of downloading it now on my slow connection, what it addresses is to be seen, I didn't see any readme notes prior to downloading.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "not a videophile", "Author": "John W", "ReviewID": "R1AFS4BLL5CQP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a videophile or audiophile.  This is my first HD TV and my first venture into the DLP/plasma/LCD/LED world...I am a novice.  I bought my set on November 18, 2009 after a few days of research...most of it from the Amazon site.  My set worked perfectly out of the box.  I got an easily readable paper manual in the box.  The remote works fine and is easy to figure out.  The onscreen directions are among the best I've ever seen.  However, my frame of reference is a 5 year old Sharp TV which had horrible documentation and worse onscreen prompting.  There is minimal glare from lights and the nearby floor to ceiling windows (but even if there was, I could close the blinds), the black on the screen is very black, the blue is very blue, the red is very red, without calibrating anything, and the internal speakers sound very good.  The set has wonderful features...most of which I will never use...I bought this set to get a sharp picture.  I am a college basketball fan, and I can tell you that I can easily see the names on the jerseys of the players on my alma mater's basketball team...from eleven feet away. I can also see the acne scars on the coaches face, the freckles on the boyish star center's nose (which I had no idea he had from my former TV), the sweat beading up on their faces, and their footprints on the arena floor...I got more than I expected.For the rest of you novices out there who want a great television, I would suggest that this set will EXCEED your expectations", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Flawless product", "Author": "David Coulson", "ReviewID": "R1FA565HRP6SOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this TV for around six weeks...

The piano black finish with the barely noticeable gray at the bottom looks excellent and high class. The touch of color is no longer a distraction. The 240 hz is very smooth and makes all movies including older movies like those from the 50s and 60s on HD channels look very crisp. The blacks are deep and you can tell the contrast ratio is top notch. 1080i uverse looks great. The preloaded art content really shows off the quality of the TV when displaying quality content. You can wow your sophisticated friends with this one. There are about 7-8 impressionist paintings and you should really check out the Manet in a boat one. I don't use any of the widgets as they are laggy and kinda useless.

We've had a rear projection TV for years and this is our first LCD so we were worried about motion blur.  NONE noticed.  Sporting events look phenomenal.  The detail is unheard of.  There was a recommendation to turn Dynamic Contrast off.  But this is what gives the details such as faces in the crowd, blades of grass, etc.  We love it and have played around with the picture settings but have decided so far not to adjust any of them.  We like the crisp, detailed image.I am no technical wiz, but I suggest changing the audio since the default \"custom\" sounds hallow.  There are many great audio options in the menu settings.  We are happy with \"standard\".  Be aware however that certain features such as Game mode only work with \"custom\" audio.  Kind of a bummer.  We just won't experiment with game mode.  Obviously for those using a surround system none of this matters.  We are happy with the TVs audio after changing the setting.Screen glare was another concern, but worth the risk for the improved features on this TV.  Ours is next to a sliding glass door and faces two large windows.  When the TV is off, the glare is like a mirror.  However, when on, glare is hardly noticable.  Yeah, if you look for it you can find it, but it does not affect the viewing pleasure whatsoever.  Pretty remarkable.As far as delivery, Pilot service was good.  BUT it was delivered from Amazon quickly, then sat at their warehouse for a week before making it to our home.  Evidently they have been getting swamped with this order so things are backed up.

The low def pictures are better than the hi def ones were on the old set.

The BluRay discs in Theater mode played well but the regular HD TV (AT&T; Uverse) was less than satisfactory. I tried adjusting the picture settings many times and no matter what, the colors looked artificial to me and it also had the problem of fluctuating back light. I also have a Samsung LN32A450, which I think has outstanding picture quality for both HD and non-HD programs. I decided to take a loss and sell the Sony.I then started looking into the 52\" 2009 models. Based on the Excellent rating provided by CNET, I started seriously looking at this TV and bought it a month back. I am very satisfied with the purchase.I now have two very good TVs from Samsung and can highly recommend this product.After a few attempts for picture setting, I have settled on the following:NaturalBacklight: 3Contrast: 97Brightness: 61Sharpness: 45Color: 43Color Tone: NormalSize: Screen Fit (most channels have white flashing lines in the bottom, so I switch back to 16:9)Energy saving: offI have a pleasing picture which looks natural and is as good or better than my 32\" Samsung A450 for HD. Non-HD display is OK but I don't watch much of it any way.I can't really say if the 240 HZ or the 2 ms response time contributes much to the performance of the TV but I think the higher contrast ratio (150,000:1) does. Lot of the movies I saw in the Sony are much better on this TV, very good black level, contrast and color.The reflective screen was a bit of a concern before I bought the TV as I have a window on the side, but is not as bothersome as CRT TVs (no issue with the matte screen in the Sony). Sony had better sound quality than the Samsung.Haven't used much of the Yahoo widgets but maybe someday. The internet connectivity can be handy. Although my internet settings are fine, when I try to do an online SW upgrade, I get a message \"Connection failed (600)\".Registered the product with Samsung and got 3 months of additional warranty.If we are spending over 2k for a TV, it is fine to expect a little perfection. I think you can most certainly get that from this TV. The LED TVs are very slim and looks attractive, but if picture quality is your primary concern, this TV might do just fine.", "Date": "June 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "samsung ln52b750", "Author": "S.

The sound quality isn't that impressive, but I guess it's acceptable for a flat panel.My only dislike about the TV is when ever I turn it on, I hear this buzzing noise that sounds like a loud static buzz/hiss that plays on top of the musical intro noise.  This sound varies each time I turn the TV on and I heard it was related to some transformer issue, but I'm not sure.  I can live with it and I'm not about to return a TV because of this minor defect.I couldn't tell any difference comparing the LED version and this TV to justify the price increase so I didn't go with the LED one.  I suppose the LED one may have a longer life, but I figure by then they will have even better TV's.The remote has weird curve at the bottom which bothers some people.

Glad I didnt.. This thing is the top of the line for 2009 and even at a discounted price of $1899, I got a BETTER deal! Only $1159.00 for this beast!And it is a BEAST. So big its almost TOO big. ITS BEAUTIFUL! I picked a used version from warehouse deals since I'm on a budget, and I can return if I need to.....( also purchased a warranty from Square trade for much much cheaper than anywhere else I might add), Let me tell you. pictures DO NOT DO IT JUSTICE! So much better than my 42\" LG!!!!I followed earlmon's setup suggestions...gorgeous stutter free picture! not a scratch on the tv! I looked for the best used one they had....it came in all origianl packaging, only blemish was some VERY MINOR scratches on the BACk bezel, so minor in fact, I had to search for them...only thing missing was the USb thumb drive, which is odd, because that was one the list of items it came with..remote? i have a samsung home theater, and its remote is matte, and collects fingerprints than the glossy one that comes with this tv.The touch of color is nice..and unobtrusive. When I first saw the touch of color (red) in a brick and mortar, I thought I would like it...but this one, which you can turn off, is WAAAAYYY better.As an avid gamer, once I get both my xbox 360 and PS3 fixed, I will tune the tv, and post what settings work for me. My friend brought his Xbox360 over, with the tv less than an hour old out of the box, with no setting adjustments, with game mode on, and all I can say is....WOW! He has a much smaller 32\" Vizio 1080p 60 hz. He was blown away by this thing. He thought it looked grainy and gray, but when you look at the overall level, it was a game level design, and not the tv. the blacks were fantastically dark, in areas that needed (IE; designed to be ), and light where they were supposed to.

I set it up on Saturday, and wouldn't you know it, it would not power on.  Boy, was I mad.  A $2,000.00 tv that would not power on.  I opened a support ticket with Samsung.  I thought Amazon would exchange it for me. To my dismay, Amazon would not exchange the tv without a reference number from Samsung.  I had to call Samsung customer support and get the reference number.  I played the game and contacted Samsung, only to find out I would be contacted by Samsung ECRA department within the next two to three business days.  Well, I waited until Wednesday (called on Sunday), and no call from the ECRA department.  I initiated another call to Samsung to talk with someone directly in the ECRA department.  After two calls, the first call was placed on hold for well over 20 minutes, I got to talk with someone at Samsung.  I was told I would have to wait for a repair man to come to the house to determine what the problem is/was.  To make a long story short, the repair man determined that the main circuit board in the tv was burnt out.  He has no idea how and when it occurred.  I now have a tv that is suppose to be new, but is really refurbished from Samsung/Amazon.  Not overly thrilled about the picture on the tv, kind of fuzzy.  From what I learned from this experience is don't buy major appliances online.  I also would not have the luxury of contacting my mastercard company and complaining about a defective product.

I tried to adjust the lean by tightening the screws, but they didn't really \"bite\" properly.I was able to lessen the amount it leaned forward, but not correct it.I contacted Samsung Customer/Technical support.  They said that I needed to tighten the screws, and that was the problem.  I proceeded to do as they instructed, but I couldn't correct the issue.  I called Technical/Customer support a second time, and explained the problem.  They said that the issue was considered abuse and that I had now voided my television's warranty.  Not just for the mounting issue, but the entire warranty.I explained that the television arrived in a damaged box and that I was extremely careful and had followed their instructions.  None of this mattered.  The mount is a poor design, and is made out of plastic. They said that I should purchase a wall mount for the TV.  This was completely unacceptable.  I don't want it wall mounted, and it was damaged upon arrival.  They refused to help me in anyway and wouldn't correct the problem.I informed them that if I had to I would initiate a credit card chargeback, and they said that I should go ahead.I contacted Amazon Customer Support.  They were wonderful.  They took care of the problem immediately, and said they would contact Samsung about their lack of support.They credited my money back and shipped me out a new Samsung LED tv.

I need to use the 5.1 outputs from my DVD player to get Dolby Digital which means an HDMI input is useless to me.  The factory settings for color are far too saturated to be natural, so do make your own settings.  I have read several articles on the 240hz feature.  Some say defeat this function.  My set says it only is getting 720 x 480i @ 60hz.  I called Samsung and got some mumbo-jumbo of why it is not saying it's in 240hz.  Overall, it is an awesome set with decent sound.

On June first I receive an email from Amazon saying that my \"gift card\" payment could not be processed and my TV order has been cancelled.  What gift card?? I used my Amazon credit card to pay for the TV. I called Amazon Visa and was told that no \"charge\" had been submitted to my account, and if it had been, there would be no reason why it would not have been accepted. I called Amazon customer service and got connected to someone who could barely speak English...no doubt Amazon out sources to workers in foreign countries instead of employing American workers. After requesting and speaking with a \"supervisor\" (who also spoke broken English) I was advised to re-order the TV, but nothing could be done to retain the original $400 discount as it was past the program expiration date. I politely told the \"supervisor\" that I was extremely unhappy with this and that Amazon would never see my business again. Against my better judgement, I did reorder the TV and to my surprise the \"expired\" $400 discount appeared at check out !I received the TV last Friday, only one day later than the original order had been scheduled for delivery. The  Pilot delivery man was top notch. He did not have a helper with him yet he wanted to struggle carrying the heavy and bulky box upstairs and into my bedroom without my help. I insisted that I give him a hand because he never could have done it alone. He quickly unpacked the TV and connected it to verify that it showed a picture.Now for my opinion of this TV. If their was a rating less than one star, it would have deserved it!  Comparing it to my inexpensive 37\" Vizio TV the picture is horrible. Any text on the screen has fuzzy edges to it. The picture reminds me of an old rear projection TV with color bulbs out of alignment. DVD playing performance can be described as \"shaky\"...almost enough to get the viewer sea sick. No amount of fine tuning the adjustments made any noticable difference to the picture. To top it all off, the remote only works when it decides to!  Trying to switch between the various TV inputs with the remote is an exercise in fustration. A change of batteries made no difference.  I can add this product to the list of other devices made by Samsung that have not performed well for me. That includes a DLP TV that blew lamps every 800 hours and now has completely stopped working, a upconversion DVD player that lasted about a week past the warranty expiration and a digital tuner that thought it was a room heater.  I will never purchase another Samjunk product.  I am going to call Amazon to have this TV exchanged for a new Sony 52\" Bravia Z Series.  Unlike this Samsung, the Sony comes with an actual physical owners manual and an S-video imput for those who might still want to hook up a VCR and get a decent picture from it.
