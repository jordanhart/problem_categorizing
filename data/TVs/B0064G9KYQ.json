Thanks for this item.  Before this I had my TV on a dresser and now I have more space to have some electronics in that space instead of having the TV taking up that space.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING! Definately recommend", "Author": "linda", "ReviewID": "R161KYGWYOCYTL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the picture quality and all its features. Best tv i have had so far. I recieved it damaged at first which is why I only gave it four Stars but thanks to the retailers who sold it to me I was able to get another tv (same make and model) and see how wonderfully it works. It has 2 hdmi ports, surround sound, etc. I would definitely recommend this tv to anyone and everyone.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good. Only 1 small issue", "Author": "Dj Duncan", "ReviewID": "RKGDJ45WENBFJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is an excellent TV. I've had it for a couple years now and I haven't had any issues until recently. It will turn off on me randomly and I'll have to struggle with turning it back on because it'll shut off continuously (3-5 times in a row). After the short battle, it stays on until I shut it off. This doesn't really interfere with the viewing quality, just an annoyance that I'm looking into. If anyone knows what the issue is and has a solution, feel free to let me know. I figure its the power supply as the TV seems to cut all power to it and struggle to stay on. Overall, excellent TV for the price.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "LED Technology for a Super Slim Design\nBrilliant Color, Contrast, and Sound\nMultiple Inputs Cater to All Your Devices\nFeatures a slim 1.0-inch edge profile thanks to the all-LED backlit LCD display.", "Name": "Westinghouse LD3240 32\" LED HDTV Super Slim", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xO9SQEr6L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0064G9KYQ"}}
