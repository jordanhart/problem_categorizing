{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Nicest TV Right Now", "Author": "Corey Fisher", "ReviewID": "RNJBG3X5LGBSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is absolutely stunning. I was actually waiting for the C9000 to come out, but that TV's price is way over the limit. I found out that this TV which is the next step down and actually has the exact same technology as the C9000 minus the touchscreen remote (which can be bought seperately) and the slim profile, not a big deal considering the TV already looks beautiful and is half the price or less then a C9000!In all honesty, I think this TV has one of the nicest pictures I've ever seen. One example is the pin-point dimming, which has garnered a lot of criticsm and skeptisism. I have seen the production TV model live and I must tell you, I think it's better then local-dimming and I'll tell you why... Unless there is a new panel that is made to fix the local-dimming \"halo affect\", this is currently the only way to get outradgeous contrast levels without that problem. The pin-point dimming on this TV dramatically lowers the dark spots on the screen in certain area's without a halo affect and actually goes completely pitch black when watching movies with dark screens just like a local-dimming TV. I think this TV actually excels at the dimming part over a local-dimming TV because it creates supurb black levels without any halo affects. That's a huge deal for me. Next is the color accuracy of this panel, I think the whites and colors on this TV are probably better then I've ever seen. Sure Plasma's can sometimes have better color temperatures, but they will not pop out of the screen with ambience like this TV shows. This TV is sharp looking and beautiful and it displays wonderful 3D and High-definition like never before.Last, but not least... this tv is LOADED with features, easily making it one of the most feature rich TV's there is on the market. It's completely wireless, has 4-hdmi conenctions, has internet applications and streaming capabilities and best yet, it does it well! I have done a lot of research and have compared this TV with it's newest competitors and this one is it. Don't just take my word for it, go see it for yourselves and you'll just see what I am talking about.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Picture that is worth a Thousand Words", "Author":

is unmatched. I know that sounds like hyperbole, but in this case it really is the truth. prior to purchasing I had spent about 6 months going to box stores and staring at various televisions. In all of that time I decided that the Samsung LED's were in class by themselves. At long last I was ready to make the purchase and I decided to order from Amazon.com in fact the price was attractive enough that I went ahead and ordered the Samsung UN46C8000 46\" 1080p 3D LED TV, 1080p Resolution, 3D Technology, 3D HyperReal Picture Engine, Touch of Color Design, Kit Includes 2 Pairs of 3D Glasses, BD-C5900 1080p 3D Blu-ray DVD Player, Dig Pro HDMI Cable.Wow.In all of my travels to box stores I never came across a picture that was as good as the C8000. Nothing is even close.A few of my notes- I have never used the television in 3D, and I doubt if I will until sometime next year. To be honest the 3D accessories are too expensive and the available content is too sparse. So why would I buy a 3D television? Well for the price of the Samsung C8000 I am able to get a 3D television for the price of a different mid-range television. However, with the C8000 I get the industry's best picture and the expandability of 3D for a later date. Really how can you lose?- The picture is both bright and crisp. The detail is beyond belief. The best way to describe it is that the picture resembles a professional photo (print) in a high quality frame.- 4 HDMI inputs - Please note that 3D televisions require high-speed HDMI cables. Take my advice and save yourself some $$$ by purchasing AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters) [Supports 3D + Audio Return Channel] - no need to thank me, but you will save major cash.- The internet tv function and Samsung apps are interesting, but far from critical. You may find yourself using them, but you will likely use your Tivo, PS3 or other device to stream you content.- The actual \"look\" of the television is remarkable. It looks like a giant brushed titanium picture frame. The television is less than 1\" (roughly the same thickness as the remote control).- Sound quality - is good, but not to the same quality as the picture. You may want to consider in investing in an audio system.- While it is internet ready, the C8000 is NOT wireless. Seems like an odd oversight.... unless Samsung is just pressing to sell more Samsung WIS09ABGN LinkStick Wireless LAN AdapterFinal Verdict - Everyone who has  watched my television has been amazed. I really do think that it is both the value and picture on the market today.5 Stars", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Truely breath taking picture quality", "Author": "Hardware4you", "ReviewID": "R27KGV2JTX8U1C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being an electronics buff, I hold a high standard to quality.  This Samsung UN46C8000 is amazing.  Picture quality is the best I have ever seen.  From the quality remote to the stand this television is the set for you.  After it was programmed and user preferences were set, the first HD channel was a golf tournament on Golf Channel HD.  Truely breath taking!!!  My other HD sets are Plasma ranging from 58 to 32 inches.  This is the first LED television I have owned.  Being one inch thick, weighing in at 55 lbs it was very easy to handle.  The picture quality on non 3D broadcast makes it look like a modified 3D.  I have never seen anything like it.  My wife who could not care the least about technology, was very impressed with the picture quality.Amazon made the purchasing experience painless with no sales tax and inside delivery.  The delivery staff unbox your television, plug it in to make sure it works and are friendly to boot.  Last but not least, you will be very impressed.  I am very impressed with this next generation of quality.  Samsung you definitely  got this one right!!!!Update:All of the above comments are still true.  I have watched my first 3D movie with the glasses and everything worked perfectly.  3D makes movie watching a whole different experience.  Only one major problem...Other than the 3D movie that came with the free Samsung glasses, there are no other choices to purchase.  3D Blu-ray technology has not caught up with the 3D televisions.  ESPN 3D debuts in June on Directv.  The All Star game will be telecast in 3D and the College Football National Championship game will be in 3D. The television had software update available at the Samsung website.  It was easy to update.  The television was manufactured on March 30, 2010 and the software upgrade was available on April 15.  The 3D Blu-ray DVD player also had an update.  Not difficult to perform but a little surprised.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV, But Not Perfect", "Author": "Andrew J. Ventura \"Andy V\"", "ReviewID": "RVYCOOTH46X8K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got the TV a couple of weeks a go and decided to post my first review ever on Amazon, as well this is the largest purchase I've made.  This is my first LCD purchase in a while, I've had a Pioneer Plasma that I've loved forever, but just moved to Boston and left the Pioneer back home.  The picture is extremly clear, almost too clear, sometimes I feel like the TV shows are live action TV, which takes a bit to get used too.  The features seem great.  I read through some of the comments, I'm pretty sure the C8000 doesn't have WIFI, as it wasn't an option, but I had ethernet right behind the TV so I didn't dig super deep.  The Internet options are great, can't wait to try netflix out.  The Yahoo gadget bar is cool and the Internet TV seem great, first time I've had these options on a TV.I watched the masters in 3D, pretty cool, but your eyes get tired pretty quick, active 3D makes your eyes work more than passive 3d IMHO.  I'm stuck with crappy comcast in my new building, so no 1080P coming through for other channels.  I did the 3D combo and got monsters vs aliens.  Wife and I watched a bit of it to check out the 3D.  Way better quality than the Masters in 3D, but to be honest when I remember watching HDTV for the first time versus Standard TV, that leap was way bigger than from HDTV to 3DTV, maybe when more content comes out.  I was hoping to get Avatar 3D, but those jerks are going to wait a year before releasing it.  But atleast Comcast has the 3D Channel, maybe they will do more events in the future.TV is beautiful, nice and thin.  One comment about the C9000 it won't support the pin-point dimming, so the C8000 is Samsungs best picture TV.  That touchscreen remote can be purchased, but it won't allow you to watch TV on the remote with the C8000 like the C9000 does.Setup was simple, haven't really dug deep into the features.  Sound is OK, but then again I'm used to my home theatre.  Does extremely well with the glare and I haven't mounted it on the wall and I'm using the standard stand, comes in handy to turn it slighty to get the glare from the sun out of the picture.One more thing the 3D mode has some ghosting, I wonder if that will be fixed over time.  I do think it is worse when your eyes get tired though.  I don't mind the glasses, but I wouldn't wear them in public ;-)If you are getting a new TV, go for this one, don't be put off by the 3D as a gimic, all TVs are going to ship with them, I don't think you are paying a premimum for the HD.  I still love my Pioneer Plasma, the thing is 6 years old and still has a great picture, but this is way better than the two Sharp LCDs I own, espicially the one I dropped and broke the screen on.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Latest firmware greatly improves 3D performance", "Author": "S. Chapman \"Old School\"", "ReviewID": "R1PPRZP2EY9QTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you've read many of the professional reviews of the UN46C8000, you know that one of the common criticisms has been ghosting and shadows when displaying 3D source material. With the June 28th firmware release, this problem has been greatly reduced and the 3D is spectacular. The new firmware load also adds a new \"3D Optimize\" option to the TV's 3D menu. Selecting this option seems to help minimize ghosting and enhances the 3D effect.Samsung also seems to have done something to reduce the amount of eye strain caused by wearing the 3D glasses. I can wear them for hours now and not notice any particular problem. Unfortunately, there's very little 3D material available yet, but DirecTV's 3D broadcasts are excellent, probably just as good as my one 3D Blu-ray disc.For other, non-3D material, this TV is simply superb. If you want to get the best out of it, I recommend you read the review at Home Theater magazine's web site (no, I'm not affiliated with them) and then configure the TV using their recommended settings. Unless you're already an expert at setting up a TV like this, you will likely get much better results by starting with their suggested settings than you would by starting with the factory defaults.Also, be sure you upgrade the firmware before you adjust the settings, because upgrading the firmware wipes out your customized configuration. Then write down your settings and save them for the next time you need to do a firmware upgrade.One other item I wanted to mention is that several web sites, including televisioninfo, have stated that this TV \"has a very heavy-handed dynamic contrast ratio\" that you can't turn off. Nothing could be further from the truth. Dynamic Contrast can be adjusted or turned off completely under the Advanced menu. When it's off, I notice none of the adverse affects on the picture mentioned in some of these reviews.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "problems with Internet@TV feature", "Author": "M. Matthews", "ReviewID": "R325B306GA6UH9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I gave this four stars because This TV has a nice picture and some of the features work. If I gave it a rating on internet connectivity I would give it only one star though. (note: see also the update I wrote at the end of this review)I'm having a problem with (and apparently I am not alone) the \"Internet@TV\" feature. One of the main features I purchased this model for is the internet application features. There are two types of internet features on this series of Samsung LED TV: One is called \"Widgets\" which gives some very limited internet content and it does work on my setup and communicates via the internet ok, the other feature is called \"Internet@TV\" which presumably gives all the advertised but missing functionality I was looking forward to. Internet@TV does not work with my setup even though my Widgets communicate on the internet fine, I can even go online to shop for, purchase, download and watch videos with my Widgets. I purchased,downloaded and watched one of my favorite shows \"Whale Wars\" the most recent episode. I know for a fact that my internet connection is communicating with the TV with the Widgets.After many hours of trial and error with configuration changes, firmware updates (that was a time-consuming problem as well as Samsung's website url for support files also has problems and also the TV will not do an update online) and unfruitful chats with Samsung techs I did extensive research online and found the problem I am having is a common and known problem with no apparent solution from Samsung at this time.The common complaint is that people who use Verizon as their internet provider are the ones who have the most problem with the Internet@TV feature not functioning and with being able to download support files like firmware updates via Verizon not only via the TV but even when using a PC to try to do so.As a tip for anyone using Verizon as their ISP who wants to try to update their firmware via a PC and USB drive: when you get the link for the download from Samsungs Support website erase the \"org.\" part at the very beginning of the link and try the link... it worked for me, I was then able to download, manuals and firmware with no problem. For example this edited link works for me for the firmware update  [...] well I tried to help with the link but it was apparently deleted and not allowed here.I'm writing this review to warn and inform that this is a concern and that the amount of time that others may waste on trying to get this Internet@TV feature to work with certain ISP such as Verizon or to get Samsung tech support on this issue will likely be be excessive and fruitless.I'm very aggravated by this as most of the advertised features for internet connectivity that I was counting on DO NOT WORK. I would say, as a conservative estimate, I have spent at least 20 hours on this problem and am no closer to resolving it. I am now waiting for Samsung \"Tier 3\" support to return my call.... someday. They agree something is wrong but that my network/internet appears to be operating OK. One of their experts is supposed to call me back..... probably, possibly? maybe? Seemed pretty noncommittal to me. They said if I don't hear from anyone then I can try to call back someday. I never heard back from Samsung \"Tier 3\" or any other Samsung \"tier\". Samsung \"tier 2\" told me all I can do is to call Verizon and tell them they are blocking my access to Samsung's domain and Samsung Internet@TV. I've tried to get help with Verizon but gave up on after trying for a couple of hours with their tech support. I can imagine that Verizon will likely blame it on Samsung anyway.You have been warned! If you buy one of these Samsungs for the internet features and especially if you use Verizon as your ISP... you better keep your box and packaging and make sure you are willing and able to return the unit for another brand or model that will work correctly.If I have any success on this problem I will plan to amend my review here to reflect that in the future.update 8/4/2010: I am amending my review now, my internet@tv function is now working. I did nothing at all to my setup, tv or dsl modem configuration and it started on its own one day. It did a bunch of internet@tv updates automatically and it is working properly now.

I am really impressed. I have to admit that I jumped from a 27'' JVC to the 46'' C 8790 - so from a 5 year old TV to this brand new gadget. Thus the differences are enormous. The most mentionable fact I.M.O. is that black is just black. From former TVs I know what it means if black is something like a misty dark gray... A few days before I watched a Blueray with my wife and within the film we thought the TVs somehow switched off -'cause the screen suddenly turned completely black - then we recognized that it just was a scene within the film ;-)On sunday I watched Germany football cup final (ah yes - you call it \"soccer\"). It was broadcasted in Full HD and it was amazing how natural and vivid the picture looked. I really felt as being in the stadium. Due to the fact that I live in the same city as where the match took place I was able to compare the sky (outside the window in the \"real\" world) to the sky how it looked like in the TV - yeah and didn't notice any difference.Considering the 3D feature. I don not care that much about it - I am an early adopter and I know that this in only the beginning and these are the first steps in bringing 3D to TV sets. Nevertheless it's nice to see what's possible and to get idea of what will be possible in future. There's still a lack of real 3D Bluerays, so we'll have to see. I watched a Star Trek movie with 2D/3D conversion and - yes - it looked three-dimensional and there was some kind of graphical deepness added to the picture. Though this is not comparable to 3D in cinema it's exciting to have something like that at home. It depends on the input material. Tried this with another movie - did not work. Looking forward to upcoming 3D bluerays.Mediaplayer! I got this TV connected to a network router. It immediately discovered my Upnp mediaserver (it's a TwonkyVision which runs on a QNAP NAS). Browsing pctures, music and video was no problem. I needed to do some configuration work on the twonky server to get most of my videos sucessfully displayed and some still don't show up. But at least my Simpons archive is accessible now directly via TV ;-)The only thing I am still not able to get up and running is the timeshift feature. I'm using an external HDD on USB1 of the TV. The system checked and formated it. I am able to pause the TV (starting timeshift) but when I try to contunue watching after 30-40 seconds the picture freezes and I have to switch the channel to get it all working again. If I try to replay the timeshift from its beginning i got a message similar to \"Unsupported mode, please switch the resolution\". I dropped a message to the Samsung support, maybe they know what's this about. Meanwhile I'll try this with another external HDD - maybe that will fix it.But overall I have to say it's a great TV which absolutely meets my requirements. Happy with that!*Update*Timeshift now works for me. My external USB HDD just was too slow to for that feature. Exchanged with another one - works fine :-)", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wow!

Read a lot of reviews but sadly ignored minor things I saw here and there that should have raised a red flag.  First, CNET has really good critical reviews on TV's, check that out before your read anymore user reviews.  I'll make this brief.  The TV is attractive, very sleek.  The picture is great, very bright, great contrast, deep blacks.  The internet connectivity is good for what it is.  Settings are plentiful.  Here is the reason for the 3 stars: If you sit on the middle cushion the TV looks great.  If you sit 2 cushions over, it sucks, plain and simple.  The viewing angle is horrible.  You will see grey blacks and you will actually see the LED light from the edges of the TV.  I can't believe top of the line Samsung LED LCD (from 2010) suffers so terribly from this.  I have a L shaped couch and a love seat on the other side.  My living room is a social place and people watch TV from various angles.  I was sooooooo disappointed when I finally got this TV and If I sat 45 degrees from  the center, the only thing I could see is faded grayish picture.  I was expecting perfection.  Oh, and another thing.  My parents have an older Samsung LCD that's 120Hz and I've noticed the blurring every time something moves fast, its distracting and hardly accurate.  SO, I decided to get the 240Hz, hoping this wouldn't happen.  Guess what, its barely different, it still happens.  Not only watching sports or fast action movies, but even if a girl flips her hair in a movie, you see blurry hair, lame...  Other than that, the TV is great! But to me the inaccurate contrast/picture based on the viewing angle and lame \"motion plus bs\" was enough to make me return it.  Thanks Amazon for giving me 30 days from the day I received it to make sure its what I wanted.  In conclusion, I bought the Samsung Plasma 8000 series from Amazon (I'm a Samsung guy), it solves these problems, its cheaper, its bigger (51\") and there's no compromise, unless you consider the extra $25/year it'll cost you to run it.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung 3D TV 46 inch", "Author": "Robert A.

I still can't believe how thin this TV is.  I vacillated between this one (the 8000) and the 7000, but decided on the 8000 because it can adjust the picture to the light in the room (this can be turned off).

In the final days, I was trying to choose between the 7000 and 8000 models -- the online forums that I found indicated that the 8000 had somewhat better picture quality, but at Amazon the 8000 was priced $500 more than the 7000, a price difference that I couldn't really justify paying for. (To be specific, the Amazon prices at the time were $1400 for the 7000, and $1900 for the 8000; either TV came bundled with blu-ray player and 3D starter kit).I was vacillating between the two. What finally tipped me over the edge to purchasing was finding the UN46C8000 at my local brick-and-mortar Best Buy, bundled with the blu-ray player, starter 3D kit, and in addition, a Samsung-compatible wireless Wi-Fi stick -- all for $1600, several hundred dollars less than at Amazon, even accounting for sales tax. I was shocked. This was (and still is, at the time that I write this) a much better deal than at Amazon. Having purchased from Amazon for years, this is the first time I've seen Best Buy offer a better price than Amazon on any item, especially a big-ticket item.So I bought the 8000 on the spot at Best Buy, brought it home and set it up myself (I prefer to set up my own devices), hooked up the blu-ray player, put on one of the Shrek 3D discs from the starter kit, and wow -- my gf and I, both of us, literally could not stop watching. We dropped everything we were doing to gape at the amazing imagery, and ended up watching the whole movie. If there were any problems with ghosting or flashlighting or non-aligned 3D images or whatnot, they were invisible to us. We were stunned at the detail, the quality of the 3D, the smooth motion and flawless colors. The TV loftily exceeded our expectations, and our expectations were already pretty high going in.This is an incredible TV. I highly recommend it. At $1600 with the bundle, I am very happy with the purchase.One final note. If you do buy this (or any) TV at Best Buy, be careful if you want to purchase cables. I needed a 16-foot HDMI cable to connect the TV in one room to a desktop computer in another room. Best Buy was selling such a cable for almost $200, but I skipped that and instead drove a few miles to MicroCenter, where I bought an equivalent cable for $20. Yes, $20 vs $200 for a cable that is exactly the same in all respects but name brand (and the $20 cable works beautifully in my setup).

This TV is awesome, whether you are buying it for the 3D or just for a great TV.Design - This TV is super thin at 0.9 inches. OK, so not insanely thin as the 2010 flagship 9000 model at 0.3 inches, but then its less than half the price and design wise looks exactly the same. The silver framing is sleek, and if you use one of the internet apps like Picasso you can have photos play on a slideshow to really make it look like a painting. And the supplied stand is very sophisticated too.Picture - This set is replacing a 3 yr old Samsung LCD HDTV, so for me, the difference is amazing. Superb sharpness, contract and colors. I bought this set a few weeks before the World Cup was set to begin and I'm SOOOOOO glad I did!  The 240Hz creates an amazing picture, too good almost for some types of show creating what some call an artificial feel to what you are watching, but its all down to personal preference, and settings can be altered when needed. For me, it's like watching through a window and I love it. Black levels and edge lighting are perfectly good for me - I have it in a well lit room and elevated above a fireplace and picture remains excellent throughout.Internet apps - I was not expecting to use these much, but they actually work really well. I love the AP ticker, and AccuWeather, Yahoo and YouTube are also frequently used. Best of all is that this TV has introduced me to Netflix, where the convenience of just clicking a button on my TV remote makes watching streaming movies and TV shows even easier than watching my DVR.3D - Amazing that this technology can be brought into the home.  My sister bought me a pair of the Samsung SSG-2200AR Rechargeable Adult 3D Glasses, Black and I had the opportunity to watch the semi-finals, 3rd place, and final match of the World Cup in 3D and gotta be honest, was blown away.  Now I know this is new technology for the home-front but for their first foray into this space Samsung is doing quite well.  Not much in the way of native 3D content yet (but what these is is amazing), but the TV will convert 2D to 3D and does this pretty well, especially if you up the 3D depth levels. As you might expect, this works best in a darkened room, with HD signal and action packed scenes.Overall, I am truly impressed with the TV which packs in stunning picture and technology along with the best design aesthetics. Also, you can't go wrong buying through Amazon, I got for 20% off list, free shipping, no tax, and took advantage of their offer of opening an Amazon Store Card with 48-months interest free financing.I do have one small gripe and it's with the delivery people (Pilot Freight Services).  Although the shipment was fast and the delivery people where on time, they just brought in the box set it down asked me to sign the paper and wanted to walk out.  I started to argue with the guy telling him that part of the delivery is the assembly and setup of the TV and to make sure it turns on.  At first he said no but then as soon as I asked him to call his supervisor he realized I'm no fool and with the help of his assistant they unpacked it, assembled the stand, moved it onto my entertainment center plugged in all the cables and turned it on to make sure it worked.  I then signed the delivery sheet and started enjoying my new toy!  So just a note to Amazon, check with your carriers and make sure they understand what is expected of them.

Of course the picture is stunning and with not having yet used a Blu-ray player with the set I can only imagine just how stunning the pq will be once I really let it rip with a decent player. (I've viewed HD content via an HDMI equipped XBOX 360 with Zune HD media and a VGA connected laptop with itunes HD media) I will probably go with Samsung for the 3D Blu-ray player and the 3D glasses.I've been researching flat panel TVs for over 6 years and by taking in all the facts that I learned in that time I felt more than comfortable with my decision to go with Samsung. To further add credence to my opinion it should be noted that not only have I been a computer technician for the past 6 years but my first project as a technician back in '04 was upgrading the HDTV display at several locations for one of the nation's leading discount bulk retailers. I witnessed firsthand the state of the technology at a time when things were relatively new. I've paid close attention over the years to the developments and the various features that have been improved upon.My initial price point was $1000 but I found that at that level so many of the LED TVs didn't have the feature set that I wanted. I felt that if I went under a $1000 that I would be compromising either on size or features or both.The apps are decent and the Pandora app was my main reason for going with an IPTV i.e. connects to the internet. Like another commenter mentioned the apps can be a bit slow since we're used to much faster machines with our apps. The selection is decent but could be more varied. The news apps seem to suffer the most. The AP ticker app is nice but really the only decent news app. I haven't tried the GoogleMaps app but the Accuweather paid app is very nice but doesn't have as much functionality as say WeatherBug which is not available as a Samsung app. All in all I'm pleased with Samsung apps and look forward to what they have down the pipe with this exciting new way to take it 'all' in.I don't like the fact that Plasma sets produce infrared radiation. I can't comment on why that could be a bad thing; I'm just not qualified but what I can say is that an LED set does NOT produce any infrared radiation when producing an image. What I like so much about LED technology is the fact that it uses a considerably less amount of electricity than Plasmas AND traditional LCD sets. So, LCD only TVs use a sort of florescent gas technology and Plasma sets use a plasma gas...LED sets use no gases to produce the image and for my green bottom dollar I love that!I watched Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope (Special Edition) from the latest DVD that hit the market back in say '07 or '08. It was the separate DVDs that contain the original theatrical release as well as the special edition versions. So, I was stunned at the clarity and definition in this piece. It's just amazing how that film has been preserved and remastered. Get this...it looked so good that I become somewhat disappointed about the soon be released Blu-Ray versions because I find it hard to believe that the resolution could look any better. I suspect what will be improved will be the motion capture that Blu-ray affords i.e. higher refresh rates. I wondered if my XBOX 360 has upconverting because that picture was just superb.My only complaint with the TV is the integration with my PC via my network. It requires a Samsung app to be used on the PC itself to act as a sort of virtual server. The file support was average to marginal and from what it seems like one has to load any content that one wants to stream on to this 'server' app which took a long time. Perhaps I'm missing something but I think not. I power down my PC (laptop) every day and so reloading into the server just to stream and then be denied because of the week file support? They can keep it. I'll just connect a thumb drive directly to the TV.For all you Samsung phone users you can turn your smartphone into a remote for the set. Cool, but not for me.Amazing TV and I'm thrilled with my purchase!

This problem seems to be intermittent to an extent, but it was definitely noticeable when I installed it and was running around Crackdown 2.  I haven't noticed it in simpler titles, but it is something that a gamer would notice.I found the initial set-up to be easy - this TV is light enough where a grown man should have zero problem attaching it to it's base; I don't use the menu or remotes much as I do all of my viewing through my X-box & streaming Netflix.I have no comment on the sound, as I have my Yamaha speakerbar.The one interesting thing I didn't realize is that everything except for the HDMI inputs have short adaptor cables that look plug into a 3.5mm headphone jack equivalent.  This includes RCA/Component, Co-axial, optical, etc...  it isn't an issue because they all fit behind the TV with zero difficulty, but it was something new to me.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture", "Author": "Transit \"Transit\"", "ReviewID": "R1MQ7I7H6PUOQU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the television for only a week, but I spent quite a bit of time doing a market survey for a television with the best picture before I purchased this one.  Samsung displays seem to be the best out there right now and the clarity of this television is stunning.  When watching Animal Planet, our cat is convinced that the animals on screen are real. I can well understand her reaction, as the picture is really that good.  The 3D capability works very well with the BCD-C6900 Samsung Blu-Ray player we purchased with the set. The 3D effect is good, but I'll have to reserve judgment on that until more 3D content becomes available.Other pluses; the set is very thin and works well with cabinets that have power lifts (we replaced a 25 yr old entertainment center with a cabinet with a power lift that conceals the TV when not in use.)The Internet capability is good, but needs more applications.  If you get the BD-C6900 Blu-Ray player, it has a built-in wireless link that works with the TV.  If you don't buy the Blu-Ray player, then you have to buy a separate Samsung wireless dongle/stick. I think that capability should be built into the set.The only con I have so far is the back lit Samsung label that is built into the frame of the television.  It goes off when the television is powered down, but while it is playing it is lit.  I really don't need that light on and find it distracting in low-light conditions.  I hope Samsung will make a future firmware upgrade that will give you the option to turn it off. (BTW, upgrading the software is simple.  Just download the file off the Samsung site to a USB memory stick and plug the USB into the TV, then select software upgrade).A pricey, but outstanding TV.

I was a little worried about purchasing this TV because of some of the reviews on Amazon, but most of them had to do with how the TV was shipped. You can fix that easy with (sorry Amazon I still love you) BestBuy. They will in fact price match with Amazon. I have taken advantage of this multiple times. Shipping worries solved. By the way. I did in fact purchase mine over Amazon and they delivered it with zero problems.A few of the connectors on the back require a dongle that come in the box. I'm not a fan of dongles and generally speaking I think dongles are a result of lack of engineering, but with a TV this thin I'll let it slide.Buy a wall mount. They ship a shoe string and some screws you can attach it too the wall with but seriously. Protect your investment and mount it up rock solid. Plus mounting the TV and having it free floating makes it look bigger. If you have small children a wall mount is an absolute must. Don't over think it just get one. You love your kid, you'll love this TV, do the right thing.If you don't have a sound system start planning for one. The TV sound is ok, but you can easily find yourself maxing out the volume just to get over a treadmill or something like like that.The \"online\" services are pretty much a joke. Just hook your computer/laptop up to it, but all they hype with the \"online\" services is just a gimmick.Make sure you have HD services with your cable TV.

It was a super sharp tv. One of their first 3d tvs and it did great. Picture quality was amazing. It was 240hz which helped with motion blur. For years it was great. Very sharp picture and all was grand for a while. At the time when I bought it they had a promo where you got the 3d starter kit ( 2 glasses and monsters vs aliens 3d) as well as a free 6900 3d bluray player. That samsung blu-ray player died after a year. Very disappointed, however I bought a new panasonic 3d blu-ray player. The new player was better, plus I got a free avatar 3d blu-ray which was awesome. I bought a 3d tv mainly to see that movie again in 3d and 3d gaming. Starting in January 2013 I started having a dim area in the lower right corner. It stayed that way for days. After a while it started to flicker in the corner as well. So 70% of the time it was normal, 20% of the time dim, and 10% of the time it flickered. I get migraines easily so the flicker was a problem. I called Samsung and of course it is out of warranty. I call a tech to come out and they said it was the panel. About $1300 to repair. $1000 for the part alone. I don't quite believe the tech since he never touched the tv or anything, just used a remote. The issue can clear up and start up if you swivel the tv. Probably a connection. I could have had someone come out and give me a second opinion or try and see if really is a cheaper part, but if that is wrong why waste more money when you can get a new tv for the cost of the repair. I know some may say this may be wear and tear, however this is in an entertainment center. Adult owned. And only moved about 10 times in it's life to update firmware or adjust hdmi connections. This was a great tv, but it has it's flaws. First, most 3d content is amazing but with my eyes I had to lower the 3d depth to about 10% to avoid any ghosting or crosstalk. It adds depth, but not a lot at that level. Also, some games like Motorstorm 3d on psn looked awful in the 3d. None of the depth settings could stop the crosstalk. That's rare though. I have 12 games that support 3d and only the motorstorm on psn gave me problems. Another thing I ran into was a motion flicker. Like blinds or fast moving scenes would cause some blurring or flicker in that area. You can fix that by turning off mpeg noise filter, but it still does it about 10% what it used to. This is a good tv, but the 3d was an early version and does have some compatibility issues. Not a lot, but they exist. Also, that motion flicker was annoying. Sd dvd playback was just ok. Kind of depends on your player, tv, size of tv, quality of the dvd bitrate, etc. On this tv compared to others I would give it a B- on dvd image quality. If you can get a deal on this tv I recommend it, however based on the build quality, motion blur, sd video quality, and some slight 3d issues I would only give it a B-. I spent $2300 on this tv back in 2010 and not only has tv gone bad, but the blu-ray player has went out. If you are reading this, I'm not saying Samsung is bad. I think they make some great tvs just like Panasonic. Just there's been some issues with how long they last. If you buy a samsung tv, buy an extended warranty and avoid spending over $1000 just in case you have an hardware trouble. Your milage may vary. Also, if anyone comments about 3d or picture quality I properly calibrated the tv with cnet settings as well as double checked them with my own calibration dvd.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice TV bad support", "Author": "Marvin S", "ReviewID": "R3VWHJ4P7ZQ70W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a Samsung 50 inch plasma nice picture until this TV failed it looked like the common problem with the cheap capacitors installed on their TV's.

First off, the design is very sleek and cool. Its brushed chrome with clear edges and is super thin. I cannot believe such a stunning picture comes out of something so thin and sleek. Speaking of picture, there are so many settings and options on this TV that its almost overkill. You can really customize your picture to your liking and then some. I found that this was the most difficult part of the TV. I spent 3 days calibrating the color/contrast/sharpness/brightness etc until I was pleased with it. There are many default settings but if you're like me, you know what looks right and what doesn't. After getting the calibration to my liking, everything you watch takes on a new life. What I mean is that shows and movies i've seen before look totally different with this TV.This TV has 240hz clear motion which adjusts things to move super smooth on the screen so you don't see any blur. Some might like it some might not. For some shows like cartoons, this doesn't work as well cause you see the picture jitter. There are settings to help fix this in the menu.it I watched Transformers and the robots looked amazing and the details were insane. Peoples faces show every zit, pore, imperfection it cracks me up how detailed the picture is. And Avatar on Directv was insanely beautiful.I've tried only a little bit in 3D and it is amazing. this tv came with the Shrek 3D series and all I can say is WOW. It was just amazing. I will say that the 3D is more of a depth thing rather than things flying off the screen at you. It also makes the picture look darker but no big deal. The glasses were comfortable and came in a nice pouch with a cleaning cloth. This TV also can make any show 3D with the touch of a remote control button. Again its more of a depth change than 3D.You can connect to some internet sites like Facebook, pandora and download apps. it also has Blockbuster and NetFlix so you can stream digital movies right to the TV. This TV has just about all the bells and whistles with a few silly exceptions. One of them is no built in wifi, so all that internet stuff you either need to spend more money on a USB wireless adapter or hardwire it to your router like I did. Another is the viewing angle isn't 178 like just about every other TV. You'll see color shifts when you sit or walk out of its viewing range. This TV is truly meant to sit right in front of to get the full effect. Also, you can't change the default input from TV to HDMI 1. Anytime you switch from watching a DVD it defaults to TV which is just static because its not hooked up to an antenna. The speaker is in the back of the tv but i didn't notice any sound issues.The remote control is cool and easy to use but my issue with it as well as the blu-ray dvd player's remote is the select/enter button is too small and right in the middle of the up/down/left/right selector buttons making it difficult to press. It also has a light up function that is cool but its not bright enough. The user manual doesn't explain many of the features well enough and to learn how and what features are/do you have to go in and try them. Another important thing to note is that this tv uses HDMI1.4 which is the latest version Most cables are 1.3. while they will work, you cannot use them to connect your 3D blu-ray player as it won't work. The 1.3 cables will work on everything else like satellite, cable, dvd, xbox, ps3 etc, just not 3D blu-ray players.This TV is definitely worth the money and you in my opinion are getting a state of the art TV.

I have netflix subscription, the picture quality in netflix is perfect HD even if the movie I watch is not HD. I use my external hard drive connected thru USB of TV to watch and listen movies and songs. Even with out a cable connection we can enjoy the TV using Internet. Internt @ TV is really a very good concept. The only bad thing is that the internet connection is wired. Such a High end TV has wired connection, it should be wireless. We can achieve that using a wireless adapter which costs $70 more. I purchased this with Kit which includes Blu-ray and 3d glasses. THe 3d glasses are very good. The bad thing is that we should change the bettaries if they are done. It would be good if they are rechargeable. We can buy 1 pair of rechargeable for $200, I will wait for the price drop and continue using the glasses provided by Samsung. There is no much thing to tell about the 3d blu-ray player. I have ordered the hdmi 1.4 cables PTC Premium Gold Series High Speed HDMI Cable, 6 feet (3-Pack). The 3d disc provided in the bundle is amazing and 3d view is eye catching. When we see the 3d picture it will be like seeing in real world. There are no words to describe the real 3d content of TV. There is a fake 3d content (convert 2d to 3d) which will not be good to see and you dont feel you are watching real 3d. Next regarding sound, If you are Music Lovers and If you want perfect sound it will be better to get a 3d surround Home theater system with Receiver. the sound output for TV is Just 20W.

Honestly, I could not care less about 3D in the home.  I think it's a fad.  I think it's annoying to have to wear glasses, and I think it's even more annoying that you can't change your focus while watching 3D content--i.e. if the scene is filmed to bring the foreground in focus, you can't take a quick look at the background (and vice versa).  So, when I first experienced this TV at a local store, it was set up as a 3D demo, and I wasn't very impressed.  Yes, it was nifty, but it wasn't for me.Well, about a month ago, I was killing time and wandered into the same store and was looking around at the various HDTV's.  I keep up on the state of things in the HDTV world, and check out the stores periodically just in case there is some really good deal.  And I was walking along, and, WOW! this set just really appealed to me.  Why?  Well, it was no longer the latest and greatest 3D Samsung and so had been taken off 3D demo and relegated to the area shared by all the other LCD sets.  And, also . . . and this is very important . . . one or more of the sales people liked this set and knew how to adjust it, and they did NOT have it in the STUPID \"demo\" mode where it is freaking MAXED out in contrast and brightness and has the highest \"smart LED\" setting and all that.  (The maxed out mode is called \"Dynamic\" in the picture settings, by the way.)  No.  They had it set to \"Movie\" mode.  And, OMG!  What a picture!  And it was an incredible deal.  Really really good because it was last years model and was a demo, already opened item.  I talked myself out of it that day.  Didn't need it.  Shouldn't really spend the money right then.  Etc.  But, I kept thinking about it and went back the next day and marveled once again at the incredible picture.  I also LOVED that the bezel is bushed stainless steel (or has that look, anyway).  Some people hate this.  I love it.  YMMV.  I also loved that it was .9 inches thick and only 50 pounds or so.  I did not love the glossy screen, and was worried about reflections in my living room, but even so, I also noted that this TV could really crank out the backlight brightness.  Didn't buy it that day either.  But I couldn't stop feeling that this was THE set for me, and that I would regret it if I didn't buy it.So I went back the day after that and bought it.  And let me tell you, after I tweaked the Movie settings a bit, I was just BLOWN AWAY by how awesome the picture was.  I am very, very happy with the picture quality of this TV.  I continue to marvel at it even a month later.  The one minor downside in this area is that the viewing angles aren't the best, as has been noted in professional reviews.  However, the thing is that it depends on what you mean by good viewing angles!  If what you want is a totally stable picture which shows absolutely NO change as you change your viewing angle, then, yes, this set has about a 45 degree range.  However, if you want to know over what range you still get a really good picture, that number is more like 90 degrees--i.e. you can be off axis by as much as 45 degrees and still have a picture which is every bit as good as perfectly on axis--or at least this has been my experience, and I just double checked it a minute ago.  The differences between reviewers may have a lot to do with how high the backlight is set.  The higher it is set, the less you will notice differences as you move across the viewing angles.  I still wish it were better in terms of viewing angle, but in practice, I never have ANY issues in this area, and our seating ranges as much as 45 degrees off axis.  The other thing that is mentioned in at least one professional review is that you \"can't turn off\" the smart LED / precision dimming--that even when you set the setting to \"off\" that this feature is still active to some degree.  Well, I think they must have changed the firmware since then such that OFF really does mean OFF.  My Oppo BPD-83 Blu-Ray player has a screen saver where the word \"Oppo\" bounces around on a black screen, and it is perfect for seeing just how much the smart LED is dimming down the backlight in columns of the screen without any bright pixels.  (This is what precision dimming does, by the way, and it does it top to bottom entirely, instead of, like the B8500, completely locally, around the bright object.  I think they changed this in order to avoid the \"halo effect\"; of course, now you have the \"waterfall effect\"  LOL!  I suspect that is preferable, however.)  And, when I turn OFF the smart LED, I don't see any difference from the blacks around the \"Oppo\" and the blacks elsewhere.  Personally, I find the smart LED to be a plus, in moderation.  I have mine set to standard, and yes, during credits or the screen saver, I do notice the waterfall effect, but during any actual scene, I never notice any artifacts from it and find that it improves the picture somewhat.  But, really, turn the thing completely off if you want--the picture will still be freaking incredible.  The people at Samsung may think that they need to crank everything up into \"Dynamic\" in order to WOW! and impress people in the store, but for me, the opposite is true.  I'm not impressed with stupidly vivid and unrealistic colors and contrasts.  Not at all.  If you DO like this, then this set will blow you away.  Just don't use the settings I'm going to list below.  Put it in standard or dynamic mode and play with the settings--there are a lot of settings to play with!Anyway, the point is, that I have yet to see any other LCD HDTV with a picture I like better than this Samsung.  It is, quite simply, breathtaking.  I love it.Now . . . the internet applications stuff in this set leave a LOT to be desired.  I was NOT impressed.  Streaming Netflix to the TV made me fill slightly ill due to the camcorder effect.  And I could not find any way to fix this in the settings, although I must admit that I didn't try very hard, because the internet stuff was glitchy as hell and seemed to destabilize the entire firmware!  I swear, the TV started acting up in all sorts of ways the second I hooked it up to the internet.  It would turn on, the picture would come on, and then it would turn completely off, and turn on again before it was happy, finally--and all this without me even thinking about pressing the internet button!  And turning on the internet was the same way.  I would turn it on, select Netflix, and it would start loading, and then crash out and I'd have to do it again.  Finally, I was like, screw this.  Not worth it.  Perhaps streaming video from Amazon would have worked better.  I don't know.  Maybe some day I'll try it again, but I doubt it.I mounted my set to the wall using the Samsung WMN1000B Fixed Low-Profile Wall Mount for Select Samsung 40-Inch to 55-Inch Displays and it is AWESOME.  I balked at the price at first, but then figured that I would pay it, but as luck would have it, it went on sale the very day I bought this set, so that was great.  The mount is literally a picture frame mount.  Two discs mount to the wall and then you attach two discs with a metal cable between them to the back of your Samsung, and two other discs at the lower left and right, and then you pick the set up and hang it on the wall exactly like a picture frame.  It is the COOLEST THING EVER, I have to tell you!  LOL!  Is the mount set up overpriced?  Yeah, probably.  Is it worth it anyway?  Yeah, I think so.OK.  Here are the settings that I have found are best for the most natural and faithful picture.  I arrived at these both by trial and error, and by using a Spears and Munsil calibration Blu-Ray disc and the very helpful RGB modes in Advanced Settings.  The backlight setting is something I adjust depending on whether it is day or night, hence the range of numbers.  Here they are:Mode: MovieBacklight: 13-20Contrast: 95Brightness: 42Sharpness: 0Color: 48Tint: G50/R50Eco Solution: Off/Off/OffAuto Adjustment: N/A (grayed out)Screen: N/AAdvanced Settings  Black Tone: Off  Dynamic Contrast: Off  Gamma: 0  Expert Pattern: Off  RGB Only Mode: Off  Color Space: Auto  White Balance: 25/25/25/25/25/25  10p White Balance: Off  Flesh Tone: Off  Edge Enhancement: Off  xvYcc: N/A  LED Motion Plus: CinemaPicture Options  Color Tone: Warm2  Size: 16:9  Digital Noise Filter: Off  MPEG Noise Filter: Off  HDMI Black Level: N/A (Low)  Film Mode: N/A (Off)  Auto Motion Plus: Off  Auto Protection Timer: 2 hours  Smart LED: StandardSo, in short, I can highly recommend this set.  I would definitely buy it for the price that Amazon is currently selling it for.  It has a few downsides, but for me the 2D picture quality more than makes up for these.  Oh, and one more thing: if you ever encounter some strange problems--like the set not wanting to turn off, or turning itself on, or whatever--then try holding down the \"EXIT\" button on the remote for about 10 seconds until it asks you if you want to reset all settings to factory defaults.  This will reset the firmware, and seems to be a good idea after upgrading the firmware, since doing this wipes out your settings anyway (so, yes, write them down!)", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Wish the Plug Was as Slim", "Author": "Kaorisdad", "ReviewID": "R2PWT832YZ7IHF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, a great TV.  Beautiful picture.  Off-angle viewing is a little bad.  Amazon was great and delivery was quick.My one gripe:  Be advised, if you plan to wall-mount this \"slim\" TV using the Samsung \"Ultra Slim-fit\" mount, that the plug is NOT slim and sticks out way past the mount.  I don't quite understand all the effort Samsung puts into making their TVs slim, but the plug is huge and protrudes way past the wall mounts.  Why don't they just have a flat plug end, like some of the plugs on appliances?  You either have to set the outlet into the wall, or add spacers, or wood blocking to have the TV lie reasonably flat on the wall.  Adding spacers or wood blocks defeats the whole purpose of the slim-fit mounts.  I had to block the mounts off the wall or my TV was sitting on the plug, angled up from the bottom and rotated slightly off-center.

I'm going to try to give you some practical information that isn't in the specs. I read all the specs myself but was still knocked out when I actually had the tv in front of me. I knew I was going to buy a Samsung when I had to get a new tv but I wasn't expecting to need one a month before Christmas. My Sony XBR had been the top of the line model when I bought it, paying over $2000 10 years ago for a 300 pound 32in box. Unfortunately, since then my mother bought a Sony Wega which lasted about 2-3 years before the picture went. I thought I was in trouble a couple of years ago when my picture turned purple one day and the tv refused to turn on. When a repairman finally came weeks later I hit power to show him the problem and it turned on perfectly. What a lovely waste of money. This time, it did what my mother's had done-started blinking randomly, then so much it was unwatchable. Since I had been looking at the new lcd and plasma tvs since helping my mother find her new tv  last year and Samsungs always had the best picture, with the Sharp Aquos a close second. I resolved myself to the fact that I had to shell out the cash before Christmas and looked everywhere at every tv imaginable. I heard horror stories from other previous Sony owners. The Vizio seemed improved from its earlier models but I just couldn't get the image of all the Vizios returned to Sam's Club on pallets after Christmas, and Costco had changed their return policy specifically because they got so many Vizio returns. (I know someone reading this has a Vizio and will be offended by this but it's the truth, they only sell so many because they are dirt cheap) I saw the Samsung 9000 model and couldn't believe how thin it was and the remote was great. The only problem was the price, about another $500, and when I went on Samsung's website and called their technical support I was told the 8000 was actually a better tv. It took a week to disassemble my goliath Sony piece by piece to make it light enough to carry out from the second story and about 10 minutes to get the Samsung up the stairs, out of the box, in the stand, and plugged in to cable. The picture is amazing. The movie that happened to be on when I hit the power button was 2012. We were blown away. It actually felt like you were in the movie, in the RV running from a meteor shower, in the cockpit of the plane. A shot of a hand holding a phone was so clear I could see every single line and swirl in the fingerprints! It was so weird...it looked 3D and it was just on its regular picture! We've had it set up for a few days now and we are still amazed when watching it. Some people have gotten nauseous standing too close because its so realistic. Even the non-HD channels look good. My blueray player hasn't been delivered so I haven't watched anything 3D, but I've seen demos. The 2D to 3D feature works well and the picture was so easy to set up. It took about a minute to get it connected to the wi-fi. The remote and menu are extremely easy to use. The stand is a little large but hey, who is looking at the stand? It holds the tv and it swivels, although you can see a great picture from any angle. The brushed platinum finish is beautiful. It has great extras like an ambient light sensor. If you turn your lights off when watching tv at night you can set it to automatically dim. You can bring up a mini-menu to change picture modes without going through the menu. Another feature that is terrific for me is the sleep timer. You can set it to turn off at the same time every night, which is perfect for me because I often fall asleep watching tv. For earth-friendly people it has 2 extra eco modes to conserve energy. It will turn off automatically if the cable goes out and it gets no signal. The apps that come with the TV are Hulu Plus, Vudu HD, Netflix, ESPN, Yahoo, CinemaNow, Facebook, Napster, SpsTv, and TED. More will be available in 2011, and of course you can add as many as you want to download now from the Samsung website. Vudu gives you a free movie and I couldn't believe it but right after midnight on the day of its release a brand new movie was available, before I could even go to a store and buy or rent it. I know its 240HZ but so far nothing has run faster than 60HZ. I haven't tried any gaming systems on it yet but I'm planning on being freaked out by the Zombies in Dead Rising 2 and I can't imagine a driving game. I'll have to play Resident Evil 5 again because it is going to be a totally different game on this TV. It has exceeded my expectations in every way. I could even use it as a monitor on my network if I wanted to see this review on a 46in screen. I know that you can read a whole bunch of technical reviews but I hate not getting the real info I need to make a decision to buy something. Why give a product 1 star because you got a lemon and needed to get it replaced? Everyone has purchased something at some point and it didn't work right and you had to exchange it for another. Yes, its a hassle when you're talking about something that costs as much as an LED tv, but still, 1 star when you have nothing bad to say about the picture quality or features? The only tiny, tiny feature I would say could be improved is the sound, but that is an exchange you make for getting a tv that is thinner than a mans thumb. Theres simply no room for a giant subwoofer! The speakers are on the back of the TV instead of the front or sides like older models. That said, I don't have any qualms about the sound. It gets extremely loud and can be easily heard on a setting of 1. Its not an mp3 player it's a tv! If I had the money I would replace all my TVs with these LED Samsungs. I would hang one on my living room wall and run it on the network as a giant ever-changing art gallery. BTW, don't pay extra to have someone come and \"calibrate\" your tv. It is so unnecessary. The plug and play picture was almost perfect and Samsung provides 2 patterns on it's picture menu to set up the brightness and color scheme. I know that when I was reading reviews and making my decision to purchase this tv a lot of people knocked the remote. Don't believe it. The remote is simple and intuitive. I was actually so knocked out by the remote for the 9000 model that I asked Samsung if it would work on the 8000 and found out it would. I was able to purchase it as an extra for much less than the cost of upgrading to the 9000 series, which has a lower dynamic picture ratio and its only plus over the 8000 is that it is only about as thick as 5 credit cards. Otherwise it is the same platinum finish on the outside. Now, the reason I wrote so much about my Sony problems at the beginning is because Sony has this reputation, and in my opinion, and a certain website I found with over 47 pages (yes pages, not  47 individual complaints) of complaints about Sony tvs asking for a class action suit against the company, Sony is overrated. While shopping I ran into several people looking at new tvs who said that it seemed like their Sony had been programmed to die as soon as the extended warranty expired. I have a 20in Magnavox that is 22 years old and still has a great picture and sound, a 9in Philips over 10 years old that amazed my 16yr old (who couldn't get over the fact it was \"year 2000 ready\") because he was expecting some kind of toy instead of a great picture when I had to use it after my Sony died and I was waiting for this Samsung to arrive. Oh to be young and naive...! I am staying away from Sonys from now on. My XBR was supposed to be the best of the best and ok, the picture was good-while it lasted. I don't have a lot of money but I have expensive taste and spending this much on a tv was not easy. I did a LOT of research and looked at everything from Plasma to LED and tried to figure out if my tv could be fixed before having to replace it. Nothing came close to this Samsung. Since my one vice as a 39yr old woman is watching too much tv and playing video games I highly recommend it. But I am getting a 5yr warranty just in case. This was an investment and I hope it pays off. One more thing, don't forget to buy your link stick for the networking. The upgraded remote I purchased (model RMC30C2) also connects to the network and if you don't want to pause your tv you can switch the picture to watch it on the remote and carry it around with you from room to room. It is a little harder to set up but I have to admit I didn't read the directions. sI have a DVR but this feature is still neat because the tv is in my bedroom. Also, Amazon won't like this but shop around for a warranty. Prices vary greatly from company to company and if you want it directly from Samsung it is renewable, Square Trade is not. As an Amazon positive they had the best price for the 3D package, especially considering it was tax-free. This was long but I hope I have provided someone with the information they need to make a decision about what to buy.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "samsung c8000 series 3d lcd led backit tv", "Author": "Chad W.

Bawol", "ReviewID": "R1YXFJRBTNWJBB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV in December 2010 after doing quite a bit of research on the 46\" TV offerings at that time.The form factor of the TV itself is very nice, it is a good looking set and mounts easily to a wall or on top of an entertainment cabinet.The potential to be a great TV exists, however Samsung dropped the ball on their hardware.  I've had to completely reset all settings on the TV twice now due to HDMI problems with the main board.  This seems to be somewhat common from what I've read online, this is also where I found out how to reset the TV to fix the problems.For the first year of it's life the TV was hooked up to my router through a network cable and there were no network connectivity problems, in the house I'm in now the unit resides approximately 8 feet away from the wireless (G/N) router and now we have issues.  Once the Samsung wireless USB adapter connects it streams things like Netflix, Hulu, and even local TVersity media servers okay, however the TV requires more than a couple/few minutes to load up before the Wireless connection works, this I find unacceptable as you should not even be able to access the @InternetTV applications without a network connection.  Whenever I want to watch something streaming online or on my local network media share I have to consciously turn the TV on a few minutes before I want to actually browse to the movie/show/music so by the time the WiFi is connected, the fact that my wireless USB headphones for my computer work within seconds of plugging in my USB receiver for it leads me to believe that Samsung cheaped out on their USB WiFi adapter or the hardware that handles the USB peripherals.On the Internet TV subject, Samsung decides to arbitrarily install web apps for you seemingly at their own will, which really stinks since I've programmed my Logitech Harmony remote to perform certain steps to start up things like Netflix, Skype, etc.  So when Samsung installs these new apps it also feels compelled to re-arrange my internet app icons, thus messing with my Harmony remote macros requiring remote re-programming.  This is awful on many levels, first of all they install apps for no reason, second of all they don't give you control over placement of the app icons within the Internet Apps menu.The BIG issue I've had (that I've considered contacting Samsung about) is the HDMI problems.  Something happens where all of my HDMI components (stereo, XBOX 360, Zune HD, etc.) stop interacting with the TV, unplugging and plugging back in has no effect, it causes all HDMI components to fail, and as a result I have to do a hard reset of the TV (which means all of my menu customization is gone.)  This along with the poor Wireless USB adapter performance and awful internet app functionality is why I'm giving this 3 stars.Don't get me wrong, as long as the HDMI problem doesn't rear it's ugly head again I'm content with this TV, the picture quality is great, the technical capabilities (when working) are all that I could ask for, and quite frankly with the poor WiFi connectivity I don't even use my Harmony remote macros due to the lag in even being able to access the Internet functionality.If I were able to sell it and not lose too much money I probably would, but based on what I paid for it and the fact that I can install new internet apps and use Skype etc. it will work just fine.If you are looking for a cutting edge TV that can bridge the gap between traditional broadcast entertainment and the internet then this is not necessarily the TV you are looking for, if you don't mind some wireless speed shortcomings (even though the functionality is there once it finally loads up) and you want a TV with a great picture and fairly flexible settings then it might be worth a shot as long as you don't pay too much for it.I know it seems contradictory but if I were asked the question \"would you buy it again?\" I would probably answer \"no,\" however it has served me well (all things considered) and coming from the TV I had before this was a significant upgrade.  I've been using computers for quite some time and maybe that is why I'm rather numb to this sort of shortcoming, it's sad that this is what it has come down to (knowing that rebooting an operating system to get it to work is \"normal\" for example.)", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little TV- if you don't want Amazon Instant Video", "Author": "cwhite4455", "ReviewID": "R2AGXHGTTRQ3QO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is great- if you can get around the Amazon Instant Video problems.  For me, anyway, I had to restart TV twice in ten days as Amazon App failed to load.  The app is really garbage as it is part of the yahoo suite and it takes like ten clicks to get out and around in the app. Poor organization when you are in- compare the organization to Netflicks and you will see the weaknesses.  I've given up calling in as Amazon CS agents just forward complaint to technical people with no solution- waste of time.  I've uninstalled app and re-installed and I'll see if that helps- self help here as no help from Amazon.  App hasn't crashed yet- but it has only been less than a day.Samsungs are way too expensive.  I got lucky through amazon warehouse deals on this set. I purchased as new through Amazon Warehouse Deals for 891.  It was new- all the film was still on it and all the accessories were still in the bags.  You can count on an as new description from Amazon as being accurate as the 64gb playbook I purchased for 226 was also unopened.  In my opinion, when given the choice between like new and anything else, it's worth getting a like new one.Updating the firmware and software took some restarts and a reset for Netflix to work.  When watching Netflix or streaming video, the screen flickers once every minute or so- for just a fraction of a second.  Doesn't bother me too much.  The Apps, while better then Sony still kinda suck.  BBC News App is totally screwed.  Why does Samsung allow crap like that?The thing looks great in my bedroom.  I also have a Sony kdl-60nx810 in my living room.  There are some minor clouding issues on the Samsung that just aren't present on the Sony.  In addition, some of the presets on the Samsung are way, way too bright. I also have a several year old top of the line 32 Sharp \"gaming\" LCD TV that my son is stuck with.  I really think it has more room for picture adjustment than this mighty 8000 series has.  My Sony led has slightly less \"room\" for adjustment than this Samsung has, but the image, when properly calibrated, is better than this 8000 series.I use my ipod touch as a keyboard via Samsung's remote app in itunes.  It makes surfing youtube a breeze. The sound on the 8000 is great for a thin TV- much better than the Sony.  However, I use external speakers through cheap optical cables. I opted to run an ethernet cable toit as the wi-fi dongle is a costly item and wires are always good and cheap.  I understand Rosewill makes a dongle that's available for around 20 for those interested in that route.Most of the professional settings I have found for this Samsung were the lifeless plasma movie settings- not my cup of tea.  I have  found one setting here on Amazon from a user for the Samsung that is pretty decent.... edit.... (actually, the settings found here on Amazon are pretty amazing if watching 1080p.) I have watched some sample videos on the tv from my win 7 computer with these settings and the quality is SUPERB.  However, I do not have the right format videos on my CPU for the most part.  It's REAL pain to make videos compatible if they aren't already.  I'd rather spend my time writing stupid tv reviews on Amazon instead.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super Happy with Purchase", "Author": "CJ \"cjad19\"", "ReviewID": "R27X2UXKCAX94C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for over 1 year and it is very nice.

I did notice some issues with the speakers when watching Inception - when the sounds got loud/high I had a lot of distortion and feedback.  I have not checked other films, etc. so it may be from the Blue-Ray disc itself but I thought I'd mention it.Also, if you plan to use it on its stand, be aware the speakers are on the back of the set and so the sound travels out the back and needs to bounce back off walls, etc. to get to the front.  This was an issue for us as the setup had the sound going upstairs before bouncing off a wall to return and so the sound had to be turned up to hear in front  of the TV but the folks upstairs were getting it much louder.Overall, it is a great TV, just watch out for placement if on a stand and check those high/loud parts to see if the speakers are an issue.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful TV", "Author": "Daniel P.

It's last year's model, but after all the reviews I've read, I didn't see anything that justified the much larger price tag to buy a 2011 model.  The product was delivered on-time and in a clean package.  The TV picture (after using CNet setting recommendations to calibrate) is fantastic!  The new firmware must have cut down on 3D crosstalk issues I've read, because I haven't noticed that so far.  The colors POP, the blacks are great for an LED and it's just so dang thin and energy efficient!I do have a 2011 Panasonic Viera TV in the basement and after spending time with this one, I just really enjoy the vibrant picture so much more than the plasma (especially being in a room where more light comes in.  I really like the chrome bezel and it virtually disappears once the lights are out and you're watching a movie.There are some flaws to be noted.  One, the viewing angle (although not unwatchable by any stretch) is not the greatest.  Once you move to the side, the picture gets a bit washed out.  This is a huge advantage with Plasmas (and even other LCD's) out there.  Second, it has some great internet connected features, but unless you have a LAN you'll have to purchase Samsung's Wi-Fi dongle.  Third, the remote sucks.  It looks cool, but you literally have to look down at it every time you want to change the volume/adjust settings/etc.  Finally, no 3D glasses included and the new 2011 Samsung TV's use Bluetooth not IR for connectivity, so it's hard to find good Samsung 3D glasses at reasonable prices because they are no longer using this technology.  However, you can find great and affordable 3rd party glasses that work great (See Xpand X103)At the end of the day, we are very pleased and I recommend this product (for its price) any day....", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic viewing", "Author": "JHP", "ReviewID": "RK2NWU15O7CBZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We researched this tv set and watched for good pricing.

The picture is stunning, and its worth the money.The biggest issue for me is that the ARC (Audio Return Channel), for external sources such as a cable box, only outputs 2.1 stereo to my 5.1 speaker setup instead of the full 5.1 channels.  This is a software/firmware issue with the TV that Samsung has deliberately created, I suspect for copy protection reasons.  When using the TV for Netflix though, it does output the full 5.1 channels over the ARC, so I know it's not a hardware issue.  For most people this probably won't be much of an issue, but if you intend on using the ARC feature this could get annoying.Also, I wanted to use Ethernet over HDMI, a feature which HDMI 1.4 supports.  This TV supports HDMI 1.4 so in theory it should support Ethernet over HDMI, but I could not find any documentation or support on the issue.  It seems as if the TV doesn't support it.

It does seem like you are actually on the set of the show you are watching!Unlike others, I got this TV to replace an old bulky 32 inch boob tube TV that I had for 8 years!  This is basically the most technologically advanced thing that has ever been in my home.  The difference between my old TV and the Samsung is like the difference between DOING the Moonwalk and actually WALKING on the Moon!And I haven't even added any peripherals yet!  I scrapped up the money to buy the TV and have just been blown away with the prescence of it in my living room and I bought a whole new entertainment center to put it in of course!!  I find myself looking at it even when it is off!  The chrome four leg stand, the brushed aluminum look to the edge, highlighted with the clear edge, the ease with which it swivels, the weight of it and the \"How did they do that?!\" thinness!! 1.1\" OMG, you gotta be kidding!  Yet it has connections on the back that I will not understand for ten years probably!I insisted on a TV with 240hz vs. 160hz and I am glad I did, it makes all the difference.Future plans:1) Just ordered a micro hdmi to hdmi cable so I can get my droid X in on the fun!  Can't wait to see the videos of my son playing baseball and some vacation videos I have stored on my Droid.2) Today I will probably order a Samsung 3D 6900 Blu Ray player.  I almost ordered a Linkstick but the cost of it is at least $60 and the 3D Blu Ray can probably be bought for just under $200 and it already has the Linkstick included.  Just got my computers hooked up to a wireless modem so I cannot wait to sync everything together and I am finally coming out of the dark ages, throwing away my Blockbuster and HollyWood Video member cards (remember those!?), and signing up for NetFlix!!3) Lastly, I am going to order a Bose Cinematic sound system sometime this year to polish off the experience.My only complaint is the weak sound from the built in speakers.  I guess when you only have an inch to work with, then the sound will not be too good.  The Bose should solve that.  I have not adjusted any picture setting and it just seems perfect.  Probably because my old TV, affectionately refered to by my kids as \"Old Sucky\" was so....well...old and sucky!  I probably don't know the difference!

I sit 15 feet away from the screen because of how our living room is built. This tv is very easy to see at this distance, I was afraid I should have gone to the 55 inch model, but it was 50% percent more than what I paid for this tv. The tv is so much more clear, the black levels are great and the colors are good once you tune it. I went and googled this tv and found some good video settings from CNET. I was able to get the bundle with a free samsung blu ray player and a free starter kit. They talk to each other, it's great. My only gripes with the tv is the placement of the inputs, lack of wireless built in, and the auto-dimming feature. They are too close to the edge of the tv, and if you have thick cables like mine, they stick out past the edge of the tv. Samsung needs to include 90 degree adapters or move the location of the inputs. Not to mention I could barely get my hdmi cable in, the inputs are mounted almost too shallow. On the auto dimming, everytime I turn off a few lights in the house, the tv automatically dims. That wouldnt be a problem if it dimmed a little, but its so much darker, I have to go into the menu and change the video settings every single time I turn down the lights. I'm sure theres got to be a setting somewhere to turn this off. Just a minor inconvenience. Lastly, the wireless feature, I researched before I bought the tv, so I knew it did not have one...but how is it that my 200 dollar nintendo wii has it built in but my 1600 dollar tv doesnt have it? Stupid peripherals. I simply moved my modem and wireless router behind the tv and wired it in. Works great! The ability to use the DLNA feature to stream videos from my android phone is awesome, the ability to watch youtube from the tvs software without a computer or using my wii is even better! I purchased my cable and swivel wall mount from monoprice dot com. Bought them for about the same amount as on here, but the search function for the wall mounts on here is horrible. I spent half an hour on amazon trying to find the right mount. I gave up and went to monoprice. The 3d function is cool, I watched it for a couple of minutes using one of the free shrek 3d blu rays I received with the starter kit. Its cool, I cant wait to watch something more cool with it.

I returned it and decided to upgrade to a Sony Bravia kdl-46nx711. Now this was a gorgeous screen and the tv was sexy. However, the main reason I purchased it was for the 3D feature. It was pretty bad. Crosstalk, ghosting, was a huge issue with the Sony. I brought it back right away and received a full refund. I then researched a bit more and seen that some thought the Samsung was the best choice. Amazon had a bundle deal for the holidays that I couldn't pass up. Let me tell you I got an amazing deal on the bundle. So the 3D works quite a bit better on the Samsung then it did on the Sony. The crosstalk was pretty minimal and tolerable when it did occur.

Even without 3D capabilities - I just loved the looks of it as well as the picture quality - plus the internet apps (Netflix, Hulu plus, Vudu, Yahoo widgets etc.). The 3D capability is an added bonus for a couple of hundred dollars more - and a steal with the 3D Blu-ray player and the 3D starter kit bundled in free at the same price.We have watched a few 3D movies in the last week. 3D looks great, very immersive experience even for a 46\" display. The 2D --> 3D conversion for regular programming is also pretty impreseive and I am sure will improve with the next versions and as technology evolves.  Internet apps work great - especially love Netflix and Yahoo widgets. Facebook interface sucks - and basically no good.Setting up a Samsung Apps account is very confusing. No clear instructions on where to go and register. You have to go to the Samsung apps home page on the Internet (AND on your PC - not the TV itself) - and register your TV, create your profile and add your credit card to activate your account. The manaul for the TV itself is also very basic and doesn't explain all the features and options in detail. Samsung could have done a better job with it.I have it mounted on the wall with the Samsung ultra low profile mount. Very easy to install and mount (under 30 minutes) and the TV just sticks to the wall like a wall painting..with very little clearance between the wall and the TV. Keep in mind - if you are also plugging in a Samsung USB wireless LinkStick (wifi Lan adapter) - there is not enough space/clearance between the wall and TV and the Linkstick rubs against the wall (atleast in my case).Overall - very happy and satisfied with this TV.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "SAMSUNG 47 INCH TV", "Author": "Simply Dolling \"\"movie Lover\"\"", "ReviewID": "R2SFT7SWHXAREQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BEAUTIFUL PICTURE...MAKES EVERTHING LOOK LIKE BLU-RAY.

You can do a lot with the TV and the apps bring a whole new level.My favorite part about this TV is just how black the blacks are when watching a movie.  I haven't seen videos look this good ever.Just make sure you spend the time to get the picture to look right, otherwise your results will vary (when I first got the TV, everything looked like a spanish soap opera due to the 240 hz) so it pays to read up.Bottom Line:This is the best TV you can get at the best price right now.  3d is still new, so maybe next year changes will happen and maybe a better TV will come out with better 3d support.  I wouldn't buy this TV just for 3d support (though I can't lie, I'm looking forward to playing 3d games on my ps3 now with it), instead I would buy this tv because the picture is the best you can get.Blacks are black, the sound is very clear and the video quality is to die for, the pictures look so vivid and life like it's better than being there.My favorite feature for this tv isn't skype (which is just awesome), it's not hulu or netflix (again, amazing), nor the ability to plug in a usb hard drive or a USB thumbstick and watch videos off it, nor is it the fact that the TV puts off very little heat, uses little power, and features little to no glare.Nope, my favorite feature is something that might be overlooked by many people, it's the optical audio out.  This means I can use HDMI on every device I hook up to the tv, and output the audio from my TV.This isn't important if you're using surround sound (which I only can on select days), but it is important if you're going to output the audio to a virtual surround sound headset (like those from Turtle Beach or Astro) which I have to use to fully enjoy sound in my apartment (due to the neighbors complaining about loud explosions, screams, and other mayhem...)By having the optical built into the TV, it eliminates a lot of cables and devices.  No longer do I need to switch optical cables each time I go to a different source, everything is handled by the tv.  If I want to output to the tv and not the headset?  Just change the option in the menu and you're good to go.This is a well thought out TV that offers premium features at a decent price.  It really delivers a great viewing experience.

Not the complete quality of 3D but you certainly get a 3 dimensional feeling when watching. I would highly recommend the tv and the package of all three items.
