The 22\" picture is great for a medium size room.I read numerous reviews on 19\" TV's and found them to be lacking in one feature or another, I was suprised to see the 22\" Haier model so I though I would Try it.Works for me!", "Date": "October 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good TV, Good Price", "Author": "Ben L", "ReviewID": "RWNT8KQUU0Q45", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have owned this tv for 3 weeks.
