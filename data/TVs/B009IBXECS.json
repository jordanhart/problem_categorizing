What interested us:* 120Hz refresh rate* Wi-Fi built in* LED screenSet up was very easy. The TV found our secure wireless SSID and it took maybe 15 seconds to have it connected to our home network. I wish the TV connected over the 5G band instead of the 2G but we haven't experienced any lag with Amazon Prime or Netflix.Connecting the TV to our home entertainment center was easy with the HDMI cable (not included). Our Harmony remote took about 2 minutes to update and was controlling the television soon after.Colors look bright and blacks are very black. I've tested the TV with our Blu-Ray player, HD programming via DirecTV, games from our Xbox 360, and movies from our Apple TV. No complaints from any source and the images look very sharp with excellent colors.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "VIZIO is setting a new standard for excellence at a bargain price", "Author": "Expressed Reviews \"Expressed Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R1J1WSYGIVKZI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the course of the past 2 years; we've replaced all of our TV's with those manufactured by Vizio. Our first HDTV was a Samsung 40\" that we purchased in 2007. Recently, a problem developed in one of the circuit boards, rendering the picture unwatchable. Since new TV's have come down so much in price; it wasn't worth spending the money to fix it. I've been so pleased with the performance of our other Vizio TV's, that I decided to purchase this one. Our Samsung fit into a cabinet that we wanted to use for our new Vizio, and we found that since the actual size of the TV is about the same as the Samsung; it fits into the cabinet perfectly. We also get an additional 2\" of screen, which makes a difference. Setting up this TV is a breeze, and to say that I'm satisfied with its performance would be an understatement. What I especially like is the ability to watch football games without having to see a blur when the players are running down the field. I'm no expert when it comes to technology, but I think that this has something to do with the increased refresh rate over older model TV's. All I know is that the picture is magnificent and crystal clear, the speakers are decent(I'll be connecting my own), and the Internet Apps are out of this world. It takes just a few minutes to set up a wireless Internet connection, and once done: you have access to an endless array of movies, TV shows and apps from many different sources. I'm so impressed with this TV that I have nothing negative to say about it. It has everything that I was looking for, was easy to set up, and works flawlessly. I couldn't ask for anything more.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Robert A. Cotterman-nelson \"Robert C\"", "ReviewID": "R27Q2G5XI7BRDB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First I want to say the CONs.1. It is LED-LCD Which means black levels are not that great. It is an amazing picture, and the contrast is great, but the black levels are sub par compared to my old 720 plasma. But that is expected.2. The Sound, It is ok. you can deal but it is nothing to call mom about, I wouldnt buy this by it self. Either spend a bit more on a tv with amazing sound, or spend the money on a sound bar. The sound works, and the surround sound understanding and output is good. (you can hear the birds in the background on avatar etc..) but its just 2 measly 8w speakers.3. The setup. OMG it takes for ever to figure out, and if you dont know what you are doing, it takes way too long. I will share my set up later.Now for the PRO's1. Price. 499+Tax for 42 inches with 120hz and 1080p... Phenomenal.2. Picture detail. The detail (when set up) is superb. At least when matched with a blu ray quality movie. Gamer(the movie) just rocks your socks off.3. Features for price. The features are awesome. The one con is no blue-tooth and no keyboard remote. I dont use the remote to type much, but when I do I wish i had the keyboard for that. I'd recommend the m420sl model by them for 50$ more. However you lose back lit LED for the Edge lit in the m420sl. Anyhow this tv has truvolume which is awesome for movies at night, or around sleeping babies, and or commercial blares. However it doesnt pass through the optical out. So if your sound system doesnt have truvolume, it's a lost feature. The apps are fun, and neat. They load fast enough, and respond 99-100% of the time. Netflix takes a bit to load, but when searching you can hit left right up and down and even if it pauses for a second, all your button presses were registered. (my blu ray player bdp2900/f7 has the slowest netflix on earth).... HDMI CEC is awesome, i have never had it in a set up before, and it is amazing. Controlling the blu ray player with the tv remote is so easy to set up, and it rules! Now just to buy a sound bar with HDMI ARC...Additional Info...Setup.My setup is along the following lines.Backlight (as low as you can handle)Brightness - 42 (minimum my tv goes before losing black detail)Contrast - 67 (max my tv goes before losing white detail)Color  - 60Tint - 0Sharpness - 9Advanced colors - custom - all at 50. (for vibrance)otherwise i put it on natural and left it. you dont notice, and it seems more real after you get use to itLuma to strong or extend.MPG NR - offNoise reduction - offColor to color rich.Film mode to auto (this ensures 24hz is seen) (my bluray player is best at 1080p NOT 1080p/24hz the first removes all judder)im not set on smart dimming yet, i think i prefer it on. But on can incur mild flashing. Off is more \"stable\" or \"consistent\"and auto backlight off.Here is a forum I found judder test files. [...]Just placed em on a thumb drive or hard drive I attached to my blu-ray player and tweaked all the settings until 30 and 23.976 both \"panned\" smoothly. If they are hopping every couple frames.

If you're not tech geek or just need a sharp looking LED with some fancy apps then stop reading and go get the thing.BUT, if you want more from it then keep reading.Vizio really is dropping the ball with their app selection and some apps are pure garbage.  The apps are bulky - difficult to navigate and on top that unresponsive more often than not.  The Youtube app is atrocious and isn't worth much at all.  Most content is blocked to be viewed on the display and the search ability is terrible.  The Vimeo app seems to an afterthought and is 100% trash, don't even open it.  The Hulu app lags, lags, and lags some more making it frustrating beyond belief.  Their is no internet browser....Very Lame.  And Yahoo being in cahoots with the company makes the light at the end of the tunnel looking mighty dim.PROS- The Price!- Looks Great- Picture is Top notch- USB?- It has Apps....- Remote is cool when it's responsiveCONS- Garbage Apps- LAG- LAG- Keep waiting for those Apps to load", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's No Samsung But Great For The Price", "Author": "Cautious Consumer \"Cautious Consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R228X1ZKRHFD5O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If money was of no concern, I'd have purchased a Samsung. But I was limited this year like so many others. I found that this particular Vizio had everything I was looking for at a reasonable price. Yes I do know that all the manufacturers will be soon coming out with even better features BUT, you buy what you buy when you need it most. A resister went out on my older set and I had no other screen to watch. But I did my research none the less and finally found this out of so many versions. It fit my budget and the quality of the picture can't be beat at this price. With WiFi to boot, I can watch NetFlix and save a bundle over the cost of Satellite or Cable TV packages. I do find however that I must turn off the power and back on again when I loose my wifi signal. This isn't a Vizio only problem as I do it for my Samsung Bluray as well. Perhaps if I had a direct cable to the units it wouldn't be a factor. Nevertheless, best Vizio version for the money!-Update 1/22/2013-I understand why some people rated this item very low. It is because they did not really try to intelligently adjust the picture which can take a very long time (days of experimentation). Why not just try the settings people have published here. I did, and was shocked that I thought I now had a far more expensive tv. Shocked that Vizio doesn't make factory settings better *must be a reason??? My only personal comparison is my friend's 60\" Samsung where you actually see pores in people's skin which is just too freaky for me to enjoy in some movies. But after making the changes as noted by another reviewer here, my smaller 42\" screen looks as good as my friend's 60\" theater set. He spent three weeks experimenting on his Samsung's picture settings and is now very happy. I suggest everyone here do the same because this Vizio is quite capable!", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "All the features I'd been waiting for, gorgeous & smart!", "Author": "Bectile \"bectile\"", "ReviewID": "R3PWJHE54WX5T2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did not buy this from Amazon because they were out of stock at the time (December) but I wanted to review it here because I am absolutely in love with my TV and want to defend it against the poor reviews I see on here. :)I purchased this TV to replace an aged LCD flatscreen and was looking for a lot of features, including LED backlighting for energy efficiency, lightweight to mount on the wall, high refresh rate, smart dimming, customizable settings, and the ability to play Netflix. I found all this and more with this TV.One important thing to note when adjusting the picture settings is that the TV will have different advanced settings for EACH MODE. You need to edit the advanced settings for each mode while using that mode. Yes this may be a pain, but it can be a bonus, because the cable TV input may look much different than the Blu-ray, etc, and you can make a mode for each one.The picture does need adjusting to really POP.. the default settings are a bit washed-out. I used the movie \"Princess Bride\" to play with the settings, and I read other people's recommendations. I started with \"Movie Mode\". I found that turning OFF the ambient light sensor immediately improved the picture. I set the \"Adaptive Luma\" setting to \"Strong\" which deepens the dark areas providing more contrast. And I changed the \"Color Enhancement\" to \"Rich color\" which made skin tones warm and more alive.I changed the \"Color Temperarure\" to \"Cool\" because it was a bit TOO warm but then I thought it was a bit too green, so I made my own custom Color Temperature: Red Gain 42, Green Gain 45, Blue Gain 50, Red Offset 55, Green Offset 50, Blue Offset 50.I was happy to have so many options, the Picture settings are extremely customizable so I don't see why people can't get what they want. Please feel free to try my settings and see if it helps with flesh tones and colors in general. I consider these adjustments a \"work in progress\" and I plan to play with each input having a mode to suit it.The sound is great, by the way. I have it set on surround and it is pretty rich. I swear it has directionality and is much  better than other flat screens I've listened to.I set up the Wi-fi but have a LAN connection so I don't use it and can't review its stability or speed. My only real complaint about this TV is it seems a little slow to connect to the input you select, having to gather information first before showing a picture. The split second delay is something I'm not used to, never having had an HDMI connection before. It may be my old cables, but not worth replacing them.In summary, I've had this TV for a month and have been watching all my old favorite movies on it, and it makes me feel like I'm in a theater again! Netflix, blu-ray and my digital tuner are all gorgeous on it. Netflix loads much quicker than my old bluray player's interface, by the way. I'm really happy with this TV and have enjoyed customizing the settings to my liking.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!", "Author": "DMarie", "ReviewID": "R3RZ48HF58LV86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To say I am extremely satisfied with this tv is an understatement.

Angel", "ReviewID": "R1NGKRD0QOU4GP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nearly every 120Hz LED has smooth motion capabilities. Sure, not everyone likes it, but it's possible to make it optional on most 120Hz HDTVs. This TV abandons that entirely. No option for the end user making the TV act like a 60Hz TV.Pros:- Size for the money is pretty good.- Completely LED (not mixed LCD/LED like so many others in this price range)- 3 HDMIs on this price range TV is HARD to find.- Super THIN.- Base is nice, glossy, and sturdy.Cons:- Claims to be 120Hz, but acts like 60Hz - if you don't care, then purchase a slightly cheaper HDTV at 60Hz. Same quality.- Colors can be difficult to manage from one device to the next. Looks \"dim\" when it shouldn't. It's hit and miss on appropriate colors.- Remote is pretty obnoxious. Buttons are difficult to push and the \"Amazon,\" \"Netflix,\" and \"M-Go\" buttons aren't that useful since it literally takes to clicks to get to those without those buttons. ALSO, the M-Go app doesn't even work yet! \"Coming soon.\"- App selection is OK, but the user interface is SLOW and BULKY. Response time is awful. My advice? Get a Roku.- No DLNA?! Why not?! Vizio had this on all the A0 versions, but not this one? The 3d version of the A1 even has it. That was a careless decision.- 2x8w speakers on this version. A0 had 2x10w. Not a huge deal, but the older version had some better specs, but isn't available on Amazon anymore.- Takes way too long to turn on - or maybe I'm just not used to LED TVs.In the end, I would recommend you get a 60Hz with better specs elsewhere for the same cost. You won't \"see\" the 120Hz in this TV since they removed all hints of it. Perhaps Vizio was catering to people who don't like the \"Opera\" or \"PAL\" look found in smooth motion 120Hz HDTVs, but it would have been easy to make it optional for this. If you want a \"smart\" TV, get a Roku or netbox or something else with faster response time and more apps with ACTIVE developers.It's a good TV, but could have been about $50 - $100 cheaper given the fact that the TV doesn't really live up to its specifications for 120Hz.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "The unexpected five star review", "Author": "Dugong", "ReviewID": "R3CD7Z35X91528", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I don't normally give 5-star reviews because, hell's bells, there ain't nothin' perfect; so I suppose this tv probably would have got 4 stars from me yesterday morning but I'm giving it 5-stars today because I'm pretty delighted with it.The main reason I'm so happy is because last night I plugged an external HDD into it and it could read the .AVI files on it just fine ad it played back video perfectly. Tonight I'm happy because I plugged in a USB stick and the tv played back an .MP4 file perfectly. It's much more than I was expecting from this tv, to be honest. Indeed, the full user manual (which doesn't come with the tv, but has to be downloaded) explicitly says that it WON'T play DVDs or movies from a USB or HDD (not sure why, but I guess Vizio have their reasons). Anyway, I'm very pleased so far.On other matters, the tv seems to work well so far. It was very easy to set up. Connected to wireless perfectly, and fairly easily. It starts up reasonably quickly (though not as fast as I would like). I've been using the Netflix app a bit and it does fine. I bought it primarily for the 1080p / 120Hz resolution and I'm pleased with that. The sound quality is pretty good too, though I intend to hook it up to speaker system in the not too distant future so that shouldn't matter too much.All in all, I think it's a good tv, and the fact that it can read an external HDD/USB wins the 5-star rating, though if it hadn't been for that I'd have probably only given 4 stars, because I don't think it's as pretty to look at as some of the other TVs one can spend their money on.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "great TV!", "Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "R2S1CITUD4Z6OJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a 720p 60Hz Sony Bravia and this TV looks fantastic!

I went through the set-up, configured the TV to connect to my WiFi net, and Netflix and Amazon both failed saying \"Not Connected to Internet\".  I called Amazon tech support, and they finally transferred me to Vizio.  After two days, we are no closer to a fix.  All the other internet apps work fine, so it's not a connectivity issue, but Vizio told me to connect it via Ethernet cable for TWO DAYS to see if that fixes it.  I didn't buy a WiFi TV so that I could connect it to a cable!  The Vizio tech is completely unknowlegeable and is going by some cookbook troubleshooting gude.  They don't listen to reason or logic, just go through each stupid step.  They said my TV is not connecting to their \"server\", but she couldn't even tell me the domain name of the server so I could check my router log.  Anyway, still no Netflix, and I am TOTALLY UNHAPPY WITH VIZIO.  I will update this if the problem is resolved.UPDATE:  After 48 hours connected to Ethernet, the TV still won't play Netflix or Amazon.  Vizio now says the TV is broken, but since I bought it through a third party Amazon vendor that the warranty is invalid.  From bad to worse.  Now I either need to pay $50 to ship it back to the vendor and hope for a good set, or I'm stuck with a Netflix ready TV that DOES NOT CONNECT TO NETFLIX!UPDATE2:  The third party Amazon vendor has agreed to exchange the TV at no charge and pay all shipping.  I'm unsure if the problem will be fixed, but I'm happy about that part.  I will update a final time to let you know if TV #2 works as advertised.FINAL UPDATE:  Vizio Techincal support is an oxymoron.  They couldn't support anything technical if their company depended on it.  And it does.  Anyway, I returned the set and now 11 days later, they are shipping me another.  I have little faith that a new one will act any differently.  I imagine I will get a Blu-Ray player with built-in Netflix to actually use Netflix on my \"Netflix-ready\" Vizio.UPDATE AFTER SET #2:  Netflix now works thanks to the dealer that replaced the set for me.  It took 10 days, but all is well no thanks to Vizio \"tech\" support.  I did not change my rating.

Especially, for the price!You cannot find an LED full HDTV 120Mhz system for the money!  The quality is absolutely amazing.  The colors are rich. I have had this TV now for about 1 1/2 weeks and I am  thrilled. This is my first HDTV system.  I have fully checked the prices on this TV and no one has a better price for this TV but  Amazon.  If you order it from Amazon it's currently on $499 plus tax. If you are a Prime member the shipping is free.  I would advise not to buy this  TV from anyone else  who sales it for more as they are selling it over the retail price.  Amazon and Vizio direct has the best deal.  If it's on back order from Amazon its worth the wait.  I ordered mine that was initially on back order and it arrived quite quickly.  So, it's worth it.  Many other HDTVs  sale for a lot more.  LED is the best  picture currently for a full HDTV.  120 Mhz  is a fantastic refresh rate.  I would not go under 120 Mhz.  Spending a few extra $ for 120 Mhz LED or LCD system is worth it.  240Mhz is over rated.  All you need is 120 Mhz  for LED or LCD system.UPDATE:  I purchased this Vizio back in late November 2012.  I've had the HDTV now for 9 months.  Still a great TV for the price. If any downside,  it does take little while for the TV to load. (Approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute).  Overall, great picture.

We watch some stuff via an antenna but most of our viewing is in the form of streaming video. We've been using this thing for about four months. For the price I suppose it was the best option without excess wires but it's not perfect by any means. It's not uncommon for the thing to freeze up or crash. There are times when none of the buttons respond. However, I wouldn't say it's a daily problem but it's not like it has only happened 2 or 3 times either. Just be forewarned, there are still plenty of bugs in this technology.The apps end to be slow to respond and a lot less user friendly than apps on other devices I own. Netflix is decent for our needs. We're usually accessing our content via the \"Recently Watched\" section so that's not hard to navigate. Of all of the apps, it's probably the closest to functioning like the computer-based version.We occasionally use Amazon Prime streaming but you do have to pay close attention that you are choosing a movie that's included with Prime vs. something you have to pay extra for. The YouTube app is pretty awful. It doesn't access your viewing history, won't let you navigate through the individual videos in a playlist (as in I can't jump right to video 11 of 18 in a list), nor can you scroll through the videos of the channels you're subscribed too. Even the search doesn't really deliver optimal results. In my opinion, the only way to make use of YouTube on here is to create a playlist on a computer and then watch it via the TV.I do love some things about this TV though. We can plug in a flash drive and play many types of media without putting a PC and HDMI in between. (Although weirdly I have a jump drive with about 15 videos on it all in the same format, created the same way and one of them will not play on the TV.) There's an app called \"Media Center\" that will connect to the PCs on our wireless network to steam content from them. That means that any pictures, music and videos on computers can be accessed wirelessly. We used this to play a photo slideshow set to music for a birthday party.All in all, it's an ok product for the price. There's definitely a lot of room for improvement with this technology but at least we only have to deal with the power cord instead of a jumble of wires.Other info worth noting: We stream via a wi-fi connection and had to switch internet providers almost as soon as we got this TV. Our old DSL connection only delivered about 3mps (and couldn't do better because of our distance from the transformer), which was insufficient for streaming to more than one device at a time. We switched to a cable internet service, which generally gives us about 15mps, and with that we can stream videos on at least 5 devices simultaneously.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vizio 42in Smart TV", "Author": "Roo", "ReviewID": "R2F0Q4GLVVWQOC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I researched extensively and read many reviews before selecting this TV.

Hulu took 2 minutes to come up after just starting the TV. Once up it takes at least a minute before it is responsive to any buttons. Then it froze midway watching the show I selected.

This is just fine for my wife and I to watch, as we only sit a couple feet apart, at most.The sound is not bad, out of the stock speakers. It's better than the 37\" above, even though there doesn't seem to be much room in the bezel to locate speakers. I'm sure that a sound bar or home theater system would be great, but it's OK for news, TV shows, etc.I'm watching this TV in a 12' x 14' living room, corner to corner and it's adequate. I'm sure that the charts would have me with a 60\" TV, but this one is decent.At the $500 price that I got this for, I feel I got a good deal.

The Vizio logo comes up initially and then the screen goes black for 10-15 secs before starting to come back up so you don't know if it is really turning on.

I called Vizio who requested I email pictures of the problem and said they would respond within 48 hours.  Six days later they called and said they would send another TV but it would take 8 to 11 working days.  I asked if they could expedite the process since they were 4 days late in responding and Vizio said no although the gal was apologetic.

High resolution. Sleek, handsome design. Let me say upfront that I do not use this television as many would. I do not have it hooked up to a cable, nor do I use it to receive local television channels (although it does have this option as well.) I use it in three ways:1) I connect to my wireless router and use the apps (primarily Amazon of course!)2) I have this hooked up to my computer via a (very long) HDMI cable and watch streaming movies and television shows from the internet or my own collection.3) I occasionally insert a USB flash drive directly into the USB port and play movies that way.The television performs all three tasks well.First, the built in wireless receiver has worked pretty well so far with some initial buffering lags. Although I've streamed movies this way, it's not the most flawless way to watch them - for that, I recommend method 2 or 3 below.Second, I have the TV hooked up to my computer using an HDMI cable (the preferred method) which works nicely as well. In this capacity, I merely use the TV as a second monitor and play files from my computer or stream from the internet. The resolution is as good as the TV would be if it were playing movies or TV programs directly from a DVD (at least to my eye). One note if you want to do this yourself: you will need to go to your control panel and activate a second monitor and also go to your sound controls and activate the TV as primary. This is pretty easy to do - I am not really above average in technical skill.Third, I occasionally play videos directly from a USB flash drive that I insert into the USB port. When I plug a flash drive in, the TV recognizes it and asks if I would like to browse the content. I then have the option of playing a video on the drive. So far I have only tried this with .avi files but it works well. You can control the playback with the controller that comes with the television (it has pause and fast forward buttons, although the FF button does not advance the movie very quickly.)All in all this TV works wonderfully for what I bought it for. That said, the only thing that prevents me from rating 5 stars is the sound - which can be a bit tinny. The built-in speakers are certainly not ideal for quality sound but are generally good enough for the basics. At slightly higher volumes, sounds at both ranges of the spectrum cause problems. The second issue is that you must access the app store to download what should be some common apps (like the Amazon app) for the first time and occasionally I've found that this app does not always activate properly. However, once it does it works fine. The directions on how to download apps is not entirely clear. The \"app store\" application is not very clearly labeled and doesn't match how it's labeled in the directions. (It's the \"connected TV store\")Despite these issues, overall I'm very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "No web browser.", "Author": "J. F.

I let my family members set it up because I was busy, but from the looks of it they had a little trouble setting it up. I can't speak much on that. But as far as the software set-up upon turning it on, it's a tad annoying. The remote isn't very responsive, the buttons are hard to press, and trying to type the words took a lot longer than it should.Now, I have to say the reason I bought this particular TV is because it was 1080p, a Vizio, could connect to different types of web services, and had a USB port as well as a stunning display. These features were important to me because I don't have cable. I rely on Netflix, Hulu, and downloaded content from my computer to watch. I have a portable hard drive with 60 some movies and TV shows on it which I usually watch through the xbox, but plugging it right up to the TV is an amazing feature. With that being said, the TV is VERY slow in recognizing what is on the disk. Then once it loads, the print is very tiny and hard to read. And the most frustrating part is fast forwarding. There's no skip button, and the fast forward is well, slow forward. It also doesn't recognize all .avi files and claims it doesn't have the codec for it, and no apparent way to get the codec. It still appears better on this TV than the laptop, but the USB is a little pointless for me since I'll still be using it through my xbox.There are a LOT of picture settings to play with. I find that the \"game\" preset is too bright for actual gaming. The contrast is so high that all the colors blend together, so if you play call of duty, the enemy blends well with everything else. I find that the \"movie\" preset works well for most things. The internet connectivity is awesome...I never experience any lag from Netflix, but I have noticed that it doesn't stream in full 1080p, the highest it will go is 720. How do I know? Because the TV will tell you the quality of what you're watching. As far as the sound goes, it's okay but I'd still get a sound bar because it doesn't have any depth or bass.It has a very good tuner built inside, the local channels look true HD, but you'll probably need rabbit ears too. I would imagine if you're just watching cable or playing a console most of the time, this TV is awesome. But the same things I bought the TV for are a little pointless. I still love it and would recommend it.UPDATE: I've had this TV for about a year now and it has performed extremely well. The TV occasionally updates itself through the network, and I'm loving the changes. It's much more responsive than before and reads the content on my hard drive fast. Since buying it, I've gotten a PS4 and HD channels and this TV really brings out the power in both. I turned off some features like auto-brightness, true sound, etc and it doesn't use that much electricity. It's on most of the day and through regular use of lights in my apartment my electric bill stays around $30.

We find it time intensive to view the manual on line for our questions.My Husband researched TVS for a few weeks before and is was a great Christmas surprise for him!

It works all the  applications run just fine WiFi connects  quickly and DLNA is a little bit disorganize and strange (still figuring out how to work all features) but for the price i paid, I AM HIGHLY SATISFIED.

Most apps loaded on this TV are lame, Vizio needs to improve the useablility and versatility of most apps. I especially expected the Amazon app to be very versatile. We have a Roku box so we\u2019re used to using that for Amazon videos, the Amazon app on this TV just sucks compared to using the Roku. Overall set up of the TV including Wi-Fi was easy, up & running in minutes. I wish this TV had a Web-Browser but I\u2019m not really complaining, can\u2019t expect everything for the great price I got it for. I love that this TV has 3 HDMI inputs, (unusual for this price range)perfect for our use. One thing that stands out to me is the sound of the speakers. I think this TV sounds very good with just it\u2019s own speakers. Many flat-screens  I\u2019ve seen really leave a lot to be desired in the sound dept. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it ain\u2019t like home theater sound, but it is very clear sound even at higher volumes. We have a Bose wave radio and we use that in substitute of a sound bar when we watch our evening shows and movies etc\u2026 The Bose works perfect for this purpose. There are equalizer settings that you can select and customize in the menu options so you can adjust levels to your liking. The remote is easy to get use to as far as the layout, the only complaint I have about it is some of the buttons are a little too small & close together and you end up pressing a wrong one, this can especially happen if you have the lights turned down. I should say that I\u2019ve only had this TV for just over a week now so perhaps I\u2019m writing this review a little too soon but I don\u2019t really expect anything to drastically change with it in the next few weeks/months. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren\u2019t for the problems with apps and the complaint about the remote.

Yeah, that's hyperbole in it's simplest form, but I stick by it for another solitary reason... it's a stellar VALUE.

Also  under the same qualifier, I can't help but wince when I consider that my brother paid ~$1500 for a 42\" Vizio plasma just a handful of years ago... whatta long way we've come, eh?Now, if I must pick nits, the Vizio's stereo speakers are barely better than a 1970 VW Beetle's radio speaker, and the remote control is dinky, cheap plastic & non-illuminated - but who cares on either count?!?  You're not buying a 42\" display for audiophile-grade sound, and a metal, backlit wand would look ridiculous in situ, right?  Yeah, I think so, too...Anyway, hook up a good source or two (I use an Oppo BDP-103 & DirecTV HD DVR) and plug in to your two-channel or surround system and you'll be rewarded with terrific A/V entertainment.

Adams \"Phydee\"", "ReviewID": "R1E3DR19P3TQIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this for 4 months now and I am so pleased that I chose this one.I have another Vizio and my Brother has 4 Vizio's and none have had any problems.First, the price was nice for the options and the fact that it is an LED and because of the size, I was able to put it in an area that I thought I couldn't go any larger then a 39 inch.I do want to address the fact that yes, the first thing is to shut off the low lighting that the TV is set for. It's too bad people have returned this TV because they didn't realize it arrives set for the bedroom atmosphere and that is too bad.  I'm more surprise that Vizio actually has this turned on when new and not set at the normal setting. So, the picture didn't look too good.  Once this is off, it's now a WOW effect.I think the colors are vibrant and you can do all kinds of adjustments that are your preference.I wanted this TV for the formal living room where I just want to relax and watch some television.  I am not into all the Netflix and the other things that it can do...just wanted a nice size television with a great picture.  I have a large Sony all set for another room where the movies and Netflix is used...but I must say, I believe this one has a better picture...not by much as the Sony cost me 3 times the price of this one and also has a nice picture.When I lost my entire home in a fire, I never bought another Bose system for any televisions...just not a priority and I can honestly say, I haven't missed it.  I like the speakers on this television, sounds ok to me and they are on the front and not the side...which can make a difference. I'm in my 50's now, guess the surround system really isn't missed now. I have it on a nice television table with underneath drawers but it would be great even to hang on the wall...the size is just perfect being the LED.  I never would have had a 42 inch TV in this area...like I said, was originally looking at no larger then a 39.  It does take about 20 seconds to come on as it downloads data, but that doesn't bother me at all  Believe me, I fill that 20 seconds with something else to do.I would recommend this TV to anyone and when you deal with Amazon, if there is a problem, they stand behind the product should there be something wrong with it or comes damaged.  The box did have a small dent in it, had that kind of panic for a moment hoping the screen and everything was ok, but it was pretty well packed inside.For this kind of money, you get a very nice TV without having to spend another few hundred dollars.  My other Vizio I have had for 5 years now, picture is great, colors...perfect and have never had a problem with it.  Funny, how now we have Televisions in a number of rooms...not the 50's and 60's anymore...if you get it...enjoy it. Oh, before I forget, it seems when looking at TV's, the LCD TV's are not putting much into extra's...think they just want to go all LED now..you may already know that.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tv!", "Author": "Kristine Ott", "ReviewID": "R2T0PXGCS05ZQB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall a great tv, super happy I purchased it!

The sound quality seems OK to me, although I'm not exactly an audiophile. I'm very happy with this TV, however I didn't give it 5 stars because:To connect to our home network I needed the WIFI MAC address. I was able to find it eventually, but it was way harder than it should have been. The MAC address should be provided to you, you shouldn't have to search for it. It's not on a sticker on the back where the serial # and model # are. It's nowhere in the manual. The manual just refers you to a website. The website never heard of a MAC address. It's buried in a help menu you'll come across when you're exploring the settings. I did a google search of \"how to find the MAC address of a Vizio TV\", and found a YouTube video explaining how to get to it.Anything connecting to the internet will require typing e-mail addresses, user names, and passwords, movie and TV show titles etc. There's a lot of typing involved and the remote doesn't have any keyboard or mouse. There's 4 directional tab buttons and an OK button. This setup works, but I thought I left this sort of thing, tabbing around, behind like 30 years ago. I hate the feeling that any second now every smart TV will start to come with a remote that has a qwerty keyboard available, real or touchscreen. Maybe it will be possible to upgrade this model to a new aftermarket remote, but then I'll have to buy that as an additional cost...To be fair most other TVs don't have a better way of typing inputs from users yet either.This TV has the best picture quality out there in this price range, period.My biggest frustration isn't really with this specific TV at all, it's with all the smart TVs I looked at - the remote is not as smart as the TV.

I did some reading and it seems to be an issue that happens once in awhile with the app. You just have to do some factory resetting and everything is working fine again.

Pieri", "ReviewID": "R2GM04DECBW5XF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I first got this TV the picture was bad. I then adusted all to what I like and now the picture is awesome. The colors, the clarity is very crisp. I sit about 8 feet from the screen and it look amazing. I have a Samsung and a LG and I put this one pretty close in picture quality to both of them. I am partial to samsung but being a senior I need to save money where I can. This TV cost about $150.00 less than the samsung and the picture quality is pretty close. The sound is good. I had a cabinet for the TV but it was not wide enough so I put an extended shelf on it and put the TV on it. With it that way the speakers sound goes down so the shelf block the sound. I then cut the shelf so the TV fit on the center and I cut the corners off and then the sound was good. I would say that most LCD TV's are this way. I had the same problem with the samsung and LG. I did the same and made a shelf with the ends cut off. The remote is kind of flimsy but it works okay. The apps are good. I have Amazon prime so I can get videos free and it works good.Pros: Picture quality, Thin edgeCons: remote, speaker placement(kind of hard to go anywhere else)1 other problem is that there is about a 30 sec delay after you turn on the TV and my satelite before you get a picture. On my Samsug and LG it is instant. Being IT Pro this kind of scares me.I did get a 4 year Warranty with Square trade because I hears that with Vizio TV's that after 1 year they say they are unfixable if you have a panel problem.Update 1/1/14 This TV is so so. The delay between changing channels is awful. I have a LG and there is no delay on this tv you can go out of the room and come back in and it still has not change channels. When you turn it on there is at least a 30-45 sec wait for the picture to come on. I am sorry I did not buy a better brand. I have Comcast now and I still have this problem. It drives me crazy. Even to make matters worst is that sometimes it does change channels fast but I don't know why the difference. I am tempted to junk this TV but I have a four year warranty and so I will keep it. It would be nice if Visio would fix this problem. I have also had problem with the smart tv part of this. It constantly will not let me into Amazon. I have Amazon prime and I cannot watch it on this TV and that is one of the reason I got this. For people who think they should spend money for a smart Tv be smart and buy a aux box that you can used on different TV's and save yourself a lot of money. I have apps on this TV and on my LG and I use them maybe 1% of the time compare to watching TV. I have a WD media device that I used at my Second place and I am sorry I did not get another one here.

For some reason, my gut was telling me not to get the Vizio and to stick with the Samsung, but the Vizio was purchased nonetheless.When attempting to watch Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime content, the entire set would lock-up.  Sometimes, it would begin responding again after a few minutes.  Other times, it would never come back and the system could only be recovered by pulling the power cable.  Factory resets of both the firmware and the \"dock\" software did not change this behavior.It appears there are other firmware-related issues with this Vizio series and while the specs on paper seem great, it simply did not work out that way for us.Amazon is always great about returns and agreed to return the TV.  Purchasing a TV on Amazon though, is something that compelled me to write this review.  I strongly encourage every customer who reads this, to reconsider purchasing a TV from Amazon or online in general.  While their customer service has been great about returns, the entire burden of the return process is on the customer.  UPS and Amazon do not communicate, so it took multiple phone calls and failed UPS visits for both companies to get on the same page about the Call Tag from UPS.  Amazon will not refund the money until they either have the TV in their possession or after we pushed a bit, they agreed they could issue the refund once they saw it had reached a service center.  That is going to take another 24-48 hours for their systems to update.So what was supposed to be a purchase that brought a new TV into the house for use by Tuesday, has turned into 4 days of phone calls, re-packing a TV, and up to two weeks for a refund (unless we call in again and 'push' to have them issue a refund sooner).You're better walking in to your local big-box store so you can test the TV, check all the features you want, and then return the TV and get a new one the same day, should there be issues.  We love our Amazon Prime account and for small items, this is great.  It's so easy to click and add it to your cart, but it's definitely not the same convenience level if something goes wrong.

The picture quality is awesome and the sound is good.  The bass is a little low but no tinny sound.

The set up is much more complicated than necessary, I will get back with more after investigating more of the functions that are available on this unit. First buy the qwert remote, not included in box, wait to set up till it is delivered by Amazon.The continuation: The picture color is really only acceptable with VIVID, all other modes are basically washed out! The built in apps,are for the most part, trash. The free ones are worth that, the you pay for, are not as wide as should be in content, or number. But how many movie/TV channels does one need? The main objection to use most of them is the selection is only available on a side bar of 3 rows of 5 or 6, this relates to a 1\" sq. pic to read the title, and see the cover photo, or select to go full screen and then fight your way back with more clicking on the tiny remote to your next guess. Having to use 2 remotes to control cable and TV or extras is a pain. This is a WIFI TV with Access to the internet, but only through the apps that it has, and not capable of being changed except to remove them. To use the SKYPE, it will run you about $150, only the Vizio camera will work, and it is trash compared to Logitech low end units.NOW HOW TO FIX!! Hook your laptop to it, and it becomes a nice monitor, web surf able, and a TV with your old cable or Sat, box. A roku box and you have the better and more than you received in the nice Big Box, marked SMART! Conclusion: For the price it is the bottom end, the unit follows that value.

This TV weighed in at about 25 lbs and was a BREEZE to but up.It says 120Hz, but I think its really 60 - once you get above 60, the picture seems too perfect to me, and the whole thing looks fake, so I like the picture.The Apps - they work, well, and that makes my wife and kid happy watching Tinkerbell and Fresh Beat Band while mom gets ready in the morning.Setup Time - 10 minutes tops, with apps - maybe 20 - and it took me another 10 this morning when the netflix app updated itselfAll in all my first impression is remarkably positive.

I've bought several Vizio's over the years and recommended it to many, the biggest factor for all those purchases was 120hz. When Vizio listed that spec in the past, we all knew what it meant, it meant the option to enable and disable the \"soap opera\" effect. I've only bought 120hz and up TV's in the past few years, so I am accustomed to having the feature on as it dramatically reduces motion blur and adds a nice effect. So when Vizio listed the spec here, I would not think I needed to investigate further to discover that they have changed their definition of what it means. The spec has a universal implication as I said, we all know what it means and what it's supposed to do, but in this case, what does Vizio mean by that spec if it doesn't have smooth motion?Can I connect a computer to the TV and select 120hz as the refresh rate? NODoes this TV process the frames and double them artificially to reduce motion blur? NO (thus the blurriness)So what does Vizio mean by listing the spec \"120hz?\"I spoke to William at Vizio's online chat and this was his explanation:\"It's performing like a 60hz TV because of the input source.  The TV's processing 60hz twice.  It really needs the smooth motion algorithm to stitch those frames together.\"So, if it needs smooth motion to make it perform like 120hz, and it doesn't have this, HOW CAN YOU LIST IT IN THE SPECS?!  Also, I tested all input sources and the blurriness was still very much present.This is a 60hz TV which they are passing off as 120hz to all those gullible enough to purchase it and I know why they did it. Many people turn the effect off on their TV's, when you check sites for recommended calibrations for TV's, most recommend turning the feature off, so Vizio probably thought they could save a few bucks by leaving the feature out on the 47\" and below, but then, why list it in the specs?This apparent malicious intent to mislead is why Vizio won't see another cent of my money. I've bought 4 vizio tv's over the years and recommended it to friends who bought another 10, 1 of who ordered the E420i-A1 which I set up for him last night only to discover the blurring mentioned earlier. I stupidly had ordered the 47\" to replace my Vizio M3D420SR who's HDMI PORTS have all died (which renders the TV useless since Vizio has no motherboards to fix the issue and have no idea if they will ever get them back in stock). I'm actively trying to cancel the 47\" though it already shipped.

If there are actually 5 or more that are black, please contact us at 877-878-4946 or by chat at [...]Thank you, and have a great day!", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "The stand is junk.", "Author": "Michael S Stuart", "ReviewID": "R2B6H4MCR8ZTLI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The stand broke as soon as I sat it down.

It was priced like the competitor tv's but I had heard good things about Vizio so we got it. I will never buy another Vizio product and here is why.The sound does not regulate no matter the settings. I have to change the audio settings to change between inputs for Blue ray, x box, DVD, cable, etc. to get the volume to be in a normal range and each channel has a different base volume to be able to hear.Picture quality is ok but the 1080 is not even a big deal below 42\".The customer service for Vizio when contacted about the problems is marginal at best and even when you do call during normal business hours many times you will just be disconnected before speaking with a representative.The TV also shuts off after so long but you never know when. The only good indicator is when the volume starts to go \"funny\" because I have had the volume go way up or off before this happens.Overall this poorly made tv is also not the most eye appealing. The Vizio that lights up draws attention away from the screen and the response time is rather slow. I would suggest nearly any other brand for a purchase.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible!", "Author": "Lex", "ReviewID": "R1AQKSE1E9VQKN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "VIZIO E420i-A1 42-inch 1080p 120Hz LED Smart HDTV.  I brought one here on Amazon, after reading the reviews and after reviewing a store model at a local Walmart--the local model was not the best TV in the store, but it was watchable and if this one I bought was close to it in performance, then I wouldnt be so upset. For those who rate this as a 5 star purchase, great for you for getting a good TV.  As for me, I got one that is terrible, and it is very painful to watch anything on.  I rated this as a 2 star because setting up was easy--it took less than five minutes from opening the box, to setup internet, cable, and to began watching a program; however, I spent 3 hours trying to calibrate to no avail, I even went on line to see if someone posted suggestion and I did not find any recommendation.  The picture quality, pixel definition, and performance is one of the worst that I have ever seen.  In my home, I have two smaller Vizio internet TVs and the quality of those two is 100 times better.  I hope Vizio realized that the primary purpose of buying TVs is to be able to watch a program in clarity, having internet and other goodies are secondary and are meaningless if the primary purpose is not met.What ticks me off more about this is that I have a 20 year old 60 inch (CRT)Sony TV that show clearer picture that this.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV OK, Delivery Rotten", "Author": "Proudmale \"Proudmale\"", "ReviewID": "R2V26KD7CK1PFV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My siblings and I ordered this TV almost three weeks in advance of our parents 60th anniversary.  Big event for two of the greatest people ever.  Shipping was delayed and delayed until finally about 2:30 in the morning on Friday it was delivered to UPS shipping center in Phoenix AZ.  We figured it was still okay as they only had to travel 730 miles to Salt Lake City over Friday, Saturday, and Sunday -- not to big of a stretch for a shipping giant.  So we left Denver and went to Salt Lake to get ready for the big party.Checked delivery status around noon on Monday, and was promised delivery by 5:00 PM still in time for that evenings party.  When package had not arrived called around 6:00 PM to find out what happened.  UPS told me they did not even get the package until around 5:34 PM and would delivery it the next day.  The supervisor I spoke to told me that the Friday delivery I had seen was for when the shipping label was created and given to UPS, not the delivery of the product.  (Hmm, wonder why the label was sent to Phoenix when the product arrived at the UPS warehouse in Salt Lake -- slow way to deliver a piece of paper??)If you have any kind of a deadline in mind, DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT, rely on Amazon to meet your needs or their published shipping times.  I wish I had spend $20 more and picked it up locally in Salt Lake.  That way two of the finest people it has ever been my pleasure to know would have got their TV at the party instead of a web page print out.Shame on you Amazon -- while I am admittedly not your biggest customer, I have ordered several big ticket items off of you.  Key word was ordered as in will never order in the future.Worse on you UPS --  I will never use you again for any package delivery, nor will I ask for you on any packages I order.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV", "Author": "ACE", "ReviewID": "R1WNWP69CWWVKK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I recieved this TV I could tell the box had been opened, the remote was missing and the screen had been broken.
