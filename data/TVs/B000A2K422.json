I typically watch the HDTV in the living room, then go to my bedroom to watch this TV, and I think this picture still looks really good. The size and weight are ... formidable, so be ready to work hard to get it where you want it, and do get a heavy duty stand, because it weighs over 200 lbs, and if you try to swap out a 32 incher for this you may find your stand flattened like a roadside squirrel. The only complaint I have with this TV is that it occasionally emits a high-pitched buzz for 30 seconds or so, and then goes back to quiet. Until flat-panel TV's get much, much cheaper, this TV is an excellent alternative for decent screen size and sub-1000 dollar price.", "Date": "December 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very good TV", "Author": "Melissa DeLong \"Missy\"", "ReviewID": "R2W946UZBU03JO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my Trinitron for about 10 years now. It is still a great tv. At the time we didn't like the rectangular screens. We wanted a regular square screen that was good quality and we found it with this tv. It has never given us any problems. The only draw back is the weight. We moved into our current house 8 years ago. We placed the tv where we thought best and it hasn't moved since. I recommend this tv.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Greatest $700 Spent.", "Author": "Oscar Burgos Jr. \"BoogieNYC\"", "ReviewID": "RO7MWWNC5IYAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looking for a great quality picture tv but don't have the money or desire for a plasma or LCD? This is the way to go. I have had this tv for abut a year and have not had a single problem with it. I totally recommend it. The ONLY negative thing about this is the weight. It's about 200+ pounds so better get some friends together to lift this bad boy.", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Big lug of a TV, but awesome picture.", "Author": "Darik D.
