The picture clarity is awesome, the unit is light, so hanging it on the side of a cabinet was accomplished without the need for extra reinforcement.  We bought the VideoSecu ML10B mount (it weighs more than the TV)that was recommended and it is great. We fold the TV flat against the end of a cabinet when not in use and the articulating arm lets it swing out and around the end of the cabinet when we want to watch.  You don't have to be staring straight at the screen for a good picture. The DVD player works well. My Techie son-in-law looked at it and said \"wow! this thing has ports all over it\". (We'll never use them all.)  The sound is OK even over the noise of the roof air. (it would be nice if it had better speakers, but it gets the job done) We thought about the 19\" model, but space is a premium and this little set and its great picture gets it done in a BIG way, no regrets on this choice.We are using and old standard RV anntenna from the 80's with a built in signal amplifier and we get better reception than in our house.

The Axess remote cannot be integrated with a learning remote so you will have to switch back and forth between the remote provided and the one from the cable company. Also, while on the remote subject the Axess unit control buttons seem to be made for left handed people with its  power and volume buttons situated to the left side.  Most importantly is the sound which is harsh, making one's ear drums pucker.  I found that placing a towel around the bottom of the integrated speakers helps reduce this unpleasantess.  Axess provides a number of software sound options, such as movie, standard, user etc.,along with base and treble controls, but the sound improves only minimaly when used.  By the way I have notice that sound quality is a major complaint for most small flat screen TVs.  Last the Axess TVD 1901-15 15.6 takes about 30 seconds or sligtly more to come to life.

It is not a cheap unit with respect to quality. The price is nice, however, and the unit is very light-weight. The ports (plug-ins) were well planned, and include all you'll likely need. Plugs directly into (newer) car decks with auxiliary mini-jack, for excellent stereo sound. The screen view is good. There are optional picture settings and a user setting too- resolving most bright-light and low-light issues. Note that picture loses contrast, etc. when viewing at angle, from center. Screen is tilt-adjustable. There is a pause function, but no slow-motion. In a large RV, the screen is a bit small. In a car, it's pretty big. I have not used the TV function.

I went with the 15.4 inch model instead of the 13 inch because of a nicer screen size, not too big same size as seats, gets alot of looks from others seeing two of them glowing from the back seats. The speakers put out a decent loud sound level and is not distorted but treble, Has Earphone and PC Input jacks. The picture is HD and the picture is nice and sharp, not fuzzy or cheap looking and comes with a nice full sized remote control.
