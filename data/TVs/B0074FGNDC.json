{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Value, Has Quirks Like Nearly All Current TV's", "Author": "Gabriel N. Getchell \"gfunk\"", "ReviewID": "R211CQ7X5TCQGM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV is simply a very good, simple TV. As stated by many others, this TV does not have the sort of Internet Connected bells and whistles you find on more expensive sets. This doesn't bother me - I have 3 devices hooked up to this TV that are already able to do Netflix, Hulu, etc... and far better than I've seen built into a TV. I recently purchased the 50\" model and have enjoyed it thoroughly (and I'm very, very particular about image quality).The TV is a bit thick compared to many other LED lit LCDs - not an issue for me since it will not be wall mounted. The thickness is the result of LED rear-lighting versus LED edge-lighting. While the latter allows thinner panels, the technology inherently lowers the image quality. More expensive sets overcome this issue and provide great pictures, but at the lower-end of the price spectrum, image quality is may be better served by rear-lighting. The set also has none of the \"flashlight\" effect (bright spots along the screen borders) that is common in even high-end edge-lit sets.IMHO the black levels produced by a TV are the single most important aspect of overall image quality. This TV does a pretty-darn-good job, but don't expect it to be nearly as good as a decent plasma television. If you keep a few small lights on in the room while you watch a movie the blacks will appear quite nice and dark. In a pitch-black room however, you'll be looking at dark gray instead. The trade off is this TV gets brighter than most plasmas on the market, making it's picture clearer in a brightly lit room. Some edge-lit sets can dim portions of the screen to improve the black level, but this also comes with image trade-offs such as \"blooming\" (seeing the edge of the brightly lit portion of the screen spilling into the dark areas). Unlike some very high end sets with \"full-array\" rear-lighting, this set cannot turn off individual LEDs to dim portions of the screen.This is all really just a long-winded way to say that this TV seems like a good deal, and seems to have image quality that is comparable in several ways to more expensive sets. After weighing the trade-offs of many (MANY) TVs, this seems to have been the right choice for me. It would have gotten 5 stars, but Samsung has decided to put only 2 HDMI inputs on this set (1-2 less than others at the price point). Its a mild annoyance having to use an HDMI switch for several of my components, but far from a deal-breaker and possibly not an issue for the majority of people.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV Value", "Author": "adamjive", "ReviewID": "R359F65Z8OD5E2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is a great value in the Samsung line.  At the time I purchased this, it was $1000(!) cheaper than the step up model with 3D and smart TV (I have the 65\").  3D isn't important to me at all, and I have an Xbox so all of the streaming and stuff wasn't important either.  Forget what Cnet says about this TV, I find the picture to be solid and the black levels to be completely acceptable for an LED.I'll get the CONS out of the way first...It's a little thicker since it is a full array LED, but that's ok in my set up and I prefer the full array as it tends to give more consistent lighting than edge lit.The biggest knock is the lack of input/output options.  I am trying to simplify, so it's not insurmountable in my case, but if this will be the center piece of a complex set up you'll probably need a receiver to get all of the processing you will want.  One note, the optical out down converts to stereo from 5.1/ 7.1 etc. so you'll want to consider that.That's it on the CONS.  The picture is great, the processing of signals seems to be solid, and there are no artifacts when watching fast moving action.One major thing I did find with the picture, however, is the \"Auto Motion Plus\" setting.  This makes high def movies look terrible for some reason.  Like it was shot with a handheld camera.  I have found no benefit for this  setting and suggest turning it off immediately!I tweaked settings for a few days and feel like I have honed it in:1.

Lyons", "ReviewID": "R4SM9AZVASMLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want a smart TV or a 3D TV, this is not one. That being said, I wanted a TV not another computer-like device, and this fits the bill perfectly. My Bluray player has Wifi and all that jazz if the mood ever strikes me, so why pay hundreds (literally) so my TV can have it. I don't think I'd ever use it, I have a laptop and a smartphone for those types of things. I think there are lots of us with that viewpoint about a TV.If you want a brilliant HD picture, a nice big-but-not-crazy-huge 50\" screen, then this TV is perfect. The thin bezel (frame) makes it look like it's all screen while you're watching it, it's nice! The sound, while some people say it's awful, is actually quite nice considering NO thin LED TVs have booming sound. Compared to TVs of yesteryear this TVs sound is actually nice & crisp with a little bass (not much) and fairly spacious. I find it VERY adequate for day to day watching. i also have the Vizio VHT215 soundbar for when I want to crank it during a movie. But if you've never been a theater sound person then don't believe people who say this TVs sound royally sucks, it doesn't. It's fine, maybe a notch above similar thin TVs on the market.It has 2 HDMI ports so you can hook up your satellite or cable box, and your Bluray. If this angers you because you also have a Wii or an Xbox, then you'll have to make the sacrifice of either a) a switch, or b) moving a cable, which takes all of 5 seconds. Or if you have a soundbar that has HDMI inputs (like the Vizio VHT215) you can pipe your devices into it (as a switch) and then feed the signal(s) to your TV that way.If this TV had everything under the sun it wouldn't cost only $1100 and be on sale often for around $800-900. It would cost $2400....which is what some upper-end Samsungs do cost. So therefore, don't believe the criticism that this TV is \"mediocre\" based on the fact that it lacks things that make it pricier. It is 120Hz (midrange to good); 1080p (as good any other); 20watt sound (good, on par with competitors); 50\" (well, it's big but not huge- plenty for sitting 10-15' away); Nice looking (as most black TVs are); Matte screen (keeps extra reflections to a minimum); has a backlit remote control [the buttons light up] (a touch that most competitor don't offer- nice for night time viewing); has zillions of color, brightness, LED level, smooth motion, movie, dynamic, blah blah blah adjustments (if you're a tweaker you can tweak to your heart's content); it has a joystick-style control on the bottom right-of-center edge instead of buttons (for power on/off, settings, menu, etc- unique to most TVs).Anyway, you get the idea. It has all those things new TVs have, plus Samsung's reputable picture quality. Oh, and it states it costs an average of $11 to run. For a year. Wow. I think my old Sony boob tube cost that a month! And I'll brag a little, this TV only cost me $447. Haha, I scored four $100 gift cards to Best Buy from work and it was on sale for $799. Cha ching for me.Uber-happy with this TV because I knew what I was buying before I bought it, and it has what I want and not extra bloatware I don't need. well worth the $800 sale price, and I honestly think it's worth the $1100 retail tag.Cheers!", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "I HATED THIS TV!

Lee", "ReviewID": "R2FT1POYOYEG32", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have the 240hz version of the TV.  The picture is great but Samsung's engineers and their customer support are idiots.  First of all, the picture is great but here are the caveats:1. The media play feature is nice. It let's you hook up a hard drive via USB to watch files.  The problem is that if you are using the feature, you can't adjust the picture with the remote.  As soon as you try the playback stops.  The problem is that when you play files from the HD the picture is very dark and there is no way to adjust.2. LED Automotion is 'ON' as default.  This will make the picture look like it's in 3D.  I hate it. Turned it off after wondering why all the images looked like I was watching a soap opera.3. For audio out, there are only two options: headphone jack and a optical audio out. The problem is when you hook up speakers to it, you CAN'T adjust the volume with the remote control!  You can adjust the internal TV speakers, but if your sound bar or speakers do not have a remote for volume, you are screwed.  I emailed Samsung Customer support and their canned answers are a joke.  They can't even discern what is the problem.  Therefore, for sound, you really need to hook up a receiver to the TV or make sure that your speakers have a remote included.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Top 3 in this price range compared. Samsung wins.", "Author": "Chad D. Hummel", "ReviewID": "R1NKREWROGOLQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best review in my opinion is a comparison to other products. Those are most helpful to me.  I'll compare the Vizio 65\u201dE  the Sharp Aquos 60\u201d 755u and the Samsung UN65EH6000.  I had narrowed it down to these 3 tv's based on price (all $1300 at time of purchase) and excellent reviews(over 4.5 star).Remote:  The Samsung and Sharp remote are quite nice. The sharp for some reason has their sensor dead center on the TV to where I would have to hold the remote way up high so the center speaker didnt interfere/block the the signal. Solution would have been to raise the tv up with a piece of wood or something or reposition the center speaker out of center. Wall mounting isnt an option since in my home there is no option except for in front of a window.  The Samsung remote is great,the tv's IR sensor is on the side like most tv's Its almost the same remote as the 2007 tv.  Both remotes are very good. Vizio on the other hand provided about the cheapest remote I could imagine. It has to be pointed in the exact right spot to work. Even with brand new batteries. I've seen many reviews stating the same thing. They have to know with a bigger tv, maybe individuals arent sitting as close to the tv set so a stronger IR signal is needed.  I don't recall ever having an issue like this with something brand new.  It just felt cheap and like it could easily break.Base/Stand:  All 3 are about the same. The Sharp maybe a little better probably because it was supporting a 60\u201d instead of a 65\u201d. The Sharp did seem to have a little bit of a lean to it, like it wasnt balanced. Like one side of the tv was heavier than the other. But nothing major. There were complaints on reviews for both the Samsung and Vizio base. Both have a little wobble to them,but  both would need quite a jar to knock them over.Picture Quality: Obviously each have their own opinion but  I'd rank Samsung #1 Sharp a close #2 and Vizio a distant 3rd.  Cnet reviews do not match my personal experience. I tried many posted user settings and my own calibrations using the Disney WOW disk and trial and error.  The vizio at times would look ok but always seemed like all scenes took place in a light fog in the middle of the screen. Some setting changes helped but never completely went away.  Its a thicker tv so I assumed its backlit and not edge lit like the Sharp.  Still scenes looked wonderful but motion did not. There was a lot of graininess in the background most of the time.  We returned this tv to amazon for those reason  along with the awful remote, terrible glare issues on the screen, and some glare issues of the bezel.  The bezel is  a shiny black plastic that reflects light like you wouldnt believe, its also wavy like its  warped so the light reflections off this bezel are extremely annoying. I'll be honest I'm surprised to see no mention of this on the Amazon reviews. That being said, If this was my first flat screen tv I wouldn't  realize the PQ is slightly sub par.  The Sharp was very nice. Excellent looking quality on everything about it including PQ. It was a little too sharp looking sometimes , even with sharpness turned down. It created artifacts in the image. Really not bad though and better than the opposite affect . Color was best out of the 3. The smart part of this TV was so far ahead of the Vizio in layout and speed. This tv also has 3D  which I wasnt interested in nor the smartTV. I have my own devices that do what the SmartTv does. Roku and a bluray player perform those functions faster and better.  I seen an HD roku at walmart for $28 far cheaper than increased price to incorporate it in a tv. First 3d experience with the Sharp. Was surprised at its quality compared to movie theater 3-D. Still not that interesting to me and I dont like wearing glasses to watch TV. The piece between your eyes is annoying everything is a tad darker and lacks focus. I didnt buy it for the 3-d.  There was more of a glare issue with this tv and we also felt cheated in that we had to downgrade in size. The 70\u201d was out of price range. After  watching a 65\u201d for a week a 60\u201d seemed so small and that we werent getting what we wanted and what we spent our hard earned money for. . If the Vizio would have worked out we wouldnt even have tried this TV.  So we bit the bullet and got the Samsung which I should have done in the first place. It was more only because we bought it at best buy and had shipping and state sales tax. It doesn't have the smarttv feature or 3-d . It only has the best picture quality of the three. For us it came down to that.  The out of box settings werent as good as on the Sharp.  There were many setting posted for this tv in reviews I tried them all but all resulted  in a worse picture for me. Even the WOW disk resulted in a worse picture. It took tweaking with my own eyes to get the picture to  look amazing. . I actually wish there were less picture settings, no reason for that much change if its properly calibrated at the factory.  The Samsung by far has the least glare problem. Watching a football game now looks like  your watching it through a glass window. Like my old Samsung. The Sharp looked like you were watching a cartoon or video game of a football game, thats exaggerated to make the point. I won't post my setting unless asked because as I said it appears that each set requires different setting or its user opinion.Side notes:  Amazon was great on the return of the Vizio. Full refund although the tv is still sitting in my living room, its been over a month. The shipping companies are busy during the holiday season. No fault of Amazon.Also I feel I have to mention this. I am disappointed with Vizio support. A phone call and an email got me about 10 emails replys from them. Each stating they can't help me. It would be best over the phone. One stating they could not provide any assistance with the remote since its made by a 3rd party. What??That being said I did not get a reply from Sharp support, even though I was told I would within 4 days.  I have never had to call Samsung support as Ive never had an issue.Out of the box the Samsung needed the backlight and brightness turned down that was 99% of it right there.  Some motion scenes did look odd. I tweaked the blur (5) and judder (10) settings and its much improved.

Mine had the YH02 specifically.At face value this looks bad - you are getting a Samsung TV from the 3rd worse panel manufacturer that Samsung uses. In practice, all 65\" Samsung panels are all either made by AU Optronics or Samsung themselves (and only then in the 65F8000 range at three times the cost of this set. UPDATE (1/30/14): Since writing this review the 65\" Samsung panel has also been seen in the UN65F7000 range). So perhaps a better perspective is that this is the second best 65\" TV you can buy from Samsung.What does this mean in real life?The AU Optronics panel has inferior contrast to the native Samsung panels, in particular the blacks turn into blues when you view from a sharp angle. Off-axis viewing is still better than many edge-lit TVs (I'm looking at you Sharp and Vizio) largely due to the fact that this TV is direct-lit (this is not a \"sexy\" TV by any means). Sat in-front of the set, blacks look superb, and watching typical television from an angle you probably won't even notice the blueish blacks, but if you are planning on buying this set to watch movies from a sharp angle (why would you do this?) then I'd have to recommend looking elsewhere - either a plasma or perhaps a direct-lit IPS based LG (for example the 60LN5600), of course these displays have their own problems.On that note - this TV is glossy. Glossy enough that I can clearly make out my individual lights if I happen to be sat at an angle where they are reflected. If you have something like a bright window that you could see if you placed a mirror where this will go then trust me - you really do not want this TV.  That being said, this TV is capable of getting extremely bright (I personally have the backlight set to 12/20 and many people set it lower) without obliterating black levels so it will do just great in a bright environment, just make sure nothing will be directly reflected from where you are sat.A major issue with this panel is something called \"quantization error\". The hardware on the TV has to translate the digital color information into a real physical color by determining which \"sub-pixels\" are turned on or off (each color (r,g,b) for each pixel is controlled by a number of sub-pixels which are turned on or off to vary the intensity of that particular color). Color \"quantization error\" is loosely analogous to aliasing if you are familiar with that problem. With this particular panel either a bad algorithm or a hardware limitation results in defined bands when attempting to render a smooth color gradient. Many LCD displays suffer from this problem but it is particularly evident in this case. Upon discovery of this problem my gut instinct was to return the TV immediately, but in practice the problem rarely manifests itself when watching TV/Blurays or playing games. I do see it from time to time (sunsets are affected) and some people can't accept it, but for me the beautiful picture makes up for the odd artifact.There are some great advantages to this panel. There is no evidence of motion blurring and latency is very low (I've seen 39ms reported) - this is a great TV to game on. I was blown away by how good blurays looked on this set and Wall-e, which I thought would severely be effected by quantization artifacts, looked incredibly good. A nice bonus of having a direct-lit TV is that you shouldn't suffer from uneven backlighting which is often seen using edge-lit displays and my particular TV had no clouding.Settings:I am an HTPC user and have not used the built in tuner.First you must re-label the HDMI input as PC or PC DVI - this changes the underlying behaviour of the panel.

For less than a grand, a 65\" LED, that too back lit and not edge lit. can be considered a good deal in my eyes. To give you a little background, I am a picky person when it comes to my audio and video. My existing setup had a Panasonic plasma, albeit a few years old, Energy take classic speakers, Denon receiver, and Monoprice cables. I like quality products, but at a reasonable price. You can sure buy Bang and Olufsen speakers, Macintosh labs receivers, Panasonic Kuro or ZT60 TV and other high end equipment for better quality and pay significantly higher price for the same but that's just not me. I had been researching the available 60\"-65\" TVs for quite a few weeks and read through detailed AVSForums, CNET and HDTVGuru reviews and many other forums to get an idea on what's out there that would appeal to a more value conscious buyer who does not want to sacrifice on the picture quality. I was initially very skeptical because CNET rated this TV pretty low due to subpar black levels but when i compared this one to other comparable TV sets in this size range, the difference was minimal.I zeroed down to this TV, Sharp 60LE650, and Samsung 6400 series. I decided not to consider Samsung 6300/6350 as the picture quality on that set is, at best, as good as 6000 series. The thin factor did not matter much to me and frankly backlit TVs are supposed to be a bit thicker vs edge lit. I did not care for \"Smart\" as in my humble opinion, even the smartest of the available TVs cannot keep up with the Rokus and Apple TVs of the world. I know for a fact that TV manufacturers, as a habit, do not think about providing backward compatible upgrades that will work for TVs that are more than a year old. So I was not willing to pay $300 $-400 premium for smart TVs when just using an Apple TV or a Roku can provide me with all desired content and then some more. I also did not care about number of HDMI connections as I already have a receiver with 5 Inputs. And frankly, even if you do not have a receiver, you can always add an HDMI switch for less than $20 and you will be all set. And then again for sound, you can buy a sound bar or setup a home theatre if you have a receiver. Make sure you buy the model ending in 6000 if you plan to add a sound bar directly to the TV. The models ending in 6001 and 6003 do not have an Audio out so your only option would be to add sound bar to your cable box or other device which limits the options.Back to the TV review, as I played with the settings, out of the box settings looked ugly. But just a little playing with the settings to adjust contrast, turn off Auto motion plus, Set Mode as Movie, and other adjustments to my taste and picture looks good, reasonably good. Again, I had seen the best of the TVs in the stores including Panasonic ST60, VT60, ZT60 and  Samsung 8000 series and while the blacks on those TVs are better, I could not justify spending over 2K on them. The picture quality difference wasn't that dramatic. The sound on the TV sucks but then you can add a soundbar for just about $100. I did not face any issues, so far, with any light bleeding, banding, or other image issues, reported by other reviewers. I did a pixel test on YouTube to check any dead pixels and there were none.  Colors were sharp, looked realistic with some playing around, and picture was bright enough even while trying to get better blacks on the TV. There are multiple forums where you can find all sorts of settings for tweaking the picture quality. I would advise trying some of them and see what you like. For those who care, my panel was YH02, supposedly manufactured by AU Optronics but I won't sweat it. I bought an extended three year warranty so I think I will be covered.I seriously think CNET needs to review this set again as they reviewed this set in 2012. I did read in the forums that initial set of UN65EH6000 TVs in 2012 has panel problems which may have swayed CNET's results but more recent panels and updates seem to make this model a good buy. So if you are one of those who want a BIG TV, without the BIG price, and are prepared to use different components for smart content, this one is a keeper. If money is not a question, go ahead and buy a ZT60 if it is still available. I will update the review as Time passes and I have had a chance to look at this TV side by side vs my 50\" Panasonic plasma which I still love. But for less than half the price vs a Panasonic top end 65\" model, it became a no brainer decision.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Terrific image, once settings are adjusted", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R2NYQ2A04UM2MG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like all recent Samsung LCD TVs, this is capable of producing a really fantastically lovely image once its settings are adjusted, but the settings it comes with from the factory are just terrible.  The first thing to do is to turn off, or use the Custom setting to turn way down, the motion-smoothing effects, which otherwise ruin the depth and look of every camera pan or track.  Next, adjust the backlight all the way up, and change color, contrast, and brightness to taste.  I found I needed to reduce the contrast and brightness significantly below the maximum, while using the black-level controls as well, to get a less artificially \"poppy\" image than the unit's default settings.  Sharpening also needed to be turned way down to reduce unpleasant artifacts and stay true to the source material.  There is still a bit of unevenness to the backlighting, even with the LED backlight, which surprises me -- the edges of the screen are sometimes noticeably brighter than the middle -- but it's quite easy to live with, for the most part, and produces a great picture once adjusted.  The speakers are also surprisingly okay for dialogue -- much better than those in slimmer units -- but really, anything this nice should be hooked up to a full speaker system for better enjoyment.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV!!!!", "Author": "Viktorija", "ReviewID": "R2D5WUE6TNVZA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV!!!

Even old movies look good on this TV. So, yes you can change the defaults to look more tv like but then what's the point of buying an HDTV when you want the picture to look like an old style tv. The whole point of HD is to have everything look as real as possible and this TV delivers that greatly. If you have no interest in 3D tv then this is the tv for you even if you want a 3D tv all you would have to buy is a 3DFury adapter and it can make this or any other TV a 3D TV in seconds for an extra couple of hundred bucks.

I looked it up on the (CNet) reviews and used their suggested settings.  IT LOOKS GREAT! I live in a rural area and use an Over-the-Air antenna - reception/tuning is FINE. I have hooked up an old DVD player to the composite (r/w/y) input and have no problems watching DVD movies.  I have also hooked a Magnavox 515 DVR in via the HDMI input and that works well, also.  The 2nd HDMI input was used for my HP laptop and that too works perfectly.  Additionally, I purchased a 3-to-1 HDMI switch in case I want to expand the number of HDMI ports.  The sound is just fine for about 75% of the shows we watch requiring a setting of only 17-22.  The other 25% are produced/broadcast so that they need more volume and the TV handles that pretty well, too.The only real negative is that the base stand feels pretty shakey, so I anchored the TV to the wall behind it via a bolt inserted into one of the holes for the wall mounting bracket and a tether extinding to a wall anchor.All in all, I think it's a KEEPER!", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "The perfect TV for what I want!

I went with Costco because I was able to take advantage of the cash back and the extra warranty coverage.Here's the short version:ProsFantastic picture quality! Blu ray movies are GORGEOUS and as a gamer I see no noticeable artifacting or tearing from the fast motion of games.Thin, lightweight, easy to calibrate (I used the Disney WOW blu ray and it was great for me. I don't want/need any crazy advanced calibration)Pros to me that might be cons to others:Not 3DNot \"smart\"Not Edge lit ( I'm no a/v expert but I've heard \"full array\" LEDs have less risk of negatives like light bleed that some edge lit TVs can suffer)2 HDMI inputs, that's all I needed! I have a blu ray player and an xbox, and eventually will just have an xbox one (or a Ps4) and the blu ray player will go awayCons:None (in my book, see pro's to me that might be cons to others in above list)Here's the longer story if you want more detail:I had a 50 inch Sony LCD rear projection that was a great TV for a long time but I've been wanting to upgrade to a 1080p TV for some time and I have no interest in a 3D TV or a smart TV. So it looked like a great opportunity to pick this TV for a great price and get exactly what I wanted.I mainly watch streaming shows, blu ray movies and play games on an xbox 360. The most important factors to me are great picture quality with minimal to zero blurring/artifacting from motion of games or sports. I did not want \"smart\" or \"3d\" or any of that.The TV was easy to set up. It's about 70 lbs so I just set it on it's side for a bit, screwed the stand on, and then put it up on the stand and it was ready to rock.Picture Quality:Right out of the box the picture was pretty darn good. I fired up Game of Thrones on HBO GO and it seemed some brighter areas of the picture were a little washed out. Sure enough when I ran through the Disney WOW calibration DVD I ended up bringing the brightness down a few clicks and that was really the only adjustment I needed to make. Once I started watching the blu ray samples on the Disney WOW disc I was blown away at the picture quality! Absolutely gorgeous with no noticeable artifacts whatsoever. I watched The Hobbit on blu ray and was amazed at how gorgeous it was.Sports/Gaming:As a sports and gaming fan a major concern for me is blurring or artifacts from fast motion. I watched plenty of hockey highlights as well as played some xbox on it and so far everything looks fantastic. No complaints at allViewing angle and distance:I read some reviews that the viewing angles aren't good on this TV but they look great to me. I stood off to either side of the TV (about 45 degrees off center) and didn't notice any picture degradation at all. My ouch is set up about 10 feet away from the TV and that's a good distance for viewing the 65\" screen. If you want to get more \"immersed\" you can move it up to about 5-6 feet away and there's no noticeable loss of picture quality and it's great for really getting into a movie or game.Some people complain about:2 HDMI inputs but this is all I need. I dont have cable so I just need a blu ray player and xbox hookup. Eventually when I upgrade to a gaming console that has blu ray built in I'll only need one hookupSound - I only tried the speakers for a little bit because I have a sound bar but I thought the speakers sounded really good. If anything they're probably missing some bottom end which is typical for built in speakers. Either way, I feel TVs like this deserve external sound anyway to really get that Home Theater experience. Personally, I'd rather have them start not including speakers at all in large TVs like this and save some money and put it toward better home theater speakersThat's about it.

Basically, they must rely on 3rd party freight shipping companies outside the normal FedEx/UPS/USPS services. These companies are supposed to bring the item to your home at a time window you choose when you order. I choose my delivery date as Dec 5, 2013 from 2-6PM. After that time had passed, I was on the phone to Amazon. They told me my TV was in my town, but held up due to weather. Fair enough, I could wait over the weekend and was told to expect a call the following Monday.Monday came and went with no TV. I followed up with Amazon on Tuesday and was told to wait through the end of the day on Thursday, a full week after the initial scheduled delivery. Starting to get annoyed I consented. Thursday, Dec 12, 2013 also came and went with no TV. That evening, I called Amazon again and was told they could not find my TV (shocker) and that they could only offer a refund on the item. So, basically, I missed my cyber monday deal because at that point, the price had gone back up to about $300 more (from multiple retailers). Upset, but determined to keep cool I accepted a refund.The next day, I was called by Amazon and told that I had to speak to a supervisor to process my refund because of the item amount. At that time, I grilled him on why I couldn't get an exchange instead. He was also mystified that I didn't have that option and investigated further. In the end, he was able to get an new TV sent as an exchange. Cool, I was told it would be there the following Wed, December 18, 2013, but I couldn't get a specific schedule. I would be contacted by the carrier for a delivery time.Wednesday came and went. I called Amazon that evening and was told the second item was now lost as well. Really? I took the refund and vowed to never older anything larger than a book from Amazon ever again. My wife, after stewing about it for several hours demanded we get our TV. This was late in the evening, but during that call we were told our TV was still en-route. Not really believing anything at this point we were told the refund would be processed and the TV was still being shipped to our house. Fine, we will believe it when we see it.6 Days later I helped 2 delivery guys bring this TV into our house. This was Dec 23, 2013. Hurray! Leaving the mess of the refund re-processing until after the holidays, we started enjoying our unicorn of a screen. A week later, having heard nothing from Amazon, and yet seeing the refund applied to our accounts, I reached out to them again. After a long 20 minute conversation stating that I owed Amazon money (instead of asking for another refund), I was routed to someone in retail sales that was able to reprocess the original payment.We still wonder to this day what would have happened if we never contacted them, the last time. Free TV? Possibly - though that wouldn't have been good karma.Think long and hard about a large item purchase from Amazon.

I can only guess the majority of these positive reviews are for the smaller tvs, which probably look better than the 65\" TV that I bought from Amazon (great price and service, by the way--my only regret is that I can't return the thing without paying a small fortune in shipping!)  The colors are off and no amount of calibrating and adjusting can make them right.  Believe me, I've spent hours looking up different suggestions and getting to know the TV's color controls far better than I ever wanted to.  Blacks are just gray, reds are muted, and movement is often blurry--like the TV can't keep up with the change of information.  Using the standard or dynamic visual modes results in brighter colors, but severe loss of information--even blurrier motion and distinct pixellation that looks nothing like a real picture.  The sound is just okay, though I prefer the speakers on my older TV.

I was leaning towards an Aquos because I have a 46\" at home from about 5 or 6 years ago that is only 60Hz but ZERO motion blur, it doesn't do that weird feels-like-you're-on-the-set thing, and has great overall picture quality. So I was leaning towards another Aquos. I went to the B&M; store that has that big blue and yellow logo and that ripoff \"product support team\" LOL. I stared at their wall of TVs and immediately started to agree with all the people complaining about modern Aquoses.I didn't want to spend more than $1000 on a TV but for fun I ventured down the wall to the right where the prices were going up and there's a lot more Samsungs...I started ruling out TVs based on picture quality ALONE not even looking at prices. I knew they'd be better farther to the right because it was going to the high-end end. BUT I was really blown away by this TV compared to the LG's, Sony's, VIZIO's (maybe? I forget if Vizio's were present). Basically the LG's were OKAY as were the Sony's. They were very grainy. Now I know this isn't scientific, but all had the same NON-HD connection; all had the same picture playing; and theoretically the grainy-ness wasn't something the store could mess with to make the more expensive TV's look better. The Aquos were terrible with motion blur. This is all in reference to TV's in that 800-1200 price range I was browsing. I came across these 4 Samsung's on the wall and after eliminating the 46 because it was too small and the 55 because it was too much, I found this price amazing for the picture quality!One thing to note: since they have these in B&M; stores, and now that the Blue&Yellow; store prices matches AMAZON, you should for sure go check it out in person! No joke, they are price matching Amazon, but that doesn't matter since they're the same $799 price now. Seriously, this TV is AMAZING. I bought it for $809 at first and $799 is like a candle on my birthday cupcake.One thing to note: when I'm watching a movie, I have to turn the TV volume all the way up just to hear all the dialogue. BUT the TV rattles any time there's bass playing in the music or like an explosion goes off. SO...you will definitely need some speakers to go with this TV but some of the Polk audio Monitor60 series II are on sale for $99 a pop, GO GET THEM! And let's not argue about which speakers to get, just go get some.Summary:-TV destroyed competitors in terms of what I was looking for (#1: no motion blur. #2: not grainy picture. (I notice if colors are WAY off, but unless you're watching 2 TV's to compare colors, I'm not that picky about them))-Bang for Buck is insane-Speakers need some backup-TV looks good off too-Remote is a remote-menu has been easy to navigate but that's not why I buy a TV-I turned off their \"smooth picture setting which made it look weird\"Recommend to a friend?

Being plugged into an Xbox One and a PlexApp Media Server, i don't want or need any of that stuff.  I just wanted a TV with HDMI and a beautiful picture and this set delivers.* Picture - Very vibrant colors, lots of options, lots of settings. You can enable/disable the 240hz motion display, set to Cinema mode and customize the colors/options very well.  Picture is nice and fast - BluRay looks absolutely amazing and the Xbox One really shines on this console at 32bit color depth, 1080p/60.* Size - its not a \"slim\" set by \"slim\" standards of today, but its much more slim and lighter than my old 37\" set it replaced.  It fit on my existing mount and installed without any hassle. The 50\" (49.5) panel is absolutely perfect if you ask me. Great viewing size, great with games, great with movies, great with my PC. I wouldn't want anything smaller and I'm not sure its worth paying more to go larger - most people go so large the issues of LCD / LED and even 1080p resolution come into fact and they don't know the larger the TV, the larger you may need to sit back to not see such artifacts..* Screen - There is a bit of reflection on the panel with daylight.. i haven't seen a panel that doesn't have this issue and really, after looking at my old tv, its only noticeable because this thing is just HUGE - more to reflect.* Remote - basic.. i won't use it much. I have mine connected to the Xbox One and it recognized the TV and allows me to use the voice and SmartGlass controls to control the TV.* Audio - I'm not using the Audio, I go from Xbox One to Receiver then TV - My Receiver does the audio decoding/playback. Sorry.. i'm just not investing in a 50\" TV to be stuck with 2 speaker audio and not sure why anyone would :)* HDMI Ports - It has two. That's it. I can't stand it when people know this and yet rate the tv negatively.  Go buy a receiver with multiple HDMI inputs and listen/watch/play on your TV in surround sound as it was meant to be :)* USB Port - Has a USB slot that will allow it to update firmware as well as play media.. I'll probably never use it, but its there.My TV was packed inside a separate shipping unit very nicely, I only had problem with the holiday shipping being delayed in Mesquite Texas during the UPS Holiday backup they had.

I'm not seeing feeling/seeing any latency from the Xbox One and the 1080p and even 720p games look absolutely beautiful, color rich and sharp sharp sharp!  Playing Forza 5 looks amazing, Max is crystal clear, Peggle two really pops on this display and Assassins Creed is just awesome.  I was able to set the Xbox One to 1080p, 32bit color depth and RGB colors. I also ran the Xbox One calibration tool to make sure the colors were sharp and detail was set as i wanted and after doing that, i was able to leave the HDMI port in Cinema mode and have everything look amazing.Have i said amazing enough yet? :)  No dead pixels, great packaging, easy install and I was gaming within 5 minutes of opening the box!", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent !!!!", "Author": "Rodman \"SixShooter\"", "ReviewID": "R33DP20DIDX1QS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV.

Brought home a Vizio and then a Toshiba that both went back to Costco. I could not get either of them dialed in. In frustration I started looking at plasmas but was quickly discouraged by the salesperson from that direction.At first getting the Samsung hooked up I thought I was doomed by having too high an expectation. I found several people's suggestions on calibration, tried them all, and finally settled on one that was closest to what I thought met my taste. The next couple of days I did some minor treaking and experimenting to fine tune everything. Once I was satisfied I went through the programming and logged all my settings in the event of power failure or whatever.One thing that really made a difference was originally I had it just hooked up with a coax cable from my Dish receiver through my home cable system. I moved the recever right next to the tv and used a HDMI cable directly from the receiver. VIOLA! That's what made the huge difference in the clarity of the picture. To bury the receiver in the cabinet I ordered a new remote from Dish so the receiver would work on UHF instead of infra red. Dish's 722 receiver only allows HDMI hookup on \"channel 1\" which is normally IR. Dish recommends RG6 cable which I don't have in my older home. Anyway, if you find an issue with your picture you may want to consider how you have it connected.I have no doubt that you would be happy with this tv. The amount of settings for picture and sound are plenty for all particular tastes. There are cheaper units out there. I ended up paying $850 (more than I really wanted to)but am totally satisfied with the product. I missed out on Costco's double warantee but have purchased the Square Trade 3 year extended warantee from Costco for $60. Hope this helps someone.

We often don't even bother to turn on the surround sound system, but just use the TV sound instead.

Everyone was in disbelief in the clarity of the film and made everyone jealous.We tried out the xbox360 and ps3 (COD:MW2 & Street Fighter 4) in Game Mode and it performed well, no complaints.

It might be a little hard to do so here.We bought this TV to replace a 6 year old, 42\" Sharp Aquos.  There was nothing wrong with the old TV, but wanted a new one for our bedroom.  Do we buy a new set with apps and all the latest features?  Do we buy a small one for our bedroom and just keep the one we have?  Seemed that the prices for smaller TVs (~30\") with high end features were just as expensive as their 42\" counterparts.  A high-end TV with all the apps, bells, and whistles was just way out of my price range.  I decided on this TV, choosing to move the older TV up into our bedroom and to use the Samsung as our main TV in our family room.I ordered from Amazon and paid the extra $3.99 (via amazon prime) for next day delivery as it fit my schedule.  Fed-ex delivered on time without issue.The picture is phenomenal!  We'll get used to it someday, I guess.  My wife and I are amazed at how realistic everything looks.  Everything seems to pop out... its not three-d, but it just seems real.  I don't know if its the higher contrast ratio compared to our old set, or the fact that we jumped from LCD to LED/LCD, but we just sat there wondering what it is that makes everything look so awesome.  The colors are fantastic and it can be very bright in the light scenes, while still maintaining an almost pure black (you can still tell the black is back-lit if you really try, but far darker than our old TV).  Since I have an XBOX, I popped in Skyrim and explored a little in a dark dungeon... I was impressed with the level of detail I could see that I was not aware existed.The sound was really good too.  Compared to the old Sharp, I was able to hear sounds in programs that I wasn't hearing before.This wouldn't be a full review without some kind of criticism, and there are two things I have to say... 1) The TV didn't come with bolts for mounting to a mounting rack.  After I pulled the old 42\" TV down (which weighed about 20 pounds more than the Samsung 50\"), I was disappointed that I couldn't mount the Samsung right away.  I had to run out to Lowes and get M8 3/4\" bolts and washers for about $3.  Then I was good to go.  2) The default color settings don't look all that great.  Doing a few searches for video settings on the EH6000 series, I was able to find some good recommendations for settings to use, then tweaked them to my liking.Weighing the pros and the cons, the cons aren't really a factor.  This television is rock solid, has a high refresh rate, and great picture and sound.  EPA estimates are that it will consume $11 per year of electricity!  I don't regret getting a TV without the apps and 3D.  I likely wouldn't use the 3D, and I have an Xbox to get things like netflix, amazon, and such.

This Tv was going to be for the loft, mainly used for gaming and watching sports/movies so I considered some plasmas but the loft is relatively a bright room so I just couldnt convince myself to try a plasma. Also, this Tv had the lowest input lag compared to other Tvs around the same size/price. So I got this 50\" model from BB the other day and have been playing BF4 on PS4. Ive been messing around with the settings and seeing what other people have done but I chose dynamic with some minor adjustments to other settings and the picture is great. I tried \"Game Mode\" but it looked terrible with BF4...maybe its better with some other games.ALSO the \"Auto Motion Plus\" is terrible with BF4. I tried all different settings with it, even custom, and they all look the same and they all created the blurred outline around the mini map and around the body when I would look down and run. But with AMP turned OFF all the blurriness went away. However, when watching ESPN, I switched AMP to the \"smooth\" setting and the info scrolling on the bottom of screen would scroll fine without any issues but with AMP turned OFF the words would struggle to move across the screen like they're supposed to. So Auto Motion Plus definitely makes a difference, for better or worse.The sound is alright, I have it set on Movie, but it still leaves much to be desired. But I use my headset w/ 7.1 dolby to play games and watch movies so that isn't an issue for me.

Why spend money on something that evolve so quickly and can be brought for a much cheaper price?This 65inch samsung would just be the TV you look for in a TV. Let me tell you, for a TV, the top three feature you are looking for are screen, screen, screen. Screen is everything. First of all, size does matter. The bigger the screen the better! No matter how small your living room is. Go for the largest screen you can afford. The large screen will blow you away - guaranteed! Second, look for the screen with good contrast. The OLED screen always have the best contrast because the black is true black, not greyish black. Some people think plasma is better than OLED. I deeply and profoundly disagree. My previous TV from Panasonic is a plasma, the picture contrast is far far worse than the OLED screen.Overall, this TV strips out all the none sense feature and kept the most important features the best.The only complain I have is the number of HDMIs.

There is judder that will not go away regardless of auto-motion on or off or changing HDMI cables or content, this has happened on HDTV programming, HTPC HD, and Blu-ray. The blooming and gradient blending is horrible especially on grays and blacks. And lastly because off the back-light bleeding, 2 inch thick line that goes down both right and left side of the screen. Only way to even slightly relieve these issues is to bring down the brightness, gamma, back-light so low the picture is ridiculously dark and even then when you turn off your room lights it is still noticeable. The one good surprise was the off axis viewing which was a lot better than expected and the screen seems to be semi-matte. I have the YH-01 Panel Manufactured this year, don't remember the month.

The physical appearance and quality are top notch.o The UN50EH6000 has an awesome full-array LED backlit picture that provides a great viewing experience with bright and vivid colors.o You MUST calibrate the television to get best picture customization to your personal preferences.o The infamous \"soap opera\" effect can be disabled. When enabled the picture has a surreal almost 3-D look that makes the characters pop out on the screen. It takes some getting used to but can be very interesting viewing experience.o The set has very basic features, only 2 HDMI inputs, not 3-D and not a smart TV. You will need to spend more to obtain the additional features. This entry level TV can provide much enjoyment if you don't need all the extras.Samsung makes a great product.

I paid 1700 for this and I think that it is a reasonable purchase. As with all Samsungs the picture is very reasonable, especially for movies. This is a limited full array TV, unlike all the other Samsungs which are edge lit. So it is a little thicker than for example the ES7500. It may be 3\" in thickness.  The positives are a nice picture, a nice price for a 65\". It has less clouding/flashlighting and to me the black levels are better than the edge-lit Samsungs. However it definitely has some of these same issues also. My guess is that the Sharp Elite and the Sony are better in this regard. However you are paying 3 - 4 times more for these latter two TV's.  The negatives are mainly that this TV has a lot of banding, during any scene where the camera rapidly pans right to left. This is seen when (especially) watching soccer or in some movie scenes. I had this problem with 2 65\" ES8000 and 2 65\" EH6500. I returned this TV once and the second one also had the same problem. That means 4 Samsung 65\" have the same banding problems. I assume and have read that all 65\" have this problem to some extent, even the sony 950.  The bottom line is that the picture is a nice bright one on most scenes, and the price is very reasonable. My plan is to use this for a few years, then upgrade to a 4K one once that technology becomes better developed and cheaper. For my purposes this is an excellent TV to act as a bridge until the arrival of 4K. If you have to have the perfect 65\" TV now then I would suggest another brand or the new F series from Samsung. I did not trust the F series initially after my experience with the ES series last year, which I believe Samsung put on the market with insufficient testing.  If you want a 60\" then I suggest the 60ES7500 - this is an excellent TV as per my review. For 65\" I would either go with this TV or risk the new 2013 F series.

We were fine without these options, since we only needed to connect cable and Apple TV.  We needed to get a fairly large TV because where we wanted to mount the TV would be pretty far from the seating area.

We had a Sony KF-60WE610 HDTV before this, but we never purchased the HD package from Uverse.  We just switched to Comcast when getting this TV.The picture is great and after using the settings that F.Maria (reviewer here on amazon), it made it even more to our taste.  The colors are vibrant, it's not too bright or not too dark.  The contrast and the black levels are to our liking.  Watching HD channels is GREAT!!!!  I have no idea why we never made the jump to HD sooner.As far as sound, as long as you not an audiophile, I think what this set can produce should be sufficient.  We purchased a sound bar thinking that this TV probably has some really small speakers, but we soon found out that the TV's sound performed very good without one.At first, we were planning on returning the TV because there was slight vertical banding that is noticeable while watching sports.  I was really annoyed that it was there, but we really enjoyed this TV so much that I started not to care that the banding was there.The remote control wasn't that hard to use.  However, we programmed the Comcast remote so we don't even use the Samsung remote anymore.So we had the TV for a few months, and had some friend and their son come over to play with our son.  An accident happened where a kid toy was flung towards the TV and cracked the screen.  It was pretty bad.  Had a Samsung tech come over, and they said It would have cost more to replace/fix than what we paid to purchase the TV.  Luckily I was able to find the same TV here on Amazon, USED from Blinq, for less than $1300.We got this TV and it barely even looked used.  Turned it on, and there was no Vertical banding on this one. The picture and sound was great.

I made note of the model and purchased a Samsung UN50EH6000 from Amazon for $739. The colors out of the box were truly bizarre. The motion was really funky too. Hats off to CNET for giving me some quick settings to base mine off of. Now tweaked, I'm completely satisfied with the colors, blacks, and the motion. Side by side, the new Samsung has a MUCH better picture than the old Samsung. I guess that's to be expected. I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get plasma quality, but the truth is, I never had any issues with the old Samsung's picture quality and the new one is so much better. What I am I complaining about?Okay, I do have a couple of tiny complaints. The blacks are not as deep or nuanced as I would like. Consequently, during dark scenes, things look a little muddy. It's not bad, but just not as good as the very best. The screen, while matte, is definitely more reflective than my old Samsung.I think it's bunk that people are complaining about the lack of HDMI ports. It's clearly stated before you purchase the TV.  Two HDMI and the composite suit my needs, if it didn't, I wouldn't have purchased it.Inexplicably, the price of this TV is now $949. I don't think I'd pay that much for it. At $739 I felt I was getting a good deal. At $949 I'd shop for something else. Maybe the cost of the humungous second box drove up the price $200?  It's only been a little bit, but for $739 this is a five star TV. For $949 I think you can do better and I'd only give it four stars.I feel like I've taken a real gamble buying another Samsung after my first one was of such shoddy build. Hopefully I won't get burned.EDIT:After a couple weeks of usage I've notice something, this TV is a DUST MAGNET. I've never seen any other object collect more dust. The screen seems normal enough, but the gloss plastic frame and stand collect huge amounts of dust. Admittedly, I'm not the best house keeper. But the entertainment center the TV rests on is dust free. I wonder if a matte plastic finish would attract less dust.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 'machine'", "Author": "Frank McGarry", "ReviewID": "R1DIAAIXXQPQWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent performance- as advertised.

And I literally spent thousands less than friends with a similar looking setup.  I already had a Phillips sound bar with subwoofer, and the sound bar sitting on the mantle under the TV hides the wiring, and looks and sounds great.  I used the picture settings suggested by others in Amazon reviews, and have been very pleased with the picture.As mentioned, I mounted the TV above the fireplace, but the mantle should deflect the heat enough to eliminate any temperature concerns.  I'll monitor that next winter, and adjust if I have to, but I'm not expecting problems.  And the hollow mantle and self adhesive corner wire covers (purchased at Best Buy) allow for a totally professional looking installation.  The wire covers can be painted to match your wall paint, and are not even noticeable.OK, nothing is ever perfect, so if I could do something different, what would it be?  I'd go bigger.  My two chairs that are most directly in front of the TV are 14 feet away.  I was concerned that the 55\" or 60\" would just appear a little too big for the brick wall over the fireplace, and the size of my den.  But I'm now convinced I should have gone bigger, even with the two side couches a little closer.  A great picture still needs to be viewed at the proper distance.  I can not over emphasize this.I know others have expressed a concern over just two HDMI ports on this TV.  Most sound systems have at least one HDMI input, and two HDMI outputs, so I connected the Directv directly to the TV, and the other port is connected to the sound system.  The Apple TV and Blue Ray are both connected to the sound system, so, if you have a sound system, no problem as far as I'm concerned.  And if you don't have a sound system, go get one, it makes a world of difference.  I bought mine for $99 at Sams a couple of years ago.Also, be sure to get \"airplay\" operational on your iphone.  You will be able to listen to any music, and view any pictures that you have on your iphone.  If you have a music subscription such as Rhapsody, like I do, you will literally have the entire universe of music on your TV.And one last comment.  Since Apple TV only cost $99, their 2 year warranty/technical assistance plan is only $29.00.

I used Dynamic for everything i watched on my Aquos and started off there just in time for Friday afternoon's coverage on ESPN. However, the colors were so blown out that i just couldn't see any detail. For example one of the players wore a red shirt and it looked almost fluorescent. And then when the ball was rolling over the green there was no definition or detail to the the grass until the camera stilled.Now, I know this is LED and motion blur is part of the package, but I had better results with my old 60hz refresh Aquos. I had anticipated way better performance with 120hz and Samsung's promised 240 clear motion rate. I tried to adjust all the settings, motion blur on/off (On just made the whole screen too dark), auto motion settings did either nothing, or on 'custom' made the image very jerky. For example on a golf swing it looked like you were only seeing every second frame or something - very odd.I found the optimal calibration settings online and they all indicated Movie mode was the way to go, but for me this made the picture look very dull and lacked any 'pop'.By that evening I had become obsessed with this settings conundrum and eventually after many hours settled on a 'Standard' setting with a lot of tweaks which worked fine - not great - just ok. However come Saturday morning and viewing the TV in daylight conditions I needed the dynamic settings back. In standard the colors were very weak and washed out. With the black level increased i got more realistic colors, but the shadows all looked way too dark.Sunday at Augusta was rainy and overcast and I spent most of the afternoon trying to find a combination of settings that didn't blur too much, but still provide decent color reproduction. Unfortunately i couldn't find anything that worked to my satisfaction.On Monday evening i was watching another show and it looked as if it had been filmed in cheap, daytime soap opera mode. Very washed out colors and a lot of motion drag.Having spent way too many hours on this i decided to return the TV and get a Panasonic Viera plasma instead. The difference is staggering. I had the colors set the way i wanted in about 5 minutes, but the difference was all the options looked fine, it was just a case of selecting my favorite combination.The one thing that held me back from Plasma was the glare problem, but i have to say i am getting less of that with the Viera than i had with the Samsung. On balance I would say my old LCD Aquos handled that issue better, but I am so happy with the sharp motion clarity in the plasma that i can take a little bit of reflection.In conclusion, if you are looking for a TV to give you consistent viewing of golf (or any other sports) and don't want to spend half your time trying to find acceptable picture settings DO NOT buy this Samsung. Maybe other more expensive LED's perform better, but after my experiences I don't believe they can touch a decent plasma.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Clean unit.

Also, the position of the HDMI inputs is awkward on the side.  If you're mounting the TV, you will be able to see those cords pretty clearly.  Other than that, I have no complaints with the picture - everything that's 1080 is quite crisp.  If you don't have a receiver, the built-in audio is decent.Completely unrelated, and sadly prompted by a recent home break-in: always record the serial number of your TV and keep the box and manual.

Thanks to a customer comment and MUCH to my suprise, I rubbed the screen with a soft flanel and felt the screen reseat into the frame.  There must have been a slight air gap between assembly layers from shipping or setup that was causing the light bean shape in dark sceens.  The problem has been fixed and hopefully fixes it for good. I'll update the customer photos soon.Last spring I purchased the 40\" Samsung 40ES6500 smart TV and love the picture but don't use the smart TV features.  When I saw the 65EH6000 model for about $1,000 cheaper than the equivalent sized 65es6500 model, I was hoping for the same quality picture minus the smart TV and extra inputs I do not need.

Samsung TVs get great reviews on Amazon which factored my decision on purchasing this one.  Even after calibrating, the picture is really bad. HD doesn't look HD at all and yes we have an HDMI very good cable. I have since read that Toshibas use lower quality panels. My version is a C and that might be the picture problem. We have a picture window and this Samsung TV reflects the window in the day even with blinds closed and at night I can plainly see my lamp in the TV. We didn't have that problem with our Toshiba. Does anyone have recommendations for Tv's that do not reflect windows etc?? What Tv has the sharpest HD picture?This TV is going back to Walmart asap !

Don't fall for this. Just don't buy their products.They refuse to honor warranties, from what I can tell.The problem? My remote control power button stopped working. Second TV remote in a row that has done this with a Samsung TV. They just aren't built well. In both cases it was right around one year. If you do buy a Samsung TV, just before your warranty expires, request that they replace your remote... you can at least get another year out of it before paying for repairs.If you are not a technical person, don't buy this TV. The setup is not intuitive and is a real hassle. When I called to get some basic info I had the same phone support problems as noted above.

After a long thought process decided to buy it from Amazon though the same offer was available from other local companies. First, the product got delayed - Thanks-giving order reached us only this week. Second the delivery truck which brought the TV had just the driver. I have ended up in helping him to move the TV from outside to all the way to room. I was planning to leave my old in-laws at home for delivery but at last minute I changed and now I think that it is a great idea. Otherwise my in laws would have ended in lifting the TV. I could not imagine how difficult it would be when it is quite difficult for me to lift it. Third - I was fully charged that i got this new piece. The person accompanied said that he will show the TV for checking and asked me to show the power plug. We both lifted the TV and he connected it to the plug and asked me to check it - We need to first rest the TV somewhere safe, so that we can check it properly. He rested it against the wall and asked me to check it- looks like he was in a hurry. I thought the customer service was the best piece in Amazon but did not feel that way when i bought this item.  I would have expected to delivery  person to put the TV on some on the stand so that we can properly check everything.There is quick fix stand with the TV and it would have taken only 5 minutes to fix it.Overall the delivery experience is very bad for me this time.
