First off I notice major black light bleed out of the box & even after tweaking the TV on my own until I found the right settings from a other users.What I really like about this tv is that my playstation 3 is synced with the tv. My tv come's on when the playstation is turned on and I can control my ps3 with my Samsung remote nice feature.  The tv is nice a thin not very heavy. The 2d to 3d conversion is total crap some stuff looks good but for the most part it's a BIG gimmick. Movies & stuff filmed in 3D look amazing sometimes it's a hit & miss. So far my favorite 3d movies are : ( Monsters Vs Aliens ) ( avatar ) ( Despicable me )  Resident evil looked like crap & I really didn't like monster house. I am hoping the studios will improve 3D filming and make live action films pop out more. I tried some playstation 3 games in 3d I like the idea but WoW it really makes your eyes hurt after awhile.Setting up the tv was pretty easy I did found setting up the wireless on the Tv to be a real pain. I am pretty good with computers and wireless network it was still a pain. I have a netgear router and I was not able to link it with normal settings the tv kept saying my pass word was wrong password ended up doing the button method on my router and samsung tv. Right away the Tv found the router and no more issues.Now for the calibration settings that will make your set look amazing and reduce the famous Samsung clouding issue and black light bleeding which I couldn't stand until this ! Make sure you have a hdmi 1.4 cable I did notice a issue with my old hdmi cable and the 1.4 cable solved the slow lag, any cheap one will do as long as it's 1.4PICTUREPicture Mode MovieBacklight 8 (3D: 11)Contrast 92Brightness 48Sharpness 15Color 50Tint 50/50ADVANCEDBlack Tone OffDynamic Contrast OffShadow Detail 0Gamma 0Color Space CustomFlesh Tone 0Edge Enhancement OffMotion Lighting Off  <<<< THIS IS WHAT CAUSES CLOUDING I THINKxvYCC OffLed Motion Plus OffPICTURE OPTIONSColour Tone Warm2Digital Noise Filter OffMpeg Noise Filter OffHDMI Black level LowFilm Mode n/aMotion Plus Clear  R G BColour Space Red 58 2 0Colour Space Green 0 58 9Colour Space Blue 7 0 54Colour Space Yellow 48 53 7Colour Space Cyan 0 54 58Colour Space Magenta 56 4 45R-Offset 20G-Offset 24B-Offset 24R-Gain 19G-Gain 26B-Gain 25  R G B1 5 1 -22 2 0 -13 0 0 -14 -2 -3 -35 0 -2 -36 1 1 -47 2 3 08 1 2 09 -1 2 210 0 1 1Make sure you select each color in the color space and enter them like above.

After I changed the usage mode to 'home', it decreased considerably but was still noticeable.I visited some forums, websites, and some even advised to put pressure on the screen with my fingers (until I see the screen changing colors), etc, but nothing seemed to work.I decided to contact Samsung support and they advised me to change PICTURE MODE to 'STANDARD' and adjust the 'BACKLIGHT' to the value of '7'. The support guy/girl mentioned to leave this setting on for 3 weeks. After the three weeks, I should be able to change to any picture mode and to any value for the backlight. Finally, it was mentioned that if I did not see any changes, that a service ticket needs to be placed at this link (you will need to register your TV with Samsung): [...]I made the change today 4/15/2011 so I will wright another review within 3 weeks to let you know the end results.2) Sound stops working - I only have a PS3 and a DirecTV satellite box connected to the TV via HDMI cables (hight speed and 3D capable). I have noticed the TV produces no sound for like 1 second and then gradually comes back at a lower volume until it reaches the original volume. I have also noticed it only happens when the picture is set to 'STANDARD' and have only noticed it when the source is the DirecTV box.I do not run the PS3 on standard mode so I can't compare, but I will do so and pay attention to the results.In summary, I have to wait for the 3 weeks picture test, and also test the sound using the PS3 source on standard mode.I know it's a hassle but for a TV that costs over $2000, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get a \"perfect\" picture and normal working sound (although you would not expect to do this since you are paying a lot of money)...And if you got this TV from Paul'sTV (whether by Amazon's reseller program or directly from them) expect to pay 15% restocking fee and $100 shipping if you plan to return it.Hope this helps and please post any questions/comments you may have, and I will try to answer them as soon as possible.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV... If there is no flaw.", "Author": "N.A", "ReviewID": "R2WIQZZ1KDZG5J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just got the TV in today, and from I experience so far is that this TV is amazing.Black level is great! One of the best I seen so far.Internet connection is great on the TV. Very useful for watching Netflix.The qwerty remotes that came with my TV is very useful for web browsing, but don't expect the browser to be like normal computer browser because it is very bad, slow, hard to navigate, and cumbersome.For gaming, in my opinion, there is no lag if you turn off the picture enhancements options, and also turning on the game mode. I would say the lag on the TV would be probably somewhere between 30-50ms.3D is great! I watched Shrek 3D, and it's just stunning. A major improvement from last year model. I probably will buy Tron 3D, and see it on the TV soon.Cons: HDMI input is located on the side. Clouding & Flashlighting that can be seen in dark screen.Update: After 2 weeks of having the TV I noticed some flash lighting / clouding that can be seen in pitch black room. Not a big deal at first, but overtime I am starting to be annoyed by it. I am thinking of getting it exchange for higher end model. Therefore I am rating the TV 3/5 stars. If would be a solid 5 stars if there is no flaw.Update 2:  Returned my set and bought 46\" Sony HX929.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "The new Gold Standard of TV's", "Author": "Joseph L Cooke", "ReviewID": "R2V0O5KF88JVE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The short version: FantasticI don't care about 3D. If it weren't for thrusting swords pointed at the audience, there would be no 3D content. But, in order to get the best picture today's technology has to offer, you have to buy the 3D feature. I hate the manufacturers for doing this to the public, but they have a lot of money riding on the success of 3D. Well, 3D ain't going to happen for them in any great numbers.I compared many big display TV's, but I kept returning to the D7000. It looked stylish and the picture was just outstanding. I had a salesman plug in a blu-ray player to several TV's and I fine tuned them all, but when all was said and done, the Samsung had that something extra than I could not quantify.  Two days later it was in my living room.The TV is slow to turn on. It is not instant-on. I hate that. There is only so much time you get in this life and using that precious time waiting for a TV to come is a waste. Samsung engineers need to do better. Anyway, give it at least five seconds for the picture to appear. When going online with the TV, another five or ten seconds are required. Tick. Tick. Tick.Upon its arrival I plugged in the Dishnetwork receiver. History HD had some landscape shots on that looked so good, I had to gasp. My test Blu-Ray is HD Mood Aquarium and the colors from it just leaped from the screen.As I become more familiar with this model, I'll post updates on josephlcooke dot blogspot dot c0mBy intuition (the manual is in the TV's firmware and it stinks) you can fine tune the D7000 in more ways than you can imagine. Search the web for a PDF manual for 55\" D7000 to get an idea of this set's flexibility as the two have similar operational characteristics.I easily got the wireless internet connection established. (later I went to a wired connection because it is 5 times faster than my G router) The Smart Hub browser is clunky (perhaps it's still too new for me) to use and the browser does not support Java. Dumb. Very dumb. To have a TV this great and not have Java in its browser screams, STUPID. The main Smart Hub screen is crowded with pushed content that cannot be deleted. Users need to have more control here. One thing you will learn to hate with the Smart Hub browser is the frequently displayed message: Plug In Not Supported. Another message users will tire of is: The Browser Will Stop Loading All Windows For Stable Browsing; despite only one window being open. Come on, Samsung, get with it! Make the browser useable.The remote ( Samsung QWERTY Remote BN59-01134B RMC-QTD1 ) is two sided. One side is for the TV, the other, for the internet. It has a full QWERTY keyboard and a touch pad that is half the size of the fingernail on your pinkie. And, it works. It takes practice, but it works. The TV side of the remote is infrared and the internet side is RF.  The RF side of the remote has to be paired with the TV. Hint: The remote must be within a few inches of the TV or it will not pair. My wife discovered this ahead of time in an obscure online posting during her research of the D7000. This critical bit of info is not in the manual. Lastly, aiming the infrared side of the remote must be directly at the sensor on the lower right side of the display or you'll not have a remote control function.After owning it for awhile, I remain in awe of the picture quality of the D7000. Despite a quirk here and there, it's a keeper.Update: The length of time it takes the TV to turn on has turned out to be a real irritant, so I not longer turn it off and just mute the audio.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Back light issues Nice remote and beautiful design", "Author": "AZ Mutley", "ReviewID": "R3J8TP2SCR76FH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, this is my second Samsung LCD TV, I still have my old LN52A650A in the back room, where it needs to be as it wasn't bright enough to work in full sunlight. That has been my only complaint of that TV, the need to shut the curtains to cut the reflection off the glossy screen.When I saw this new LED lit 55\" designers dream in Best Buy I was amazed at how great the picture looked. It also did 3D so that was it, bigger brighter and 3D, for about the same price I'd paid in 2008.. I ordered one the next day.When it arrived it as well packaged, easily assembled (the stand took about 3 minutes) and up and running with my PS3 bluray in minutes, no fuss.The first thing I watched was Avatar, AMAZING. The second film was Kick Ass, where I noticed the movie sometimes had a larger than life quality to it, almost like a High Def home video, but not really a problem.The issues started when I watched Ticking Clock on blu ray. It had many darkened scenes and I could see LED light seeping in from the corners, and at times I could see grid of leaking light coming though the movie. I thought it might be that particular disc. A few nights later I watched disc one of Mad Men on Bluray, and all manner of leaking light during darker scenes.. Finally I watched a letter boxed DVD and that was too much, blooms of light in all four corners and I had the set turned to movie mode, which is the least back lighting. So I played about with the presets modes and none of them really overcame the problem.It's a shame as the set looks FANTASTIC, it is so thin it virtually disappears as you pass it by. There is pretty much zero bezel, which is amazing. I actually got the tape measure out as I was thinking it was smaller than 55\", but no.2 other cons I found, that were not deal breakers per say. Netflix had an annoying habit of dropping the picture momentarily every couple of minutes, which was annoying.. but since the PC streams Netflix at closer to HD than the TV will I did not really care too much.Con number 2, I could not make the qwerty keypad on the back of the remote sync with the TV. This looks like a very useful remote function indeed if it had worked. The Smart TV has a host of internet enabled services that were awesome.So it's going back tomorrow when the Pilot folks arrive and being replaced with a 60\" Quatron, that I have reviewed at a friends house, and did not display edge leakage. Hopefully that will be it as far as getting a nice 3D tv for now.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Magnificent!!!!!", "Author": "Craig", "ReviewID": "RET13V40QJSME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has to be the most spectacular TV I have ever seen. While I am sure it is not for everyone, it is the perfect TV for my home.To begin with, I think the first thing people need to decide is what their priority is. I think every TV purchase has to include five factors, the picture, the sound, the design, the functions, and the cost. Many reviewers seem to focus on only the picture and not the other factors, so if you are considering this TV, be sure to read reviews that agree with your priorities. I am not by any means a videophile, but I do love technology and I like gadgets that are really cool, and this TV certainly has that. For me, this TV meets my criteria for picture, sound, function and design. While the price is high, it is no more than I paid for my last HDTV.In terms of picture quality, I think it is spectacular. Many reviewers are only concerned about the picture, and if that is your case then a different TV might be for you. CNET's Best 5 HDTV Picture Quality list from 11/28/11 includes Panasonic VIERA TC-P55VT30 55-inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV, Black ; Samsung PN51D7000 51-Inch 1080p 600Hz 3D Plasma HDTV (Black) ; Samsung PN51D8000 51-inch 1080p 3D Ready Plasma HDTV ;Sony BRAVIA XBR55HX929 55-Inch 1080p 3D Local-Dimming LED HDTV with Built-In Wi-Fi, Black ; Panasonic VIERA TC-P46ST30 46-Inch 1080p 600 Hz 3D Plasma HDTV. This TV is not on the list, but those reviews are weighted toward picture quality, and are almost all plasma TVs.I personally think the picture quality is fantastic. The clearview glass does cut down on reflections. Not as much as an antiglare matte screen, but very good nonetheless. The screen, even without the 3D, seems to add more depth to the images than our other TVs (Toshiba LCD, Philips LCD, and Philips Plasma). Movies almost look like plays since the image is so clear. While some feel 3D is a gimmick, that was the only reason I wanted to upgrade our current TV. The 3D on this set is amazing. Additionally, it has a 2D-3D conversion that is really good. I used it to watch network programming and was surprised by how well the conversion worked. I also used it to play Skyrim on my XBox and it was fantastic. The main concerns that I have read about this TV's picture is variability in the blackness of the screen when the screen is dark, as well as some leakage of light from the edge of the screen. This TV has an excellent black level. It is considerably darker that my other TV's. I bought this in November 2011 from Amazon, and received the H302 screen. There is some internet buzz about the H303 being better than the H301 or H302 screens. When I first set this TV up, I did notice that when the screen is all black, which happen with some frequency during game transitions while playing Skyrim, that the screen was mottled. It was only visible when the screen was all black, so not even visible 99% of the time. I was quite concerned at first since I had read reviews about this problem, but honestly I am not sure I would have noticed if I hadn't read reviews about it and specifically looked for it. I read one comment on a samsung question site that reported that this is normal temporary phenomenon when the TV is transitioning from shipping to home due to environmental changes, humidity etc. However, after seeing so many reviews about this online, I did not expect it to go away. To my surprise, it was virtually gone the next day, and was completely gone within 48 hours. I could only see it at night with all the lights out anyway, but was pleased that it resolved. Now the screen blackness is just as uniform as my other tv's, just much darker. The other thing some people complain of is leakage of light from the edge lit screen. There are videos of this on YouTube, but I don't really see that on my TV.I love the sound on this TV. It is much clearer than any other TV we have, especially for voice. Music on Pandora radio was a pleasure to listen to. I prefer not to have an external sound component, so I was thrilled to see how much better the sound could be in a TV without having to go to a sound bar. While I am sure a soundbar is nice, I prefer not having extra hardware. The TV also has a different sound setting for 3D to make closer objects sound closer which was a detail I appreciated.As far as design, I don't think there is any TV on the market that compares to the elegance of this TV. It is superthin, and gives the appearance of a picture floating in the air. For me, it was a way to get a much bigger TV 55 inches in a space I previously had a 46 inch TV and could maximally fit 50 inches. However, the lack of a black from around the picture seems to add something to the experience. It really does seem more like a window than a TV. I was considering the D8000 model, but CNET actually felt the picture quality was the same and they said they felt the D7000 was a better looking TV. I went to Best Buy and agreed. The D7000 has a translucent bezel, and the D8000 has a chrome bezel. The translucent bezel actually looks smaller even though it is the same size, so it looks better to me, and saved me a couple hundred dollars.As far as features, the main feature is the Smart TV with a unique remote. The Smart TV function responds faster than other TV's, but not nearly as fast as a computer or iPad. It has an assortment of apps. I was surprised that it does not currently include amazon video on demand in the smart TV hub, or in the Yahoo Widgets Hub, which was a little diappointing for me. It has Netflix, Hulu, Blockbuster, and VuDu apps. I think I will most likely just use pandora though. It also has Yahoo Widgets which is a bar of apps that you can bring up on the bottom of the screen while watching a show. I liked the Yahoo Widget function more than the Samsung Smart TV hub, but I am sure these things will change with firmware updates.The 3D feature is very good. The glasses automatically registered to the TV and turn off as soon as you turn off 3D. The TV uses bluetooth technology so last years samsung glasses won't work. The glasses Samsung SSG-3100GB 3D Active Glasses - Black (Only Compatible with 2011 3D TVs) ; 3ACTIVE 3D Glasses for Samsung. Compatible with 2011 \"D\" Model TV's. Rechargeable. ADULT ; Samsung SSG-P3100M Megamind 3D Starter Kit - Black (Compatible with 2011 3D TVs) ; Samsung SSG-3300CR 3D Active Glasses - White (Compatible with 2011 3D TVs) ; Samsung SSG-3500CR 3D Active Glasses are sold separately.The remote control has two sides, one side has a qwerty keyboard, the other a regular remote. It has a sensor in it so the side on the bottom is always deactivated so you can't accidently push buttons on one side while using the other. The usual remote which is infrared works out of the box. The qwerty side requires bluetooth registration with the TV which worked well. The TV also supports a samsung remote app on an iphone or android phone. It works well as long as the TV is on. It cannot be used to turn the TV on.My main gripe about this TV is it doesn't include a real instruction manual, just setup instructions. I like to read the instruction manual and reference it when I am adjusting the settings. The remote has an \"E-Manual\" button which brings up a manual on the screen, but you can't adjust the TV settings while using this manual so it is a bit awkward. Also, there really is no instruction on adjusting the remote, so I can't use the remote to control my comcast box, and I don't even know if the remote can be programmed in such a way.As far as cost, it seems well priced to me since it seems to be so much less than MSRP. It is feature rich and compares favorably to similarly priced sets.In summary, there are much cheaper TV's on the market with excellent pictures to consider, but they don't offer the complete package that this one does. If you want a truely beautiful television, that is rich with features, with a great picture, that allows you to put a bigger screen in a smaller space, then this is it. This TV clearly raises the bar in the design of TV's with its narrow bezel, and because it is so unique, really has the WOW factor. There are many reviewers who have criticized this set, saying it is too expensive for the picture quality it offers. I think these are mostly unfounded since this set really offers so much more in design/features. I think the picture quality is outstanding. A Panasonic VT series plasma may have a better picture in the reviewers eyes (personally I don't agree), but it just looks like an ordinary flat panel TV. I am sure there may be compromises in making the bezel so small, and TV so narrow, but to me the TV design was worth it. I couldn't fit a 55 inch TV without the narrow bezel design.Addendum:I have now had my TV for a month and am still in awe when I watch it. I wanted to comment on my experience on TV settings. I found this TV fantastic out of the box. Of course with all of the settings to dabble with, I couldn't help but try. I tried the online settings and the most popular ones on amazon reviews, but they made my TV seem darker than I like. I then bought the Disney WOW: World of Wonder [Blu-ray]  . This actually made my old LCD really look great, but it didn't make a huge difference for this TV as I really like the TV set with the factory \"natural\" setting. I did change motion plus to clear and kept the tint at G55:R45 suggested by the Disney WOW disk.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV", "Author": "Curtis Barton", "ReviewID": "R3SUIT9SL4KFF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV shipped to me in excellent condition. It was very easy to unbox and get it set up. Not too heavy or unweildy despite the large size. I was able to move it from the box to the TV stand by myself.Setup: It is set up running with a TIVO and Samsung 3D BluRay disc player. Those connect to a Marantz SR-5005 receiver via HDMI which connects to the TV via HDMI.Settings: Watch it on movie video mode. I don't use the internal speakers because I have surround sound.Picture: It is better looking than our Sharp 26 inch LCD and Samsung 42 inch plasma. The colors are very crisp. The blacks are rich and deep. It's a joy to watch hi definition shows on this tv. The few shows that are standard definition still look great in this tv. It is a great screen.Features: 3d has been really good. It's easy to turn on the 3d function and to turn it off. The glasses which came with a special promotion (not included with this tv when we got it) work seamlessly with the TV. I haven't watched a movie with the 3D yet, but I probably will at some point. I watched soccer from ESPN 3D and that was sort of fun.I don't have any regrets about this TV. If anything changes I will update this review. Even if 3D isn't something you are looking for it is important to remember that 3D is simply a feature. The best 2D pictures come on TVs that have 3D options on them. If you never watch 3D, this TV will still be a great option.Edited to add:I forgot to mention that the remote control is pretty nice. I don't use the tv remote a lot because I use the Tivo remote. But for times when I need to use the tv remote it's nice. Especially if I'm watching netflix and want to search. It's easy to use the QWERTY keypad on the back of the remote.Another reviewer didn't like how long it takes for the tv to start up. I haven't noticed that as a problem. Perhaps that is because I'm used to watching a plasma tv which took a little bit of time to get going. My TV seems to start quite quickly.Firmware upgrades: These are flawless. I have wifi, so I have the TV set to automatically connect with the wifi in my house. The TV will download new firmware while the TV is on standby if you allow this option. Then it'll tell you when it's ready for the TV to upgrade itself with the new firmware. Great way to keep the the TV software current.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "UN55D7000 a phenomenal TV that's almost perfect", "Author": "Adam Rubinstein \"Dr. R.\"", "ReviewID": "R6QNMM8W8FMJY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The UND series is the 2011 successor to the successful UNC line of LED TV's.  There's little question that Samsung is the leader in innovation in this market and the UN55D7000 is no exception.  Encased in an acrylic frame, the UN55D7000 is stylish, thin, and lightweight.  The TV mounts easily to any wall mount or the included chrome x-style stand.  Set-up is relatively straight forward and the TV will update its software via Wifi or LAN (connection to an antenna input is not necessary contrary to the manual's reference).  Overall, picture quality is nothing short of phenomenal for an LED/LCD.  Colors are vivid, albeit a bit oversaturated on the default settings with outstanding contrast and no visible ghosting.  Glare is essentially non-existent and is one aspect of the Samsung TV panels that is truly exceptional.  As others have noted like all current LED TV's, the UN55D7000 suffers from some edge light leak or clouding when the screen is black.  If these are issues for you, skip the current LED's and consider a plasma though they come with their own respective drawbacks and issues.  The micro-dimming is ok though I find that it tends to reduce brightness a bit too quickly as ambient light decreases.  3D is gimicky and not really worthy of discussion.The UN55D7000 boots up reasonably quickly, is extremely quiet, and runs cool.  I say \"boots up\" because Samsung realizes that TV's are now morphing into visual work stations.  Are we there yet?  Not quite, but it's close.  The UN55D7000 sports 4 HDMI connectors, a pair of USB's, a variety of other connectors including optical, DVI, pass throughs, etc. and it manages them well.  Like all other TV's in this category, the sound is just ok.  If you are looking for premium acoustics, think sound bar or surround.Samsung has yet to produce logical, computer like, simple navigation and the various controls are buried under a variety of  different menus.  I'm under the impression that they have chosen to add features and processes in layers rather than producing a coherent OS - is it Android?  Nonetheless, it's a very nifty TV that can easily be used to Web browse, display pictures, stream music/videos, and run some interesting Apps.  The offerings aren't on the level of the Apple store or Android market but one can use the TV for google talk, facebook, netflix, twitter, youtube, and some other interesting things and the browser is reasonably robust - one can even do PIP while browsing.  Also, Samsung has their own network but the content is lacking and it is essentially advertisements for their own products.  They also offer some e-help videos and an e-manual but I found their utility questionable.  I've yet to encounter a system hang, serious crash, and since it isn't windoze based the blue screen of death is not an option.All of the system's controls are managed by a proprietary remote/controller.  One side is a conventional remote while the other offers a qwerty style keyboard for data entry and an optical trackball like sensor that simulates a mouse pointer.  The keyboard is a bit tight and slow, and it would be nice if Samsung would allow one to tether a wireless keyboard via one of the USB ports.  As such it means keeping another controller around exclusively for this system.So to summarize:PRO's:1) Phenomenal LCD Picture2) Seamless and functional Wireless/Networking3) Web Browser/multiple AppsCONS:1) Clouding/light leak2) Not quite a work station3) Proprietary remote/cryptic menusIf one could, I would rate the TV 4.5 stars but I give it 4 because while the UN55D7000 is clearly one of the nicest LED TV's on the market, it just misses the mark for being a shade less than perfect.  Priced several hundred dollars less than the top of the line 8000 series, the 7000 series offers almost all of the bang for a slightly smaller bite out of the wallet.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overall Great TV!!!", "Author": "ilpadrino5", "ReviewID": "RVGNRQO281V1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me caveat by saying I reviewed dozens of TV's and relied heavily on reviews prior to purchasing this TV.  I think it's important to actually read the reviews, rather than relying on average ratings.  Albeit there are defective products sold from time to time, many negative reviews are obviously effects from operator error, improper installation/use, etc.  Enough said.To begin, this TV is part of a home theater system which comprises a pair of Bose 301 V5 bookshelf speakers, a Sony SDRDH520 7.1CH 3D receiver, a Yamaha NS-C210BR center speaker and Klipsch in-wall speakers.  Primary input source is HD Directv.  Again, going to back to other reviews, it kills me when reading a review about a 1.2\" thick TV where the reviewer complains about the sound.  Really?  If you're not setting this TV up as part of a home theater system, you're buying the wrong TV.  Also, please splurge a little and don't buy the cheapest HDMI cables on the rack.  No need to spend $200 on cables, but you get my point.Looks: Killer... this has to be near the top of the list and primarily driving my 5-star review.  The screen goes almost completely to the edge and the thin silver frame looks like a work of art mounted above the fireplace.  There are just no comparisons with other plasma TV's out there and most other LED TV's fall way short in the \"looks\" department.  For you married folks out there, my wife loves the appearance; it is super-sleek.Performance: After mounting and hooking everything up, I used the specs posted by CrazyShopper918 on 5/28/11 (Thanks, by the way!).  The picture quality is phenomenal and I've had no issues with bleeding, distortion, backlight effects, or anything of the like.  One difference: most calibration recommendations I read pointed to \"Movie\" picture mode.  I guess it is the lighting in our den, but I found \"Dynamic\" picture mode produced the most vibrant colors.  Small caveat: when the TV is receiving an input and the screen is black (i.e. just before a movie/show or in between commercials) there are some minor differences between the blacks.  Again, if you want to sit in front of this gorgeous TV and look at a black screen and post a negative review, feel free.  For the rest of us (those who actually desire to view moving images), the image quality is impressive.  I ran several tests via Directv with various HD sports, nature shows and the original Transformers movie (all in 1080i), and saw no lag, blurring, etc.  The screen performed above and beyond.  From a normal sitting distance, even 720p/i resolution looks good, but you need 1080p/i to fully appreciate this TV.  In summary, I highly recommend the settings mentioned above, but you might need to tweak them a little in order to get the best picture for your room.  I have not viewed an on-demand movie in 1080p yet, but I'm confident it will render flawlessly.Other: Wireless connected to home WAN on 2nd attempt.  The AnyNet feature is great, as it lets you control multiple components of a home theater system via one remote through the TV (I'm using my stock Directv remote for everything).  Why does this matter?  This means you don't have to buy an expensive all-in-one remote and program it or keep multiple remotes handy.  Also, my receiver (non-Samsung, by the way) is hidden in a cabinet, so it is nice to close the cabinet door immediately after turning it on.  I do not have to keep the receiver out on a shelf or in a glass-front cabinet.  I've fooled around with the apps a bit, and most seem to load quickly.  The browser did take a while to load, but I did not buy this TV to peruse the Internet.  Mounting was easy, as the TV weighs only ~35 lbs... sure as hell beats trying to mount an 80 lb plasma.  I used one of the compatible ~$20 ultra-slim mounts found on Amazon... no need to buy the expensive Samsung mount.  Quick note on programmable remotes: the Samsung \"D\" series was not available in the Directv menu, so I selected the \"C\" equivalent and everything works fine.Summary: I am one of those \"middle of the road\" guys who wanted a nice TV to anchor a home theater system, but did not want to spend $3 - $5K.  So far, this TV has exceeded my expectations from a performance standpoint and it looks phenomenal even when turned off.  I would have purchased the 60\" model, but the frame above our fireplace limited me to the 55\" model.  So glad football season is right around the corner.Hope this helps!", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simply a well defined TV", "Author": "Big Al", "ReviewID": "R30B0J6TRVT1AE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a 2004 Sony 60\" KDF-60X955 DLP TV.  The TV was on last leg about one year ago when I started to see blue color at the lower right hand corner of the screen.  I was looking at Samsung UN55-C8000 since last Xmas.  I hestitated to buy it back then because of the hefty price tag.  When UN55-D7000 first came out, I bought it from Amazon.com.  I love the slim 0.5\" frame and 1.2\" depth of the TV.  Next, I was looking at contrast ratio.  I saw it somewhere that the TV has 16 MM: 1 contrast ratio.  The D8000 has 25MM : 1.  The sales guy from bestbuy said that Samsung dropped the contrast ratio specification this year because it is so high that they quoted the ratio as infinity.  This is another reason I picked the D7000 over the C - series.  I didn't buy the D8000 series because it costs $800 more than D7000 and I don't think I can notice the difference.  Another reason I bought this TV is that the D series is internet ready without a dongle while the C - series needs an external dongle.  The apps are fairly comprehensive.  You definitely need the QWERTY control to type things it.  I am still waiting for my QWERTY keyboard to show up.  I don't understand why Samsung did not include it in the TV packet.  It needs to be ordered separately (for free) via internet or phone with the registration code that comes with the TV.After 2 weeks of use, the HD picture quality is simply amazing - a million times better than my KDF-60X955 DLP TV.  The SD picture quality is many times better than my old TV.  I like this TV.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN55D7000 Review", "Author": "Andrew Plotkin", "ReviewID": "R18KKRJIHEO8ZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After several months of reading reviews and hanging out in various brick-and-mortar stores I finally settled on the Samsung UN55D7000.  Let me start off by saying the picture quality is fantastic, probably the best LED/LCD screen I've watched.  I personally prefer the brightness of an LCD over plasma, so my search was primarily focused on LCD style TV's.  The design of the TV is absolutely beautiful, and one of the reasons I went with the 7000 series over the 6000 series.Picture Quality (2D)As they other reviewers have said, there is defiantly clouding and edge bleeding (especially at the corners).  Is it apparent?  Yes - but only when the screen is almost completely black (for instance when you are turning the TV on). Is it distracting or does it take away from the image quality? Defiantly not - 99.9% of the time you won't even notice it.  The image quality is just flawless and there enough picture adjustments to make everyone happy.  Obviously not everyone is going to like the same picture settings so you'll have to play around until you find what you like.  Awesome black levels and the fast action motion is blur and artifact free.Picture Quality (3D)I've only played with the 3D feature at this point but from what I watched for a few minutes last night the 3D on this TV is just as good if not better than any plasma.  Images are crisp, clear, and bright and there is almost no cross-talk.  The 3D effects are absolutely stunning and it really makes the movie come to life.Design and ConnectivityAs I stated before, this TV looks gorgeous even when it's off.  The bezel is almost invisible and it makes the TV feel bigger.  There are plenty of connections on the TV for all of your A/V components.  The component and composite inputs are achieved via dedicated break-out cables and I personally appreciate the VGA PC input.  The TV is HDMI 1.4 compliant (and supports ARC through HDMI 2 only).  I highly recommend using HDMI 1.4 high speed cables (they can be found on Amazon for less than $10) to avoid any video issues.  The TV and my Yamaha receiver recognize each either through AnyNet+ (HDMI-CEC) but the control-ability is very limited (you must have AnyNet+ enabled to use ARC).  The TV also sports a dedicated LAN connection.  I personally am using WiFi and had no connection issues at all.  The WiFi can use either 2.4GHz or the 5GHz frequencies and supports Wireless N.SmartTV & AppsThe Apps and SmartTV are easy to setup (you must create an account with a Credit Card # the first time you login).  I haven't had a chance to play with many of them yet, but my take on the whole SmartTV system is that it's a \"nice to have\" but not something I'd use all the time (and certainly not a replacement for a computer by any means).QWERTY RemoteGreat idea but not a great implementation.  Pairing was a pain.  After trying about 10 times I found a forum online that said to stand about 1 ft away from the TV when pairing, which worked just fine.  The remote itself is a little awkward to handle.  When using it as a \"standard\" remote you must point it at the TV (it uses IR).  The shape is slightly awkward in that it isn't a rectangle but more of a trapezoid and sits in my hand awkwardly.  The backside is a QWERTY keyboard and connects via Bluetooth - it's a nice feature but not the easiest thing to type on (think typing on a smartphone)Summary of Pros:1. 2D Picture Quality: amazing deep blacks, crystal clear picture, no blurring or artifacts during fast motion scenes.2. 3D Picture Quality: limited cross-talk, bright, clear picture, smooth and no blurring3. Design: beautiful barely there bezel, super slim, and ultra light4. Other Features: 5GHz wireless N built-in, plenty of connectivity, supports HDMI 1.4, SmartTV/Apps are a nice additionSummary of (Minor) Cons:1. Clouding and Edge Light Bleeding - only apparent when the screen is extremely dark and does not affect picture quality during normal viewing.2. I never could get ARC (Audio Return Channel) to function just right.  It works, but not all the time.  I can't necessarily blame the TV, it could by my A/V receiver, but nevertheless I had to purchase an Optical Toslink cable to connect the TV and my receiver3. Pairing the included (yes, it's in the box) QWERTY remote was a pain.  The trick is to stand about 1 ft away from the TV when you are pairing it - when I did this I had no issues.4. Probably not a big deal these days but the hole pattern for mounting the TV on the wall is non-standard (i.e. not VESA compatible).  Most wall mounts will fit just about any hole pattern these days though.Even with its minor flaws, this is the best TV I have ever owned and I would highly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superbly Entertaining", "Author": "Mark R. Mazza \"MarkInEugene\"", "ReviewID": "R2OZH14B2HZE98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been an audio/videophile for 30 years.  This is my 9th HD set.  I purchased one of the first CRT HD RCA 39\" (275 back-breaking lbs.); paid 5k for a Mitsu projection (big box), and I have a 5k Sony SXRD 60\" in the living room. I could talk specs, but I'm not going to bother.  Picture  and sound quality has reached a plateau in electronics.  Sure, you can argue details, but follow me here if you can.  This Samsung in just a few words: provides an extremely pleasing entertainment experience.  The clarity is stunning, the brightness is immensely satisfying, and the eye-popping color is just beautiful.  The TV has a unique feel in a dark room sitting 4 feet from it.  The thin bezel makes the picture appear to float and the motion of the characters in scenes is smooth in a very distinct curious was.  I was very surprised at how, even a simple made for TV series like Legend of the Seeker, came alive with a vibrancy that I've never seen in a flat panel.  In a word this TV is stunning.The second point is the 2D to 3D conversion.  In my opinion it's fantastic.  No it doesn't look just like 3D, but it's a very admirable, clean feature that delivers exceptionally well.  In fact, I prefer watching 2D with the 3D converter on....it's just brings you into the story.  Remember everything any of us are saying is subjective and you can't know for sure that you're going to like something unless you try it yourself.The final point is 3D.  Now I see what this is all about.  3D implementation in today's home theater market is what I'd characterize as somewhat unnatural.  What I mean is, it's not like you're in the Grand Canyon while watching Freeman's River At Risk in 3D.  It's like you're looking at cutouts at various distances from where your sitting.  Don't get me wrong, running the rapids in the canyon was awesome and a very cool experience bringing you way closer to the real thing than standard 2D video.  The most important point about 3D that I've discovered is the effort made during the digital processing of the movie.  The Canyon DVD had a lot more ghosting in it and it was a strain at times to sort of focus because the technology tricks your eyes and strains them in a weird way.  But then, I put Clash of The Titans into the player and it had uncanny definition and barely noticeable ghosting.  In fact most of the time, I didn't notice it at all.  So from these 2 DVD's, I've concluded that the absolute best program material is required to produce exquisite 3D.  COT was an experience that I loved period.  So don't get into 3D on the cheap.  You need a good set like the 46D7000 and high quality program material.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very awesome television. Software is a bit lacking, however.", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R2OF5485QDIOAR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm going to try and break this review down in sections as best as possible. I purchased this TV about two weeks ago now from a local fry's electronics. I'm a big time technology geek, and I write software for mobile devices as my profession. Enough about me, and on to the TV!Screen [5/5]:Absolutely amazing. With the small bezel around the screen, it looks like you're hanging a moving photograph on the wall, not a traditional television. It's very slim, and is extremely aesthetically pleasing. Every bit of HD content looks extremely vibrant and life-like. There really is no comparison to samsung's screen quality. Truly brilliant.Speakers [4/5]:Very low profile, and are quite loud. I would still recommend using a home theatre system with it though. If you choose to use the standard speakers, you won't be too disappointed, but a nice surround sound system is definitely one of the best ways to compliment this amazing device, but there were times when I was using the built-in speakers and the playback on some movies was simply too low.Build Quality [5/5]:In a league of its own completely. Ultra-slim, very low profile, but still feels very sturdy. I didn't use the included stand, (which also felt very sturdy,) because I immediately hung the set on the wall. Everyone who comes over and looks at the TV is instantly wowed at how small the frame (bezel) of the set is, and how thin the actual set is, generally trying to compare it to their smart phones because they're just taken aback by how crazy thin the TV is.Connections [5/5]:Excellent support, the built in Wi-Fi is amazing, it has 4 HDMIs which will support nearly everything you could want to throw at it (I'm using a PS3 and a Logitech Revue with it, and even when I want to hook additional components... like my Xoom via micro-HDMI, I don't have to worry about unplugging anything else, or finding extra space). The added USB ports are also incredible. As soon as you want to check out anything you can just plug it in, and away you go. Interestingly, the USB connection seems to support codecs/playback that the uPnP/DLNA does not (more on that in the software section).Samsung Smart TV [2/5]:First let me say I applaud samsung for including extra applications and features that are starting to become standard for HDTVs. However, this entire area needs some serious clean-up, and in a hurry. If you're simply going to use netflix and pandora, you'll be just fine using this without many complaints. But across the TV, there were many things that just didn't seem fluid and were too difficult (even for someone who has quite a bit of experience with electronics) without having to put some serious thought into it. With normal television sets for instance, when you auto-program channels, you can simply go back and remove channels that don't come in well (or are in foreign languages that you may not want, etc.)... after auto-programming I realized that you cannot remove channels... but you can make a favorites list, and then set that favorites list as your default setup. Adding favorites was a pain, as you couldn't look at the entire list of channels and add them by simply checking/unchecking them... you had to go through to each channel individually then to the setup menu, then add to favorites, and then select the favorites list. I'm using an HD Antenna so I only received about 10-15 channels this way, but if you were to be using digital cable without a set-top box... this would take you the better part of 20-30 minutes, and it gets really repetitive and annoying pretty quickly. Next up, is the issue I have with DLNA streaming. For some reason, the USB ports and the DLNA streaming software seem to support different media codecs (which is bizarre to me). Example, I have a handful of my DVDs converted to AVI (Video: Xvid, Audio: MP3) and when I plug them into the USB port, playback works seamlessly and it works just as you would expect it to. When you try and play the exact same file from the built in DLNA player, you're greeted with a \"Format Not Supported\" message. I found this to be true of nearly every codec format I threw at the TV. I ended up getting frustrated and just using the Logitech Revue I had with TVersity to stream the content from my PC. I think this is just another example of how the software was supposed to be very expansive, but was left with some pretty large holes in different areas. In general, the menus and setup don't seem very well layed out, or very intuitive and without reading through the instruction manual... most people will get frustrated with this very quickly. It seems like samsung wanted to create their own in-house version of Google TV or Apple TV and just rushed it a bit too much. Out of everything, this is my only real complaint for this entire TV. If they could provide firmware updates, or allow GoogleTV to be installed in place of SmartTV, I would probably find this a lot more useful, but for the time being all of the \"Smart Features\" and TV apps, are going to come from my Logitech Revue. The Samsung menus and features are just too lacking.Other Thoughts:Not a huge fan of the included remote control. I know that sounds silly, the normal (front side) of the remote is actually very well laid out and straight forward to use. However the remote physically bulges to one side, so you can flip the remote over and use the qwerty keyboard for input on the tv. While this is handy if you want the additional input, it makes the remote physically awkward to hold and I'm sure will be a big turn off to most (my dad looked at the remote for about 30 seconds and said he wouldn't buy a similar TV if that was the remote he had to use), though universal remotes are an option... and in the end I just programmed a harmony remote for the TV and put this remote away in a drawer.I would recommend this TV to someone who is in the market. It's coming way down in price and it has a gorgeous display and the build quality currently cannot be matched. However, if you're not especially tech-savy, or you don't have the patience to sit down and learn all of the new menus and setup... this TV may not be for you. Most people aren't looking to have to sit down and go through an entire setup for their TV like it's a new computer. They expect to plug it in and see it work, or possibly click the \"Find Channels\" button and just have it go after that. It's going to be a very big change from the previous versions of TV they may be used to, but once you get accustomed to it... you'll fall in love with its amazing picture and build quality.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "LIke to Gamble? Well the odds are against you with this TV.", "Author": "AE", "ReviewID": "R347LB4UEK9P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all me start of by saying that I think samsung makes great products. I have numerous samsung products that have never failed me. My parents also have a 60 inch plasma Samsung TV they bough about 5 years ago with no problems till this day what so ever.Unfortunately Samsung really disappointed me on this one. Its such a shame because prior to my experience with this TV i held them to such a high regard.Amazon is such an amazing way to shop, they really are on the customers side that i am convinced of.When i got this TV, i was so excited. It is an absolutely stunning TV to look at, samsung really did a good job with the over all design of the tv. The LED panel on the tv is absolutely stunning so much that when you watch regular NON HI DEF channels the tv literally exposes all flaws in the picture quality, not a big deal for me as most of the channels i watch are in HI DEF ,but the few times i watch the local news station the image looks absolutely horrible. This is not Samsungs fault obviously and by no means should deter you from this tv, but your eyes get so used to seeing such crisp images that when you watch a non hd channel i can be a bit dramatic. Now Change over to Hi DEF channels or watch a blu ray and you will be blown away by the image quality, it truly is surreal.A lot of people complain about the settings. Considering you just paidt a lot of money for this tv, i see no reason one cannot take 10 minutes of their time to adjust the setting to their preference. There is no way they can adjust the setting out of the box to every ones liking.ON TO THE BAD:I went through two of these tvs. I dont know about you but when i pay this much for a TV, i expect as close to perfection as possible. I have simply come to the conclusion that as close to perfect as possible on this tv still leaves you far way.The first and most noticeable issue with this tv is the corner flash lighting. For those of you that do not know what that means let me explain. During dark scenes of any image on the screen that is dark around the edges of the screen you will  see an effect on the corners that appears as if there is a flash light inside you TV pointing towards the center of the screen. Its essentially light leaking out of the FOUR corners of the screen creating a spotlight or flash light effect. If you watch mostly TV shows this should not be as big of an issue or as noticeable as there are not as many black or dark scenes so you are not be  as aware the issue as brighter scenes mask the issue. If on the other hand you watch a lot of movies on a dvd or blu ray player that are in wide screen mode where you have the black horizontal space above and below the picture, then this issue becomes very annoying and distracting. Again when i pay this much for a tv i should not be experiencing such nonsense.Please note that this is no defect in the tv, its a by product of the way the tv lights the screen ( i will explain in a moment). Some will just do it less than the other so the degree of annoyance will vary. Now let me explain why the tv does this. The UN55D*7000* is \"EDGE LIT\" meaning that the TV panel is lit from the edges. The tv essentially blast light from the corners in oder for you to see what you are looking, so this is why you experience this Flash light effect at all four corners of the tv. The first Tv i received suffered from this but it was tolerable. One day i was playing my Xbox and out of no where a blue vertical line appeared running down the TV from top to to bottom about 3 inches to the right from the center just after 10 days of use. Naturally i tried everything to resolve the issue from reseting the tv, to trying different HDMI cables and so forth. Eventually i concluded the tv was just defective. I called amazon and within 5dyas i had a new tv and they took the old one.This time the issue was that the replacement had EXTREME flash lighting in the corners, beyond my tolerance level. In the top left corner it was so bad that it made colors in that area appear off. At the time amazon was out of stock so i was essentially upgraded to the UN55D*8000*.After getting the 8000 i was astonished at how much better the blacks where and the overall presentation of the images. It was not until i went digging around that i discovered the MAJOR difference between the 8000 and 7000 series. The 8000 series has INDEPENDENT pixel lighting. Meaning each pixel is lit independently as opposed to being EDGE LIT, so this has a dramatic effect on the blacks and whites. There are other diference like the 800 having a faster processor and so forth, but the difference listed above is the major one. I have no issues wit the 8000 related to picture quality. I did have issues with one of the HDMI ports. There are 4 and on was not working. Even though i only you use port as everything is connected to my A/V receiver, i felt it was something that be fixed. I called samsung and they promptly set me up for an appointment. They had to change the mother board as it what houses all the Ports and you cant just change on port. Everything has been fine every since.I could not bring my self to recommend that 7000 serious with out a BIG disclaimer, but i can surely recommend the 8000 series.Hope this helps.I gave them two stars for effort.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "The good and the bad", "Author": "awiggen", "ReviewID": "RW4B560W1TMF5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV on black friday and got a good price for it.

Over the past 10 years I have had the plasma's and LCD's and most recently a 47\" Sony LCD.If you are in the market for the top of the line LED, you really have to look no further.  I reviewed several TV's at the normal retail stores to look at quality of picture, profile, size, etc.  We were upgrading a Sony 47\" LCD, that continued to have a heat sink problem (2 years old and replaced under warranty 3 times).  I was looking for really anything outside the sony brand, which we have been seen a decline in quality in several Sony components over the past few years, the last of which was the aforementioned LCD TV.After several reviews and online research I decided on the Samsung UN55D7000.  I was initially going with the 8000 series, but really only one significant advantage was the pro dimmer, and after an in store evaluation, I really could not tell the difference - minus the 500 price difference that is.I ordered from Amazon (which I believe to be the best online retailer out there!) it was delivered 2 days earlier than expected.  Took a total of 5 minutes to get the stand put on, and set up in my family room.Couple of clarification points from other reviews:A couple of reviews mentioned that the QWERTY remote did not come with it - it does now, I think those must have been earlier shipments.Also many mention the pairing of the remote is difficult.  It took literally 2 seconds and I was 5 foot away from the TV.  Not sure where the issues are, but just get fairly close and you will not have a problem.I have watched many movies, tv shows, etc.  I have also not noticed any bleed through that others have mentioned from the LEDs that can happen.  I even watched some darker scenes with the black level at the highest setting 20 - and still have not noticed any light bleeding.Review:The picture is so noticeably better than both my Plasma in my Den and LCD that was in my family room - and when I say better, we are talking not even close.  I had the LCD still set up in my family room when I set up the Samsung LED - side by side and had Avatar running on both via my DVR. Both are full HD, etc.  The picture out of the box on the Samsung was more vivid, clearer, life like, vibrant, etc.  And remember I had my LCD for 2 years, so all the settings have been tweaked to my specific liking, while the Samsung was in it's preset mode.  It really is unbelievable.  By far the best picture on the market of any LCD's or LED's. And the best picture I have ever seen.  It looks so much better than in the retail stores as well with proper lighting...As you know it comes bundled with the first 3 Shrek 3d DVD's and 3D MegaMind (along with the Samsung 3d DVD Player).  The 3D quality is as good as any movie on the big screen I have seen.  It really was so much better than I had anticipated.  I didn't buy the TV for the 3D, more of a nice to have for my children...  They all agree that the experience is as good if not better than at the movie theater.  The glasses (comes with 2 pair) are quite expensive and a family of 5 will need to fork out a 250 extra for additional sets.The profile of the TV is ridiculous.  It is so thin and the bezel is almost not there.  Everyone that has seen it thinks it is more of a picture than a television.I have played around with the browser and applications a bit.  As others mentioned it is pretty cumbersome to navigate.  However, you will probably spend very little time in these apps outside netflix and an occasional YouTube video.  Once you set up your DirecTV or Cable to control the volume and on and off.  You will probably not use the remote that often either due to using the remote from your Sat or cable provider.Overall I really can't say anything negative about the overall TV.  It is by far the best picture and 3D experience you can have that is on the market today.- RWallace", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wowee TV", "Author": "Twig \"Twig\"", "ReviewID": "RA8RIYWN0PD4C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "BROWSER + 3DI returned the D6300 (which I loved), to get this one, because I really, really wanted both the 3D and the Web browser, even though ... WOW, expensive!(B.S. ALERT - You might notice on the TV comparison chart that the browser mysteriously \"disappears\" from the entry-level 3D TVs and doesn't reappear until THIS TV, $800 later, which strikes me as SLIMY of Samsung. But I won't even let this ruin my happy feeling, darn it.)OK, EXPENSIVE, but I used the Amazon Store Card to finance with no interest for 24 months, and if you divide the cost by 24 months, it's less than the price of cable. Let's NOT talk about how much the extended Squaretrade warranty was, theft / accident insurance from Worth Ave Group, Blu-Ray player, 3D glasses :: crying ::.)ANYWAY, I can't imagine NOT loving this TV.The browser is a little slow. It's buggy and even freezes when I watch multiple embedded videos full-screen (I watch a site that aggregates various videos from sc2 gaming). I even have had to turn off the TV on a couple of occasions to \"reboot.\" I wish I had one of those laser-pointed remotes I saw on the LG. But so what. It works, and the videos looks AMAZING in HD; better than I thought.APPSThe YouTube app REALLY need some work; for example, whenever I use the app (which is rare, as I use the browser, as stated), I'm forced to watch some idiot with hair gel hosting some weird \"Jackass\"-style show while I search. I HATE that, and haven't figured out how to turn this off. I suggest the Roku for anything other than YouTube (as the Roku doesn't have YouTube, thanks Google.) The QWERTY remote also doesn't work in the YouTube app; you have to navigate to each letter. Baffling. Some other features (left and right to switch between videos) are okay.Had a chance to try some of the other widgets and apps; the Facebook app is pretty low-fi (read: crappy) but it does get the job done.Twitter widget works well and is appealing. You can even tweet while watching TV, which is hilarious and pretty cool.Other widgets (weather, etc.) are graphically very nice.Anyway, as far as streaming live content goes, I'm using my new Roku ($100!) to watch Netfllix and FREE movies (not to mention UStream and Justin.TV), and that has really all the app functionality I need, except for YouTube, though this TV does have that, as I said.BROWSERBrowser is fine; crashes when I watch too many embedded videos, but so do some computers (more or less), so it doesn't worry me. I'm grateful for it, and I think having the extended warranty and insurance makes me not sweat it too much. They will probably update the firmware as time goes on, as well. But works like any browser, albeit with a bit of lag (though I am going WiFi only): has Favorites, History, etc. What's surprising is how AMAZINGLY CLEAR AND HI-RES video looks on this TV, just using the WiFi signal: I swear, better quality than my 1-year old iMac, going through Ethernet: no idea how this is even possible! I was expecting hitches and lo-res, so yes, totally amazed at the eye-poppingly colorful, crystal-clear HD quality when watching YouTube, in particular.REMOTEI LOVE the remote so far: it can control my Blu-Ray player (something the 6300 TV remote didn't have enough buttons for), and as I wrote (in my review of the BD-D6700 Blu-Ray player), that Blu-Ray player's remote isn't even LIT.But the QWERTY remote on this comes through; the remote is hefty, solid, and backlit, and does the job well.SOUNDVery nice! I'm an audiophile (musician) and I think it represents highs, mids, lower mids and bass quite well indeed. Balanced, thick, clean and loud. Don't think I'll buy a soundbar, though guess I could later on. Doesn't NEED one, though, and that's very important to me.SUMMARYSo YES, imperfections aside, cost aside, I LOVE this TV. It's has an AMAZING picture and EVERYTHING I need.DEAR SAMSUNG:I think you're being SHADY on leaving the browser off the cheaper 3D models.AND you should make that Blu-Ray player work a bit better.BUT your customer service is great, and I forgive you, because this is an AWESOME TV.But dudes ... seriously on the other stuff.--p.s. Just discovered if you roll your finger around on the arrows on the QWERTY side (not pressing), it senses and acts like a mouse trackpad, controlling the pointer. If this TV was a girl, I'd be proposing. (Follow-up note: Still wish there was a \"laser pointer\" option like the LG.)p.p.s. CLOUDING? Okay, I DID see symmetrical white areas on the screen when it was black -- something I didn't notice on the $800-cheaper 6300. Not visible when watching anything. Called Samsung (easy to reach), who told me it was due to heat / moisture during shipping and should resolve in 2 weeks, but to call them if it didn't resolve or got worse, and to keep TV ventilated (lol). Suggested I turn backlighting to 7 and go to Standard Picture Mode, and now you can't see it when black. Don't notice any less picture quality with backlighting lower.I'm usually INSANELY picky about things like this; but the Sony LED forums ALSO have the same complaint about this \"problem\"; but if I can't see it while I'm watching anything (so far), to me it isn't a problem, so I'm not going to worry. I have the 4-year warranty, so if it gets worse for some reason, I'll know what to do.

The first one I bought developed a dotted red line up and down the entire center of the screen two days after I bought it.  I also noticed right out of the box that it had an issue with judder (although I didn't know that term when I first saw it).I would describe it as a \"stuttering.\"  Not motion blur, that's different.  This stuttering is like a skip in the motion.  And for me, it isn't during fast motion, it is always during relatively slow motion, like someone turning their head.  It also shows up a lot while watching the ESPN \"ticker tape\" at the bottom of the screen.  Doing some research online, I found a YouTube link where someone says this motion stuttering is a problem for all C series, but was supposedly fixed in the D series.I replaced my first one with another 55D7000, and while I no longer have the dotted red line issue, I still have the stuttering problem.  I've searched reviews online and I can't find anyone else reporting this issue.  How is it possible I'm 0-for-2 and I'm the only one having this problem??Does anyone have any suggestions for me?

I used this TV to replace a 2 year old Samsung LCD 46\" 1080p that we're moving to the gameroom.First off, the picture is excellent.  Its like getting HD for the first time again.  The default settings were ok but much too bright in my opinion.  After dialing the backlight down and configuring the motion plus, this thing looks like I'm watching through a window.Great for gaming!  I've spent about 20 hrs or so online (Bad Co. 2 & COD Black ops) and have noticed zero lag from the TV.  Set it to gaming mode and tweak the black levels and you're good to go.  I couldn't be more impressed with the picture or speed.Now for the bad....I have 3 hardwired Xbox's and 2 wireless.  I also have 1 hardwired PC and 1 wireless.  I run 2 android phones and a network printer all through 1 router at my house.  My network has been stable for years now with no problems connecting, streaming, or downloading.  When I tried to run the network setup, the tv finds the network but cannot connect.  I run the setup again and it connects but will lose connection after about a 10 minute period.  It's been a nightmare trying to get this thing to stay connected.  I'm already considering ditching its wireless and dropping a Cat6 cable just for the tv.The Apps fall into the bad category as well.  For those of you who are wanting to ditch cable for internet tv, DON'T.  The apps are all free but you will have to register and pay for the content that you want to watch.  Also, the web browser is laughable.  When it decides to work, the cursor never stops jumping around on the page your viewing and it locks up 2 out of every 3 times I use it.  I looked for third party apps in hopes of finding a better browser but there are none out there.Other mentionables....The stand is super sturdy and looks great.Others reviewers complain about the HDMI inputs on the side being an issue but they are really not.  The tv includes a cable clip that you can mount onto the back and run the wires through first, hiding them in the process.  This is not an issue at all.The remote is great but difficult to use in the dark.  It has a light on it but it only stays on for a second, not long enough to be effective.  If you can't see the remote you're going to have to turn on a light to read it.My set did not come with 3d glasses so I'm waiting to get those at the moment.  Samsung just announced they will be shipping 2 pair with each set after May 1 and they are dropping the price for each pair to $50.00us on May 1st for those of us who did not get them included.  I'll order mine at that time.All in all, The tv does just what I bought it for.  I have computers and 360's for the internet so the bad wireless and apps are not a big issue for me.  It's great for gaming and will blow you away on Blu-Ray.  Even turned off the D7000 looks very impressive.

I'm using the Samsung picture frame hanging method and it truly does sit like a picture frame.  Watching HD content on cable and via Netflix is good but nothing to write home about.  I'm still on the fence about purchasing a Blue Ray player as I watch most content on-line nowadays.In my shopping, I was comparing the LG 65LW6500 inch and this TV.  It was size & passive 3D versus features & appearance.  I went for the Samsung and although I am not UN-happy, in hindsight I could have a larger TV because:1) The SMART TV functionality is still in my opinion not quite perfected yet.  Samsung has Apps but because of the slowness and limited number of apps, I found myself only using the basic ones commonly found on all \"SMART\" TV's.  Netflix, HULU, VUDU, YouTube, etc...nothing outside of the norm with the exception of SwipeIt and Pandora.2) Internet browser is slow and navigating with the included QWERTY remote is okay at best.  It can't play flash content and numerous web pages froze the TV or caused it to \"reboot\" back to the SMART TV home page.  The latest 2012 TV's displayed @ CES where much better with some including dual-core ability, although I did not test, the demos appeared to flow much smoother.3) Active 3D content - I never experienced the dizziness, hurting of eyes, or headaches people talk about when testing the glasses at stores but after watching an entire movie in active 3D, I could now relate.  I still don't experience any of the above but my eyes feel like they are \"exhausted\" after watching a 2+ hour movie.  I think passive will be the future path for 3D.So in hindsight, things that I thought I would use or thought were cool and nice-to-have turned out too be just bells and whistles that I feel I won't be using long term.  As I mentioned, I'm not un-happy with my purchase because as a TV, it works nicely and looks beautiful! Blacks are black enough for me, colors crisp and overall picture quality are great.  So if you are thinking of buying this TV because of any of the above, I would reconsider.  However, Samsung makes a great TV and I'm not returning it because overall, I'm satisfied with it!", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "All that I hoped it would be... and MORE!", "Author": "Darkhorse", "ReviewID": "R389JJV44LIE33", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi HD TV enthusiasts.After spending many hours reading other people's reviews, I thought it would only be fair to add my own, now that I am a proud owner of a 55\" D7000.  I couldn't be happier.  And boy... did I research and obsess over the options.  I felt conflicted because every time I went to the TV store, to my eye, the Samsung's out shined the competition every time.  And the slim bezel design is just so darn sexy.  But I kept reading all these negative reviews about the Samsung's and how they bleed light from the sides and corners of the screen.  I never saw this on the store displays, so I decided to take the plunge.  And I gotta say.... I love it.I have seen the light bleed that everyone talks about.  But here's the deal... it's a complete non-issue.  For me, it only shows up when it doesn't really matter, like during the rolling of credits after a movie, or during a black screen between commercials.  But when I am watching a movie, or HD cable TV, I have yet to see ANY light bleeding from the sides or corners.  Seriously.  I get beautiful blacks, and BRILLIANT colors, and stunning clarity.And for those who are wondering, \"Gee... what am I missing by not getting the D8000?\"  I have some encouragement for you, too.  I asked a salesman at my local TV store to put the 7000 right next to the 8000, and for a good half hour, I studied the two screens.  I had the same HD program material playing on both, and I made sure that both screens were set the same.  I'd like to think that I have a pretty discerning eye.  But to be completely honest, I could not tell the difference between the two.  I understand that the processors might be a little faster in the 8000, and that you get two pairs of 3D glasses with the 8000.  Oh... and the Samsung name glows at the bottom of the screen.  But from my vantage point, that sure doesn't justify the extra $400 for the higher model.  And I actually like the clear beveled edge of the 7000 better.  Again, I couldn't be happier.For audio, I use the ARC (Audio Return Channel) into my amplifier, and out to my stereo speakers.  It's great, because I have multiple sources via HDMI running into the D7000, but I only have to run 1 audio channel into my amplifier.  And it sounds fantastic.  And the audio appears to be perfectly synched.  If you're going to go big screen, go big sound, too!The Smart TV is fun.  My favorite apps are Vudu, YouTube and Pandora.  I hardly ever play CD's anymore, and I'm even giving my iTunes a rest.  I have had problems, however, creating new stations on Pandora from my D7000 remote.  It looks like it's working, but when I select the name of the artist for the new station, nothing happens.  I have resorted to creating new stations from my computer online, which then show up immediately on my TV, or doing it from my Samsung BD-D6500 Blu-ray player.  And speaking of the D6500, I have found that streaming Netflix through the Blu-ray player gives me clearer, better video than streaming it directly from the D7000.  The guy at the store told me that the Blu-ray player is better built to do that than the TV.  I also stream VuDu through my Blu-ray player into the D7000 and it looks AMAZING.The Auto Motion Plus is pretty unique feature.  But be prepared to be a little wigged out if you have it on \"Standard.\"  It's fine for watching football, and probably gives you a little smoother motion.  But for watching movies, it does something to your brain that's tough to describe.  It no longer feels like you're watching a movie.  It feels like you are right on the movie set.  Apparently, some people like this.  I do not.  For me, it takes the magic out of movie watching.  I no longer believe the story that I'm watching, because it feels like I'm just watching a bunch of actors on a set.  It's weird.  THANKFULLY, there is a setting called \"Clear\".  This maintains the amazing clarity of this TV, but somehow, it restores the magic of movie watching by reintroducing a mild dose of motion \"judder.\"  Apparently, this is what our brains are used to.There are four different screen modes: vivid, standard, natural and movie.  A number of reviewers recommend \"movie\", with a bunch of adjustments in other areas, like white balance, Red, Green, Blue, etc.  I tried all that, and was not impressed with the results.  To my eye, \"movie\" darkens the screen, and gives everything a brownish tint.  After awhile you get used to it.  But I like my colors to pop more than that.  My favorite setting is \"Natural\".  Standard and Vivid are just too bright, especially at night.  \"Natural\" is a nice compromise between \"movie\" and \"standard\".  The only downside for me is that with \"Natural\", you lose a little definition sometimes when there's a dark image on screen, and a newsperson in a dark suit.  But the trade off is worth it for me, with most programs and movies.I always hesitate to buy electronics soon before they are to release next year's model, because buyer's remorse is the worst.  But, I reasoned that there will always be next year's model, and this year's model is just so darn good.  In the next few months, the prices will probably drop on the D7000 as Samsung turns out it's 2012 models this winter, so it's a great time to buy 2011 models.  I took a sneak peak at CES on Samsung's website, and sure... there's some cool stuff coming out, but nothing that will dwarf what I just bought and make it feel like last year's piece of junk.

As for the controls, speakers etc, they are in the class you would expect for a high end TV of this caliber. Most people in this price range are going with their personal preference for a surround sound system anyways.  The picture is what you are paying the $$ for, the clarity & richness of the images really steal the show. They popped out at you even without the 3D element.

I agree with the other reviewer that it adds something to the technology of the 2D images even when not viewing in the 3D made.

Personally, I'd skip paying for Amazon right now and stay with Netflix. I'd think long and hard about buying Samsung again too. They both really pissed me off.

The extras like a qwerty remote, full web browsing with flash, Samsung and Yahoo apps galore, auto connectivity when connected devices or usb, plus all the settings a professional calibrator can dream up all makes this a very rich and satisfying purchase - Here is a list of things to look for and think about - will update after 2 weeks timePros -1. Color & Clarity & Settings2. Bezel is so thin looks like its floating (picture extends to edge, barely any frame)3. Loads of features - truly a smart TV (you can surf the true web while watching TV, bluray etc.)4. Easily setup, even building the stand was easy enough for one person to do -5. Sound goes either way depending on the setting, i like the movie mode and voice only which takes out the background noise6. Easy to use menu7. Apps! (love espn, yahoo weather, pandora and swipeit to name a few (you can swipe videos and photos from your phone to the TV!!!)Cons -1. Depending on what screen build (mine is the H303 which has the least problems supposidly) you can get some flashlighting/clouding in the corners (i have it but its very min. and only can be seen when the following occurs  1. The entire room is pitch black and you are watching a movie with the black bars top and bottom, (is this a deal breaker, well put it this way its very minimal and unless you pick it out youself you will never see it since you should be focusing on the movie)it doesn't interfere with the movie its only on the black portions of the bars - so again the ultra picky maybe will go nuts, but there are also workarounds -  2. During powerup the Samsung Smart TV logo comes on surrounded by black - you will see it here indefinitely but still not a problem  3. Certain apps during transition from menu to app have a black screen loading time you can see it here to, but again very min.**Changing the settings helps, putting the black settings into dark mode, lowering the backlighting to 7 and the possibility of having ambient light in the room all help to lower and almost do away with the corner flashlighting - and according to Samsung (no plausable fact that this works yet, if you leave the backlighting to 7 and change the mode for all viewing to movie mode for 2-3 weeks it will subside, something with LED breakin)2. Sound could be weak but certain settings help bring it out more, plus your cable volume should be in sync3. Older surround sound may not work - (analog connections)4. Only 1 Component and it comes with an adapter (2 pin type into TV) - Everything else is HDMISo in closing an excellent TV with all the bells and whistles you could want - a truley future proof TV -In 2 Weeks i will update with 3D (i got the package with a free Sam BD player and 2 pairs of glasses with this TV)**Update**Tried NBA 2k12 in 3D mode since its one of the few games out you can switch over to 3D with and its a interesting thing, yes you do get a headache halfway through the game but its cool to have the option and makes the game play have alot of depth!Also on the theme of game consoles i knew there was a game mode spec. for this TV which ups the HZ so everything is smoother - well after searching and realizing its not posted in the e-manual or online or google for that matter i finally found it! GAME MODE IS IN SYSTEM SETTINGS UNDER **GENERAL** its the first option you can select and only comes up when your gaming console is on and is recognized - why they hid that option who knows!As far as the flashlighting it seems to have went away, and with any room lighting on you will never see it - as for what Samsung says well i have the honor to speak with a high level tech who knew all about it and he said its not a defect in fact most leds have it to an extent and that you can lower the backlighting and keep black mode on darker and it should be fine, its not something you can turn off unfortunately and from time to time you may spot it but its so dim we are talking (1 out of 10 in terms of severity) that unless you are in a cave with no lights, and watching a movie that has no color in it you prob. dont need to worry about this - also he said **Movie Mode or Standard Mode is prob the best setting to avoid this but no need to leave a setting on for 2-3 weeks or do anything special because it won't help**If your model has it extreme where it interferes with your watching than maybe you do have a defect but i think those who complain are just unnaturally picky and i can understand spending the $$$ but in no way is a deal breaker for those looking at it for future reference -Gaming is incredible no need to really elaborate on it - amazing!The full web browser will need an update soon since it does have its freezing moments for like 2-3 mins you can type or move the cursor and than it will come back - has done this 2x so far - could be a connection issue who knows but i dont use it that much even though its a full functioning web browser while you watch TVThe Apps are cool but again just like a smartphone (which this TV acts like) they are cool in the beginning but rarely useful unless you wanna check scores, news or weather at a glance -Professional Calibration isnt needed on this TV - i give credit to those fanatics that love to calibrate but honestly i have tried to myself being savvy using a couple of different calibration methods and even trying those listed online - end result left my brand new set with colors washed out and the screen very dim - i know i will take slack for this but if you leave it on dynamic mode you will see the colors pop more than you will realize (movie mode and natural are nice but to my eye look dim and unnatural with colors) - i like a vivid picture and for some reason dynamic just works for me - others will vary!Hope this helps those on the fence, its really one of the top 5 TVs out to date**Update January 2013**The free Samsung 3D BD player given to me for purchasing the TV stopped working - the tray and internals basically went dead - upon calling Samsung, they tried to play a fast one on me saying my warranty was finished based on when the unit was sitting on the store shelf and not when bought by me, so i would have to pay $120 to fix, sorry Samsung will buy another BD player before that happens, plus the 3D at this point is getting OLD!Buyer beware on the all digital front panel BD players, i see nothing by poor quality from these especially since there are no physical buttons -TV still works great and I updated to the Samsung Sound Bar 2.1 (only grip is the lower end model with BT and wireless sub could be powered more - but the speakers themselves are very loud and i love the BT feature)", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok not great - Disappointed", "Author": "M.

Nothing. Now it is June 2011 and I think Samsung did a great job making quality TV, which cannot be beaten on this very crowded market for quite a while. For example, one time there was a problem of \"soap opera\" effect. This TV can be adjusted to introduce this effect, or completely remove it - no problem at all. The same about many other things.Talking about the Smart TV and Internet capabilities: It works. But don't expect more then that. If you are using applications, which are in a list of deployed by default, you will be ok, you might even like it, I do. But if you want to use a browser and get you to wherever you want, you can easily get in trouble.First of all the keyboard. It is nice, it has lights, it works ok with English, but there is no support for foreign characters at all. If you happen to be in need of entering anything besides English - you are screwed. Thanks to Softcorporations's free \"Vitrual Keyboard for Smart TV\" (which you can find on Internet using Google) I resolved this problem. I can enter foreign text to search video and movies and I can also enter English text much easier because this keyboard has predictive text capabilities, and it also works with regular remote control. This is nice, but this service can be used by any Smart TV, like Sony, LG, Toshiba, etc. i.e. here is no advantage of buying this particular, pretty expensive TV. And why did I pay for this beauty keyboard, if I'm not using it?Second is the speed of rendering the page in Samsung browser. It is slooooooowww!!! I wish to believe that Samsung one day will upgrade the TV software and all problems will be fixed, but so far my dream did not materialized :-(.Third is that not all content can be played in Samsung TV browser, i.e. it does not support all video formats.Etc, etc, etc... small staff, but disappointing.All in all, I'll give it score 4.

After the tv was warmed up the blackness on the right to the middle of the screeen minimized about 90% but the tv was still grainy and distorted in the area's where the blackness was.I am glad for the 1 year warranty..but like most of warranties getting service or replacement was and still is a nightmare. Communication breakdown was to blame with the service provider blaming it on their software system on their computers going down, maybe so..but when someone says they will call you back and let you know whats going on twice after a week apart and doesn't is rather aggravating. If you pay 2500$ for a TV and get crappy service or repair is unnecessary and unwarranted.I am in no way blaming Amazon for the Tv's breakdown, however I do blame Samsung and their hired contractor of choice who was not the original seller of the TV for their unprofessional communication and the break down there of.3 weeks and still watching half a normal picture TV..Parts on back order and not being told there of this unnaceptable...I am holding out for a new TV replacement and hope to restart my 1 year warranty on the new panel.

I just got the UN60d700 about a week and a half ago and as far as the tv goes, I am very happy.  Samsung support however is absolutely horrendous (I'll explain momentarily).For the tv, the picture quality is exceptional.  I simply don't see a better tv picture anywhere.  I have yet to find the perfect settings, but once I find them, I know it will knock my socks off (if anyone has found one to be really great, please share).  The sound is actually better than I expected.  Nothing great mind you so don't buy for the sound, but it's better than my last Samsung.  You will certainly need a good surround sound if you want to enjoy the real \"experience\", but for everyday tv watching, it is sufficient.  The internet while pretty cool at first, isn't quite there yet.  I'm not talking about streaming, that's fine.  But for actual browsing, it's pretty weak.  The qwerty keyboard doesn't work for a lot of the applications, so just typing in searches on youtube for example is pretty annoying.  For now, I'm sticking with my laptop for internet browsing.Now for Samsung support.  When I received the tv, I had a few problems.  First, when I connected my wireless, the tv easily connected after typing in my password.  But, every time I turned off my tv, it would lose total connection and have me search for a new wireless connection.  Samsung was worthless even at \"level 2 support\".  At first, they said I needed a new wireless adaptor and another rep said my router was too far.  My signal was very strong and all bars were good mind you, but he swore up and down it was too far saying there was no way it was anything else.  Long story short, I did some investigation on my own and in the end, Samsung has a bug and simply can't recognize the = sign in wireless passwords (probably some other characters too).  Once I removed them from my password, it worked perfectly.  I was considering reconfiguring my entire home wireless set-up for these guys.  Next, I noticed that when watching a tv show, the picture would start to get darker on its own.  I found this quite annoying (once you notice it, you can't stop noticing it).  I called Samsung and they said it shouldn't be happening and could be a problem.  Of course, they were going to send a technician and the whole 9 yards.  It turns out that the tv's have an eco feature where it lowers the picture brightness to adjust to the room to save energy.  Good idea I guess, but I really didn't like it. Very simply, you can turn this feature off in the menu and it's done.  I had to figure this out by myself (Samsung customer service don't know about this feature?).  A quick google search goes a long way, but I guess Samsung support technicians don't have access to the internet.In the end, I would absolutely still recommend the tv.  The quality is fantastic (I haven't played around with 3D yet) and even aesthetically, it's beautiful.  But be prepared that if you need any troubleshooting, you will probably have to manage it yourself.I hope this helps in your search.

The smart hub is a little archaic, although it is a cool feature, just don't think this TV will double as a PC, it's not nearly fast/powerful enough.  The \"flashlighting\" a couple of people are crying about is only noticible between commercials or when a movie is just about to start and the screen flashes black for less than a second, I reduced the backlight and its barely noticible now, if at all.  It does not occur at all while viewing actual content, ever.  The people that nitpick about some of this stuff are ridiculous.  I bought one of the slimline super cheap mounts on Amazon and ran the cables inside the wall, it's a really sweet looking set up.  I've just been nominated to have a Superbowl party by my friends because the picture looks so nice for sports.Summary: You'll love this TV (unless you are a techie, nerd who cares about the 1/4 second black screen flash corner flashlight right before a movie starts). I highly recommend this TV, it was a great deal for the 60\" at 2k, and it is a really sharp looking product, go for it!", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Crystal clear picture quality and great features", "Author": "Serkan Okar \"movie and music connoisseur\"", "ReviewID": "R9ZXLNXRS1F8W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV about on Nov 25, 2011 from a Sears store (sorry Amazon). For a long time, I was conflicted about buying it from Sears or Amazon; I had some concerns about ordering it online and then the hassle of having to return it if something went wrong or even the initial delivery and setup. I later have seen reviews which seem to indicate that my concerns were needless and Amazon provide great customer service (not to mention 24 months plan versus Sears' 18 months plan). If I had to make the choice again, I would have bought it from Amazon.As for TV, to me, it was a upgrade from JVC HD-61Z575 HD-ILA Micro-Display Technology TV which was excellent in terms of being a projection TV (the only picture related issue was that I could sometimes notice where the bulb was in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen but overall picture quality has been great for the past 7 years).The picture quality on this TV is simply amazing. I am noticing things in the movies I have viewed multiple times that I haven't noticed before. At first, it seemed that picture quality was almost unnaturally clear. This sounds weird because normally you would think that the clearer the picture, the better but not necessarily as it sometimes can be unnaturally clear (as if there is such a thing as too clear). This was mostly due to the fact that the picture was too bright. It felt as if the scene was lit up by unseen spotlights. Then I figured out the settings. Before you make any decision on any TV, one should try to adjust the settings. Since the technology has improved so drastically over the years, there are so many computerized settings on TV that can change the picture quality. My first change was to change the picture from \"natural\" to \"cinema mode\". And then I changed some settings regarding brightness, backlight and Auto-motionplus (you can find more details about those settings on the internet and even here on Amazon). Once you adjust the settings to your liking, this TV will perform greatly. UPDATE on Jan 12, 2012: I have recently started to notice some juddering effects while watching Blu-Ray movies. I tried to adjust the settings and tried almost everything (except for \"Clear\" and judder setting at \"0\" level). I found the best result was to turn off the auto-motion plus feature completely off. I am still not sure what this feature exactly provides and how is that I get juddering effect when it is on, which is a feature that is supposed to enhance the picture quality for fast-action scenes. The juddering effect does not even happen during fast action scenes, it happens randomly at any scene. I have a feeling it has something to do with the signal or feed from the bluray player (even maybe the cable) although I am not sure since I had the same bluray player, same cable and my old JVC HD TV didn't have any juddering effect whatsoever. Because of this, I changed the star rating from 5 to 4.I watched the 3D contents under \"Explore 3D\" button, a built-in module that allows the user to watch free 3D programs through internet streaming. I had difficulty watching \"Under Oceans\" but was able to watch the other programs. Some of them seemed to be slow in the beginning but worked at the end. I used Samsung 3D glasses model SSG-3050GB. I was impressed by the TV's 3D performance (not counting the freezes during streaming which is more likely due to the program or the source itself rather than the TV), but I wasn't impressed by the glasses. They are ok. But I think over time, I will get annoyed by the little strips that are attached to the lenses as I do notice them sometimes. I think more expensive 3D glasses models will probably perform better. UPDATE on Jan 12, 2012: I recently bought my first 3D movie just to test the TV (Monsters vs Aliens) and I loved the performance of my TV, the picture quality and 3D performance was fantastic.I never experienced the flashlight, clouding effect some reviewers mention here. It seems to be the biggest criticism. Honestly, I don't see any flashlights or clouding or whatever they call it. Maybe there are some defective units out there that have this issue. Or maybe I don't have the eyes to see it LOL :-) UPDATE on 12, 2012: When the room is dark, I do sometimes notice the light around the edges of the TV (its brighter around the edges more noticeable in darkness) but it's not a deal-breaker.Internet setup was easy and works fine although if you try to watch some internet video content through the web browser, performance is not that great and you may experience freezes (I think this is not because of the TV). I watched Netflix movies without any issues; they played smoothly without any dropping or freezing.I love the SmartHUB control panel where you can control every content on your TV from one single place.One of my concern is the missing SKYPE application. Samsung customer service agent told me that the reason why the SKYPE application wasn't on TV was because I didn't have webcam connected to the TV. I still have doubts about this. I don't understand how the app can come into being when you connect the webcam (unless it downloads/activates the app triggered by webcam). I have to provide more updates on this later. UPDATE on Jan 12, 2012: I was right afterall. SKYPE application is not dependent on camera being connected to TV. Somehow, it magically appeared in my list of applications under \"Lifestyle\" in SmartHub. I purchased Samsung CY-STC1100 and tested SKYPE. Everything went well but video quality is amazingly poor. I may return the camera and wait for a better model.The other concern was the TV stand - it was tilted slightly backwards. The manual says it has to be at perfect 90 degree angle. I disassembled it and assembled it back following the instructions but I couldn't succeed. It is still tilted slightly to the back. I found a solution for this placed miniature mounting pad under the back legs (I have a feeling there could be some kind of design flaw in the stands). UPDATE on Jan 12, 2012. This was totally my fault. There was nothing wrong with the TV stand or the way it was assembled. It was the main TV stand that was tilted.The only problem I had with the TV was the bluetooth adapter failure. All of a sudden, one night by QWERTY remote stopped working and wouldn't pair with the TV. Then I experienced the same thing with 3D glasses (both devices need to pair with TV through bluetooth to work). After talking with customer service, they sent repair service within 3 days. At first there was some confusion as to whether the tech had the correct part or not and I was told that my appointment was going to be postponed but then tech showed up for the original appointment and replaced the bluetooth adapter and now it's working fine.I paid $1,800 on 18 months plan from Sears on 11/25/2011.

It is not as bad as what they are writing, and your eyes easily adjust. Also if you view at too wide an angle the white contrast increases quickly.  This black/white contrast is the only minor thing I have noticed so far, and it's not that bad at all. Sports, movies and games stream excellently and the picture quality is top notch.

My previous TV was a 2 year old Samsung Plasma and this tv blows it away! absolutely no competition. the tv does have an issue and that is edge bleeding, it is especially noticeable in dark scenes or when a movie has the black bars in the top and bottom of the screen.Pros:1.) It has almost no bezel which makes it by far the best looking TV on the market, it almost looks like the picture is floating in the air.2.) Extremely thin and uses very little power.3.) The 3D is much much better than the 2010 models and beats almost any TV in 3D quality except the very best plasma displays, There is no color or brightness loss which was a problem with last years models, It looks much better than in the theaters.4.) Colors are breathtaking, after watching a movie on this tv it almost makes any other TV look like black and white.5.) Black levels are impressive, they are much better than even my 2 year old plasma, if it wasn't because of light bleeding i would say it is as good as the top end panasonic plasma's.Cons:1.) The only complaint would be light bleeding, you can't notice it if the area is well lit or if you are watching a movie that is naturally bright, but you will notice it if the room is dark and the movie is in a dark scene or has the black bars in the top and bottom of the screen, definitely the light bleeding is not as bad as the older LED models, but it is still something that needs improvement.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Picture Clarity but got a Defective one!", "Author": "Vasanth Kumar Padmanaban", "ReviewID": "R37IE72GHUQV2P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After a loooooooong search for TV's I finally zeroed it down to this model.

Overall we are very pleased.I'm a bit of a video snob and could easily see spending more to get a more uniform, professional picture ... but you know what?  It simply looks great.  When the screen goes black, yes, there is bleeding at the edges.  Who cares?  There are some shows that look a little unnatural, as if they are videotaped rather than filmed.  I'm sure this could be improved upon but I just haven't put the time into calibrating it any further (we did go through some basic steps with a calibration Blu-ray, but nothing super fancy).  It's my living room, and admission is free.  The picture pops in all sorts of lighting situations and the reflective glare is not bad at all.  The 3D features work well, and with the newer 3D glasses provide a very compelling experience.  I'm sure there is a bit more tweaking we could do to improve the image, but honestly just haven't gotten around to it.  Still, it's enough that nearly everyone who has visited with us for movies and whatnot has remarked on the overall impressive picture, and a couple of friends have even gone out to buy similar Samsung models (ours is the UN55D7000LFXZA).Physically, the unit is very thin compared to the competition in this price range, and the thin bezel completes its overall graceful design.  The Cylon base star swivel base in the box is just gravy.The remote is very unique, but unreliable (our Harmony universal remote, as with many other devices, does a much better job at getting the infrared signal to the TV than the TV's native remote does).  The keyboard is fairly tricky to use, and frankly many of the apps we have downloaded don't recognize its input (which, rather frustratingly, requires text be entered via arrow and select keys instead of the Qwerty keyboard).  There is an optical sensor in the middle of the mouse keys that should allow us to easily manipulate the mouse cursor on the screen, but this has been a frustrating experience as well, meaning we rarely actually \"surf\" anything that way.  Also, due to its pie-shaped side profile design, the remote is a bit unwieldy compared to those with a more ergonomic design.The sound is more than adequate, though we typically (as many probably do) listen to the sound via surround through our receiver.  The built in apps work well.  The set currently offers the newer version of the NetFlix app that lets you search for titles not already in your queue (very handy).  We have used other apps as well and there seem to be regular updates to the firmware and market.Some of the drawbacks, though minor, have included no ability to watch Amazon VOD (which, arguably, will probably become more of an issue as Netflix's \"per view\" pre-paid streaming contracts keep expiring) with apparently no plans to change this, and a somewhat cluttered 1.0 feel to the \"Smart TV\" interface (or whatever it's called) ... we even reconfigured this once to nest things in newly created folders--it was quite a chore, and in the end the whole interface kept locking up so we had to a hard reset to get it to work again.Toll-free technical support has been fairly lackluster, delivering a feeling that you are reaching the typical non-Samsung customer service center, outsourced from some phone farm somewhere (though it does seem domestically based) where the \"technicians\" know how to read their screens, but do not really have commanding knowledge of the product or its function, deliver a very \"scripty\" sort of experience, and are probably trained very little and not well paid to hone their craft.  The 3d glasses advertising \"Prescription Ready\" for these sets are a bit oversold--they are quite comfortable, and the effect works well, but they are not prescription ready ophthalmic frames in the sense that any optometrist can just slap optometric lenses ground to your prescription in--they must be taken to a specially-equipped optometrist that deals with the exclusive Hoya-branded product.  That frustrated me as it was a primary motivation for us to look at the 2011 line of Samsung LCD TVs.Overall, I feel I got a good value for this set and do not think it was a bad investment or a decision I should not have made.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Price was right", "Author": "Robert W.Shelton", "ReviewID": "R6R4U0TFFYMUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did extensive research comparing prices for my first LED HDTV and AMAZON beat all competitors.

Adjust the Judder reduction section of this feature to the #2 level (down from 5). This will prevent deletion of natural background blur while still allowing for a smooth motion appearance during on-screen fast action. This setting proved very good results in our HQV tests. We also highly recommend turning off the Digital Noise Reduction and MPEG Movie Filter features due to unwelcome shuttering effects.3D TV Glasses: The model is one of Samsung's newest (SSG-3300GR). Unlike some, these glasses are rechargeable using the included USB connection cables. The glasses are light and comfortable but as mentioned above do produce some glare off the sides of the lenses. Samsung includes 2 pair of 3D glasses in the box. Costs for extra sets will run you approximately $79.Features: 8.5/10Design: People either love or hate the UND7000 table top stand. For those that will be wall mounting, this is not an issue anyway. It could be called obnoxious, but I like that it's different and it swivels 20 degrees. It's functional, cool design. The super thin trim framing this TV is only .35\" in width all the way around the screen. It has a chrome silver finish on the edges. One thing I also like about the appearance is the jet black screen when the TV is off. This is Ultra Clear Panel which absorbs light and has a incredible depth.Menu Function and Remote Control: Samsung's new menu for the D7000 is quick and has a handy description of each function out beside the highlighted feature. As one would expect from this level of TV, you get a full 10 point white balance adjustment option and lots of extra features. The Smart LED feature is the option for Samsung's new micro-dimming technology. We noticed a very slight flicker occasionally when the micro dimming feature adjusts one part of the screen to enhance contrast. It's really not distracting, but picture purists will probably prefer it off. There are tons of optional picture settings in the Advanced and Picture Options settings. We've done the work for you on which of these to use. See our recommendations below in the picture section.One of the key differences of the UND7000 from the highest end UND8000 is the normal remote control that comes with the UND7000. It's backlit, functional, and has a special Smart Hub key for accessing Samsung's Smart Hub Internet TV features.Audio Output: Unlike most very slim LED-LCD TVs the D7000's 15 X 15 watt speakers performed solidly. Voice is well separated and clear and volume was sufficient to fill a large room. Overall sound is just well separated and there is also ample bass which is especially surprising considering the speaker housing size. The D7000 also has a Auto Volume leveler for to help reduce those annoying advertising volume increases.See the full review at 3D TV Buying Guide", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung D7000", "Author": "Billy J.

Seeing the TV in action at a local electronics store is what finally sealed the deal in making my decision. Hands down the D7000 by Samsung was what I had to have! The borders are near non-existent, the picture is flawless, up close and from side views. From digital cable to bluray to games on the Wii and XBox 360, I am still very impressed after about 3 days and 15-17 hours of viewing. I have not tried the 3D yet but will add to my review as soon as I do. The apps offer a heck of a lot, and the browser offers web surfing in a light and size that's out of this world. The remote paired well and came with my order, however I am using my Logitech Harmony remote mostly, except for surfing on the net with the awesome QWERTY pad on the samsung remote. Shipping was superb as well, I bought my TV from PaulsTV, the box arrived undamaged and on time.Pros: Easy to install, is very light. Picture outstanding, plays well with peripheral devices. Viewing area 99.5% of the TV screen, like a picture hung on the wall. More features and individualized preference settings than I am sure I even know about yet, and I didn't have a problem navigating the menus as well. Looks impressive and sharp even when it is off. No halos noticed around light text with a dark background, no peripheral light/backlight bleeding noticed either.Cons: I had to use some tips from a previous review on this TV (by CrazyShopper918 [Thank you!] on May 28, 2011), here on Amazon, to keep the picture from almost looking TOO real, like you were watching a play or viewing from the director's chair.

I just wanna say that this tv came with a free blu-ray 3-D player, two pair of glasses, and cost 1899.99 for it all. I'm sorry for posting this on amazon, considering I got it from Best Buy. Well first of all the Samsung logo only lights up on the 8000 version, from what I read because mine is dim.Gaming- I have played my Xbox 360 and PS3 on this thing and it has been mind blowing. I find myself looking at these games trying to notice stuff I may not have on my other '' smaller '' Samsung. The lag is something that people may want to address based on other peoples reviews. Some games are like that because of servers from these systems. I have no lag whatsoever on this AMAZING TV!!!!...the settings are different on every set once they leave the store, so I may be lucky there. The picture os so clear it's insane man. I think these things are before their time when it comes to clarity and definition. I HAVE HAD NO ISSUES WITH GAMING AT ALL. I wanna point out that I purchased brand new HDMI cables just for this thing. I am an Information Technology graduate, so power, precision, and cbaling means a lot to me.Clouding- NONE AT ALL!!! They say it comes in the corners most of the time, but I haven't seen any. Again these are the setting upon arrival. I have not edited anything on the color yet. I have to go and up the color a bit though. The setting looks a little low.Backlight Bleeding- ok this was something i did see. Changed the backlight to 2 and PRESTO!!, it was gone. There are no weird things when the screen shows levels of black. Honestly people, play with these setting here. There are so many that it can take some time to get the picture to where you want it to be and satisfy your taste on whatever mode you're on.Blu-Ray & picture- Holy sh@%!!!...unbelieveable man!!!...that's all I can say!!! The picture when watching television is amazing even for standard definition. The HD channels are just stunning man, simply stunning. I have AT&T; UVERSE cable, and the HD was top notch!3-D & Glasses- the glasses are a bit cheap looking and feeling (they were free and that says it all) but the players is touch screen and wifi. Speaking of wifi, the tv picked up my signal and started to connect right away. Amazingly it updates the firmware or software or whatever. I haven't downloaded any apps or anything like that so i'm not sure how that goes. The 3-d jumps of the screen at you man. The freaking player doesn't come with a 3-d HDMI cable so that's an extra purchase. Remeber though, the cables mean a lot on things of this caliber.Sound- The sound was great, in my opinion. My room is small to the tv is enormous, and the sound is good. There is limited room for speakers when you see how slim this damn thing is. Samsung is insane for making this tv looks so freaking good.If i have missed anything I am so sorry. This is a major purchase and I understand that people want to be sure of what they are getting. I was cautious at first, but said screw it and bought it. I'm watching the final four even as I type this review. Check it, the lights above the court can be seen on the court as a reflection.

I went through a little bit of hoopla with Samsung and literally went through 3 TV's since September, ending up with the 46\" 7000 Series today, December 26th, 2011.*******************************************************************************************************************************September Review on 40\" 6000 Series: I bought this Samsung LED TV and I'm not COMPLETELY happy with my purchase.  First of all, I used to have a 55\" LCD 850 Series which was purchased back in 2009.  That TV also had the same issue as this TV.To start, I called Samsung to complain about a clouding effect which is the main reason for my 3 Star Review.  My definition of clouding is the white effect in a totally black screen when watching movies, viewing your laptop, etc.  I had light coming through all four corners of the screen, and also some white (appearing as clouds) throughout the middle of the screen.  I would have thought after two years when the 55\" 850 Series was purchased that this issue would have finally been corrected; Apparently not!When I called Samsung, they began trouble shooting the TV.  After the trouble shooting failed, they immediately scheduled an authorized Samsung dealer to contact me in regards to the issue, and have it serviced immediately.  A new panel was ordered (which happened to take over a week) and then installed.  Honestly, clouding seems to be worse compared to the original panel.  So as you can imagine, I am not at ALL happy about this.  And just for reference, the back-light is set to 13 and the contrast is set to 95, which is what the Authorized Dealer suggested.  Well guess what...I can still see the clouds.My other complaint on the TV is the remote.  IMHO, the center/enter button which is surrounded by the up/down left/right arrows (navigation buttons) should be raised.  At night, I don't want to look at my remote to make sure I'm pressing the center/enter button.  This is somewhat of a nuisance and think this button could have been engineered much better.Additionally, digital streaming of movies through Amazon Prime is not compatible.  So your Prime Membership will not work with this TV if you are looking to stream movies from Amazon.Apps are slow to load most of the time.  No way to download apps that I want, including Amazon Prime and Yahoo.Other than that, I will update this review as needed since I purchased the TV September 1st, and today is October 7th, 2011.*******************************************************************************************************************************December 8th, 2011 UPDATE:  Due to my ongoing problems with \"clouds\" after a Samsung Authorized Service Center replaced my LCD Panel (clouds were worse), Samsung's Executive Service Department contacted me and so far I have been pleased with the communications.  They offered to send me out a replacement TV and due to my inconvenience, they are upgrading my model to the 6300.  The only difference is that this TV will have a web browser where the 6000 does not.  I probably could have gotten a 3D TV had I asked, but wasn't interested in the technology at this time being that it is so new.  Not to mention, extended 3D viewing can't be real good for your eyes.  I will keep everyone updated once I receive my replacement TV.  One thing is certain -- Samsung does stand behind their product and goes the extra mile to make things right.*******************************************************************************************************************************December 19th, 2011 UPDATE:  Received new TV today.  However, it is the 6000 Series and not the 6300 as they promised and documented.  Made a call to Samsung and they were apologetic.  They are shipping out ANOTHER TV along with a $50 Best Buy Gift Card.  Hopefully, it's the right model this time and hopefully the card will have money on it.  ;o)  If not, maybe I'll just call again and push for a 55\" big screen.  AYE YAI YAI...*******************************************************************************************************************************December 20th, 2011 UPDATE:  I received a phone call from a different representative today, and she requested that I take a picture of the tag on the back of the TV that shows the Model # and Serial #, although I recited this information to a previous supervisor/manager yesterday.  She said they would not be sending out the replacement TV until this information was provided.  As you could imagine, I about went into orbit.  So, I demanded to speak with another manager in the Executive Relations Department.  After a long hold, the manager finally got on the phone.  She asked what she could do, and I told her \"Let's just forget about it.  Pick up your TV and refund my money.  I don't need to be inconvenienced any further and take offense to this ridiculous request, as though I'm being dishonest.  Further, I supplied the information from the back of the TV to another manager/supervisor and she confirmed that this was the TV that was sent to me, and that it is absolutely positively the 6000 model.  Let's just call it a day and I'll buy from a different manufacturer.\"At this point, I don't think she liked the thought of losing me as a customer.  So she extended this offer:  With her sincere apology and everything I have gone through, she will now move me into the 7000 Series, and she was even willing to give me a bigger screen size.  I told her that it wouldn't be necessary and I'll stick with the 40\".  For my inconvenience, she is sending me a 7000 Series with the $50 Best Buy Gift Card as was previously promised to me.  Although I didn't want a 3D model, I appreciated the gesture and accepted.  Now let's see if I get the right model this time!*******************************************************************************************************************************December 26th, 2011 UPDATE: Well, what a belated Merry Christmas to me. Today I received the Samsung 7000 Series TV, in a 46\". So far, the TV and remote are AWESOME! I am very happy. And finally, NO CLOUDS!!! There is some light coming in from the four corners and this I can live with. No more white light clouding effect in the middle or other parts of the screen!!!  The manager/supervisor called me today and we chatted. I informed her that I was just on my way back from Best Buy as I had to purchase a new Full-Motion Wall Mount, as my previous mount would not work for the 46\". She stated that they had no more 40\" / 7000 Series in the warehouse (I didn't think they even existed, but didn't argue) and that I was actually supposed to receive it on Wednesday. She was happy to hear that I received it so quickly and also advised me that my Best Buy Gift card would be increased to $100 and that should cover the majority of the 3D glasses. She stated if I have any further problems, that she will go ahead and put me in the 7900 Series if needed. I was very appreciative, so we'll see how everything goes from this point on. Because of this, I have upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars and Samsung has once again earned my business. I will continue reviewing this TV as I become more familiar with it and post more in the coming weeks.

We don't notice any clouding while watching a TV Show or Movie (only  during source switching where the screen goes to near black for a moment).  - less, but still some flash-lighting in the corners (in the area during a  movie, where there is a black bar at the top and bottom of screen).  We  don't notice this that much (i.e. it's not distracting).  - During the last few days - we notice some lighter black levels on each  vertical side of the screen.  This is noticed more when we sit closer to  the TV (e.g. 6 feet away at an off angle) HDMI compatibility issues with my older PS3 (which is completely compatible with my 3 year old Samsung LCD).  It seems to work fine with a new PS3 slim.We are convinced that 60\" is not too big (everyone likes the size forthe room)....  however when we sometimes sit fairly close to the TV....we can see some of the off angle issues of LED/LCDs (maybe because theTV is so big).  We do not notice this nearly as much on our 3 year old TV.Overall we all believe our 3 year old 46\" Samsung LN46a650 LCD hasbetter picture quality than this TV....  which for the money means this TVdoesn't seem like a sufficient value.... we are not experts though.In a fairly bright room, this might be the best choice given all trade-offs,but in a room with controlled lighting, we want better picture qualityfor the money.Update on January 4th, 2012:  Now that we have had a month with theour 1st plasma (Panasonic TC-P55GT30), I am lowering my rating of theUNxxD7000 from 3 stars down to 2.  Given trade-offs, we had been loyal buyersof LCD technology....  However, the picture quality of the 55GT30 isconsistently very good...  very satisfying....  much better than the UNxxD7000....and comparing at the 55\" size, the 55GT30 costs ~ $600 less.No TV is perfect.... but the 55GT30 is very satisfying for the $$s paid.(BTW - the 55GT30 picture quality at our home comes off much betterthan it appears in retail establishments).", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great deal, great TV--anyone know the Universal Remote code?", "Author": "J&K", "ReviewID": "RRXYXJ7M0WF9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Review is below. in the meantime, if anyone has found a Universal Remote Control code that works the volume on this TV correctly, can you please reply with the code that you are using?  I have the RF blaster kit from URC that includes the R20 remote.  Thanks.After studying these for awhile it came down the the Samsung D8000 59\" plasma vs. the D7000 55\" LED (we didn't consider the D8000 LED because of the silver bezel--wife stronly preferred clear, which is only on the D7000, and I couldn't discern any difference in image quality).  Didn't consider the new Sony XBR 929 because it was $1000 more and as you all know, buying the TV itself is only the beginning--have to factor in blue-ray, 3D glasses, universal remote, some 3D movies, expensive cables, mounting bracket, etc.  We chose the D7000 LED over the D8000 plasma for the following reasons: 1) my wife preferred the aesthetics, and since I had her convinced we should put on the wall, I didn't want to press my luck; 2)we're using in a very bright room of windows, so I felt there would be less washout of the LED; and 3) the plasma is several inches bigger, and might have been a little too big for our wall.Picture:  Out of the box we turned on the ML All-star game and it was amazing, but we tried the calibration of \"movie\" picture mode as provided by another reviewer (thank you!) and it was better.  This darkens and cools the picture a bit, but it's more relaxing to watch.  The kids sometimes prefer to change to \"natural\" picture mode with the factory pre-sets, but I think it's a plus that the TV has multiple modes and saves your calibration settings for each. We'll probaby toggle between natural / standard / movie depending on the source and content we are watching, which is a great option. I have never seen any of the backlight issues others complain of.The picture is definitely better for some sources than others.  Watching Fios HD channels is jaw-droppingly amazing.  Watching blu-rays is incredible (we got the inexpensive Samsung blu-ray player sold in a bundle with the 3d starter kit).  However, when we watched the DVD (not Blu-Ray) of Yogi Bear movie last night on the Blu-Ray player, the picture wasn't great.  Colors seemed very purple, but most of all there was this effect of a delay in focusing on the subject in each change of camera angle.  Cut to yogi--he looks blurry for about 1/2 second--then he comes into focus.  Same for other characters.  I don't know if it's caused by crappy production of this movie, a problem playing the DVD on the blu-ray, a problem with the quality of the blu-ray, or what.  I doubt it's the TV because the other sources (as described above) are outstanding, including shrek and james bond blu-rays.  So I'm not dinging the TV for this, but you should know that if you use a setup like mine some sources will be better than others.We have tried Shrek in 3D blu-ray and a broadcast baseball game on ESPN, in which we used the TV's 2D->3D conversion.  The 3D blu-ray is killer. The conversion of broadcast TV was neat, but a little less impressive and after awhile I started to wonder if it was worth the cost of sitting there looking like Ray Charles.Mounting: My AV store told me to steer clear of the Samsung \"picture wire\" mount because you can't adjust it once you put it on the wall--gravity takes over, so if you decide it needs to be 1/2 inch left/right/higher/lower, you're drilling new holes in your wall.  Instead they steered me to a Sanus 0.55\" low profile mount that is much more sturdy and adjustable, and CHEAPER than the Samsung picture wire.  Very happy and highly recommend that setup.  Just recognize that when mounting low-profile on your wall, ANYTHING on the wall behind the TV will push it forward.  This included the cover plate of the electrical outlet on ours (you should use recessed outlet) and the HDMI cables (AV installer was able to nestle them in the depression in back of TV so this effect is minimal, but consider this when picking HDMI cables.Value:  I'm really happy.  I got this TV for under 2k and don't think there was a better quality picture in that price range.  The aesthetics and design make my wife really happy, so we're pleased. Just wish I could find a 3 digit Universal Remote Control code that makes all features on the TV work on the R20 remote.

It gets 5 stars mainly due to my extreme enthusiasm and happiness at this TV, imperfections aside.________BROWSER + 3DI returned the D6300 (which I loved), to get this one, because I really, really wanted both the 3D and the Web browser, even though ... WOW, expensive!(B.S. ALERT - You might notice on the TV comparison chart that the browser mysteriously \"disappears\" from the entry-level 3D TVs and doesn't reappear until THIS TV, $800 later, which strikes me as SLIMY of Samsung. But I won't even let this ruin my happy feeling, darn it.)OK, EXPENSIVE, but I used the Amazon Store Card to finance with no interest for 24 months, and if you divide the cost by 24 months, it's less than the price of cable. Let's NOT talk about how much the extended Squaretrade warranty was, theft / accident insurance from Worth Ave Group, Blu-Ray player, 3D glasses :: crying ::.)ANYWAY, I can't imagine NOT loving this TV.The browser is a little slow. It's buggy and even freezes when I watch multiple embedded videos full-screen (I watch a site that aggregates various videos from sc2 gaming). I even have had to turn off the TV on a couple of occasions to \"reboot.\" I wish I had one of those laser-pointed remotes I saw on the LG. But so what. It works, and the videos looks AMAZING in HD; better than I thought.APPSThe YouTube app REALLY need some work; for example, whenever I use the app (which is rare, as I use the browser, as stated), I'm forced to watch some idiot with hair gel hosting some weird \"Jackass\"-style show while I search. I HATE that, and haven't figured out how to turn this off. I suggest the Roku for anything other than YouTube (as the Roku doesn't have YouTube, thanks Google.) The QWERTY remote also doesn't work in the YouTube app; you have to navigate to each letter. Baffling. Some other features (left and right to switch between videos) are okay.Had a chance to try some of the other widgets and apps; the Facebook app is pretty low-fi (read: crappy) but it does get the job done.Twitter widget works well and is appealing. You can even tweet while watching TV, which is hilarious and pretty cool.Other widgets (weather, etc.) are graphically very nice.Anyway, as far as streaming live content goes, I'm using my new Roku ($100!) to watch Netfllix and FREE movies (not to mention UStream and Justin.TV), and that has really all the app functionality I need, except for YouTube, though this TV does have that, as I said.BROWSERBrowser is fine; crashes when I watch too many embedded videos, but so do some computers (more or less), so it doesn't worry me. I'm grateful for it, and I think having the extended warranty and insurance makes me not sweat it too much. They will probably update the firmware as time goes on, as well. But works like any browser, albeit with a bit of lag (though I am going WiFi only): has Favorites, History, etc. What's surprising is how AMAZINGLY CLEAR AND HI-RES video looks on this TV, just using the WiFi signal: I swear, better quality than my 1-year old iMac, going through Ethernet: no idea how this is even possible! I was expecting hitches and lo-res, so yes, totally amazed at the eye-poppingly colorful, crystal-clear HD quality when watching YouTube, in particular.REMOTEI LOVE the remote so far: it can control my Blu-Ray player (something the 6300 TV remote didn't have enough buttons for), and as I wrote (in my review of the BD-D6700 Blu-Ray player), that Blu-Ray player's remote isn't even LIT.But the QWERTY remote on this comes through; the remote is hefty, solid, and backlit, and does the job well.SOUNDVery nice! I'm an audiophile (musician) and I think it represents highs, mids, lower mids and bass quite well indeed. Balanced, thick, clean and loud. Don't think I'll buy a soundbar, though guess I could later on. Doesn't NEED one, though, and that's very important to me.SUMMARYSo YES, imperfections aside, cost aside, I LOVE this TV. It's has an AMAZING picture and EVERYTHING I need.DEAR SAMSUNG:I think you're being SHADY on leaving the browser off the cheaper 3D models.AND you should make that Blu-Ray player work a bit better.BUT your customer service is great, and I forgive you, because this is an AWESOME TV.But dudes ... seriously on the other stuff.--p.s. Just discovered if you roll your finger around on the arrows on the QWERTY side (not pressing), it senses and acts like a mouse trackpad, controlling the pointer. If this TV was a girl, I'd be proposing. (Follow-up note: Still wish there was a \"laser pointer\" option like the LG.)p.p.s. CLOUDING? Okay, I DID see symmetrical white areas on the screen when it was black -- something I didn't notice on the $800-cheaper 6300. Not visible when watching anything. Called Samsung (easy to reach), who told me it was due to heat / moisture during shipping and should resolve in 2 weeks, but to call them if it didn't resolve or got worse, and to keep TV ventilated (lol). Suggested I turn backlighting to 7 and go to Standard Picture Mode, and now you can't see it when black. Don't notice any less picture quality with backlighting lower.I'm usually INSANELY picky about things like this; but the Sony LED forums ALSO have the same complaint about this \"problem\"; but if I can't see it while I'm watching anything (so far), to me it isn't a problem, so I'm not going to worry. I have the 4-year warranty, so if it gets worse for some reason, I'll know what to do.

I must confess, I didn't buy it for its Smart TV features or for its 3-D capability, but rather due to the excellent reviews of its performance as a TV.  And the picture has been nothing short of a-mazing!  I had it mounted on a wall above a fireplace, at a time when there were other workmen in the condo, and everyone--including me--commented on how sharp and beautiful the picture looked.  To the naked eye, the images look like 2-D Plus to me, with obvious depth and distinction between the close-up and further away objects.  I have a Samsung TV, 40 inch, from two years ago, and I cannot get over how much improved the picture is from that already terrific picture.  Color saturation, deep blacks, you name it--it has it all, plus that incredibly small bezel that gives the illusion of an infinity picture.  I will note that placing the TV in a bright room enhances the silver bezel and infinity image, without detracting form the picture brightness or quality.I should emphasize that I was looking for the best possible picture for an attractive price, I didn't care about 3-D or the latest Web-centric applications, as I have plenty of other ways of accessing the Web.  The price for this TV has come down dramatically now that the 2012 models are out, and so I thought it a bargain.I am happy with more or less the factory settings.

When I watch movies and I have only watched one National Treasure I set the TV picture to movie, this tones it down to almost theater quality, if you don't the white of the snow was too bright. I can't comment on sound as I have it running on surround sound. I do not have a 3d sound system, I am using an older pioneer system run with digital optical and its great. I am running an Xbox 360 and gaming is incredible no lag, I do set the TV to game mode, I was playing NHL last night and noticed for the first time reflections off the glass and ice its AWESOME and no lag to speak of! From a how does it look in the living room, its a beautiful set, the chrome legs really make it fit in to our style. The only downside is it sits very low on the stand, my LG sits about 4 inches higher and I liked that a lot, that being said I will probably mount this on the wall very soon and that will no longer be an issue. Whats great about this TV is when you turn off the lights and watch a movie the screen looks like its just floating in the living room, that zero edge is amazing. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was the deal a got with amazon did not include two pair of glasses, so I would like to rate it 4.89 but could not. I did ask the CEVA guys about their experience with returns dealing with amazon and he said they are great and will make things right if they need to be. So to set people at ease if you can get it from amazon(amazon fulfillment)you should be protected and feel safe laying down this amount of cash.AbstractGreat TVwould recommendpicture is great (need to research settings find what you like, internet is full of settings just search)my bleeding was very minimalshipping was great with CEVAwould rate this 4.89 if I couldnot 5 stars only because it did not include 2 pair of glassessmart tv is great, my wifi is fast and movies are great, setup took 2 minutes", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "AMAZING! Don't Look Any Further!", "Author": "Sandra Sternberg", "ReviewID": "R3A62M57QDZ7MW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV after researching online, and comparing in person at stores. My two contenders were this Samsung and the Sony Bravia. After seeing them in the store together there was no doubt that Samsung has better picture quality, although I changed the settings to \"natural\" because it was a bit exaggerated. The Smart Hub on the Samsung is so much better than Sony's selection of widgets. You get the web browser which is easy to use with the QWERTY remote (located on backside of regular TV remote so no need for multiples), Facebook, SKYPE, Twitter, Hulu Plus, Netflix, CNET, CinemaNow, Yahoo!, Swipe It (lets you swipe photos and videos from your phone right to the TV) and access to many Samsung Apps. There's also an app for Android and iPhones to use as a remote for the TV, which for the Android app, also controls my Samsung BluRay player!The design of the TV is beautiful with an almost edgeless bevel, and sleek silver legs. Picture is fantastic, but there is some reflectiveness from side angles in daylight. Setup was simple, I'm not sure why some reviews say it was difficult to setup wireless connection... as soon as you turn on the TV and pair the remote, the setup menu comes up and walks you through everything. Immediately, it found signals and I just scrolled down to my router to select, then entered the WEP key.The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the 3D is not as great as I expected. I didn't have a 3D movie to put in, just a sample that was stored on the TV. I've read rave reviews about the 3D on this model so maybe a movie is made with better technology and will make the difference. Overall, this is a GREAT BUY!

Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R7OVZDS9N3ZRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've only had this television on the wall since yesterday, but we are absolutely blown away by the picture quality.  I chose this model after seeing it in a department store - it was the one TV my eyes kept coming back to...it looks incredible from every angle, and I love the light, borderless, clean design.  It looks great even when turned off.  We don't plan to buy 3D glasses or use 3D programming, but honestly everything looks 3D without it!  I've actually felt nauseous watching a couple of programs because they are so lifelike.  As some other reviewers have noted, it feels like you're watching a play or sitting on set with actors instead of watching them on a screen.  My only complaint is that the light on the remote control is useless - it only stays on for about 2 seconds.  Not a Samsung issue:  I'm annoyed that my cable provider, TimeWarner, doesn't allow for HBO GO yet...it's one of the apps built into this TV, and I really want to use it!  They recently got on board with HBO GO for iPad, so hopefully they will be compatible with Samsung apps soon.  If you purchase this or any other 3D compatible television, I highly recommend the Cheetah Mounts High Speed HDMI cables (I bought 4 of them for this TV):  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GGTTZ0/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "D.

Then refresh rates, dimming characteristics, etc.  Ughhhh.Was replacing a 42\" Pioneer plasma, wanted something bigger (55\").  Wanted a 240hz refresh rate (lots of ESPN in my house).  Could really care less about the 3D technology.  TV speakers weren't an issue as I run all my components through a Pioneer Elite AV receiver.After lots of research, went to the local BBuy and watched TV for a while.  In fact, asked a sales clerk if they would match price and 'depends' was the answer.  Apparently, per BBuy, 'Paul's TV' wasn't a 'reputable' vendor (even though order was fullfilled by Amazon), so no luck.  Didn't expect them to price match, but thought it worth trying.  Even if they did, also had to contend with state sales tax (another $100) if I bought it locally.  Enough about BBuy.TV was delivered on time.  Had the guys unpack it, turn it on.  Mounted the TV yesterday and the picture is absolutely amazing.  Of course, looked for the dreaded 'white spots' everyone chirps about, but everything looked fine to me.  I haven't calibrated the TV, everything at factory settings for now (oh yeah, BBuy wants $200 for this too).Extremely pleased with the TV.  Haven't even tried the 3D yet.  Hooked the TV up to CAT5, and the apps all seem pretty cool, but again, not a selling point for me.  Encourage you to read all the reviews, do the research, but for me........this TV seemed to be the best bang for the buck after killing many a brain cell learning way too much about this stuff.

All TV's in the coming years will adapt Samsung's approach, it just makes the TV disappear and the picture become king! The sound is acceptable and even has SRS surround effect that makes the sound even bigger. It's not enough for true movie watching though. I added a ZVOX 420 and an additional 8\" powered subwoofer out of the audio outputs of the TV and the sound is much closer to a surround experience.After extreme daily testing for all of it's features. \"AND YES\" LED finally surpasses plasma with Samsung's new dimming technology. I am 90% satisfied with my purchase. The D8000 models actually have even better black levels because they actually turn completely off when there is no color info, as where the 7000 models dim. I think this is why people complain about the light bleeding effect. It can be overcome/compensated for by following the user settings people have posted to calibrate the set for experiencing the best movie watching.I am a visual effects artist and animation designer working in the TV / Film post production industry since 1990. So I am very familiar with high standards in visual representation benchmarks. I can honestly say the 3D of this set is mind blowing. We have had close friends over to watch films and they couldn't stop gasping and commenting on the quality this set displays. We even enjoy the 2D - 3D conversion process, our entire Standard definition DVD collection now has a new life of possibility. The up-conversion of our player makes all our movies crisper, brighter, more dimensional and very close to Bluray quality. I don't know how they do it, but it works. True cinephiles and 3D snobs may thumb their nose at conversion tv's to which they may have some points, but to the other 99% of the world, myself included can easily be impressed. I recently viewed the new 2011 remaster of Ridley Scott's \"LEGEND\" with the 3D conversion turned on. I have seen this movie nearly 50 times since it was first released. I owned the VHS, Laserdisc, DVD versions and I know this film like the back of my hand. And after seeing the Bluray converted into 3D I was astounded at the dimensionality and detail that came through, It was as if I had never seen it before. I felt like a teenager again watching it for the first time.The points about the remote navigation and having to type using a arrow cursor, even though this remote has a qwerty keyboard (doesn't apply to most apps including Netflix) is nearly appalling. Netflix and Samsung servers as of 2-2012 are having some kind of massive conflicts and constantly crashes the TV. I went to Best Buy and heard several managers telling me that there are problems with Netflix and Samsung. Searching for content is a pain using the arrow cursor, it nearly ruins the whole purpose of having a smart TV. The only place to use the qwerty is with the web app and it is very slow, so I only use it when necessary. It's obvious this is still early technology for smart TV trying to cram so many all-in-one solutions into one set. I see it all transforming becoming more web based and much more user friendly and faster within the next year or so. I saw from CES 2012 the new Samsung tech and it looks like all these issues with GUI have been changed to hand gestures and a camera on the sets. In the meantime I bought a Raku XS for another $100 to surf netflix, and use other apps and quite honestly it blows Samsung's App Hub away.Perhaps Samsung would do better to just offer a great display drop all the extra crap and make the cost lower and let buyers find other means of streaming content that are better at it. Obviously Samsung wants to be everything to everyone, they have taken on a big bite to handle an emerging market. Buy this set when it goes on sale when the new 2012 models come out, if you want a good deal and are willing to do some leapfrogging in a year or two to the next updated model. It seems that the TV industry is timing their sales and releases closely with the Superbowl this year with 3D being all the rage.I bought this set because with an add on shelf I can make if fit just to the edge of my IKEA Expedit Entertainment center. It is about 1/2\" too big to actually fit inside the recess, the 8000 model will probably squeeze in because it has an even thinner profile. SO I am going to get it in a month or so when the price drops closer to $1,200.Definitely get the SSG-3100 3D glasses they are more comfortable, and have a wrap around design which are more advanced than the free packaged ones that came with my set. Also keep an eye out for the new ZVOX sound models coming out this year they have an improved bass response and a better signal output for a subwoofer. If you want a slim system 3D with an amazing picture with 2D-3D conversion you can't beat this set or the UN46D8000. The App hub has limitations along with some novel qualities. It's not the reason to buy the set, think of them more as icing that sometimes you need to trim when your cake is too sweet.

Since the remote has a QWERTY keyboard I thought it was going to be very large, however the form factor and size of the remote is very decent. The 240hz motion is a requirement, my friend has a 120hz recently purchased TV and I could immediately tell the difference.PROS: thin profile, smart applications, DLNA, QWERTY remote, 240hz motionCONS: QWERTY remote usability is not integrated into all applications (example QWERTY doesn't work with Youtube app). Thin profile (yes this is a negative as well): all manufacturers that make thin profile TVs should consider separate component units so that you only have to run 1 wire (power + data) to the TV. The thin profile of the TV makes it very difficult to access and modify cables once its wall mounted. The USB ports are definitely inaccessible once the TV is mounted (recommending plugging in a USB extender cable ahead of time)**I got an ultra-thin wall mount and since there's barely 1inch clearance behind the TV you HAVE to dismount the TV in order to modify cable connections, unless you have a retractable wall mount I don't think its possible to make any cable modifications without dismounting the TV.

The remote is a damn waste of time.First of all, everything about Smart TV is a joke. It's incredibly sluggish. People would say that's just the lack of power of TVs, but I disagree. Embedded systems are definitely powerful to run home theatres, and if you look at something like Popcorn Hour, Boxee, etc. all of those do better aswell. There is a lot to be desired here. But in the end, the Smart TV is a gimmick, you will end up having to buy a HTPC or a separate media system. This one is too slow and just doesn't cope.More about Smart TV: for most applications you cannot even use the IR keyboard to input text, you will need to use the navigation cursor. It's clumsy, subpar, and just horrible for a first iteration. I forsee Samsung not properly improving on the interface in the future either; this is how most vendors operate.

I think its me, I had this 2002 model 19\" Sony Flat screen that weighed a ton, so I guess I'm not used to seeing football on an HDTV)- I wish the 60\" model was available when I bought it, I'm a typical guy and want the biggest and baddest TV out there. I have the 55\", and for the time being, I know I own the biggest and baddest TV out there.ConclusionI spent almost a year looking at TVs, almost went with a Sony during their PS3+HDTV event in January - so glad I didn't. LG has some great TVs, but I just couldn't get it to the correct setting while messing with some TVs at Best Buy - it always seemed something was missing compared to the Samsungs.I almost bought the Samsung C7000, but for $400 more, I got this baby and the 3D voucher and my PS3 (the ps3 was due to an awesome Slick Deals... deal).I couldn't be any happier with this TV. My fiance comes over a lot more to watch her favorite TV shows, my work productivity has gone down, but its great to spend a night watching the tube with my favorite gal.Enjoy!", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great but incompatible TV", "Author": "Ravi", "ReviewID": "R2KN7XLU4YY98W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung UN55D7000 is a great TV for HD content with vibrant and life like colors.

I remember las years model 3D was pretty crappy so I was considering a Sony but the overall appearance of this tv is just to great.  3D games, movies, and the few available channels are all fantastic.  I know some peoples eyes are bothered by 3D so that is always something to consider.  The remote is pretty intense but also pretty neat overall I like it.  Sound isnt bad for how thin the tv is but with the sound bar and sub I have great sound anyways.  Hopefully this will help some people make decisions.The only issue I had was payment with the Amazon store card.

What I can say is that after less that 6 months of use, light started to radiate from the corners of the screen and it's getting progressively worst.

The best listed price we could find was around $1,300. Amazon warehouse was $924, so we paid the $924 plus a $45 squaretrade one-year full warranty.When we got the TV, it was in its original wrapping in the box. The TV was in brand new condition, even though Amazon warehouse has standard language that states that there are a few cosmetic blemishes on the TVs. The only indication that it was used was the re-tape job on the outside of the box. When we opened it, we realized that a part was missing that connects the TV to the stand. I called Amazon customer service, who said I needed to call the manufacturer since it was an open box item, but that they would give me a $138 refund for my troubles, and still refund the full amount if I wanted to return it. We ended up wall mounting the TV for a few extra $ (which we were thinking of doing anyhow), and paying a net price of around $785 (not including the warranty or wall mount kit) for a new 3D Smart TV. I wish all customer service was as good as Amazon. It's the reason I'm a Prime member.As far as the actual TV goes, it is amazing. We have watched one 3D movie that we rented from Verizon Fios On Demand, and the picture quality was spectacular. The TV is easy to set up, and easy to learn. The 2D picture is also amazing.I'm not sure why everyone that posted other reviews hates the web browser so much. It is definitely not as good as having a mouse or touch screen, but I think a lot of people just don't understand that you can use the center button on the Qwerty side of the remote as a touchpad to move and click the cursor - it's very smooth and easy considering it's a TV remote. It's like using a big Android phone.I will definitely be shopping at Amazon Warehouse for future purchases, well worth the discount as far as this experience goes.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid 3D HDTV", "Author": "Mac", "ReviewID": "R3RR05W95QP2WJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My search for a new modern age tv began about 2 months before xmas. I went to several different stores and did timely extensive research all over including online, reading as many reviews and spec details as I could for all the potential sets I was interested in in the hopes of landing a perfect TV at a good value and price.  I wanted a new bedroom TV and my budget was $500-$1100. After a couple weeks searching I saw a good sale on the Samsung LN40D550 LCD TV ($450) in a Sears store so I bought it. Tried it out and it was ok, but didn't quite have enough bells and whistles as far as extra features that I was interested in so i returned it within a week. Not too long after on black friday I saw and purchased the Samsung UN40D6000 model LED (on sale for $700) with the separate wifi link stick and thought I'd found my tv.  After trying it out I determined that the tv had a decent picture but the viewing angle was poor and the design was mediocre in my opinion. A couple weeks into December I saw the samsung UN40D6420 at bestbuy on sale and decided to return the UN40D6000 and upgrade to the 6420 to try 3d out. But then after buying it I found out the 6420 was not full 1080 capable 3D and although the 2D pic was ok, the overall TV felt a bit generic and pricey at the $999 i paid for it. Basically I just didn't feel I was getting my money's worth so a couple of days later when I saw Amazon having a big sale on the Samsung UN46D7000 for $1160, I returned the 6420 super quick and ordered the 46D7000 model online.The D7000 was a model I had been eyeing since the beginning of my tv search, in fact ever since I walked into a Sears store in Octpber and saw it on the wall I said to myself  (about the 55\") ... \"that's my dream tv!\"  But the 7000 series was high priced at that time, over my budget so i didnt even consider it, until the big amazon xmas sale arrived on it unexpectedly.Quick research confirmed to me that the 46\" was the same exact tv as the 55\" D7000 that awed me in the store, the screen size was the single only difference.I was then overjoyed when I bought it right before xmas. After amazon shipped the TV(only took 3 days free) I'll admit I was a little nervous opening the box and turning it on, fearing the possibilty of getting a defective \"flashlight tv\" that I'd been reading about as a big issue with this model and that a lot of reviewers/owners were talking about.  I got the H301 panel (november build) Set the TV up in minutes on the stand and I turned it on, and I did see a slight white in the 4 corners, but it was no where near as bad as some reviewers made it sound or showed pics of with their D7000s. Mine was tolerable. I will say this though, the viewing angle of the tv looked better in the store, no matter what picture setting i put it on at home the view faded out with a slight whitewash tint when viewing at even small angles. Its not horribly bad though, I don't want to exaggerate, its just noticeable.The design and looks(bezel, shape, and thinness) of this tv are perfect, this tv is hands down the best looking set I saw at all the stores and online as far as its design goes. The slim bezel looks super and the tv is ultra thin from the side. The claw stand looks nicer than i thought close up although I wish this tv could swivel more than 10 degrees on it.The features of the TV are quite good. Plenty of inputs for all kinds of media connections. I like the online Smart hub features built in to the TV. The web browser works fine although a bit clunky, youtube good but clunky to search and navigate. Streaming is perfectly fine though youtube and netflix though and the web browser plays flash from all the sites i tried very well. I'm using wireless wifi for the net with this tv and i can't complain much about the results, very good. So I guess the only minor negative complaint about the smart hub would be controlling the interface (surfing and searching) The qwerty remote functions fine the smart hub is just slow.As for movie and TV viewing, I tried every calibration setting posted on the net even from customer and professional reviewers but honestly could never find myself fully satisfied with any of the settings they posted when I applied them to my TV. Maybe each TV has to have its own settings found to look its best, I have a few I calibrated that look real good just not perfect. Also, I constantly feel the need to switch picture modes throughout the day according to the lighting or show I'm watching. A little unfortunate that I can't seem to find a perfect all around calibration setting (yet) but i'll keep experimenting and looking for one. For the most part though the picture is very clear on the tv under most calibration settings offered but the motion appears kind of fake and jitterish no matter what one I use. I also found that most calibration settings posted on the net are either too bright or too dim, no fine in between settings found yet. In general cartoony shows look real good on this TV, better than regular non animated shows, just thought I'd add that for whatever its worth. Overall regular SD viewing is decent (like an 8/10) but not excellent and HD viewing is mostly great (9/10)... So good picture quality is there but again the main problem I think with this TV picture overall is the motion, just a bit too much movement blur no matter the setting or at least all the ones I tried. Motion just isn't as smooth as it should be for a lot of shows, but not horrible. I suppose you could put the tv in game mode to cancel the blur and it'll accomplish that for the most part but I noticed it will also sacrifice picture clarity and color vibrance considerably by doing so.I tried about 5 3D blu rays out on this set so far. The 3D on this TV is good but does feel a little gimmicky at this stage in the 3D technology. You can tell that in a couple more years down the road the technology and TV models will likely be much better in that area.I am a gamer, so here's the deal with the lag (reports and rumors of it) after trying out some xbox 360 and PS3 games on it in case anyone wants another opinion on that. The lag is not bad on this TV, and in game mode the lag is very very small. Will not effect or disturb gaming to a great degree.  I suppose I would say gaming on this TV is very good but not perfect. Call it fun and satisfying and good enough for most people who aren't ridiculously super picky perfection seekers. I'll add that gaming lag on the bestbuy d6420 model I took back was much much worst than on this D7000.After my research I believe the D7000 and D8000 are the best LED sets on the market up to now, despite the few issues I talked about. I viewed all of the LCD/LED sets of 2011 from all different brands in the store and this D7000, (or the almost identical D8000) wins overall imo. I would just recommend anyone who wants this D7000 set to get it on sale, in other words don't pay more than $1200 and you should feel ok with the purchase as far as getting your money's worth (providing the tv you get is not defective) $1100-1200 is about all I feel this TV is worth(the 46\" model)I'm still on the 30 day period to return this TV but am leaning toward keeping it much more than returning it. There are literally no other LED's or LCD's that I'm interested in getting over this and I looked into/researched all of them. There is potentially only one TV I'm considering trading this TV in for , a plasma Samsung PN51D7000 voted TV of the year by CNET, but I'm liking my D7000 LED TV more each day I turn it on so its doubtful i'll make the switch. If i do make the exchange I'll update this review.

Setup was a breeze.  The picture was perfect right out of the box.  No backlight bleeding like other reviewers have said, no adjustments were necessary at all.  Picture is fantastic.  HD is incredible. Internet is slow, but I don't use my TV to surf the net.  Hooked it up to a Sony playstation 3 for 3D and dvd playing.  Have not tried 3D yet, so no comment there. My setup works perfectly:  Cable from wall into Monster power strip, cable from power strip to cable/DVR box in, High Speed HDMI cable from Cable/DVR box out to TV in, Playstation High Speed HDMI cable out into TV, Digital optical cable from TV to Stereo receiver.  The digital optical cable from the TV also works for the playstation without changing the cord, ie... you get 5.1 surround sound from the playstation when playing dvd's thru the TV into the receiver.  My receiver is about 8 years old so it does not have HDMI inputs like new ones do.  Make sure you buy HIGH SPEED HDMI cables if you want the best picture and you need them for 3D anyways.  Buy the 10 foot ones on Amazon for $10.  The 6 foot ones are too short if you need to move your tv to get to the back of it. Got this TV on Amazon for $1,699, the 7000 model.  My wife and daughter both said I should have got the 60\" after seeing it.  These TV's are all screen so you can fit a bigger Tv than you think.  It replaced a 50\", so I am still happy, and the 60\" is about 50% more. The TV takes 6-7 seconds to turn on, not a big deal to me, but another reviewer complained about it.

Horrifically slow, sluggish, bad design, bad layout. What were they thinking?? If you ever used Roku interface, you will absolutely hate Samsung Smart Center.3. As previous reviewers notices, there is slight clouding when screen goes completely black. You can darken your screen and get rid some of it, but you will lose dark shades as well. Overall I got used to it, and since rarely we look at completely dark screen, it does not bother me so much.4. Picture enhancements - artificial sharpening, de-blurring, dynamic this and that - it all makes your Bluray looks terrible, especially in animated movies with clearly defined lines. Disable all the enhancements (turned on by factory default) and try watching again. This one alone made me miss my old CRT/tube TV until I turned all these pointless features off. The image regained it's more natural, organic feel. There is such thing as too sharp, especially when you get artifacts along borderlines. After all if you are playing Bluray disc, it's already perfectly sharp, it's digital, you need no further sharpening. For other less-perfect sources that could use some sharpening, there is no quick way to enable it all without going through the main menu.5. Dear Samsung, please make your interface and icons simple, 2d, eye-pleasing. Even Microsoft gets it for crying out aloud! We do not want or need 3D, animated icons. This is not Fisher Price toy. Simple is good. Less is more.6. So I mute my TV in order to play sound from Bluray player on my receiver, BAM... big ugly 3d speaker icon will bounce up and down your TV screen. WT Heck!? You can either lower your sound all the way down, or play TV sound in addition to your big speakers. I know I can go through menu and disable sound (ext speaker option) or patch HDMI into receiver, but that requires Menu marathon. I listen through TV speakers for all programming except Movies. I want easy way to mute TV sound without 3d-speaker icon bouncing all over my screen.7. Smart Apps - sounds great, right in your TV, no? Wrong, they are slow to start, terribly performing, sluggish. Try Youtube once and you will hate it. Netflix app is slow, unstable, far cry from say $60 Roku player or similar.8. Connectors on the back and hard to reach. This is not necessarily bad for this particular model but all flat screens. I wish there was a solution short of buying expensive swing-out mounts.GOOD STUFF:1. Picture quality is great once you disable \"enhancements\"2. It's very light TV and I can mount and unmount it without breaking a sweat.3. It's a great external monitor for your laptop.

As a result I ended up spending more money on a better model than I would otherwise considered. I got mine at Best Buy, and it came bundled with a blu ray player and 3D glasses.The picture is great, bright with vibrant colors. The 240Hz anti blur works, but I keep it off since I don't watch sports.Having 4 HDMI inputs in addition to the component input makes this TV very flexible for hooking up other devices- I have cables to play my camcorder directly through the TV, a micro HDMI to do the same with my smart phone, and a USB cable that connects to our digital camera. Our Wii uses the component inputs.3D was NOT something I really wanted on a TV, but came to appreciate it for the occasional 3D nature shows we want to watch. It's used very little, but does work well- this system uses active (powered by battery) 3 D glasses rather than the the passive type.The only real complaint I have with this unit is trying to browse the Web. The remote has a full ASCII keyboard on the back side, but the key are tiny buttons and hard to use. The web browser interface is even more frustrating - slow and unintuitive. The TV has wireless, but I noticed a big improvement in speed when I connected it to our wireless router with a cat 5 cable.  The sound  from the 10 watt speakers is OK, but you'll want a real sound system when watching anything other than news- no one builds a TV that can put out sound that properlythe compliments the kind of picture an HDTV puts out anyway.Overall I'm quite satisfied after 15 months .

Two days ago it went out. Samsung's customer service has been horrible. Had a TV repair man come out and tell us that the power board is bad and that it's pretty typical with these TV's. Advised we check for class action lawsuits, since Samsung doesn't seem to stand behind their products.When we got this TV we were very much in love with it. Sang Samsung's praises to all we knew. Even bought another Samsung TV (51\" D8000) a year later. Both TV's were professionally installed. Our newest TV began acting up shortly after we got it. Powers off on its own and the audio freezes and repeats, like a skipping record. Called Samsung immediately after those things started happening and would never get the issue escalated. Would keep telling me to reset and do updates as if I didn't do those things in the first place. It became so maddening I stopped calling and have just been living with the annoyance. Because I know I'm still under warranty.Now that our D7000 has gone out and its not even two years old and our D8000 that isn't even a year old is a lemon, I am recommending that buyers go with another brand. I'm going to have to take time out to go to war with Samsung. They will have to fix my TV that is still under warranty and I will have to force them to stand behind their product so that my D7000 gets fixed at what should be no cost to me. I love the TV, its the company that I have a problem with. If they won't stand behind their product I will never buy from them again. I have $5,000 worth of TV's that don't work!

Minton", "ReviewID": "R3FSK4PBVV9UK3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a SONY 40 Inch (CRT tube) XBR Wega TV and the picture was just phenomenal. Unfortunately it died about a month ago so I replaced it with the Samsung UN55D7000My review of this TV is from 3 areas - TV, Remote, and Software (Internet/Smart Hub/AllShare).The TV...I have both my DVR cable box (Motorola DCH3416) and Sony Blu-Ray connected via HDMI cables, and once the TV is adjusted, the picture quality and colors are impressive. HD and Blu-Ray content really comes to life on this 55 inch TV.  Give the Blu-Ray version of Avatar a go and you'll be blown away by the size, color and richness of the set. Sporting events in HD look just as good, and once adjusted, the motion blur practically disappears, thanks to the 720 Clear Motion Rate.Connect a cable independent of the cable box to the built in Digital Tuner and you get clear sharp digital channels (ex 3.1) that look just as good as some HD channels; quite impressive.This also allows for the PIP (Picture-in-Picture) feature where you can view any channel the tuner has tuned in independent of the cable box. So you might watch Fox sports on the main screen and have say CBS sports on the PIP screen.The One negative of PIP here is you can't easily switch between sources to \"listen\" to the other picture. The only way to do this with PIP is to switch inputs from one source to the next - Ex: HDMI to T.V. or vice versa. With my old Sony not only could you do this with the flip of a toggle switch, but you could also resize the screen. To resize the Samsung you'll have to go into System, PIP settings.As for audio, you'll want to adjust the sound via the equalizer under sound settings as it can sound a bit tinny due to the small speakers. For movies where I want that punch I have the TV connected to my Rotel DSP amp via optical cable and get the full spectrum of sound, e.g. 5.1 audio.The (included) QWERTY remote... from both sides (TV/QWERTY):First, both sides have some similarities such as navigation (Arrow) and quick (4 color coded A-D) buttons.The TV side includes the Power, Source, and other standard buttons like Volume, Channel, and Num. pad. It also includes media player controls - record, play, Stop, etc. Additionally there's an On/Off backlight button that backlights the remote when a button is pressed. Unfortunately there is no backlighting on the QWERTY side. None!The QWERTY (internet) side: Well the QWERTY side looks like a miniature keyboard with letter and number keys, a small LCD screen at the top center (no backlighting), the quick buttons to the left, and the navigation buttons to the lower right. In the middle of the navigation buttons you have an input button that also serves as a finger sensor (QWERTY side only). Pressing the C button while on the internet turns on the mouse pointer that you can move around using your finger.Speaking of the Internet... it is excruciatingly slow.  I have high speed cable (Cox) and have the TV on my wireless network and its just plain slow. Add to that the unintuitive QWERTY remote, clunky navigation, and it makes for a totally un-enjoyable internet experience.Another internet issue is that it appears certain content won't play, or is so slow as to appear to be disabled. Go to giants.com for example and attempt to play any of the video content and it won't play.Speaking of content (which gets into the third area)... Software (AllShare/Smart Hub)The good, you can stream music, videos, and pictures from your computer to your TV. You can stream your MP3 iTunes library.The bad... it doesn't support aac files! If you've encoded your music files in aac format, AllShare, the TV's streaming/sharing software, won't recognize them, and will tell you it's an unsupported file format.Also, while in Smart Hub, I've found that you have to point the remote directly at the TV sensor or you'll get erratic behavior; that sometimes your input won't register, or you'll get a delayed reaction.Regarding the whole Smart side of the TV, I was told by a sales rep that Smart Hub and all its features are better and faster with the newer TV's since they're getting faster better processors. Maybe...BTW I need to mention that as soon as you turn on the TV and get the network setup all software on the TV is automatically updated so you'll have the latest updates out.I can't comment on the 3D side as I have no interest at this time. And the set doesn't include 3D glasses.Anyway I might have been a little upset had I bought this TV for the smart side, but I didn't, I bought it for its picture quality. In that end, the TV is phenomenal. Overall I'll give 4 stars, but it goes like this...TV side - 5 (picture quality, styling)Remote - 4 (at least it's a QWERTY remote)Software (Smart Hub/Internet) - 3.5 (slow internet, erratic, finicky)This really is a great TV.

I am really happy with the image quality.The bad:1.  Depending on where your set was manufactured, you won't be able to watch Amazon Prime instant streaming movies2.  There is no way to determine the internet connection speed.  Thus, it isn't possible to ascertain if you have sufficient bandwidth to stream 3D movies.  (aside from watching them stutter when there isn't sufficient bandwidth)3.  Digital audio comes into the set via the HDMI cable.  This is good news.  You can then output that digital audio stream back to your amplifier enabling you to run a single set of wires from the TV to the Amp regardless of source.  Unfortunately, the TV downgrades to digital 2.1 rather than retaining the higher resolution signal.

You can easily adjust things to your viewing environment.  I have yet to see any clouding, ghosting, edge bleed, or any other picture issues.-Easy setup between components.-The menus are easy to use, no problems at all with SmartHub, apps download quickly.-Words are tough to describe how incredible the picture is.  It looks like it's live!  I have mine hooked up to a PS3 for Bluray.  Personally I recommend Avatar Bluray, just WOW.-Streaming works great.  I am using a Linksys e4200, and powerline setup.  No glitches or buffering issues with movies or music.CONS:(minor)-I wish it came with a paper manual along with in the TV, makes it easier when going through menus and such.  I just used my laptop, but maybe not everyone has that available.-No Amazon VOD, hopefully they will get the licensing.-Speakers aren't that great, but I have mine hooked to a surround system.Overall A great purchase especially with the price drops for new units.

The colors are vivid, glare is minimal if mounted and angled properly.  Store price was 1599.00 and the used one I got was 1100 so for my use case this was a great purchase.

Just an occasional user, then go for this one, they aren't THAT annoying but I could see watching a marathon of your favorite movies I'd yell out after the first 1.5 and say forget it.Kinda wish the ports were centered in the rear of the TV rather than the side since not all peripherals will be on one side of the TV so potentially different sized cables are required.

The TV's I purchased are:1.  Sony Bravia XBR55HX929 LED LCD TV2.  Sony Bravia KDL46NX720 LED LCD TV3.  Samsung PN59D8000 Plasma TV4.  Samsung UN46D7000 LED LCD TVOut of all four, I would recommend the Sony KDL from a performance and price perspective.  The KDL was $1,200 as compared to the XBR at $2,699, and honestly most people won't be able to tell the difference between the two.  Save the money here.  But I love both of them.  I would recommend the Sony HTCT550W Sound Bar though, it makes a great step up in sound if you don't want to go the whole home theater route with speakers all over a room.I am less enthusiastic about the Samsungs.  The Samsung PN59D8000 went in my home theater room, and it does have a great picture and I love watching basketball games on it, but it does emit an audible buzzing noise, and it is really noticeable when you sit directly in front of the TV about ten feet out.  When the Home Theater guys got me set up, they said that was normal for a plasma to emit a low buzzing noise like that, and that it wasn't a defective tv.  I wasn't aware of that when I bought a plasma, so heads up.The worst tv on my list is the Samsung UN46D7000.  I wanted to like this tv, I really did, as it is a great looking tv with the clear bezel and sharp looking silver stand, but the performance is so far below the other tv's on this list it isn't funny.  Quite simply, it can't handle sports and fast motion without going blocky and an extreme amount of blurring.  And, the tv was $300 more than the Sony KDL46NX720.  Save $300 and go with the Sony, you'll be better off.  And yes, I spent one whole evening trying different calibrations from other user reviews to attempt to give my  tv different settings to help with the issue, but no luck.  I would not recommend this tv.Overall, since plasmas apparently emit a low buzzing noise, and the UN46D7000 has some severe performance issues, I would go with the Sonys.

No comment on sound performance as I have it hooked-up to my home theater system.  Still learning the internet capabilities.  The TV not only is an awesome performer, it is beautiful aesthetically.  The thin bezel makes it appear like your looking at a floating picture.  Friends have made complements on the TV.  The screen does reflect sun coming into the room, which forces me to close the shades.

The picture quality is amazing without any fiddling around but if you are videophile like myself there are tons of adjustments that can be made to make the picture per your likings. A lot of DVDs/BDs come with video calibration screens that can be used to calibrate the TV for the best quality. DVDs and BDs look amazing BTW. I did notice the clouding that others are reporting when the picture goes from bright to black, however I did not find that annoying or even noticeable since in 99% next scene gets brighter and the clouding disappears or doesn't get noticeable anymore. I understand that why some are bothered by this just 'cause they know that it is there, but as I said I don't find it as something that would ruin overall experience.The TV had lots of internet features, and I found few that I just can't get enough of. One it the build in browser. It brows the internet without any problem, but it does not play ALL video contents of the internet. I does however play most important once like YouTube. If I find some that are unplayable by built-in browser I connect my laptop to the TV and make TV as my screen. I had to do this only once though. From time to time it does have a glitch since simetimes I would want to access any website and it would keep restarting the browser. I found out that turning the TV on and off fixes this issue. It also turned off on me twice within the first two days of use, but this had not happened again ever since. I was browsing internet at that time. Another useful feature that I am using all the time is connecting the TV to the home network where I can play content from my computer that has files shared directly on the TV. Since the TV has the wireless adapter, there are no wires required for this and the wireless network connection on the TV is preety easy. I also watched on movie on NetFlix and the overall quality and experience was superb.Another feature why I love this TV is that it seamlessly integrated with my HT-S9400THX home theater system and Samsung BD-D6500 player. I just hooked them all through HDMI and they all talk with each other while I just use the remote that came with the TV. Only time that I need the other remotes is if I need to tweek something in the home theater system. Otherwise the TV remote can control all three devices. I also downloaded apps for my Android cell phone and user my phone as a remote control however since the TV remote can control everything I use only that remote which BTW has fully QWERTY keyboard on it.I used the TV's sound directly for a couple of days before I received the home theater system and the sound was ok which I expected. It was not bad, but not anything exceptional either.I did use 2D to 3D feature and though that the 3D effect was ok. I had to sit close to TV though to get the full effect of it. I did not watch any 3D made movies (yet).Overall, I would give this TV 4.90 stars because of the browser glitch and clouding of the screen.  However, all of that above mentioned problems are really minor for me and unnoticeable they are not ruining overall experience that this TV offers. I would definitely recommend this TV.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Size Just Right.", "Author": "Prell", "ReviewID": "R1B48UIXTVHCE9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the Samsung 60\" 3D 7000 series about 2 months ago.

There are dozens of ways to adjust the lighting, contrast, colors, refresh rate etc. You can have it done professionally with a computer for optimal color setting. This is advisable if you are not willing to invest a few hours of tinkering to get the colors lifelike. You can find several posts that will give the settings of other owners. I found these did not work for me so I concluded that every set out of the box will be slightly different. One persons presets I used had the pylons for the football game almost pink in color when they should be orange. I also noticed that color changes vary greatly between mediums and even between TV channels.Once the colors are dialed in the picture is amazing.I have noticed some light bleed in the corners on dark screens but it is intermittent and does not affect the picture of a lit screen. It's a minor nuisance but at this price should not exist.This set has a glossy screen so if you have a light source behind your seating area you may have issues with reflection and glare.Hdmi ports are located on the right side of the set so if you are wall mounting you will need 90 degree cables or adapters to keep the cables out of sight.2D to 3D conversion does not really work, and it usually darkens the picture too much.3D bluerays look fair but not as good as the Panasonic plasmas. I bought a bundle that included the cheapest glasses so that may be part of the issue.The apps for the most part are lame. Vudu, Pandora and Netflix are nice though.I cannot get the wireless to sync to my router. After multiple attempts I gave up and hard wired it.Standard bluerays look amazing.PS3 games are clear with no lag.Sports look great with no motion blur.Bottom line this is a good tv but there are still problems with light bleeding and wireless networking. 3D is still gimicky and you will be hard pressed to find a lot of sources/broadcasts.

I received the phone call saying the shipping company would like to schedule a delivery with me. The only delivery dates were Monday, Wednesday and Fridays. Of course, my only day off is on Tuesdays. The only way I could get my TV was to travel over an hour to the warehouse where my TV was being stored. The whole process was really annoying and time consuming. After getting the TV hung and turned on I noticed the top portion of the screen (about 6-8 inches) there was a dark line across the screen. I tried to adjust the setting but that was no help. After about a day or so the TV started to turn on and off all by itself without touching a button. After doing some research online and in some forums I saw there is a problem with the TV getting too hot and turning off. I am not a expert with all the tech talk on electronics but it seems to be a big problem with the Samsung TVs and some sort of mother board that needs to be replaced after a few years. My new TV did not even last two days. All the money that you spend on these TVs the product should last far longer than what they are.The only thing that came positive of my purchase was that Amazon was there for me 100% when I complained. They ordered a new TV and it delivered within 5 days (of course not on my day off). The company took the damaged TV back as well. After getting the new TV and having it hung I am very happy with the purchase. It is by far the best TV I have owned and I still have not used all the features but I am looking forward to them.

In short, I'd give it a solid 9/10 overall.The list of things that are suboptimal in my appreciation: some white light bleeding is visible along the edges when the room is dark and the TV is showing black images. To connect a laptop/PC to it digitally you need to buy an expensive DVI to HDMI cable since the TV has no DVI input (it does have VGA, though, but that's not digital). The navigation on the hard disk is quite difficult and quirky (content not showing up, some directories cannot be entered, etc.) but more often than not I can manage to do what I want in the end. The applications in the Smart Hub are nice in theory, but it's a pain to provide keyboard input using the remote, which makes everything which needs such input (e.g., browser, YouTube) unusable in my view. Skype voice/video calls don't work out of the box, you need an extra 100+ device with microphone + webcam. The nasty thing is that you cannot just connect an over the counter microphone for voice calls without video; there is a PC Audio IN which you can connect a microphone to, but it's not usable from Skype.Ok, the may seem long, but in fact there are mostly minor annoyances. On the bright side, for someone technically oriented with very high demands, I found the TV very satisfying. Many people say they have a problem with the remote; it's not the case for me, but I agree the TV (and its remote) are for people who want features, not simplicity of use.One last note: I couldn't care less about this 3D hype, so I haven't really bothered checking how well this TV is doing in this regard.

I wish more TVs were like this without the acres of flimsy, prone to scratches, glossy black plastic.  The extremely thin bezel makes the picture pop out at you but at the expense of edge lighting issues it seems.I use external speakers so no comments on the speakers.The streaming features work fine for the major applications (Netflix, Hulu Plus, VUDU).  But streaming will be handled by my blu-ray player for the most part.The colors are very vibrant and the whites are very bright and the blacks are good as long as they are not near the edges.  I was fortunate enough to get the 303 screen which handles the edge light and uniformity issues better than the 301 and 302 screens.  But this TV still has those issues.  And I wish other viewers would STOP saying it's only an issue when going to commercial or when the credits are rolling after a movie because the edge lighting leakage is noticeable whenever there's a dominant dark scene.  I'm willing to live with this but it's a definite drawback.Motion issues if calibrated correctly are mostly unnoticeable being noticeable mainly when you're getting a weak signal.This TV replaces the Samsung Plasma PN59D8000 I returned dues to the buzzing sound.  I now have no buzzing sound but the overall picture is not as good as the Plasma.  I'll take that trade off though (in favor of the UN55D7000).UPDATE 4/4/12: I just can't deal with the uniformity, edge light leakage and motion issues.I'm returning this TV and exchanging it for a plasma LG 60PM9700 unit.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Totally AWESOME!", "Author": "TVmanNYNJ", "ReviewID": "RD5PWMRX1MDER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HOLY S*** !!!

Overall it has worked well, with a few issues that have since(hopefully) been resolved.  To start with the good.  The picture is great, much better than my parents HDTV bought the year before.  The picture is sharper, more vibrant, and more life-like without having that too-digital look the stores like to use.  The blacks levels are much better as well.  It is worth noting that if you are going to watch in complete darkness, the screen does take on a dark grey look and some very dark scenes can get muddled in this.  However with just a small light on off to the side, the black levels look quite black in comparison.  The key is to turn downt the back lighting to a level below 10 (I use 6 myself).  Blu rays look awesome and DVDs are quite good, and look actually as good as blurays do on the parents TV.  The menue gives a wealth of settings to adjust the picture, although a good calibration disc is advised for this.  Now for the issues.  The biggest issue I encountered was with the bluetooth module.  This unfortunately went out after a couple months and the remote(qwerty side) and the 3D glasses wouldn't work.  However Samsung acted swiftly when contacted, and a technician came out a few days later and replaced it.  He did mention he has had alot of calls about the bluetooth having problems and wishes they would go to a different form.  But since then (about a month) it has worked fine.  Second issue is the remote.  I have come to realize it eats batteries very quickly.  I thought the remote was not working and Samsung sent me a new one.  I have since found that cheap batteries last a ridiculously short time in this due to the bluetooth side.  The way to know is that the qwerty side will not stay loaded if the batteries are low.  Best advice is to stock up on good alkaline AAA's or even a couple sets of rechargables.  Third issue initially was the wifi connection.  Initially when I got the tv, and then after having to reset it after getting the bluetooth module replaced, the set had a difficult time remembering my wifi settings.  However in each case it would suddenly start remembering and then it would be fine from then on.  Don't know why, but I'm glad it does now.  The processor in the tv must not be very fast because some things on the web that should work fine are very slow on this.  However other things that seem more processor heavy like youtube videos and some games in the hub run fine.  It must be a driver thing I think.  There are the usually things people have mentioned before.  There is a slight amount of uniformity issue in mostly solid blue screens(ocean scenes/sky scenes) but not really evident in other colors.  And there is a small amount of light bleed seen at the edges, but by turning down the backlight this is largely gone (except one small spot on the lower frame).  As others have said in some all black scenes the picture takes on some cloudiness, although mostly this is on websites or smart hub pages, otherwise all black screen effectively turn off the screen and goes completely black for these (such as transitions scenes in some movies).  So overall the tv is solid and a good performer.  I hope to get HD programming soon, as the blurays and other things on the internet/smarthub in HD look great.  I know it should because on the parents lesser HD tv, their HD looks good, so it should be great on this tv.  And Samsung's customer service is pretty good as they have help in getting the tv working as it should.  Hopefully that is the last I need to contact them though.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R14DCALSZ0DT62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this TV about one month ago.

That being said if you ever feel like making a stupid purchase or just happen to have money to throw at the wind then you might as well purchase this television set!!!  Your eyes, your family, your friends and your ego will all thank you.  Your wallet not so much...Really I am a fan of beautiful quality products.  I bought my first HD television three years ago, It was a 32\" 720 Samsung touch of color series HDTV.  For the price of that set I could have easily bought a 37\" or 42\" 1080 Toshiba or Sharp that were not as aesthetically pleasing.  This was very much the case when I bought the UN55D7000.  I paid $2400 for the set and for well below that price you can get a comparable Toshiba, Sharp, or probably 3 Vizio's.  None of those come close to how amazing this set looks.  Samsung has made a choice to offer better looking (opinion) TV sets at a premium and Im a sucker.As soon as I got this bad boy connected to power it sat in my living room broadcasting static.  The .5\" border trim/bezel made it appear as if the static was magically being broadcast into thin air.  I just sat back like an idiot and watched static for 5 mins before I starting looking at how thin or wide the TV is.  Really how thin a TV is should not matter as it has nothing to do with picture quality and if your hurting for space then a 55' TV is not an option but wow this thing is thinner than my tooth brush.  For reasons unknown to me this factored into my purchase :)The TV has all the standard and not so standard bells and whistles, gimmicks and gadgets and I wont really get too deep on that lets just say your going to be using this TV and any TV mostly for watching TV so anything other than picture quality and TV design is just fluff.  It has Wi-Fi and bluetooth, you can connect to the internet and Facebook and no it wont replace your PC or MAC.  Stream or rent movies, download Apps yadda, yadda.  Really the whole App scene on TV's, Phones and Tablets are fractured and still a few years away from being truly connected so you should be ready for a small amount of disappointment when you load up Netflix with this TV and are not able to use the QWERTY side of the remote to look for movies.  Other than that it has enough distractions to show off to your friends, make them envious of you and demand that this years super bowl party or Manny Pacquiao fight be held at your house.Picture quality wise is where im not an expert.  The TV looks amazing to me.  I play my PS3, watch my 3D movies, Netflix and stuff so it does what its supposed to do.  If you want to nitpick you can find flaws in anything and I cant fault anyone who complains if they paid for a product and find something they dont like.  It does not matter if its $1 cheeseburger that has pickles even though you ordered no pickles or a $2400 TV thats backlit and you cant find that \"perfect\" setting. I however am completely satisfied with my picture.  All in All I would Highly recommend this TV.  I didnt even watch TV before I purchased this set.  When I look at my 32\" TV I laugh, seriously.  Put the two next to each other and my 32\" TV looks like a happy meal toy.  Until this set sits in your home you would have no idea you were missing out on something.  That \"it brings the room together\" feeling.  Well \"it brings my house together\".  Your family will never leave the room this is in.  Your friends will all make plans to watch every game, every fight at your house.  And for you, remember the sacrifice you and your wallet made?  Well your $16 gym membership is about to be canceled and spent on streaming video, your body will suffer, you will gain weight and your final reward will be a trip to the optometrist as your eyes will burn from becoming the couch potato that you were destined to become.  I hope you have insurance.*** After owning this TV for a week I have a few more things to add.***  First and foremost is the picture quality which is still amazing.  So Amazing is it that it makes everything in HD look so real it looks fake if that makes any sense lol.  Basically almost anything you watch that is in HD actually looks as if you are behind the camera or on the movie set with the actors and this makes every detail stand out.  CG green screen and computer animation, make up and lighting effects, fake movie props and costumes, locations, all are not able to blend in well together.  These tools all hide well in standard (poorer) definition but with this TV not at all.  A quick Google search and I believe its called \"The Soap Opera Effect\" and having to due with the 240Hz refresh rate but I am not 100 positive.  Movies do look as if they were a soap opera or a History Channel re-enactment.  Another Google search and \"Motion Interpolation\" becomes the culprit behind this effect.  I personally like the way things look, other people dont but there are ways to reduce the effects and no this is not exclusive to this TV but all higher end LCD LED TV's.  So I read in other reviews that they have noticed lighting in the corners of the screen.  I have never owned LEDTV so I cant compare and yes I do notice the lights in the corner whenever the screen is completely black but again this bothers me none.  What did bug me for a while was the lighting sensor that automatically adjust the TVs brightness to the rooms brightness.  I found that the TV would change brightness several times even though the lighting in my room was at a constant.  I managed to turn this feature off and would probably not use it ever again.One thing Samsung didnt do very well at all and continues to neglect is its documentation.  The instruction manual on this TV and the E-manual on the remote do not adequately cover all its features.  Samsungs website offers very little outside of you posting a question and praying that some other customer will answer it.  You can email them but really why should you have to contact a rep when reading the manual from cover to cover is half the fun of buying a new product.  Documentation is key as there are features on this TV that i am just figuring out such as...... MEDIA STREAMING!!!  This is an awesome feature that you can pay for from VUDU and Netflix so that youll never have to Redbox or Blockbuster again which is easy to figure out or you can stream wirelessly from your PC or MAC files you own or *ahem* \"acquired\" without the need of a separate device!!!  This is beyond cool man I have PS3 media server (which is a free download if you dont know just google) and you dont even need to turn on or even own a PS3.  You can now stream movies and music over your wifi from PC to TV.  Now I have PS3 Beta Media Server for MAC and I was having problems with it streaming movies and the TV will only play my MP3s and not my WAV or FLACs but I was able to use VUZE media server ( a Peer to Peer program Free again use Google) and movie files that wouldnt play with PS3 server played magically on my TV no other device needed.  You may have better luck with PS3 media server if you have a PC im not sure, I tried to play a variety of files and sometimes the server would freeze so test it out and let people know but Vuze works fine and I know there are other media servers out there.  Once again better documentation would have helped as I was under the impression I needed a hard drive connected directly to the TV to view files.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Feels like you are there", "Author": "E.

I just couldn't stand watching dark scenes on the screen and the back light showed through making the dark scenes not as dark as they should be along the outer frame shame of the tv. That this tv hardly has a frame is partly what attracted me to it, but its lack of frame makes more room for the back light bleeding along the edges of the tv's frame bezel.

Unfortunately, after about 2 hours of using the TV, it stopped powering on. Trying to turn it on simply results in incessant clicking noise and a blinking standby light. A quick google search suggests this is a blown capacitor problem that seems widespread across different Samsung TVs.Samsung customer service went through several useless troubleshooting steps, including \"Plug your TV in to the wall instead of power strip\" and \"Press the menu button.\" After which they said they will have someone call me back in 24-48 hours to schedule a repair. Since I bought the TV with the hope of watching the B1G Championship Game this weekend, I'm not all that pleased with this response. It's even more frustrating if it is indeed a capacitor problem, as that would be something I could fix myself in 20 minutes (if it wasn't for voiding the warranty).Amazon reps were nice in setting up a replacement order, but that too won't arrive til middle of next week.

Sorry, I know that the Samsung is more modern, but I wasn't even able to delete a channel. You know that there are plenty of channels that you don't even care about. Well, I couldn't delete them.Third, right when I was getting out of the box I was already questioning the quality. When you take a Sony TV out of the box, you have a nice set up guide with big pictures in color and it is very easy to follow. You also get nice cables. With the Samsung, if you are past 40, you better get your glasses out or a magnifying glass. Forget about a nice big color guide. The cables look and feel cheap. Even the batteries of the remote are cheap. it didn't bring a lace to keep the cables on the back nicely tied. It has one, but you have to glue it to the back and it doesn't have a particular place for it.Fourth, I tested the TV with Cars using my Apple TV. This was the true test. The motion of the movie got chopped periodically. I thought it was me or that it was normal, but after a while it became evident that my Sony didn't used to do that. I also thought, maybe it is this movie, so I put another movie I had watched last night. I noticed the problem there again, though this was not any kind of action movie. Since I still have my Sony, I plugged it back to the Apple TV and tried Cars again. What a difference; didn't have any image delays.One last thing: the remote.

My 10 year old (unprompted) said he strongly prefers the old Samsung to the new one.The problem is that no amount of tweaking can get the setting such that I can see black and white on the same screen without major halos and/or ghosting around the light images.  If a solid grey screen is projected on the TV you can see big variances in the brightness across the screen.It looks GREAT, until you turn it on.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "You wouldn't believe how thin and light is this TV", "Author": "H.

Indeed, it's so thin and light that I was able to hand carry the box by myself. I was able to install it almost alone (my wife helped me a bit just to avoid damaging it). The look is a killer (bezel, depth and color). I do care about the design in general and especially for something that will take so much space in my living room. The unboxing and installation is pretty straight forward and easy. Just need to be patience and I advise to connect it to your LAN or WLAN from the get-go. TV will download few important updates before launching the Smart HUB (where you can see and download your apps). Sleek and nice UI but not a lot of apps yet. Samsung need to work on that if they want their Smart Hub to be used therefore relevant.I wish I can connect my TV with my Bluetooth keyboard for a better browsing experience as it nice to surf the web on a 55 inch full HD screen. Once the install is over you just need to plug in your stuff (Directv,Xbox, PS3 in my case) on the available 4 HDMI ports. Mine came with the brand new 3d starter kit and 5 movies (4 Shreck and one Megamind -Blu ray format) for free. Two out of 5 should be redeemed through mailing but you can do it online. Also there is a qwerty remote supposedly but that also need to be redeemed. Allow 7-10 days to receive it.The TV spec are amazing (aside the fact that I'm still not used to the image of LED vs plasma that I had previously). But when you fire-up a BR or any TV show in 1080 i or p, then wow the picture quality is just crisp, beautiful and sharp. The sound is not the greatest feature of the screen but for such a thin device, I'm cool with that (I have an amazing soundbar already anyway). I've watched 3D content (there is actually more and more content available) and it's nice but the glasses from the kit are not (ugly and cumbersome). Get yourself the 3D BR on the International space station to really enjoy your 3D feature or there are 3D channels on Directv that are good enough for a start. Overall I'm really satisfied with this TV and it worths the price. Samsung did a great job and I don't think there is any TV out there who can have the quality (Panasonic maybe) and mainly the design (definitely not Panasonic nor Sony or LG). One note to conclude : I wanted to post this review on the Samsung website as I'm thrilled with this awesome product. They did not like all the comments you see here.

There are digital to analog converters on sale at Amazon.com that are supposed to produce analog output via RCA ports red and white.  Having said this, I have purchased  an expensive TV that must be modified to work with my old sound system.About 3D, there is another problem.  I have discovered that the super bowl is not in 3D, at least not in my area and there are few programs in 3D, certainly not enough to justify the $600-$1000 increase in the cost of the TV.  Also, the TV must be manually set up to receive digital 3D and then reconfigured back for ordinary HDTV.  Cables for HDMI ports are different for 3D and so are DVD players.  One must purchase 3D glasses at $25 each. All things considered this is a very expensive toy for little gain and a lot of frustration.Having said all that, the picture is beautiful and one CAN get around the sound limitations.  Just keep in mind that a high end 2D TV will cost $800 less!", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "NO LOCAL DIMMING!", "Author": "M.
