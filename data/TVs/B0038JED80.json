{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Experience Using Toshiba TV In Home Theater System", "Author": "Jimmie D Mills", "ReviewID": "R3KKV3QBFHOF1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this TV from Amazon about three weeks ago, and received it one week later.  Although I was concerned about safe shipment of such a large object, it arrived in excellent condition.  The packaging, with foam plastic inserts to support the TV at all four corners, was quite impressive.Set-up was very simple.  I only had to look up a few points in the manual.  The manual is even written in legible English!The picture quality on this TV is excellent.  I watched a football game on broadcast TV, and that was a completely different experience from watching the same games on my old CRT TV.I bought this TV for use in my \"Home Theater\" system that I am still putting together.  Playing movies from my HTPC or watching Blu-ray movies really demonstrates the excellent picture quality of this TV.  Just as an aside, the remote is easy and fairly intuitive to use.  That's not a big point, but a poor remote can frustrate the user of an otherwise excellent TV.  This remote works well enough that it doesn't add any irritation to the total experience.It was when I hooked up the TV to my existing stereo receiver/amplifier that I discovered one point about the TV that is less than perfect.  I had not noticed any deficiency in the sound while watching broadcast TV or even watching DVD movies on the TV.  But once the stereo receiver/amplifier was hooked up and I could hear the sound over that set with top quality Altec-Lansing speakers, the sound quality was much better.  In short, if you want the best home theater experience with this TV, it will need to be supplemented with a good amplifier and speakers.  But I expected that going in.  I'm not downgrading the TV set just because its audio performance, with its small speakers, isn't quite up to what I get out of my 100 W amplifier and 15\" speakers.  Heck, each of those speakers cost almost as much as this TV!This TV set is great for what it does - providing an excellent picture.  The fact that it isn't also a professional sound system is irrelevant to its function.  Besides, if we have a home theater system, we will have the tuner/amplifier and speakers already for other purposes.Hooking up the audio output from the TV to a separate amplifier may be a trap for the unprepared.  The TV sound out is via TosLink, which is an optical digital signal.  I knew that from the Amazon description and pictures of the input/output connections for the TV.  I had already ordered a TosLink optical cable and an optical/digital to analog sound converter and two RCA cables to connect to my amplifier.  The total cost of those items was about $50.  Not a big deal, but just an advance notice to any purchaser of this excellent TV that you really do need the cables and D/A converter, because the sound from your existing home theater or stereo amplifier and speakers will be needed for the complete enjoyment of this TV.  If you have a more modern amplifier with optical digital input, only the TosLink cable will be necessary.All things considered, I don't have any complaints, and I would buy this same TV again.  In fact, I'm thinking about buying another one for my bedroom!Five Stars!  No doubt about it!", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 40\" 1080P TV", "Author": "C.

This Toshiba puts all others, including many 42\" sets to SHAME.Picture quality is fabulous. Sound quality is fantastic. Best of all are the many HDMI possibilities, composite and AV connections. PC compatible is another plus. Believe it or not, my all time favorite is the remote, which has the buttons in a white color to off set the black back ground. This makes it extremely easy to see exactly what you are doing, especially in darkened room with just your Toshiba on. However I will say that Toshiba should update the remote just a tiny bit. At least I think a button labeled TV/VCR is outdated. Prices do vary so do you home work. My set was originally USD662.00 and just 1 week later USD557.00.

The sound quality, as I was aware of through reading reviews and was prepared for it is pretty tinny and muffled sounding I really have to jack the volume up to hear it. The base of this tv feels like cheap plastic which is alright with me its pretty unnoticeable once the T.V. is positioned wherever it will be,  what bothers me is how far it sicks out the front of the television  so that the T.V. has to be pushed back about 6 inches more than I would like in the cabinet so it doesn't over hang the base of the cabinet. I checked to make sure it is on the correct way, and as there is a hole in the base back, there is no other way it could be installed. I had read reviews about the Toshiba LED light logo and how people didn't like that, but it turns off/on easily from the menu and is not the problem I was worried it might be. I bought this T.V. because of an over time payment option if I had the money out of pocket right away I would probably go with a higher end LED LCD for better black lighting qualities.. Right now I like the tv but I am hoping I will just get used to the poor spotlighting black qualities in the picture.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "A very good value for DLNA and 120Hz.", "Author": "cylon6", "ReviewID": "RE6Q1S5U4VPIE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV is pretty good.

After a few weeks, I decided to return it, as the picture was sub-par. I was now left to decide what to buy. My father in law has a Samsung, and everyone says Samsung is the best TV, but in the end, you pay MUCH more for the Samsung. I finally decided on the Toshiba. I set it up, connected the cable via HDMI, and WOW. It blew the Vizio out of the water! The picture is so nice on this TV, that I would say it is on par with the Samsung my in-laws have.I got the TV at a great price too. On top of that, a week after I purchased it, I noticed the price was lowered. I immediately called Amazon, and they credited me the difference in price. Excellent policy they have, but you MUST notice it and call to get an adjustment; they do not do it automatically.If you are on the fence about this TV, I say get off the fence and click to buy it. Sound is great. Lots of connections to choose from (although I only need the HDMI:). This TV costs less than a comparable Samsung or Sony. I say save your money, get the Toshiba, and you will be glad you did.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Update the firmware!", "Author": "Sparky", "ReviewID": "R35IMZP067D6IX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE THE FIRMWAREThis is very important if you are a video game player and/or satellite TV user.  I have an Xbox 360 and DirecTV.  I noticed whenever I changed the channel on DirecTV the screen would go black, then a blue bar with \"NO VIDEO\" would pop up for a few seconds, and THEN it would finally take the channel.  It does this every time I change the channel.With my Xbox 360, I had an issue watching Netflix through it.  If I was watching a movie through Netflix and hit the stop button or if the movie ended, the screen would go blank and stay blank.  It wasn't the Xbox freezing up as first thought, it's a problem with the TV.  If I clicked the \"INPUT\" button on the remote, changed to another input, then changed back to my HDMI port the Xbox was hooked up to, the picture would appear again.  This was the only solution to the problem......Until I just did a Google search and found out many other Toshiba users experienced the same issues.  Toshiba issued a firmware upgrade for this issue in November to fix it.  So if you buy this TV and experience either of these problems, update the TV's firmware.SETTINGSMy only other issue is when I change inputs and the settings reset.  There is a setting to turn \"Game Mode\" on and off.  Some of my Xbox games run smoother when it's turned on (the games appear more like they would on a 60hz TV).  Some games I prefer to have it off.  What I don't like is every time I turn off the TV or change inputs, it always changes my preference setting back to Game Mode Off.  If I'm playing a game with Game Mode ON, then pause it so I can flip to my DirecTV real quick, then switch back to my game, it turns Game Mode OFF.  I really wish they could make it so each input can have its own custom settings, so for instance when I'm on HDMI 1 (DirecTV) it's will have certain settings and when I'm on HDMI 2 (Xbox) it will have different default settings.  Maybe there's a way to do it and I just haven't figured it out yet, but if not, it would be helpful as different settings work better with different peripherals and having to go through the menu every time I switch to one of them to change all the settings manually is a pain.That said, I bought this TV as an upgrade to my Samsung 40\" 60hz TV.  I was debating getting the Toshiba or upgrading my Samsung to their 40 inch, 120hz TV, which would have cost $200 more.  The picture quality of the Toshiba is great.  You can definitely tell the 120hz difference as, for example, a main character in a TV show will \"pop\" out more from the background.  The audio quality is good.  It's not like I was expecting anything earth shattering there.  Other than that, I don't need all the fancy bells and whistles.  Quirks above aside, I have been very happy with the overall quality of this TV.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 40G300U", "Author": "William D.

I have a regualar DVD player and it upgrades the picture from this player.  Just after setting up the TV, I watched a movie that I saw at the theatre in 3D.  The picture was so clear, it appeared as if it were 3D.  The only drawback is the sound.  I am slightly disappointed but not enough to bring down the rating.  I have the DVD player connected to external speakers which make it more like theatre sound.  Compared to other tv's I reviewed prior to purchase, the inputs on the Toshiba are also a bonus.  It has 4 HDMI, a component, a composite,USB, LAN and VGA.  It also has an SD slot for viewing your pictures from a camera.  This is enough for any purpose.

Hopefully it will continue to function properly, but even with the minor software issues I still believe it is well worth the price.***THIS IS THE ORIGINAL 5 STAR REVIEW***This TV is probably the best value you'll find for a 40\" LCD. The picture quality is very impressive and with \"QSound\" turned on (in the menu under advanced audio settings) the built-in sound ain't bad either. I do find myself changing the picture settings sometimes when watching sports or movies, but it's worth it because the quality is so good.Here's a tip when using this TV: Start with one of the pre-set picture modes. Then go into Picture Settings and turn DynaLight off (it's supposed to adjust the brightness as the the picture changes, but there's a lag and it looks like crap) and then just adjust the contrast to your preference. It's a quick and easy way to get the picture looking good right off the bat and you can just adjust the contrast for sports and movies. I rarely have to mess with the other picture settings unless I'm watching a movie with an odd color tint, like Fight Club or the Matrix.All in all this TV is a great deal, is easy to use, and looks and sounds like it should cost more than it does.

The picture adjustment controls are why. I am not a technophile or anything but I have done my fair share of research on LCD HDTV's. I purchased this TV based on reviews I read here and the fact that I could get a 40 inch 1080p 120Hz for under $550. I see why now.The Toshiba does not give you nearly enough picture adjustment settings. It is very hard to get the white levels and black levels to a satisfactory picture. I am watching a movie as I type this and as many times as I have tried to adjust the settings the picture looks pixelated and grainy. I ordered a good action movie last night to test the picture HD quality and I was very dissapointed. The colors in the Toshiba are certainly inferior to the quality of Samsung. I was not really impressed with the 120 Hz aspect. The picture looks like a soap opera....kind of weird.I am sending this TV back after only two days. I looked at others and found a Samsung for just a little more. Amazon has a return policy in which they will pay for shipping! I love Amazon.Good things to say about this TV is that it is 40 inches.

Superb Gaming Mode", "Author": "1Dub79", "ReviewID": "R1UTMYW9M8KDQX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted another television. Last year, I bought a Samsung LN40C630 40-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV (Black). I paid quite a bit for it. I figured nothing would show better than that LCD. The previous year, I bought a LG 37LG30 37-Inch 720p LCD HDTV. I was looking for another 1080p 120 Hz LCD. I saw Brandsmart had this LCD on sale for only USD548.88.PICTURE QUALITYPros: The picture is vivid, and colorful. Owners will notice the 3-D-like 120hz resolution aka the \"Soap Opera\" effect. This is called the Clear Frame. Of course, if you dislike this feature, it can be turned off.Cons: I call the performance of picture quality 50-50 because the picture frames can be superb. However, other picture frames can be extremely fuzzy and pix-elated. This makes the LCD have an uneven performance. Unfortunately, this LCD has limited ways to control the black levels. Therefore, users WILL see many pix-elated frames on the screen, even on the HD channels. The limited picture options prohibits users from getting the best picture of this LCD.GAMING MODEFor those, who have a PS3 or Xbox 360, this is by far, the best television to use to play the game. The picture is only enhanced with an HDMI cable. I thought the gaming mode on the Samsung was great, but Toshiba's is even better. I was playing Call of Duty: Black Ops for PS3. The colors were increasingly vivid, images are sharper images, and extremely crisp sound.SOUNDSpeaking of the sound, it is very crisp. Not to mention, you do not have to turn it up to a high level, just to hear, clearly. My Samsung does not have intense sound, except when I play my PS3 on the gaming mode. I can turn the volume up to level four, and it is loud. However, I can watch a show, and have to sometimes turn it up to the double digits to hear.MISC FEATURESIf you want to control another device with this remote, it can be done. Look in the owner's manual on page 26-27, and you'll see a list of various devices, which can be controlled by putting in a code. Just think of it as buying one of those remotes, which you put in the code, and it controls your telvision, VCR, DVD, etc.This LCD even has a freeze mode, which can freeze a picture for 15 minutes. I don't see much of a use for it, now. I guess when I watch football, and rewind my DVR, I can pause a spectacular play. Keep in mind, the audio will still go live.For those, who want to monitor how long your kid plays video games, Toshiba has a Game Timer. This feature can set a time limit, between 30-120 minutes. Once it expires, it will lock out the input source for the device. In other words, a code will have to be put in, so the user can play the game. Keep in mind, this feature will give a warning of shutoff in 10, 3, and 1 minute.THE VERDICTThis LCD is pretty good. However, some owners may find themselves dissatisfied because of the inconsistence in the picture frames from program to program. Keep in mind, this television does NOT swivel!!!! This LCD is not worth keeping, in my opinion. I will be returning it for an LG 42LD520 42-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung TV ...

Again not so much a big deal as I tend to use the TV with ambient light available. Here are some issues that I can't overlook.1) Screen developed a green tint throughout. It was fixed by installing v1.07 firmware.2) Recently the TV intermittently goes black (loses signal) while using HDMI cables to my Xbox 360 or PS3.3) Today the TV locked hard and had to be unplugged while changing menu settings.Overall the TV has good color and contrasts but fast moving objects like a thrown football or baseball tends to have a ghosting effect. And for a TV that's 120Hz refresh rate that's a little disappointing. My opinion has no bearing on Toshiba as a company as i'm a firm believer you get what you pay for.

It isn't thin as a LED screen, but it is fairly light at 33-34 some pounds.Picture quality is somewhat lacking, especially when I hooked it up as a HTPC. The colors seemed a bit washed, but that could just because I need to calibrate the TV setting. I watched Community on DVD, and it looked great. 4/5 here.One thing I found interesting is that nowhere does it mention the TV's contrast ratio or response time. I found out that the response time is 8ms, which is actually worse than most of its competitors. I was a bit disappointed on the Response time, but again, it works fine. I have not experienced any kind of blurring or ghosting as a result of this.I cannot find anything about the contrast ratio. Given this, I have to say the contrast ratio is OKAY even without looking at the numbers. It's hard to compare it to a Samsung or Sony without having it side by side, but I have little complaints about the contrast ratio.There has been talks that the screen which Toshiba uses is a-IPS (alpha IPS), I'm not sure if this TV uses a MA, TN or IPS screen. Could be any of the three.Overall, this TV is a solid 3 1/2 - 4 stars. There are no glaring problems with it (other than a terrible menu screen GUI) nor is it anyway shape or form outstanding.

The only thing that kind of bothers me, is that the movies kind of look like a soap opera kind of picture, but then I read about turning off the clear frame, so I'll give that a try.The other thing is I have my VCR, DVD and TV hooked up to a Sony surround sound system. The surround sound system works fine, but the only problem is that if I have the TV sound and the surround sound system both on I get an echo, there is a second sound lag between the TV and surround sound. I didn't have that problem when I had my CRT TV. Don't know what to do about the lag.Anyway, I love this TV, can't wait to get my new Dish HD receiver next week and watch TV in HD.Also best part is I bought this TV for only $452 at Amazon brand new. Amazon must have been having a sale on this TV, because 2 hours after I bought it, the price went up $127.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "retiree", "Author": "Big Jim", "ReviewID": "R2YAR8D8SZUIHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first HD Tv and it is great.

And I will appreciate your comments regarding to it.Pros:PRICE! C'mon you all know between $540 to $590 is a very good price.4 HDMI, very good quality, I just tested them with my new HDMI Cables attached to my PC and played a 1080p video. Looked great.GAMING MODE is very good, no delay at all.120 hz (Clearframe) Rocks! It is a very nice visual addon for this TVSpeakers are good, they are normal and effective, but if you want awesome audio quality buy a home theater.Video and TV looks great too.The TV is very light weight.Nice looking TV.Remember the TV has other inputs like PC port, usb, component and composite.Brightness and backlight are also excellent and you can also adjust them.CONS:The remote control sometimes didnt get recognized inmediately. But I believe it was because of the bad quality batteries included. I used Nickel-Methal Hybrid batteries and worked totally better (just remember to point to the lower left of the TV)The menu is kinda difficult to understand, but after you read the manual (I know its boring to do it, but it is needed) and you play a little bit with it, it will be good and with nice options/combinations in order to set the TV the way you want.--------TIPS:I know some of you are having flickering and/or flashing issues, you can get rid of it by TURNING OFF the Film Stabilization.If you do not like the SOAP OPERA effect in your TV turn off the Film Stabilization option.Film Stabilization is located in Advanced Picture Settings.For Support regarding this TV  go to the Toshiba Support Website.Also I recommend the firmware update which can be found at the Toshiba Support Website.Now the basic question for every review... DO I RECOMMEND THIS TV? .... YES I DO! It is not perfect but it is a very nice one! So do not feel afraid of buying it.

The sound is adequate although I do want to add a home theater system eventually. The SD picture on some channels isn't great but the HD picture is amazing. I've noticed some of the \"flashlight\" effect in the corners where the backlight bleeds into the picture. It is occasionally irritating but I can live with it. I've seen the same thing on higher priced LCDs so I don't think this issue is restricted to the Toshiba. The 120hz (called ClearFrame in the tv menu) is fantastic for sports but I do turn it off for some movies and shows to avoid the soap opera effect. It's easy to navigate the menus once you learn your way around.If you just want to watch SD tv, and depending on the quality of the feed your cable channel gives you, you might consider a smaller tv. Blowing up a low-quality picture will always lead to graininess (especially if you try and stretch that picture to fit the full screen). The problem was most pronounced for sports.

This happens using the HDMI input, I have not tested with VGA. This is the reason the set gets 4/5.)When you turn the TV off, some settings get reset.

I read reviews, and of the makers of of 40 in. screens, the toshiba stood out as having the least problems with artifacts and power supply bugs that all the makers have problems with.  This is due to energy usage constraints and the manufacturing process.  The screen is not totally black on the top and bottom corners when watching wide screen in a dark room but not detectable with the lights on.  The curved gloss black frame is like a mirror for room lighting, so diffuse indirect lighting is important or you get glare off the nice finish.  The remote is functional but nothing to brag about, but who uses tv remotes now anyway.  Most device remotes are more than capable of controlling tv functions, dtv works, but had some trouble with dish network, I suspect I had a bad or obsolete remote.  I also had an issue with the sde hdmi imput. The tv would not power off when using it, however the three other hdmi imputs om the back work fine.  Everything else worked as advertised.
