{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Vivid colors, crystal clear DVD picture and great value", "Author": "karnog \"Paul\"", "ReviewID": "R253SDYAGDO0O2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first laid my eyes on this set in the showroom, I couldn't believe it. I had just been ogling over a $10k plasma set an aisle away, thinking I would never be able to get a set with such crystal clear clarity and vivid colors. Then, I saw the 42WE610. Sony truly came through with an affordable combination of existing technologies (LCD and rear projection) to produce a value-conscious high-end set.Now that I am through gushing, I have had this set for about 3 months and will attempt a more objective review. I have watched many hours of DVD movies as well as analog, digital and high-definition cable. The only video type I haven't watched is VHS. The Con section below may seem bigger but it is only because I am trying to be more descriptive. Pros: Bright, vivid colors. Incredible clarity (over 3 million dots of resolution.) DVI input. Slim, sleek design. Light-weight, proportionate to its size (approximately 45lbs.)Cons: Reasonable angled viewing but still has some problems when being viewed from wide, side angles or from above horizontal (i.e. 90 degrees, or above the set, such as when standing or if seated from a perched position.) Speakers are mediocre but I would think almost anyone buying a set like this has at least some sort of home theater system through which they will power it. Analog cable is a disappointment, not because the set is directly to fault but the resolution of analog cable is so low. The picture looks grainy and just plain unremarkable. If you plan to watch a lot of regular (analog) TV then you may want to reconsider. Digital TV is noticably better and HD TV is great. One last con is that I still struggle with 16:9 aspect ratio sets. It's in between true wide screen and a regular TV so either the scene is stretched and cutoff in places or there is that annoying strip missing across the top and the bottom. That is really a personal quibble though and any set with this ratio is like that.Summary: Without being too repetitive, this is a great set at a great price, given the quality. Hook it up to a decent sound system and enjoy great digital broadcasting and DVD movies. I suggest getting at least a 2-3 year extended warranty since this is still new technology and its lifetime is unknown ...better safe than sorry. Watching traditional CRT TV's will never be the same after you watch this for a while. It is life-like and mesmerizing when displaying high quality DVD movies. It actually puts the theaters to shame since the colors and clarity are far superior to anything they can put on a big screen. I hope to see more technology and prices like this coming out over the next couple years.", "Date": "November 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "Worth Every Penny", "Author": "Henry H. Pan \"figmund\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z0G2ALX9MCEW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After spending months looking at traditional big screens, plasmas and the Samsung DLP, we decided on this technology.  I just wasn't impressed with what I saw from the DLP televisions. Few plasmas are true HD, and the DLP image seemed soft to me. The picture on the Sony Grand Wegas is crisp and clean, never soft (unless you want it that way - Sony provides several settings).  One of the greatest things about this type of TV is that there's no burn-in issues, so I don't have to \"zoom\" all the traditional NTSC. I much prefer to have black bars on the left and right than have, everyone look fat. The 480p off a DVD is stunning - and I can't wait to get an HDTV tuner hooked up. The black levels are quite good, it works well in our sun-lit living room, and the viewing angle is very wide. Strangely, the viewing angle gets better after the TV has warmed up a bit.  We happen to have a Sony digital camera, and with the memory stick feature, my wife can watch photo slideshows on the big screen - a bonus feature she really likes.", "Date": "November 21, 2003"}, {"Title": "Plasma with Reliability", "Author": "David A. Riley", "ReviewID": "R1RNR2XN94NZ60", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want to hang your TV on the wall I understand the attraction of Plasma.  If not (I believe the majority of people out there do not hang their TV on the wall yet)this is a real alternative with significant advantages.  If it breaks buy a bulb, not a whole TV as you would with Plasma.  Burn in is very unlikely with this technology, whereas Plasma is very prone to it.  Picture quality is better in my opinion in normal conditions, additionally you do not have to suffer the irritation of pixel distortion that currently is a fact of life with Plasma.There is no comparison with CRT, just the 60lbs of weight and the fact it measures around 14\" in depth make it worth the change for me.  The picture is truly excellent and unlike non LCD projection TV's the light conditions in the room have a minimal effect.  The viewing mode can be adjusted (vivid, standard etc)to taste and used to enhance the mood of a movie or offset light conditions.Freeze frame and PIP are cool allthough I don't see me using them very much, my brain can only watch one thing at a time unlike other people.  One bonus I did not know about when I bought it but love, is that I can insert the memory sticks from my digital camera and watch a slide show of my pictures in seconds after getting back from a trip.If you are a non geek you will love how easy and quick it was to set up, with no knowledge I hooked it up in minutes.If you want to move it any time you do not need to hire a fork lift and three big guys to help you, at a push I can carry it myself limited by size more than weight.At the end of the day it's just a TV and compared to CRT a very expensive TV at that.  But if you want Flat Screen, HDTV, that is big but light and has outstanding picture quality but you don't want to take on the Plasma risk this is one great package.", "Date": "May 11, 2004"}, {"Title": "Lamp only last for 1 year!

I was thinking of a Plasma screen but found too many negatives about those. I really hesitated to buy this TV at first. I heard that the bulbs go bad within a month of purchase. Luckily mine has been running for 4 months without a problem.With low quality TV broadcasts you do have a little bit of the screen door effect. It's not that bad at all and you can barely notice it. I just probably sit too close to the television. It's magically disappears when you watch movies, or least I myself just can't see it.The picture quality is amazing with DVDs, especially Pixar films. I don't use the built in speakers much but they sound just fine. I suggest getting a good calibration DVD for this unit, such as AVIA or Video Essentials. It's a pretty good investment.I have a Playstation 2 connected to the TV with component inputs and widescreen mode in games make everything look so much better. I was worried about ghosting, but I have no noticed any of that and I do play fast paced games such as Gran Turismo 3 etc.I'm trying hard to come up with some negatives about this TV. There isn't many at all. When turning on the TV it takes 30 seconds to get a good image, but that's normal. If you accidently turn off the power and turn it back on it takes even longer. Not more than a few more seconds.The remote is well made. The TV has 6 input channels and I wish there was a way to instantly switch to the one you want instead of having to press 'input' up to 5 or so times.I also should note that at first I was worried that DVD players with upconversion and DVI connectors wouldn't work on this unit. They do work just fine, but stayed with my old DVD player when I realized it wasn't worth the $199 upgrade.UPDATE: June 10th 2006Had my first EVER problem with this television. The picture would come up and then disappear after 5 seconds. When I turned off the TV the red light would flash 5 times. All I did was a little research and I found out I needed to replace the \"Lamp Driver\". It cost me a couple hundred and I did it myself. Problem fixed! Dead TV one day and fixed the next!", "Date": "October 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great value and performance", "Author": "Matthew T. Weflen \"Matthew Weflen\"", "ReviewID": "RFZVB7T956YDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "How can someone say great value for a $2500 television? Well, compared to comparably sized plasma and DLP sets, the 42WE610 is inexpensive.Cutting to the chase - This set will appeal to you if:-You desire a very bright screen (this set is BRIGHT!) which can perform even in daylight-You would like a slim TV (much smaller than CRT, about a foot deep)-You see rainbows on DLP sets-You don't have $4000 or more for an HDTV plasma (not EDTV panels which are cheaper)This set's cons are:- a somewhat lackluster black level (which can be tweaked very effectively by either professional calibration or online research)- sporadic reports of problems, which all seem to be resolved as of mid-2004.Subjectively, I feel this set outperforms plasma screens, as the pixel structure is not as easy to see, and for the brightness levels achievable (wouldn't want to burn in that plasma!).I also feel it outperforms DLP, because the picture is less noisy  and there are no rainbow effects (trails of color on high contrast images caused by the viewer's perception of the color wheel which separates 1-chip DLP white light into colors). DLP has slightly better blacks, but they're very close. In my opinion, the Grand Wega generally produces a picture which is less noisy and more \"film-like.\"In summary, anyone would be pleased with this set's overall performance. I haven't regretted the purchase once in over a year.", "Date": "February 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this product!", "Author": "Adam L.

I use it a great deal, even still, and has been nothing short of perfect.  I bought it at Crutchfield, a local tech store here, which matched the price for this item that was at that time discounted at Circuit City (now defunct).  I think I paid about $900 new.  It was $1400 at Crutchfield, but they matched the offer.  Works beautifully still, many years later, and works great with PS3, a BlueRay player, HD cable inputs, and I also added connectivity to my local computer/media center.  Has never let me down.

That doesnt even tell you half the story. Well I have this amazing TV set but in the 60-inch. I bought it back in 2004 when it cost $5,000 dls! yes can you believe that ? I also cant believe I spent that much but could have not been happier. When it comes to TV's Sony is a brand you can always count on, We are almost in 2010 so ive had it and watched it pretty often for almost 6 years and I just barely had to replace the projection lamp on it last week! One thing I also liked about the lamp is that it never caused the picture to go dim or gradually distore the picture quality. That may be inconvenient for some people but I always plan ahead and I had bought a replacement lamp after the 3rd year so I was able to quickly replace it. When the lamp goes out it also has a small red light indicator on the front panel of the TV which tells you that so thats a big plus!Now to the technical aspects of it, the picture and sound quality is vivid, clear and amazing, it doesnt matter if you have a well lit room or a darker living room, One thing I didnt like too much are the 3 different picture adjustments options it gives you, when you try to adjust it from the remote control its hard to really get it just right, but once you get it just right it gives you a beatiful picture. I only tried the HD for one NFL season since it was a lot more back then to get HD then it is now but during that time I experienced amazing HD quality which almost puts you right in there.Sonys are a bit pricier than some phillips, LGs, Mitsubishis and other brands ive seen out there but its worth every dollar. Everytime I walk by the open items section at best buy or see returned items at other stores or online you always see all those other brands expect for Sony. If you are going to spend alot of money on a Big screen TV you want it to be not just good as far as quality but also durable and that is what you will get with sony. Ive always heard many good things about Samsung which is probably the next thing I will try since they are much more affordable now but in my main livingroom I will continue to enjoy my grand wega TV. One other convenient thing about this TV unit is that its very light, you can move it around easily to connect extra devices or simply to move around. The screen doesnt connect much dust and doesnt get affected by it, a small dry towel is all you need to get the dust off and keep it clear.Hope this is helpful to anyone looking to get this particular model.

However I took a leap of faith and purchased one anyway. It took me 2 weeks to finally find one as every store in my area was completely sold out of them (from 42\"-60\") & some store are still sold out to this date. That excited me more as I was not the only person who liked this tv. You can make the pictures the same size in PIP mode which makes for an enjoyable viewing experience as I play my xbox and watch my favorite shows. I have do not have HDTV in my area yet but I did hear it's night and day difference. However most cable company's do not offer a lot of HDTV channels, thus the low cost. But I do watch the discovery channel a lot so I will benefit from it. This tv is HD-ready: Fully capable of high-definition display when connected to an optional HDTV source.

The best DVD player connected to the best Plasma/LCD/DLP/LCOS TV will have negative effects on picture quality if you are not using the best grade of Component/DVI/Coax cable. Yes, you will have to shell out more money for theses accessories (in my opinion Monster Cable has proven itself in my house). However, this is the only way to achieve your large screen TV's maximum video performance. It appears that it's not only necessary but simply required! I get mad every time I read negative reviews on this DVD player or my TV when they never invested in high-grade video cables or, their TV is only 480i compatible & not 480p compatible (they can't properly use the DVD player's progressive scan feature). Please check your manual to verify 480p compatibility for your TV, as some are only 480i compatible while others are only 780p to 1080i compatible!!! Here is a tip to improve picture quality for analog cable/antenna viewers:Use a A/C powered, 2 port, coaxial, Electroline Drop Amp to improve analog cablereception. The 18 gauged Satellite coax cable runs from the cable co. to the Electroline Drop Amp in my house. The 1 Meter Monster Video 3 coax cable (gray colored wire) will run from the Electroline Drop Amp to the TV thus improving picture quality.
