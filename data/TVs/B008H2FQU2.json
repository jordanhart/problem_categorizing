The television was fairly easy to put together, for I did it all by myself. The T.V is not to heavy and fit sturdy on the base. The design of this T.V are smooth, sleek and  sharp with a super slim profile. The wide screen give you a wonderful viewing performance from all directions. The  backlight has a brilliant color and a contrast for a bright picture which is perfect. The picture quality is really good on this unit. The sound is not all that great on this T.V, but if you have a home theatre system you can enjoy the digital 5.2 surround sound. There is also a digital  HDMI connection, which I used to connect my T.V to my computer , so I can stream netflick from my computer to my television. I had to up grade my old cable box for a HD cable box and it makes a big differents. The picture color and quaility so much richer and bolder with both HD T.V and  HD cable box.Pros: Good price for such a big T.V, good picture, remote is very easy to use, design is sleek and thin.Cons: Volume could of been a little better.Overall I think the television is worth the money. If you're looking for an affordable television with great picture, well look no further, you have found it. You are getting 1080p for such low price,that is a steal. The only thing negative thing I would say about this T.V is that the sound could of been a little better. I know Coby brand is not as big as Samsung, Sony or Panasonic but I believe they did a good job on this television. I only have the unit for 1 month now, so I'll be doing up dates as time goes on.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "wonderfull picture BUT", "Author": "Albert I.

However, from a certain angle, it appears to be. This unit still has some body, so is able to include some acceptable speakers.

An external audio system would  considerably boost sound quality (especially a subwoofer), but the speakers are fine for my needs right now.Picture quality is excellent!  I also love the simple remote control with well-positioned, easy-to-find buttons as I'm mostly using in the dark.  I've had the TV for about 3 weeks and very happy with it, so far.  I did notice it makes some clicking noises for a few seconds after I turn it off, but that might be normal and I'm not bothered by it.Package arrived from Amazon in great shape and ahead of schedule (I love Amazon Prime).  Unfortunately, the package did NOT  include any of the screws needed to mount the TV onto its stand! This would have been a huge problem if I wasn't mounting it on a wall.

I have to say that when we set it up and turned it on for the first time, I was astounded by the clarity and brightness of the picture! I did not expect the quality that Coby delivered- I was anticipating a similar picture to those cheap tv's on display at the end of the isle at a \"big box\" store, but the picture was much more \"high end\" in quality. The tv was easy to set up, the menu easy to navigate and overall I just thought it was a great bargain. My daughter continues to praise the quality of the TV, especially when used with a gaming system and streaming video.Amazon is such a great marketplace to find deals like this; the transaction was seamless and I had our purchase in hand days before it was scheduled to be delivered.

I have a Panasonic Viera 50' Plasma TV in my main living room and I was looking for a good secondary TV to put in my lower living room area.  Now, if I was looking for an amazing, top of the line TV, I probably wouldn't go with the Coby, simply because it lacks alot of the bells and whistles that might be nice to have on your main TV.  However, Coby isn't marketing this TV in that way, so those weren't my expectations.I paid $300 for this LED TV, brand new from Amazon.  I will say, the quality of the picture is superb.  It rivals that of the \"name-brand\" units.  The audio leaves a bit to be desired, but it's nothing a sound bar or even a 2.1 surround sound unit can't fix.  I can't really think of any flat-screen TV that doesn't benefit greatly from additional sound hardware so that's not really a knock against the unit.If you are looking for quality TV on a budget, this is definitely a great deal.Sidenote: The TV makes a strange popping sound when it's turned off after being on for a while.

I wasn't completely dissatisfied until I plugged my PlayStation 3 to it. And the  quality was just garbage they should recylce these models . Spend about a hundred dollars more for one 2012 models.  I have a Samsung 32 smart hub tv now and it is perfect picture and sound and very advanced connects straight to my wifi. I love it.

My only reason I had bought this COBY 39\" TV from local instead from any online. Because of abuse by UPS employees, they don't care. From local store, my filmy box has no crush and torn what so ever. Because of large the screen, is more likely to get damage than smaller screen. Last Sunday night, we had watched the Super Bowl on our local CBS channel with the cheapest rabbit ear antenna that was purchased from Dollar Store. For 4 full hour of Game, without any break up and drop out. This means; COBY TV has very good receiver for lower income people that they can't afford the Cable and Dish Service. The great receiver will help people get free TV from over the air. For 20 air miles from TV Tower to house in poor location for TV signal with very good picture quality. \"You can't beat FREE!\" Reason I ail not give 5 STAR because of weak and tinny audio. But audio is nice and clear for good walkie talkie class, that is very easy to understand. For music and big movies, it doesn't have it. I had plug in my headphone, too much of lack of shield static noise from jack to my headphone. COBY has said, you can hook up your PC computer. \"VGA!\" Is the old school of the 90's. Most of newer laptops has HDMI out plus Mac Mini & new Apple Laptops just came out with HDMI out. This COBY 39 inch TV has 3 HDMI ports. Because of this TV has only 60 Hertz, you will hardly see any refreshed distortion from 8 to 10 feet away from sofa to TV set. The computer monitors is only 60 Hertz. And by the way, I had watched from YouTube in full widescreen, from one of the best YouTube video without hardly any internet compression distortion in the 1080p, I say, \"WOW!\" Remember; 1080p is greater than 1080i from the Broadcast TV Stations. I really hope this reviews really help the public around the world. Number One is not tested: I'll keep my finger cross, 'how long will this TV last umber COBY brand?' The temperature on the back of this TV is very cool, but the only power supply has the small amount of heat. The Bottom Line: Less heat/longer lasting/fewer break-down. Last comment: You will see USB looks on top of HDMI is for SERVICE by Tech. professional.

Mostly because I've been fortunate to receive the products I order in good condition.  The first order I received for this TV, the screen was smashed in near the top.  I thought \"oh well this happens\".  Kudos to Amazon for the excellent service in returning the item.  So 6 days later I receive my replacement TV.  The first thing I did was to make sure it was undamaged as the first one was.  It appeared fine.  I powered on the TV, and sure enough the screen had lines all across it and midway down the right side it looked like it was hit with a softball (although it wasn't cracked).  Either Coby doesn't package their products securely enough, or the product is just not built well.  Bottom line is I returned this TV for a full refund rather than trying for a 3rd broken TV.  You get what you pay for at the end of the day.
