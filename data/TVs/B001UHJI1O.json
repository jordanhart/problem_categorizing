I use it as a stand alone TV, plus as a shared monitor for 2 different computers (not at the same time). It handles all the various resolutions with ease, and you can customize variables for each input. Nice! ~ It was easy to carry & to set up by myself. The initial scanning for channels did take a good while. Of course, your mileage may vary! ~ The remote is kind of top heavy because of where the batteries are. It does everything you really need, but you might prefer a different remote. Otherwise, I'm quite pleased with this TV!", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good mid sized TV", "Author": "Art E. Misia", "ReviewID": "RRNMUBU5AG7EM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV got a very good rating in Consumer Reports. Knowing nothing about TVs, I purchased it without really having any idea whether it would live up to its reviews. It was easy to set up, and the picture and sound quality are very good. The viewing angle is worth noting...it's visible from a a very wide angle, unlike a lot of other tvs I've seen.

It is a great set with excellent picture and sound.  The one small complaint I have is the print on the on-screen menus is a little hard to read from the bed across the room.  This might not be an issue for most people.  We have the TV located 16' from the head of the bed.  The remote is easy to use.  Setup and connection was easy.  The set was shipped by J&R; and a signature is required for receipt.  J&R; added extra padding to ensure a safe trip.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality!", "Author": "Jan", "ReviewID": "R5HJLER0PCCGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this HDTV based on reviews and the price.

I like its picture and sound quality.  I also think it takes too long to scan channels, But I am OK with it.  The biggest problem for me is that the remote sensor is defective and I have to take the TV set to a service center to get it fixed.  I would question their quality control practice at manufacture.  I also doubt their overall product quality.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "JVC-32J300 HD TV", "Author": "Stacey in Ipswich", "ReviewID": "R2DBQJ8Y7WSSCE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have had this TV for exactly 1 month, so  far, very, very happy with both picture, sound, and ease of use-menu, which  though quite comprehensive, at least is easy to access for making adjustments-all adjustable category headings get laid out with one menu selection so tracking down feature that you may want to adjust is not daunting nor does it require memorizing several locations or wasted minutes (hours?) of trial and error button pushing, or owner's manual reference as with our other LCD TV, a Sony. I never know where to begin if something needs to be changed, or when a setting inadvertently gets changed, (too frequent) and I want to get it back on the Sony. Operation of JVC TV is much more intuitive.For the primary seller, J&R; Music World/Computer World,it came on the 1st day of a 3-5 day Delivery Range, on the day of my wife's B'Day, after preparing her for getting a late B'Day gift!

Simon", "ReviewID": "R2X75US5AYB1VG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I thought the sound and picture were outstanding.  However, the slow time moving from channel to channel was very annoying to me.  Even jumping to favorites was slow.My unit had a problem in that it would freeze up a few times a week, making the remote ineffective.  I had to manually press the power button on the TV.  I called JVC and they said I needed a software upgrade.  I downloaded & installed it but the same lock-up occurred only now, to restart it, I had to unplug it as the power button also froze.  I again called JVC & they sent me a UBS flashdrive with the update loaded on it... didn't work.  JVC then said I had the option to take it to a service center or return it.  I did the latter.  I didn't exchange it because I didn't want to take the chance that the lockup would be a bug in all of this model.  But I didn't see any complaints on this from any other reviewers.I had paid a reasonable $499 for the unit a month & a half prior to the return and then found that the price had dropped to $419 and at another dealer to $399.  Suspiciously cheap for a TV that Amazon says retails for $849.  Checked out other TVs on Consumer Reports and based on their reviews and many customer reviews decided to wait until the features of all these LCD TVs improve.  I hate to wait because these converter boxes, mostly paid for by the government are crap.", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "RS9PNXOY3LH07", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The quality of the picture with this set is very good.

The picture clarity, color and black levels are all really outstanding and it has one of the widest viewing angles of almost any other flat panel television out there. The sound is decent for the room size (12x14). I've have owned the set for about 3 months now and have absolutely no complaints. You can't go wrong with the JVC.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great 32\" LCD if you can find one", "Author": "Sean Smith \"smithy4282\"", "ReviewID": "R17DBFK52HHG1M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this set as a Christmas gift a few years ago. Unfortunately I had to sell it a while later but I did get some good use out of it before that time. This was the first real slim HDTV that I ever owned and I will say that the picture quality on it is excellent and the sound quality is very good as well.The set has your standard features that you'd look for in a set of this size. One thing I will say in looking at sets of the same size I would look and not believe that the screen size is only 32\". This is probably due to the bezel around the outside of the screen being slightly wider to account for the speakers at the bottom. And those speakers put out some very good sound quality and I never had too much difficulty hearing what was going on and only had to really turn up the volume for really soft audio.Another nice thing is the fact that this not only has HDMI, DVI and component but it also has some composite ports which allow me to hook up HD devices like a Blu-Ray player or an Xbox 360 but it also lets me hook up non-HD devices like a VCR or a Wii.There really isn't a ton I can say other than if you can get your hands on one of these I highly recommend it. The only thing I will say is since it has been discontinued by JVC the price on it is really going up and right now the $700 that most places want for it is a bit high for a TV of this size. I just bought a 40\" Samsung LCD for $550. But if you can manage to find it at a reasonable price like under $500 then I'd definitely consider this one.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tim Nolt", "Author": "Timothy John Nolt", "ReviewID": "R217ITTZKGVB1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No problems-picture and sound are perfect.
