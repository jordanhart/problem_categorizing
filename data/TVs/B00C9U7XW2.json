TV is wonderful great picture. Very clear and the colors........easy to setup and use. The sound quality is very good, we both have trouble hearing the other flat screen tv's we have, our home is large and has very high ceilings and we both have trouble with our hearing to begin with, but this has much better sound quality then the other 2 name brand flat screens we have. would recomend this to anyone. the only problem was the delivery......they used a different del comp and we had to drive to pick it up and it had been sliding around the back of the truck all day. when we saw this and asked,the del. driver stated, thats why they are packaged as good as they are..thank goodness it wasnt damaged. very very unhappy with the delivery.....", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Glitchy but tolerable", "Author": "J.

I had read the reviews about this problem but appeared to me the issue only lied with video games, its not. The refresh rate issue happens on bluray, netflix, ps3 games, hbo (cox cable), hbo HD (cox cable); basically everything.
