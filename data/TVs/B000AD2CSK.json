TV arrived within a week, and so far it seems to be a winner.  Great picture!  Though, this being my first 'widescreen' tv, I was surprised that even widescreen tv's still show letterboxing on most movies, I guess 16:9 isn't wide enough.Doesn't have a DVI input, which would be nice, but does have VGA.One little design flaw: the inputs are a little difficult to access, in back, facing down, under a ledge, would be easier to access on the side.", "Date": "January 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "This TV has an alarm timer!", "Author": "P.

Few descriptions even mention this feature and sales people in stores don't know what you are talking about. Thanks, Amazon.com for mentioning it! It works great and is easy to set up.", "Date": "July 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "screen format problem, quality problem, service prcoblem", "Author": "Eugene", "ReviewID": "R1YGP97Z66LFH2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It's impossible to change the screen format while watching DVDs through Component Video or HDMI input. It is always in wide screen mode. I tried to find a new firmware for this TV, but only newest Philips TVs has USB inputs for upgrading a firmware.Also, the remote control is very, very bad. It doesn't have the \"last channel\" button, and it runs on small battery (CR2025) which needs to be changed frequently.UPDATE: I had to repair it for 2 times over the 3 year period, and it's still not working as it should (I have an extended warranty). Every time I'm powerting on the TV - the screen goes black, there is sound but no image. I need to turn it off and on again several times to get the image. The customer service on the phone is ok but when you get to the \"Certified Philips Repair Center\", which looks like a grocery store on the corner, it seems like they don't know anything about Phillips. Last time i repaired it, I had two problems with the TV, and I told them about it, but while repairing they ignored one of the problems. So at the end TV is still broken and its scratched all around after i got it back.I'm just don't filling like i should bring the tv for a third repair, i don't like to be without a tv for a week and the service is so bad that i don't want even bother anymore.Bad experience! 2 stars!No Philips for me anymore!!!", "Date": "November 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Remote Control", "Author": "person \"Person\"", "ReviewID": "R3VO9RR3XL0SWH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great tv, but what kind of remote doen't have a \"last channel\" button?", "Date": "January 7, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "26-inch LCD TV; measures 31.7 x 18.8 x 8.75 inches (WxHxD) with base\n1366 x 768-pixel resolution, 16 ms response time, 500 cd/m2 brightness rating, and 600:1 contrast ratio\n3D comb filter eliminates cross-color, cross-luminance and dot-crawl distortion\nInputs: 1 composite, 1 S-Video, 2 component, 1 HDMI, 1 VGA, 1 RF\nTwo stereo speakers, 5 watts apiece (10 watts total)", "Name": "Philips 26PF5320 26-Inch Flat Panel Widescreen LCD TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JEES5QE4L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000AD2CSK"}}
