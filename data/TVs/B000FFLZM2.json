Feldman", "ReviewID": "R1QNJ7XJOI7BL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Last May, 2006 I talked my elderly parents into buying a \"new-fangled\" flat screen LCD...not an easy task considering Dad's old tube TVs were still working fine after 15yrs of constant use. We went to Circuit City and decided on the LG 37\"...it was the least expensive and seemed to have the best picture.Dad didn't want to pay for an expensive CC extended warranty because we figured if something were to go wrong with the set, it would happen within a year.We got the set home and installed...the picture was so good with just the coaxial cable connection that Dad canceled the appointment I had made with Comcast to set him up with a hi-def digital box.Well, everything went fine until July 2007...two months after the LG warranty expired, the TV suddenly stopped responding to the remotes...not just the LG remote, but another universal remote that he had programmed as well. He eliminated all of the obvious causes...dead batteries, blocked sensors,light interference etc. He had the TV taken into be repaired. The tech, after undoing almost 100 screws to get to the circuit board, said he found and repaired a badly soldered wire (which surprised me since I figured that these circuit boards are all solid)..that was the only thing he could figure was wrong with it. The TV/remotes worked fine for about 3 weeks and now the same thing has happened again. So my 89 yr old father has to get up and go over to the TV every time he wants to adjust the volume of change channels. I call it the LG Senior Citizen Workout.Of course the set is beyond warranty, so neither LG nor CC has any legal responsibility...except that people should know that there are serious manufacturing flaws in these products that are not easy repairable...even if the consumer is willing to pay for the repair.LFNYC", "Date": "September 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "stopped working", "Author": "TDPittsford", "ReviewID": "R1DZ3SUK4EAZ2W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "screen went black and unit stopped working after only 5 weeks from purchase with only normal use, nothing out of ordinary.  I was able to temporarily reset the tv and get it to work again by disconnecting the power for an hour, but it quickly stopped working again.  almost like the whole thing just locks up.  sounds like the same problem found on other other models.

Mcghee \"V_RocKs\"", "ReviewID": "R3VUAF4KD0JC03", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Went to the store to check this one out first hand. The reasons I bought were that it had a great contrast ratio. The picture was bright and had a lot of depth to it. Also you didn't get the graininess you get in some TV's. Like when the picture is on a persons face, it doesn't look like pixels are swirling and it also doesn't look like people are made into plastic figures either. A lot of the more known TV's, Sony, etc, had both of those problems and I wondered why people were paying twice as much.... Just to say they bought a Sony?", "Date": "July 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good deal for the money", "Author": "Rosemary Thornton \"Niece of Murder Victim, Ad...", "ReviewID": "R16P5M81M0AFYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the spirit of American consumerism, we used an unexpected bonus to purchase this extra-chubby television. When used with a High Definition tuner on HD channels, the clarity is simply stunning. I swear you can see the individual complexions (zits and all) on the crowd's face at the baseball stadium (which is how our HDTV is most frequently used).The sound quality is very good. We don't have surround sound or any auxillary speakers but the TV's built-speakers are first rate. The hubby and I live in a house with window air conditioners and we're both half deaf, so we're frequently cranking the volume way, way up and there's no distortion. Thus far, we've only gone 50% on the volume and that's enough to overcome the loud air conditioner and our own deafness.On the non-HD channels, the picture quality is still very good. The controls (and the remote) are easy to operate, but you'll need a magnifying glass to read the wording on the tv-mounted controls.We had this baby hooked-up and ready to roll in under 30 minutes, which is pretty darn quick. And thus far, it's been a great television. We also observed that it was one of the cheapest sets offered. How I wish we Americans could learn how to build things again...sigh. But this LG HDTV is very impressive. I'd highly recommend it.", "Date": "June 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Value for money for a top brand", "Author": "N. Khan \"goldenvision\"", "ReviewID": "R260SVHOGZF82L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality is very good and whilst this unit is not as picture perfect as the Sony, for the price, the LG is great value for money. The hard derive is handy, pity about the lack of a USB that allows you to connect to your computer. The speaker on the set is great, the design is modern but the power cable socket at the back of the unti is mission to locate when you first set up - but I suppose, reading the manual first should solve that!", "Date": "April 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Works perfectly  fine for me", "Author": "itsjustme", "ReviewID": "ROH7VW9ZXOPH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Literally, I dont see why people are complaining about this tv. I've never had one problem with it, and I've used mine for 6+ years including every single hook up you can attach to the TV including Wii, Xbox, older gaming systems, PS3, bluray players, even surround sound system, and hooking up a computer to show up on tv, i've used all components and HDMI connectors, and I've blasted the sound plenty of times on mine too including changing all sound settings around.I've yet to have a single problem out of it.I'm really being picky, but I am trying to find something wrong with it, and all I can say is when I turn the sound up real loud and the bass in a movie or something hits, you can hear it kinda vibrate in the speaker. Then again, this is not a radio sound system nor is the TV a 1000w amp to hold all sorts of power.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "TV went black after less than a year", "Author": "Lance Amater", "ReviewID": "R1DQJDCZ28D7TY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The sad thing about this TV set is that I really took the time to get the right LCD TV set and sadly after a year and a half the thing went black and I can't get it to come back on for any period of the length.Just not worth the investment and this leaves me with such a poor sour feeling towards all LG products, I'd stay away from the LG brand name forever.", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Never ending problems", "Author": "K.
