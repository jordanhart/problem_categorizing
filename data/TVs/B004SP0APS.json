It appears the TV was reviewed before it was released.  Since then, the firmware has been updated which shows Phillips is committed to improving their product software in the long run.  Also, you can't beat the price and features.  A trip to a local retailer showed how nice this line of TV's are.  The frame looks nice on the wall, with a consistant width all around and rounded corners.The picture quality is good and blacks are black with no bleeding.  120Hz display makes action smooth.  Sound quality is good and the speakers are on the back of the TV so if you are mounting on the wall, the sound gets reflected back nicely.  As a bonus, you get 4 HDMI ports.  Most in this price range have 3.  I have yet to try the Wireless Media Connect and Apps but I will update my review when I do.This is a great buy and looks nice mounted on the wall.Update: 11/25/11Still working great.  The apps and streaming from a PC to the TV also works good.  The only gripe on the PC to TV streaming is there is a few seconds of lag.  This could be attributed to the fact that my stream is going over wifi.

Also that not having analog RCA out jacks is a drawback.  BUT, my main reason for writing the review is that by going hard-wire ethernet to my router instead of wireless, ALL the media streaming issues are resolved.  The Media Connect that displays the Computer on the T.V. is very robust now (will still drop sometimes if I am streaming from a lap top in a different room, but not when my P.C. is hooked directly to the router).  So by plugging in directly to my network router via the ether net port, I am very pleased with all streaming.  I do agree that the wireless part sucks with Media Connect.

G. CHARLOT", "ReviewID": "RZLIBU2XTUL80", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This CCFL backlit LCD television has a pretty good price, and the picture quality is also pretty good \"IF\" you are feeding it an HD signal through an HDMI cable.  For the first week we had this TV, we did not yet have HD service from DirecTV, and I was a little disappointed in the image quality, but with the upgraded HD service that started yesterday, I am now much happier with this TV.  The picture clarity, sharpness, color saturation, and luminance are all as good as I think anyone has a right to expect from a CCFL/LCD TV at this price pointThe sound quality out of the set's speakers is okay, neither fantastic nor lousy. I assume that most TV's this large are probably going to have their sound piped through a stereo or SurroundSound system and external speakers, so the average quality of the built-in speakers probably won't be that big a concern for most owners.  Unfortunately, I have noted a potential problem with audio/video synchronization.  For the first several hours of watching this TV, we noticed an obvious mis-match between lip movements and the voicetrack coming through the external speakers. I started digging through the TV's Settings Menu and eventually tracked the AV sync problem to the \"Digital Natural Motion\" (DNM) feature.  Apparently this feature is processor-intensive, causing the video display on the TV to lag 1/4 to 1/2 second behind the audio, which is going direct from the satellite receiver to the stereo. DNM has three settings: \"Off\", \"1\", and \"2\"; the audio sync problem seems to be the same on both the 1 and 2 settings. Turning DNM off eliminates 90% of the sync problem. This allows you to have the audio coming from both the TV's built in speakers and your external sound system, however, the sound \"quality\" from the two systems is so different that it is actually unpleasant, at least to my ears, so I have had to mute the TV and have the audio only from the stereo.  When DNM is turned off, scenes with fast motion are noticeably reduced in smoothness, so DNM actually works; it does what it is supposed to do, I just wish it could be done without causing a 1/2 second A/V synchronization mis-match.Picture Format and aspect ratio: This set supports 4:3, 14:9, 16:9, and \"widescreen\" video inputs, so it can play both Standard and High Definition video sources. It has three HDMI ports, 1 VGA port for streaming video or still photos from your computer, and a USB port for connecting a Flash drive with photos or MPEG video. There are also female RCA jacks for connecting composite video and audio sources, Audio Coax input, and a WiFi dongle.EVALUATION OF CONNECTIVITY FEATURES: So far, this has been a total failure for me. I first tried the USB port. The owner's manual states that this TV is supposed to be able to display standard JPG (but not progressive JPEG), and MPEG 1 or 2  videos from a USB Flash drive.  I set up a 4 gig Kingston Data Traveller with FAT 32 format, and a few sample JPEG photos and a couple of small MPEG2 videos. The TV's \"Browse USB Device\" menu just shows a listing of empty folders and reports the flash drive as \"empty\". I don't know what else to try, as I can't make the format or the contents on this USB flash drive any simpler. Maybe this TV just doesn't like Kingston flash drives? The manual also states specifically that USB hard drives are NOT supported. This was a big disappointment, as I had expected to be able to connect a 500 gig USB drive with videos and slide shows to the TV directly. The TV is also supposed to support connecting to a PC computer.  After I got it home and unpacked, I discovered that this can only be done with a WiFi Router - which I don't have - and not with an ethernet cable. The set does have an ethernet jack, but this can only be used to connect the TV to the internet for firmware updates or to download content from NetFlix or other subscription services (which I have no interest in joining).I did some checking into the WiFi requirements, and to stream 1920 x 1080P video from a PC to this set, you will need a high-end WiFi router - the $129~$159 kind; the $29~$39 WiFi routers don't have enough speed and won't work.  I'm not about to drop another $129 on an accessory for this TV that I have no other use for, so the PC connectivity will have to remain an unusable feature.  For under $10 I can get a male-to-male VGA cable and just use the TV as a large monitor when I want to play videos from my laptop.THE REMOTE: The remote that comes with this TV is one of the cheesier ones I have held. It is small and feels flimsy, and the buttons have a loosy-goosy feel to them, with a lot of sideways motion.  The main left/right/up/down buttons that you use to navigate menus are not making a good electrical connection: it sometimes takes repeated presses to effect the menu movement. A couple of the buttons are dedicated to On-line content features.CONCLUSION: This TV is a perfect example of the principle \"you get what you pay for\". It is a lower-priced product with average (if not lackluster) performance, and some problematic features. It's service life and durability can only be determined with the passage of time, I can only hope that the internal components are all reasonably good quality. I have read that some Samsung LCD sets were manufactured with bottom-of-the-barrel capacitors that fail with only a few hours use. I hope this Phillips set isn't that bad. If you are on a limited budget and just have to have a 46\" TV, this set may be okay if your expectations aren't too high, but be aware that some of the features listed on the box either don't work the way you would expect them too (like the USB port), or require expensive accessories (high-end WiFi router) that you might or might not already own.UPDATE 2/24/12 - The DirecTV technician told us that our audio sync problem is partially caused by using RCA stereo patch cables between the satellite receiver and the stereo. He said if we switch to an \"optical fiber\" audio coax cable, the sound problem will go away. Our stereo is an older one, and doesn't have that kind of audio jack, so I can't test it.  Now that we have HD service, I can see a clear improvement in the picture and sound quality, so I have upgraded my rating from three to four stars.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worked Great....for 9 days.", "Author": "Limes", "ReviewID": "R2Q0N8C654JY95", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on March 18th. I was coming from a first generation LCD which crapped out.  The picture was great, and the sound was just fine.  It was easy to install and set up, and the customization features to set the colors, tint, etc were great.  I even really enjoyed the internet capability.  I had the TV set up on my wireless network and it worked flawlessly. Perhaps the only downside at setup was the fact that the remote is a standard remote so typing in information on the screen was a little cumbersome for setup.  With all that being said, you would think this would be a glowing review.In fact now the opposite is happening.  Last night, 8 days after purchase, I went to turn on the TV and all I got was sound.  I turned it  off, checked all my wires and plugs, and turned it back on.  Same thing, sound but no picture.  I called Philips Tech support, and they were very courteous and pleasant on the phone.  In fact at one point we got disconnected, and they even called me right back.  The issue was that all they could do is have me run through the same hoops of unplugging the TV and cable box, holding the power button for 20 secs, etc.  When none of that worked they told me I have to go work with an authorized repair company.  Now I am sure I am going to go through the same warranty hell that one of the other reviewers went through.For the price the TV was well worth it at the time with all the features.  I thought maybe that one other review was an anomaly so I went ahead and purchased the TV.  Now I am telling anyone that is watching these reviews...Don't do it.  There is clearly something wrong with the TV internally that should be recalled, but I doubt that Philips will do it.  Stay away from this TV, stay very far away.Update:  Philips did send me to an authorized rep, and after calling them the first day and them acting like they had no idea what I was talking about, I got nervous.  Someone finally called me back a day later, but they just said I had to talk to \"Joe\" as he was the Philips guy.  At that point I didn't have the patience.  I returned the TV to the store I bought it from, but they would only let me exchange it.  I did that, and so far everything seems to be working fine.  It has now been 3 weeks and it is all good.

Got it cause we liked the idea of being able to connect it to our Wi-Fi and watch Netflix on it without having to run cables from our desk top to our tv like we did with our older one. When we got it home everything seemed to work great. Was easy to set up, connected to internet really easy then about a month after purchasing it all of a sudden it would shut itself down all on it's own. I contacted the companies customer support about it and was told that it needed to be updated. We updated it and all was good for about 2 days, then it started shutting itself off again. We also noticed that it was getting harder and harder to run anything from the net on it. We moved our whole computer, router and all closer to the tv as they recommended so that the signal wasn't being blocked at all. Our router actually sits right next to the tv now and you guessed it, every day the tv gets slower and slower to the point of it's always freezing up on us. If you try to turn it off, it takes 10 minutes to do so. If you are watching Netflix, which Philips claims it's Netflix's fault for it not working but it works on every other tv in the house except this one just fine, and try to pause what you are watching, you have to restart the tv and go all the way through the process to restart what you were watching in the first place. It's the biggest waste of money we have ever spent and will never ever purchase a Philips tv again. I only gave it one star because it won't let you not give it any.

Also the sound is so sporadic, it is so loud with music and so quiet with human voices. So you can imagine if you are watching a movie and want to hear what people are saying and you are inclined to increase the volume, but at the same time the background music is so loud and you want to lower the volume.On the positive note though, the TV is really good to watch sports on.

I think a soundbar is pretty much a required purchase with this TV, but there is no optical audio out so your soundbar options are limited.The voice track is very hard to hear and as others have noted, the music by comparison is very loud.  It leads to having to watch movies with the remote in hand and constantly working the volume up and down.

Until just yesterday, it had been a relatively good product for us.  We had some issues with Netflix being dimmer when you watched it through NetTV, but when we routed it through the Wii, it cleared up the issue with the poor picture.  Yesterday, we attempted to turn the TV on, and initially the white light at the bottom came on, then immediately went out.  We have tried everything from unplugging cords and replugging, letting the TV rest awhile, etc....nothing.  It's completely dead.

This is my first LCD TV.  There is a very long (21 sec) power-on delay.  I didn't think this would bother me, but it turned out to be quite a nuisance when I tried to program a universal remote.  For universal remote operation, be aware that switching inputs is a matter of scrolling through inputs - you can't directly go from TV input to HDMI3 e.g., you have to scroll.  This relies on the remote remembering where it last was.  It's a minor nuisance, the Logitech universal remote I got can deal with it - once I figured it all out and programmed a 21 sec delay before the remote would try to switch inputs.The problem with the TV is the wireless side.  This is why I chose this model.  It can only play mpeg1 and mpeg2 encoded movies.  Today, virtually all you download is mpeg4 encoded.  So you'd have to spend a lot of time converting, if you really want to view content downloaded from the net and residing on a PC on your home network.  Of course you can also put it on a USB drive and plug it in (I wish there were a frontside USB!) but that does not help with the format issues.  In addition, it seems to be limited to certain aspect ratios.  Even mpeg1 with a 2.35:1 (12:9, widescreen movie) aspect ratio would not play.  If I deliberately distorted the format to a narrower screen it would play - distorted, of course.  What good is that...  Perhaps the movie I tried was a poor choice because of its aspect ratio - I have no idea how common this is.  All I got was an error code.  Tech support was ludicrous, in explaining the limitations.  Seemed to me their only training was reading the manual.  Well, guess what...  I can read also...  \"When it says network error it means there was a network error and it won't play\".  (!!!)  I spent a most useless 1/2 hour on the phone with someone to get nowhere.  The pause/start/FF etc controls on the remote also did not work for a streamed movie.  Definite room for improvement!Navigation overall is pretty cumbersome, I thought, but one can get used to that.The remote has 4 colored buttons that do not do anything and are not programmable.  Some back and forth with web support (tried phone once - not again!) revealed that these color buttons control some functions on some other equipment - possibly only in Europe, perhaps it does something on certain (Philips?) blueray or DVD players - I stopped digging once I understood they were not programmable.  The manual, even the 'extended version' that you can download, blatantly ignores these buttons other than identifying them as 'color buttons'.  Gee, I needed a manual for *THAT*.The firmware on my TV is March 2012 - perhaps a later version has improvements.  I could well imagine that at some point they may support mpeg4 which would be a big step forward.The MediaConnect feature also is less good than it sounds.  It needs a reasonably powerful laptop.  A netbook does not suffice.  I tried from a PC but half the time the connection did not get established - I have a wireless access point 12' from the TV, signal strength is not an issue, my network is pretty fast (1G wired and N wireless) and bandwidth is not an issue.  Tried from a wired desktop - connection issues also.  And of course you can't have the desktop in a different room since you need to see what's going on.  Hard to start a movie from the desktop, dash to the living room to catch the beginning.I gave up on the network media streaming stuff.  These issues were solved by purchasing a Western Digital TV Live - superb.  It has handled anything I threw at it - encoding, file types and aspect ratio have not been a limitationAs a TV - decent overall.  As a wireless device - useless.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV!!!!", "Author": "Alexander Kajayan", "ReviewID": "R1VIEHZENF986H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got it couple days ago, so far I LOVE IT!!!

Since then it has failed twice (will not power up). It came with a one year waranty from Philips which is pretty useless. On the first failure, it took four weeks to get it fixed.

Every time I call they tell me I'll just have to wait. This is an internal issue between Philips and their service provider, but I as the comsumer get no service. I can't recommend this TV or anything you might buy in the future that is covered by a One Year Philips Waranty. Today is August 29th 2012 and this TV which went belly-up on August 5th has still not been fixed.

D. Porch \"dennis\"", "ReviewID": "R1YRYWI1H6LKZK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV right after Jan 1, 2012 trying to take advantage of after Christmas sales.  The TV worked very well for the first 2 weeks.  My son had it on all day on a Saturday watching basketball games and he turned it off in the evening.  When he attempted to turn it back on after 20 minutes, he could only get sound.  Once it cooled down over night It again worked the next day.  We continued to have intermittent trouble over the next week.  When I called Phillips about the problem, I was told that they would send someone right out within one week to fix it.  They put me in contact with a contractor called Nexicore who told me that someone would be here with in a week but they first needed to order parts.  I should have figured something was not quite right as no one had looked at the TV and they were already ordering parts.  Some 2 1/2 weeks later, I called Nexicore back to find out that the parts had been backordered.  Neither Nexicore or Phillips bothered to call or Email me the delay.  When I first discussed the problem with Phillips, I had mentioned returning the set to Amazon and they stated that they would have someone right out to fix it or they would replace it.  When I called them back about the back order they told me that some one in the main office had seen the back order but decided that I could wait for the parts.Well the repair man finally came today, 2/ 27/ 2012.  He took the set a part and replaced both the power source and the \"inverter,' two large boards on the back inside of the set.  He plugged it back in and the set did not come on.  He then unplugged and held the on switch on for about 20 seconds, replugged it back in and it came on.  I told him that since the problem was intermittent, I feared that the set would again give us trouble.  I also told him, it often gave us trouble after it had been on for awhile and we switch it off.  If we then attempted to turn it back on, only the sound came on.  So I was fearful that his \"test' might mean nothing.  I explained to him that I turned the set on 2 hours before he came to attempt to  cause the problem when he arrived and indeed that procedure worked.  He turned off the set and turned it back on and only got sound.  Any way the repairman left insisting it was fixed.  Also interesting to note that I had negotiated with the repair shop to come at 9:00 AM and when I phoned them this morning when the repair man was late, they stated that they had a 2 hour window.  This was not part of the original negotiation.I call the repair shop back after the set would not again work  and they told me to call Phillips, I did that and they told me to call Nexicore the repair shop back and give them the original repair number and have them come out again.  I reminded phillips that we were over 5 weeks in attempting to fix the problem but they told me that I would need to go the same route again.  I called Nexicore back and the man on the other end was extremely rude blaming all the problem on Phillips.  He told me they could come out again but would again have to order parts.  I asked him which parts and he told me the main board.  I asked how long it would take and he told me five business days if they could get the parts.  I will not go into the rudeness of this man but will assure you he was no gem to talk to and would only screen at me and ask me questions most of the time continuing to talk without giving me the chance to answer the question.Next, I called Amazon and explained to them what had happened.  I was now a few days past the Amazon return date.  They told me to package the set back in the original packaging if I had it  and told me UPS would be by to pick it up.  They would handle Phillips and give my account credit.  While Amazon was polite and efficient, Phillips and their contractor were difficult to deal with.  For these reasons, I would not recommend buying a Phillips set  even though when it worked it seemed to work very well.  The picture was good the remote worked very well and the computer components worked well.DennisIrvine, CA", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "An embarrassingly bad product.", "Author": "K.

Even though you only pressed the down button once, it skips two or three entries.Repeat this problem with every other \"feature\" of this television.Once you can actually get past all of the monotonous waiting and unresponsiveness the TV works fine, but if I wanted a barebones display I would have purchased something else.
