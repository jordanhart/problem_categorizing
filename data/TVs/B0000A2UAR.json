My wife and I would love to throw it out, but since we just bought it, we are stuck with it for awhile. We have been letting it sit while we go to watch the older,smaller model.  If anyone wants a good deal, please let me know by e-mail @ hutchgolfs@aol.com.", "Date": "September 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "It's great til it breaks!!!", "Author": "Jlea \"JL\"", "ReviewID": "R1VGB0LQOJXCNK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this set 3 years ago and never had a complaint . . . until it blew a tube.  In fact, there are 3 tubes in this . . . blue, green and red.  If the green and red blow out . . . you might be safe . . . at least as of 2.15.07, the last time I spoke with the company (Zenith).  Unfortunately for us, the blue picture tube went out . . . and after waiting for nearly 2 months for word of \"backordered parts\" (that's no fault of Zenith . . . our fault for picking the unmotivated \"rich\"repair person . . . who evidently does NOT need the money) we were advised after twice calling Zenith ourselves, that the blue picture tube is \"obsolete\" and no longer available AND the grand prize is . . . there is NOTHING else to substitute this!  So, in essence, our three year old TV is beyond repair.  The finishing touch?  Unless you produce an actual receipt . . . you will not receive a replacement set.  This is the final thrust.  A cancelled check and a life sized photo of the actual set sitting in your actual house does not count as actual possession.  So, hang on to your receipts and pray that the blue tube doesn't blow out.  As for me and mine . . . this is where we part company with Zenith . . . forever.
