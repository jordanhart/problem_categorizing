None worked, they put me in touch with a company to come repair the TV. Not satisfied with that (would take weeks), I contacted amazon, got flipped to their \"large items\" group. The guy said \"Man that sucks, when do you want your new one to arrive.\"So great job amazon fulfillment services, bad job sharp. New one arrived a couple days later, shippers helped me pack the old one in the new ones box and even wall mount the new one. Very happy with Amazon, not so much Sharp.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV", "Author": "Jade Moore", "ReviewID": "REG89FPJQXXSI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "That being said it's almost too amazing. It's hard getting used to how clear this tv is. You have to learn the tv and utilize the filters for movies and sitcoms. The picture is so clear it distracts from the fact that movies are suppose to be fake. However that being said you do get used to it and there is no better tv available for sports, you are there! Also any production designed for super high def is beautiful. And the Black on this tv is perfect. It's not dark grey like most TVs it's truly black! Like I said AWESOME TV!", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Value", "Author": "AMG-PFD", "ReviewID": "R3EPCLLBKROAWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those like me , this is the best picture for a bright room , wanting to watch sports and movies. without 3D glasses,this is tv for you.

Deep blacks, vivid colors, and no ghosting.  I upgraded from a 63\" plasma, so picture quality was very important to me.  It takes a little bit of effort to get the picture to look \"right\", but once you do it's great.  At first the Soap Opera Effect was a bit jarring so I disabled the features that causes it.  But - I ended up enabling them again and have gotten used to it.  In my opinion it makes everything stand out more and it feels like you're getting more out of the TV.  Again - that's my personal opinion... to each their own.Now - the reason for 4 stars and not 5 is this:  The menus/setup on this TV is really confusing.  It took me 10 minutes just to figure out how to turn off the built-in speakers and output sound to my AV receiver.  Sharp could have done a MUCH better job designing the UI and making it more intuitive.  My second gripe is minor for me, but may cause others some problems depending on their setup.  The power cord is NOT removable.  That to me is just silly for a high end TV.Hope this helps!", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "A GREAT TV, AND THE TIMING WAS PERFECT TO ORDER", "Author": "R. J. Nodes", "ReviewID": "R32LPQSL60A8I1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very satisfied with my purchase of the 70\" Sharp Aquos - start to finish. I had watched the price fluctuations, as I'm sure many Amazon purchasers do, and felt that it had reached its low in early December and was time to buy. First, the TV itself: it is everything that the manufacturer promised and more. The setup was fairly simple (I have to confess that year's ago, I sold high end TV's) and its performance is fantastic. My sole concern was in hoping I wouldn't find a lot of dead pixels, and there has not been a single one! The delivery truck arrived when they said it would, and two men brought it in (it's very heavy). Although the driver said that they \"weren't supposed to 'set it up\", they did a good job of putting the stand on and picking it up and putting it on the stand. (did I mention that it's heavy?) The price did increase within two days of my ordering it.I recommend this TV very highly if you're looking for a really big screen and a quality product. By the way, I was not interested in the 3-D model.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "great tv and a good buy", "Author": "SETH MCCORMICK", "ReviewID": "RW5YBXAIB3EP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was sure about buying a recondition but it's GREAT can't tell from a brand new one!! wish I could buy another one", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWSOME TV 240HZ WOW What a Difference BUT POOR AMAZON DELIVERY", "Author": "ski", "ReviewID": "R1WE6DUXZKIK0H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "TV is fantastic however AMAZON dropped the ball on delivery. CEVA was awful, showed up 2hrs late, dropped the tv and ran.

Luckily the tv worked and im in HDTV bliss don't listen to the folks that say 120hz is sufficient. If your ok with super Nintendo movement get a 120hz, but with 240hz football has never looked better.
