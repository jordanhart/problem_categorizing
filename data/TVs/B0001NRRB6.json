{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good quality display, best in darker rooms, no HDMI", "Author": "Michael L. Koch", "ReviewID": "R39V5FVQM9DUME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about 8 years, and only replaced the bulb once (and I watch a LOT of TV). The biggest things to beware of are, as with most projection TVs, it works best in darker rooms since the display is not that bright and can appear washed out in brightly lit rooms. The quality of the HD picture is very good, and very sharp. Also, the only true HD output is via the DVI connector - there is no HDMI output, so this TV will not work with some modern peripherals such as many blue-ray players, Playstation 3, AppleTV, etc., which require the HDCP connection that is only available via HDMI. The interface software is based on Windows CE and is a bit clunky, but not too hard to figure out. The whole thing only weighs about 100 pounds, so it's not difficult to move, just awkward if you're trying to handle it yourself. There's an ethernet port on the back, and RCA also made a wireless keyboard that you could use with the built-in web browser to surf the web right on your screen. If you can find one in good working condition for a couple hundred dollars and don't need HDMI output, this is a good unit.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good picture for the money", "Author": "C. Tuss \"game lover\"", "ReviewID": "R3P1YG2YJX41OK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV used a few years ago for cheap b/c it was loud (had a bad bearing in the color wheel.) I replaced the color wheel myself, easy to do, for around $100 for an upgraded part with better bearing design, and the TV has run flawlessly since.  I'm still using the same bulb that came with the TV, but I run the lamp setting on Low, which isn't much of a difference from bright. Another reason I use the low lamp setting is b/c the lamps run very hot and high heat is the enemy of electronics, the lamp will run significantly cooler on the lower setting which will decrease the potential for other electronic component issues. I have this thing on all the time as I use it for watching HDTV via Comcast cable with set top box, watching movies on Blue Ray player and gaming on Xbox 360.  Something to note is this TV does not accept 720p signal.  This could be a problem with a couple channels if getting HD reception through Antenna or Sat, but cable all comes through at 1080i in my area, so not an issue for me.  Also most high def devices such as gaming systems and Blue Ray players allow the user to select which HD signal to use.  I have both my Xbox 360 and Blue Ray set at 1080i, and the TV works great for all my needs. Picture quality isn't far off a new Mitsubishi 1080p DLP I had for a few days.  I bought the Mitsu to upgrade, but it was louder in operation and not much of a difference in picture quality, so I returned it and am keeping this one till it dies; or the newer technologies eventually become rediculously cheap.  The design is a bit dated, so it's kind of a sleeper; It always surprises people when the TV is off and I click it on and they see how good of a picture this dated looking beast puts out.  These old DLPs have kind of a bad rep from bulbs burning out etc. but a lot of these are probably attributed to people getting the cheap knock offs, not the genuine Phillips bulbs which are rated for 6000-10000 hours, and possibly beyond using the low lamp setting.  Overall, this TV puts out great picture, is very inexpensive and has proven reliable for my use.  If you are on a budget but still want a large TV with great picture it's a good deal.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "RCA stands for Realy crappy apliance", "Author": "Zachary Ford \"Zachary Ford\"", "ReviewID": "R3QTF1KJQ4O8AP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tv is basically only for watching movies if you want to play games as i was hoping to do most of them are native 720p display. This is a big problem for this TV because it does not support 720p this sounds stupid and was odd to me because the tv supports 1080i perfectly. The tv is also very loud and the bulbs are unreliable I have had it for a week and I am already looking for a new tv. I would recommend spending a little extra on a samsung or sony model.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "RCA 61\" Widescreen DLP(TM) HDTV with Integrated ATSC & QAM Tuner (HD61LPW42)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SNEDGMWBL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0001NRRB6"}}
