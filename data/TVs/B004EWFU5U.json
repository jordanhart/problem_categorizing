It is a very easy set up. Just plug it in and it guides you through the steps and then plug in all your cables and you will be watching t.v. in no time. Picture quality is great for the price. However I did notice some slight lag during fast motion sequences while the t.v. is still warming up. It does go away once it is warmed up. I find the sound to be very good. Its no bose surround sound system by any means but for a $700 price tag it sounds really good whether its a dvd, video game, t.v. etc. It has a great slim and sleek look to it and looks great sitting on my tv stand. The vizio internet apps are without a doubt first generation style apps. Definitely not on par with app's you will find on smart phones. Even so, still cool that I can check my facebook page with the t.v. remote while still watching t.v. Looking forward to future applications and better designed applications though I do understand that this is not a computer.Overall I am very happy with the purchaseEdit 1/21/11. Image lag still affecting picture. Seems to happen during scenes that have bright background. Highly noticeable when  people move across the screen or camera view moves across scenery. Looks like a trail of enlarged and jumbled pixels that follow objects during movement of object or camera movement across object.  I heard through the grapevine that this is a known problem with vizios but have yet to call the company to confirm. When I do I will edit this review with the feedback. I would lower my ratingto a 3.4 for this product.Edit 2/09/11. The t.v. Is  presenting even more issues now. Twice within about 20 total hours of t.v. Viewing, the t.v. Shuts itself off and performs a power cycle. Power cycles are basically the equivalent of restarting your computer when a problem arises. I've contacted vizio and they had me tweak some settings. Obviously those tweaks did nothing. I am going to call them back and hopefully they take the thing back.Also, image lag as I described in earlier edit still exists. Hasn't gotten any better or worse but definitely not gone away. Went to the store where I bought the t.v. And watched the m421vt display model. I noticed the same lag on that t.v. That appears on mine, which would lead me to believe that this is not just a problem with my particular tv but a problem with the entire line of m421vt's.I would now rate this tv a 2 out of 5 and I'm going to say that this thing is a lemon. Avoid purchase of this product and keep saving enough until you can get a higher quality tv.Edit 7/23/11. About 3 months ago vizio took the problematic tv back and sent me a \"new one\" still have the same problem as the old one but no where near as frequent. Be sure and send in your warranty cards when purchasing the tv.  !!", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "have to learn this tv to make it great", "Author": "critique10304", "ReviewID": "R1FY1JZRRY7FDI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok, first things first.  I want to address the issue with this tv turning off automatically...If you turn off the adaptive luma, smart dimming, and ambient lighting...no probelems, but it seems like features you pay for that you aren't using.  Next, I believe the factory presets are just trash, so I bought a calibration disc from Disney called WOW which is very comprehensive.  After calibration the tv is awesome.  Here are the settings with a dimly lit room...Picture Mode = Movie  Backlight = 40  Brightness = 39  Contrast = 52  Color = 47  Tint = -5  Sharpness = 16  Color Temperature = All 128  Smooth Motion effect = off  Real Cinema Mode = Precision  Noise Reduction = High  Color Enhancement = Normal  Adaptive Luma = Off  Film Mode = Auto  Smart dimming = off  Ambient light sensor = offKeep in mind, these are optimal settings for a ps3 blu-ray player, so settings can vary...if too bright just drop the backlight level.  It was a lot of work getting the settings just right, which is why I only give it a 4...Hope this helps people who are looking to buy and for those who have already bought and were not happy with the results.

I was torn between this and a Sony Bravia 40\", but feel I have made the right choice.  I had my doubts as it didn't have a lot of reviews and one noted some issues that seemed somewhat bothersome.  I haven't noticed any of these issues luckily.Upgrading from a much older LCD to a new LED back-lit LCD obviously has improvements.  As I just got this TV a few days ago, I haven't been able to fully test out the 1080p resolution, but the difference is easily noticeable between the TVs running cable at 720p/1080i.  From what I did try in 1080p looked far improved.The Apps work well aside from netflix freezing once and forcing the TV to restart, but I use it a lot and rarely have any problems.  I don't have much to compare it to as this is the only TV I've used that has any applications, but it is more than enough for me.  There is still room for improvement, but as it upgraded the firmware the first day I had it, I feel it shouldn't have any problems advancing.Overall a great product.  Fair priced and good performance.  I feel most people won't regret this purchase, but suggest seeing the TVs in action to pick what's right for them.I will edit this review if there are any problems.UPDATEThis TV does \"reset\" quite often.  And also there is an issue with the smart dimming.  If there is a screen with a lot of black for an extended period of time (for me it was GTAIV's pause screen) it will shut off the screen.  Luckily all you have to do is turn off smart dimming.  As for the constant resets, I am currently looking into it.  Dropped to 4 stars.  The resets are tolerable, just annoying.UPDATE 2The resets no longer seem to be occurring.  It might have been fixed, I'll update again if it seems to start happening again.  But for now back up to 5 stars.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "TV goes blank - known firmware issue that remains uncorrected", "Author": "RCSails", "ReviewID": "R2AYGZ1UYV2N2Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "VIZIO M421VT 42-Inch 120 Hz Class Edge Lit Razor LED LCD HDTV with VIZIO Internet Apps, BlackThis TV goes blank for about one minute periodically without warning.

It's been a year and a half and, knock on wood, the only downside has been the \"power cycling,\" that occurs about once every 3-6 months for no apparent reason.  I guess that's good news since I never filled out my Warranty card...but at this point I'd be out of warranty anyway.  The last time it happened I Googled it and ran across these reviews or else I never would have known what was happening.  They don't mention it in the trouble shooting guide, and I think they should. It's slightly annoying and I wish it didn't happen but that's been my only major issue.  Oh wait, I forgot, I had a hell of a time setting up the Netflix app on my TV.  Not a big deal because I decided that app is crap anyway so I never subscribed.I was afraid I'd never use the apps but I sometimes do use Pandora and use to use Hulu (until they stopped carrying 30 Rock, then it was no longer worth it!).I did notice the slight picture lag others have mentioned but I had a friend help me play with the settings and I haven't had an issue since.My guess is that people who like this TV never bother to post comments since it appears that there are a lot of negative reviews on this TV and I haven't had any major issues.

Panzanella", "ReviewID": "R2O34GGUAQL8JT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Used only 2-3 hours per week in a bedroom setup.  Slow to startup.  Internet apps only OK since they are slow.  Picture quality is pretty good, but the grainy with an SD picture.  Picture averaging improves this but results in an unnatural video.  Illuminated Vizio logo stinks in low light environments (like a bedroom).  I have to cover it up since it's way brighter than a night light.  Can't find a way to turn it off either.Biggest issue... wife turned the unit on then immediately off on accident.  Then it went into its blinking state of death.  i.e. the Vizio logo flashes after plugin.  Power button does nothing.  Vizio claims their failure rates are low, but the net has many people complaining about this failure mode.  People also say it's about $200-$300 to have diagnosed and fixed.  Joy.I bought a motherboard off Ebay for $73.  Hopefully this will fix it.  I have many other non-Vizio LCD TV's that get way more usage and have not had an issue.

The customer service rep plainly told me TO JUST THROW THE TV OUT AND BUY A NEW ONE.Bottom line: Vizio products are not reliable and not repairable. I will never buy anything from them again.

It makes everything look a little less life like. It's hard to explain, but everything looks a little bit fake.

Being able to stream Pandora on there is very awesome. I have not watched a Blu-Ray on this set yet but I'm sure it will be good considering I watched 300 (on Comcast Xfinity again connected w/ an HDMI) and it was absolutely spectacular.I was skeptical at first because I debated spending a higher amount for a Samsung or Sony and didn't know much about Vizio and after this experience I am very pleased and am very likely to buy a Vizio again in the future.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vizio 421VT 42 in.
