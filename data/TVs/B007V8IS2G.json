MY first plasma and it does not compare well against my old LCD. there are no whites...only shades of gray.  I've tried all the adjustments/tuning but it still does not have bright colors.  The anti-glare feature works well.  Maybe that feature dulls the color?UPDATE:  After multiple 1 hour calls to LG and following their tuning instructions they agreed to send a tech out.  I showed him my 7 year old Sony and compared it to the new LG illustrating the dull picture of the LG.  After he made multiple adjustments he said \"that's the way it is\".  I wouldn't give you $100 for this LG TV.Another piece of advice:  Don't buy your TV until your ready to mount it.  Not thinking there could be anything wrong with this TV, my installation was delayed past 30 days of my receipt of it so I could not send it back.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kick a** TV period.", "Author": "R.
