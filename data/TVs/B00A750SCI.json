It is obvious that the unit was not handled with care.  Also, the sound quality is mediocre.  Luckily, I hook it up to my Logitech Speaker System Z623.On the bright side this TV came in the mail on time and has stood up to most of my expectations.  It has a bright LED display, 1 USB port, 3 HDMI ports, and a remote control.  I like the picture quality, and it easy to customize to personal preferences.  I mainly use this TV for watching HD movies and playing my XBOX 360 in 1080p.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Junk at any price: An insult to the Honeywell name.", "Author": "Renaissance Man \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R1FLA6QNM9LNX8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Other reviewers have commented about the sound quality and dead pixels on the screen right out of the box.  While I paid a discounted $149 just a couple of days before other purchasers were buying for $107, perhaps it's not surprising that Amazon no longer has the item in stock -- they were probably trying to quickly unload whatever inventory they had!Dead pixels (white dots on a black screen or black dots on a white screen) are caused by a defective or worn out DLP chip in the product.  Could Sonitronix Corporation be deliberately purchasing seconds or factory imperfect chips for this Avanza product line and rely upon their purchasing a license to use the premium Honeywell brand name to promote a third rate product?  The condition of pixels remaining stuck in a permanent on or off condition can and does occur after long term use (usually thousands of hours) and gradually continues to worsen once it has started.  Premium manufacturers such as Mitsubishi, Samsung and others typically provide a warranty repair or replacement of their units if two or more dead pixels occur at any time during the two-year warranty period and, by so doing, appear to be creating a voluntary industry standard.  Acer, on the other hand, has had significant problems with their flat screen computer monitors.As for the tinny sound quality, an insult to the ears might be a better description, sounding to me something like a screeching chimpanzee and a squawking parrot playing volleyball with a tin can full of rusty nails, nuts and bolts.  Honeywell Avanza offers the Honeywell Soundbar through their product manual (a minimum essential for most any flat screen television for tolerable listening) that would connect through the RCA outlet sockets on the unit side panel.  For even better audio quality one should be able to connect via the same outlet sockets to any other separate, quality speakers or sound system -- but not with this piece of junk.  The RCA outlets are totally inactive, not connected, whatever.I have been in communication with the Honeywell Consumer Electronics network (Sonitronix Corp.) by telephone for over two weeks, trying to politely reason with them but to no avail.  After all, nobody expects every item from a production line to be perfect.  After the obligatory time on hold for the next available representative, one always connects with the same person.  Perhaps there is only one person?  She's very polite and appears to be understanding but seems to have no authority to deal with problems.  Initially it was \"I sympathize with your concerns but I'll have to refer the matter to my manager, Ryan, and then get back to you\".  The following week it was \"Ryan is no longer with the company.  I'll refer your situation to Aaron, who has taken over Ryan's caseload, and hopefully we can get back to you by the end of the week.\"True to her word, Misty did call and leave a voicemail on Friday afternoon, but the news was not good and calls into question the integrity of this pseudo-Honeywell/Sonitronix/Avanza entity.  Basically, the Honeywell Soundbar for attachment to the flat screen unit is a myth, a fabrication, a product of wishful thinking for some indeterminate future point in time.  No comment as to why the audio outlets do not work.  Moreover, Sonitronix denies all responsibility for pixel defects at any time, either when the product is brand new or at any future time during the \"warranty\" (joke?) period.  Would anyone accept a new computer with 4Gb Memory that only yields 3.77Gb, for example, or a 3.2GHz CPU that only performs at 2.93GHz?Bottom line, whatever one has been foolish enough to have purchased, they are stuck with as far as Sonitronix is concerned.  Kudos to Amazon, however, who have agreed to take this defective product back and issue a full refund.  I am currently awaiting the promised RMA by e-mail in order to send the product back.  My main regret is the huge amount of time wasted in trying to resolve the issue.  I hope this review provides a \"buyer beware\" warning to other potential purchasers and wish that Amazon would accept the \"Zero Stars\" rating that is deserved, in my opinion, rather than the forced single star.  I wonder whether Misty still has a job and for how long Sonitronics will remain in business.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "G.

It works perfectly, no dead pixels.  It's a 24\" LED HDTV with  Full 1080P HD.  The sound is of decent quality, too.  This HDTV has 3 HDMI inputs, which is not as common on the smaller size HDTVs allowing for hookup of a game system, a blu-ray player and a Roku box without another device.This Honeywell HDTV was shipped to us as replacement for a different HDTV that developed a dead pixel line shortly after arrival. The warranty provider on the other HDTV explained all these HDTVs are sensitive to minor damage in shipping and can develop the pixel issue in the first few months of service due to the bumping during shipping.  We found it was very easy to contact the manufacturer and get a replacement unit shipped out. Kudos for great customer service!

When I opened the box, the bolts to attach the TV to the base was missing.  I tried calling \"Sonitronix\" at the 888 number listed in the warranty information, for five days, and waited until they hung up on me.  I then tried to leave a \"priority\" call back message, which was never returned and their website doesn't exist.  I think Sonitronix must be a scam company in Chino California.  I finally propped up the TV and it seems to work fine, except the speaker is horrible.  I have e-mailed Honeywell, Sonitronix, Tiger products, and finally Big Lots, and all have told me to call the fictitious Sonitronix.

The only 24\" I could find with more than 1 HDMI port, it has 3, and all the ports you would find on the more expensive models.I read in the other reviews it had bad sound, and it is kind of dull sounding. The TV I switched from was 10 years old and had a more full sound. So I bought some $10 logitek USB Speakers and it sounds very nice now.SUPER SAVINGS?I had a large order, and they separated most things, and shipped them quickly, except for this TV and a Toshiba laptop I ordered... they took a full 2 weeks just to ship it... and when I got it, it was a large Amazon.com box that looked like hell, was falling apart, ripped, smashed corners, almost falling open. Opening it revealed the TV box, and the very much more smaller box my laptop was in, threwn in on top of the TV box, with no cushioning whatsoever, not even paper, or peanuts. The Toshiba box corners were all smashed as it had obviously been sliding around inside the giant Amazon.com box, on top the TV box...I can't understand for the life of me why they would ship these two items together the way they did. I almost returned the laptop for fear it might have been damaged on shipping, but talked to a customer service and they said I could try it for 30 days and if I felt it had been damaged they would exchange or refund, and so far, it's been ok.
