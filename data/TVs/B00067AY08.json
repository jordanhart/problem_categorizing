I've connected an HDTV cable box via HDMI, progressive DVD player via component input and TIVO through S-video.  So far the TV has performed extremely well, no problems to report.  I've also been very impressed with the sound this TV produces.  It's so good that I don't normally bother to run normal TV through my AV receiver.Standard definition looks better than I expected for both straight cable broadcasts and through the TIVO recorded on medium quality.  DVD look very good, but the true HDTV sources really shine with this TV - the Olympics were amazing!The display is bright enough that I actually watch it with the bulb in \"reduced\" mode (even in the day) to extend the bulb life.I've had no problems, and as suggested for anything projection systems I've got the TV hooked up to a UPS in case of power failure, and I did spring for an extended warrantee with bulb replacement.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "5 YEARS AND GOING STRONG", "Author": "El Gran Jaibo \"Jaibo\"", "ReviewID": "REJ32TNFD28E2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Sony KDF55E Projection LCD TV in 2006 and have no complaints. It is viewable from anywhere in the room. It's about 12\" deep and not a flat panel TV but it is a flat screen TV. When I play certain HD programming, you can sure tell the difference in resolution. It's really quite amazing how beautiful a National Geographic Special program can be in true High Defenition. I love it! And of course the Sony surroundsound system I got at the same time adds to the experience. Note that I have a nice, smaller TV in my bedroom that's hooked up to my laptop computer and a DVD player and my Klipsch Pro-Media 2.1 speakers(awesome). I don't watch the big Sony TV that much so it's got low miles. I mention that because in August of 2010 I got the first message on screen when I turned it on that the bulb was nearing it's life expectancy and should be replaced. It's been over a year and I still get the message every time I turn it on, but the picture is perfect and I'm waiting for a sign that it's really about to go out. I hear it's about $200-$250 for the new bulb. Overall I'm very happy with the TV set. But next time I probably won't go quite so big. UPDATE: July of 2013 the bulb has finally burnt out almost three years after that message started showing up every time I turned the TV on. I'll report again after I replace it and use it for awhile.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "blue blob and stars", "Author": "JO FROM NJ \"JO\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZFIVY8AJZRF7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought this tv in 20078 months ago started seeing a very small blue blob in bottom right of screen. THis has now grown to cover 25% of screen .ALso there are thousands of blue dots on screen. after sony wsa sued with a class action suit (i wasnt party to this) they extended the warranty until last year. I contacted them and they told me there was nothing they can do. Its a optical block defect.DONT BUY IT", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Display Problem", "Author": "Mark Seiwert", "ReviewID": "R3QF58LEQHE4N9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My Sony LCD large screen TV is just over one year old.  It has yellow splotch about mid upper screen. A close inspection of the screen reveals a circuit board trace like pattern that is yellow. The set has not been abused or exposed to temperature extremes. A UPS should be used with these units to keep the lamp cooling fan powered in case of a power failure.  The lamps are at least $250.00 I would definitely recomend the extended warranty. Is the technology not proven on these large screens? Is the screen going to fail after 3 years when the extended warranty is expired? Sony will not stand behind their product after the warrany is expired. (mine is two weeks out) Other than the display problem the unit has performed flawless. It's a lot of money for a TV that doesn't last more than a year!!!!", "Date": "December 1, 2004"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Vivid, high-definition, slim-chassis LCD projection television with 55-inch screen and ATSC (HDTV) tuner; 62 x 37.5 x 19 inches (W x H x D)\nLightweight design with bright, high-contrast screen; CableCARD compatibility removes the need for a separate digital cable box\n3.28 million dots resolution for stunning detail and clarity; fixed-pixel display and constant light prevent image flicker\nLive Color emphasizes blues and greens without affecting reds for a more natural, vivid picture\n5 watts per channel x 2 stereo sound and built-in 20-watt subwoofer for rich, lifelike sound; Dolby Virtual Surround simulates surround sound", "Name": "Sony KDF-55XS955 55-Inch HD-Ready LCD Projection Television", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B1M2Y1DCL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00067AY08"}}
