For the first week of use the text was very blurry on the monitor and it was only through reading on message boards that I found this option needed to be changed.  It is not an obvious option as I had been through the whole menu on the TV many times.  Once this option is set Windows looks great at 1080p.I also have xbox 360 hooked up to the second hdmi port and that looks great as well.Overall this is a very nice TV or monitor for 250 bucks if you are going to be sitting pretty close to it when using it.One other negative might be the stand as it doesn't really allow you to do anything.

Bailey \"Snookums\"", "ReviewID": "RK9W4FPANT3N4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK....so here I was looking for a bedroom TV to hook up to my bluray and Netflix streaming. Finally gotten rid of the old clunker Haier tube TV from years ago.At first, I was taken by the design of a Vizio 26\" somewhat widely carried by many retailers and also on the internet. So I went out and bought it at a local retailer. Psyched. It fit perfectly in the intended bedroom spot. Looked great too. Dead remote....couldn't get past the first set-up page. Tried everything. Very pissed off. A bad omen. Such disappointment. Returned it for a refund.Then.....I discovered this Samsung. Always liked Samsung. Even though the size was a bit smaller and it looked like everybody else's flat screen, I found that it is 1080p with a 120khz refresh rate. Granted the 1080p res isn't anything to write home about with such a small screen, the 120hz refresh rate (better pic with fast motion) hooked me along with the LED illumination. Bought it. Set it up. Hey! It works!! Fantastic picture.Pros: Samsung - 120hz refresh rate - sturdy remote control - slim design - excellent picture.Cons: NONE really. But....there is no audio output on this particular model. You must rely soley on the set's speakers. Some people have complained of this, but they should have inquired first before buying. Some complain of the audio quality, but...if you go into the settings and work with the set's audio equalizer a bit you can get it to sound quite nice for a set of it's size.  Remember, this is a small set intended for the kitchen, bedroom, dorm or study. Not a home theatre. Part of this could be worked around if you have a bluray with audio outputs.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "With a PS3", "Author": "Tinker", "ReviewID": "R3FOAP0VEJW6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is used exclusively with The Boss' PS3 console, and it's a very nice screen.  Coincidentally, the day this was delivered, she brought home a similarly-priced, identically-spec'd 24-inch Toshiba from a local B&M;, and the differences are night-and-day.Both have a stunning picture, head-on, but as you move off-axis from directly in front of the screen, this Samsung holds color gamut at far greater angles than the Toshiba, and remains viewable at least as far to the side as you can go and still see the screen.  Colors may not be so great at that angle, but you can see them.  With the Toshiba, all you see is a dark panel.We previously had a Sony Trinitron CRT connected to the PS3 console, and I thought it worked mighty good at that role.  I'm not a gamer, but when I look over her shoulder now, I can see parts of the games I've never seen before, and not because of the wider aspect ratio.  Stuff that was hidden in the dark areas now pops out.This is the first LCD television I bought, and I bought small and cheap because of the problems inherent with LCD screens.  This one has sold me.  Still have to be careful with brands and models within brands, but I like 'em and am actively shopping for a larger screen for the living room.As a bonus, The Boss says the games look so much better - and different - she can go back and play her old games all over again.  If she does that, this set will have paid for itself in a few months.Highly recommend this where it's size fits the size of the room.

Universally, including Amazon's own definition, you can expect an Ethernet port, and usually some means to connect via wi-fi, either built in or by adding an adapter.My first hint of trouble was the lack of an Ethernet port.  The next hint was the absence of any mention of networking in the manual.  I connected a Samsung wi-fi adapter (one that based on the supplied chart should be the correct model). No dice.  I have another Samsung HD TV that does work in this manner, so I'm familiar with the procedure and have the online Samsung documentation for connecting a 5000 series unit to back my efforts. It simply did not provide any network configuration options.I contacted Samsung tech support next. At first the tech said it should have worked, but when I insisted it didn't he went away for an extended period to look further. When he returned, he apologized but stated this TV can not be connected to a network.And that's it.  It is advertised as being \" Internet ready\" when it in fact is not.

Most stations (even digital ones) still broadcast many programs and movies in 480p and non HD DVDs are in 720p.It has a \"simulated\" 120 Mhz refresh rate to reduce blurring during fast motion, such as sports events, action videos, etc.  Samsung calls this \"Clear Motion Rate 120\"It has 2 hdmi & 1 usb port/s.It can double as a PC monitor and is very clear for either reading or gaming.It has a thin profile and is lightweight for wall mounting.It has several adjustments allowing one to get the most out of the tiny back facing stereo speakers.CONS:As has has been said, the screw-in base is somewhat feeble and unstable, and leaves one with an  insecure feeling.It does not have true but rather a simulated 120 mhz refresh rate, \"Clear Motion Rate 120\" for fast moving images.As with most TV's I've found the internal sound quality to be inherently inadequate.It lacks an external headphone/speaker port.The killer con for me (worth 2 out of 5 stars) was No external headphone/speaker jack. This did not allow me the option of plugging in my superior external speaker system or my headphones when I needed to keep the noise level down and not disturb anyone.This was the first time that I purchased any TV that lacked this option and I was truely surprized that anyone, especially Samsung, would create an otherwise outstanding TV and not provide an external headphone jack.Samsung customer service verified that there was NO work around to hook up my external headphone or speaker system on this unit, so I sadly had to return it.I was told that the samsung hdtv model un22d5010 might have an external headphone jack, but I have not been able to confirm this with an actual owner or technical person.The model un22d5010 does appear to be identical to the un22d5003bf in every other way, so it may be the better TV for me if I can confirm that it actually has an external headphone/speaker jack.For persons who are satisfied with the intrinsic speaker sound of most TVs, and forsee no need for external headphone use, then the Samsung model un22d5003bf is an otherwise very good, albeit somewhat expensive (due to the newness of LED technology) HDTV.For the rest of us, make no assumption that a new TV will come with an external headphone option that we once thought was ubiquitous.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Impressive TV/Monitor So Far", "Author": "Tom Lawson", "ReviewID": "R1A4LVJXMGZTOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV to replace a 17 year old 13\" Magnavox and a 10 year old ViewSonic Monitor, so far so good. It doesn't have many inputs and the Component and A/V inputs are shared (meaning you can't have both plugged in at once, or if you can I haven't figured out how yet). The picture quality really is excellent, especially as a widescreen monitor. I have an older PC system and am running it through the TV via a DVI-HDMI cable. There is no VGA input on this TV, which I was expecting (because I didn't read the specs carefully enough). The picture quality is also excellent as a TV; I have a VCR and DVD player connected to it as well as some gaming systems and they all look great. I can't comment too much on the sound as I have all my electronics hooked up to my stereo receiver. It should be noted however that this TV has no audio out so you can't hook up headphones or external speakers directly to it. For it's size and probable use though, the audio sounds good. It was easy to set up, with all the controls being pretty intuitive. My only real problem with the TV would be the stand. It seems stable enough and I have no fear that it will tip over or break, but it's non-adjustable. This isn't too big a problem as the TV has a pretty wide viewing angle, but it still seems like it should have some adjustments on it. Overall I'm very satisfied with the TV so far, though I've only had it a few days.  Will it last as long as my Magnavox? Odds are it won't, especially as I'm using it as a dual purpose unit, but for however long it lasts, I think it'll be a good little TV.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "22\" Samsung HDTV", "Author": "Don Finch", "ReviewID": "R1BDTGLCFU1435", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I  bought four of these to place in guest bedrooms and the kitchen.

The TV I am replacing is an amazing Samsung LN19A650. The minute I plugged this in I found the color of the picture absolutely atrocious. I called samsung and we went through changing some of the settings around, spent 2 weeks trying to make it work, I even bought the Disney \"World of Wonder\" TV calibration DVD to get the best settings, nothing doing.The color is not *always* horrid, but in most scenes it's almost as if they just make up colors. Oh look, red, lets make this bright perfect primary, oh, that's grass, let's make it bright as can be, all oceans must be intense blue, oh, khaki, who needs it. That would be not horrible but my goodness, faces come off super peachy or really tan and monochromatic, often jaundiced. faces of brown or olive people can be very washed out, it's really awful. So i went to best buy to check out the TV's on display just to make sure i didn't have a wonky set, the tv's there were the same. Again, most scenes were perfect but too many exhibited the same problems i was having with the one i had bought, washed out neutrals and exaggerated greens and blues and unnatural skin tones. I tried all of the pre-set settings as well as custom settings. Movie mode was the most normal but still too many scenes exhibited poor color interpretations. I then bought the 22\" LG led tv (LV2500) and in comparison the Samsung picture was so much crisper with no background picture noise but the colors were so much more reliable and consistently appropriate on the LG.[EDIT} In the end the best setting for me ended up being turning all the colors way way down. Now the colors are better some faces end up a little off color sometimes, but for the most part it's pretty good now.Everything else about the samsung is just fine.OUTPUT/INPUTS: Yes, there are limited output/inputs, if you want more options than the 5003, the samsung un22d5000 is the EXACT same TV except with more input/output options. I bought the TV very aware of that but having more speaker volume was important to me and the 5003 has a total of 10Watts whereas the 5000 has a total of 6Watts, no idea if that actually makes a difference.MOTION RATE/REFRESH RATE: Regarding the 120hz drama, it's a little confusing for them to have marketed this TV like that but anyone who is buying it for the 120hz should know enough that refresh rate is never described as clear motion rate and they could have figured it out before buying the tv. For TV watchers 60hz vs. 120 on a tv this size won't make a difference, not to mention there is no other TV with a 120hz under 32\". No idea on what that means for gamers, there's a discussion on amazon about this, consensus seems to be that 120hz is not better than 60hz.SOUND: Yeah, not so hot. In some circumstances the \"surround sound\" set to on it much better, usually movies. Unfortunately it isn't so good for television shows.VIEWING ANGLE is poor, but dealable, just gotta make sure to sit eye level to the TV.The colors were almost a dealbreaker for me, thankfully I was able to find a setting that worked, quite happy with my tv now.

What I got was a tv that went from my pc, to my bedroom and back to the store.  The color was way off and no control settings would fix it.  After spending hours on the phone with Samsung, they suggested I hire a home calibration service from Best Buy or the like.  First of all, the calibration service would cost more than the TV did so that was a non-starter.  Secondly, I've been in the computer support business for ... scary thought... over 20 years, so I know how to calibrate a monitor/tv so I'm not going to pay someone for something I do myself all the time.  Samsung's support said they would take it in for service and they would be sending a shipping label via email.  After a two day wait, I decided to return it to the store instead.

It couldn't be easier.The TV is hooked up to an AppleTV so now I have unlimited Netflix streaming and iTunes access.  I wish the tv was a little bigger but if it were bigger, it wouldn't fit in my RV when I go on trips which is the reason I went with this size anyway.

In addition, note that in the 2011 model UN22D5000, it is the VERSION AY02 that is the SUPERIOR MODEL, compared with the older VERSION AY01. I had both. Samsung in general no longer makes high quality models in the 2012 \"E\" series, unless it is in the very high-end ones (in prices). You may still find some Amazon Marketplace sellers selling mostly used 2011 model (UN22D5000) but on rare occasion brand new - even though listed under used (check description for each seller), and be sure to ask about which version: AY01 or AY02. AY02 is vastly superior to AY01, like a different or newer TV. I can't explain the difference. My eyes tell me so and so would yours. When I first turned my AY02 model on, my heart skipped a beat - \"Wow!\" \"I am in love.\" AY01 the older model is OK, but nothing that causes my heart to jump out of my chest or go into fibrillation.

I am utterly disappointed with my recent purchase, the UN22D5003 BFXZA Samsung  LED TV. I currently also have an 18 month old Samsung  40\u201d LCD TV that I absolutely LOVE.  The color & picture clarity are spot on \u2013 I\u2019ve even had people remark to me how great my picture is.  This is why it was a no brainer when it came time to purchase a second TV.When I first received the UN22D TV, the color was OFF \u2013 overly saturated with yellows & purples, but not consistently, and not on every channel.  I was on the phone with Samsung\u2019s customer service multiple times, and even with tweaking different settings, nothing helped.  At this point, being a Samsung brand, I was sure I had received a rare  \u2018lemon\u2019, and returned the original to the retailer for a new UN22D.  To my utter surprise & disappointment, the replaced TV was no different than the 1st.Now I\u2019m back on the phone with Samsung, and they\u2019re telling me I need service.

In regards to the first issue , if you are using a pc or 360/ps3 the headphones or speakers would utilize the audio in jacks since the audio source would be either the pc or 360/ps3.The only time you cannot use headphones or speakers is when you watching broadcast television or cable.That being said how hard could it have been to add the audio out option?In regards to use as a pc monitor I have read a few reviews stating that they could not get the colors or resolution right when using HDMI to hook up to a PC, I had the same problem at first but the solution was simple. You have to rename the connection to pc if using a HDMI cable or PC/DVI if using a DVI adapter by pressing first the source button then the tools button and then edit name. You will see a list of options then select PC. After I did that the screen looked great. These directions are in the manual but I was screwing around with color and contrast options for 2 hours before I decided to take a look.

Still, the product description is misleading, and you may be able to find a better value by searching for plain old 60Hz televisions.Edit: Other reviewers have noted that the processor can enable 120-hz refresh, but after reviewing the information on Samsung's website, I am not convinced that this TV is capable of producing the two distinct images per 60hz cycle that would be necessary for active shutter 3D glasses.

For one, the red tint on the display is very overpowered for some reason and I had to lower it in order to get a semblance of normal white. Then the display is not pixel-perfect. The display oddly blurs and sharpens things, so as to make TV/games look better and smoother, and to be honest, they do look better. However, on a PC desktop, this means you can't just have a normal pixel and a sharp font. Words are either blurry or have the nasty artifacts that come with the \"sharpness\" setting and there is no way to just make it display 1920x1080 normally without filtering it heavily, making it no good for a monitor outside of playing games.Other than that, it has great colors and a fantastic black level, and lots of great options to adjust the image. But I'm upset about the 120 thing being meaningless and it being no good as a monitor.

Then with the money you save, go buy a Roku 2 XS and sign up for Netflix or Amazon Instant Video for a low fee.The only flaw with this device is that there is no Audio Out ports.

The TV looks great, set up was incredibly easy, and its less that 2 inches thick, so it doesn't waste any space. Also, the differences between this and the 2012 model seemed minimal to me, especially in aesthetic appearance and how the back is set up. My only gripe is that the base is not as sturdy as other TV bases I've come across. However, it also does not swivel, and the base is perfectly fine when it's just sitting there.

It has allowed us to preserve the dvd while still allowing my son to watch his movies.If i had a quarrel with this TV it would be the backlight. It isnt noticeable when you have an input running (TV, Game), but when it is a black screen, you can see the white lights behind. A very nit picky observation, but not enough for me to drop it to 4 stars. Great TV that offers a lot of versatility.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Price", "Author": "Kevin R.

I wanted a TV that was at least 19-22 inches (diameter) and discovered that most 19 inch screens were only 720p.  My research found that there were ample models available with 1080p in the 22 inch (and above) models and that is where I maintained my focus. I decided to stick with what I know, and went with Samsung models, since I own 4 other Samsung models of various sizes, and have never had a problem.This TV was ready to go, out of the box, and sat perfectly on the counter, with setup taking only minutes. I spent $50 on a GOOD \"Monster\" HDMI cable, to make sure my picture quality would remain 1080p \"quality\".Needless to say, the TV works flawlessly, and the picture quality is exceptional. I have read other reviews that stated the base was \"wobbly\", but I have not had similar experience thus far.

It zooms in and appears more like the image on maybe a 34 inch TV. But now you don't get the edges of the image and for many sporting events the score is partly off the screen.

My opinion, the big tv's should be in the living room. Anyway, another thing I love about this tv is how light it is. Almost doesn't feel like you're carrying a tv at all. The sound quality, however, isn't the best, but it's not bad either. Guess it's really up to the owner's opinion on the sound quality. Anyway, one bad thing about this tv, and I'm assuming it's because of how light it is, is that the tv is very wobbly on its stand. Bump the table that it's on top of and the tv will shake enough to worry you, so be careful with this thing. Overall though, I'd recommend buying this as a bedroom tv or desktop monitor.

The screen rates are great, colors are good and It literally brings a depth to anything you are looking at. I like in a one bedroom apartment for college and the size is a perfect balance for comfortable viewing, gaming or writing essays with multiple documents open. The number of HDMI ports is a blessing and makes cabling much much simpler. With all of this in mind here are some problems that I had.1) you have to set up each input to format what type it is receiving. I.e. HDMI1 is \"game\" and HDMI2 is a pc connection. If you fail to do this the picture quality goes down and even makes text blurry.2) There is not a dedicated audio in for the \"HDMI/DVI\" connection which effectively means that if your desktop does not have an HDMI port your desktop audio cannot run through the TV speakers without an additional converter (around $30 more dollars). For myself, I use a DVI to HDMI cable and wear headphones. If your computer has an HDMI out this will not be an issue however alot of desktops these days have DVI instead (CURSE YOU DVI).3) the stand is kind of short, it was awkward for me when it was sitting on my desk so I use a little stand that the TV and stand sits on. Purely preference.4) the curved nature of the remote means that it falls of of any edge you place it near. Late night viewing can be a hassle as the buttons are not lit and everytime it falls off of the counter you have to go hunting for it.All in all, I gave the product 4 stars, I bought this item on sale and I love it, totally worth the purchase. While there are some \"cons\" with the product they are mostly preference based and probably will not effect most users.TL:DRGreat for xbox/pc/PS4 users as long as you do not use DVI connection.

I just found out today that I cannot connect small speakers to this tv after having a chat with samsung customer service. By the way, there customer service has been good to me thus far. I chatted with them twice and both times I didn't have to wait very long for support. My only thing I can point out regarding this tv is the sound. For a HDTV of this size compared to other tv others on the market it is okay but could be better. While watching a movie i find myself adjusting the volume from time to time because I can't seem to get it just right. When I'm playing my ps3 I dont have to adjust the volume as much for some reason. Right now this tv is connected to an old VCR, remember those? Also it is connected to my ps3 slim and even an old video game system. (An original X-box system) I am using one HDMI port in the back of the tv and there is another HDMI port not in use. By the way, you have to figure out how to adjust the video settings on your ps3 directly to unlock the full 1080p potential on most games otherwise the tv might switch to 720p instead.Easy to set up, Great value and features for the price.

Beasley", "ReviewID": "R2W03K9YWJ4D66", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this model because of the dimnesions ... I had a very tight space I wanted to put this in and minimal depth was critical.  The TV is only 1.6\" deep but this is a bit decieving because you have to consider the input panel is straight off the back and the connector you are going to use will add to the depth requirement.  The picture is good and sharp with no perceptable motion ghosting (even though it is a 60Hz display) ... but I would expect that because its only 22\" and 1080p.  Despite the number of reviews that bark about poor audio, I found that the sound is not bad considering the small size.  Booming, room-filling sound from a set of small, 1.5 inch speakers is an unrealistic expectation, (c'mon, folks ... these are basically laptop PC speakers).  As far as the complaints about no audio ouput, I checked the specs again and there is no mention of one, so I am not sure about this complaint.  Most configurations will drive this display with a cable box or sat reciever anyway ... If you need an audio source for exteranl speakers or headphones, just use the audio from the box\\reciever (read: Y-adapter if you are not using HDMI).  Side-to-side viewing angles are resonable but you will need to angle the TV down if you plan on mounting it in an elevated position.  Just a small angle viewing upward will quickly wash-out the picture ... this is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I do like SRS but I don't like to turn on one option to amplify sound I like a variety of options and sadly this set does not have it.I knew this going in and was going to replace my B2230HD set with this since it has LED  and the B2230HD doesn't. The picture in this set is very clear for watching TV but that is not the only thing I use a set for. I decided to put this in the hotel room and stay with my old Samsung set.

After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.  This problem is systemic in all their LCD's and LED's.  Consumer's have complained all over the internet.  There are even numerous Youtube postings with the exact same problems as in my DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG model, as well as the same DEFECT in many other DEFECTIVE SAMUNG models.  This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00!Furthermore, I was informed that the repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....at which point the technician basically stated, \"just buy another TV.\"SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at a rate of 20% per year, and that they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!  Their own repair people told me to just buy a new set!!!If I save one family the heartache of losing they're hard-earned money on SYSTEMICALLY DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG TELEVISIONS, and a company that offers zero customer service....I'll be happy!

Being as the Samsung has been number one for years, and that I have enjoyed my 46 inch, I , of course, had to get the Samsung. After looking for a great deal, I found the deal at Amazon.com. This 22 inch is a perfect size for my bedroom. The LED, I honestly do not see the big difference between that and the LCD. Always make sure you get a TV, with the 1080p. It does make a difference. Also, whenever you do buy a new HDTV, you do need the HD service with whatever you use for the programming. Without it, the picture looks too wide, and you can not change that format. Also, the color is much better and you don't have to change the adjustments each time you change the channel. I had mine for a week without HD service, and did not like what I was watching. Once I did get the service, my TV is a great as my 46 inch is. No matter what brand you choose, make sure you do get the HD service. This is very important, no matter what salesperson tells you that it does not make any difference. The latest is the LED, so stick to that. The LCD is going out, and that is why you can get super deals right now.  Like I did say, my LCD satisfies me 100%. If saving more money is what you want, and do not care if it is the LED, by all means buy it. Now this model is suppose to be 2011. It didn't turn out that way. Mine was made in October, 2012. It is the super slim model. Really light in weight. This is also the Series 5, which also means the best to buy. Really, Samsung is certainly the best choice in the Television entertainment world.
