Wagner", "ReviewID": "R2OAGPT0Y0MEPD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for three weeks now and I'm very happy with it.  I went with the small end of the HDTV line because I have a moderately sized apartment and didn't want the set to dominate my living room.  The 32\" screen is a nice, modest size and the picture quality is great.  Going for 1080p rather than 720p might be overkill at this size, but it's nice to know I have the sharpest image money can buy and it'll make a stunning second monitor for my computer.I'm glad that they put a matte finish on the glass so that there's much less glare than on my old standard TV.  The border is shiny piano black but I haven't been troubled by reflections or fingerprints.  I also haven't noticed any problems with uneven backlighting or bad pixels.  When watching non-widescreen programs the set will let you choose from black sidebars, stretch, or zoom.  I wish it were smart enough to automatically zoom in on letterboxed low-definition shows but it's easy enough to switch manually.I was surpised at the diversity of input ports: multiple stereo audio jacks, component, composite, S-video, cable, and HDMI.  The set will let you rename the inputs on-screen and disable inputs that you don't use.I'm very pleased with the speakers.  The sound quality is quite good and, unlike many sets, the volume covers the entire range from very quiet to blasting with fine control.  My old set went from \"not quite loud enough\" to \"annoying loud\" with a single press of the volume button.  I know that many people hook up external sound systems these days but for my purpose I'm glad to have good built-in speakers.The remote control is perplexingly big.  The buttons are small and widely spaced.  There's also a flip-open compartment with four small buttons inside.  Why they didn't just put those buttons on the surface is beyond me.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Must read for anyone interested in this TV!", "Author": "J.

It's a wonderful TV to be sure, but it has risks that I'd like to warn everyone about.When I received my package, it was damaged on delivery (a big crack in the speaker) and had 12 dead pixels. Amazon and UPS took care of the replacement about a week later and I received another unit that was in perfect condition, but appeared to have already been taken out of the boxonce. Hmm, maybe a refurb? I don't know, but it has no dead pixels this time around and since I bought it as a \"new set\" I have a \"new\" warranty, not a refurb warranty.I have heard from doing lots of research on this TV that certain sets suffer from dead pixels while ones not built in the Japanese plant do not. My own experience would seem to corroborate this idea. For instance, my original TV with the 12 dead pixels said \"Manufactured in Japan\" on the back. This new one, which is the same model but of a different batch, says \"Manufactured in Mexico\" (and has NO dead pixels!). Caveat emptor!Another important thing to note:This TV DOES support 1080p over both Component and HDMI (this is relatively unclear from every website I've read, and most TVs only do 1080p over HDMI!)For the price, this TV is a steal. The picture quality is superb. I bought a miniDVI -> HDMI cable for my girlfriend's Macbook and watch 1080p content on it all the time.

I don't even like NASCAR, but FOX HD made me feel like I was right there. No uneven backlight issues,no blobs or anything else. Mine came out of the box looking great. For this price, I advise you give this TV a look. Once I hooked it up to a Blu Ray player, it looked GREAT. I highly encourage this TV for small living spaces like mine.

I made the mistake of taking it to the authorized repair facility, instead of returning it to the vendor immediately. It took them four weeks to finally shoot me down, by which time I could no longer return it to the vendor. Now I own a very expensive television that makes me angry every time I watch it.

Currently I have a standard def DVD player, Comcast HD cable box, and an Apple Mac Mini connected to it. I'll give you a run-down on how each fares:Standard DVD:The picture looks great, and even though not HD it does not pixellate or blur as much as I'd thought it would. It is noticable that you are not getting a truly HD picture, but not enough to make me want to go out and immediately get an up-converting player.Comcast HD box:The standard channels look so-so, depending on the network and the time of day (prime-time channels are given more attention than off-peak), and HD channels simply scream with life. Discovery HD is amazing! The color balance is wonderful, and the blacks are astounding. It has \"living black\" as I like to call it, whereas many flat-panels have dull, flat blacks that wash out the picture. I am told that this is because some TVs display black as an inactive pixel (or something of that nature), whereas higher end TVs actually render the color black. My girlfriend's mother said that it was amazing because there was actually DEPTH to the picture. The amount of shows and networks broadcasting in HD on Comcast is a bit low for my liking, but that will change soon enough.I had tried connecting the cable directly to the TV, but since we get digital cable, the higher channels just showed up as 100.5 100.7 etc. Not exactly an easy way to tell which channel you're watching.Apple Mac Mini computer:I had some issues getting the picture to come up. The TV just kept telling me that there was no compatible signal. Since I had no other monitor I had to enable the text-to-speech feature and feel my way to the picture settings in the control panel. When I turned off the \"TV overscan\" setting, bam, signal. The picture looks good enough, but not as good as i'd hoped. Maybe the Mac Mini just doesn't have the cahones to push that great of a picture to a monitor this big. One other downside is that the picture does not fill the whole screen, but rather leaves about a 3/4 inch of black all around, which reduces my visible image to about 29\" in the end. Still huge, but I'd rather have the whole she-bang. I am told Apple TVs fare a lot better in this department, but I want to do more than they offer.*EDIT* I cured the overscan issue and got the full screen real-estate of the Mac Mini by using a program called DisplayConfigX (12 bucks) which lets you set a custom screen resolution. I recommend setting it to 720 and working from there. The 1080i resolution makes everything so small that it ends up being pretty much useless. I also puchased a Wii controller, \"wireless\" wii bar, and a bluetooth dongle and with a program called RemoteBuddy you can use the Wiimote as a media center remote, though I've still got to iron out some kinks, like clicking stuff (the wiimote isn't steady enough to click without it registering as a click-and-drag).All in all, I love the set. I love it so much I had the 42\" model purchased for our lounge area at work, and that one works just as well. I compared similar size competitor's sets at the local big-box store, and most were easily inferior to this set, with the exception of the larger Samsung models that support 1080p (I like the look of the Samsung models more, but sadly they don't make a 32\" model that has 1080p), and I am told that Sony brand sets are superior to these, but come at a premium I wasn't prepared to shell out.", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Reviewer Ryan", "ReviewID": "R1DGPD7R5YTSKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband got the 42\" version of this set mainly to watch his never ending sports.  I liked it so bought the 32\" for my movies. It's great for both HD and standard programs which we receive via cable. I have the cable company's DVR box and that's working well with this set. I rent movies from Netflix and all of those have looked fine though I still have a standard DVD/VCR combo. The sound is fine and this TV looks very nice as well.  Thanks to all of you who reviewed Sharp in the past as I chose the brand in part due to your recommendations. One thing, the picture on the 32\" seems slightly better than the picture on the 42\" but that may be the way I adjusted the picture. My husband likes his brighter, wants to be blinded by ice when he watches hockey, or so I surmise.  Maybe it's just the size of the screen that makes a difference, but both are basically great.", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Damn good HDTV", "Author": "Justin C. Sallows", "ReviewID": "RXD5OZ3OLQ1BB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I was shopping for a new HDTV this spring, I did a search of everything I wanted in one. The 62U popped up right away because it has everything. And it all works fantastic too. The built in ATSC tuner is stunning! I had a digitalstream external tuner for my last TV and it was very touchy. I had to readjust the antennae all the time. Not so with the 62U. There's still the occassional adjustment, but for the most part everything comes in beautifully all the time.Let me get to the problems with this set. Aquos are notorious for banding, both horizontal and vertical. Mine has it too, but it is pretty subtle. You only notice it vaguely on occassion and if you turn down the brightness a tad and maybe turn up the contrast a skoshe it's gone. It's not a big deal on my set, but it may be worse on others so you should be aware of it.Also the contrast could be better. The 62U comes with a feature you can turn on that automatically adjusts the picture to suit the ambiant light. That's nice, but it darknes the picture down. You may decide to keep this feature on all the time anyway because the darknening gets rid of the gray black areas. This is only in large dark areas so if you're watching Batman Begins for example it may become more obvious.Overall this set has an extraordinary picture, the built-in speakers are good and the features are very helpful. The digital noise feature is amazing by the way. Again it's a compromise sometimes because it can give a weird strobe effect at times, but it does what it says and eliminates all but the heaviest grain/noise.This set makes everything look as good as it possibly can, very highly recommended.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice TV, but Sharp support is sub-par", "Author": "GRMaddy", "ReviewID": "R2O4VJA9DEFLQU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE 10/25:  After Sharp told me that one dead pixel was normal, the tv stopped working and just had a continuous flashing green power light. (I know, how convenient).  Sharp wanted me to schedule the TV for service via a local service center, and after not hearing from the service center I decided not to mess around any more and called 6Ave and advised the TV stopped working 20 days after delivery.  6Ave has a 30day replacement guarantee if your tv up to  32 inches proves defective.  Instead of waiting for the service center to repair my tv and since it did have one bad pixel, I opted for 6Ave to send me a DHL shipping label to return my tv for a new replacement.  It took 6 days to get the label and four days after returning the TV to get the replacement (a brand new set).  The new set works fine and I do not see any bad pixels on this one.  We'll see how it lasts during the next 30 days, but based upon this experience I am somewhat concerned about the SHarp quality control and willingness to stand by what is deemed acceptable from the LCD pixel standpoint.  The picture does look great and the features are nice, so as long as you get a set with no bad pixels you should be satisfied.  I would strongly encourage you to understand your return options if you order via mail-order.  You'll pay more buying directly from a store, but atleast you can conveniently return for replacement in shorter period of time.ORIGINAL POST:THis is my second Sharp HD LCD that I purchased. I had no problem with Amazon or 6Ave in the order/delivery process with prompt delivery from 6Ave.  I did have one bad pixel on the screen which is almost impossible to see unless you are directly in front of the tv and looking for it.  I called Sharp technical support and they advised that this is within their normal tolerances for an LCD. I was very pleased with the picture quality and features of this Aquos unit, however, after 4 weeks of using it the tv screen went blank this morning and now won't even power up.  Sharp was supportive in creating a support request with the nearest service center and I am awaiting their callback to schedule the service visit.  My parents had a Sony LCD that had an LCD go bad within the first month, so I know from talking with the service tech then that if your display is going to malfunction it will usually occur within the first 30-60 days of use. If it wasn't for the bad pixel and now having to deal with a service call, I would have given this five stars.", "Date": "October 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Maximum Resolution at Minimal Size", "Author": "Gerald D. Avery \"Movie Buff\"", "ReviewID": "R1GO5S2GJH2OD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this television exclusively for my PS3 and to watch Blu-Ray and HD-DVD movies on, so I can't comment on how it looks on standard or high definition programming. But for my uses it looks great. My PS3 games look amazing. I'm in the middle of a baseball season on MLB'07 The Show, and it looks so real that it's scary. I was going to go with a 720p set, because a majority of the games being made now are being made at that resolution. I tried a few 720p sets. I tried a few Samsungs and I also tried an Olevia. The Olevia looked good, but there was no depth behind the color. Of course the Samsung looked great with plenty of deep, vibrant colors, but the games just didn't look as good as I thought they should. This television delivers deep, vivid colors with crystal clear clarity. Blu-Ray movies and HD-DVD movies also look great. I was hesitant about spending this much money for what amounts to a gaming monitor, but hey, you only live once right? I'm still a plasma man at heart, I have a Panasonic plasma in my den that I receive my high definition programming over. Plasma has always been my preference, because I think the colors are deeper than LCD and of course the black levels are much deeper. I'm waiting for the 1080p plasma's to come down in price over the next year, and that'll be my next purchase. I think for gaming LCD's are a better choice. The picture is much brighter and no burn-in issues. So if you're thinking about buying this television, go ahead and do it, it would be a wise decision. The price alone makes it a smart buy. Of course 1080p at anything under 42\" is overkill because you have to sit so close to the screen to reap the benefits, but it works for me because I'm sitting close to the screen when I game or watch a movie.

It had arrived just before Major League's playoff began. Sport programs like playoff and NFL in HD are super amazing. I can't go back to 4:3 pictures.Time Warner Cable in my area provides HD subscribers with free HBO channels, one of which is in HD. Viewing movies in HD is also superb.The HD set-top-box is connected to the TV with a component cable. The TV does not have a DVI input (but has two HDMI inputs).This unit has some cool features (maybe other products have similar ones) such as \"dynamic picture\" which adjusts picture settings automatically based on the ambient lightings. You can also manually choose, say, \"movie\" which is less vivid than other settings and good for watching movies in a dark room.Please note this if you often use closed caption. As long as the set-top-box is connected via component, you may not be able to use TV's closed caption feature. I won't blame the TV of this because as I did research online, I've found that there is no specification on closed caption signal transfer over component. So it may be that the set-top-box doesn't send out the closed caption signals over component. Or it may be that the TV doesn't receive the CC signals on component. A workaround for this is to have the set-top-box insert the caption by itself, whose font is less clean than the TV's (but legible, of course).Overall, this TV is a great buy for this quality and relatively affordable price and highly recommended. Be informed that Sharp is the leading company in HDTV in Japan. I would say Sharp's HDTVs are more popular than Sony's. My parents in Japan have a 37\" Sharp HDTV, which is of incredible quality.

I don't mean to sound like a shill, but there are so many reasons I'm happy with this television. I was buying without any experience with the brand, but it has really proven itself with this unit.It was easy to set up; you just screw in a few bolts with the parts included. The actual television is so modern and stylish. I've so enjoyed just looking at it and admiring the smooth, glossy finish. The actual picture quality is great, though I have to admit I have yet to plug in a 1080p source [there are plenty of other reviews that would confirm that aspect's quality, I'm sure]. Everything is definitely grainier because of showing low resolution sources on a hi-def screen, but I'm absolutely confident that when I get a 360 hooked up later on, it'll be splendid [those HDMI ports are just waiting for love]. The physical screen, by the way, is great; it's TFT, meaning it's more matte than shiny, and thus easier to see with light on it.The menu was a big deal to me; I'm still enjoying the clean, attractive interface, but the main thing I like so much is how easily some functions work with the remote. Since I'm using sources that aren't hi-def, I like to stretch them out to the edge of the screen. The remote has a button [view mode] to switch through several stretched-out viewing settings, and I've found that really useful.

Using a converter cable between the computer's DVI port and the Sharp's HDMI port, the resolution displayed is 1920x1080 on the Sharp.  The user has to select an input mode on the Sharp that is \"pixel-to-pixel\", which basically gives you your computer screen exactly as you see it on your laptop.  In MS Word I can display 3 pages side-by-side at 100% document zoom.  12 pt font is readable, but not great.  At 125% zoom I can display 2 pages side-by-side, with about 6 inches extra space on the screen on each side, and the 12 pt font is fairly smooth and readable.  At 150% document zoom, I have 2 pages side-by-side filling the Sharp screen and the 12 pt font is easy to read.  The panel that I received had no dead pixels.  Every now and then at startup the computer does not recognize that it is connected to the Sharp as an external display, though I can fix this with some fiddling.  The other similar Sharp model that ends in gp1u has a dvi input port, which may help in this situation, though it's not significant problem in my case.

Planned on using it for my recently boughten PS3 (Playstation 3). And I have got to say, that this is def. a great TV to own, if you're looking for an HDTV on a budget. Esp. a gaming one.I got mine for about 580 dollars.I have practically nothing but positive things to say about this HDTV! It has 2 HDMI slots. Which means you can connect a gaming system, and an HD Satellite Reciever or Cable Box, all in 1 sitting. You can have HD gaming, and HD television. So right off the bat, this is def. a great TV for the next-gen gamer. As stated, I have my PS3 hooked up to this badboy, and it runs BEAUTIFULLY!Also, about the size...it's actually quite big! The TV is about as wide as a yard stick. That's 3 feet wide. And about 2 feet tall. The screen diaginally (from corner to corner) is about 31-32 inches, total. It looks amazing. It's like a great personal home theater TV. Guarinteed to impress all your friends, and will leave the viewer with no complaints about it's size.Afterall, bigger is better.My only real complaint about the TV, is that if you're too close to it, the screen looks a tad bit blotchy, and the pixels somewhat show. but if you're far enough away from it (about 4 feet or so) it's completely fine.However, this does NOT effect video gaming whatsoever.All in all, I def. suggest this TV as a purchase to all those looking for a great HDTV on a budget. Esp. to all you gamers out there, like myself. As this will def. make any HD compadible system (Xbox 360/PS3) look very much alive, when it comes to it's game titles.I can't wait to play Assassin's Creed on this thing. =PI give this TV, a 5/5.Despite it's grainyness at close distances, this TV is serving it's purpose QUITE WELL as an HD gaming TV, and a personal mini HD home theater for my PS3's built-in BluRay Player. And it's also quite decent when it comes to cable TV, as well. Even without HD. The picture still looks good.The grainyness might bug you a bit, if you're used to sitting close to your set. However, the \"Dynamic Display\" option will pretty much fix this problem up, if you want to sit close to the television, and don't want to be 4 feet away from it to produce a perfect crystal clear picture while watching TV.It'll make the screen a bit dimmer (darker), but the grainyness will be all but noticeable.

The Comcast guy installed a regular old coaxial cable from the Comcast box to the TV and the image was dreadful.  I upgraded to a high definition box from Comcast and still the image didn't improve.After fiddling with the image quality controls for the Comcast box (not an intuitive process since you have to TURN OFF the Comcast box and THEN hit the MENU button to fiddle around) I finally got the image acceptable for broadcast TV.So after all that I bought a $99 HDMI Monster cable to hook up the Comcast box to the TV and I used the Comcast-supplied Component cable (with the high definition box, NOT with the original box) to hook up the DVD player to the TV.More fiddling with color warmth and image sharpness and stretch or don't stretch the image and so on, but in the end it was all worth it.  The image quality is quite nice finally.As a bonus I bought Apple's Mini-DVI to DVI connector and a cable to connect it to the TV and now I can do my computing on my Mac laptop with the screen readable and HUGE clear across the room.  I love this feature.  It works spectacularly and the image quality is beautiful.This is also a GREAT price for this TV through Amazon.  Circuit City sells it for $1,299 in stores and for $1,050 or something like that on their web site (a price they'll match in stores if you're smart enough to ask for it).I would have given this TV a full five stars except for the fact that personally I think you (and I) should get the next size larger.  I use this one in the bedroom and even there I wish I'd gotten the next size larger of the Sharp Aquos.  That would have been perfect.As for the remote, it's simple to find things on it and it's surprisingly large.  One weird thing about it is they have controls in a closed panel at the bottom that you have to flip open to access.  I see no advantage in this and it's only by reading the manual (and not being able to find the buttons illustrated) that I realized there even was a lid in the bottom.  Silly design.  No matter though.  I use my Comcast remote to do everything.  The only thing I use the Sharp remote for is the INPUT button (to switch from broadcast TV to the DVD player and back).  Probably there's a way to do that with the Comcast remote but I haven't found it yet (or I can program it into my universal remote at some point).", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a great price", "Author": "Dennis L.

That is without expedited shipping, granted it was shipped from NJ and I live in PA. Timing was perfect and the item came unmarked.Communication was great- received emails confirming order, shipping/tracking status.Mainly bought the TV for PS3. The same day it came plugged it in and in looked pretty good. Then I went and bought the appropriate cables (HDMI) and what a difference. Even my girlfriend thought some of the games looked better than some movies. Blurays- speechless.I would recommend though as a bedroom TV or a smaller sized room not as the main TV. I got it for the bedroom and I can't be more please with the product and size. But, if I had the same TV in the main room, I would want bigger than 40.

The picture on every console is fantastic, even the Genesis.  The 360 looks especially nice because this TV puts out in 1080p even with component cables, where many TVs, including Sony Bravias, only do 1080i though component.In normal words, the TV looks great, even sitting very close.

But I have to say that a glossy frame is very impractical, and just plain stupid. Here's why:On the same day the TV arrived, dust started to accumulate on the glossy frame. It makes the TV look like it was in a bad wash job out of a dishwasher. And when you try to wipe the dust off, you get streaks everywhere. The tiny dust particles scratch it; and there is NOTHING you can do about it.Now let's get to the image quality. For some reason, this 1080p display appears to not show anything progressive. The TV said it was receiving 1080p, but I still noticed lines that looked like scan lines. Scan lines in 1080i looked only slightly worse when playing a movie. Playing 1080p PS3 games showed that there is a significant visual difference between 1080p and 1080i: much more aliasing everywhere.I was able to tell when I was watching First Blood on Blu-Ray. Then I started seeing it everywhere. It's also easy to spot if I get close to the TV and move my head up and down. I was very disappointed. I wasn't too upset about the three or four dead pixels that I got, but this got me upset.So because I wasn't sure if this flaw was a characteristic of the display, I sent it back and got a Sony 32S3000.
