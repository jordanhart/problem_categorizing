{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the price, spectacular", "Author": "Steven", "ReviewID": "R325A1MOZVXA9B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After looking at the current selection of budget brand TVs, I decided to go with something from TCL. I've used their computer monitors in the past and have trust for the brand. I considered the other obscure Chinese brands such as Seiki, Coby, etc. Even considered Insignia, but have been disappointed with build quality and style.Upon unboxing, I was impressed by the glass stand and the overall aesthetics of the TV. It's conservative looking, but definitely not cheap. Doesn't have that wavy, shiny black plastic bezel that most budget TVs tend to have.Picture quality is great, not a whole lot of adjustments, but not a whole lot need to be made in my opinion. It does have an MHL port, so if you have one of those Roku sticks, or some small device that just relies on an HDMI port to power it, this TV has it. Not a lot of TVs have that yet, much less at this price point.One thing I am disappointed about, although understandable, is the sound quality. Obviously something had to be sacrificed, but you can definitely still listen to them. There's just not a whole lot of range the speakers provide. They sound tinny, and sharp treble is abundant with little bass to speak of. The equalizer is bizarre as well, with adjustments labeled as frequencies, not your standard \"Bass\" \"Mid\" and \"Treble\".Small complaints aside, can't beat the price, built quality, or the picture quality. For a budget brand, I would say TCL would be your best bet.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Warning: misleading refresh rate, this is NOT a 120hz TV", "Author": "Gregory", "ReviewID": "R24SKVJ8R9EZHZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm a PC gamer and I am starting to migrate from 60fps to 120fps gaming, so I need a 120hz TV/monitor. In my search I found this TV here on Amazon at an incredible price and I purchased it at once, totally fooled by the \"120Hz Clear Motion Index\" thing, believing it was the true refresh rate of the TV.IT IS NOT. These greedy \"big\" companies are inflating this number in order to fool innocent people and sell more; SONY, Samsung, Toshiba, TCL, all of them are doing it, they are replacing the true refresh rate by these fake, misleading \"Clear/Ultra\" refresh rates, so a true 60hz TV gets \"Clear Motion Indexed\" using some tricky formula (something about the backlight during the processing) and then labeled as a \"120hz\", which of course is a nasty lie because the TV is actually 60hz. You, as an innocent buyer, will not notice it if you use your TV to watch TV or DVD/Blu Ray, as those are not streamed (yet) at 120fps, but at 30-60fps. The worst thing is that they are replacing the actual refresh rate with this inflated number on the specs and box of these products, on the webpages of the products and everywhere else.I didn't knew this at first when I purchased it, but the \"Clear Motion Index\" thing got me suspicious and I started to investigate, glad I did, because I would have wasted my money. As soon as I found out this lie I cancelled the order, and now I'm here to warn you: if the refresh rate in the specs of the TV says something like \"Clear Rate\", \"Aqua Motion\", \"TruMotion\" or some other similar techy phrase, then most likely it's not the actual frame rate of the TV but the inflated lie. Investigate before purchasing a TV, I learned my lesson.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R8T3KC5QSYN1Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a solid tv, and for the price the picture is good. I mounted it on the wall, so the weight and thin profile is a huge plus. It has a good look to it as the border is very small and it has a clean look to it. I have used it quite a bit, and have had no problems so far. The sound complaints that others have mentioned are unwarranted, and if it exists then it must be specific to some units. The colors are very bright and vibrant, and that aspect makes up for a picture that is not as crisp as units that cost quite a bit more. I could easily see TCL increasing in price and popularity in the future. I know a decent amount about tvs having worked at best buy as a kid and developing interest from there. The reality is, a lot of tv companies use the same parts and in mass production all of the economic brands have some bad units, and unfortunately many of the high end ones are starting to have some issues as well. If you are on a budget I would pull the trigger on this brand. I was not sure what to expect for the price, but after having the tv for a few months it is definitely worth it.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good TV for the money", "Author": "MLO", "ReviewID": "R2UUCQ15ZKK2R7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Was looking for a 46\" LED TV. Among the ones I saw and read about, two manufacturers out of China stood out, Hisense and TCL. Both of these are pretty big companies, actually make their own stuff, and make TV's for a lot of other companies. I liked what I saw so thought I'd give one of them a shot. Finding a TV from either of these manufacturers is not very easy, they are not really mainstream in the US (yet). Couldn't find a Hisense one readily available and only managed to find a TCL here at Amazon. This one had some good features, was very up to date modern looking with a really slim design. The picture quality is very good, menu has plenty of adjustments and navigating through it is easy and intuitive. Mostly I really like this TV but there are a couple of issues I had with it. First is the sound. I don't know what's up with a lot of manufacturers these days that don't seem to regard sound quality as very important. A lot of the TV's I've seen had what I would call poor sound quality. This one is no exception. It's tinny sounding and the adjustments do improve it but not as much as I'd like. I managed to get it acceptable but just barely. I guess they figure that everyone buying one of these is going to be hooking it up to a sound system (which I have so at least I have two options). The second one is this TV has a reflective screen. My last one didn't and I never saw any reflections while watching it but with this one I do. Not as bad as a glass screen but it's there. For me this is going to take a little getting used to (but not a deal breaker). Dunno if all bigger screen TV's (46\" and up) have this reflective screen or not. My last 42\" did not. From what I've seen, the price is very good and the looks are very good. It sure does not look like a cheap TV (to tell the truth it looks as good as or better than any other TV I've seen). I regard my purchase as a really good one. This TV is actually pretty impressive and if not for the two issues I had with it, I would have easily given it 5 stars. Now time will tell if it holds up. I'm not too worried about that.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Diamond in the Rough - small price for high-price quality", "Author": "Michael Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1CEJYPNK83RIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the TV today, and after playing it on both my PS3 and PS4 (and watching a couple movies) - I'm EXTREMELY impressed.For a non-IPS screen, the viewing angles and blacks are stunningly good - and it blew my 32-inch Samsung LED TV out of the water (the EH4003). It's been perfectly bright for me in my small-ish room with sunlight pouring in, and I haven't seen any backlight bleeding whatsoever. Haven't tested out the speakers on the TV itself (have 'em plugged into a 5.1 computer speaker system), so I can't speak of their quality. Colors will need to be adjusted, as it's not perfectly calibrated (should only take ~10 minutes if you know what you're doing). The menu system has enough options to keep a techie like me satisfied, without being too bloated/slow. It has a glass base that's heavier than it looks, yet also looks really good. The remote is a standard remote - it works.To be honest, I was really scared buying it simply because it's an off-brand that I hadn't really heard of before. However, I'm convinced now - and I'll probably get TCL displays for now on (or at least until I can afford one of them fancy 84\" 4K UHD TVs).", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Important pls read before you buy.", "Author": "R. Longo", "ReviewID": "R1Q82J3AQHATBO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would give it zero stars if I could. Long and short purchased because of great value for the price plus the extra year warranty. Got the TV and didn't like the picture. Poor image sharpness and bright colors ( orange and yellow especially ) way over saturated to the point it would be very distracting. I felt my 2 year old Samsung much better picture quality but that's me. Everyone has there own tastes. Maybe the TV was defective. I will never know because I am about to explain to you why I plan to never buy a TCL product. It starts and ends with their customer service.Like I said earlier I had problems with the picture. I didn't just try to send it back I wanted to see if I could get it calibrated correctly. No settings manual or pre configured solved the quality issues. I called customer service and here is what I have experienced:12/12 Spoke to CSR who could not help. She was asking me to try options and settings which were not available on the TV. She finally admitted she did not have the correct manual for my TV. She asked me to call back the 800# after spending about 45 mins with her to get more help. I asked how is that going to resolve anything? Won't I just get another Level 1 CSR who doesn't have the correct manual? She did not have a response. I requested a Level 2 CSR call and assist.  My CSR said she would pass on. Never received a call.12/12 As a backup I also submitted an email to TCL US support.  I had to send an email because their online form was not working. I tried the online form a few more times after that day and it never worked.12/14 After no response or email conformation that TCL received my email. I followed up with a second email.12/17 Received email from USsupport giving the option for service or to return the TV.12/18 I asked for service because I do want to keep the TV if we can get the picture calibrated correctly or deem it defective and replaced.12/19 Received an email request regarding how the TV is displayed and contact info. They already had my contact info. TCL also wanted to know if it was on a wall or a stand. I am no guru but would love to know how that is supposed to impact quality of image or colors.12/19 replied and their follow up email same day requested me to take a picture of the TV picture. I kid you not. If anyone has ever taken a picture of their TV or computer screen knows the image and colors do not look the same. If you're curious go ahead and try.12/26 I followed up for a status update1/10 I followed up again after no response since my prior email on 12/19.Today enough is enough. I have waited candidly this long only because I purchased during holiday sales and after it became apparent that they were a company I didn't want to do business with I have been looking for another TV. Now that TVs are going back on sale with the NFL playoffs underway I am scheduling this TV to be returned.TCL representatives if you are monitoring this you are more then welcome to dispute because I have all of these FACTS in a long email chain.Good thing TCL has a 2 year warranty because you are going to need it.***** Update 1/21/14 *****As noted above I followed up once again on 1/10 having waited basically 3 weeks without a response. TCL USsupport finally sent me an email on 1/16 giving me directions on how to reset to factory defaults. So it took 5 weeks and 1 day to get something tangible to possibly correct the problems. How is this info not available to their 800 support line is beyond me. How I can get sporadic emails in the last 5 weeks that needed to know if the TV was mounted or on a stand or if I could take a picture of the image quality to troubleshootand and not this info is beyond me.
