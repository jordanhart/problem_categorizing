It is the only one that I haven't had to calibrate the picture because it is beautiful with the factory settings.  The picture looks great for Blu-ray and PS3 gaming.  It also looks great for over-the-air television channels, so it handles the high quality HD and low quality HD equally well.I purchased this TV because it exceeds Energy Star 4.0 standards, and Vizio has a great reputation for making TVs that last (unlike Samsung, which is a brand that I replaced when BOTH of my Samsung TVs stopped working).  This is also the only American brand, which all things being equal (and actually, they aren't because this TV outperforms other brands in my humble opinion) is a nice bonus for this purchase.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "VIZIO LCD/LED Lights up my HDTV experience", "Author": "Jack d'Enfield", "ReviewID": "R2293FJA7BC3N5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just obtained this model VIZIO HDTV a week ago, and am thoroughly satisfied with its performance in several media.

Haven't tried showing photos via USB or running laptop media yet, but it's nice to have this capability.

It needed no adjustment, the picture came up sharp and clear.The Vizio uses less than 1/3 the amount of electricity as the older, smaller set did. The picture is very bright and very sharp. It is also clear from a very wide angle (which was a surprise as well).

Stein \"Bengals Fan\"", "ReviewID": "RQJIWVAKYEFKK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 4th HDTV, and my 3rd Vizio (one returned), so I think I can write a worthwhile review.This replaces my 4 year old 37 inch Magnavox HDTV.  Was very pleased with it.  No problems.  Still sharp picture.  However, the color was no longer vibrant.  Moved it to a spare room for Wii play.  I think LCD TVs are good for 4 years max - due to color fading.  To be clear, color fading is tolerable in the kitchen TV, and bedrooms, but not in my main TV.I am satisfied with my one year old 32 inch Vizio kitchen LCD HD, and went with Vizio again.Since I was going from 37 to 42 inches, and have a glass stand, I wanted a light TV.  This weighs under 40 pounds, with stand.Easy to handle.  The base had a single screw (directions said 4, not true), which you hand tighten.  Easy installation.  The Magnavox base was difficult to install.  Had to call their tech support for help.These come with a good instruction manual, and are very easy to setup.  Sound is good.  Picture, very good in HD,  good in standard.  Soon, all programs will be in HD.  Blu Ray discs look great, as do sports events and movies.Purchased at my local warehouse club, as their extended contract pricing is very low.  I have had surge damage, on several occasions, and buy these warranties to protect against that.  Great price for a TV less than 2 inches thin.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "My First HDTV ROCKS!", "Author": "Kim Cantrell \"Soap Box Bandit\"", "ReviewID": "R179HGWH3PDPT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I *finally* broke down and purchased an HDTV. Before making the decision on which tv to buy, I researched brands, viewed friends/family's tvs, sought out other reviews. And the Vizio Razor Edge LED LCD won out.And after a couple of weeks, I can honestly say that I could not be HAPPIER.Although it was a bit fuzzy at first (making me fear that I had made the wrong choice), after approximately 40 hours of run time, the tv callibrated itself into the clearest, sharpest screen I have ever viewed.Yet, I must say that my FAVORITE feature has to be the thickness (or lack thereof, I should say) of this television.  After living a lifetime with those outdated, \"pregnant\" back televisions, I love that, although larger screen size, it takes up less space - really opening up a room. (Which I'm sure will only improve much more when we finish remodeling and transfer to a wall mount.)Remote:  super easy to program for DVD players, Wii.  (Was already fully functional for a Charter digital cable box)Side USB ports are wonderfully convenient for hooking up computer, camera, or flash drive.  Just plug in and go.While it may seem a little pricier compared to other brands of the same size, it offers more features, has superb quality, and is recommend not only by me but by numerous other reviewers.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Some are good, some are poor", "Author": "Kevin Wilcox", "ReviewID": "R32TQV9BIUNFT7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought one of these TVs and had a large clouding or \"backlight bleeding\" problem.  It made the blacks look very light, especially when viewing a dark scene on a movie or video game.  I knew that a slight amount was normal, but this was so much that it really hurt the picture quality on dark scenery. It was very annoying and was over 25% of the screen, so I returned it.  I bought an Vizio LCD TV instead and am very happy with it.I know someone else that has this model though and there are no problems at all.  The picture is great and the sound is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  I just think that edge lit LED TVs need to be researched a little more to reduce the clouding issues, because some of them are severe.

I rarely buy anything before researching it and tirelessly searching the internet for the best price.  I rarely write a review but in this case feel I need to.  So far this TV is outstanding. I learned that LED is a bit of a gimmick in some of the techno geeks opinions, unless you spend big bucks the the nicer models.  I have 3 other LCD tvs in my home all 1080 and 120hz.  This TV blows them all away.  It is just beautiful.  I did purchase a calibration disk as well.  It did help improve the picture considerably.  I hooked it up to my blueray that is internet ready.  Works awesome.  I found an HD site where they stream nature landscapes and sounds.  I thought it would be the true test of the TV's picture quality.  The jaw dropped.

Wish it had more features though", "Author": "scorpio88", "ReviewID": "R13WC1HN81308V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV, although I spent a lot of time looking at many models and other people's tv's before I bought this one. I originally wanted one that hooked up to the internet, but I settled on this one. Still, I wish this TV had those capabilities.The TV itself was very easy to set up. It came with a pretty easy to read manual with nice pictures. The remote is pretty intuitive - doesn't have a billion buttons like many of them do, but it has all of the buttons you need.I don't have cable TV, so I hooked this up to my Wii to test it out. The Wii only has 480i, so it was no where near taking advantage of the full HD resolution of this TV, but the Wii looked great. I streamed some Netflix movies over the Wii, and they looked excellent. Same with Amazon's streaming service - the picture looked great via the VGA cable off my computer.I recently purchased an Over the Air antenna, which picked up about 17 local channels. A few of them are in HD, and when I saw this, I was simply stunned. This tv displays HD content just as good, if not better than some of the bigger name brand (ie Sony, Samsung, LG) panels out there. It looked simply stunning.Sound is pretty good - not as good as my surround sound, but good for built-in speakers. Certainly some of the better built-in speakers I've heard.One little thing that I like is the Visio logo on the front - it glows orange when the TV is off, and white when the TV is on and/or warming up. I've found this useful compared to other TV's, where you have to guess whether they're on or off.I haven't tired any HDMI devices yet, but that will be next - Blu Ray player is the next thing I'm going to purchase.So, overall, I'm very impressed with the TV. Given the chance to purchase this or another TV again, I would purchase this one. It does everything I need it to, has great quality, and was a very good price.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superb TV!", "Author": "G. Landry \"author of The Bridge Tender\"", "ReviewID": "RBMKC13QH8PUQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a gorgeous HDTV with superb picture quality.  It's also fairly light weight and the base could not have been easier to assemble.  Altho the instructions say to insert multiple screws, only one is required and it has a clever little thumbscrew handle that allows you to tighten it by just using two fingers.  No tools required at all.  Assembly and set-up take no more than fifteen minutes, if that long.A week ago, I had originally bot the \"E\" series version of the 32 inch Vizio that has the internet apps and built in 802.11n wireless.  The model number was something like E320VL.  I liked the internet features a lot (Netflix, Facebook, etc.) but the picture quality was terrible.  The picture was dark and stayed dark no matter which settings I tried.  Thus, I was hesitant to try another Vizio.  But as soon I turned on this 42 inch model I could instantly see that the picture quality was vastly superior. I am so very glad now that I took the chance and returned the E320VL and got this model instead.  In addition to the far superior picture quality, the base for this model is also much more solid and there was a lot more protective wrapping on the unit.  Just a guess, but it appears that the E series must be Vizio's lowest quality model line.  This 42 inch model is part of the apparently higher quality M series. I do wish it would have the internet apps, tho.  Seems odd that a higher quality model line such as the M seies does not have such a feature while a lower quality model line such as the E series does.Have not noticed any problems with the sound so far, notwithstanding the complaints of some of the reviewers. Also, I was told by the salesman that this model is only a Razor \"edge-lit\" LED rather than a full blown LED (he claims that Sony uses the same method in its LED tvs, i.e., a mix of LCD bulbs and LED bulbs). However, the picture quality is just too beautiful thus far for that to be a factor to me, especially considering the much higher price of the HDTVs that are full blown LEDs.", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Suberb Picture, Terrible Sound", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "R249NY99K0NV3P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I bought this TV it was the cheapest LED screen available.

I'd suggest only buying if you want to use a surround system or sound bar.I have a few other points, 4:3 SD channels can be zoomed or stretched to fit the screen, but that setting also zooms or stretches when you go to an HD channel which is annoying. The Vizio logo lights up and cant be turned off either which isn't ideal.So amazing picture for the money but not perfect.", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hold on a sec, here.", "Author": "YRMV", "ReviewID": "R391J0T4SE7NG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Things I like about this TV:1) The image quality is MOST excellent, even right out of the box! Knife-sharp edges, killer contrast, accurate colors, eye-popping detail that few LCD TVs can match. Modern broadcast programs look almost three dimensional (and disturbingly odd). On the other hand, hockey games are mesmerizing. Even golf is fun to watch if only to marvel at seeing leaves on trees, blades of grass, and sweat on upper lips. Definitely the best LCD image I have seen on a reasonable priced TV.2)Energy consumption for such an image is also excellent. The back of the set gets barely warm. This was the feature that kept us from even considering a plasma TV3) Unpacking the TV was a breeze! 4 clips loosened the box and it slipped off in seconds. The base screwed onto the TV without needing a screwdriver. It took 10 minutes to go from box to watching Nature in HD.4) The curved edges soften the lines of the \"Forbidding Black Rectangle of Doom\" prevalent in large-screen TVs one sees in todays living rooms. It's a nice touch.5) I hook the TV up to my laptop and use it as a monitor when we want to cruise YouTube or look at photos. Again, the image quality is unparalleled...Things I hate about this TV:1) Unfortunately, I get better sound quality from my neighbor's antique radio. They must have used telephone speakers for this TV because that's about what the sound coming out of it is like. There are very few adjustments to be made that can improve the sound. If you want sound that is remotely acceptable, you WILL need an external audio package (amplifier + speakers). I knew this prior to purchasing my TV, so it wasn't a surprise; don't let it surprise you!2) The remote looks and feels like a cheap 20 year old cordless phone. The glossy finish means the unit constantly slips out of ones hands, unless yours are clammy. The buttons are all black and none are illuminated. You'll need a $5 Radio Shack clip-on book light to use the remote in your sexy, dimly lit media room. Either that, or keep the remote in your brightly lit kitchen when you want to use it.3) The Picture in Picture feature only works when viewing separate formats ie: TV and DVD. It will not work if trying to view two separate broadcast channels. Go figure.Overall:Every cent of your purchase goes into the image, with this TV. You definitely want separate speakers and maybe a usable universal remote.

Each year that passes by Vizio keeps putting out better and better products.  Edge lit LED on this tv gives such an incredible clear and crisp picture. Watching HDTV channels with direct tv etc gives an amazing picture from watching sports, to news, or movies etc.  With the tv being LED it puts off way less heat compared to most tvs and consumes less energy. The stock sound on the tv is no more than what any should suspect seeing that the tv is only 2 inches or so thick! Which is awesome.  If sound is an issue to you I highly recommend buying the vizio sound bar from amazon it adds incredible sound and increases the experience.  The size, picture quality, and over all performance of this tv is great. I've used the tv with hdmi for my ps3, watching hd television, and blue ray movies all which have really impressed me.  I highly recommend this tv to anyone for a bedroom or as your main living room tv.  Make sure to pick up hdmi cables off amazon and the sound bar with an optical cable if your willing to spend a few extra $.  Don't be fooled by paying tons of extra cash to go for a Sony or Samsung when you can get the same or close to quality with paying half the price by going with vizio.

I can understand that way of thinking. However, I decided to make a purchase at Christmas time. I actually purchased my TV on March 16,2011.All through Jan. and Feb. I spent hours online reviewing television adds and customer reviews. Additionally, I spent hours learning the meaning and definitions of the vocabulary of flat screen, digital televisions. After narrowing down my choices, I then went to local stores to visually compare pictures and to discuss prices and the different options available with sales people.In the end, plain and simply, I bought this TV because the picture compared equally or usually better than anything else I looked at. The different options met all my current needs while allowing for future expansion of my system. The Amazon.Com price, while slightly higher than my $500 - $600 original budget, was unbeatable and still is.That only leaves one thing worth worth mentioning, the sound quality. It is only a little better than average. The speaker openings are towards the back and bottom. However, I've never heard better quality from other display televisions without external speaker systems. Finally, I also wanted to support a competitive American made product. This TV is an excellent product.This television met my needs in every way possible. After 6 weeks I am still blown away by the picture, the price, and the overall experience.

We hoisted the dungheap back up on the wall and he began the Amazon return procedure. And to make what could have been a very long story, short, we received our new tv Saturday...... In our humble opinions it is a very good television, and the best 42\" led/lcd tv value you can find.  Despite reservations about working with a non-bricks and mortar store, the entire process was great (except for the 1st tv being broken), and until they prove otherwise, we will buy almost anything we can from Amazon.  My husband does his homework.... And he is happy......", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "amazon95258", "ReviewID": "R1SPF1C3XFYCS1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The built in speakers have a \"tin can\" sound quality to them.

I've never seen so many colors reproduced before. Yeah, it's only a 42\" screen but for the price, I haven't seen another TV in its class with a brighter, sharper, more colorful picture. We don't have HDTV satellite service so we watch TV in standard def and the picture is so-so. But with high-def dvds this thing shines. I don't own a blue-ray player but I don't see how the picture could be any sharper. We can see the texture on castle walls and trees we never saw before. And the colors just pop out at you from the screen. A great test dvd is Finding Nemo. On this TV, we watch the film and gaze in awe at the colors and the sharpness of the picture.The picture and sound are totally customizable. You can choose from factory presets or make up your own settings. I created my own picture settings for watching movies since I wasn't totally happy with the movie preset.The weak part is the sound. SRS TruSurround HD audio? Not from these thin speakers. I bought a separate surround sound system and combined with this TV, it's like I'm in a movie theatre. There are times I wish I had a 50\"-60\" screen, but it wouldn't be worth it if the picture wasn't this good.What I also really like about this set is the oval \"wings\" on each side. The set isn't your plain rectangular design you see everywhere. The unique design of the TV frame sets it apart from the others.There are people who claim that Vizio uses remanufactured parts in their TVs and that's why the prices are so cheap. I don't know about that. What I know is that Vizio sells a lot of TVs because the quality matches the higher priced brands. OK, the black on this TV may not be as black as another brand, but I'll put its color palette up against any brand any day.

The only downside I felt on the sound was there was no difference between the volume being on 20 and it being on 100. The other big downfall I found on the TV was the USB ports.  When you plug in something it asks if you'd like to play the pictures, music, or video on the device.  It never recognized anything on an iphone (but it charges it, just like any other USB port).  So I tried a regular ipod, and it recognized it, but didn't find any of the music, videos, or pictures in any folders on it, even though I'm certain there is.  I don't know if someone knows something I don't about that but that's what I experienced.  In the end I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great, new, big, TV for a great price.

I do not know how to describe what happens with the is television but to say that it makes things look too crisp and sharp.
