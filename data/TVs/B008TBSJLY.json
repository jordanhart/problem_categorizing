{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Glare made it very difficult to see/enjoy the picture", "Author": "John Seville", "ReviewID": "R3VXHE7ONHC5R7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The quality of the product is not in question.  It appeared to be an optical grade plastic and it did sit OK on my 70\" TV.  However, because they did not use an anti-glare surface the reflection was so bad that it ruined the quality of the picture.  Even with windows closed I could still see the reflection of items in the room making the viewing experience unacceptable.  Unless you're willing to live with the glare in order to avoid damage; do not buy this product.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid Screen Protector", "Author": "S.
