{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An Amazing Picture", "Author": "M. Ahern", "ReviewID": "RAX95XOKOVXET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new Sharp Aquos LC52D85U 52-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV arrived in 4 days, and 3 days early from the Video & Audio Center, in perfect shape. The courier helped me unpack, set up and place this monster on its stand. Great service does not get any better than that. I first plugged in the HDMI connection to my RR HD-DVR and then the power plug, sat down & and struggled to find the HDMI connection I had used in the onscreen menu -  there were so many inputs it was trial and error(didn't read the manual, no time!). Finally I landed on input 4 which was the live HDMI connection - the channel was set to a full HD channel and had a Fleetwood Mac concert recorded in 2004 playing in full glorious 1080i. I could see every strand of fly away hair and split ends on Stevie Nicks. Frankly I almost soiled myself because I was not expecting THAT degree of picture quality. I am still getting goosebumps from this beauty. This HDTV is just magnificent. The picture is bright, crisp and free of any banding issues. I can say without a doubt this TV will please even the most finicky of consumers. Tech types can tweak away at the hue and saturation controls to their hearts contect, color temperature, active contrast, fine motion are all customizable. The set even makes 480i HBO broadcasts look almost like HD quality.I have been reading online reviews and customer experiences for over 3 months on all brands of HDTV's prior to pulling the trigger, and I can assure you that you will not be disappointed with this HDTV. I am reluctant to touch the fine tuning picture controls for fear of messing with the already perfect, gorgeous picture right out of the box! One of  the reasons I ruled out other brands such as Samsung was the lack of a matte screen to combat reflective glare, as my living room has two banks of floor to ceiling windows & also with cathedral ceilings, facing south. Thus I was concerned with buying just an expensive mirror. It is so sunny in my viewing area an old CRT set was unwatchable during the brightest morning hours - not so this Sharp HDTV.  The anti-reflective surface completely eliminates any bothersome reflections. The viewing angle is just about as advertised, I can stand almost 75 degrees to the side and still can view the screen. Just an amazing set. I liked the way the TV will indicate the screen resolution upon changing to a new channel, I find this to be a nice touch. I really liked that the user can alter the range of the OPC and power saving feature so as to limit the degree that the set will automatically reduce brightness in a dark room.An aggressive price, & free shipping just clinched it for me; I had already decided on the Sharp. This a just a great HDTV, if you are considering this set at all, just go for it.", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best TV ever", "Author": "William R.

High Def is a joy with this TV and the 120hz fixes problems that have plagued previous LCDs. I wanted to go with the 65\" version but the price differential was difficult to justify. The 52\" version in my home theater looks great (even my wife was impressed). I hooked up the cable and BluRay player via HDMI and routed the audio from the TV to my 7 speaker Yamaha system via audio optical link.

The package of the Sharp Blu Ray player and free shipping tipped the scales for my purchase. I ordered just before Christmas and received my set about 2 weeks later. Set up was easy and I was watching a great picture in no time. The screen is bright and clear even with overhead lighting on or side light from windows. The remote and onscreen controls are easy and simple. My lack of a 5th star on my rating has to do with the sound. The sound built into the TV is marginal. It has no real volume at all. I know many of you will be using a separate sound system as am I for movies and general viewing, but there are plenty of times I turn on the TV just to check the weather or news and if there is any background noise in my house (like people talking)I can barely turn the volume up to the point it makes it clear to hear.  Would I take it back for another brand or model, no. Great TV & great value. Blu Ray movies are stunning and HD programs are clear as a bell. Now I find myself only wanting to watch HD programs, reminds me of when TV went from Black and White to color and my mom and dad would go through the TV book looking for the programs newly broadcast in Color and we would only watch those. Now I can't seem to watch those blurry standard broadcasts.I blame it on my new Sharp Aquos TV", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great HD TV BUT", "Author": "Movie Freak", "ReviewID": "R38HCYCG1UAXSK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great TV. The picture is so clear when watching Blu Ray. The only thing is that you will need a a home theather system. I had the volume all the way up and it was still low. But like my Army Sgt use to tell me, if you are going to do something do it right the first time. If you are buying such a big TV you must buy a blu ray, subscribe to  HD channels, and buy a nice home theater system. The 10000:1 contrast ratio is enough. Remember your average theater is showing at 500:1 contrast ratio.The 1080p is also a nice feature but only if you have a Blu Ray which transmits at 1080p. Your average cable company transmits at 480i to 720p.

The image quality is degraded somewhat coming from my HD Cable Box, but that is to be expected.With some programs, especially animated ones, I have noticed color banding, with one program in particular being an extreme case.

I looked at Sony, Samsung, Toshiba, etc. and decided against them based upon price/value for the Sony and Toshiba and the glossy reflective screen on the Samsung.  The Sharp is easy to set up and use and the picture is great despite some mediocre professional reviews that mentioned a lack of contrast and overly bright picture.  However, the professional purists refuse to use the features on TV's that are there to make them look better. Once Active Contrast is turned on, the contrast improves tremendously and the overly bright picture goes away. Coupled with the use of Fine Motion Enhanced, the picture is absolutely outstanding. I don't believe that for the money you can get a better 52\" LCD TV, especially if you don't want to spend a fortune on something that will be obsolete in a couple years anyway.", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "An elegant, mostly perfect display.", "Author": "Patrick Simpson", "ReviewID": "R3L4WZJ8T7IN65", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV about 6 weeks now, and am loving it. I was really tired of our 32\" and thought that I just had to have a 65\". Eventually, I compromised and bought this 52\"--it is more than big enough. The way they're measured diagonally, this thing is more than double the size of the 32\".I've got it hooked up to my 360 (1080p through component), PS3 (1080p through HDMI) and PC (DVI->HDMI)--all of which work well. Blu-ray on the PS3 is vibrant (even at non-calibrated settings), and DVD upscales well. The 360 looks good, but in some games there's a small ghosting effect (I'm not sure if it's the games themselves, only noticed it on Call of Duty 4/Call of Duty:W@W). The PC display is perfect, with crisp and vibrant text/colors.Honestly, I don't notice any difference when 120Hz mode is activated whether in Blu-ray, PC, 360 or PS3 game modes.The adaptive contrast mode is interesting, but it's not perfect--it's good for scenes that transition slowly.. but for quick changing scenes between light and dark, you can see the TV changing the brightness/contrast which is a little distracting.All in all, I would highly recommend this TV, but if I had to buy another one I would go for either the non-120Hz version of this model, or one with \"Dejudder\" technology that this TV doesn't have.", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great sports and action HD LCD!", "Author": "JMH", "ReviewID": "R19T1LOU8ARD6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched HD TVs for about 3 months and went to all the stores to compare picture quality and features.  I decided on the 85U Aquas because it had a great picture, a PC input and 120Hz processing for fast sports action.  Football games are great on this set and there's no motion lag like on the 60Hz LCDs.  I was torn between this set and the Samsung 750, but the Samsung has a glass cover over the screen which reflects a lot of light.  I have the Aquas in a large room and there is no glare from windows or lights.  I hooked it up to the Sharp Aquos BDHP21U 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player and they integrate very well together.  The menus are easy to navigate, hook up was easy and the HD picture is awesome!I was a little nervous ordering a big ticket item like this from Amazon with shipping and all, but they handled everything perfect and the delivery guy helped me set it up.

I did an agonizing amount of research and this seemed like the best deal for a 52\" TV.

HD programming looks outstanding as do DVD's. I expected bad sound and this was the case.  But a few days ago we switched from Direct TV to Comcast and my wife and I were stunned at how much better the TV sounded.  Night and day.

Any HD TV picutre quality relies on source of video , HDTV looks great. standard definition is blurred compared to CRT but this is meant for HDTV . Be prepared to buy a surround sound system with any HDTV because sound is not great with built in speakers . This TV has plenty of HDMI connections to meet different input from SAT/CABLE , DVD player , DVR etc . My only regret is I did not buy this with free sharp blue ray player  during X-mas sale .

Both LC-52D85U and LC-C5255U are 52\" LCD HDTV. I was very happy with LC-C5255U. Here are the reason for replacement.  1. LC-52D85U offers 120Hz rate, where LC-C5255U is 60Hz rate.  2. LC-52D85U response time is 4ms, where LC-C5255U is 6ms.  3. LC-52D85U has 5 HDMI inputs, where LC-C5255U has 4.  4. LC-52D85U costs me around $1495 from Amazon, where LC-C5255U costs me $1530 from local store.  I did quite some research before buying the LC-C5255U back in 11/2008. I am very happy with Sharp's HDTV on video quality. Like most of HDTVs, the audio part is limited due to 2 speakers only. I have a Panasonic 5.1 home theater system for the audio. Sharp's HDTV can take 1080p24 video, that's better than 1080p60. I don't observe blurry video when watching fast-action blu-ray disk with LC-C5255U (at 60Hz and 6ms response time). As indicated by other reviews, the image quality is great.  From video quality point of view, I can not tell the difference between LC-52D85U and LC-C5255U. They are both very good. I guess I need real fast moving movie to test the faster 120Hz rate and the faster 4ms response time from LC-52D85. The LC-52D85 also takes 1080p24 video. To my surprise, the LC-52D85U's remote control is more better than LC-C5255U's. It can also control VCR/DVD player and other external devices. The LC-52D85U's TV-stand is wider to make it more stable.  I am not comfortable in buying this big item with internet retailer due to difficult return process. However, being so happy with Sharp's 52 HDTV, I then take the courage to order this LC-52D85U with Amazon, and return my 2-month-old LC-C5255U.  Now, I take one point out, not because of the Sharp TV, it's due to the white-hand delivery service. The delivery people didn't set up the TV properly. I have to re-screw the TV-stand by myself.

Amazon had a promotion at the time whereby one could buy the television plus get either a free Sharp Aquos BDHP21U 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player or $200 off a Sharp Aquos Blu-ray Disc Player of your choice. I chose the free BDHP21U Blu-ray Disc Player. Also, because I live in a state where Amazon has a fulfillment center, I was required to pay sales tax on my purchase. All that being said, my total cost, which included free shipping, was $1,655.Originally the ordering system indicated it would be 5 to 7 weeks for delivery. I was hoping to have it by the first of February to watch the Super Bowl. The 52\" HDTV arrived in just over 10 days, which made me happy. The Blu-ray Disc Player arrived about two weeks after that, which was fine as it was still well within the original promise delivery time.As far as picture quality, it is fantastic. Now I have to admit I'm not a TV-ophile, or whatever they're called, but I know what I like. I also own a 42\" Vizio 1080p, which I enjoy, too. But it just isn't in the same league as my Sharp. I bought the movie \"Iron Man\" on Blu-ray through Amazon, too (only about $16 vs $30 that Walmart wanted) and it is absolutely awesome.Anyway, I've had my setup for just over a month now and I am extremely pleased with it.

LeVan", "ReviewID": "RL34R9WGVQI0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm no TV expert. I'm just a girl who wanted a new TV about four years ago. My previous TV was a 32\" CRT-style, really big and heavy, so this was my first flat screen purchase. I bought it in a store full of TVs, so like a lot of people, was clueless about how a big TV would look in my own living room. I probably would have been fine with something closer to 40\", but I got used to the big TV fairly fast and now everything else looks tiny.Color: I'm not a color scientist, but I have taken color theory classes (art school) and work in the design field, so true color is pretty important to me. I've got no complaints. Four years and the color still looks bright and bold, but not overly saturated, and seems to be fairly accurate for what I'm looking at on screen (denim is blue, red-headed actresses have red hair). How perfect it is, I do not know, but the color is good enough that I don't think about it.Brightness: I got this TV while living in a condo that had giant doors and windows along one wall of the living room (no curtains). The afternoon sun blasted in the room so I wouldn't have bothered trying to watch General Hospital with the old TV because I knew I'd never see anything. This flat screen though, comes with a feature that senses ambient light and does a pretty good job adjusting brightness and contrast to match. On a super sunny day, I'd still suggest curtains or shades, but it was watchable compared to what I had before. In my new house, we don't get hit with direct sun in the living room, but it can get bright. The auto-sensing feature is turned off but I never have trouble with screen brightness. Overall, this seems to be one of the better features of the TV and again, four years later, the brightness and contrast seem like new.Sound: I've heard a lot of people complain about sound quality when switching to a flat screen, but that's definitely not a problem with this TV. I don't have extra speakers and I hear everything just fine. I've watched Star Trek Next Generation on Netflix and can hear those whooshing motor sounds like I used to with my dad's old surround sound system when the series was live. Pretty cool since I never heard that on my regular TV.Size: I overdid it. Big TVs look small in the store and I got sucked into a bigger TV than needed. However, I don't regret it, especially now that I have a home with a much bigger living room. When I bought it, the room was about 12 x 15 and the first few days of watching made me nauseous. I got used to it quickly and now really like seeing everything without needing my glasses.I really like this TV and hope I won't need to buy another one to replace it for a long time.

I was always a fan of Samsung and love my 32 inch A450 but I was worried about the reflection that the Samsung's have, due to the glossy screen, as I have a family room with a lot of windows. The Sharp has a matte finish with no reflection so I have been very happy in that regard. The picture quality on this TV is very good when adjusted. It took me a little while to get the right settings for my room but now that I have it set the picture quality is great. After setting up the TV I had to upgrade the cables on my cable box as they caused the TV to be fuzzy (standard vga cables). Once I upgraded to component cables the picture quality of HD and regular was very noticeable. I have a PS3 and Apple TV and both look fantastic when running at 1080p. Even the Wii looks good but I will probably upgrade to component on the Wii in order to get higher quality. The 120hz works well even though I'm sure newer models are probably even better but I've been happy with the quality of football etc on this TV. The only area this TV could use help with is the sound. The sound is kind of empty but not bad for general watching. If you are big into sound quality you might want to check out other TV's but many LCD's are not great so external sources may be needed.I was able to get a great deal on this TV at another vendor, under Eleven Hundred dollars so for that price this Tv is fantastic as many Samsung and Sony 42 inch TV's with 1080p and 120hz are that price right now with. If you are looking for a TV take a look at Sharp, for the price and features they are very good.

Only a handful of stations are broadcasting true 1080 signals, and even then, most of the news clips, live hits, and archival footage are grainy. If my review sounds hyper-critical, that's simply because this TV's picture is so big and so sharp, that every minor flaw is magnified exponentially. When you see big screen TVs lined up in a row in large Big Box stores, you don't appreciate how big they are. This TV truly is massive. It feels like an elephant sitting in your living room. If I had to chose again, I would have bought a smaller and cheaper screen size, to hold me over until more channels adopt higher quality HDTV images.", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "GREAT !!!", "Author": "A.

Even though I paid little bit higher than Amazon, I was very happy about the deal. Because I also got a free blue Ray player, which is no longer offered by Amazon at the moment.It took me 20 minutes to set it up. I first used regular cable for signal, and the picture was not very impressive, not much better than my old projection TV.Next morning, I switched to video signal, picture is so great even regular channel. After breakfast, when I turned power on again, TV menue came up and dispeared just seconds. I unplugged power and replugged again, only green light was blinking. I google on-line and found lots of complaints about power failure of Sharp's LCD TV. I took it back to the store and waiting for new replacement.UpdateThe TV finally arrived on February 3, 2009. I have no complaint about this TV set so far. But I do have problem with the stand this time. The supporting post is not lined up with TV holes, so there is no way to put screws in. I guess the stand is for 46\" instead of 52\".UpdateI called Sharp technical support. They sent a local technician to my home two days after call. He opened the TV cover and adjust it to line up with the stand.
