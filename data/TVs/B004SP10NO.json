I had previously purchased an LG tv however it was 720p.  This Tv is GREAT! I love the Net Tv as it has podcasts that you can watch as well as Netflix, Pandora, Facebook etc.  Setup was a breeze.  Downloading and updating the software was seamless. Yes, I am technical however non-technical people should be fine too :-)Watching tv this way I am aware of the camera angles and I feel like I am right there experiencing everything with the actors.  I purchased this tv for our Master bedroom and it is the perfect size.  I did purchase a digital antenna so we could get the local channels for free and I also purchased a Roku.  The only thing this tv is missing is a Web browser.  That being said the picture quality is great and the Surround Sound is pretty good.  We have speakers in the bedroom from our previous living room set and hubby is taking his sweet time in hooking it up since the sound from just the tv alone is great.I definitely recommend this tv and I feel pretty pleased about my selection.  Trust that I researched the heck out of multiple tvs before choosing this one.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great set, Awesome display", "Author": "Marlon P", "ReviewID": "R3RJ78SXTGVP4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was at 1st reluctant to purchase this set, since I have always satisfied with Samsung products. But because of thesale at the time and its a 120hz system I jumped at it.Upon arrival it was very easy to handle, one person can handle this set very easily. Easy setup, the remote is a little confusing, but after 10 minutes I was breezing right along.The picture is awesome, I have Comcast hd and this set just pops with lively color, its truly remarkable.The sound quality is great, but i have a Onkyo surround sound system makes the sound stand out. The 120hz video makes gaming, I have no words to describe.I have not tried the other features, but am eager to try the internet feature. It has a built in WiFi or you can hardwire straight to it with an Ethernet connection.Phillips has won me, even though I still like Samsung products, I will still look at Phillips before I make final decision.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "good pic but lacks optical audio", "Author": "Caperie", "ReviewID": "R38F7EQH0ODLDT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far we like the picture and sound quality. However, did not realize that most sound bars and home theater sound systems are going to digital optical audio. Found a panasonic sound bar that uses hdmi, but better quality ones use the optical and do not have hdmi.  Also, be sure you have a high bite rate to use the tv connect. We only have 6 mbps and that is not enough to use the software. No app for Amazon video streaming or rentals.  Pandora is great as well as netflix.

I bought this mainly for PC gaming, along with the Netflix web app on the TV. I ignored CNET's review of this TV and took a risk. CNET's review was pretty much spot on, wish I would have listened.Good:-Net TV app with built in WiFi-120HzBad:-Terrible color reproduction-Hardly any picture options. In PC mode, you only have brightness and contrast. Everything else I had to force through my video card options. In TV mode, the options are still very limited. The main set up is for dummies and consists of 4 pictures asking which you like better. From there, you don't have much control. The colors looked washed out and the black levels are horrendous once you reach a decent brightness.-Blurry picture when connected to PC over HDMI. Even with correct overscan settings, pixel format, and TV set to PC Mode, the picture was terrible compared to a monitor. Everything looked like it had morphological AA applied and was not sharp at all like a monitor. Being that a big selling point of this is the wireless PC connect, I expected much better for PC monitor use.-Net TV app menus are slow to respond. Netflix mainly, selecting through the movies is a 1-2 second delay after you press a button.I sent this TV back already because I was not satisfied at all. The average user probably won't be disappointed but I have another 3 year old Philips TV and an Asus PC monitor to compare to. This TV's picture is terrible in comparison no matter what settings you try. If you are using this for PC use, I recommend you not consider this TV at all. I love my old Philips, but they let me down with this TV. The picture/performance is what I'd expect of a lesser brand marked $100 cheaper. You can do much better for the price of this set.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very, Very Good Value", "Author": "Southeastern Mass Customer", "ReviewID": "R8POXHYVL3FH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK so you can buy a Mercedes or you can buy a Honda. Mercedes has state of the art technology and my brother would love to sell you one for $110,000. You can spend $100 on a bottle of wine or get a $14 dollar bottle of Kendall Jackson. The Kendall tastes great, and is the Kendall Jackson of televisions. Yup I bought a $2000 Samsung for my work. But I bought this Philips for our home, and our family really loves it. We don't have cable, we get over the air digital signals. It's tuner is far stronger than the 26\" Olevia we're replacing. We get 32 channels in the Boston area with beautiful picture quality via our roof mounted antenna. We have a Roku and also use the internal set-based apps. The only reason we keep the Roku is that the TV doesn't have an internal Amazon app. We also have a DVD player and a Nintendo Wii(I try to hide all the peripherals..hate that stuff in the family room).The TV served us well during the Superbowl. Although it didn't help the Patriots to win, Tom Brady was crystal clear and the TV handled the sports motion very well. We chose an Amazon open box special (love those) for $405 and paid $3.99 for next day shipping. We're very pleased with the purchase,the price, the video quality, the apps and built in wifi. If you're not a TV brand snob (face it, we all have it within us), and like to getting a deal, this is a fantastic alternative.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "In response to criticisms regarding this model.  DLNA capable as well which most places don't mention.", "Author": "Zen \"Sometimes Zenophobic\"", "ReviewID": "R3CTP7LJWYM2E6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had my apprehensions about this model due to the mixed reviews I read from various review sites but when I saw this unit on sale during some Holiday web promotion with free shipping I ended up pulling the trigger and I'm quite satisfied and pleased with my purchase and would like to address some of the criticisms I've read on this unit which need some clarification:Picture / Image Quality:  Much better than I expected.  A lot of the criticism pointed at the limited controls but I found the existing controls more than adequate for adjusting the picture for personal taste.  If you end up hooking this LCD up as a computer monitor, then you don't even have to deal with the built-in controls if your graphics card or PC has its own image adjustment and color correction.1080p resolution:  Read a few reviews that say this only plays in 720p using media connect which is only true if you are connecting via wi-fi or using the VGA PC port.  If your computer supports HDMI out then you get full 1080p and no issues with Blu-Ray playback and I'm currently running it at max native resolution of 1920 x 1080 using the onboard HDMI video that is supported by the HD 4000 graphics built into my Core i7 processor.  I have 2 other monitors that are using my dedicated (discreet) Nvidia card.  Extremely impressed by how the Intel 4000 graphics is handling the Philips LCD.DLNA - This LCD is DLNA capable.  Whether this was made possible through the latest firmware update, I'm not sure but it's not made mention of on many product specs or descriptions.  I'm able to access all Shared folders on my Win7 Home network and able to use Windows Media Center streaming capabilities to have my PC control and send content directly to the Philips.SMART TV Capability - Not so impressed with how the controls work for Netflix and Youtube.  RW & FF through content is a pain and there is a noticeable delay in response times when using the remote controls.  If the main reason you want to buy this LCD is for the Smart TV apps then you're better off getting a regular LCD with great image quality and buying a ROKU or hooking it up via HDMI to a PC that you can watch Netflix or Amazon video in from a web-browser and just get yourself a wireless keyboard with trackball.  After plodding around trying to browse content on Youtube and Netflix and then dealing with the horribly slow FF & RW I ended up just switching to my PC HDMI input when I want to watch streaming video.  No Amazon video which sucks but I don't see why they can't add it later on with a firmware update - in fact, this set originally didn't have Youtube and now it does.  Has a ton of HD video podcast channels from sources that I've not seen on any other Smart TV or add-on box but with the same control issues as mentioned before - some you are forced to watch the entire thing from beginning to end.Overall, if you can get this thing for under $400 then why not?  Picture is great, I like the nice solid body and stand (this model being standard LCD and not a thin LED) and the PC and media connectivity features are the best part.  If your getting this for the Smart TV features then look to a Samsung or Vizio if  you can spend a little more or do the standard LCD + Roku combo if price is a factor.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent TV for the money", "Author": "David Haskin \"daviedog\"", "ReviewID": "R1WO5XHEK9T832", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for my kids for Christmas. It replaced a 21\" Sanyo that needed to go to the curb ;)First off the price for this TV was awesome, couldn't believe the deal I got. I'm more than pleased with the picture and the features. I have another Philips 47\" TV in my basement and honestly think the picture on it might be a bit better but I still need to tweak this set. The speakers on this TV are rear facing so you'll want to get this up on the wall for better sound projection or purchase a sound bar. My only complaint would be that the \"Net TV\" menus are pretty slow. They work great but you have to be patient for things like Netflix to fire up and once you're there don't expect to break any speed records.This is my second Philips TV and I've been more than pleased with the brand. They offer the same features as other vendors but for a much better price. My first Philips set is over 4 years old and hasn't given me a single issue.

My last TV was a philips and i didn't have any issues with that other than a blown speaker on the TV. The Net TV feature is nice but i don't see me using it much other than watching netflix on it. Blu-rays look amazing on this tv, the sound could be better but it is not bad overall. I plan on buying a sound bar for this once i can afford to.

I wanted a 40'at a deal and I got it. I wanted user friendly menu keys-got it. It is HD compatible-got it. I actually chose this product because it was different than some of its competitors, by having wireless capabilities. I figured since I do use my laptop often, it would be a great experiment to try to wireless project my laptop to the 40'. Well, downloaded the software from the Phillips cite, and it does not work. It wasn't a big deal, but I thought that this was the difference, amongst it TM, that influenced me to buy it.Also, it picks up secured signals very well, but not unsecured wireless signals. Maybe this TV has some hidden anti-virus protection that blocks connections to unsecured wireless networks.Of course, the audio is decent, but I tried to use the AV outputs from my Aiwa Stereo system. Maybe I'm too outdated, with my old equipment, but it will not disperse audio through the outputs when connected. Bummer! I guess I will have to upgrade the sound system and us the HDMI ports.
