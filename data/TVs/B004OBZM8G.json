Please try these settings for yourself and I promise you will be pleased.  If anyone can add to these please let us know.  I love the fact it is an LED TV. And this model of Sharp TV (632u), happens to be the most energy efficient of all LCD TV's this size. An estimated cost of $20. per year. Sharp's 6th generation LCD is at this time the most advanced LCD made on the market today. Sharp is making the screen for the Pioneer Elite series of TV's, the long time reference standard. LED TV's are not only more energy efficient but they are much thinner too. Aren't you glad that we didn't opt to pay extra for the \"240 Hz motion enhancement\" only to have to turn it off? That fact alone gives me a double feeling of satisfaction with this TV. I would like to know a lot more about the LED bulbs though. I wonder if anyone can tell me if the LED's  will last as long running at full lumens when compared to reduced lumens. (I believe they will)  I would also like to know the typical life expectancy of this TV. I believe it is typically 50,000 hours but I have no hard facts on this. Let us know if you can.

I was researching TV's non stop for about 2 weeks before I made my purchase. I went into American and Best buy, searched the internet top and bottom to find the best deal, on the best TV that I could find. I am the type of person that doesn't make a big purchase like this unless I feel that I am getting the best deal possible.I initially was looking at the \"Big Brands\" for LED TV's, Samsung and Sony. In the store, the picture on those TV's looked much better than the Sharp TV's that they had right next to them for comparison. I wanted at least a 55\", 3D I think is a fad, and was impartial to whether or not it had 3D capabilities, I feel that you lose production value with 3D, since the resolution is cut in half when you are watching it, plus who wants to wear 3D glasses when you're watching a movie at home on your couch. Leave it for the theatre where you get the full experience.After massive online research, I went with this Sharp solely because of the reviews that it had on Amazon, no one had a bad thing to say about it. And it was $500 cheaper than the 3D version of the 60\" sharp, and $800 - $1000 cheaper than a compareable Samsung or Sony! You don't realize how much you pay for that label on the front! The one thing that I was considering was a 240HZ over a 120HZ, but as far as picture clarity and smoothness, I feel that it does not make a noticeable difference at all. I can't wait to watch football on this thing.Out of the box the picture was beautful, easy set up with the stand, pretty self explanatory. I did notice some discrepencies with the picture, but the settings that are listed in the other review on here really fixed it and made it perfect. I saw some reviews complaining that the picture almost looked like a set on a movie and didn't look like an actual show. I noticed that myself, but found that it was easily fixed by displaying it in movie mode, and problem solved.You have to realize these are not your run of the mill TV's there so many extra settings for picture quality on this TV and you may need to adjust it for each show, sport, or movie that you are watching to get the picture correct. So anyone complaining about that, stop being a Simpleton, read some reviews and learn how to use your electronics that you just shelled out $1500, before griping about it in a review.You also have to realize that in stores, they make the less expensive TV's look like crap compared to the big brands that the markup is much higher on. Put this thing up against any Samsung or Sony on the market and you will not see a difference.I feel that I did get the best possible deal on a 60\" LED TV that you can get, I am very happy with this purchase, and if you are looking for the same. Buy this TV.Kudos to Amazon and their home direct shipping, their customer service people are a bunch of off shore foreigners, nothing against them, but they are just not that knowledgable, good thing their site functionality is top of the line and their home direct shipping is pretty legit too, everything went as explained and had no issues through the entire processThat is all.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sharp AQUOS 60\" LC60LE632U 1080p LCD/LED TV", "Author": "D.

Picture and experience out-of-the box was not that great though. With some tweaking, it can be made to perform great.Setup was easy enough. It even set things up on its own so that the PS3 could be controlled via the tv's remote. An initial bad surprise was that the cable box (AT&T;'s Motorola HD non-dvr box) was stuck on a single channel - could not get it to change either via the tv's remote or the regular cable box remote. Fiddling with the Link setup cleared that up.Programming the tv's remote to control the cable box also proved a problem. Need to get some more research time on that. Following the manual's instruction did not get that done.The main problem I had was with the quality of the picture. Things looked really weird, no matter which av mode was used. Colors looked unnatural, and the image appeared overexposed, making everything looked quite ugly. It did not help we have this 55\" Sony on the next room, which set the bar pretty high.Now for the good news. After downloading and burning the AVCHD calibration disk [..] After doing the basic calibration (the included HD Nation walk through is helpful), the image looked a LOT better. Some additional manual tweaking while watching a couple of movies (Start Wars episode 2 and Blade Runner) added the final touches. The image looks great, probably as good as it can get given the larger size of this tv. It compares well with the Sony, even if it it does not quite match it.Parameters used (may be personal, so your millage may vary):Backlight: +5Contrast: +30Brightness: 0Color: -7Tint: 0Sharpness: +2Color Temp: MiddleMotion Enhancement: OffFilm Mode: OffDigital Noise Reduction: OffA couple of controls can be set only via the remote:Overscan/image size: Dot by Dot - select it using the View Mode button on the remote.

This does not seem to stick well enough as well - needed to set it again a few times.Notice that the quality of the image mentioned above is in 1080p. Lower definition images (480p) still suck. That forced me to upgrade my Roku box in order to be able to get good image (older model was 480p only).

The delivery driver stays long enough to help unpack your new TV and to plug it in to make sure it fires up okay and has no obvious damage. Ours was fine.  Packaging is more than adequate so after screwing in the base plate I was able to lift the TV from the floor to the stand by myself no problem.It's a snap to input the correct cables to their labeled slots on the back.  Even the WiFi is EZ as it connects wirelessly to your home router using the hand held remote.  The 4 HDMI and 1 USB input jacks in the back are logical and ever so EZ to input.Sound speakers are adequate for everyday use. We send our audio out to our Pioneer 7.1 surround sound system so movies and concerts are as good as being there live. Wow!If you have problems with any of the TVs set up functions or if it ever needs repair, the unit will communicate with Sharp directly via the WiFi so their engineers can examine the situation and provide software updates.There are pre loaded apps like Netflix, Vudu, Blockbuster, Cinema Now, Aquos net and Napster.  Thru Vudu about 100 more apps are available free like FaceBook, Pandora and Twitter.  You can not however, go to your Email and access it online. Hopefully this will be possible soon.Adjusting the picture and sound is a breeze choosing pre set preferences or inputing your own. The deep black screen has no lighted areas and there is absolutely no blur during fast motion sports.All in all this television is about incredible Value.  Price and performance are outstanding.

Sabo \"Damgaard\"", "ReviewID": "RX3JFVAGXAJER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We first viewed a Sharp Aquos TV at Best Buy. It clearly stood head and shoulders over every other TV. Let me say I am a big fan of Sony and had their 1080P Bravia when it first came out (and paid through the nose for it). This TV makes my Bravia look like a dinosaur.The colors and sharpness are beyond anything I've ever seen in a HDTV.  We have now gone back and watched old movies on HDNET and they are strikingly more crisp and vibrant. From \"Chinatown\" to \"Ghostbusters\" the video quality is jaw droopingly improved.New movies are so crisp and clear it looks like you can reach into the screen and touch the actors. Video games and animated movies are amazing. The only drawback on video quality is that it \"dates\" recent movies too early. The effects are so obviously bad it has made us laugh (Matrix Reloaded) when we were awed by them on lower definition.Brightness is fantastic with the LED backlighting.Blu-Ray movies are...well...blu-ray movies. If you have blu-ray you'll be sufficiently impressed. If you don't have blu-ray...get it.This TV has tons of cool gadgets that connect directly via WiFi (which is really easy to set up).  We don't use the direct link to Netflix and other movie providers since we use our Apple TV for those services, but they are right there and easy to use.The only complaint I have on the TV is sound quality. It is \"tinny\" even with the bass turned all the way up, the \"bass booster\" turned on, and the treble turned down. The sound on my Sony was significantly better...and I do mean significantly. I have a good surround sound system so I can get the sound I want when I need it, but sound quality for every day viewing is a bit unimpressive. In all fairness I'm kind of hard to please with audio. My wife doesn't have a problem with it.All HDTV's are better than what we had, and the best thing about them is you never \"get used\" to the amazing picture quality (we haven't at least).  This one (and all AQUOS models I would presume) stand out in a crowd. You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value for the Price!", "Author": "T. Tozawa", "ReviewID": "R2WZXSNXZ5PH7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, a quick background ...A few years back I started off with a 26\" Samsung 720p LCD and shortly after upgraded to a 40\" Samsung 1080p LCD (LN40B530). After a DIY calibration I was extremely pleased with the picture quality. Mind you, I am not a hardcore videophile, but I do appreciate above average picture quality (if I were into pure picture quality I would just get a plasma.) My home theater setup is in a 12' x 12' in-law style unit so at 40\", the Samsung TV was more than big enough - but of course, after a while I wanted something bigger.Since the newer low to mid-end range of LED LCDs were coming down in price I started to look at some 55\" TV's from Samsung, Sony, and LG. Already having great experiences with my past Samsung TV's, that was the first brand I started to research. But it seemed like they currently have quite a few panel inconsistencies causing severe flashlighting and clouding (although I'm aware this is a main issue with edge-lit and/or non local dimming sets.) I've always loved Sony (back in the '90s), but nowadays, unless you get their top-of-the-line products, it seems like quality has gone down. In the end, the LG 55LW5600 seemed like the one to get. I never really tried or was a fan of LG but it gets great reviews and checking the 3D feature out at Best Buy, it seemed like a great TV.Then I came across this Sharp 60\" which was basically the same price for 20% more screen real estate (at the cost of 3D which I'm not interested in.) There weren't many specific reviews for this particular set and mainly relied on the reviews here. In general, Sharp isn't popular here in the States, but it's extremely popular in Japan. I know they make quality products so I figured I'd give them a try ... and I'm glad I did!Set-up was a breeze. After you power on the TV for the first time you go through a few quick steps such as determining whether it's for home or business (display model) use, and setting up the channels (Air, Digital, Cable), etc. You can always redo the initial setup from the main menu as well.Menu controls are easy to navigate and there's plenty of options for adjustments to cater to anyone's needs. My main uses are gaming and blu-ray movies, so the first thing I tested was gaming on my PS3. I was concerned about input lag (which is different from response time) and with out-of-the-box settings, there is a very noticeable lag. Of course, Sharp has their \"Vyper Drive\" gaming mode. Once I set the mode to \"Game\", input lag was near non-existent. I tested some games where timing is crucial such as Call of Duty, Street Fighter, and Hot Shots Golf and they played perfectly. I performed a few quick tests via PC to measure input lag in \"Game\" mode and averaged about a 30ms delay which I find is pretty decent for gaming. It's no CRT but at 30ms you really cannot notice the difference. If gaming is a concern I wouldn't worry about any input lag with this set!Next, I tested a letter-boxed blu-ray to check for flashlighting at the corners. Even with out-of-the-box settings, I didn't see any flashlighting or clouding issues during dark scenes. After I performed a DIY calibration of the set, the picture quality now looks amazing. Black levels are extremely good for an edge-lit and everything is nicely contrasted with excellent detail. Generally speaking, it's really not a great idea to copy another person's settings since the viewing environment will always be different -- but I'll share mine below for those who might want a starting point. Please note that my viewing is done in a dark room with ambient light from custom LED backlighting behind the TV.OPC [OFF]Backlight [-3]Contrast [+33]Brightness [-2]Color [-8]Tint [0]Sharpness [+1]ADVANCEDColor Temp:LowMotion Enhancement:Off (cannot be set when in game mode; default is off)Active Contrast:OffFilm Mode:Off (cannot be set when in game mode; default is off)Digital Noise Reduction:OffEverything else at default.After setting up the channels, I watched some OTA channels. HD channels came in cleanly and looked great. SD wasn't bad either. I only tested the OEM speakers for a minute or two and it was decent -- but built-in speakers are never great anyways. If you're buying a TV this large you should invest in an external sound system anyways. I personally hook everything up via HDMI through my Denon receiver and 5.1 Energy speakers so it's a non-issue for me.Wi-fi setup was easy but I didn't really experiment with the online features such as the apps since I can access most of those features like Pandora, Netflix, etc. on my standalone Sony blu-ray player. Upgrading the firmware took 1-2 minutes over wi-fi. After a few days of use I am extremely pleased with the set. You currently cannot find a quality 60\" like this for such a low price. I would definitely recommend this Sharp for anyone who wants excellent picture quality and value for a competitive price. Great for gaming, great for blu-ray movies.*NOTE*This was my first large electronics purchase from Amazon and was a bit curious about how the delivery process would be. I live in the San Francisco, Bay Area and Pilot Freight delivered my TV. I chose a delivery date when I ordered and got a confirmation email from Pilot soon after. I chose the 9am to 12pm time frame and on the day of the delivery the Pilot delivery people called me at about 9:30am to notify me that they'll arrive in about 10-15 minutes; and they did. They brought it in and asked me if I wanted them to set it up. I wanted to make sure it would power on fine and that there were no obvious defects so they assembled the stand and placed it on my TV stand and waited until I powered it up.

Overall, it's very good. Colors are GREAT, and picture quality is fantastic once you move the sharpness down to 0 (any more than that and the picture just gets dirty.)My big complaint is the terrible light leakage on the backlight. On a black screen, I have light blotches all over the tv. Two in the top right and bottom left corner, one on the top middle, and general unevenness on the center.It's not noticeable 95% of the time, but if the screen fades out, or a black videogame menu is up, it's very obvious and distracting.My second complaint is that the TV noticeably lags, even in Game Mode. It's not that big of a deal, my receiver has compensation, but to notice lip sync errors even in game mode is a problem.

From the store, I knew it was a decent size TV, had good color and brightness. After a couple hours of playing with the menus at home, I now realize this is the most advanced TV I've every used! Pleasantly surprised by (a) the menu interface, (b) the Netflix App, (c) the VUDU App (through which other apps can be accessed). The TV has more \"apps\" and internet connected gadgets than I list here, but I doubt they'll see much if any regular use by me.(a) The menu interface is smooth, and the TV image shrinks somewhat out of the way so you can keep watching while looking through menu options - very slick. The menu interactions are responsive to the remote buttons - no awkward delay (not just for the TV menu but for the apps as well). Connecting to my wireless WPA internet was a breeze.(b) The Netflix App is smooth and fully capable. I've used an inferior Netflix App on a Samsung BluRay player before, and never again. Since then I had always used an XBOX 360 for Netflix usage on the TV. Now with Sharp's built-in Netflix App (need only press a single button on the remote to get there) I have my new preferred Netflix device. The interface is fast and pretty fluid (of course can't be quite as animated as the XBOX 360 interface). The functionality is ALL there though - Recently watched items, browse instant queue, recommended to  you based on titles you've watched, new releases in categories, manage instant queue, episode descriptions, even audio and subtitle options! The streaming HD quality is excellent - very smooth - it may as well be an up-converted DVD or a BluRay as far as I can tell. The app capitalizes on the Sharp TV remote, using the play/pause/fast-forward/etc. buttons - an integrated experience.(c) It seems the VUDU app allows you to get to all sorts of internet media content. For the most part it seems like it uses RSS feeds for various sites to list content, but it is also host to some great web apps - including Pandora which has a fantastic interface as well (allows multiple user accounts, all functionality there). The VUDU interface reminds me of a stripped down Boxee media center with the tiles for apps. Basically, I use the VUDU app to get to Pandora.(d) Just thought of an item \"d\" - The TV can also play/display various media from either a USB drive (at least a thumb drive, but probably HDD too?) or from over the network. I tested music streaming over the network with my Windows 7 i5 laptop and it worked fairly well.Anyway - can't go wrong with this TV. It is the best bang for the buck out there right now.Other TVs have features you either won't use or won't ever notice. Don't pay for these! e.g.* 240 Hz - unless you are a hard-core gamer, 120 Hz is more than fast enough, even for sports TV. Going for 120 Hz instead of 240 Hz can shave at least $100-200 off the price point.* Sharp Quattron 4th \"yellow pixel\" technology (new this year) - red, green, and blue are the standard 3 pixels, and are so because they are the primary colors for light (any color can be made from various levels of RGB). The only way you'll notice this \"new yellow pixel\" is in your wallet getting thinner. Avoiding this \"technology\" can shave at least $200 off the price point.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for the money", "Author": "Know-It-All", "ReviewID": "R2F4U3UT4LSGE7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd TV in the 50\" inches screen size and my 4th LCD so I am pretty well aware of the attributes I am looking for. Having said that, it is pretty exiting stepping from the CFL back-lit LCD to the LED back-lit LCD screen. Picture is pretty much the same ..Nothing exiting there. These LED's are supposed to be easy on power consumption I hear,.. so I guess, that is the redeeming factor. Having brought up the power saving aspect of this TV, it has something called the OPC mode which basically adjusts the back-light based on the viewing conditions of the room. The sensor is located in the front of the tv and appeared pretty sensitive to the lighting changes in the room. However the picture seemed a little too dark for my taste and I quickly turned it off. After a little bit of tweaking, I could get the picture to my liking. The black levels are good,colors don't seem to bleed and the picture is sharp.On the second day, for some reason, the TV failed to see any input from the HDMI sources presenting a black screen. This lead me to call their technical support who picked up in 2 rings and professionally handled the situation and successfully resolved the issue which was firmware related.PC viewing is sometimes a challenge as the TV accepts only certain resolutions via the RGB else it lets you know that the signal is not compatible. I didn't have this issue with my other LCD's. Generally I duplicate displays with my PC and my monitor runs at 1400 x 900 which this TV dose not support. So that is a slight irritation.The remote control is flimsy and not user friendly at all. One button was sticky on mine. The layout has a lot to be desired.The TV has the capability to connect to the internet via  standard Ethernet or WiFi. Programming the WiFi is reasonably easy and you will need it for firmware updates and running the internet based apps like Netflix and so on.I have not tested out the audio as it is routed thru my receiver.

I tried the tweaks that are in a couple of the posts here and had moderate success with them.

You can achieve pretty much the same results with the modes provided by the manufacturer. I prefer Movie mode.

I don't have the problem with sound but I think it helps that I have it in a built in entertainment center so the speakers that face backwards reflect off the wall.

First of we wanted to get a 55\" Samsung or LG from best buy but i decided to just wait a little bit. Best buy had a few sharps in their home theater room, including the massive 80 inch. I could tell right away that the tv was not very well calibrated. I looked on amazon at some sharp tv's, came upon this one and for the price i knew i couldn't pass up on it. Even though it did not look very well at best buy but I did decide to take my chance since this tv had great reviews here. When I received it, i quickly calibrated to the settings the first reviewer posted and WOW huge difference. BIG thanks to the first poster for taking the time to acquire the proper settings. However I did leave the 120hz motion plus feature on because to me 120 does look better than the standard 60hz.I hooked everything up including the ps3 to watch HUGO on bluray and WWWOOOWWW the quality is just mind blowing. If you have this tv and you don't have a blu-ray player to go along with, than you are missing out BIG TIME. Xbox 360 and Ps3 games look great, however I think their is a little delay when playing games, not a huge deal, might just be me? Also i noticed with playing bluray on my ps3 that the motion is not 120hz even if i have the option on, feels like its a standard 60hz. Probably just the ps3. I do have a 17.8GBs high speed HDX1000 hdmi cable from Monster so my cable is more than capable of handling a tv this size.Another thing i noticed is that the speakers on this tv could be a bit better. They don't go as loud as i think they should. Considering its a $1500+ tv they could have put better speakers in. It's not like they are that much more expensive.

The only thing I can not vouch for is the wifi, cause we are not using it. Cat5 simply screams, so if you have the capability I suggest you run a cat5 from the router to the tv.

We checked everything and concluded that the HDMI inputs were not working at all. We called Sharp, and they walked us through a reset procedure. That seemed to fix the problem and the customer service rep told us we needed to install and update to make sure this problem didn't occur again. It worked well for 4 months and then we had the same problem.  We called customer service again and tried the reset again. This time it didn not work.  They tried to help us trouble shoot the problem and nothing seemed to fix it. They said they were going to send a new motherboard to replace it and send a local technician to fix it. We waited a month before we heard back bc they needed to order the part and we had to call and check on it.  Then it took two weeks for them to send it to the local technician and a week for us to schedule a time to have it replaced. The technician replaced the part and we were notified that if we have the same problem a thrid time Sharp would replace the tv. But by the time everything was resolved we only had 2 months left on the warranty and this problem occurred every 3-4 months so I knew we would be out of warranty if it did happen again. I told Sharp my situation and they said there was nothing they could do and refused to replace the television. Well not 3 months later, 1 month after our warranty expired, ALL 4 HDMI inputs aren't working again. I called customer service and the rep was very nice, but continued to tell me since we are out of warranty there is nothing they can do. He recommeded we call the tv repair company, but  we will have to pay it all out of pocket and then he told me that it might be better for us to buy a new tv, since this one has had so many problems! Seriously!! $1400 down the drain! I cannot believe they pushed replacing our tv off until our warranty was expired and now they say there is nothing they can do when I specifically asked for a replacement before my warranty expired because I knew this would happen again, and also if they had gotten the second repair completed in a timely matter, this probably would have occurred a few weeks before my warranty expired and I would have gotten the replacement.

Madsen \"jcmadsen\"", "ReviewID": "R1TLSJ5AKRHF5N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had been looking to replace my 7 year old 43\" Pioneer Plasma with something a bit more up to date. Something with more than one HDMI, slimmer, better clarity.  Also, I was ready for something substantially bigger due to the size of our current family room.  I came across the Sharp LC60LE633U by chance, and really liked the display.  I hadn't been in the market for a Sharp, bur after reading the online reviews, I felt it could be the HDTV for our family.Everything about this tv screams \"fantastic\" when taken out of the box (especially in light of the relative cost as compared to other 60\" LED/LCD systems).  The TV set up very easily, and had plenty of HDMI connections (4) for both the DirecTV and Blu Ray DVD boxes.  I love the look and slim design, as well as the interface.However, I do have a few complaints with the system, and they aren't minor.  First, the sound.  In a word - fuggedabadit.  You are going to definitely need a sound system with this.  My previous plasma had NO speakers, and I believe it's sound was superior to the speakers of the Sharp.  In fact, I'd put our iPad speaker up against it.  So, if you're hoping for out of the box, set up and get picture/sound that is workable, you're out of luck.Second, the picture.  I went with this system for several reasons (size, cost, 240HZ, contrast ratio), and there is just something...well...off.  For someone who really is into many, many, MANY settings, they will probably be able to tweak it to perfection.  I don't have that much time on my hands.  I really wanted something that look really good out of the box, and with some minor adjustments, became great.  Not to be, and that's really saying something in this day in age that you can't have a good picture with no adjustments.One of the first things you notice is that the system is set for the highest, advanced \"Film Mode\" and watching a BluRay DVD (in this case Last of the Mohicans) the movie looks as if it's shot on video.  It's quite disconcerting, and took me some time to figure out to set film mode to \"off\".  Why anyone would want it differently is beyond me.The next thing is color.  I've researched online individual with their preferred settings.  Some helped, some did not, but it's just too hard to get a picture right.  If it looks good on a movie, it doesn't on a sporting event.  Get it right for a sporting event, then a regular definition show, or a TV show, look wrong.  Sometimes, a tv show will look washed out, but the commericals will look great.  And so on.Reds look fuscia.  Greens look neon lime.  Blues are deep, but almost unnatural.  Again, I have played around extensively, but can't find that happy medium for all shows.  My family complains it's too \"dark\" compared to what we used to watch; when I attempt to brighten the picture, things become washed out. My older tv didn't have any of these problems.The biggest complaint is that if you sit across the family room, looking directly, the picture really does look pretty nice.  However, I sit in a chair that is slightly angled off to the left and slightly closer.  Suddenly, the picture changes.  I get the unnatural colors (especially blue, red, and green).  It's just...well, not right.I'm going to play around a bit more, looking for other settings.  With opening of the NFL this week, I want to give it a chance with the games (Go Lions!).  However, I have a feeling I'll be returning it and looking at other models.

I have many LCD tvs, including 32\" LED lit LCDs. This tv brings things to a whole new level. First: the size. At 60 inches, the tv quickly fills up a wall. The size offers an incredible movie experience. With my set up, the viewing distance is about 15ft. I wouldn't want anything bigger for this distance. Next, the clarity, definition, and brightness is incredible. The key to getting the best picture, however, requires much tuning. I would recommend researching recommendations on setting. Out of the box, the tv's settings are rather bland. Up close (within feet) there is some artifacting, but at viewing distance, it is minimal. The apps on this tv are another major plus. The Netflix app is easy to use, fast, and the picture looks fantastic! I haven't played around much with the other apps, but they seem pretty good as well. The sound is a little hollow and almost slightly delayed. I expected this, as it is a very thin LED lit LCD tv. All-in-all, I love the tv.

Sharp TV's are priced better or as good as most, and I think the Aquos are the best LED/LCD TV's. This set's picture was excellent right out of the box. The only adjustment I made was to the sound. The first day I watched the TV was a sunny fall day. It is placed in a south facing room mounted on a east wall facing west. At one point in the afternoon the sun was shining directly on the picture with no affect or glare. One of it's features is that it automatically adjusts the brightness of it's picture to the room's light. So it is brighter on a sunny day and will dim at night. Makes it so much eaisier to watch any time of the day. Another feature I noticed is that it holds the volume levels individually. In other words, watching a local broadcast at a low volume level, switch to watching a DVD that needs a higher volume, switch back after the movie is finished and the volume is not blaring! What a great feature! I am just beginning to build my home theater system so I am sure I will discover more great features, such as the Aquos link, which allows interactive control of more than one component with the TV's remote control. I am also glad I got the largest TV that I could afford, as the space where it is located is large enough that I could be more than twenty feet away from this set and the viewing is still great. I am not sure why the 70 inch version is nearly twice the cost as the owners manual covers both the 60\" and the 70\". I am also not sure what happened to the reviewer that had his TV fail after 9 months. Perhaps he wasn't using a surge protector. Always use a surge protector for sensitive electronics.

I looked around for a tv in their price range that was also fully stocked with features that they might use and was easy enough for them to actually want to use. This is how I came upon this TV. What was even better was that Amazon was offering a discount if I purchased it with a certain CC. How could I pass that up?The TV came in less then a week and the CEVA delivery guy helped un-pack and set up the TV just to make sure it functioned correctly.  For larger TV's its always best for them to check it for damage.The TV functions great with very vibrant colors, bright picture and fast response rate. The sound on it was also above average.I already had a 60hz samsung, and a 120hz sony LCD TV and even though it has the same refresh rate as the sharp, it is way more noticeable on this Sharp set. I can even notice it during commercials, which I never saw on the Sony. its like looking at real life, almost better then 3-D, I don't think 240hz would be that much of a difference from this.I use the WI-FI available on the set to view Netflix, which works just as good on my xbox as the TV. It also has a ethernet port but I had no need for it. A great plus for the TV is that now with internet connectivity, you can receive updates for the TV as soon as they are available, they come up as pop-up screens while the TV is on.The only negative I can think about the TV is that the menu is VERY difficult to navigate.

I currently have a 4 year old Vizio 55\" LCD which far out performs this model...hands down.I could not get the colors right...they always seemed red or pinkish, no matter what I did to the controls...and yes I tried the advanced settings.I have read critiques regarding high motion blur,  I did not experience that, but I found whilst not being 'jerky' , the motion on regular scenes did not seem to flow as well as it does on my other TV's (one of which is another Sharp).The apps were easy, although I found the Netflix picture to be way better via my Roku than through the direct app.As for the remote, I hated it....mainly because to scroll through inputs is a real pain. Why do you have to go through them all when really all you need is the HDMI options ?I honestly thought with all the new technology that has come along since I bought my Vizio,that I would see a vast improvement with the Sharp. I was wrong.What really turned out to be a nightmare was returning the thing. A week after my first call to Amazon I was still waiting for pick up, so I called again...another 5 days passed and nothing. So I called again, this time the agent got the carrier (Pilot) on the line and after he spoke with them he transferred me. They then came on the line and said they would pick it up that same afternoon.Imagine my surprise when an older guy arrives, on his own, with what looked like an elderely Mother in his passenger seat.I explained as I have my leg in a splint that I couldn't (and why should I?) help him. He said in that case I would have to call Pilot again and request another pick up as he was not expecting such a big TV.....well HELLO !!!... if it was a 32\", Amazon would have shipped the thing Prime....that's why they need Pilot in the first place !! Anyway, long story short, I asked a neighbor to help him out, rather than rebook it. But I was horrified when he refused to take the packing material I had saved and just shoved it in the back of his truck unprotected. It made a mockery of me keeping the set safe in a unused closet prior to pick up, so it wouldn't get damaged !!!!!So to conclude, average TV, LOUSY shipper.

I recently purchased it for my brother at bestbuy for $1399. Sure, if you've never seen a high-def tv with bluray signal before then yes it should wow you, but if you've been exposed to a good high-def tv like the 60in KURO, then you can see that the quality if this tv is really crappy. Color rendition is out of whack; if you like the film grains, well then tough luck 'cause the picture quality of this tv is so smooth everyone has baby skin. Sure it's cheap, but for a true HD experience, you're  really missing out if you think this is the Holy Grail of HD television. You will notice a a lot of compression artifacts in this tv for bluray movies, don't ask me why. I suggest getting one of those 50in panasonic plasma  instead.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,799.99", "Features": "It has 60-Inch class (60-1/32 inches diagonal) display with full HD 1080p (1920 x 1080) resolution\nNetflix, CinemaNow, and Vudu streaming video, customized Internet content, and live customer support via built-in Wi-Fi\nEnjoy music, video, and image files from USB thumb drives and networked DLNA-certified devices\nUltraBrilliant LED system uses \"double-dome\" light amplifier lens\n120Hz Fine Motion Enhanced for smooth and detailed fast-motion picture quality", "Name": "Sharp AQUOS LC60LE632U 60-inch 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZujoCI1LL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004OBZM8G"}}
