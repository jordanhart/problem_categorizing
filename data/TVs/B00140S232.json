{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Really Nice LCD TV - good beginner - budgetminded", "Author": "microeconomics", "ReviewID": "R1CPOUXWUA1NM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the TV after not knowing a lot of details about the model. It seems like Toshiba was purposefully not publishing the specs. I would imagine not to hurt its regza sales. Although Regza's I think have 14bit processing and 3 HDMI ports. But then again all have 8 bit screens ..... It looks like the details have the screen res at 1366 x 768, with a response time: 8 ms.I did notice that it does come with 10bit processing - this is a selling point for some other TV makers. So I bought it a bit on chance - plus it was available for amazon prime shipping. Big plus to have it here in two days. Without extra cost. I also live in CA - so no sales tax (At least from amazon :).The TV has enough inputs for me. 2 HDMI are good for all I need - and the sound is really solid. It is pretty thin and looks nice with the piano black frame. I have only had it for a couple of days - so hard to say much more.The picture looks fantastic when hooked up to HD Source (computer or HD antenna). Fired up half life 2 - lost coast and it looked great too - no ghosting that I could see - flawless game play visually.I will update as I play with it more. No cables in box (but it does come with a power cord). Remote is actually very usable (but it will sit). I have a Tivo HD - and that works with the first remote code. The Tivo HD hooked right into the HDMI port and works perfectly to max res out of the gate. It wanted to go 1080i -but I put it back down to 720p. I may change that ....Also - the base is not adjustable. So make sure you have a good solid surface at approximately the viewing height you want. Or you will have to  wall mount it ... :)Overall - very pleased. Great quality tv (as far as I can tell) for a good price.", "Date": "March 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great picture.

Luckily when it's turned off and back on it usually comes on okay. Personally I don't think one brand is really better than the next for reliability purposes. The newer tv's just break easier. My suggestion is, if you plan on keeping a newly purchased tv for a long time, get a service agreement.  I'm one of those people who NEVER buys a service agreement, but for tv's I would reconsider that.Original Review: I looked at a lot of tv's before I bought this one. It had a picture closest to the top end tv's but a reasonable price. I bought it in a local store and was able to get the box in the back seat of my economy car and drive it home without a problem. I am SO impressed with the clarity of the Hi-Def picture, along with pretty good sound. The sleek black \"frame\" makes the picture look even better. This one is a no-brainer.  I haven't owned it that long; if any issues arise, I will update my review.

Ordered from Amazon on Thursday and it arrived Monday. What service! The Hi Def channels are great clear crisp and bright. I did not connect the set to my HD cable box. The auto tune picked up 26 digital channels directly from cable. I don't think I'll bother with a cable box on this set unless I decide I would like to watch the encoded channels. SD is good and about what you would expect. Sound is good, perfect for a bedroom. The remote and menu set up is simple and intuitiveThe price is very competitive and good value for the money. At this stage I am pleased with the purchase.I would recommend this set to anyone looking for a 32 inch LCD TV at a reasonable price", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Better than expected - great value", "Author": "W. Robertson", "ReviewID": "R3IXEOEVPB3PYZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to my local electronics store, planning to buy the Sharp LC32SB24U rather than this Toshiba. The sales person suggested, before buying, I do a side by side comparison view of the Toshiba 32AV500U and the Sharp LC32SB24U.  The Toshiba was $40 more than the Sharp, and I figured it would be the typical upsell.But comparing the image quality of the Sharp and Toshiba, the Toshiba won hands down.  The Sharp definitely had a more \"washed out\" look, while the Toshiba picture was more vibrant with blacker blacks and greater contrast.  I doublechecked that both sets were tuned to the same HD source, etc.  Anyway this demo was enough to (up)sell me and I bought the Toshiba.  It has been great.This unit is for the bedroom and I don't regret getting the 32\" instead of a 26\".I didn't know much about QAM tuners before buying, but what that means is that I can connect my Verizon FIOS cable directly into the TV (no converter box) and receive digital TV channels, some HD channels, and all the digital music channels, all without needing a converter box.  Obviously with a converter box you get a better user interface (onscreen interactive program guide) and many more channels, but for the moment I am happy using the TV with direct cable connection (no converter box) and saving a few $ per month.HD picture quality is so much better than regular digital TV -- if you go to the expense of buying an HDTV (like this one) you really need to hook it up to receive HDTV or you are missing a whole lot.I am not a videophile or audiophile but have to say that I would recommend this Toshiba very highly to anyone looking to spend between $600 and $700 for a 32\" HDTV.", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "HDMI PROBLEMS...", "Author": "HERE WE GO STEELERS!!! \"GL\"", "ReviewID": "R2P65E0HIR7JVO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this tv based upon the reviews I read here...great start hdtv for the $$.  The set worked great for about 2 weeks then I started having problems with the HDMI connected components.  The cable tv hdmi connection would often have a \"No Signal\" response on the set and this would only be corrected by turning on the second HDMI component (a dvd player).  Seems like there is a serious problem with the HDMI board.  In any case, after a couple months, Toshiba replaced the HDMI board (under warranty), but sadly (after a 25 day repair time-frame), the same problem ensued.  Basically, I'd be cautious buying this set if you plan to plug in more than one HDMI component.  Great picture and decent sound when it is actually working.I've decided to update my review, because after months of talking to Toshiba and having my TV in a repair shop, I've finally gotten some answers from the real tech gurus out there.  I learned that the HDMI issue that I had with this TV was not related to the TV itself but to the HDTV cable box provided by Comcast, go figure.  Comcast is apparently working on a software update that will allow the HDMI connection to work properly, but they haven't fixed the problem yet....no surprise there, and I wouldn't expect any upgrades soon.", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "A Good Deal!", "Author": "E.

The problems I have had so far are: no picture at all (just sound), the picture jumping on the screen, the sound going funky, and also just a static over the top of the picture. The only way to fix any of these problems is to turn it off and unplug all the cables and replug them in. I don't know why unplugging the cables works but it does every time. It will usually last a week or two before the next mess up but who wants to keep unplugging cables all the time? Very annoying.

It's had this problem for at least a year now. Power-cycling usually helps. Either way, not a bad TV, but I'm done with Toshiba.I've had this TV for about a month now. I watched the Red Wings win the Stanley Cup in HD a few weeks ago, and it was probably the sharpest sports broadcast I've ever seen. Colors look great and the blacks are pretty close. The built-in speakers are acceptable compared to some other off-brand 32\" models, and are not too tinny or fake. The warm-up takes 5-7 seconds and the lag between channels is about a second. I have analog cable tv so this may vary with your results.The only problem I've had with this is the VGA input from a computer. Depending on your use, this could be a big trade off. I have a Sony SZ laptop, one of the best ones they make. If I input the signal from the Sony, I can see a square develop in the upper-right corner of the tv that's about 7 inches wide and 4-5 inches high, which will disappear after a few seconds. This happens frequently if I play an AVI movie fullscreen, but if I burn that movie to a disc and play it on my Philips DVD player through the composite inputs, it looks fine with no squaring. It should be noted that I played 'Gears of War' (PC game) and it didn't exhibit this problem. I also see it if I scroll vertically through a webpage quickly, but only for a split second.In summary, I'd give this Toshiba 3.5 stars overall, and round up to 4. I really don't watch much tv which will probably be its intended use among purchasers here. The VGA problem is extremely annoying, but I mostly use it for stock trading/reading articles on the internet. Also I plan on giving the tv away to a relative when I leave the US later next year, so no big loss. But if I had to do it over again, I'd probably pay a little more and get the 32\" Samsung. I did a search and found two other people with this same problem, so I don't think it's an issue with my PC or its configuration. If I had an HDMI or S-Video output on my laptop (I don't), I could try those instead.", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "First Timer LCD/Flat-Panel", "Author": "B.B.Rich \"bbrich57\"", "ReviewID": "R1LE11TPABV2MM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Last week our <4 yr old 32\" Panasonic CRT set decided to stop working for some unknown reason. Though not exactly in our budget, we were forced to buy a new TV. It was time to upgrade to an LCD flat panel.To make a long story shorter I was looking at the Sonys and the Samsungs when my wife spotted this Toshiba.The good:1) \"By today's standards\" the price was right. A lot of bang for the buck... so far.2) It has multiple inputs for my older components as well as room to upgrade to newer ones, plus3) The picture looked great.4) It weighs less than 30lbs, a far cry from the CRT set it replaces. I can handle this one by myself.5) Glare has been a problem in our home. This set has completely eliminated that.6) Not a nice wood veneered cabinet, but the I have to admit that I like the piano black finish much more than I thought I wouldThe bad: (C'mon. You knew it was coming.)1) I don't want to have to turn on the amplifier every time I watch the evening news, so I have to say that the built-in speakers leave a lot to be desired, even for TV built-ins.2) I found the set-up to be challenging. It took me a few days to come up w/settings I could live with.3) As one who remembers the \"instant-on\" TV craze it seems to take an unusually long time for the set to decide whether or not it will light. The Panasonic's (CRT) amplifier would come on almost immediately followed by the picture. When powering up this set, nothing at all happens for about 10 secs. It acts like an old tube set from the '60's. Is that normal for these?That's about it, both the good and the bad as I see it so far.

I turned it on and was so excited since the picture was beautiful.  However,. I only have an antennae--no cable or satellite.  I pressed the Channel Guide and...it gave me a \"Not Available\" message.  Not Available?? Surely, I thought I must not be pressing the right button or, perhaps, have not set up the TV correctly.  I mean, my Mitsubishi DLP has a Channel Guide using an antennae.  Heck, even my old CRT TV had a Channel Guide when I added the converter box!  But sadly, no, the Owner's Guide states \"Displays the channel guide in the CABLE/SAT mode.\"Yes, you can use Favorites, the Channel Browser, etc., but if you want to find out what is on a particular channel through an antennae and how long it is scheduled for, you have to go to that channel and press \"Info\".  No clicking on a Channel Guide, finding a show you like and then clicking to get switched to that channel.  Perhaps they did not know that large metropolitan areas would get between 40 and 50 digital channels over the air.If I would have known this before I bought it, this would have been a deal breaker for me.  Yes, you can fault me for not reading the Owner's manual more carefully, but who the heck would think a CRT TV with a converter box would have more funtionality then a digital TV!Too bad I gave my CRT to my brother--yes I would prefer it to this TV!  Thankfully, this is only a \"second\" TV for back up use.  I guess I will have to print out program schedules from the internet every week and keep close at hand.If I have have misunderstood something about this TV, and someone would like to tell me how to get the Channel Guide to work with an antennae, please blast away!

My Digital Cable box (Time Warner) is connected via a HDMI cable.  Non hi-def stations (like Comedy Central) look wonderful (and every bit as good, if not better, than my old set).  This Toshiba includes a \"DNR\" setting (Digital Noise Reduction) which cleans up standard def sources.

It does, but I doubt most people will be bothered by it.  It takes 5 to 7 seconds.One caveat.  The factory presets on this set aren't ideal.  The blacks were slightly washed out and flesh tones a little too orange for my liking.  But after going through a THX Optimization (available on every Disney DVD), it looks great.

My experience with Amazon over the past six months, with numerous products, is that Amazon intentionally delays shipping products that qualify for \"free shipment\", probably in an attempt to generate shipping fee income.  This may produce some income, but it is very poor customer service.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "Kim Marie Mcallister \"mistiejourney\"", "ReviewID": "RZX3TJS5LO05", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great picture, no problems - I'm very pleased with this television.

I had to call Amazon to set up another delivery of the same TV in order to return the damaged one. So if you hear \"popcorn sounds\" inside the TV, please don't accept the delivery!Luckily, Amazon was very quick on shipping out a replacement order and in less than a week, I have my new TV in my room and the damaged one picked up by Amazon.Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase; I just wish I didn't have to go through all that trouble.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "daughter loves it", "Author": "Richard Mcburney \"Richard\"", "ReviewID": "R2NJ2KMCJNMZ7U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got this as a gift 4 my daughter,she loves it,says it has a great picture", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "TOSHIBA KILLS SANTA", "Author": "L.

Should you have any concerns about what may happen when or if you tv breaks, this is the chaos and frustration you will find in dealing with them.  Please go with a different brand...We bought a TV/DVD combo from Toshiba as a gift from Santa last year for my 8-year old so that she could watch her Full House and Lizzie McGuire movies on it in her bedroom. Unfortunately, after 4 months, the tv's picture stopped working. She told me to send it back to Santa, so off it went to our local authorized Toshiba repairman, as you cannot return these items to Amazon after a certain period of time. We were told by Toshiba that the tv was under full warranty for parts and service. The repairman said no. We would have to pay at least $80 in service repairs. Well, it's been six months and we have yet to see our tv. The part that was supposedly broken was out of stock. Toshiba has sent out part after part after part...spending more in shipping and parts I'm sure than we actually paid for the tv. Now they are shipping out their 4th part...and we still have no tv and it's November. NOTE: the Toshiba representatives were rude and their supervisor (Dave Thomson) was scripted and condescending.  TOSHIBA DOES NOT STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT AND DOES NOT HELP ITS CUSTOMERS.My daughter got so upset that Santa didn't return her tv that we had to buy her another tv a few months ago. Then, she overheard one of the numerous heated discussions between my husband and Toshiba. Every time my husband called, we were told the issue would be \"escalated\". The representatives are scripted and said whatever they could to passify us.  In the end, we were told by Toshiba's supervisor (Dave Thomson) that this was their final decision...to just continue to keep trying to fix an inferior product with no hope that it may get fixed.  By the time we get the tv back, if we get it back, it will no longer be under warranty.In the end, with no return of her original tv and the numerous phone calls to/from Toshiba, my daughter finally got the clue and realized Santa doesn't exist. Thanks Toshiba. MAY NO PARENT EVER RELY ON YOUR PRODUCT AGAIN! THE TECHNOLOGY IS LOUSY AND YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AN EMBARRASSMENT! GIVEN HOW TIGHT CONSUMERS' WALLETS ARE THIS SEASON, I HOPE PEOPLE LOOK PASSED YOUR BRAND AND SELECT A BETTER CHOICE.FYI...When we purchased the tv, it was not made clear to us that it would be outdated within 14 months with the switch to digital.Happy Holidays from a very dissatisfied customer.", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00140S232"}}
