{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works well; Dvd easy to use; good closed captioning", "Author": "IcePatrol", "ReviewID": "RPJSNS15XH51Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this for my elderly parents, who wanted a small TV for the kitchen, which would not be hooked up to cable.  They were very happy that the closed captioning worked well (even with the more limited reception that they had BEFORE using the boosted DB4 antenna, which received many more channels).  Since they live more than 25 miles outside of Washington DC, their handyman tried several antennas and ended up placing a DB4 in the attic.  They were able to receive more than 60 channels after that.  My mother told me that the slot loading Dvd player is very easy to use.  We ordered this directly from Beach Audio, since I was familiar with them from a prior experience and the rep was very helpful on the telephone.  I subsequently noticed that Beach Audio was an Amazon Marketplace seller for this item as well.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sansui LED LCD TV / Combo", "Author": "J. Koenig \"jkoenig24\"", "ReviewID": "R2GQW31PPKI9YE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a gift for a senior citizen friend. She was thrilled when, upon insertion of a DVD, this unit switched and started playing the movie immediately. No monkeying trying to get the correct settings. Picture is great and the sound is fine. I had the few connections made and unit set up for her cable provider in very short order. This is a light weight unit; about 10 pounds for a 22\" screen. It doesn't take up much more room than the 19\" CRT TV set it replaces. I'm considering buying a second one to mount in my camping trailer!", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sansui 24\"", "Author": "Mick_B", "ReviewID": "R23IWPG3QSQXAK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought the tv/dvd combo for the kitchen & was impressed by its clarity & color.
