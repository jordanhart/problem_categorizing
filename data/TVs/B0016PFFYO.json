This is my second HDTV LCD panel but my first in a larger size.This unit packs a lot into a nice package for a really nice price.  If you're looking for something just one notch below premium (i.e. a great set with great value) then buy this set.  Don't be thrown by the price; this TV looks great and performs superbly.720p at this screen size is perfect.  1080p below 42 inches is wasteful feature bloat that you don't need to pay for.  High Def channels look phenomenal on this set.  XBOX360 over component is terrific.  My HD feed is fiber optic.  I have not tested over-the-air reception of this unit yet.Standard Def (regular TV) is very good compared to what I've seen on other sets in stores and at friends' houses.  The internal signal up-converter is solid.  DVD over component hookups looks very nice.Display adjustment options are extensive.  Some tweaking is needed out-of-the-box but this is very easy to do, and you can look online (AVSForum is great) for help in this arena.ClearVoice sound (emphasizes dialogue over sound effects & music) is a great option and works well.The internal speakers are surprisingly decent if that's all you have.  They have very little bass, but the mid-range sound is fairly full.  We have a small 2.1 speaker system that we will use, but I haven't yet felt compelled to hook it up while we get the sighting and wiring runs finalized.The biggest problem I had with TV was getting the stand attached.  Once I got that sorted out, the rest of setup was a breeze.I paid more money than this set is listed for here, and I'm still thrilled with my purchase.

Lepadatu", "ReviewID": "R2WMA92W0OK8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this one a couple of days ago for $600+taxes. For some reason, both I and my wife thought there was something wrong with it, very good image quality but somewhat dim for our tastes - in all fairness, we still watch many channels in standard or digital definition.So, we bought a better one, a Samsung 37'', 1080p, NC550... According to all reviews, it was supposed to be better, a lot better, it was a 1080p for God's sake!. And, as we soon found out, this one was not \"dim\" by any measures!I have calibrated the LG (do a search on google), and tried to do the same thing with the Samsung but I could not find any websites with the needed calibration information. I tweaked the settings on Samsung for hours on end. After 6-8 hours of watching both TVs, side by side, on a variety of channels (HD, Digital and Analog - I have not tried to hook them up to my laptop, though nor played any games on them!!!), the decision was somewhat easy. Incredibly, unexpectedly, the LG (37'', 760p) was significantly much better than the Samsung (37'', 1080p etc.). The image was much clearer and warmer, more pleasant to the eyes, the faces on both SD and Digital signals much clearer, more... \"acceptable\". On an HD signal alone, we could not see any significant difference at all (again, we both liked the LG but it was just an a preference by now!). We watched both of them, the same channel, the same cable signal, at the same time ... I know it sounds incredible, but we both liked the LG more.The price was not an issue, the Samsung was just a $100 more (at Brandsmart USA). I was totally surprised: I thought the Samsung would blow us away (it was SAMSUNG, 1080p!!!. 5th generation after all), but it so turned out that the image on the LG was way much better. My wife kept telling me: I like the LG more, but if you think Samsung is better, then it is up to you! It took me hours to finally give up a \"better\" TV, the Samsung (1080p), for the LG (720p), but I did it. Now, when we watch TV (LG), we love it!I have my doubts, but I am open to the remote possibility that some \"calibration settings\" on the Samsung could offer an image equal or even better in quality than the one on LG. I would be very, very, very surprised though...We've also had a Plasma, 42''. Hitachi, TV in our Living room for 2 years now. Excellent TV, on all signals... The LG is not \"better\" is a bit different...I suggest that you buy two of the Tvs you like, bring them home, set them up in the room you like, watch them side by side, and THEN decide. Otherwise, you don't know how good (or bad) your TV is! What you watch in the showroom and EVEN THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS are only an INDICATION of what your TV would look like to your own eyes in your own room.All the best!", "Date": "November 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "K.Su \"Dr. Sylar\"", "ReviewID": "RIIAHMIH016IP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having the 37LG30 for 2 weeks now, I think it is one of the best HDTV in its class.

I did not compare this unit with the Samsung LN37A450 (or with my own Samsung LCD for that matter) but I'm sure you can't go wrong with either model.  The LG was $150 cheaper at the time of purchase, so price was somewhat of an influence.  If you're going to buy an LCD tv and have room for a 37-inch, I definitely recommend it over a 32-inch.

This thing looks awesome in my living room too, just sitting there.  This LG is perfect if you don't feel the need to waste extra money on a TV that has a high-end brand name (Sony, Panasonic, etc.) and you just want a nice TV.  My boyfriend kept telling me I should spend an extra $200 and get one of those high-end TV's but I'm really glad I didn't.  I like mine much better than his Panasonic.

The stand is a pain to install. Make sure that u have really good, thin handled phillips screwdriver handy otherwise you will have to do what i had to,  go out and buy one for the occasion.  I chose LG because the picture looked better on this tv than to other comparable make and models.  I was actually very shocked that it out performed  brands that cost almost twice as much.  Fast scenes showed up great (some HDTVs has some problems with blurring on fast paced scenes) the menu is so easy to use. It really is a very user friendly tv. If you were like me and have a hard time deciding between the 720p and the 1080p  HDTVs keep reading.Like most of you i went out and did my homework on buying my HDTV. At first i was hell bent on buying one that was 1080p and so i refused to look at any 720p tv. Then i went into a store and they had both the 720p and the 1080p lg tvs right next to each other. as i compared the 2 side by side i could not tell the difference between the 2. Like most of you who have been doing the same thing as me,  it really confused me.  I thought that the 1080p should have been alot better. So i went back home and researched more.  Then i found 2 articles on-line, one on c-net and the other consumer reports and both said that it is not the resolution (IE 720p 1080p) your looking for, it is more the contrast, brightness, and black levels you need to look at.  In other words, you pick out HDTV's exactly the same way you would if u were buying a standard tube since once u cross over to HD there is not a noticeable difference between the resolutions even with blu ray.", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Gorgeous Picture!", "Author": "Joe \"Sidecreek\"", "ReviewID": "R1IKHEFAN30YXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was torn between this TV and a Samsung LN32A450, although the Samsung was smaller that was not the reason I selected the LG. Both models were side by side in the store (yes, I bought at a store and not from Amazon - fear not, Amazon gets enough of my money!) and the pictures looked great on both, but, the LG seemed a little sharper and brighter in my opinion.I have this plugged up to my PS3 and the Blu-Ray movies look awesome! The games look great as well and no \"blurring\" that I can tell in fast moving scenes (this LG has a 5ms response time.)Although the TV is 720p output you could not tell the difference between 720p and 1080i/p on a set this size. Good rule of thumb: 40\" lower 720p is fine, larger than 40\" 1080p is needed.Compare the specs to other TV's for yourself but, a 12,000:1 contrast ratio and a 500 cd/m\u00b2 for this price is a no-brainer!

The sound on a regular channel is okay but not great, once you get to an HD channel forget it, the sound bottoms right out.You can turn the volume to 100% and still miss dialogue even with the clear voice option on (and yes I've had my hearing checked, its fine.)Maybe I'm being picky but I have a Samsung 40\" and the sound on that tv is great nothing more needed. I will need to get a surround sound system for the LG to be able to enjoy it more and hear it when I'm more than 3 feet away.Overall the money saved in getting this model balances things out.

(32\" seemed too small and 40\" too large).  There's no reason to waste the money on 1080p for this size.  I wanted to purchase a well-respected brand and kept my eye on Samsung and Sony TVs for quite some time.  I actually ordered a Samsung A330, but then received an email from the supplier stating the TV was out of stock.  The other Samsung and Sony models were $800 or more, but I only wanted to spend $700 or less on a TV.  I started to consider looking into other brands, which I am glad I did.  After reading the reviews from several sites, I settled on purchasing this TV for $650.  With no tax or shipping costs, it was a better deal than anything you could find in a store.  The shipping was fast and the delivery man placed the TV in my living room for me.  Putting the TV together wasn't difficult.  I wasn't very happy with the picture at first, but spend a couple of minutes to calibrate the picture settings from recommendations online and it will do wonders!  I couldn't be happier with this TV and I can't believe I waited so long to buy one.  Now my boyfriend will actually come over to my house and not complain about watching movies on my TV (he has a 40\" Sony 1080p).  His TV cost about $400 more, but I definitely wouldn't say that his TV looks that much greater than mine.  Yes, as others have mentioned, the volume does need to be turned up more than you would expect. You can't completely blare it, but who really needs that anyway.

Robinson \"Researchoholic\"", "ReviewID": "R33S7SK60GX5A0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, let me tell you that I did weeks of research when I decided to purchase a new TV. My viewing distance is approximately 10 feet so I decided to get a 37 inch versus a 32 inch. Good choice although it took a few days for my brain to accomadate all that stimulation since I used to watch a 27 inch CRT. The inputs and outputs are more than adequate with 3 HDMI, 2 component ect...  The remote is fine aesthetically and it is simple. Assembly  of the base was super simple so I don't know how others that reviewed this TV interpreted the instructions. Now for the picture. Standard definition on this set looks fine. Some channels worse than others but overall tolerable and the difference eventually goes unnoticed. However, the High Definition looks spectacular as well as DVD's. Most of my TV watching is through a cable box with HD capabilities. The picture settings (color) can be easily adjusted with presets or you can get super-customized if you wish. You can really fine tune this thing. I have not used it as a computer monitor and likely never will. The sound is cool because the voice technology is very evident. There are no visible speakers because they are cut under and behind the set. The sound is stragely ambient and is slightly dull. I run my sound through a Bose 3-2-1 system so I do not need to tolerate any sound impurity. Lastly, for the price range you can't go wrong, with all the inputs, the customization options and the refresh rate is 5ms!!! There is a 5 second wait to power on once you press the power button. Oh yeah, one more thing, there is no noise what-so-ever when the TV is on except for the sounds you should hear.

It was a nice HDTV. Plus, it was a limited edition. Still, I just could not help thinking about the negative overall ratings that the Vizios were getting. Everywhere I looked, I saw reviews and comments on the TV. The majority were negative. I was thinking that I would eventually have problems with the TV. Plus, I did not like the fact that when I played Madden 2009 for my PS3, the players were very blurry. Prior to the snap, you could just see how blurry the helmets were. It was just very noticable. I did not like it. Then, while passing, the players were totally blurry. This changes, once the camera comes a little closer. I hated that. I bought a Vizio HDMI cable and it cleared up a little, but not much. Overall, I figured that this was not a good gaming TV. That was a red flag, in itself.Prior to even getting this TV, I continuoulsy noticed how the LGs, Sonys, and Toshibas were getting good reviews and ratings. I decided to buy the LG because it was reliable and more affordable than a Sony. Plus, my Grandmother has one. I was impressed with it. I payed $598.88 for the HDTV, at BrandSmart. I have noticed that LG seems to make good products. I have an LG Voyager. It is a great touch screen cell phone. I also have an LG bluetooth.Anyway, this is a really good HDTV. The picture is very vivid and colorful, especially when watching on HD channels. You wouldn't know that the TV is a 720p. With a Philips HDMI cable SWV3534 6 ft High speed, it steps the picture up to a 1080p. My wife even noticed the difference. If you don't believe it, watch a program on a regular channel! Then, watch the same channel in HD. You will notice a biiiiiig difference. To see if this HDTV was good for gaming, I decided to test it with my PS3. Of course, tested it on Madden 2009. The players were not blurry in no other way ala Vizio. Then, I decided to buy a Monster HDMI cable and plugged it up to my PS3. Then, a message popped up, stating that it recognized the HDMI cable. Then, I was given a menu, which gave me a couple of options, which I said YES to. Then, the menu noted that the resolution would go to 1080p. I got excited. Then, I noticed that the letters on the menu went from big to small.I went on to re-play Madden and I noticed a biiiiig difference in the quality of the picture. After seeing the \"it's in the game\" screen, I saw that the following screen said EASports HD Gaming. Without the HDMI cable, it used to just say EASports. That was one indication that I was going to see some really enhanced HD graphics. Then, I played the game. All I could say was, wow! The graphics were more enhanced, detailed, colorful and crisp. Can you imagine anything better than PS3 graphics with 1080p resolution? You just cannot get any better than that. The only thing about the change in resolution is that the camera shows the players at a distance and does not zoom in on the players. This does not matter. The enhanced graphics will make you forget about that. If you are a gamer, I highly recommend that you get this TV, as well as the cable. Of course, other games show great, too. I played Killzone 2 and COD4, to name a few. Picture those games in 1080p!!! The DVDs or Blu-rays that you play will show great, as well. You WILL see a VERY noticable difference.The only things that I do not like on this TV is the sound system is not that great. The other issue is the stand is a little nerve racking to put on. Other than that, I am very satisfied with the product. Plus, I have comfort in knowing I have an HDTV with a good reputation. On the safe side, I still got a three year warranty because the regular warranty, which comes with the TV does not cover everything that the extended warranty covers. Additionally, before deciding to pay extra money on a 1080p HDTV, I would suggest saving your money and buying this HDTV, along with the cables.

Actually never looked at tvs in stores since its hard to get out, but the sales guy on phone at circuit city said this is rated 3rd by Consumer Reports. I needed this size to fit my ent.center so chose 720p based on other reports & its mostly fine. We use standard cable (not HD) yet and the regular channels are slightly fuzzy. We can live with it since we don't wish to invest more in our cable company. The tv automatically plays channels in the 100 range which are HD or maybe dig channels-I don't know, but they're VERY clear & enjoyable. Just like the nbc/cbs/abc channels after 5pm, they broadcast in hd and I guess the antenna picks it up. Wii looks great on this tv. Very easy to set up & lock out programs I don't want the kids to view. Also easy is switching the lock off for my husband to view. My living room is full-on daylight all day (cathedral ceiling, large trap windows) and this screen is amazing unlike our previous old tv. No longer is the screen hard to view because of direct sun. No more shutting blinds to see the screen. And forget the math formulas on getting a large screen if watching it from 12' away. We can easily watch & read what's onscreen from about 20' away. No problem with angles either. My complaint would be the time delay when changing channels. Instead of just popping up its got a couple secnds delay before the screen & sound come on.

My unit has audio sync problems that are most prominent if you are utilizing the component inputs or the coaxial cable.  The sound is ahead of the picture.  I attempted to call LG & waited on hold for as long as I could on a few separate occasions. Their automated service even offers to call you back rather than wait on hold but guess what?  You never get that call back.  I finally attempted to use their online chat help and that person told me that unless you were using the HDMI cables you couldn't expect the audio to sync correctly.  So  I can play my PS3 with good audio but not use my cable service, Wii, or dvd player.  She couldn't explain why they even put component inputs on the TV if it would not work.  If you google \"37lg30 a/v sync problems\" you will find that this is a common issue with LG.  I purchased the unit at Best Buy and they are stepping up to the plate and sending somebody out to look at it( they don't agree with the logic of the LG support person).
