Had been using a 13\" CRT but wanted a flat screen like the rest of the TVS in the house. Actually didn't buy this from Amazon. Bought it locally because the price was the same and I could have it NOW! Another plus was that if I decided that I really didn't like the TV or its sound I could easily and quickly return it. The only downside was state taxes. First off I should say I have no problem with the sound portion of this TV. A few other have commented on that but it plays and sounds just fine. I have a 7.1 surround sound hooked to my main television so I have a reference. No, I'm not even trying to compare the two but I am aware of sound quality. This is quite a bargain and the overall quality is more than satisfactory. I was a good choice for me and therefore I can recommend it.Update: after listening to the sound produced by this TV for maybe a month or so, I decided to add a set of small speakers to it which has improved the sound quality dramatically. Though it was possible to listen to it originally, adding the speakers completely removed any sound issue.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Flimsy Bezel", "Author": "jrvtecaccord", "ReviewID": "R1AM2WQ6JNGXDQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV to replace a Samsung T260HD that has been great as a \"hybrid\" monitor.  This TV was going to be used for 50/50 computer monitor & PS3 gaming for a child's room.  Unfortunately it's come time to replace the T260HD due to a loose rear HDMI connector and just looking outdated compared to new models.  There are not to many QUALITY choices on 1080P tv's 26\" or smaller so I gave this 22\" a shot.  First the TV aesthetics look great!  Connections are good with side facing HDMI, but didn't like the rear headphone jack since it's frequently used.  Another plus was NO \"power brick\", usually small TV's this thin have an external power converter.  PQ was good for a screen this size, and surprising sound was decent too.Unfortunately I had to return this tv because of the flimsy bezel that is around the screen.  I had the tv wall mounted using an articulating mount.  During gentle adjustments holding the top and bottom of the screen to adjust tilt, the top portion of the bezel would snap off.  Being in a child's room with daily adjustments, there is no way it would physically last.  Looking at the bezel, it looks like it just uses snaps on the top and screws on the bottom.So if you plan to use this tv on an articulating mount, I can't recommend, but if you don't it should make a great little tv.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lacks features and has other problems/defects", "Author": "Ash Bzak \"Ash\"", "ReviewID": "R3RVEHIGBZZSBH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was pretty pleased with this TV when I removed it from the box.  It was slim/light and had a slick look.  The picture was respectable for a 22\" and the sound was okay.  I was also happy that a model this size offered 2 HDMI ports.  Also, it looks great as a monitor for my computer.  But... then I noticed a few problems.Minor Problems:-No soft mute-Very hard to manually add/remove channels.  (Originally, after messing with my TV and its manual, I concluded that it wasn't possible... but it is if you hit the \"content\" button on the remote.)  This may not seem like a huge deal, but the TV ended up picking up 100+ channels.  Most of those are the HD versions of my channels.  I'd like to remove the repeats and just keep the HD versions, but the TV really hides this feature.  I found out where to do it, but I still can't get it right. It is a shame.Major Problems:-The A/V, component adapter that connects to the TV just doesn't work.  This is the second time I've had Amazon ship me this TV and the adapter still doesn't work.  I've tested it with three different devices and the TV doesn't recognize any of them.  A huge problem for me, considering not all of my devices can connect using HDMI (so I must use the component).  I'm sending this model back and trying a different one.  I want a TV with working ports.-Samsung's customer service is not so good.  They told me that I should buy a new adapter because the one they sent me could be defective.  What?  No thanks, Samsung.  Thank goodness for Amazon's fantastic return policy.In summary, check ALL the inputs before your 30-day grace period ends with Amazon.  The VGA, 2 HDMIs, component, headphone jack, USB, etc should all work out of the box.  If they don't, send it back!  Samsung isn't the best with customer service, so I suggest dealing with Amazon first and foremost.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointed with the sound", "Author": "Carmen J.

Once plugged in the TV speakers will be off and the sound will come through the external 2.1 speaker set.I would recommend that you purchase a powered set of speakers (they have an amplifier integrated with the speakers) and a set with a sub-woofer to improve the bass response. Of course the better the set of speakers, the better the sound will be.I am using an old set of PC speakers from one of my older computers -- this is much better than the speakers that come with the TVIn general I love the TV -- the picture is great.

We also have a blu-ray connected as well. So far, we're pleasantly surprised.We were worried after reading the negative reviews of this TV but there aren't a lot of options as Samsung and LG are the only \"big name\" brands that I've found to make a 22-inch LED TV. So we decided to take the plunge based on our past good experiences with Samsung products.We're using this as a second TV in a medium-sized bedroom, and mostly for regular/standard definition cable. The picture quality on standard def was a pleasant surprise. It's quite good. (We previously returned a 22-inch Vizio that was fine for high def but horrible on standard def). The sound? Well, it's not great. But there's plenty of volume and voices are legible. It's OK for most TV shows, news etc. I can't compare to other TVs this size but doubt any of them have truly good sound. High-def content is fine as you'd expect with a Samsung.The similar Samsung 5003-series 22-inch TV gets decent reviews but lacks any audio outputs. This TV has a mini jack and optical output so there are options for improving sound for those who'll be using it for more than everyday TV shows.

The UN22D5000 has excellent color range; decent speakers considering the footprint, weight, and cost; and looks stylish as well.After using this as a PC monitor for about a week, I have noticed some glaring faults.  First, picture sharpness struggles to hold up to other only slightly more expensive LED displays and cheaper PC monitors.  Some of this can be mitigated by spending some time with the excellent display tweaking control panel, but I generally have no problem with that kind of thing and was still unable to achieve the sharpness I wanted (after tweaking, small text remains somewhat distorted, but everything else displays well for the most part).  Second, the mini-stereo output suffers from noticeable background fuzz.  Finally, the base is flimsy.  While I'm experiencing a closing drawer, my Samsung is experiencing a 6.0 earthquake.So sit still, only use headphones to listen to loud things, and don't try to read too much, and you'll love it.  The colors/contrast on this display really are its saving grace.  The blacks--the weak point of most displays--are surprisingly rich, and a little play with the image settings will yield some fantastic colors across the range.

I can store 30 movies on a 32GB thumb drive making a DVD player unnecessary. But a 22\" in this price range should have ALL the high end features like wifi or ethernet. No built in Netflix or other net based apps like the other high-end Samsung models. Picture is clear and bright and the TV itself is very attractive. Great TV at $149 but for $269 it leaves something to be desired. I'm happy with my purchase because I really needed a 22\" with USB thumb drive streaming and it does this in spades.UPDATE: Just found out you can attach a card reader to the USB port and it will read your SDHC Cards. I have a bunch of 32GB SDHC cards laying around so now I'm filling those up with movies ;-)- It also has a very nice audio streaming app built in. The card reader compatibility just gave it another 1/2 star.

The Samsung UN22D5000N22D5000 LED 1080 P 60 is beautiful out of the box.  The stand attachment and cable search and identify went beautifully and fast.  I'm thinking, awesome.Then, surprise.  There's no adjustment on the stand, vertical or nothing.  My application is a bit above eye level in my office above phone and computer.  From that up 10* angle, the screen turns dark,  some features are black.  I tried propping it up in back with paperbacks, that helped viewing, but was unstable.  Further, the picture is fuzzy although it says it's HD.  Not as good as the old Gold Star!  Go figure.  Perhaps it's the refresh rate, 60 mhz.  Can't adjust that.  And finally sound.  Weak.  I read some reviews and decided to hook up some portable speakers I have --- and cranked all the way up, what would blow out the room with my computer music or videos, the TV is at a modest level.  It's okay for my 2' away application, but not good.SO, make sure you get the 120mhz refresher, be mindful of your viewing angle, and don't expect loud sound from this machine.  It's \"good enough\" but not great, not what I was expecting.  And now, a gift, stuck.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Audio Problem:???", "Author": "Jose A.

I had been using a Samsung T220HD monitor as my TV and it worked great with my xbox 360 since the 360 supported the monitors native resolution (1650x1080). However, the PS3 only supports standard TV definitions (480p, 720p, etc.) and I wanted to avoid playing on a non native resolution.  The TV works great on most games (Arkham City and Uncharted look great on my PS3), but I did notice that something didn't look 'right' on my 360.  The colors on the dash board seemed wrong when I got it and there were a lot of 'jaggies'.  I fixed the jaggies by turning the sharpness all the way down and after messing with the TV's setting it does look better, but the colors still don't seem right on the 360.  I would mess with the color setting, but the thing is the colors look really good when I am using my PS3 and I don't want to have two different configurations I have to keep switching between.  This issue is probably related to how the 360 outputs the signal, and doesn't seem to effect every game (Mass Effect looks great but the colors on Black Ops seem strange compared to my old TV).  The TV is good and has a lot of features (I haven't tried the media streaming off of USB yet), although the game mode is horrible and it has to be on standard display mode to have access to the advanced settings.  The color issue seems due to the 360 and not the TV, and it is something I will most likely just get used to.  There may be a way to change the setting so that both the PS3 and 360 look good, but since this is a fairly new product I haven't been able to find much online and I don't have much knowledge when it comes to TV settings.  I have watched Hulu Plus on it and as a TV the picture is great.  Despite what people have said, I think the sound is good (I am using it in my bedroom which isn't terribly large) and for the most part I use headphones for gaming (the jack is in the back which is a little annoying).  Over all it is a good TV with a lot of bang for your buck, I would recommend it.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible color.", "Author": "trader", "ReviewID": "R3JPL7C0TK3WEZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ugly color.

What is truly amazing about this TV (and i'm writing this as an update for November 2012) is that it actually worked most of the time during our 4 day blackout following Hurricane Sandy!!!  I don't know how, or why, but while our power was out, the only things that actually worked were some of our energy saving flourescent lights and this TV.  My guess is that current draw is so low on this TV, it will do this during some blackouts, where there still may be smaller amounts of energy available on the power grid.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "22\" Led", "Author": "jamo", "ReviewID": "R33VKWLMF02TT7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great TV Sound OK But for a 22\" Led TV I can live with itWatch were you buy this TV some of the TV don't have all the hookupthe one i got had only 2 HDMI & 1 USB & 1 Component videoI also herd on line that some other people had the same problemso watch the TV you buy Thar are 2 22\" being sold under thesame model number one must be a upgraded model .", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004N85TY2"}}
