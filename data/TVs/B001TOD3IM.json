{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture with a few drawbacks", "Author": "whickus", "ReviewID": "R2YSGIKPY6CY1J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had been looking at and researching HDTVs for a while and had pretty much decided on going with a plasma, due to the better viewing angle and deeper blacks. I was a bit hesitant, though, about picking up a plasma because of all the \"burn-in\" horror stories that have piled up over the years, so I was still hoping to find an LCD display that would blow me away while still being affordable. When I came across this Toshiba, it appeared that this would be that LCD. I made several trips to the big box whose logo looks like a big yellow tag and spent close to an hour each time comparing a few different models as best as one can in the controlled lighting of the retail environment. I was impressed with the black level, overall contrast, and picture quality of this tv. The image also appeared to be cleaner than others, with very few jaggies or digital artifacts.I ended up purchasing this tv (great deal with the free 19\") and taking it home. The screen size is plenty large enough to see clearly from 10 ft away, but not too bulky to carry inside, unpack and set up by myself . It looks great and feels sturdy. The light-up Toshiba logo is a pretty nice touch, but I set it to off since it's a little distracting. There are a TON of picture adjustments available through a few standard and advanced menu options. A lot of these options are probably only available on most other sets through service menus, which are meant to be navigated by professional calibrating services. I spent the first five hours of Saturday and a few more on Sunday tweaking the picture while watching blu-rays, with my main attention on getting a good, dark black level and accurate skin tones. I got the settings dialed in to what pleases my eye and thought it looked darn good (maybe not a professional calibration, but I was very pleased with it). The sound was not as bad as I've read in some reviews. I never experienced the crackling that others have, but I also never needed to turn the volume up past 30, even sitting 10 ft away. So far, everything was great but naturally, with the good, you get the bad.The drawbacks that I experienced were more personal annoyances, I suppose, but I've read that they are inherent to LCDs (to varying degrees), and I still could not ignore them after I discovered them. The first of which is the limited viewing angle. After the hours of tweaking, the set looks incredible when viewed head on. This changed, though, when I stood up or watched as I walked around the room. The black areas turn bluish and the overall picture loses its pop. This was the case if I viewed from any other angle than sitting on the couch directly in front of it. Granted, that's where I plan on watching tv from, but if I wanted to watch from the kitchen or have guests over, it wouldn't be as enjoyable. I was kinda disappointed because I had not experienced this in the store. It's not horrible, just something I didn't like. Also, it may have been exaggerated by how good the picture looks head on. The off angle picture may be as good as last year's model, but by improving the head on picture, it doesn't look as good from the sides. Who knows. I'm also coming from decades of watching CRTs where the viewing angle does not change. I knew to watch out for this with LCDs, but I guess you just can't get away from it unless you spend a few grand on one.My other gripe was with the uneven backlight, or cloudiness, in dark areas, especially along the top and coming from the top corners (\"flashlight\" effect). Before purchasing this tv, I had found only one account of this occurring with this Toshiba. I had actually forgotten about it and wasn't looking for it when I noticed it myself. I didn't notice it until nighttime when I had the lights dimmed and the screen was supposed to be black. It's more apparent while performing non-viewing actions, such as switching inputs, changing channels, etc., but it is noticeable at certain times while watching movies. I didn't notice this during the day but, again, just something I didn't like. It's also possible I received a faulty display.All in all, this is a great LCD for the price. I couldn't find one in-store in the same price point that came close. Great picture, super sharp, and lots and lots of picture tweaking options. I didn't have the chance to take home any other LCDs to see if they had the same low viewing angle properties or uneven backlight that mine did, so I don't know if this Toshiba is an exception or not. I did end up exchanging it for a plasma, though, because I felt they suit my tastes better (and it turns out that burn-in is not a huge issue anymore), but for those looking for an LCD and looking to spend $1200, I would highly suggest taking a look at this one.", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "picture great but sound issues", "Author": "J. mulvey \"vbdic\"", "ReviewID": "R2UHKA72ZXLHCO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Recieved TV and delivery was great, even carried downstairs and unboxed it, great service.

Initially very upset but only took a few minutes and two sheets of damper cut up and placed across the back of TV case to fix issue.  I contacted Toshiba service and they were accomodating and supplied me with local service provider information but I find it disturbing that these issues are present in a new TV from a major manufacturer.

I decided on the Regza, and was very please with the picture quality.  I haven't seen any other LCD that surpasses the picture quality, but MANY that fall far short of the quality of the Regza.  Given my level of satisfaction with my first Regza, I purchased another larger set for the new home.  Again, very satisfied with the picture quality.I only have one complaint.  The right speaker vibrates to certain tones.  Strangely, it seems to be tied to a certain level or quality of recording, because it's not always vibrating.  But, let's say I'm watching a program on the Discovery channel.  For the entire program, the speaker will frequently vibrate.  Then, I'll watch a baseball game on ESPN and will not hear a vibration through the entire game.  Anyway...I've got external audio system hooked up, so when I REALLY want the quality I can just mute the TV and turn on the receiver.This problem is probably a one-off, so I will not let it affect the overral rating here.  I just don't want to deal with the hassles of returning the darn thing and waiting for ages to get the new one.That said, I highly recommend the Toshiba Regza!Jonathan AlmquistMinneapolis, MN", "Date": "September 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "excellent tv for money", "Author": "freiwill01", "ReviewID": "R1X0Q0ODVM1KDM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "had this tv for about 2 weeks now. it replaces an existing tube tv (also toshiba).  got this from best buy when they had it on sale for 1099. delivery was straightforward with original packing.  tv came already assembled on the stand inside the box -- all you have to do is lift and set it on your tv stand.standard definition (SD) channels look ok -- imo, all TVs (lcds, plasmas) should be able to produce SD signals as good as tube TVs. it's like software being able to support earlier versions.HD channels look very good but I just don't think there're enough of them out there yet.initially i had a strange problem via the HDMI connection where it'll prevent the remote to control the cable box the first 10 min after turning on the tv and cable box. after 10 min, everything's resumes. scour the web for similar issues and found one post but no solution. my eventual fix is to connect both the coaxial and the hdmi cable and the problem went away.another surprise with hdmi connection is it does not carry closed caption info, so i can't turn this feature on and off with the TV remote.  This is not an issue with coaxial connection. googled it and the solution seems to be hidden inside the cable box settings: to get to it, you have to turn the cable box off leaving the tv on.  hit the menu button on the cable box remote to access the closed caption options.so far my transition to hdtv has not been as smooth as i had expected but in no part the tv's fault.other things i love about the tv is the base it sits on is very wide so it looks extremely stable. the matted screen is great -- no more unnecessary glare/reflections.

Truly one of the best bang-for-the-buck models out there. That said, there are two common problems that people have experienced with this set and others in the Toshiba Regza series. I had both, but have found solutions.1. CABLE REMOTE CONTROL INTERFERENCEWhen the TV is in \"auto-view\" mode (the default), it emits an IR signal to measure ambient light, and adjusts the TV's backlight brightness accordingly. This signal can cause remote controls for certain cable boxes (in my case, a Motorola DCH6416 from Suddenlink) to work intermittently or in some cases not at all. From what I've read, remote controls for some other devices (satellite boxes, audio systems, etc.) can also be affected. The solution is simply to switch the TV from \"auto-view\" to one of the fixed modes such as \"standard\". Granted, this is not a perfect fix as you are disabling an advertised feature of the TV that you've paid for. Some others have reported that separating the TV and the affected device by several feet will eliminate the issue as well, although this may not be practical depending on the physical setup of your system. For me, disabling AutoView solved the problem and I'm satisfied with that.2. AUDIO DISTORTION/ECHO USING HDMI INPUTSearch the web and you'll find this to be a common issue as well: after several hours of use, the sound can become distorted and tinny, with a buzzing sound and an odd \"echo\" effect. This affects the TV's own speakers as well as the signal coming from the set's audio output jacks. Toshiba has known about this problem for some time; from their web site (dated 3/26/10):\"To ensure the satisfaction of our customers and to maintain the integrity and quality of our products, Toshiba America Consumer Products, L.L.C. (\"TACP\") is posting this notice about the 40XV645U, 40XV648U, 46XV645U, 46XV648U, 52XV645U, 52XV648U, 42ZV650U, 47ZV650U, 55ZV650U, 46SV670U, 55SV670U TVs. This is not a safety issue.Recently, it has come to our attention that users of a small percentage of those model TVs that we have shipped and are used in connection with a set top box via HDMI may experience a random audio echo while watching programming.  If this were to occur, it would only be after many hours of continuous viewing and can be temporarily resolved by turning the TV off and on again.If this audio echo is interfering with your enjoyment of your TV, please contact TACP Customer Solutions at 1-800-631-3811.\"The permanent fix is to upgrade the firmware from ver 6.1.43 to 6.1.45 by downloading from Toshiba's support site at [...]. This admittedly is not for the technically challenged, as it requires downloading the firmware executable, extracting the contents to a USB flash drive, then finally applying the patch to the TV via a somewhat convoluted procedure. I initially had some problems, and it wasn't until I manually changed the directory structure of the flash drive to put the boot image file in the root (instead of a sub-folder as created by the upgrade installer) that I was able to get it to work. But then again, I'm a tinkerer with a fair amount of computer knowledge, and I was determined to figure it out by myself. Those not so inclined would probably find that Toshiba's tech support would walk them through the process, and I've even heard in some cases they will send you a flash drive with the patch pre-installed -- all you have to do is insert it into the TV's USB port and turn it on.These two issues aside, I'm very pleased with this set.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV for the money", "Author": "R.

Little did I know that comparing HDTV's is much like comparing the old apples and oranges.  Reviews are usually mixed, for even the highest priced models.  I needed a matte screen, as the TV sits next to a huge picture window (which meant a plasma wouldn't work)and I wanted a headphone jack for my wireless headphones (excellent sound and I can watch my action movies without bothering my wife).  I also wanted a brand that I had luck with in the past.  Well, I didn't make a decision in time to take advantage of either Thanksgiving or Christmas deals.  When I saw Amazon had the bundle deal that included the Blu-ray player for the Regza, which was on my short list, I pulled the trigger...finally!It arrived today.  Kind of an ordeal, as I attempted to schedule both the TV delivery and the cable people to switch me to DVR/HD box.  I wanted the TV here first so the cable guy could hook it up.  It took lots of phone calls but it worked out.  CEVA delivered...but almost didn't.  I was outside when he drove down my dead end road, backed into my driveway, then drove away as I ran after the truck yelling and waving my arms like an idiot.  Did I mention that I have a heart condition and really didn't need to run the 440 in 20 degree weather?  Anyway, caught the guy and still don't understand how he missed the house (he had GPS and I have huge address numbers on the house).  At the drivers recommendation, we did not turn on the TV to check it out because of the cold.  I let it sit a couple hours.  This was quite the gamble because the TV arrived with two big taped over holes toward the bottom of the box, almost as if a small fork lift  stabbed it.  All is well that ends well...no damage to TV.  The picture is amazing and I don't know what all the complaints were in the reviews...sound is fine, no buzzing, ghosting or any other issues that people mentioned.

I did some research on LG, Samsung, Sony, and Toshiba and weighed the cons of each television that suited my preferences. The LG televisions I was comparing to this Toshiba have been known to have lip synch issues, while this particular Toshiba line has audio distortion problems over hdmi. I chose the Toshiba over the LG because I felt the lip synch problems with the LG would be more of a nuisance for me.Sony and Samsung had good sets, but at a higher price, and they certainly didn't seem anymore immune to failure than Toshiba or LG. I'm sure some brands are more susceptible to breaking down, but just paying more for a television doesn't mean that it's going to last longer. I've owned my previous Toshiba for a little over 2 years without any major issues, so this of course had a big impact on my decision.I purchased my TV from a local BB on sale. I purchased the insurance and my total with taxes was just over 1K. Reading some peoples' experiences who paid up to $2000 on other televisions and then have them break down in 3-6 months was a scary thought, so I paid a bit more for peace of mind.On the 46xv645 itself:  The user interface is a mixed bag, very easy to change inputs, picture size, mostly due to the functionality of the remote. Digging through the menus is a different story, I have a lot patience with settings and will usually keep at it until I find what settings are useful to me. There is an abundance of color adjustments that I'd rather not deal with unless I have a proper calibration disc or other aid.  The picture quality after some rather basic adjustments is fantastic, at least compared to my previous Toshiba. Some settings such as noise reduction seem to work poorly with HD satellite channels, I turned both of the settings off. The Resolution+ setting also doesn't seem fit for HD channels, but I did use it at a low setting for gaming. At first it seemed that the extra 4 inches for this tv seemed like a bad thing for HD stations - I couldn't quite get as natural a picture as I was getting with my 42\". After some more adjustments, this TV really does look a lot better than my first lcd.  The second day of owning the TV we experienced the dreaded audio issue over hdmi. Since I was aware of the issue and I based my purchase on many combined factors, I was disappointed but willing to put up with it. I can just use my surround system if the speakers get intolerable.  Gaming is fantastic on this TV, this (and I'm sure blu-ray as well) is where the TV really shines. I never experienced delayed reaction with my other Toshiba, and this one is no different.Once this series (xv645) is unavailable, Toshiba will be stepping up to LED back-lit models. Many stores are already out of the 46xv645 and those that have them are probably low in stock.

I went to the Direct web site and found the code to program into my Direct remote for the TV. The only issue, as has been discussed on several of the reviews, was after a short time, the remote stopped working until the TV was turned off and back on, and then everything worked OK for another bit, and then it did the same thing. I couldn't get a lot of help from online sources but when reading the TV manual a little closer, found where it stated that some issues were possible with HDMI equipment connected to the TV. I began experimenting with the settings and finally found the one that solved the problem for me. It was the speed  setting for the on /off on the TV. I set mine to the fast setting and have had no problem since. I think the other setting was constantly emitting a signal that interfered with the Direct receiver.

Worse, the normal zoom function that can be used when watching TV or HDMI sources doesn't work as well with the VGA port.  It only lets you stretch the image horizontally instead of \"zooming\" in, so even if you change your computer to output a widescreen format, you can't get it to fill the screen.  A bargin basement Insigna I've used takes full 1080 inputs just fine.  If you plan on connecting a computer to a VGA port, look somewhere else or plan on upgrading your video card to output DVI andusing a DVI-HDMI cable (something I cannot do with my laptop).This is not related to the product, but I got my TV shipped by CEVA Logistics and it was the worst delivery experience I've had.  Delivery took more than a week longer than estimated and was not white glove.  Once I hooked everything up myself, I noticed that the box was taped together and the manual and remote were missing (thanks to Toshiba for providing free replacements), leading me to believe CEVA destroyed the packaging, lost the contents, and took a week covering up their mistake before getting it to me.  I would have rathered paid the sales tax and bought from a brick and mortar store instead of dealing with them.

My husband and I purchased this knowing that we'd have a surround sound system so I can't say I've heard the actual sound the TV gives in a long time. However, my in-laws have the same TV and until we recently got them the Philips HSB2313A Soundbar, [...], they were having regular issues with the TV's sound quality. After some time of watching TV, the sound would become distorted and the only way to alleviate the problem was to turn it off and back on. There was a time when that wouldn't work, so the TV was just left off. Having a sound system with HDMI hookups is probably the only solution. Having said all of that, the picture quality is amazing. Obviously the picture is only as good as what you're watching on it and since Time Warner isn't THAT great and does 1080i at best, it's somewhat decent. In comparison to watching well-transferred blu ray on our awesome PS3, the picture quality is nothing short of spectacular. I think Tron Legacy is my favorite thing to watch on it (though I'm probably biased by the amazing sound quality also). Basically if a blu ray disc has a good picture rating, it's going to look amazing on this TV. I think we have it on the sports setting so everything is as crisp and vibrant as it can be. I don't see a need for switching settings every time we're watching something different. TV shows and movies are filmed/processed the way they were meant to be seen (with or without graininess/noise) and all we can do is make sure our TV is set to present the clearest picture quality we can get, so the sports setting suits us just fine. The refresh rate is great and we don't like that camcorder type of look so we definitely do not have it set to the smoothest viewing. I haven't messed with the settings in a long time so I can't recall what the feature is named on the TV. I know there are newer options now but having done a search for smaller TVs recently, I couldn't find one that could match up to even this one so I still think it's completely wonderful and am 100% happy with it.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding TV", "Author": "Bill C.", "ReviewID": "R34P2RTHRQ9H23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had it almost a year and it is awesome.

I also have a Comcast HD package and the HDTV looks pretty nice, especially for sports, but not nearly as high quality as the Blu-Ray (Comcast is apparently 1080i whereas the PS3 is 1080p).  The sound is decent from the speakers on the TV, much better than most.  I listen to cable programming via the TV speakers and listen to the PS3/Blu-Ray through a surround sound system.  I mean, what can you really expect from TV speakers?  I remember when they used to be on the back of televisions!The TV is durable (I have moved once and it survived!).
