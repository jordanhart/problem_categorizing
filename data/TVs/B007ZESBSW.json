The picture quality is super. The sound is great also. I'm on a budget and after doing a month research on various televisions until I decided on this one,I'm well pleased. Now will it hold up? I hope to get many years of good service out of this television. The price is the best compared to other televisions of the same size. I would recommend this tv to anyone.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Majed M.

The price was almost the lowest when compared with other 40\" LCD tvs, but it had some features many others didn't.", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tv for the price", "Author": "sagespyder", "ReviewID": "R1HB2XBIC6YJPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My mom's old tv broke so I decided to buy her a new tv for X-mas. After doing many searches I came across this one. It is my mom's first flat screen and she loved it when it was delivered. I visited during X-mas and after buying her an HDMI cable you can really tell the difference and she was even happier. The only problem was the sound since the speakers are in the back but I intended on buying her a sound bar anyways. She loves her new tv and I believe that the tv fits anyone not too picky about name brands and needs to save some money.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hitachi 40\" Class LCD HDTV", "Author": "Emmalena M.
