{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Super cheap TV as a Raspberry Pi HDMI monitor; excellent video; poor speakers", "Author": "Kilgore Gagarin \"Those who believe in telekin...", "ReviewID": "RD47FC319GENR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I acquired this Seiki 22\" SE222FS TV primarily as a monitor for a Raspberry Pi running the open source XBMC media center software. For that purpose, I am very happy with my purchase. My only complaint is that the on-board speakers, which are mounted in the back, are VERY sub-standard which is probably the reason this set is so cheap. The SE222FS comes with a number of separate audio and video inputs which are very useful for using with other computers and equipment. I used the HDMI port and can verify that full HD and audio can stream from my Raspberry Pi to this piece of equipment. With the \"old school\" video composite connection, and the audio connections, I was able to use my Pi in these lower audio/video resolutions as well. With a VGA input I can also use this with some of my older laptops as an extra monitor as well.Set up consists of loading two (included) batteries in the remote control; the simple stand requires you screw in four (4) small screws. Plug in the included AC wall wart power supply and you're ready to go. This does not come with any other cables or hardware.Oh yeah. As a TV it's not bad either (save for the sound). The picture is LED vibrant and bright. I hooked up a pair of rabbit ears to the antenna input and was able to acquire 19 over the air channels, same as for my main set which uses a higher end antenna. The HD broadcast from my local PBS station was as good as any I've seen, even given the small screen size. This is a handy, general purpose monitor AND television for my personal needs.I have no illusions that I was purchasing a high-end piece of equipment. But, this gets an easy 4 out of 5 stars for being a surprisingly nice piece of equipment (1 star knocked off for truly horrible built in speakers).", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Picture - Bad Sound", "Author": "Craig Knowles", "ReviewID": "R12HFSHLNCQ6TG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I paid 99.99 for this guest bedroom TV and am pleased with the picture.  If I can add external speakers it's going to be a heck of a buy.  As the first reviewer noted, the sound is very poor, tinny.  But again, it was a hundred bucks!", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C0XJ0S8"}}
