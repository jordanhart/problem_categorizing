I was looking at 52 or 60inch model, but 40inch is best value right now, and works great, I bought 2 of these, use one as a PC Monitor, gaming is unreal with this TV.

Be sure to turn on Adv Contrasts and 240 aquamotion, makes a big difference in picture quality, especially when watching Blu Ray and 3D Movies.

I had to send back two faulty units (clouding, audio problems and banding) to get a decent one (still with some clouding). I didn't want to write about my experience, but I had no choice. After my encounter with the Sharp's useless and unprofessional customer service (they hung up on me) the saturation point was reached. In addition, today Sharp announced that the new firmware update is available, but I'm (not only me) UNABLE to download it. Without a new update I'm unable to watch any apps including Netflix. The previous update worked properly, but this does not work. This is really annoying.What I like about Sharp Aquos 3D LED TV:-Nice skinny look-Good HD picture quality (especially bright scenes)-Pretty accurate colorsWhat I don't like:-Clouding (Mura effect), especially visible when watching dark scenes-Banding (vertical darker bands), visible when watching lower contrast scenes with gray or white background. Especially visible when the camera is moving horizontally-Annoying firmware updates, full of bugs-Audio issues (buzzing bass sound)-Factory picture settings could be better-Apps incl. Aquos console-low tech, full of bugs-Customer serviceThis is my second Sharp model. I also own an older LCD Aquos, which is great.I was warned about new models, but I didn't listen. Now I'm paying for it.Sorry, but I can't recommend Sharp Aquos anymore.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Super TV", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R2JLM6JZODT6GL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is fantastic.I read some crummy reviews on it and was a little nervous before it arrived.

It came to replace a 46\" 830 series (basically the same as that one without 3d), and, unfortunately, all the quirks from the 830 series have been faithfully carried on by Sharp on that one. So the review will be very similar to the other review I made for the 830 series.*** *** *** *** ***EDIT: As of July 11, I'm dropping one star (down to three stars) due to the absolutely appaling bugs making most of the apps unusable. Read below.EDIT (Bis): read till the end of the review, I'm sharing my experience after 6 months of use.*** *** *** *** ***First, the good stuff:- Image quality is top notch. Nothing bad to say about it.- TV set just looks gorgeous. And it's soooo thin. It's amazing.- Features are ok. Netflix, web browser, Vudu and so on. Wireless and wired connections available. No complaints.- Comes with a sound limiter for those loud advertisements. Good stuff.Now, for all the stuff SHARP missed:- The sound quality with the original speakers is way beyond horrible. It borders the unusable more often than not. When the volume is cranked up, the sound manages to be both loud and still not understandable. A total joke. And a bad one.- The remote control. Well, where to start. It is the same as on the 830 series, but the \"Aquos\" button is now a \"3d\" button. And it comes with a few discreet touches of chrome.It's counter intuitive. The Volume and Ch buttons don't fall naturally under the thumb when the remote is held by the base (Which you would do, as the base is the thick part of the remote). You will have to hunt for there buttons every time.It is not lit. It accepts codes for other brands, if you need to control something else with it, but it won't pair with my Philips DVD player no matter what. Come on, it's a Philips, not a JaiWinGaiBun-ChataPang from the $0.99 store, is it ?!?- Even worse (remote control again) - this setup beats my personal record of the WEAKEST remote (receiver ?) EVER. You do have to POINT the remote to the exact, very EXACT spot where the IR receiver is, in order to control the TV. To be clear: That means that if you point your remote not at the base of the TV, but at one of the corners of the screen - it will not pick up the signal and you will not have any control over the tv. It's like trying to shoot a spot on the tv with a laser pen, without the laser dot.- TUNER: I don't know if it's tuner related, but switching between channels when using the Channel + / Channel - button takes several seconds. The TV will \"think\" for several seconds before displaying the channel. If you have 10 channels to sift through, you're looking at a good minute of your time.After a check - it takes exactly 3.5 seconds before displaying the channel. Even worse - it will remember your clicks, so when you press the channel up/down button let's say three times, it will go to the next channel, display it after 3.5 seconds, jump to the next channel after a fraction of a second, display it after 3.5 seconds, and so on. So once you started a \"Series\" of presses, you're out for 15-20 seconds before you can take control back.Called a Sharp tech, he said \"Oh, it's like that with ALL LCD tvs\". I asked why my cheap, old Zenith digital tuner (paid $35 for it) does channel swap instantaneously, I was answered \"Oh, sir, it's normal, it's a totally different technology\". Well, that was a totally not new way of trying to feed me BS. So here's the deal, Sharp: SHAME ON YOU for putting the CHEAPEST tuner you could get in that set !- BUGS: The TV went into power saving mode (TV on but no image) at least once in such a way that the only way to fix it was pulling the cord off the power outlet and plugging it back in. No turning on and off with the remote could fix it. Yes, it's copied from my 46\" review, but that set did it too !UPDATE: Three days after my first review - my apps are unusable. Netflix won't connect, vudu won't connect. I paired and re-paired the tv with my wireless router several times, and all my other Netflix enabled devices can connect. I guess a reset of the tv is in order.- Start Up time: Remember your old, old lamp TV from back in the 70's ? The one that took 15 seconds to turn on, as it needed to warm up ? You don't ? Turn on this TV. You will.******************************UPDATE: January 21, 2012:It's been now a good six months of heavy usage. Here are my thoughts:- All the cons cited above are valid. Awful sound, weird remote, slow tuner.- Netflix is still as erratic as on day one, but here's the fix:Your Sharp Netflix app hates being mistreated. It will punish you bitterly if you don't follow the proper procedure for quitting it. Which is the following: Stop the Netflix movie using the \"return\" button on your remote, then use the \"Exit\" button on the remote. Dare simply getting out of the app in any other way (turning off the tv, switching directly to a different input, switch to antenna), and the next time you get into Netflix you will be graced with a grey screen saying \"Could not connect, try again later\". It is still the same, after several firmware upgrades.Sharp's tech support (yes, they do exist) claims it's normal (why am I not surprised), and is clueless as to why any other Netflix app on any other device doesn't act this way.When this happens, your bet is to wait a random amount of time (anything between 3 minutes and 3 hours), or get to the apps menu, open any of the internet apps (aquos net for example), and wait for it to establish a connection to the internet (wait for the page to load basically). Once this is done, you can safely exit this app and go back to Netflix.- Image is as good as ever. No clouding, no problems.- The thing has managed to survive several organized attacks mounted by my 18 month old kid armed with an arsenal going from sharp pens through wooden toys to toy hammers. The screen is glass protected, so little fingers pressing it don't cause those funny puddles of color which kids love so much on those soft LCD screens they get used to. If only for that, this TV is worth every penny.- Even with the crappy sound, the sound limiter in the menu is a blessing when advertisement time comes. Suck on that, advertisements :)", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "colorful television", "Author": "teddy", "ReviewID": "R1Y8LOY7NU7TX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since color is my middle name, or at least I have been keenly interested in color since in the crib, I cannot say enough about the Aquos Quattron color capability.  I especially like watching wild life adventure and appreciate the marvelous quality of this television.  This is my secound Sharp HD TV and I would highly reccomend the brand.  It was not easy procuring a smaller model such as this 40 inch one.  It is the perfect size for the room it is in and I hope Sharp continues making models under 55 inches.  After scouting all local stores and having had a very bad experience trying to buy a 55 inch Quattron from a local electronics store( They threw out the stand,etc.) I resorted to online shopping.  I would do it again in a heart beat.  Amazon lived up to it's reputation again!  Who knew you could purchase an item like this, obtain extended warranties, and get it all set up with bells and whistles without entering a store?

First off i'd like to say that the Sharp LCD panels are among the best in the industry, well lit, and with the yellow colour filter added to the regular gamut, u get an unusually good picture in movie mode... Full HD picture, 3D that works well, although i haven't quite been able to get the 2D to 3D conversion to work that great yet... I think i just need to get the software and play the media through my gaming PC, onto this glorious Sharp LCD display... If ur buying this model in the store, make sure u have the service rep test the tv to make sure it works and no problems with the picture. Have the package shipped to u at ur own peril! I had to go through 3 tvs before i got one that worked 100%, the 3rd one worked 100% and that one was sent to me by Sharp directly. Their customer service is great as long as u follow their return instructions.The TV has 4 HDMI ports, one of which u can input a DVI-D link to HDMI conversion cable for a great PC display, and install a 3.5 audio minijack for sound, or just use a mini-HDMI to reg HDMI cable if ur PC has an HDMI output... Blu ray players can be auto activated and controlled automatically via the Sharp HDMI universal remote control. The TV unit itself has semi decent sound with a so called sub-woofer, although I had another older Sharp HDTV before this one (with no subwoofer) and that LC-40LE810U sounded better than this current TV! go Figure. The unit has a built-in WI-FI that works great, 6 viewing modes, plus 240 hz ultra smooth motion enhancement that almost rivals a Plasma! 40 inches is more than enough if u wanna hook up a high end graphics PC, gaming system, VCR, cable, and 3D Blu-ray surround system or player. The unit has analog audio output via a 3.5 jack out (as well as a 3.5 minijack in), and thankfully a full optical audio digital output for up to 7.1 channels of surround sound. (:D)Other inputs include 1 set of component ports, 1 analog coaxial input, 2 sets of old school audio/video input ports, 2 or 3 USBs, and 1 Ethernet input (if u don't wanna use WI-FI).3D auto detect works great with my Sony 3D Blu-ray player, but the tv will probably work with any high end 3D Blu-ray system. I recommend getting a 3D Blu-ray surround sound system to kill 2 media tasks with one button... :pAnyway, great TV if u buy brand new, note - take ur chances like me if u buy this as anything but brand new... Less than $900 and it may not be new...Last note: U have to buy the Sharp 3D glasses separate, I recommend the 3rd party \"Tru-Depth\" 3D active shutter glasses for Sharp 3DTVs.-ENJOY-UPDATE: 3/2013This TV works 75% well as a gaming monitor! In my opinion because it has an Aqua-motion 240 htz feature one can use \"Movie mode\" while in Full 1920x1080p for movies, but can also be used in 3D to game with! I mean, u can use the game mode (which matches the console or PC response time in 720p 3D, but for 1080p 3D gaming at 24-hz u really need the Aqua Motion Movie mode to smooth out the frame rate, and provide the best control available, at least until manufacturers start making 3D HDTVs with Dual Link DVI-D ports or Display Ports \"STANDARD\" on the back panels...Buy this TV (and 2 more if u can afford it to run in SLI with 3 nVidia GTX 590s (or above) on a Nvidia \"3DTV Play\" equipped Extreme Gaming desktop PC, and use the Xpadder program to map the PC controls onto a white Xbox 360 controller for Windows and I GUARANTEE you will have the coolest gaming experience of your life!

Do not purchase this TV or any Sharp LC series TV for that matter.  I purchased this TV for the bedroom, the LC-40LE385U, and the 60 inch version LC-60LE385U for the living room.  Out of the box both TV's appeared to work as normal, but thats about the only good thing I can say about this TV.  I have had them both for about 3 months now.  On both of them, they will randomly turn off and turn back on usually it happens quite a bit, about once every 2-3 mins.  Either way, not what I would expect from a TV manufacturer that claims to be in the top tier.  The TV also does not play well with my Sony home theater system.  One final thing that sucks really bad is that Sharp customer support is virtually nonexistent, if you want help with your product you better look elsewhere.  Another thing that sucks really bad is that they release software updates about every month, which you HAVE to download to use any of your apps.  That's right, Netflix will not load until you wait about 30-45 mins for the new software update to download.  If you try to update via the network, the updater will chug for about 10 mins and say that the update failed, \"Please try again\".  Thanks! No Netflix now until the update gets completed.  They are also really slow to update their website with the new software downloads, so no chance of updating via USB in a timely manner.  Unless you only watch TV once a week you can bet on your apps not working for a few days each month randomly whenever a software update comes out.  The moral of the story is that there are a lot of glitches and quirks that should be fixed but dont ever seem to be.  What kind of good are these software updates doing?
