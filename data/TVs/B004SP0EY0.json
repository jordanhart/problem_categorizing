The picture is very good and it has 3 HDMI inputs.

I wanted a tv that looked good with xbox and with functionality. This Tv has 3 HDMI ports where most high end Tvs have 2, and it doenst have that side view issue where the screen blurs and fades, color stays CRISP. The picture is amazing, i looked at all the Tvs i could and this was a close second compared to the equal specifications from Samsung which was almost $100 more. Im glad i bough this, the extra HDMI port was totally what sold me on this Tv.

The menu and remote control is what makes the TV easy to use and hassle free.  In this regard it is only mediocre. It seems little thought was paid to a fully functional menu system and ease of use features.  This is the skimpiest and worst menu system I have seen on a TV lately.  To give you an idea on how little thought was put into it it actually has an unused button on the remote.  I could go on but to give you an idea, the subtitles are keyed to the audio so if you hit sound mute the subtitles also go away?  Now you get programming listings not just for the current show, this one doesn't.  When the show description comes up it disappears quickly, you need to be a speed reader.  It has no time or clock feature.  It seems no thought was paid to the menu system which is an annoyance more than anything else.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "S.

They are nice and easy to learn, which is important when random people are using them every couple of days. I also really like the sound, which is better than my two Sony Bravias. The TV also looks nicer than the Sonys as it is full black, without any silver portions on the front of it (I don't know why, but the mixed silver frame just doesn't look as \"sleek\" to me as the total black face plate does). I liked the flat back on the TV which made it a LOT easier to mount than some of my other TVs (some, admittedly, have built in DVD players. Just a warning, when the back of the TV is anything but flat you need to use lots of plastic \"shim\" devices to get an adjustable wall mount to fit).I really wish they would stop including the pedestal stands with these big LCD TVs. I'd rather get $30 off and not have to add to my local landfill. Isn't the whole idea behind flats creens the fact that you can wall mount them?

I have it hooked up to my att uverse cable with HDMI and the picture on the HD channels is great! even on non HD channels the picture is much better than any of the older tube tv's in my house.

I have a 50\" Panasonic Viera in the playroom, which is awesome, and the 32\" Phillips doesn't have quite the same quality as the Panny, but for it's price, it has very respectable image....especially in HD. Set up was a breeze, and to be honest, idiot proof.I'm a little disappointed about the standard definition on this TV, but I'm not crazy about the standard definition on the HDTV that is hooked up to Bell satellite...so all is fair in that regards. The internal speakers of the Philips sound is quite impressive for this Phillips model, compared to my sisters Sony Bravia internal speakers, which sound like a cheap transistor radio. The Phillips can be heard clearly and easily, without having to adjust the volume between commercials or channel flipping from on channel to another. So all in all, I'm quite happy with this hdtv for the price, however time will tell how long it'll keep on running great. For now, my hat goes off to Phillips, for making a decent quality TV for a reasonable price. Just don't compare this tv to a Panasonic or Samsung, then again, you'll pay much more for the latter brands of same size. For a bedroom tv, the Phillips is the wise choice to buy. We simply watch the late night news with it, and then maybe a late night talk show or movie, then it's lights out. Should last a long time, or at least, that's my expectation....lets hope I'm right.

As far as the sound, it's nothing to rant and rave about. I have a set of bose companion 2's that I plug in there and the sound just fills up my little room. It's actually quite impressive.

Even though it's supposed to max. out at 720p, I'm getting many 1080p channels.  In the store I got it from, they had the TV on display alongside an LED Samsung and the picture on this TV was even better than the LED Samsung of the same size.* The tuner is excellent, too!  Picked up 120+ channels in 5 minutes.* All the settings are easy to get to even without the use of a manual.  All settings are FULLY customizable to create a \"home\" profile plus there are several presets that are very good for both picture quality and sound.* Very light weight with very stable base (screws provided to secure base to surface TV sits on, but it's not really necessary to use them in my opinion unless you have kids or worry about the TV being tipped for some other similar reason).* Simple remote!* Quick access buttons on remote to change between picture and sound profiles without having to go into the full menu for those options.* Great sound for a small sized TV!  Fully accessible/customizable EQ controls plus 4-5 presets.  I hooked mine into an Aiwa home theater system to get fuller/richer sound for movies & such, but for basic viewing the built in sound is excellent.  I did watch a movie with just the built in sound and it was very good -- I just have a personal preference for full rich sound.My Cons:* I really wish the remote had LED lights....  The based color of the remote is black, the buttons are grey, the text/writing on the remote is white/light grey.  Very difficult to work with in a dark room without turning on lights.* Slow to switch channels.  There's a 1-3 second delay between the channel switch and the channel actually coming in.  This doesn't bother me, frankly, but I can see where some would be annoyed by it.  From what I've seen with other sets this size, it's about the same across the board.IMO & IME, the pros far outweigh the minor cons & don't effect the functionality of the TV.  I saw the set alongside 10 or so others in the same size category and it really stood out for picture quality -- even trumped LED sets.  My parents have a Panasonic Viera (purchased in 2012) in the same size and the picture quality on that is inferior to this Phillips (quite the price difference too!).  One of my clients has a Sony Bravia (purchased in 2012) in the same size as this Phillips and the picture is FAR inferior on that compared to this Phillips.  Would not hesitate to recommend this TV to anyone.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesomely Average", "Author": "Hermin Hollerith, Maker of Tacky Wreaths in t...", "ReviewID": "R2ROWHU7670THI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary for those who don't like to read:  4 stars based on price and performance; doesn't knock your socks off but does a great job for the price.  Pretty close in performance to similarly sized 720p Samsung TVs costing $100 more.This is an exceptional TV in terms of price and features.  It is far from perfect and it comes out of the box configured to perform as nothing but mediocre.  But if you're willing to take the time to set it up to your personal tastes, you'll have a great TV for the price.This TV has great viewing angles that rival much more expensive models from competitors like Samsung, with solid performance below the center of the set (in case you like to watch TV from the floor) as well as to the sides.  The only color shifting and picture distortion happens when viewing off the corners above and below (a very odd place to be watching TV).Out of the box, the audio on this set stinks.  This is due in part to cheap speakers, but it is also due to the configuration that sets the default audio profile to something resembling a 1980's RCA portable color TV.  I'm not making this up, it sounds just like that.  While I'm a fan of retro electronics, I didn't expect my LCD TV to sound this way.  Fortunately, you can fix that with some tweaks in the audio section of the configuration that permits you to equalize the audio to your tastes.  While that doesn't make the cheap tiny speakers suddenly something by Bose, it does make the sound coming out of this TV waaaaaay better.  More than just tolerable, in my opinion.Similarly, the brightness and contrast on the set are have a default configuration that is, well, awful.  My first impressions after taking it out of the box and getting the channels scanned was \"wow, that's not what I saw in the store\".  The contrast setting makes any scene on TV with a high luminance background and say, a weather forecaster wearing a dark suit while on the chroma key, just painful.  Again, the menu has a configuration with some presets that make the video much better, or you can delve into your own contrast, brightness, color temp settings and season the look to your own tastes.  No, it won't look like that $2200 70\u0010\" LED Sony no matter what you do to it (aside from taking it back to the store and exchanging it for the $2200 Sony), but it does look pretty good.There's three HDMI inputs, component inputs (YPBPR, analog NTS), and the tuner does a nice fast job of scanning for clear QAM and analog channels.  There's also coaxial digital and analog audio outputs, something the Samsung used as a comparison surprisingly lacked.Four stars for being a solid yet inexpensive TV.  Take the time to set it up to your tastes and I don't think you'll be disappointed.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "You will go INSANE with the SLOW channel changing...", "Author": "SoCalGal", "ReviewID": "R1UA2315UYNP9B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I could mention more annoyances with this TV, but I just can't get over the horribly slow channel changing.Really, imagine clicking channel up, then waiting...first, you'll see a black screen , then this text 'Channel Search'...wait, now back to black (if the channel is not viewable) or you might finally see your show.

Erb", "ReviewID": "R1T229O0O0X4M3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My requirements for an HDTV were modest. I did not want to spend more than $300, I would be happy with 720p and I wanted to make sure the TV had at least 2 HDMI ports and audio out for external speakers.As I began researching I found this Philips 32\" HDTV as a refurb. I'd had good experiences in the past purchasing refurbished electronics so I decided to take a chance on the Philips HDTV refurb.As soon as I opened the box I was beginning to have second thoughts. The paper manual was in rough shape as if it had been handled previously (perhaps by a previous owner which is why the unit was refurbished???)The remote control felt very light and flimsy in the hand. No batteries were included which is not a big deal but I'm just relaying my experience. The TV Stand was already attached to the TV but it did not swivel or tilt at all.The bezel had a protective plastic film over it but when I removed the film the plastic was marked up pretty badly and was very noticeable... it detracted from the appearance of the TV.Most disturbing was the stuck pixel just about smack dab in the middle of the screen. It was such a bright and pointed light when viewing a dark background that I found it extremely obnoxious and that alone was reason enough to return the TV.Before returning the set I did go through the entire setup process. It was easy to select the language, choose antenna or cable then choose auto to discover analog and digital channels. Once it was ready to go I observed the quality of picture on both Analog, Digital and from DVD and was not overly impressed. There was a lot of blooming with some colors. I realize this is 720p but I did notice pixelation and an overall lack of sharpness in the image.Audio was not great either. Sufficient but not great. The speakers are not forward positioned so the sound is not directional towards you but sort of bounces out from underneath and behind the TV.I was expecting better in light of the mostly positive reviews of the TV from other users. Even if the LCD screen had not had the defective pixel, I still would not rate this TV very well as the screen sharpness was not great, although the viewing angle was quite good compared to other low-end HDTV's I'd seen. And screen brightness was pretty good. But my overall sense was not overly positive and the sound was not very good, certainly not nearly as good as the HDTV I ultimately bought, the Vizio E321VL 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV - Black. The Vizio is superior in every way compared to the Philips. Of course, it does cost a bit more, but in my opinion the quality far surpasses that of the Philips. Build quality, sound quality, speed of switching channels and even the remote is more substantial feeling.The Philips refurb was very disappointing.

It's useless.Piece of junk, avoid.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Price came down. Have bought it. Awesome TV!", "Author": "S. Adams \"S.

I would buy it at the pre-Christmas price of $250.00, but at this price I think I will consider a TCL with more feedback and a two year warranty. Pity. I would have preferred the lower price and then I could have gotten a 3 year Square Trade warranty to buffer my purchase. I will keep an eye on this for the next few days before I make my final decision. I am giving it 3 stars for the massive, sudden hike in price.Update: Thanks to David Miller for the reminder, this review was due for an update. The price did come down, as it tends to when one makes an issue of it on Amazon - especially when there is an intention to purchase stated in the complaint. I have used this tactic several times now and it has paid off every time so far (3 times now, I think). And I am very glad I complained and then followed through on my intention to purchase this item. I bought it on Jan. 17th, 12 days after posting my initial complaint about the huge price hike.This is a wonderful TV with great, easy to use features. The most important to me were that it has a truly great picture that is easily tweaked to my preferred specs. Also, it boasts 3 HDMI ports, one of which is conveniently located on the side, along with a USB port. It also has RCA inputs and component inputs, as well as an S-video input. All in all, I can hook just about anything up to this little gem of a TV! Overall, I am not as enamored of the sound quality from the unit as some of the other reviewers seem to be, but it really is better than what most other TVs give off, so that's just fine too.The controls and functions are very user-friendly and it takes no time at all to be cruising along smoothly, switching from one input to another.I have been shopping for a second TV for the upstairs bedroom and I have yet to find one that compares to this one for price, quality and features. I may very well be buying a second one very soon... as soon as the price comes down some more... ;)", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "High speed cable not included.

So I bought this one on Amazon as the reviews were good. This remote is much different from the remote I received with my last identical Phillips TV. The remote that came with this order hardly has anything on it and it seems to be made more cheaply. TV works as well as the last Phillips.So, it didn't come with the high speed cable. Someone said the cable costs $29.00 but that would be really expensive and this price is  no correct. I did not pay that much at all for a high speed cable, not more than $7.00.
