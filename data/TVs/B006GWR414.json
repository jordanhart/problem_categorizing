{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I expected something better", "Author": "NautiBuoy", "ReviewID": "R2VOBV19MLIH97", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I didn't buy my Samsung UN60D6450 through Amazon but I usually check for reviews here before making major purchases and want to return the favor.  I bought my TV through the leading auction website from a mega-seller who processes store returns and overstocks.  The seller claims the TVs are verified to perform according to manufacturer's specifications before sale, so while my Samsung was \"used\" it was supposedly \"good as new\".  After 29 days of trying to adjust to this TV--because I SOooo wanted to love it--I ended up returning it.  For reference, from where I sit to the TV screen is ~13', so 60\" is about the optimum size for an LED picture.The good: The TV itself looks beautiful, refined, and is ultra slim.  The stand swivels.  The remote is backlit.  Even though the screen is glossy I didn't have much problem with reflection from lights and windows in my great room.  There are a lot of controls to dial in the picture and sound for your environment.  The sound is quite good for something so thin, but I usually had my surround sound system on anyway.  It displays true HD and BluRay signals fairly well, although the image is a bit soft for my taste even with Sharpness almost maxed out.  Picture quality tends to be highly channel dependent even on HD channels.  Samsung customer service over the phone was excellent, but I'll come back to that later.The bad: SD channels were mostly unwatchable.  I found myself frequently rubbing my eyes trying to improve my focus and got a headache if I watched for longer than about an hour.  That's if I could watch at all; some SD channels were just too blurry to even deal with.  I was disappointed I'd have to give up watching most of the Encore movie channels, several secondary Premium channels, the Military channel, etc., which don't have HD counterparts via Comcast cable.  Even on HD channels I'd get judder, pixelation and ghosting sometimes no matter how I tweaked the settings.  The best picture I could muster wasn't as crisp as I've come to expect from the clarity of my LG 47LW5300.  And yes, I'm using good quality v1.4 HDMI cables and had Comcast verify their signal was coming through strongly.Continuing on with the bad: Once I purchased the Samsung wifi dongle, the TV had difficulty maintaining its link with my router.  My PS-3, which is right beside the TV, and my computer in the same room have no problem staying connected and show good signal strength.  I ultimately had to use the usb extension wire to drape the dongle over the top of the TV in order for it to stay connected--an unsightly solution.  I have a new, dual-band router and dedicated one of the 300 Mbps bands to the TV, yet the Samsung would have to stop and buffer every 40-50 seconds before it would continue playing anything.  Pausing the video for a while to let the buffer build made no difference so I'm guessing there's low internal memory... I don't know.  Needless to say, I didn't mess around with the apps much due to that frustration.  I also didn't spend much time watching 3-D.  The little that I did showed occasional cross-talk or ghosting of the image, but at that point in time I was still working with Samsung service and hopeful that something was wrong with my settings or the TV that could be fixed.Service: By the second day of playing around with all the available settings and not getting nearly the clarity I was expecting, I called Samsung customer support.  The call was answered quickly and the technician spoke perfect, unaccented English, so kudos to Samsung for that.  The tech walked me through a number of setting changes, which didn't help, and finally decided I should do a firmware update, for which he sent an email with the necessary links and instructions.  He also mentioned that if I had had my wifi connectivity established at that time (I hadn't bought the dongle yet) that he could have tried some things remotely--a nice plus.  He coded my case for level 2 support if the firmware update didn't improve matters.A few days later, I had both wifi connected and the firmware updated so I called back for Level 2 support.  The tech told me to go to the Picture Test screen and tell her whether it was OK, since that bypasses any signal input issues.  When I told her it was OK, but not as crisp as I'd expect compared to my LG, she set me up for in-home service.  Within an hour or two of hanging up, the local service tech gave me a call to set up an appointment for 2 days later.  I was both pleased and impressed with Samsung's responsiveness and desire to make things right.The tech arrived and was basically worthless.  He toggled the motion setting to dynamic, flipped to an HD golf channel, and decreed that the picture was perfect.  I flipped to some of the SD channels to show him the picture and his response was basically \"it's SD, what'd ya expect?\".  (FWIW, my LG makes SD channels look almost as good as the HD channels do on this Samsung.)  I flipped to an HD channel where we both saw judder and blurring multiple times and his response was \"some channels are better than others\".  I flipped to another HD movie channel that was OK, but not crisp, and he said it was because the movie was old (from the '90's).  I found another HD movie, this one from 2009, and his excuse was that scaling the signal up to 60\" loses definition.  He grabbed the remote and flipped back to the golf channel where I pointed out the 1/2\" halo around the entire body of the golfer on the putting green--which he called ghosting, but was different than the double image I consider to be ghosting--and all he said was \"I can't do anything to fix that\".  He didn't bother going into any of the picture settings to try something different, so the unspoken message he gave me (intended or not) was that this TV's signal processor is substandard and that's the best image you're going to get.  He was out the door within 10 minutes of showing up.  My hopes were crushed.So, I spent another two weeks trying to learn to live with the picture quality.  I finally decided that for this kind of money (even though I got a GREAT deal) I expect a good, clear picture and don't want to be limited by the TV as to which channels I can watch since I'm paying for them all!  So, back it went.  My advice is to *see* the TV perform on the channels you frequently watch--not just the store's demo channel or a BluRay disc--before you plunk your money down.  Otherwise, you might end up with a very beautiful girl that has a terrible personality.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "TV, Stand, Remote, Cables, Manual, 3D Glasses (qty. 1), HDMI Cable (qty. 1)", "Name": "Samsung UN60D6450", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xon-r%2Bm4L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006GWR414"}}
