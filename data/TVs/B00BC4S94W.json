We are very happy with the crisp clear picture. We tried Samsung and thought their picture was way too bright. This one it is really nice and you get so much detail. We tried the 3D and it worked fine, but most 3D tends to make me somewhat dizzy, so we do not use it. It is unbelievably clear and now that football season is here, we were able to really see if there was any motion blur and we have not seen any! Just a really nice picture. We were very pleased with the Amazon white glove treatment where the delivery person brought it in, set it up and made sure it was working before he left. Very professional and he knew exactly what he was doing. He was willing to take away the box and shipping materials, but we wanted to keep just in case we wanted to return....which we did not. The apps work very well and we were surprised how fast they loaded. We use Netflix a lot and used to use a ROKU box, but this TV is much much faster in downloads, so we do not use the ROKU any more. We tried a Samsung Smart TV and were not happy at all with the app performance. I couldn't even get Netflix to download a movie on the Samsung, so I connected it directly to my router via an Ethernet cable and it still wouldn't download. We returned the Samsung and tried another Samsung model and it didn't work out of the box. We gave up on Samsung. We saw the Panasonic at a local store, but they were sold out of 2012 models and were not carrying the higher end 2013 models, so we decided to buy from Amazon. We are very happy we did. I am only giving it 4 stars because the sound could be better than it is. We have it on a wall and adjusted the settings for wall mount and we still are not that happy with the sound. We will probably buy a sound bar in the future. Overall it is a great TV and you cannot beat the picture quality. It is more expensive than comparable 55\" TV's, but the picture really is that much better in our opinion. The colors \"pop\" and a Blu-ray movie is just awesome. I never thought I would buy a TV from Amazon, but it turned out very well.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good, almost excellent after calibration!", "Author": "Amerizoi \"Amerizoi\"", "ReviewID": "R3ROOZMWNIWSBC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me begin with saying I have an older Panasonic plasma which this will replace as my main TV. The build quality is good all metal with the exception of the clear strip at the bottom and the chrome finish V base which are plastic. Assembly was very easy but be sure to attach the black base cover before inserting the screws. Two of the 4 screws attach the cover to the TV base...easiest if you put in the top two screws then attach black cover with the other two scews.Attaching the power cord is very easy but because it attaches half way up the back seems very short, may be an issue if you place the unit on a taller stand. The metal trip was distracting at first but after a while disappeared. If you may notice the TV sits slightly crooked on the stand actually dips 1/4\" from right to left if viewed from the front. Interestingly I didn't notice fir a few hours due to setting up the calibration. The screen is semi gloss just like a plasma but doesn't have the double reflections of my plasma.Touch pad and voice remote, is rather a gimmick so much easier to use the tradional remote. I did find the viera remote 2 download ap for your tablet or phone interesting. You can send images etc from the tablet to the screen. Also the ability to fine tune the settings via your tablet a great time saver because navigating all the menus can take up time.As for the aps for the TV there are very few but the usual suspects are included. I find all the banner ads disturbing and hope I can find a way to turn them off. The main reason of cutting cable was to avoid the ads and now my TV has them.On to the image, it is extremely clear and crisp.  If you are looking straight on you see no color shifting at all, just one step in either side and the black bars on the top and bottom give off a blue shading, same result either up or down. During the set up I decided to use a custom mode so I could use some of the advanced image features and dial in a picture to look as much like my plasma as possible. The dark areas lose some of the shadow details but the light areas are well defined. Colors pop really well but don't look cartoonish and overblown like many other led sets I have been looking at. Several of the presets looked very good, cinema in my estimation is the best, just turn off all the smoothing options. Sound quality is good for such a thin set but if you want that booming sound get a sound bar or surround sound system, but for day to day it will be fine.3D was very surprising, very deep and the colors were fantastic. One of the best 3D images I have seen, avoid sitting too close the seems to cause a little cross talk. The image is a bit darker in 3D but you can adjust the out in the settings. The 2D to 3D feature is great, it will bring new life to your non-3D movies. Frankly I was astonished that it works so well.Finally, I would recommend the set for anyone who has never owned a plasma, while it is a good image it cannot measure up to my 4 year old plasma.I completed a calibration and the image is stunning in 2D and even better in 3D. I would highly recommend this for anyone grab one before they are all gone.I have tried several setting and the best in my estimation for blurays is cinema with the following settings:Backlight 47Contrast 95Brightness -1Color 43Tint 0Sharpness 59Color Temp warm 1Vivid Color onA.I. maxCats onVidei nr autoMpeg autoResultion weakCaption smoother offBrilliane enhancer offMotion picture setting weakStill love this tv and don't feel guilty leaving running while at work to keep the dogs company.

The picture quality is superb and motion smooth at 120Hz when source is configured correctly. Turning the ifsccc on allowed me to calibrate the picture to near professional quality by myself using Cnet's calibration setting found on their website. I mostly either use it for watching TV or using my HTPC (Home Theater Personal Computer). Using the HTPC negates most of the applications provided by the smart TV, but exploring the apps I found them to be adequate for what a smart TV can do. It does not have the best black quality but color and picture are very good. The sound quality is very good for a TV, but I would suggest getting a separate sound system such as an AVR (Audio Video Receiver) because it will give better sound and negate the other reviewer complaint that there is not enough AV inputs for his outdated or legacy sources such as VCR, game system, or any other device using yellow, red, and white inputs. Also my TV didn't have the clear plastic piece on the bottom of the TV which in my opinion is a bonus as it looked cheap. Wall mounting was easy and using a low profile mount the TV is all but flush with the wall.Here are the calibrated settings for the TC-L55DT60 which I used on the L60 with great success:In order to make these changes you must enable ifsccc by clicking menu and going to setup and scrolling to the bottom.-Picture mode Professional1 or 2Backlight 94Contrast 100Brightness 0Color 44Tinit 0Sharpness 50Color temp Warm2Vivid color OffAI picture MinCATS offVideo NR OffMPEG remaster OffResolution remaster OffCaption smoother OffBrilliance enhancer OffMotion Picture setting Off-Pro settingsPanel brightness LowAGC 0Black extension 0Cool white effect 0--W/B detail adjustmentHigh R -1High G -2High B 0Low R 0Low G 3Low B 0--More detail adjustment submenuInput signal level10 0, 0, -1420 0, 0, 030 0, 0, 040 0, 0, 050 0, 0, 060 0, 0, 070 0, 0, 080 0, 0, 090 -9,4, 0100 -7, 0, 0--Advanced picture menuGame mode off3:2 pulldown uto1080p pure direct Off [greyed out]HDMI content type no changeHDMI/DVI RGB changeBlack level LightI tweaked these settings a bit to my preferences as I like a brighter display and a less warm color.

I had a 55\" Samsung and someone broke into my apartment and stole it from me. They did me a huge favor! This Panasonic has way more smart features and choices than any Samsung. Samsung is garbage. Trust me. First off the Samsung has a plastic border around it that is really cheesy. This  Panasonic has a nice strong silver metal beveled edge around it. This T.V. also has voice to text over the internet. You can speak into the microphone on the touchpad remote and the T.V. types the text of what you speak. This Panasonic is Awesome! This T.V. has a sleep timer, as well as a alarm timer so you can set it to turn on and off specific times. The Samsung I had would only turn off my Bluray player. This Panasonic turns my Blu ray player on and off. It doesn't matter what the brand is either of the Bluray. This T.V. is so smart it automatically learned the code from my Sony Bluray remote without me programming it. Normally you have to put in a code so you can control other devices from a different brand. Not with this Panasonic. I can control my Sony Bluray player with my Panasonic T.V. remote and did not have to put the code in. This T.V. is the best T.V. I have ever purchased. You must buy it. Don't waste your time on Samsung. The picture quality is amazing as well when you play Bluray movies. Colors are good as well. Thanks alot Amazon for making my T.V. purchase a great experience! Your the best! From now on I'm buying my T.V.'s from Amazon.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "H.

Unpacking and base assembly was a breeze . Set up went off without a hitch . I don't think it could be any easier . And wow the picture is gorgeous . Tuned into a replay of the Bruins and Habs Hockey game from last night . Following the end to end action was a thing of beauty crisp , clear, with no blur .Next my Boy's wanted to try out the 2D to 3D .We turned on Mr and Mrs Smith to give it a try . I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was . While not to be confused with Movie Theater 3D, the effect was pretty impressive with very nice picture quality .I've read several reviews about the poor sound quality  . From where I sit it's more than adequate . We will most likely upgrade to a soundbar in the future . But for now it will certainly do.On to game play . My son selected MW3. To say he liked it would be the understatement of the year . When I asked for a grade he said 10 out of 10.  We may have some serious disagreements in the future as to who controls this set...Next we tried the internet aps which in all honesty will be the least used feature . With three Ipads , three Ipods , two I phones , and a P.C  I think we have the internet covered . APS and Google searches  were fast with no apparent issues .While I do not profess to be a techie , I have to say I can find nothing wrong with this DT60. All the bells a whistles work as advertised . Set up was easy . The set itself is beautiful . The sound  is very good and much better than I expected .Did I mention that THE PICTURE IS GORGEOUS !", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture", "Author": "ks girl", "ReviewID": "RGB31XWGQ51UM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Think I was the last person to get a flat screen.  Conversion from CRT was amazing, not to mention screen size.  Not an audiophile, but think the sound is quite good. Viewing from an extreme angle is ok, picture is still clear, but color does fade. Picture was good out of the box, but did a little tweaking over the next few days to get it perfect for me.
