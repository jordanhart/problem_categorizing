Out of the box it seems like a good value--light weight, clear picture--but it's NOT wi-fi enabled like I assumed.  Not a huge issue, because it's easy enough to move the router closer, but it's not very clear from the description.  Hooked it up to my new xbox and to my computer, and they all work well together right out of the box.Update 2/2/12I got a second router and set it up as a bridged client, FINALLY getting internet to this TV.  Surprisingly, there are a lot more apps on it than I thought--they're all accessible through Vudu and include Facebook, Picasa, TED Talks, and several news apps.  After 3 months of owning this TV, I'm far more satisfied than I thought I would be, and I'm upgrading my rating from 4 to 5 stars.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "*NOT* WiFi!!", "Author": "Michael Fowler", "ReviewID": "RUQWN0HU4JDE5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just got this on the Cyber-Sunday deal for only $250 so I shouldn't complain, but I'll bet I wasn't the only one who assumed that the built-in Internet apps meant this TV had WiFi capability.Nope!Get out your hyper-long RJ45 cables, because this puppy only works via Ethernet.

This 32 inch HDTV was a great purchase for $ 217.00 with free shipping through Amazon. The installation went up on the wall and the picture looks great. I did not notice any sound issues as some others had posted..... speakers sound good. One of the features I liked being that I recently canceled cable and set up a Antenna .. was this TV will allow you to see the signal strength for each channel. Amazon had the TV at my front door within 2 days of my purchase.....I am pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Value for the price!!", "Author": "Tammy Gada", "ReviewID": "R3NI9UV41OOPMQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this on the Black Friday lightning deals. TV out of the box was great, the only disappointing thing like many other people was that its not Wi-Fi enabled. You need to run Ethernet cables. I bought this for my daughter's room and she loves it, especially since the netflix feature is right on the remote.

Ayre", "ReviewID": "R3OFXXVDNLCAYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For us closet Luddites, this value-priced set (on sale) had alot to offer for the features, variety of connections and overall build quality.  It set up in 5 mins which I appreciated. Haven't tried out the NetFlix integration, but hope to start streaming this weekend. For those who want a sleek, budget-priced 32\"-inch LCD, I can recommend this set. Others have noted the tinny sound quality, but I prob couldn't afford a TV with better speakers that I would never use anyways.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "TV ok but no code to connect to Dish remote!", "Author": "angelwings4me", "ReviewID": "R3UZ88K33C1EZF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "None of the codes in the book of codes twelve bigillion has one that will work for this tv with Dish Network, the idea of having to use two remotes to operate this just may prove reason enough for a return, not to mention the sound really is bad. My old tube tv had just as good a picture and a better sound system for sure!  Does anyone have any ideas on how to get the proper code? Was online with Dish they don't have a clue and say it's up to the manufacturers to provide them with a code?

I love this TV because I can finally stream my Netflix movies without hooking up my laptop or some ROKU equivalent hardware. However, you do need to have an ethernet connection to a router. If you're next to one then there's nothing else to buy. If not, you will want invest in a repeater or powerline ethernet adapter. The decent adapters start around $60. Picture quality is crisp and rich. The speakers are substantially powered. It's a good size for my 10x10 room. You won't find any Internet Apps TV's at this price.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "DONT BUY THIS TV or BRAND!!!
