{"Reviews": [{"Title": "THE POSSIBLE SLEEPER HIT OF PLASMA TV'S THIS YEAR!", "Author": "Travis Deputy \"TheInsatiableBookReader\"", "ReviewID": "R27LZZF1D2Q72L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You know how it seems every year there's always this really great movie that flies under pretty much everyones radar and then finally gets lots of notice and recognition? Yeah, a sleeper hit. I suspect this beautiful plasma may fall in that catergory and for a couple of reasons. First, this Samsung is targeted towards the budget minded crowd. Even in this crappy economy people will still go out and pay boatloads of money for the latest tv technology, no matter the expense. Those good old credit cards and lines of credit. Nothing but trouble I tell ya! Secondly, most people who research a tv before buying one will read that you shouldn't buy a 720p television(this Samsung is) if it't 50 inches or bigger because the picture will not look that great. That may be true in the past, but not with this model. 720p looks stunning on this television from any viewing distance or angle. Lastly, when I stumbled across this plasma on ebay several weeks ago I knew zero about it. So I researched it and researched it and could find very little on it, including reviews. I don't know whether it's on there now, but Samsung didn't even have this awesome plasma listed on their website at the time. That is POOR marketing! So, yeah, possible sleeper hit.This television, as other reviewers have probably already noted on the net(not many reviews yet), is the stepup E model that replaces last year's very fine D class 450 and 490 models(check the reviews). I was actually considering buying a 43\" D490 model until I found this one. I had previously owned a 47\" LG progressive 3D television(LW6500 model) and it conked out in two months, so I knew I wanted another 3D tv and decided to try a Samsung since I'd always heard mostly great things about them. I was leery at first about the whole active 3D vs. progressive 3D debate. When I bought the 47 inch progressive 3D LG most of what I read said that progressive was the future of 3D and that it was the way to go. So, this is why I was skeptical of buying an active 3D plasma, like this Samsung model. Lay that skepticism and those fears aside! I've watched Avatar, RE:Afterlife, Tron, and Piranha on 3D and they all look mindblowingly magnificent. Crystal clear and lots of depth. No fluttering, ghosting images that I've read about. I don't know how active 3D fairs on other tv's, but the 3D on this model blows away the progressive 3D I had on the LG. There is absolutely nothing negative to say about the 3D picture. It's that good. Don't listen to the negativity about active 3D and 720p on bigger size plasmas. This tv plants those allegations on their face!Even right out of the box the picture looked really good on standard cable. Not visually stunning like the blu-ray picture it produces, but still darn good. It didn't really take much more than 5 minutes of tweaking with the remote to get the picture how I wanted it. I like that the remote is relatively small and not some big refrigerator with legs:) The only negative I can say about the remote, and it's a small one, is that when you change a channel, increase volume etc. you have to double press the button. The first time merely \"lights on\" the remote. Kind of annoying if you are not used to it. And not just the picture set up is easy either. Removing the tv from the box and installing the stand and hooking everything up took no more than 15 to 20 minutes.The sound on this Samsung is surprisingly good. Pretty much every tv I've bought has had crappy factory sound. I can't remember if it was Panasonic or Sharp that always seemed to have really good sound out of the box. Too many tv's to remember! In a small room(say 12x12) the sound from this tv is more than adequate. One much bigger and you may want to add a surround sound system of some sort, even if it's just a speaker bar system. The sound options are the one thing I haven't played with yet during the 12 days I've owned it. I guess that says a lot about the sound being fine. I will probably eventually tweak around with it and see if there is any mesmerizing bass waiting to be unlocked. Not likely;)The black levels are the best I've seen on a plasma with the exception of some the high-end $3000 jobs they have on display at Best Buy. And then the blacks were only noticeably better. Not $3000 better! From all I've researched on plasmas over the years, the major consensus on the best thing about plasma picture quality is the black levels. I have to disagree. The colors(reds, blues etc) that come out in Avatar and Tron are ridiculously surreal and ultra vivid! Even on standard dvd the colors are outstanding. I can't really comment on how the picture looks in a lighted room b/c I have mine in a small unlit room(one small lamp). Ninety-five percent of my viewing on this tv has been in the dark. The other 5% was with the lamp on. I can't tell any difference in the pic with the light on or off, except for maybe a slight glare.I guess my only \"real complaint\" with this tv is the fact that it only has 2 HDMI inputs. For me, though, this is a very minor complaint since I only need two and probably will for a while. I have a Playstation 3(doubles as my blu-ray player) and Xbox 360 hooked to it. I guess in the future if they release another gaming system that I have to have to go with aforementioned two then it might be a problem. I know some people will have a problem with this because for some reason they have to have 5 HDMI inputs! Also, I can't comment on anything internet related with this tv because I don't mess with that stuff. I couldn't(without looking it up) tell you whether this tv even has any kind of internet connectivity.Speaking of video games: they look visually gorgeous with zero framerate issues. Most recently I played Kingdoms of Amalur and Uncharted 3 and they look insanely beautiful with fantastic sound! I've used this plasma roughly 50 hours and so far have had no image retention issues(screen burn-in) and don't believe I will. This is my 4th plasma and I've played video games on all of 'em and had zero issues with burn-in. I believe this problem only rears it's ugly head when people don't use their ugly heads:) and go off and leave a movie or game paused for long periods of time. For crying out loud people! Turn the tv off if you're going to be away from it for an exteneded period of time.The bottom line: Get in on this tv early, so you can say you were there at the beginning when it reaches \"sleep hit\" status. Seriously, kidding aside. Buy this sweet little Samsung plasma because you WILL NOT find a better tv for the price that can produce this kind of picture, sound, looks, and features. This is an unbelievable price for a 3D tv this size. Especially one that has a picture this amazing. Sure you can go out and spend another $1500 or $$2000 fir a higher end tv, but you'll only get something marginally better. Be smart. Save your money. Buy this tv. Now! Thank you. This Sammy is everything I could ask for in a tv and more. I give it an overall score of 4.75 out of 5 or a 9.5 out of 10. If you miss out on this Samsung you'll missing out on a lot. Samsung makes excellent televisions. Proof of that couldn't be anymore evident than here...Update:Forgot to mention that, the tv, when bought new, comes with 2 free pair of 3D plasses right in the box.

Pausing the tv for 10 to 15 mintues did not cause any issue.

This 2012 E model is better and has a beautiful picture that makes you forget all about the fact that you are watching a 720P TV. Truthfully, I can't tell that there's that much difference at all.Likes: everything. remote is smaller and easier to use. screen is outstanding. picture is flawless. sound is great. etc.Dislikes: the only dislike that I have between the two models is the screen zoom feature. The 2011 model had a three stage zoom for eliminating the black lines and this 2012 model doesn't. It simply has a 16.9 and widescreen which is full zoom. The full zoom is good for movies but bad for cable tv because it spreads where you can't see the channel or page info.Other than that this TV is a steal at $700 and I would recommend it o anyone!", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG TV'S!", "Author": "Calvin", "ReviewID": "R1FK9B7I8BXW0U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this set about 18 months ago and now the TV will not power on anymore.

For the most part it's a really cool television. Certainly several steps up from the 32' 720P Vizio which sits quietly and unused in a bedroom. There are some caveats, specifically having to purchase Samsung's whatever you call it wireless dongle. FYI, this set doesn't offer internet connectivity \"fun stuff\" aside from being able to update the software orrrr receive DLNA based \"whatever.\" What it does offer is 3D at a reasonable price and a lighted remote. Still getting used to it but have watched beyond too many 3D titles to post. Will say this, at 720P, hadn't felt the loss of 1080P. Or maybe my eyes aren't good (!) In the beginning (as it were) the novelty of having a larger set that was 3D capable and had \"real black\" kept us clicking our heels buuuut the limited sound and picture options (there are 3, Dynamic, Standard and Movie) kind of jerked reality back into errr, reality. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, just have to either read the manual or search for better ways to calibrate - I'm too lazy... 2 HdMI connections were plenty for me, since purchasing 3D + internet capable 3D blu-ray player(s.) Typed errrs because started with Samsung's BD-E5900 which didn't offer enough online video content, moved to Vizio VBR337 which pretty much offered the same and settled for a Sony BDPS590. Here are a few 3D titles in no particular order that have been watched. Avatar, looked okay but for some reason doing a 2D to 3D with the original 2D BR version looked better. Not sure why...Avengers 3D - blown away and is a personal favorite. Titanic 3D looks beyond the word \"cool\" watched it twice in a row just because it was that 3D cool. Abraham Lincoln vs Vampires? Also a really neat movie to watch on this particular set. As was with the 2 Journey to the Center of wherever and any IMAX 3D. Overall it was a good purchase (read cheap) and haven't thought about short changing from 1080P. Then again don't know because well, don't have 1080P! Now that I type(d) about it, there are many times when display will show that what's being viewed IS 1080P but whatever... Had TW cable for several weeks and HD channels were as spectacular as Terri Hatcher's and they're real Seinfeld episode but couldn't justify paying for cable services when there are many an online options thru the Sony BR player. If you can get past the idea of 720 over 1080 well then I say don't be scared+shhhh this set'll get you through not having to sink the purse or wallet and is 3D capable. Me?

I've had one for less than 2 years and its already broken. I didn't even use it very often. My primary TV is a Vizio, supposedly a less quality product, that I keep in my bedroom and has lasted wonderfully for over 5 yrs. The Samsung, I used maybe twice a month and so with probably less than a couple hundred hours of use on it has already failed. On a rare occasion last week I was watching it and it suddenly turned off and wouldn't turn on again, making wierd clicking noises over and over again. After it broke, I googled Samsung and clicking noises and it seems they've had large numbers of TVs break due to capacitor issues, but mine is not a covered model.. The price was right on it and the features were good while they lasted but it failed with extremely low usage after less than 2 years. I called customer service which is always a long process, about 45 minutes total and then the number the woman gave me to call for service did not pick up and had a full Voicemail box...

Very,very,very diappointed.Just to get started, you have no contoll of resolution. When setup with HD cable box. What ever they send is what you get, there are no up scaling options for formatting.For that matter no options. When you set up from cable box HD to TV with a HDMI ,when you connect an optical cable from TV to your receiver or home theather . You will only get a PCM singnal out put. PCM is an analog uncompressed signal, another words you can only get a netural stero sound . You can't get a 5.1 channel such as Dolby Digital as advertised.Half the joy of watching a movie is the the sound. That half is lost. Pitcure is OK but my old front projector with 540p max. and 1080i resolution gave me the same quality. It was just big and bulky.Because the TV functions and not broken ,I'm stuck with it. The cost of shipping back and restocking are costly.So I have a very exspensive boat anchor. As they always say, buyer beware!!!I have now owned this TV for 6 weeks. There was a firmware update for the All Share program Down loaded and installed as directed. Now the All Share doesn't work. Contacted Sasung on April 6th. Only way to fix, is with a usb flash drive with new firm ware. They said will sent one to me as soon as possible. It is now April 20th and still no flash drive. I was told it was sent by 3 different people. Was even told would be here on the 19th, twice. Worst service ever. I wouldn't believe one word they tell me at this point.
