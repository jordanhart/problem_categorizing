BUT", "Author": "Jarrod", "ReviewID": "R25VKX12AA8H5C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do not have the football version of this monitor. However I'm considering it. I have been using I-Inc (hanspree) H283 Monitors for several years and I cannot suggest them enough. They are priced cheaper than the competition by a considerable amount. The picture quality is amazing and runs at 1920x1200 resolution. For some crazy reason they have discontinued the 28\" monitor that I have come to love and am considering buying a football TV to use as my monitor assuming it's the same thing. I don't watch football but what else can I do? maybe they have a baseball or basketball version?", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Football TV", "Author": "Clare", "ReviewID": "R3QEG9IJATU7RA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The tv looked great,felt and looked like a real football,nobody has it,around here.Nice item.Will tell others about this item.

I gave it a 2 because when it did work the picture and show was great for the price. When i began having problem with the tv they asked me to send it in for repairs and it cost me more to ship in than I paid for the actual tv. I called to inform them and they told me i was out of luck because they send out no services instruction so no one but their tech support could service the tv. I will not purchase anything else from this company it was a waste of money because we only had the tv less than a year!", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Will buy more as we grow our business.", "Author": "Harold Thompson", "ReviewID": "R2II1NDUX7LVJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are using 7 Hannspree TV's in our business .The best units we have every used with no trouble.

Not only is the texture on the tv feel like a real football it looks like one too EXACTLY!! I love the fact that it is boyish and fun looking besides that the picture is completely clear and beautiful! Everybody wants to be in my grandsons room now to watch tv on is football tv!! The best thing also is we ordered on Dec 9th and it arrived on the 12th! How fast is that!! That was a big plus! I am glad we ordered this because we got a GREAT deal! It was on sale at the time so we only paid 199!! Best price I found anywhere!! The tv stand that you connect to the tv for the base is SO sturdy, That also made me feel a lot better that it wasn't some plastic base and I don't have to worry about it falling over! It is so strong and made of metal and it has 3 options for the tv view, It lays all the way back middle or upright!! I would totally recommend this tv for anyone! You can't go wrong and you wont regret it!!", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for sports themed bedroom!", "Author": "Cheryl Clark Paine", "ReviewID": "R26J4HSPYJE9XN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for my Grandson for Christmas.
