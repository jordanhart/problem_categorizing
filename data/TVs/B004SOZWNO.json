Out of the box the picture was good. After dialing it in it now looks great. The audio is ok so I added my Denon surround system and the movies came alive. I love the wireless connection no wires to run or hook up to watch Netflix or my laptop. I have all the other brand names in other rooms and they all have their issues. This TV is a good buy with a better than average picture.And a great price. what else could you want??", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "TV", "Author": "Brian J.

The only drawback is there is only one set of component inputs. We havent used the net tv much and have not streamed any movies. The buttons on the remote are horribly placed but what remote isnt???", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best in class", "Author": "Marcus Aurelius \"Marcus\"", "ReviewID": "R3O5EBI6SFMIII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use to buy SONY tvs always, until I changed to PHILIPS.It is better in all categories, and the best image I have seen on a tv.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV.  No issues at all.", "Author": "Samuel T. Thornton", "ReviewID": "R2QQKOP4GKWSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I selected this TV after side by side comparison with essentially all of the major brands.  The picture is as good as any, and better than most.I hooked it up (with good instructions), turned in on, and all was perfect.A couple of really great things is that this TV has a composite video input, which many of the latest models do not.  It also has a digital audio output.  With those two things, I was able to connect my TV to a really good receiver which is not HDMI.  With most of the other brands, I would have had to replace my receiver.Hats off to the designers!!  A fine TV.", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV", "Author": "AC1982", "ReviewID": "R2O623ELIE40PC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV has a great picture and sound, and the Netflix works great.

You can surf the internet, but you cannot enjoy videos in flash. For example no video.pbs.org to watch the NewsHour.The RAM is too small which makes it slow.Recommend:buy a large monitor for your PC & upgrade.Philips in this case can be an expensive mistake.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "So So  Picture", "Author": "M. ZAK", "ReviewID": "R20ARX69QCTTQR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My wife recently got me this TV as a birthday gift. Really excited about the Tv until I turned it on. The picture quality is no better, and might be a little worse,  than my old 37 Vizio. Im not a technophile so I'm unfamiliar with much of the language used when describing TVs. I am a regular guy who knows what looks good and what doesn't. The picture on this model doesn't. The TV takes a good 15 seconds before it turns on. When watching sports u see a blur now and than, especially when watching fast action like hockey. Really wish I can like this TV but just can't.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "55 inch class widescreen full HD LED display\n1920x1080p resolution and 178 degree viewing angle\nPixel Precise HD for extremely sharp and clear pictures\nBuilt-in wireless Internet TV\nPhilips Wireless MediaConnect and Net TV services", "Name": "Philips 55PFL4706/F7 55-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED LCD HDTV with Wireless Net TV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B2mGXtSIL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004SOZWNO"}}
