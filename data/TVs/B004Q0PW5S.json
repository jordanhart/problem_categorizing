It died about two months later and, now going on week 5 of the warranty claim process, no one seems to be able to tell me any progress is being made.Video was excellent, audio was a bit below par, and the company has as of yet to show any usefulness.Edit Update: It took around 8 weeks to get through the warranty process. They have no notification system so you have to keep calling customer service for updates (many of which will be 'in processing'). They lost my paperwork once, but were fairly quick to find it when I told them exactly to whom and when it was e-mailed. In the end they replaced the unit with a refurbished one that seems to be working fine. Here's hoping that I won't have to do this again in two months.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a great price!", "Author": "Jeff Jones", "ReviewID": "RV03XO42LKBI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this TV on Black Friday.

I was a little skeptical about Haier because I had never heard of the brand. However, after 4 months of use it is great. HD Quality is great and it has 3 hdmi inputs and looks sleak.

Frost", "ReviewID": "R202PMMVE7DEVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This set is priced like a low end model, but has high end features. Ten different inputs means you can connect anything, and three of them are on the side for easy temporary connections. There is also a USB connector that can use a 4GB storage device to playback JPEGs and MP3s. It can also record and playback TV programming, although simplistically. Picture is great and sound is fine, though there are audio outputs for an external sound system.I liked it so much I ended up with two.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very happy with this TV", "Author": "Mr Niceguy", "ReviewID": "R13M4V1OBNVMT9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on-line from Visions Electronics in Canada. It was on sale for $369.99. I do not have any High Definition TV channels but the picture looked good even with my Standard Definition (480i) digital cable box which I connected to one of the TV's two S-video inputs. I have the TV in my bedroom and I am watching it from a distance of 8 feet. I can not say anything about the audio quality, since I use an external home theater audio system instead of the TV's built-in speakers.I do like the fact that the TV is full high-definition (1080p) capable, which will be important if and when in the future, I decide to subscribe to some high definition TV channels.I also like the fact that this TV has a LOT of inputs! For connecting high-definition devices, the TV has 4 H.D.M.I inputs. It also has 2 component video (red/green/blue cable) inputs as well as 2 additional inputs which can be used with either composite video (yellow cable) or S-video devices. In fact, this TV was the only TV I could find with S-video inputs, since most TV manufacturers no longer include S-video inputs on their TVs. The TV even has a U.S.B port as well as a V.G.A port for connecting your PC. I also like the fact that some of the inputs are at the rear of the TV and some are on the side. I found that the TV did not achieve the best picture quality with the preset video settings (standard, economy, vivid, movie, etc) so I did have to tweak the video settings to my preference, but once that was done, the picture looked pretty good!Overall, this is a great TV for a very low price!", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Practically a steal", "Author": "Keesh", "ReviewID": "R1P1PD12YUQNFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great picture, sturdy base, arrived without any damage.
