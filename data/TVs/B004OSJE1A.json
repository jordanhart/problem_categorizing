{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Must login to WiFi every time, No Amazon VOD...otherwise, it's great", "Author": "Marty McCall", "ReviewID": "R1NU0FMCV2T1G8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Right off, here are my two big beefs with this TV.First of all, the TV absolutely, positively will not remember network settings.  Every time the TV goes off, it forgets my wireless network ID and password, and I get to start from scratch the next time I turn it back on.  I've never seen that in a wireless device before.  It's to the point where I get a little angry whenever I use the TV -- generally speaking, not a good sign for a product.It's especially aggravating, since Smart TV features demand you login to the network, even if you're not going to use anything that requires a network collection (like watching a video through a USB hard drive).  Skip the login, and it kicks you right out of the Smart TV app entirely, and you have to restart it.Looked online for a solution, with no joy.  Found several people with the same problem, no solution.  The Samsung site suggested contacting customer support.So contact Samsung support I did...and they were atrocious.  Spent 30 minutes going through an assortment of power cycles and system resets that accomplished nothing.  Then they proclaimed that there was \"definitely something wrong,\" and that I should call the following number...and then gave me the number I'd just called!  I told them that was the number I was speaking to now, and they insisted it wasn't, and that I needed to call that number.So I called it again, and got another rep, who tried to run me through the exact same process; I told rep #2 that I'd just done all those things, and they said they could see that (I was already in their database, having called a few minutes earlier), but this was all he could do.  And that's where I gave it up as a bad job.Seriously.  Awful.  Service.The other beef I have isn't really Samsung's fault, but it does diminish the value of the product: no support for Amazon VOD or Amazon Prime VOD.  No ETA for it either, as far as I can tell.  There's other apps missing too -- NBA, NFL, but the Amazon one hurts the most.Those gripes aside, the TV's great.  Awesome picture.  The Motion Plus stuff is aggravating, but easily disabled.  Sound's a little on the low side, but loud enough most of the time; we've had to plug in an amp on occasion, just to hear certain quieter movies.  Teeny tiny bezel, which makes fitting it into our TV alcove possible; no other 46\" inch would have been able to replace our old TV, a 46\" Samsung DLP.I'm not sure if everyone's experiencing the network problem too; I'm guessing not.  But if you end up being one of them, my condolences.  I figure at this point I'm stuck with it, and may need to buy a wireless access point, just to eliminate the occasional impulse to put my foot through the screen to avoid needing to punch in my WEP key one...more...time.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "A solution to your WiFi problems", "Author": "Dennis", "ReviewID": "R21YEFULYU2A6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV Samsung Model: UN46D7900 and also the 55 inch!To permanently maintain it's WiFi connection with the in House WiFi Router, you first have to get the MAC Address from the TV.Once you have that,now go log into the House Wifi Router usually 192.168.1.1 and also TYPE ADMIN for Name ID and PASSWORD for PW.Unless you have properly secured your own WiFi Router then you would use your secret ID and Password.Now you need to find Devices in the Router and simply enter the TVs MAC Address there to allow it access.After that is done,every time you turn the TV off and back on,you'll have access because the Router has already stored the TVs Address.I set this up for my Sisters Husband and he has not had a single issue with it.Same scenario with iPods,iPhones,or anything else wireless in the House.Hope this helps those frustrated with this issue.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply Amazing!", "Author": "The Rick", "ReviewID": "RLSNAA2WD7UO4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well after having the TV to play with all day today I would have to say that I am thorough impressed.

Initially everything seem to be working properly.  However, after about two weeks the Qwerty side of the remote control would no longer pair with the TV.  Additionally, once I purchased compatible 3D glasses, the 3D glasses could not be paired with the TV.  After checking all of the manuals and the TV operations I contacted Samsung.  It was determined that the blue tooth functionality of the TV was not working.  I also attempted to search for the blue tooth on my phone and nothing for the Samsung could be located.So the customer service representative said they would have a technician come out to service the TV.  This is already an issue for me, since it is a brand new TV that is now defective.  The first technician company that contacted me, refused to come out because they were more than 60 miles away.  Why would Samsung refer them my service request?  So I had to contact Samsung again to have a new service ticket opened.Another technician came out and after about 10 minutes messing around with the remote said he could not do anything and would have to take the TV back to the shop for 5 days as it is possible a new board would need to be ordered?  Another unsatisfying experience.  So I thought they would have known that was the problem after I went through this with the Samsung customer service representative.  Why wouldn't they have already ordered a replacement part.  So I didn't let them take the TV.  I wanted them to order the part (again they don't know exactly what was wrong, because the technician didn't do any trouble shooting beyond playing around with the remote control), and let me know once the part arrived.  And now I would have to bring the TV to the shop as they will not make a repeat trip.  Totally dissatisfied.

After Calibration", "Author": "Hsin Pai \"Consumer Extraordinaire\"", "ReviewID": "R3RNGZLLOQ1C9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replaced a three year old Samsung LN46A750 which has a terrific picture with a Samsung UN55D7900.  I chose the UN55D7900 over the UN55D8000 because it has a slightly thicker frame, which appears to eliminate some of the reported backlighting issues because of the thinner frame.  After setting up the new UN55D7900 I was very disappointed with the initial picture quality ... too blurry in spots and overly sharp/grainy in others.  I thought I had made a mistake in upgrading to this set, only to find the picture substantially inferior to my old tv and considered returning it.  I researched the internet and found very little information on calibrating the UN55D7900.  However, I did find several sites for calibrating the UN55D8000 which is basically the same tv except for panel thickness.  Following the most popular settings from CNET and making a few of my own adjustments, I'm very pleased with this tv.  The bluriness and graininess are gone.  Picture is smoother and more uniformally sharp and has excellent color and warmth.  At first I found the picture mode: movie, too dim, but after making all of the adjustments, found it to be just about perfect and easier on the eyes, especially in low lighting.  I had an initial tendency to over brighten/over contrast the picture to pull out detail, but the picture rendered is too harsh.  Following are the final adjustments that worked for me.  It's worth playing around a little to get a better feeling for what you like.  If you don't like it, you can always hit the 'reset to factory standard' at the end of the list.Below you'll find the settings that optimize the Samsung UN55D7900 in a dim room via HDMI input at 1080p/60 resolution.

After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.

I feel robbed of $2,900.00The repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....basically, buy another TV.SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at 20% per year, and they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!

As you watch tv in absolute darkness (at night) you will notice slight \"lighting\" of the areas of the screen that are supposed to be completely black (I don't know if micro-dimming was supposed to help this). Not intrusive or distorting, but was expecting better blacks from a $1600 tv.The image flow on this screen is absolutely phenomenal and my wife and I have noticed a sense of depth of image (viewing 2D movies) that we had never experienced on any other set.All the apps work fine, but as many other reviews have pointed out, there is no app for Amazon prime on demand video. This was dissapointing but I just plugged my Roku into one of the HDMI ports and that took care of it. Again, not a deal breaker, but Samsung should get a bit smarter about these things. Hopefully it will come in a software update (I called and requested it).I have also experienced trouble with the qwerty keyboard using Apps such as Youtube. I waited to buy this tv for the keyboard remote, so I was a unhappy to see that some apps don't recognize it and you have to use the 4-way rocker to select the letters and write that way (very time consuming; not to mention annoying as you actually have a keyboard that SHOULD work).Overall I gave it 4 stars because TVs are mostly for seeing TV, movies, etc and that it does well.If I were inclined to use all the internet functionality more than I do and cared less about image quality, I would probably lower the rating to 3 stars.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exactly as advertised", "Author": "Bigboats", "ReviewID": "R1I0FQR32O89D2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this TV two weeks back after watching the price for well over 3 months.

The \"Smart TV\" UI is a horrible abomination of UI/UX design. It's just a bad ripoff of Apple iPad icons and Apple TV. But it's not done nearly as well and is quite slow.

Except for this one GLARING mistake, we think that it is a great concept for a TV.Update: 11/22/2011: A new firmware update has left the streaming from our media server really choppy. So, much so that we had to go back to using our old Media Player and we no longer use the in-built one on this Smart TV. I have updated this review with a comment and am copying some excerpts from the comment here, so that people can understand the situation:\"Out setup is a Mythbox that records TV as well as movies and then we view it later on our Smart TV.\"So the whole scene is as such:\"We have a media server that serves TV recordings and movies over our wired network and we used to have a Western Digital Media Player that would feed those to our old TV. With this new SmartTV we replaced that, but soon found that it was not able to stream files over 4GB. What's worse is that with a new firmware update, we have choppy streaming now... so the stream starts fine, then gets choppy and ultimately hangs.
