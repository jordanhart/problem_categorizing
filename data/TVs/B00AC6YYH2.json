The salesperson said that the Insignia line is built specifically as a Best Buy brand. While it is a smaller low-cost TV, I chose it because the size of the cabinet allowed me to place it in a shelving unit. I connected the TV to the wall outlet of my cable service and the initial setup was normal. The manual that comes with the TV does not explain much about the settings. With a bit of fiddling (learn as you go) in the \"advanced settings\" menu, I managed to get a reasonably good quality picture. However, the TV has a serious problem with \"input lag.\"  Upon pressing the channel change button on the remote control, the new channel number shows up instantly on the upper right corner of the screen, but there is a time lag of 2-4 seconds before new the picture shows up. This is unacceptable to me as it takes a very long time to surf through the channels. On the Internet, I saw several articles on how the input lag issue was resolved on other TVs but they did not help to resolve the problem on my TV. I called Insignia customer service twice.  Both times, the initial contact individual claimed it was a problem of cable signal or some other problem. After talking at some length with a supervisor, I was told that it is a characteristic of the TV as it is slow to synchronize with the signal on a new channel.  To be fair, other cheaper brands on display at Best Buy also had a serius input lag.  My resolution to my problem is to return the TV to Best Buy and look for different, smaller and probably more expensive, brands in various stores.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy.
