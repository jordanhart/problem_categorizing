When you do this it's of course 'best' to be playing music, music dvd IS BEST.If you SET the preset equalizer setting to *FLAT OR OFF*... you will be able to enter and customize the settings on your (*bass & treble*) levels.Don't hesitate to play around with the sound settings, one click will return it to the factory settings.You will require a lower volumn level, significantly lower... the audio quality IS dynamic and intense for this TV.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice TV -  good price", "Author": "James C. Kelley", "ReviewID": "R1HPTDUUZDKCWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for the 32\" and the 47\" Vizio as I have recently bought one of each. As far as I can see the menus, remotes and operations of the two units is identical. The screen size is the only difference.The picture is bright and sharp on both units. The 47\" is hooked to 1080 HD (I use DishNetwork HD receiver) via HDMI cable and it is impressive - as you might expect for HD. The 32\" is hooked to the coaxial input distribution system I use at my home and it is also a top notch picture for a simple coaxial cable hookup. However, please note that there is NO S-Video input at all and the COMPOSITE input (single yellow RCA cable) simply plugs into one of the three RGB COMPONENT RCA inputs. That's maybe a bit confusing but not a deal breaker for me.The remote is full featured as it controls screen size, input selection, Closed Caption and the like with dedicated buttons. Very convenient. The remote also accesses an extensive menu system that allows detailed adjustments of audio and video. Also found in the menu is a JPG viewing feature that allows you to watch slide shows and sort photos by plugging in a common USB drive. I plug the SD card from my camera into a USB card reader adapter, plug it into the Vizio, and review my photos right out of the camera. The USB jack on the rear left is a little difficult, but not impossible, to get to if the TV is flush mounted on a wall.PROS - these are not top of the line TV's, but I am of the opinion that most TV's have a pretty good picture if set up correctly. I use an Avia DVD to calibrate and it really does make a difference. I never use factory or preset audio or video settings - I turn them all off. More on that later as it pertains to complaints about poor audio performance from some reviewers. Also, the manual is written well and is useful and concise. I address the audio issues below but can say that the small stereo speakers on this TV sound pretty good although a bit weak in the deep bass. (Please note that anyone running this TV via HDMI but not using a surround audio system is missing half the fun of HD TV - namely the great stereo or 5 channel audio now available on most HD channels).CONS - I have noticed that once or twice the TV has turned off when I hit the EXIT button on the remote. While clearly a harmless software glitch, it has happened so infrequently that I debated even mentioning it. However, some others may have had more serious trouble with that issue so in the interest of full disclosure I mention it here.There are also complaints from reviewers concerning audio being too loud, too soft, and the volume going up and down! Folks, please turn off all audio enhancements on your receiver/cable box and the TV. Useless stuff with silly names like \"Super Surround\", \"Big Bass Synthesizer\", \"Wide Sound Enhancer\" \"Video SuperSharp\" and other useless factory settings should be turned off and left off! Check you receiver, your Vizio menus, and anything else in the signal chain and turn all of that extra crap off. Think about it, if you have both the receiver and the TV doing strange things to the pure, clean digital audio/video feeds - there is no telling how all those settings may affect each other. Did I mention turning off all audio/video helpers, enhancements and conditioners? If you want big sound buy a 5.1 surround system. Even the cheap ones sound pretty good these days and watching HD TV without 5.1 surround is like eating Oreos without any milk. This also explains why some of us really don't care how the TV sounds as we never use our TV speakers/audio at all!COMPARISON - my cheap 47\" Vizio looks better than my neighbors very expensive 50\" Sony TV. We both have DishHD service, we both use an HDMI cable and are using 1080i resolution. Why does my cheap tv have a better picture? Simple - buy or borrow a calibration disk and take 30 minutes to set up your TV - then write down the settings for future use if needed. I use an Avia but there are others just as good. IMHO most people would be hard pressed to tell the difference between these TV's and the high priced units some people buy - particularly if the video is calibrated correctly. If browsing in a showroom, be careful to ignore picture brightness as a selling feature as every TV salesperson knows that uninformed buyers will go for the brighter picture every time.Lastly, please be kindly advised that any digital HDMI or Fiber Optic cable will provide pristine, perfect audio and video feeds. The nature of digital means that the cable either works or it doesn't! The cheap HDMI cables sold here at Amazon and elsewhere will provide exactly the same 1080iHD picture and 5.1 audio as the \"Super Monstrosity Mega\" cable for ten times more money. Sales people may tell you different, they may even believe their lies, but I have no reason to lie to you as I don't want to sell you anything. One caveat though - if you are running a long HDMI cable run (say 25 feet or longer), you could have trouble trying to use a super cheap HDMI cable.I really appreciate the thoughtful reviews of others as a valuable buying tool and I hope this review has helped you too.

This was to be used in the sunroom...which we could fit a 26 or a 32 in the spot.  I also bought two Vizio Razor LED 26\" http://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-M260VA-26-Inch-Class-RazorLED/dp/B003LL17HK at the same time for bedrooms (all pre-black Friday specials).Living with all of them for four days...and I can see why this is rated 3/5 stars.  3 stars is generous.I am using cable through RF.  No cable box.  The sound issues I noticed is flipping between standard definition channels and HD channels.  For example, watching two football games.  If I go from an SD channel like ESPN to HD (local ABC), the sound on the HD channel is much lower.  I have to jack the volume up on the HD channel, then when I flip back to ESPN, it's way too loud.ABC HD is 13-1 and ABC SD is 13.  I proved the sound issue flipping back and forth between the two while a song was playing on the station... huge difference in sound.This is with TruVolume on....TruSurround on.  Honestly, I didn't play too much with the audio settings like another reviewer suggested because I shouldn't have to.  TruVolume should level out the sound between channels and commercials...and it apparently doesn't work.Another annoying thing is there is a delay when changing channels.  You flip up one channel...it delays 2 seconds...shows the picture and then delays another second to start sound.  Sounds minor until you start flipping channels and realize the annoyance...we had a cheap AOC LCD TV that did something similar...which is why I will never buy an AOC TV again.The Razor LED TV hooked up to the same RF cable does not have this delay...the picture and volume come up in a second simultaneously.  Also, the sound difference is much less...there is one, but its minimal and you don't have to change the volume level.The picture is not quite as nice as the Razor LED...but pretty good.  I did not try this with our DVR...but if you are hooking this up to a cable box and bypassing the tuner, you might not have these issues with sound and channel changing delay.  I don't want to have to rent another cable box to make this TV work. Plus I am not buying a computer monitor, I am buying a HDTV with a tuner that should work better.I like the Razor LED's, so this just appears to be a bad model in their line.  The Razor LED 32\" is a 1080p set (http://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-M320VT-32-Inch-1080p-Backlighting/dp/B003PGX0VM/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1289411221&sr;=1-1) and a bit more than we want to spend.  I saw that in a store and it's nice.So four days in...and although 32\" is significantly bigger than 26\"...it's already at UPS tonight on its way back.  I'll use one of the Vizio 26\" Razors as it's just a much better overall TV.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great! T.V. ....Just (READ) your manual people.....", "Author": "Q.

Do not buy if you will be using the built in TV Tuners!", "Author": "Glenn", "ReviewID": "R2MHBBTGCY70P4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked this TV up for about $270 on sale. For that price, I think it was worth it. The picture quality is beautiful (minus standard def channels, which look horrific), the sound is more than adequate (I use it in a bedroom and can't really tell though), the viewing angle seems to be wide, and there are plenty of inputs. I do have quite a few pet peeves about the E320VA that I feel should be pointed out though:1. Volume fluctuates wildly if SRS TruVolume is on. Turning it off is a one-time, easy enough fix (just go into the sound menu).2. Rear inputs are designed HORRIBLY. There is very little room between the inputs and the case itself. This is notably troublesome if you're trying to use an antenna or cable straight from the wall, as stiff coaxial cable will have a very hard time bending into the area where the inputs are. The HDMI inputs weren't skimped on. They are very easily accessible, but are on the left side of the TV, which makes for an eyesore if you have multiple things hooked up via HDMI.3. Speaking of antennas and cables out of the wall, DO NOT BUY THIS SET IF YOU INTEND TO USE EITHER METHOD OF RECEIVING TV WITH THIS SET. The included tuner(s) is/are junk. It takes ages to switch between channels, and the ATSC tuner has trouble converting 1080i signals (used with some major broadcast channels, such as ABC/NBC) for use with this 720p set. Every few seconds, the picture freezes up for a splitsecond. This is EXTREMELY annoying and is not a problem with signal strength. Also, if you don't have the coaxial cable in the TV positioned perfectly, lips have trouble syncing up. Anything that uses HDMI cables thankfully bypasses the terrible tuner.4. The remote is of SHOCKINGLY bad quality. Some buttons can barely be pressed at all. Not a problem if you're only using a cable/satellite box.5. The \"normal\" picture mode leaves a few rows of pixels which display oddly (I'm guessing these pixels aren't used in the original broadcast image). \"Widescreen\" mode horribly distorts standard def images.6. The TV has randomly shut off a few times on me when I've been browsing the menus, but it has been a while since it last occurred. It has randomly shut off completely in the middle of playing a video game through one of the HDMI ports.7. Take this last complaint with a grain of salt, as I do not know the exact cause of my problem. Many times (10+) while playing on my Xbox 360 connected through an HDMI cable, I've had my sound die. Muting and unmuting solves the problem. I'm pretty sure the TV is at fault, but I suppose the 360 or HDMI cable could be the culprit (though I think the signs point towards the TV).", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture! good sound! ...not sure about the quality of the materials...", "Author": "The piano guy", "ReviewID": "R2K1K7FQNBG77G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reviewing and much consideration I bought this HDTV... in a few words: if your looking for great HD picture quality, it does the job! remember is not full 1080p HD... but hey... 720p is not bad at all for a 32\" screen size. I don't have cable or satellite service, I simply get HD signal from regular air TV and of course most of the channels don't transmit in HD, but the main networks do and the picture is really impressive. I have read a lot of bad reviews about sound issues with this model, as for me, sound is very good, loud enough, true surround option is really cool, and if you take some time to read the manual or just get to know the menu options you can get pretty decent sound settings.The only thing I'm not sure about this model, or, if I may say about VIZIO is the quality of the materials they use to build their products, the \"plastic\" or whatever the material is called that surrounds the screen, like the main frame looks kind of weak, and in the few weeks I've had this TV, I have already noticed some dents, I'm not sure if I caused them myself while unpacking the TV... anyway, if you're like me and you put your dollars in high consideration when making a decision to buy something, it may be worth it.

First scene involves a lot of shooting and it was loud, I mean really loud. Finally the shooting ends and there is some dialogue, barely audible!

It's totally functional and it's never broken, but there are some issues.Issues:-Sound is the worst problem.  It is very hard to hear dialogue, so I end up turning the volume waaaay up to hear it, and even then it's still difficult.  But then if music or background noise in the show comes on, it's waaaaay too loud.  Like I said, I'm not a tech person, so maybe it's somehow possible to fix this, but I have never found a way.-Picture is ok, but not great.  When it's really bright in the room, it gets a lot worse.  Again, it might be possible to fix this if you know what you're doing, but I certainly don't.-Takes a long time to turn on and a long time to change the inputs.  When you turn it on, it takes several seconds to boot up.  More annoying is the inputs.  To change from one input to another you have to keep pressing the input button and scroll through all the inputs to get to the one you want (you cannot just select the one you want without hitting all the others first).  This is not a huge deal, but it's annoying if you switch inputs frequently (to switch to the Roku or the DVD player etc).So basically, it's not the worst TV out there, but I think that you could probably get a much better set for not that much more money.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "good tv good price", "Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "R3MFSZ72SSYD1A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "good price vizio is the best least expensive brand, the new ones are alot better but not bad for the price", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad, Keep away", "Author": "Szalony", "ReviewID": "R289UGO2DSQYS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Where do we start.

There is a LOT said about audio issues, but the sound on this is remarkably clear and gets plenty loud.  I did turn the TRUSurround off but left everything else alone.  I don't like \"simulated\" surround sound, because if I want a home theater I'll buy a home theater system that's designed for that purpose.  I saw one review that said \"no sound on HDMI connection\".  That doesn't automatically mean the TV is bad and I'd recommend trying another HDMI cable if you have that issue.  I've seen picky TV's before and knowing that you can get an HDMI cable anywhere between 20 - 60 dollars and even less than 10 dollars, it's obvious that some may not be as good as others.  If there are issues with sound or picture (other than a dead pixel which obviously means it is a bad unit), you can mess with sound and picture settings to tune it to your preferences.  Not every TV will come ready to use out of the box with settings that EVERYONE will like.It has 4 HDMI connections, 1 Component video connection, 1 VGA and coax (cable/antenna).If there is ONE thing I wish this unit had, it is at least one set of audio/video inputs.Most gaming systems use the red/white/yellow A/V connection and none can be connected to this TV.  However, this is the era of HD devices so this TV is just keeping up with the latest trends and is perfect for use with an HD box and a Blu-Ray player and maybe a laptop with an HDMI connection.  Every brand has a bad unit now and then, but I don't think this is is a bad model, so for anyone who has issues with theirs, play with the settings and you'll be pleased.  Of course, as I said before, if you have a dead pixel just return it.***ADDED FEB 14TH***After increased use, we noticed that the picture seemed dull and dark, even after making several adjustments and even trying the \"Vivid\" picture mode that is used in stores.  I ended up exchanging this for the Panasonic TC-32LX24 at Costco, which has one less HDMI connection, but two a/v inputs and a component video input, as well as an SD input for picture viewing.  I spoke with someone at Costco who says that I probably just got a bad unit, possibly one with outdated firmware.  I noticed that the display model in the store looked great and far brighter and more vivid than the one I had returned, which is what led me to buy it in the first place.I chose to switch to Panasonic for a better variety of inputs and a better track record, and the price had been reduced so it was $20 less than what we paid for the Vizio.  Our other TV is a 42\" Panasonic plasma that is nearly 6 years old that still looks AMAZING and it's only 480P (enhanced definition) since we bought it when HD was still pretty new and a full HD model was $1000 more.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture and hard to beat for the price", "Author": "cthlaw", "ReviewID": "R3IIWR6OBNQES1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hook this up with to HDMI, kill the SRS sound adjustment in the menu selection for sound, and it's a great HDTV for the price.

I had read the reviews before hand but I thought I would try it out since Costco has a forgiving return policy.Overall I am dissatisfied with the product.  The picture is nice given you are on an HD channel-- if you're not using, the normal zoom will give you a smaller picture.  The distortion from using the \"wide\" setting is somewhat acceptable.  Viewing angle isn't bad but there is a noticeable difference especially if you get too low.As others have mentioned there are definitely some sound problems.  I should mention I am using standard cable (coax cable directly into the TV no cable box), so you might not have these problems with a cable box.  The volume equalization from truVolume is garbage; it doesn't even work-- the commercials are still way louder than the main program.  Like the other user the \"HD\" stations are much softer than the normalAnother beef I have with the TV is the channel searching.  The 50 some \"digital\" stations it found are blank channels with no picture or are not even available.  And the digital channels are not even numbered helpfully.  ie) the HD channel for 8 is 83-8 or 7 is 116-1.  There's no real way for me to figure this out except to channel up through each channel and figure out what it is manually and then add skips to those channels in the channel set up.Also connecting it up to a computer can be problematic.  It can only accept up to 768 px which resticts my computer to only a 800x600 output (not wide screen aspect ratio).  This is more a computer problem but it's something to consider if you were planning on playing video from your computer.In my opinion this TV is a waste of time and money especially if you don't have a cable box or HD subscription.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Weird....", "Author": "Lakshmi Dent", "ReviewID": "R13MVCRIRJ1RP3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is one of the strangest TVs that I've ever seen.It seems like Vizio wants to brainwash their customers.
