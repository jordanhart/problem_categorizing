Mousseau \"powermonkey24\"", "ReviewID": "R3MNZNRXUYLI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is supposed to be Sharps \"lower end\" TV in the their large TV line up, but it performs better then the its higher priced brothers. I have been through a few Tvs this model year. I have had the Sharp 847u, The Sharp ELITE, Panasonic VT50, Samsung pn64e8000, and Sony XBX929. I had all the heavy hitters from all the name brands and this TV can stand up to all of them no problem! I was very surprised at the black levels it can produce being an edge lit LED. I would say it is on par with the sony and samsung, but a click behind the ELITE and Panasonic. It is certainly a much better then its more expensive brother the 847 or the 745. Both of witch had bad clouding and bad black levels that left the picture flat and washed out. This TV has very good shadow detail giving you a very realistic picture in night scenes.Colors are very saturated and true to life, giving the Panasonic a run for its money and outdoing the ELITE to my eyes. This model does not feature Sharps Quatron extra yellow pixel, and I think it benefits from not having it. There always seemed to be something off with color on the Sharp models that had the extra yellow pixel, something I don't see with this TV. There is also no lack of color adjustment in the setting menu. I have plugged in CNET settings with a few minor tweaks to back-lighting, contrast, brightness and sharpness that suit my room and eyes better Overall the color reproduction on this TV if superb, as good as the plasmas I returned.Motion handling is very good to my eyes, better then the ELITE and hanging with the VT50. If you are one for de-judder processing or soap opera effect during movies this TV gives you full control of just how much smoothing you want with very tweakable controls. The TV can keep up with fast paced sports without pixelation or trailing images. Gaming is also a joy with no screen lag in game mode while playing fasted paced FPS games like MW3.These are just some of the high points of the Sharp 640u. Some other things to consider are its matte screen which greatly reduces reflections from ambient and direct light, the brightness is great, which also helps keeps black levels stable in bright rooms. The images are very sharp and detailed as well. This tv is a diamond in the rough! I am very amazed at the quality and pop of the image. I can safely say that this TV is overall maybe one click behind the ELITE and the Panasonic VT50, but for the price and size it can not be beat. Save some serious money and get this TV while still going big with 70 inches, you wont regret it.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just Like 3D in Your Face (even though it is not)...", "Author": "Steve N \"Straussjoe\"", "ReviewID": "R3M44EAEUVFDEV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi all!  My wife and I purchased this from RC Willey in Utah in April 2012. The average price for this unit is right at $1500.00. We were in for a 32\" or smaller (nothing special) to replace a TV that we lost in a flood last year. Well, after we saw this baby in a wall unit at RC Willey, we could not pass it up. We also purchased an oak console with four doors on the front and opaque glass to hide all of today's electronics (Xbox, PS3, Hybrid Digital Radio Receiver, Stereo Receiver, etc). Sorry, I digress. This television is IN YOUR FACE 3D quality, even though it is an LED 1080p, with a 120Hz refresh rate. (With today's fast special effects such as transformers, we wanted something a little faster than 60Hz so we could actually \"see\" the fast motion and not notice it as a blur.  This is the ticket!  You don't need 240Hz unless you got your eyes calibrated at the last robocon convention in Vegas). In addition, we do not have to stream videos from Amazon Instant Video though my Blu-Ray player as the internet is incorporated into the television. Quite incredible. We watch a lot of streaming movies from Amazon and Vudu at around 7Mbps @ HD and HDX. However, I must warn you...you will be turning your head from side to side with the fast action, even at a 10-foot distance from TV to sofa, as the screen is incredible large and crystal clear. I cannot wait until the 2012-2013 NFL season starts. One more thing...For all you NASCAR fans, the cars feel like they are going to come out of the screen.  When you get the \"dashboard\" view from the HD internal cameras, you will feel as though you are driving the car yourself (well, at least riding in it, anyway). In summary, you will be very happy with this model. We almost purchased another Sony Bravia or Samsung but the price, clarity, energy efficiency, inputs (that are endless), and overall product is nothing less than exceptional. Oh yes...for those of you who hate the shiny screen (similar to the PCs today and the shiny border, that catches every reflection when you move on the sofa), forget it; this TV has neither.

Cuba", "ReviewID": "R23J4OL5G1D9OU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I agree with most of the comments made by other reviewers here.  The apps, particularly Netflix, do not work great on this TV.  But that is not a problem at all for me.  I have my TV set up as a monitor.  It simply has to display the picture coming out of my sound system.  My cable box and bluray player feed into the sound system, and the sound system has an output for the TV's picture.  I use my bluray player's Netflix features, and prefer it that way. And I don't care about using the internet on my TV, either.This TV has a fairly nice picture.  I went to numerous electronic stores when shopping, and this TV looks pretty much the same as nearly all of the other 60\" LED sets, with one notable exception.  There is a Samsung (the one with the very thin frame around the screen and 4-legged base) that was just WAY nicer than everything else.  No matter which store I entered, that Samsung really stood out.  But the price was also quite a bit more.  I wasn't willing to spend an extra $500 for the Samsung.This Sharp is priced well and I am mostly happy with the picture quality.  My one criticism involves watching sports.  When a ball (or any other object) is moving quickly across the screen, it looks like a weird blur on my TV.  I believe another reviewer mentioned something about that, suggesting that you can correct this with the settings.  I will play with it and update if I find anything.If I were to do it all over again, I would still go with this TV.  ____*****  UPDATE 8/24/12  *****____I found the \"motion enhancement\" option under \"picture settings\".  I played with the three choices (high/low/off) and it looks noticeably better when set to \"off\".  When watching football, with motion enhancement turned on, the ball becomes a strange blinky blur when it is thrown quickly.  Basketballs don't usually move fast enough across the screen to cause the blur.  I don't watch baseball, but I am sure it would be a problem to.  I don't know what benefit motion enhancement offers, but I really dislike what it does to sports viewing.  With this said, although turning this feature off is an improvement, I can't recommend this TV if sports are important to you.  Even with the off setting, the fast motion picture quality is still not as good as I would like it to be. From what I hear, a 240hz (or higher) tv will have better fast motion picture quality._____*****  Update on 10/2/12  *****_____If you have this tv, make sure you play with the picture settings.  Lately I have noticed that the picture quality with all of the pre-programmed options was a bit lacking.  I played with the settings, and now it looks much nicer.  I made several changes, but the biggest improvements came from lowering the backlight a little, increasing the reds a bit and raising the sharpness all the way.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best bang for your buck hands down...", "Author": "Johnarhd", "ReviewID": "R3H2QM3C1GIAK7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased my LC-60LE640U about a month ago and I am still very pleased with the product. I viewed this model at BestBuy, the floor model was being featured directly next to a Samsung 60' LED model and I clearly saw the immediate difference between the two. The Sharp's images/picture quality and overall color accuracy IMO were far better than the Samsung being displayed next to it . I currently have a 52' Sharp Aquos in my man cave at home and love it. My wife and I wanted something a bit larger for our living room upstairs and this was absolutely perfect. Matte screen is definitely a plus as well, since our living room space has a good amount of light coming in but even so, there is very minimal glare if any at all. Overall, the clarity that this TV produces I feel is exceptional. The only problem that I did notice was with slight instances of motion blur during fast paced scenes and sometimes when objects criss-crossed each other during movies/shows. Again, this was NOT a deal breaker for me since it only happens every now and then and there are plenty of ways to reduce the blur with proper calibration. HD movies almost appear 3D like even though the TV is not. Images are extremely life-like and very detailed and crisp. I currently have FIOS as my cable provider and i must say most of the channels look excellent on this TV. NOTE>during sports events, primarily Football, Golf, Baseball, Soccor, and Hockey you may notice that the balls, pucks etc. may produce a \"double image\". I found that if you turn the motion enhancement from 120hz to off it will eliminate the the \"ghosting\" effect, especially when balls are flying or during slap shots in hockey or with any sport that has trajectory items being used. Basketball seems to be just fine. Can't think of anything else at this point, but i will say that anyone who decides to purchase this TV will undoubtedly be happy, not only in the beginning but in the long run as well.", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Bang for your Buck!!", "Author": "Dime-Bolt", "ReviewID": "R14BZCOZ3E43MR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Will make this short and sweet, because I did extensive research before considering a TV.  You cannot find a better TV out there currently for the price in my honest opinion.  Im a straight foward guy who simply wanted a bigger, nicer TV for football season, and didnt want to spend a fortune.  For 2 grand, you will not find a better TV.  The picture is very \"Sharp\", and the colors are amazing.  There are several preset picture settings which you can cusomize to your liking.  Just be sure if you get this monster, you have a big enough room.  You should be sitting at least 10 feet away from this TV.  Also, I would recommend hanging this TV, as it makes a huge difference.  I bought the omnimount ($50) on amazon.com.  It spans 3 studs and holds max 200lbs.  The TV weighs roughly 105lbs.  It aint going anywhere.  On the other hand, if you are one of these TV nerds that will analyze every megahertz, contrast ratio, dynamic lighting, etc., then go ahead, spend 9 grand on the new Samsung 75\" Smart TV, Better you waste your money than me!! lol  At the end of the day, ITS A TV, not a down payment on a car.

Smart tv apps would be a bonus but I was looking a tv not a computer. This tv fit the bill in every way and went above my hopes. There were tons of adjustments to make on the tv picture so for anyone saying the picture isnt good obviously didnt take the time to research and adjust the settings. My picture quality is amazing good and I would put it up against anything sony or sammy has to offer. TV had plenty of inputs for all of my equipment and works great.

There is no question that the image is incredibly clear.  The 120Hz 1080p really does a good job displaying fast action scenes without blurriness.That being said, Sharp has terrible Smart TV software.  To begin with, you will only be able to use Netflix and YouTube.  There is no browser and no app store.  So there is no way to add Amazon Prime (which is obviously important to me), Hulu Plus, or other apps.  Additionally, the Netflix button on the remote control only works half of the time.  What I mean is that I press the Netflix button and about half of the time there is an error connecting.  This problem does not occur on my laptop or my Roku box in the bedroom, so it's clearly a problem with the Sharp software.  After hooking up an XBox to the Sharp, no apps worked again until I manually reset the network (which required a tech support call).I could return the TV and get a Samsung, which I am told has better software.

I've been watching the Stanley Cup Finals now for last week, and the only complaint I have is the puck is slightly blurry when it's in fast motion, other than that, awesome picture.  The picture is crystal clear, and when watching a good quality HD channel or Blu-Ray, the picture is crystal clear with zero issues.  I initially copied the calibration settings of CNET after I googled them, but in the end I used the Disney World of Wonder Blu-Ray disc to calibrate, and got the picture dead on.  I also have to give props to Sharp themselves.  The day I got the tv home and connected, there was a small group of bright pixels on lower left of screen.  I contacted Sharp and sent them some pictures, and they scheduled a replacement within 5 days, great customer service.

Anyhow when we got the TV after weeks of delays we fired it up to check out the picture. We were very dissapointed. We already have Sony and Samsung HDTVs and both have far superior picture quality. No matter ho much we worked the picture settings it still looks as if you watch through a plastic film. The colors are dominated by hues of blue and the contrast as well as brighness are below par. I was looking forward to this set, but it turns out that our 2 year old Samsung is superior in every way except for the audio which is really nice on the Sharp (deserving the 2 stars). Hence if looking for a high quality crisp picture and a large screen this is not a great set. I think one is better off purchasing a Samsung 60 or 65\" version.I am improving my feedback on this Sharp TV, after some more tuning and Sharp help the picure is crisp. It's amazing what tuning with on-line help can do for the picture quality. If you get one please count on he need for improving the setings to satisfy your environment.

They dispatched a tech and he couldn't fix it there, so he took it away. Then I get conflicting reports for two weeks, and finally they say it's screen is broken, which it had no breaks or situations to even be damaged... They voided my warranty, and then tried to smooth things over by offering me a refurbished version of the same TV, for the same price you can get it anywhere now.

I will be having my third mainboard installed by sharp again under warranty next week.  Even when the set is fixed, I know it is just a matter of time before the mainboard fails and the TV cannot accept HDMI inputs.

I originally wanted the 80\" Sharp but couldn't justify spending twice as much for 10 additional inches (the 70 is plenty big).  The one concern was the inconsistent reviews of this TV.  One major concern in the reviews was a complaint about motion blur during sports.  After alot of research, I've come to the conclusion that most people are having this due to either not having the settings on the TV correct, or having one of the lesser cable providers.  We have Verizon Fios and cannot be happier with the TV's picture and performance (I've also heard the same from people with U-Verse and Direct TV) but bad comments from some people with cable providers that really compress their feed. Also, don't worry about comments about crummy speakers.  These are typical TV speakers and are fine for most of us that don't want to turn on our surround sound to watch everyday TV.  I currently have the sound on 7 (not sure how high it goes up to but 7 is very very low on the scale) and I can hear dialog just fine across the room 20 feet away.Anyway, this TV is the best.

I had a limited budget, I wanted to stay as close to $1000 as possible.  I can't use a plasma due to the lighting in my living room so I had to get an LED.  All the reviews I read pointed to this TV as a decent deal for the price.  Is it the best 60-inch out there?  No.  But it's a very good TV if you find it around $1000.I didn't buy this from Amazon, price too high.  I found it at my neighborhood Walmart on sale for $998 (regularly $1498) during Black Friday weekend.  I took it home and set it up.  First thing I did was install the new firmware.  Sharp's web site has, at the time of this review, firmware dated 11/1/12 [...].  Many of the poor reviews here might have their issues resolved by this updated firmware.  I connected the TV to my network via its ethernet port and the TV updated itself.  The update process only took a few seconds.As others here have said, the default colors are bad.  You really need to tweak the picture.  Fortunately, there are quite a few web sites that list good settings (CNet, TweakTV, AVSForum).  I tried each recommended setting and settled on the one that looked the best to me and my family.  I used 'user1' setting and made all my changes there.  I didn't change any of the stock settings (Movie, Standard, Dynamic, etc).  I also left the 120-motion setting to 'high' because we mostly watch sports.I was coming from a 46-inch Sony, so the experience of viewing a 60-inch screen was a bit shocking at first.  But I got used to it!  The quality of the picture is largely determined by what your cable/dish/antenna is sending to it.  As you can imagine, a screen this big will take small imperfections and put them right in your face.  I'm using a Dish Network VIP722 that outputs 1080i.  My picture quality is pretty good on most stations.  You can really see a difference in the HD vs non-HD channels.  Non-HD is not unwatchable, it's just that you really notice a difference.As a bonus, the set is DLNA-compatible so it can see my home NAS (with all my pictures and movies).  On the down side, my movies are all in mkv format and this TV can't read mkv via DLNA.  It can read mkv via USB so if you have a portable hard drive with movies in mkv you should be good.  I can view my jpg images and listen to my mp3 songs without a problem.  The mkv limitation doesn't bother me because I have a Roku and blu-ray player that both read mkv videos.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.  You can spend more money and get a better TV, but I didn't want to.  I set my expectations ahead of time, knowing I would get a slightly above average picture and feature set.

This TV's is large, aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Has 4 HDMI ports which I LOVE, however the reason this is getting 3 stars is because of one huge flaw and I know this is not a defect because there are too many reviews I have seen between this site and the LE600U (non smart version same size)... The dubbing is off by about .25 seconds. I normally wouldn't have noticed this but since I had read the review I started to look for it and it's REALLY in my face. I mean it's not like it's a huge difference but I can see it and I find myself focusing on it and it is really hard to watch shows with a lot of lip movement because I find myself checking the voice to visual match up and it drives my absolutely insane. Had this been a different situation and I had a way to return to the TV and have the same mix up in my favor I would choosea  different TV. On another note, the color, brightness and contrast settings are definitely there and you DO have to tweak them because this TV looks terrible out of the box. Also, I have found that the FILM MODE which runs the movies/ picture at 24FPS is really hard to tolerate especially with anything animated. My cable input for example even with FILM MODE turned off and motion assist turned off it still to some degree does it when the PS3 and XBOX with the setting off are fine. The auto brightness of the TV is a nice feature and only turn it on at night because its quicker to push one button once then hold down the turn brightness down button. All in all with the TV set up and picture settings adjusted the picture does look great with the exception of the lag in the dubbing. The sound I will admit does suck. But it doesn't sound horrible like most people say about this TV. Don't expect Bose quality speakers on a tv. Doesn't happen. They do the trick.

I bought it because in the store, the picture looked as good as anything else, and it was the cheapest namebrand 60 inch set with smart apps.  After a couple months with the set, I can see that you pretty much get what you pay for.  First, I can say that if you aren't picky, and you aren't expecting much from the web apps, you will enjoy a decent 60 inch picture and better-than-expected sound. The devil is in the details with this set.The first thing you realize about the web apps on this set is that the built-in web browser has been deliberately crippled; probably to preserve the price points above for other sets. You get just the few apps that Sharp wants to give you, and they don't always match the ones on the box. There's a Netflix button on the remote which would be great, except about every other time we want to watch Netflix, the set has forgotten our ID and password, so that information has to be scroll-entered on an on-screen keyboard - hardly convenient. [UPDATE 9/22/12 - The Netflix forgetfulness problem has either been eliminated or diminished, perhaps by an automatic software update, who knows. I'm giving a 4th star, but I think that might be a little generous.] We have much better web apps in our 3-year-old $99 Roku player, and somewhat better apps in our $69.00 Samsung Blu-Ray player. [UPDATE 12/4/2012, after another update, we can access more apps in a \"sub-app\" called Vudu apps.  Now you can access NBC Nightly News, Rachel Maddow and more.] Supposedly there is a way to jailbreak or hack the browser to allow the addition of other channels, but I haven't followed through with any of the weblinks.  Do so at your own risk. I think I'll just get another Roku player.I must be more of a videophile than I thought, because I am slightly disappointed with the picture in this set.

The best way to explain it is a subtle softening and sharpening of details that makes even filmed content looked like it was shot on a soap opera soundstage. I'm told that this is a byproduct of processing normal 60Hz broadcast  content to a 120Hz or 240Hz refresh rate. With most sets, you can fiddle with the controls and either eliminate or greatly minimize SOE. I haven't found the magic combination yet with this set. I've only watched a couple Blu-Ray discs on this set, but I haven't been bothered by SOE on the discs I've watched. I usually watch Blu-Rays on our Epson 8350 projector in the basement (see my review Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 8350.) By the way the Epson projector does not exhibit SOE even with broadcast TV. If you have a light-controlled room, and you like a big screen experience, you should really consider getting a projector.UPDATE 12-4-12. After about six months of ownership, and learning through trial and error how to minimize SOE, I can tell you that the only thing that bothers me about  this set is that it is slow to respond to channel change signals.  Sharp has been diligent in issuing firmware updates.  As others have reported, this set has been sometimes on sale for $999 for short periods, and these sales are likely to become more frequent as \"next year's model\" isn't far away.  The bottom line is that if you can get this television for a grand - give or take, it's an excellent deal, and you are unlikely to do substantially better for at least a few months.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good while it lasted", "Author": "robk64", "ReviewID": "RJZI7LVQ5Y9I2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The thing I liked about this TV was the anti-glare coating that it's replacement lacks.  The size and weight were good, and configuration was straightforward.  The problem my TV encountered after only 8 months of wallmounted use was light bleed-through on the bottom of the screen.  It would appear the screws/bolts that held the back to the front may have been screwed in too tight at a few places along the bottom of the TV.  Eventually, this may have caused the strange phenomena to occur.  Coincident with the screw/bolt locations, on lighter image content, an area the size and shape of a small flame would extend upward from the edge of the screen, and be much brighter than the surrounding content.  In dark image screen content, this did not occur.  Only light screen content.I had purchased an extended warranty, but as this was still within the first year of ownership, Sharp replaced the unit (after several emails, a phone call, and about 15 photos of the problem) with a newer version.Unfortunately, the newer version has a more reflective screen, and if my eyes aren't playing tricks on me, the top of the screen is warped or curved.  Convex.  Maybe that's how you can get 179 degrees viewing angle.  No idea, but for now, it works.Almost no point in writing a review, as this particular model has been discontinued.

This is especially important in winter where LCD panel can freeze and crack during shipping. I turned the TV on and the screen came on with Sharp setup menu.  So, I signed my delivery papers and started to mount the TV on the wall.  At 86lb, this TV was light and easy to handle with my wife. I could probably handle this alone, but didn't want to risk anything.  The back of the screen for the mounting holes are flat, so you won't need any spacers for the bolts.  In other words, you could mount this flat against the wall.After the TV was mounted and my AV all configured, I turned the TV on.  Everything was fantastic until I selected the NetFlix app.  While the Sharp setup menu is all based on black background, the NetFlix app starts with a red and white background which highlighted a problem with my TV.  The right-bottom LED was dead.  It was about 10\"x10\" area of significantly darker picture.  I could still see the pixels being lit, but the LED was clearly dead causing that area to be dim.I contacted \"Sharp Aquos Advantage\" service and a live person answered immediately, listened to my problem, and did some troubleshooting right on the spot to restore the TV to factory setting in the service menu. When that failed, I was instructed to submit the receipt with photos of the TV highlighting the problem.  I was also to submit the serial # and that's when I was like - the TV is mounted and it's a hassle to look behind the TV - an to my amazement, Sharp put the serial # and barcode on the right side of the TV.  Very convenient.After a few weeks, the TV was determined that it needed to be replaced. I was then given an option to take one of the refurbished models.  Normally, I would have been upset but took the deal since they upgraded me to a much higher model LC70LE874U which is 3D capable unlike the LC640U.Sharp delivered the replacement via white-glove service who came with two people to remount the TV as well as pack and take the broken unit.The replacement TV works flawlessly.  While it took almost 3 weeks for the whole process, I am satisfied with how Aquos Advantage Program handled my service call.** For those of you buying new Sharp Aquos TV, Sharp has better extended warranty service plan than SquareTrade (unless you're buying from Costco).  After registering your TV on Sharp website, you will be given an option to purchase Sharp Extended service at a significant discount.  I would strongly recommend the Sharp OEM warranty based on my \"upgrade\" experience.--- LC70LE640U vs. LC70LE847U ---After having had the LC70LE847U, I can tell you that the 3D functionality is nothing to write home about.  I've spent several hundred dollars buying the Sharp 3D glasses and spent some time watching 3D content, but I would've been just as happy with the LC70LE640U.Also, I experienced audio sync delay issue on my Onkyo receiver, but that was due to \"delay\" timer setting on my Onkyo.

Setting it up was a snap, the HDMI Audio Return Channel works great with my Denon 1913 receiver, so I only need the one cable to send sound from cable TV or the TV's apps through my HT speakers.Picture quality out of the box was impressive, but like everyone seems to complain about with LCD screens, there was the dreaded Soap Opera Effect.  This is trivial to get rid of: hit Menu and turn off Film Mode.  There, done, no more SOE.  I also applied CNET's settings to the Cinema mode, which is good for watching movies at night.  For regular TV or watching during the day, I use the Standard settings.  Picture is crisp, colors pop, there is no ghosting or other artifacts from good HD sources.Gaming seems to work well on this TV, I have my XBox 360 hooked up to the second HDMI input and I don't notice any lag when playing shooters.  The TV has a \"gaming\" picture mode that minimizes picture processing to reduce lag.  As long as your game console can output a signal at the TV's native resolution (1080p, or 1920x1080) like the 360 can, and the TV is in this mode, response time is excellent.My only major complaint picture wise is with the uniformity of the backlight.  There is an area about 1/4 of the way from the left side of the screen that is noticeably brighter when the screen is dark and the backlight is on -- it is visible when switching inputs for example.  I never notice it during movies, though, so it's not really a major issue.  This type of thing is pretty much unavoidable with edge-lit TVs so I will live with it.The apps on this set are fine as far as it goes, they provide a functional, if fairly basic, interface to Netflix etc.  The real problem there is the wifi range; my wifi router is a couple of rooms away from this TV, and the TV only gets one bar of signal.  But, I have three other wifi devices in the same room as the TV, all of which get four bars.  I wound up having to use a wired connection in order to make Netflix actually usable.  YMMV on this one, but it could be an issue if you really rely on the TV's internet access.Overall, I am happy with this TV; despite a couple of flaws it is a good deal.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV - Home Theater Experience", "Author": "Katzohki", "ReviewID": "R28G3EIVS1HDQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is truly awesome. The color and picture is spot-on, especially if you have a 1080p video to watch (like a BluRay). Some BluRays look better than others, I think that is just a difference in the way the movies were filmed. Paired with a good surround sound system, you can totally get a home theater experience. It saves us money from not having to pay 20$ at the theater. Colors are good, blacks are black. Sharpness is perfect.The speakers aren't the best, but certainly good enough to watch TV at a loud volume. For movies I would recommend a good surround system, but that really goes for ANY TV. The dynamic color mode (usually what you will see most TVs set to in the store) is a bit ridiculous, as the color saturation is way too high, but it does make the colors pop (too damn much). We watch with the TV in Standard mode 90% of the time.For games you must set the AV mode to \"Game\" as that will clear up the lag problems you might get without it. Even Mario Bros is difficult to play without being set to Game mode.

There are a few buttons that seem to be accessible only by remote control - I may need to spend a bit more time with it.Cons:# Internal speakers sound is one of the worst I heard, just like coming from a tin can.# This seems to be a design issue, as default factory settings for treble/bass are such that they attenuate the effect to a certain extent, however nothing acceptable when one pays $800+tax for it. I am using a set of computer speakers with it and sounds infinitely better.# when on internal speakers there is no sound volume change above setting level 30 of 100. On external speakers the signal keeps increasing till about 70~80%.# when playing media from network (DLNA or youtube) - Menu key is not working as usual and cannot get access to settings of image (like sharpness) or sound (like tone); one has to change source back to one if HDMI/TV inputs, make any required changes, then return to the network source and search again for the media that was playing.# once getting used to youtube on a PC or tablet, one has a hard time using it on the TV (maybe after a while...)# even though Internet is mentioned in the user manual or some reviews, there is no internet other than these 4 apps that the TV comes preloaded with.# when playing things from local media streaming (DLNA), if there are a lot of files (music or videos, or pictures) it will take forever to start playing. One better choice is to look for the media by the folder or whichever way it allows groups of max 10~20~30 files.# Pictures will not play from DLNA server till all pictures in the group have built the thumbnails - it is a slow process.# For playing DVDs it is better to have one of the new Blueray players with good upscaling features; I tried one LG520 (very good at its time), however cannot watch anything due to upscaling artifacts; I had better luck with a 30$ Curtis DVD player (smoother image).# Youtube low res videos look rather bad (especially when watching from 6ft); could not figure out how to play them in a smaller window# had some MP4 (720p or 1080p) downloaded from Youtube that would not play over DLNA saying that it does not have a compatible codec.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Truth", "Author": "Antonio Fong", "ReviewID": "R1K6MKPMUV2PDN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "LC-60LE640U Sharp Aquos 60 Comes ready to use, when you have all your mount, connection ready.

I wouldn't sit any closer than say 9 feet.  Not a knock on this TV, but, some of the sorry compressed programming out there will look bad up close.

Anyway, save yourself a lot of trouble and use this setting, it will auto configure everything for any lighting and the type of show.  Just give it 10 seconds for it to figure out the room lighting (it will look dark at first). When watching high speed sports sometimes I notice a touch of artifacting only for a second when a ball outruns the motion on the TV.  This not a bother to me.  You can adjust it out but you have turn off a few things and you can't run it in \"auto\" picture mode.  Moving on, Blue Ray looks ridiculous on this set!  And, I love the auto sync the TV recognizes my Samsung home theatre in a box system (I can run the basic functions of my home theatre system from the TV remote and it auto powers up the system so they both come on together).  I like pressing the Netflix button and movies are quick to access.  The only thing is if you are not tech savvy, it may take you a while to figure all out.  And, be sure to use good HDMI cables for all.  I had to call Sharp once and they were very helpful and in the States!  They couldn't fix a Netflix issue.  The picture in 1080p and 1080i is amazing!  720p is excellent, but wish all programming were 1080i or p.  Its flat out more data per frame.  This is a great tv for the money.

But my husband insisted that we didn't need to waste another $1000. He came there to buy the Vizio but soon realized that on the display tv it had a delay in the sound as some people had complained about. So he kept looking until he decided on this one. It was easy to put on the wall and he basically did it himself besides me holding one end to attach to the wall. Once on. The picture is amazing! It looks like 3d without actually having 3d. The quality seems great. Its definiltey going to take some getting used to if your just used to the normal HD. I feel like I'm watching a soap opera now. I have had no problems with Netflix yet as some of complained about.  We did realize that our reciever does not pick up the netflix sound. We have to turn off the reciever and listen to it through the tv. Now I'm sure there is some savvy people out there that knows exactly why (I was told it had to do with our receiver being an OUT and not transmitting sound BACK to the receiver from the TV  but i have NO idea what I'm talking about). So far we love our tv and will update this more as we continue to use it.  UPDATE: I haven't looked to see if others have complained about this or not. But the \"Smart\" feature on this TV does not work great. Netflix runs slower on our tv than ANY device in our house. We don't have to re enter our password every time like i have seen some people have to do. But ours takes forever to connect to Netflix. Once it connects, it won't play all the shows we want. It always says to try again later. But after trying a few times (that takes about 5-10min) our show plays.

Picture is clear and sharp.  And way brighter than I need.But the built in sound is atrocious, so plan on having an external audio system if you decide to buy this unit.  There are 4 HDMI inputs and one component AV input (Plus PC and USB)  The only audio outputs are either the coaxial digital (SPDIF) or the headphone jack on the side of the unit meant to drive an 8 ohm load, i.e., there are no analog audio outputs for a stereo unless you don't mind using the tiny headphone jack and adapter cables.The power wire is hardwired to the TV, i.e., there's no IEC connector if you want to use your own external cable. So you have to use what they give you for the power cord.The power button and input selector buttons on the TV are on the right side and behind the set so you have to feel for them (and remember what they are by feel) if you have anything on the right side that blocks the even limited view of them.Although the remote has programmable buttons for favorite channels you can't program them to select the HDMI inputs, so to change inputs you have to go through the 'input' button on the remote and scroll through the choices.  The inputs can't be renamed, i.e., I'd love to name one input \"Roku\" and the other \"Blue Ray\" but it won't let you do that.  So you have to remember which is which.There are no instructions for mounting the unit to a wall mount, so I used the M6 metric tapped holes on the back.

There is some adjustment time needed to get good picture quality but I would say average amount of adjustments needed.  Built in speakers are mediocre and somewhat tinny, overall OK but nothing special.The problem with this set and what makes it unacceptable is the motion artifacts.  Anything with motion is essentially distorted, the more the motion, the more the distortion.  A football kickoff has the football looking like a pixelated blur, the football is nothing more than a broken set of brown pixels traveling across the screen.  It seems to get worse the more the signal is compressed before it gets to you.  However, even a Blu-Ray ends up with artifacts.  It detracts from everything you are watching unless it's a static scene with little motion.

Thanks for the assumption of ignorance on my part, and it's sad to see such assumed negativity from some people (I'm an electrical engineer who worked as a TV repairman, run production for a TV show, etc).  I have been adjusting and calibrating within the limits of the TV.  There has been some improvement, but nothing to justify raising the rating in my opinion.  Yes I am critical of products that do not at least meet the average video performance of what else is out there when they come out of the box, particularly for video equipment.  Those of you who disagree should check the ratings of an independent reviewer such as Consumer Reports if you don't like this one.  In my opinion, when a TV has to be professinally adjusted (added expense for most) just to even approach average performance, that's a large strike against it. Products should be consumer friendly, work well, and be able to be used by most consumers without having to run it through a video studio.

Peterschmidt", "ReviewID": "RL3EU564OMK68", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I usually don't write product reviews, but this one needs to get written.  I bought this TV thinking I would really love it.  In actual fact, it's tolerable.  Barely.  First, what's good about the TV?  Well, the picture quality is as good as most modern HDTVs - that is to say it is very good.  I guess if a TV was going to have one strength, the picture quality is the best area to be strong.  That being said, that's about the end of the good things I can say about this unit.  The bad stuff is bad - very bad.  First let's talk about the remote.  At first glance it looks ok, but after some usage the flaws are evident.  The unit is thicker at the bottom, which helps in getting a firm grip.  Unfortunately, Sharp chose to put the VCR controls for the Smart apps at the very top of the remote where it is thin and hard to hold, particularly given the bottom-heavy weight distribution.  On top of that blunder, they made the app control buttons tiny and difficult to press.  Hey, Sharp.  You went to the trouble to put a huge red \"NetFlix\" button down at the bottom of the remote.  Ever think about putting the control keys (the most commonly used keys for me) near that button?  For some odd reason, Sharp chose to put the TV's menu controls at the bottom, which are some of the least used buttons on the remote.  In spite of that, they get the prime positioning, right in the sweet spot where your thumb falls.  They are easy to operate.  They also have a nice, thoughtful layout.  The much heavier-used smart app controls, however, are small and poor.  What gives, Sharp?  Even worse than the button layout issues, though, there is the remote response issue.  It's bad.  It feels like this TV has a processor out of the 1980s to run the remote and smart apps.  Button response time is about the worst I have seen on any TV, particularly bad when in a smart app.  There are times I would hit the Volume button (or some other button) and have to wait a full five or more seconds for a response.  Ok, it was not that bad very often, but there was always enough lag time to be really annoying.  Hey Sharp, how about putting in a processor strong enough to run this machine?  Most TVs are underpowered when it comes to the CPU, but this is ridiculous.  It's not like you weren't asking for several hundred more dollars for this unit than your competitors were for similar units.Surprisingly, as bad as they are, the remote control issues are not the worst feature of this TV, however.  That honor is reserved for the Netflix app that comes installed.  Wow, is this app bad.  Horribly bad.  Unbelievably bad.  Allow me to describe a TYPICAL experience with this app.  To get at it, you first push the big red \"Netflix\" button on the remote. Having a big button to bring up Netflix was nice, I will admit.  Given that you only hit it once, though, it could've been somewhere other than a prime spot under the thumb.  In any case, once you push that button, the problems begin.  Quite often, after trying and failing to make a wireless connection to the service, I would see a nice gray screen with the words \"Unable to connect to Netflix.  Please try again\".  As often as not, pushing the \"Try Again\" button resulted in yet another request to \"Try again\".  Usually after a few tries, the app would connect and would successfully show the Netflix user interface.  It is a nice, slick user interface.  Select a show and watch the little red progress bar move about a quarter of the way to full, then stop.  This would happen nearly every time.  About 3 minutes later a failure to load the show would be announced, again with a \"Try again\" button.  I soon discovered this button does absolutely nothing.  Instead, one has to hit the Return button, select the show again, then sit for 3 more minutes.  Another failure screen.  Rinse and repeat typically 5-6 times, often more, occasionally less.  If I was lucky I could be watching the show I wanted to see within 15-20 minutes of turning on the TV.  I could usually have watched an entire half hour show in the time it took to get my first show to come in.  There were times when no shows would come in at all in spite of repeated attempts.  In these circumstances, the first thing one would suspect would be the wireless signal, and I did.  Of course, Sharp was unable to provide any kind of network diagnostics on this wonderful TV.  No signal strength readout, no network test, nothing.  The TV was positioned about 3 feet from a PC, which was accessing the net flawlessly via wireless connection at the EXACT same time all these connection problems would be happening on the TV.  Further, I tried to test the net connection by putting my Roku right at the base of the TV.  It, too, was able to work flawlessly while the TV was flailing away helplessly.  Further, I could move my smartphone around the area of the TV and show full wireless signal strength.  I concluded the network does not appear to be the problem.  I finally broke down and bought a new Roku 3 to use with this TV.  That has solved the issue entirely, since the presence of the Roku has eliminated the need to use the TV's remote, as well as the need to use the smart apps.  The only part of the TV I actually still use is the picture display.  I couldn't be happier to be rid of the need to use the rest of this poor excuse for a TV.  It's so nice to finally have a Netflix app that actually brings in a show the FIRST time I push the button to select it.  Sharp, you suck.
