Quite happy with all features.--Playing all videos using internal TV player (mkv, avi, mpg, VOB). Able to connect DLNA through WiFi in a second using special DLNA server software for Win7 (NERO software recommended by LG is sucks... Windows Media Player is worse...), was able to play VOB without fragments (DVD format). Wifi working in N mode with 40Mhz width which is pretty enough to play 1080p mkv 3D from my PC.--Not so many good apps on LG market. Youtube app is cutting my videos on sides. With the latest FW update, youtube through Internet browser in this TV working as a magic. Do not need to enter activation code each time (as in youtube app). It has cookies, so there is no needs to enter login info each time. The browser is slow, but it is enough for watching movies.--Magic remote is very useful. Some people do not like it, but this is a personal choice.--Goodbuy cable TV. Digital HD antenna + internal browser with flash + Netflix is pretty enough.--The quality of 3D is outstanding. No flickering, no shadows, just superb picture. 2D is excellent too. It has resolution upscale - low resolution video doesn't have cubes.--Cool design - slim.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but a lousy \"smart tv\"", "Author": "Cory Haflett", "ReviewID": "R2K0SEL3R9DJ9P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from a wholesale store about 1 year ago. I have it hooked to my computer and has worked well for that. The 3D is passive, and the quality is good.The color in the top left corner has started to bleed quite a bit, and it seems to be getting worse, black shows up as a dull orb of color. What really gets me angry with this TV is that it likes to do things on its own. I will be right in the middle of watching something (over the HDMI input) , and all of the sudden this ridiculous \"smart TV\" decides to start loading a you tube video on its own. Its always the same one, at a piercingly loud volume. This issue persisted even after the latest firmware update.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Depends on what you\u2019re going to use it for.", "Author": "J. C.

After three days of use, the \u201cSmart TV\u201d\u00a0features are already excruciating.\u2022 The YouTube app only works on about half the videos.\u2022\u00a0The Netflix app forgets our password, at least once per day.\u2022 The TV itself forgets our network, at least once per day.\u2022 The web browser is so insanely slow, it can take several minutes for a page to display.\u2022 When attempting to play Internet videos on CBS, USANetwork, or Hulu, the videos can take up to 20 minutes to load\u2014and that\u2019s just for the first act. Each time there\u2019s a commercial break, it takes several minutes for the next act to load. (And no, this isn\u2019t due to my Internet speed. Videos come up near-instantly on any of our computers, and LG tech support has confirmed that a 15-20\u2013minute wait is \u201cnormal\u201d for their TVs.)In short, when it comes to Internet-based videos, this TV is absolutely *horrible*.Now, that being said, it does work well for other things: OTA channels are sharp and beautiful. Netflix works perfectly. While Pandora is not included, we have it on our Roku and it sounds wonderful, much better than I would have expected from a TV\u2019s internal speakers. Ultimately, it\u2019s just the internet apps that stink to high Heaven\u2014a rather glaring oversight for what claims to be a \u201cSmart\u201d\u00a0TV.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really great TV", "Author": "Carlos G.", "ReviewID": "R1TURYYZL733AG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best TV I ever have.The picture quality is amazing and the sound is pretty good.The apps are fine (should have more) and work great.The 3D function is incredible.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "not worth the money", "Author": "MLA", "ReviewID": "R29TUZ3WYEUHTL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought this the other day from a store and I will probably return it.
