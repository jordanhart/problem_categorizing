{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Television for a Very Reasonable Price", "Author": "J. Brogden \"SoulBoy\"", "ReviewID": "RKNF85TRQO2PG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this televion once my old standard definition CRT television died right in time for the digital transition. After doing some comparison shopping I happened upon this TV and chose it to replace my old 19\" CRT. The first thing you'll notice about this television is its relative weightlessness, while common for flat screens is a nice change from cumbersome CRT's. Also setup is very easy and once hooked up to an HD digital cable box through one of the two HDMI ports the picture quality difference is immediate.Initially the television was connected to my HD cable box via the coaxial port on the back of the TV. Surmised from many a HDTV review I expected standard definition shows to look worse once connected via HDMI but I guess going from coaxial (the bottom of the barrel) to HDMI (top of the line) provides an increase rather then decline, even in the visual integrity of standard definition shows and HD shows are on whole new level. Vibrant colors, nice crisp images and great line quality are the qualities sorely lacking from standard definition programing and televisions. Also I had no problems with the viewing angle what so ever. If I had to down this television for anything, it would be that the audio quality is lacking (an apparent hallmark of smaller flat screens) but i'd recomend an external speaker setup to remedy this. Besides that small nitpick this set has my stamp of approval.If you're searching for an HD-TV television that provides great value without sacrificing quality i'd fully recomend this set.", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "And so my TV hunt ends", "Author": "Brian C \"Bobazonski\"", "ReviewID": "R2RAG0FS9X5FX8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a small TV to put in my bedroom and to double as a computer monitor. I put this in my Amazon cart when it was only $200, but it went up to $250, so I kept looking. Then I missed the Gold Box Deal of a Panasonic Viera 26\" for only $250. (VERY disappointed) Later at Wal-Mart I stumbled upon this one again for $248 and decided to buy it and finally end my hunt. I'm a pretty generous rater on Amazon, but if I wasn't I'd probably give it a 3-star.What I like:- Works great as a computer monitor and automatically adjusts to the differing aspect ratio of my computer games- Two HDMI ports is nice for a small TV (I don't use them yet but I'm sure I will in the future)- Buttons are located on the side of the front panel within easy reach--you don't have to wrap your hand around.- Inputs and outputs located in the side are pretty deep--enough that the cords are easily concealedWhat I dislike:- The VIZIO logo glows white when on and can't be turned off (though it's pretty dim, not distracting), worse yet it glows orange when the TV's off. IT'S A TV, NOT A MICROWAVE. That can't be turned off either.- There is no letterbox zoom. So if you're wantching a widescreen program on a standard definition connection, the picture is stretched horizontally AND has horizontal bars.- Speakers are horrible. I don't care much because I have been plugging speakers in to the headphone jack.- No RCA audio out. You have to use the headphone and get a 3.5mm to RCA if you have a stereo or something similar. There is however an optical out for a home theater.- Remote is kind of cheap looking and is not universal (but this isn't expected on a small set).- Only one composite video--I know it's outdated, but it's still pretty common.- The only reason it's called an ECO TV is because it exceeds Energy Star guidelines by 15%. Woohoo. Big deal. For all I know, all LCD TVs do. I thought maybe it was made from recycled material or maybe NOT IN CHINA.

Since we already own other Vizio equipment that we are quite happy with, we decided on this model.  It has a good assortment of inputs:  2 HDMI, VGA, Component, Composite, SVideo, and coax.  We've found the picture quality from both our HD cable box and our Blu-Ray player to be very nice via HDMI.  We haven't experienced any viewing angle issues.  SD signals are generally good as well.  There is some fuzziness, but that's normal when viewing SD content on an HD set.  Most of the time it's barely noticable.  The sound, however, is not as good.  It sounds a bit hollow and tinny, no matter how we adjust the bass and treble.  I think our old RCA actually had better sound, and that's the only thing that stops me from being able to give the Vizio 5 stars.In short, if you can get around the slightly dissappointing sound, the VA220E is a very good choice if you're looking for a smaller HD set with a lower price tag and an excellent picture.", "Date": "December 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice little TV - Vizio quality!", "Author": "rjv", "ReviewID": "R22OPKEMDC8S62", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for my 13 year old after repainting his room and kicking out his younger brother. The picture is clear and very vibrant. Side and angle viewing is also good. The audio has an SRS surround mode which sounds great at higher levels. At low levels it can be a bit empty with little bass but if you turn it up great spatial sound comes through. Remember, when you are looking at these TV's at your local WalMart what you are seeing is a direct feed digital signal, DO NOT expect this kind of quality unless you have high def reception or are watching a DVD. Also, depending on how your cable provider sends it's signal you may still see black bars on the top and bottom of the pictue. I spoke with Vizio Support about this and they were very helpful and explained. To be honest, my old 19inch CRT still has a bigger and better picture for normal television viewing!", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Value", "Author": "J.

Sound is not as good as my 42\" panasonic but its a fraction of the cost and size, its good for what it is.  Much more viewable picture size than a 19\" would be in the office where I have it.

DVD's look solid and I'm not using HDMI.  Plan on adding blu-ray and will consider Vizio in the mix when I do.  Only viewing angle problems experienced when looking up from floor.  From the bed or a chair no problems at all.  Sound is a little lacking but fine for the bedroom. An outstanding buy for the money.  Found my set at Walmart and the price has dropped since purchase. Amazon pricing is pretty close.  Recommend where HD is desired, but you don't have the room for a 37\" or 42\".", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "D. Krysl \"Cinephile\"", "ReviewID": "R2WKVFKEDWQ2A0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first bedroom TV, previously all I'd watched was an older Tube TV. I was a little hesitant to buy Vizio at first because I hadn't heard about it before. I bought new and all my fears are allayed. I haven't had any technical problems at all. Simplest setup in the world, you just put on the stand, connect a few cables, and you're good to go.Even though this TV is only 720p, Blu-ray still looks incredibly crisp and it's an obvious upgrade from DVD. Many people told me I wouldn't see the difference on a small screen like this, but if your vision is good enough (mine's about average), you will. The black levels are pretty good, you might want to turn on the Black Level Extender in any case. A few people complained about the remote, but I really like it, it's got an ergonomic shape and fits nicely in your hand. In the back there is a headphone jack, but because of the way the TV is molded, my Sennheiser plug doesn't fit. That bothered me, but I found a way around it by just connecting straight to the BD player.I can't say much for the sound because I have my Logitech speakers hooked up from my Blu-ray. I'd imagine not many people are going to be using the default speakers, anyway.The only thing I wish it had is more options for aspect ratio. I believe anamorphic widescreen is not one of the options, I had to set that up on my BD player.Overall: highly recommended! This TV is a joy to use and a great bargain.

The sound quality is good, it actually seems loud based on the volume number that is displayed on the screen.  The resolution is good the only problem I have is the color.  It seems that you work on the color on one channel and get it dialed in how you like and then when you change the channel the new channel's color is off.  Needless to say I have dialed down the color which ultimatley makes the picture quality not as sharp as it should be.  This is a TV that we only watch about an hour a day of programming so I was not too upset with the color options.

I chose this 22 inch Vizio. It was either this or an RCA. I have an RCA tube tv and have always been impressed with the life span of that tv, considering I've had it since 2001 and it still works jsut like the day I bought it. I liked the picture quality in store on the Vizio over the RCA and liked the fact that it has 2 HDMI ports over the RCAs 1. I took a chance and boubght the Vizio, brought it home, plugged it in, scanned for over-the-air channels, and the moment I seen CBS in High def, my jaw dropped. The picture quality is cleaner and crisper than anything I've ever seen before, and the sound is just as good! I have an Xbox 360, and composite cables so I dont get the full High def experience, but it looks amazing just through those cables. Lucky for me, I just recieved my HDMI cables I bought for like 3 bucks here on AMazon, and get to see what its like later :). I definately recommend this tv to anyone who's doubting Vizios quality or lcd line.

The sound was so poor that I hooked up computer speakers to it, which helped.  The picture was acceptable, but not great.  All went well for 8 months and then one day it would not turn on.  I called Vizio and after testing, they told me I had to fax a receipt to them and then they would tell me how to SEND the tv back to them for repair.  I asked if I could take it to our local dependable repair facility, and they said \"No.\".  I called the facility and they said they do not work on Vizio.  So then, I had to decide whether to spend the money for fax, box and padding and shipping costs and then worry that it could be smashed in shipment.  And I would have to wait at least 3-4 weeks for return.  I went back to the store to see if they would ship it back, and they would if it were under a 90 days purchase.  They also said that people returned Vizio TVs more than any other brand.  Many of them stopped turning on, so I think Vizio has a defective part in them.  I do not recommend Vizio (lost about $300 with it) and now have purchased a SONY, which cost the same as the Vizio for the same size TV.
