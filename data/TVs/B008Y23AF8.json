No \"Bells and Whistles\" or extra features. But, if you need a T.V. in an extra room for the kids or guests, this one does the job at a very attractive price. I will confess, I purchased the extended warrantee \"Just-In-Case.\" Since the price of this LED was so reasonable it was worth the extra expense to have that peace of mind.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "love my new 32in TV", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R14SZDBMDULV3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love my new westinghouse TV, its great product was shipped quickly and I recommend buying Westinghouse product to anyone.

I just got tired of looking at the 19\" screen on my Mitsubishi 26 year old set which still works perfectly. WalMart had a presidents day sale,so I picked up this set for($200.00).Watched a few video reviews on Utube and the reviews were pretty good. My daughter has a 40\" lcd set and my mother has a 26\" Westinghouse for about 2 years now. Neither on has had any problems with their sets. Even though I have only had this set a short time the picture is very good and the audio is acceptable. Set up was easy and I have a Dish Hopper and a Bluray player hooked up. The Blu ray display is excellent. Of course if you do not have Hi Def in your home the picture will not display well. Some of my cable channels are not hi Def or if you watch old tv series the definition isn't as good.  One tip I picked up on reading other reviews is that when you initially set up you new tv there is a display mode. If you set the picture up in Retail mode or display mode the picture is brighter, a better display. In conclusion I am very happy with this set. Great price,great performance.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst Customer Response Company on the Planet", "Author": "Yankee Gindoff \"Yankeeg\"", "ReviewID": "RTHLCIAXCBSLL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I own this model.
