{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent TV....almost perfect.", "Author": "GJZ", "ReviewID": "R3VLG0GNHWDBX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV to replace a 42\" LG in my master bedroom (which replaced a 40\" Sony XBR6).  (FWIW, both of those TVs were purchased from Amazon.  I have purchased six 40-47\" TVs from Amazon and have never had any shipping problems or damage.) I originally started with the 42\" version of this TV which was returned to Amazon due to some screen uniformity issues (more later).  Due to the LA6200's thin bezel, the 47\" worked in my space.  I've had it for 4 weeks and I'm quite pleased with it overall.  If I could give half stars, I would award it 4.5.  I can't and on balance I thought it was more fair to give it 5 than 4.APPEARANCE:This is an impressively styled display.  The dark gunmetal bezel is quite attractive.  I was glad to see LG left off the silver accents that are creeping into more of their models.  I view those as unnecessary styling elements that detract somewhat from the overall appearance of the set.  LG designers did a great job on the LA6200.Several have commented this TV is much thicker than some of the very thin models on the market.  That is necessitated by the back lighting system LG utilized on this model line.  All LED TVs have LCD panels.  LCD panels, unlike plasma displays, are incapable of generating their own light...they must be back lit to produce a visible picture.  The very thin TVs are edge lit.  The LEDs are placed on the left and right or top and bottom of the panels and mirrors reflect the light onto the panels illuminating it to provide a picture.  This configuration allows for a very thin TV, but there are compromises.  The primary concern is called flashlighting.  If there was a scene with a bright moon against a dark sky, the LEDs on the edge of the panel would have to light up the moon.  As the light is being reflected, some displays will show a beam of light, not unlike the pattern of a beam of light from a flashlight, going from the edge to the illuminated object...in this case the moon.The LG LA 6200 series are direct lit meaning the LED lights are arranged along the entire back of the panel and not just the edges.  A full array back lit set has a great number of these LEDs mounted relatively close to the screen.  Full array sets are found in the upper tier models and tend to be quite expensive.  The direct lit system LG used utilizes less LEDs.  To properly illuminate the panel, they are positioned farther away from the panel resulting in that thickness. Direct lit sets don't have problems with flashlighting, but they can have issues with dark screen uniformity and light bleed.  Both my 42\" and 47\" LA6200s had/have light bleeding...the 47 far less than the 42.  This is why I would deduct 1/2 star, if possible.  The issue actually seems to be getting a bit better as the TV breaks in and I'm only seeing it on some dark screens, not all.SET-UP:The TV was very easy to set up.  Mine is mounted to a stand (VESA, M6 bolts) so I did not use the included base, but that looks very simple to attach.  After you turn on the TV, you go through a brief set up...home or store use, zip code, time zone, etc. and then to Picture Wizard II.  This is a calibration tool LG includes to help you adjust the TV for home viewing.  After going through it's procedure and then later using the Disney Wow Blu-ray calibration disc, I was impressed how close to that mark the Picture Wizard II settings were.You definitely want to do this.  TVs are set up in stores to be as bright as possible as studies have shown in a big box store setting customers are drawn to the brightest displays and perceive those to have the best picture.  In a home setting, especially with controlled lighting, those store settings will look horrible.LG has already released a firmware update for 6200 series, so you'll want to update the software through the TV's menu system.REMOTE:The 42 and 47 come with ONLY the standard remote.  It is well laid out, but unfortunately not back lighted.  The correct Magic Remote is the AN MR400.  It is fully functional with the 47, including voice functions, and makes it far easier to access the TV's smart functions.  It is well worth purchasing in my opinion.SMART FEATURES:Relax, Amazon Instant is on the way.  LG has been rolling out updated firmware in waves to provide this app.  They started with 2011 models and have finished both 2011 and 2012 models.  They are now working on updates for 2013 models, so it shouldn't be much longer.The only app I use now is Netflix....streams without buffering or other problems  (Verizon FiOS - hardwired.)The LA6200 has full internet capability.  It's workable with the Magic Remote, but I don't use this very often....not far enough along the learning curve, perhaps.PICTURE QUALITY:Other than the light bleed issue, it's very difficult to find any fault in the picture quality.  Whether watching Blu-ray, DVD, Verizon FiOS or streaming Netflix, I have been extremely pleased, especially after I calibrated the set.  Excellent clarity, accurate colors, realistic flesh tones and no perceived motion issues (even with Trumotion off as I hate the Soap Opera Effect).3D:I'm not a huge fan of 3D, but I did want the capability for occasional use.  LG's passive 3D is excellent, probably the best in the industry (it should be, LG invented it and licenses it to other companies).  More manufacturers are dropping active in favor of passive (Sony, for example) with Samsung being one of the few major active holdouts.  There is a very interesting article on Displaymate's website (they sell calibration software) where they came to the conclusion that passive technology actually offers a better, clearer and sharper 3D image.  The active supporters like to claim that passive 3D offers only half the resolution of active sets.  While true in theory and if you sit abnormally close to the screen, due to a phenomenon known as \"image fusion\", the human brain perceives the passive display to have equal resolution at normal viewing distances.If you purchase this set, spring for Avatar and The Hobbit on 3D Blu-ray and really appreciate the 3D picture this panel is capable of producing.AUDIO.The audio on the 47\" is surprisingly pretty good.  I suppose one benefit to the thicker frame of this TV is the ability to use larger speakers.  I have a Zvox 220 in this room and haven't even bothered to hook it up yet.GAMINGI don't play games or own a gaming console so I can't speak to that.MY SETTINGS: (Note:  This TV is in my bedroom which has total light control.  I have electric hurricane shutters on every window/sliding glass door.  These settings will result in a dark picture in an environment with more light.)Energy Savings:  OffPicture Mode:  isf Expert 1Backlight:  40Contrast:  90Brightness:  57H Sharpness: 2V Sharpness: 2Color:  57Tint:  G9EXPERT CONTROL:Dynamic Contrast:  OffSuper Resolution:  OffColor Gamut:  BT709Edge Enhancer:  OffColor Filter:  OffGamma:  2.2PICTURE OPTIONSNoise Reduction: OffMPEG Noise Reduction:  OffBlack Level:  LowReal Cinema:  OnTruMotion:  Off (Note:  Turn this off if you dislike soap opera effect)Nitpicks and Quirks:1.  Standard remote is not back lighted.2.  Screen uniformity issue described above.3.  When streaming with one of the applications such as Netflix, the Settings button on the remote (lower left) does nothing.  If, however, you press the sleep timer button (lower right), you can not only set the timer, but select video, audio, size, etc.  I found this a bit odd.4.  To get to the menu to turn off Trumotion while watching an app such as Netflix, you need to press the \"My Apps\" button on the remote to get into the menu AND you have to adjust the picture separately for EACH app.5.On the standard remote the Smart activation button is extremely close to the up button.  You need to pay close attention to their proximity when you are entering your account info for Netflix and the like or you'll kick yourself out and have to start over again.  (I did this several times...yet another reason to buy the Magic Remote.)6. The power cord is a bit short.  If you search Amazon for a \"Mickey Mouse power cord\" (I am NOT kidding) you can find longer ones for a few dollars.7.  This is 60Hz refresh rate panel.  LG, along with many manufacturers (Sony, Vizio, etc.), fudge on this number.  \"TruMotion 120\" is a 60Hz panel that provides an EFFECTIVE refresh rate of 120Hz through a processor producing frame interpolation. This is where the infamous \"Soap Opera Effect\" comes from.On balance, I think this TV is an excellent buy for the money.  If the panel uniformity issues could be resolved, it would be a solid 5 star TV.Please feel free to post any questions and I'll do my best to answer them.7/10/13 UPDATE:Someone on AVS forum with actual calibration equipment calibrated a 47LA6200 at a B&M; store.  While my limited settings were obtained using the Disney Wow Blu-ray disc in a very light controlled bedroom, the settings below were obtained in a very brightly florescent lit store environment.  His settings are far more extensive, including color management and 20 point grayscale settings.  These will probably result in a picture a bit too bright for most home settings (f so, start with lowering the backlight level).  By the way, this person indicated after calibration, the 47LA6200's colors were extremely accurate.  He also thought black-level and contrast were a bit weak.  Color management and 20 point grayscale adjustments are performed in the expert menu.

Storoy \"Hans\"", "ReviewID": "R2VBQN768ICC70", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV (the 47\") to replace an older LG 42\" LCD that I broke. I was looking to stay with LG since my last TV was great, and I preferred the passive 3D just because I don't want to pay an $50-$90 for a technology that will be lightly used at most. The 2D to 3D up-convert is just a bonus that makes it more usable.Pros and Cons below, but one feature I was not prepared for that has been great, LG Cloud. Its a free 5Gb video, 2GB photo service. I can upload videos (including xvid) from my computer or phone and play via the cloud on my TV. Absolutely love that.Pros- Fantastic picture quality. Great blacks, very smooth.- TruMotion, when used for stuff like sports and other high motion video (this is also a con, see below)- Passive 3D with 2D to 3D makes this usable right out of the box.- LG Cloud- Huge collection of Smart TV Apps (Please add Amazon Instant)- Price. I called and got the price dropped $120 to match BestBuy. Well worth it when you pay no shipping or tax (Prime)Cons- No Amazon Instant (at least not on the 47\")- No Magic Remote, which was in the description, but not with the 47\" at least.- TruMotion was on by default. It makes regular TV look kind of like a Soap Opera, that kind of cheesy looking filming, can't think of a better way to explain it. I turned it off.- Picasa App doesn't seem to work, every time I click on an album the app closes.Overall, the cons are about what I thought was included based on the description and 1 setting very easily turned off. The TV is a great, inexpensive Smart/3D TV. Nothing really I can complain about. Glad I stuck with LG.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value TV with a few flaws", "Author": "Mathieu J. Champagne", "ReviewID": "R3MSGT3RGK7EBW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wasn't in the market for a new TV until the neighboring row home suffered a large fire, causing extreme smoke damage to our apartment.  Thankfully our apartment is livable again, but we were forced to throw out and replace lots of items, especially electronics.  My previous TV was a 42\" LG LCD, which I had purchased about two years ago.  I had used it in collaboration with an LG Smart BluRay player and a regular old antenna to accommodate my cable / dish free lifestyle.  When it was time to replace the old smoke damaged goods, I knew what brand I wanted to go with.I did a boatload of research before making this purchase, and contemplated other brands as well.  My checklist of \"needs\" included:-LED-45\" or larger-Smart TV (Wifi included with Netflix, etc...)-Streaming compatibility from my Apple computerThat's really it.  Doesn't seem like too all of an order, but finding information on Smart TV's and their ability to interact with Apple Computers can be a pain; this includes LG TV's.  The only reason I had hopes that this TV would work with my iMac upstairs was that my previous LG BluRay player did.  I took the leap and purchased this TV in the 47\" version,and so far I have been extremely happy.My setup is insanely simple.  The TV is hooked to power, and I have a very small antenna hooked into the TV and hidden.  With this setup, I am able to view almost everything I need.  I connect over wifi to my iMac upstairs and stream downloaded content, stream Netflix, and watch broadcast channels.  I also have an HDMI to MiniDisplayport cable just in case I need to hook my laptop up.  Setting the TV up was a breeze, although it would have been easier with the Magic Remote (which, as mentioned by other reviewers, did not come with this TV).  If you have an iPhone or apple device, you can download the LG TV Remote app to control the TV in a similar fashion.  I find this much easier for signing into things since it has a keyboard and behaves like a mouse pointer.  I was worried about not being able to stream large files over the wifi network, as this was the case with my old streaming device, but this TV handles it like a champ.  LG uses Plex media server to stream content from computers and devices, and setup was very easy.  It also is very good at handling large files and buffering them correctly to prevent them from stuttering.  I have successfully streamed 12GB 1080p 3D BluRay quality files from the computer upstairs without an issue.  The other basic apps all work as they should, but are still a little clunky.I followed come color setup techniques from a similar TV on CNET.com, and after doing so the picture looks amazing.  I'm sure the casual person won't have any issue with the standard presets, but being a designer by profession I appreciate a correctly calibrated monitor.  The 3D seems great so far, although I can't seem to dial it in 100%...always gives me a slight headache.  The TV itself is decent to look at, easy to put together, and fits the aesthetics of my modern style.The few complaints that I have are to be taken as very, very minor.  The first thing that I noticed is that this TV is much more reflective than my previous one.  It's not so bad that lights reflect in it easily, but you get the glaring, rainbow colored X's that cover most of the screen.  I definitely have to be more concerned with the lights when watching this TV.  Also, the sound quality of the built in speakers is good, but not great.  My LG TV from a few years ago had richer, deeper sound than this TV; it's definitely more tinny.  The Smart TV features are somewhat convoluted and somewhat difficult to customize.  My girlfriend opened the menu and said, \"what is all this stuff...were never going to use it\", and for the most part she is right.  It would be nice to customize all of your menus to feature ONLY what you use.  You can rearrange some things to be easily accessible, but there are some items you can't remove.I definitely recommend this TV, as it is an excellent value for the price.  The Smart TV apps work as needed, and help to eliminate the need for cable or satellite.  Be aware of the reflectivity of the screen, and the fact that this does NOT come with a Magic Remote.  The TV works great for streaming from computers and devices with Plex media server.  The picture quality is fantastic, and with some color calibration is excellent.EDIT (06.17.13):  After flipping channels and landing on a hockey game, something caught my attention.  When the camera pans over large bodies of solid color, like the white ice rink during hockey, there appears to be a blotchy appearance to the screen.  Upon researching this, I discovered that it has a name; DSE (Dirty Screen Effect).  Before jumping on Amazon and requesting an exchange or refund, I really looked into this issue and discovered that it is incredibly common.  I found a forum where one person exchanged their LA6200 model TV twice and they both had the issue in varying levels.  It appears as though there is a coating on the screen, perhaps AR (anti-reflective), that gives the appearance of dirty smudges.  It's not always immediately apparent to people at first, but I can usually get them to pick up on it after describing it.  It drives me nuts.  Unfortunately it sounds like most newer TVs have this issue, and it is just something I am going to have to live with.  I just wanted to give a heads up to buyers and potential buyers about this issue.Edit (07.08.13):  The DSE (Dirty Screen Effect) is starting to bother me so much that I am contemplating beginning the process of having the TV replaced or repaired.  For an idea of what I am talking about, please refer to the two images that I uploaded for this product.  Anytime there is a light solid block of color all I can see is the patchy, blotchy dark areas.  It's such a shame because I love everything about this TV besides this.  I'm super hesitant to deal with LG as the last time I called them they would not repair a TV because I could not find my receipt anywhere (despite the SN indicating that it was still under warranty).  I'm interested to see if anyone else has had any issues with this?Edit (08.24.13): I just wanted to add that I received a firmware update today that added Amazon Prime.  It looks to have added some other features, but I had seen multiple people ask about Prime.Edit (09.17.13): I finally called LG about the DSE (dirty screen effect) I was experiencing and they sent out a contractor to come look at the problem.  Upon viewing the issue, they ordered a replacement display.  After the nightmare that was scheduling appointments and being blown off by the repairmen multiple times, the new display was installed.  To my surprise, as well as the repairmen, they problem was STILL there.  It literally looked exactly the same as the first display.  Now they are going to order another internal part to repair.  I'm not sure how many times they are going to replace parts until they just replace the TV itself, but my guess is many, many times.  You have to really admire a company that isn't willing to exchange a clearly defective product that is less than a few months old and cost almost $900.  I do believe I am done with LG.I Made a video to hopefully show what to look for with the DSE effect.  It is kind of hard to see through a video, but it should help show what I see.  The lighter color bars pan across the screen, and the blotchy dark areas remain still over top of the image.  It is very easy to see during football, hockey, or interior home shots with a panning camera.  [...]Edit (10.15.13):  After the third visit from an LG contracted repairman, the TV is still suffering from the DSE as mentioned above.  This repairman contacted LG upon replacing the power supply which had zero effect on the issue.  LG contacted me by phone and they setup a replacement of the TV.  I didn't think I would ever stick with this for so long, but being persistent pays off.  I don't have my hopes too high, as I assume the new TV will suffer the same issue to some extent (god, I hope it does not).  The replacement TV should arrive shortly, and I am to put the old TV in the box and return it with the included return slip.  I will update with new findings after the new TV arrives.  Crossing my fingers.Edit (10.24.13):  The replacement TV is currently at some freight shipping place 30 minutes away, and since they could only schedule a time for delivery between 1-5pm I will be driving to pick it up tomorrow.  I am excited to check it out and report back on my findings with this replacement.  I also wanted to share updated picture calibration settings and review links for this specific TV.Review: [...]Calibration Settings: [...]Edit (11.21.13):  Sorry for the delay in updating this review; I wrote one a while back and just found out that it never posted correctly.  I received the replacement TV and it exhibits the same exact DSE issues as the original.  I can now say, having seen three different displays, that this LG model will ALWAYS have DSE issues.  While the DSE varied slightly among the displays, they all were beyond acceptable.  I cannot endorse this TV, and I have shifted my review to two stars.  Between this issue, the poor customer service I have received with my last two LG TV's, and the newly discovered privacy concerns, I am certain I will avoid this brand from here on.Edit (12.01.13):  Just when I thought my saga with this TV and LG had come to an anticlimactic ending, the replacement TV I received has now begun restarting itself automatically at random times.  The other night while watching regular antenna TV the unit made a loud popping sound and turned off.  When it turned itself back on, the same thing...loud pop followed by a restart.  It did this about four times before I pulled the plug.  Since that day, the TV will do this whenever it pleases...which is super awesome.  I'll keep everyone updated with how this round of repairs goes.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall a Great Television", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R25NTPKKW3E447", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV about a month ago, and have to say I have enjoyed almost everything about this set. Setup was super easy, and within just a couple minutes I was able to access everything, I do have a network hub with my entertainment system though, so that did speed things up. One thing to note that they don't mention anywhere I could find is that the system says that it has both Component and Composite video inputs, which is true, but they use the same ports, so it is not possible to have both plugged in at the same time. This doesn't affect me, but it might affect some of you.I work in film/video, so when I got around to calibrating the image I was more than pleased. In the Cinema mode you have the ability to adjust every minute setting to make the picture as crisp and accurate as you could imagine. Which makes movies look like incredible, with minimal to no distortion in the blacks or highlights. If that is something that you don't want to worry about most of the default settings looked pretty good straight out of the box, but even a complete novice can make there TV look 10x better just by running AVSHD. This guide is a great intro if that is something you want to do.[...]The smart features of this TV are nice, but since I have a number of other devices hooked up to the set I don't really use any of them except for when I first got the set. It does have some apps that I could see being useful to exploit the 3D capabilities of the set, like a 3D movie rental front built in. During my initial tests of those I did find it extremely easy to navigate and adjust the home screen to a layout that is unique to what you want. Many of the built in apps are usable, but simple in comparison to their companion apps on the PS3 or Xbox. I would probably compare most of them to a Roku app, so still very usable, and capable of doing basically everything you want. Typing using the standard remote is painfully slow though, making searching a burden.The 3D is actually pretty good, but goes wonky at about a 30-45 degree off angle, so for 3D viewing a deeper room is better than a wide room. I was skeptical of the of the 2D->3D conversion built into, but after using it for a couple of things it does a surprisingly good job, but you won't see the effect on everything. It was really nice when I loaded up a 3D clip from YouTube. By default it displayed it in Side-by-side, but when I pressed the 3D button on the remote it detected the form of 3D and worked flawlessly. While both of those features are a little gimmicky my 3D blu-rays look spectacular on this set, and in some cases the 3D is even more discernable than when I saw the same film in 3D in the theaters.Another side note on the 3D, this unit does use passive 3D which means that you don't have to buy glasses from LG if you want more than the 4 pairs provided. Just start collecting them from the theater when you go, and they work just as well. LG's glasses are lighter and easier to wear, but they wear a little funny when you wear glasses as well. It's not unbearable, but I find the ones from the theater a little more comfortable, at least for me.One of the things that I am not excited about with this set is that when you want to switch which input you are using it brings up a full screen selector. It does show you what is coming in on that connection if you leave the selector on the input for a couple of seconds which is nice, but if I just want to switch back and forth quickly between inputs I cannot do that. That same selector has the audio selector if you want an HDMI return channel, or are piping audio out through S/PDIF. To avoid most of the switching issue I have everything going through a receiver, but even then the TV will occasionally get a signal crossed or something and I will get duplicate sound through the TV speakers. It is easy enough to put back, but still the occasional annoyance.The only other problem I have with the set, which probably won't be an issue for most people, is that through my receiver I have one device CEC enabled, so I can control it with the TV remote. On my old television it would pass the commands through the receiver no problem, but with this unit I had to do a couple weird things with SimpLink (LG's CEC protocol) and adjust some settings on my receiver. It was after I turned SimpLink on that I started having some of the weird issues with the TV changing the receivers audio settings mentioned above. The problems aren't a deal breaker, but they do get slightly annoying sometimes, especially when anyone else has it happen while using it since they don't know how to fix it.Overall, this TV has been a great purchase. I looks great as a whole, and produces an excellent image. It is a little more expensive, but you are paying for a reputable brand, LED, and 3D. When you combine it all together it makes a great television, and one that I would recommend to anyone looking to buy a 3D TV, or someone looking for a high quality image at an easily accessible price point.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "UNBELIEVABLE PICTURE!", "Author": "J-Mo Chicago", "ReviewID": "R3573Y2G2A94IC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this thing almost 2 mos now and I gotta say I LOVE IT! I'm a hard core AV Fanatic so I was very discriminating on which set to buy. I did extensive research on several 3D sets for the last 2 years and decide on the LG 55LA6200 AND got a steal of a deal for it. When I first brought it home the picture seemed mediocre but after spending a few hours tweaking the picture settings  - I'M BLOWN AWAY!  I have to say: I love the soap opera effect! It creates a ultra vibrant, very rich, very deep colors. I tell ya: movies I've seen many times before (Matrix, Gladiator, Miami Vice) are new again!  Watched the Dark Knight blue ray last night and was blown away. With the right settings - It makes even regular DVD's look like Blue Ray. The 3D effect is OUTSTANDING! Paired with the LG BP325W and Panasonic DMP BD210 ( for Cinavia free movie watching) 3D blue ray players, the 3D effect is just amazing. Clash/ Wrath of The Titans in 3D - awesome! The best 3D movie so far - AVATAR - It's unbelievable. Also DREDD 3D - you have to see to believe - the slow-mo 3D is really trippy. I've rented almost every 3D movie from Family Video's collection and the 3D novelty just doesn't get old. With 3D viewing, It's not so much watching TV as it is \"looking into it.\" The 3D effect displays a foreground, middle and background to the picture - it's truly dimensional. A new way of viewing your fave movie and games.Gaming in 3D --SWEEEET! Have my 360 and PS3 connected to her. The PS3 plays 3D games: Mortal Kombat, God Of War (Origins Collection: Chains of Sparta/ Ghost of Sparta), Resistence 3, Killzone 3 - amazing. 3D gaming - who woulda thought...??? I bought the special gaming glasses (AG-F310DP) that separate split screens so each player has a separate view and played MW3,  Rainbow Six Vegas, and Need For Speed Most Wanted (2006) and can report - the glasses work great!Can't say much about the tv speakers - Since bringing her home, she's been connected to my Pioneer 1122 receiver set up as 6.1 (4 Wharfedale towers, 2 JBL Venue Centers(F+R), JBL Venue Sub) and have never used the TV speakers -- 60% the movie experience is the sound! Gotta love DTS HD Master Audio and Dolby Tru HD.The networking connection was a breeze! Picked up my home wireless network automatically. Typed in the network key and voila! Connected to the internet. Had to update the firmware and then off to the races. Netflix rocks!Everything about this set is fantastic. I love movies and gaming and this LG just beautifies the ENTIRE experience. For the price, hard to beat. I prefer and LOVE the passive 3D feature over the costlier active shutter 3D. There's some very minor ghosting and blurring on high speed shots but very negligible. I've also notice the Dirty Screen Effect I've read in other reviews but only in certain scenes in certain movies. Too minor to even mention. This TV rocks.

I returned the Samsung and Purchased the LG 42LA6200 hoping for the best. I had the TV for about 3 days when I started to notice \"Flickering\" on some channels and not others. After doing some basic troubleshooting, I decided to exchange the TV for the same model hoping that it was just a fluke of bad luck. When I returned home with the replacement, I hooked everything up and watched closely to see if the same issue would start happening again. Low and behold, the same thing started happening again. This led me to start thinking that it may be my other equipment and not the TV itself. Here is where the fun begins. I tried different hdmi 1.4 cables, every setting possible on both the cable box and the TV, component cables, different cable boxes, moving the TV to different rooms, different inputs on the TV, and at one point even adding a signal amplifier to the cable box. It still was happening. None of my other TVS in the house do this and they range from Samsung to Olevia and everything in between. The flickering would only happen on some channels and only at scene changes of the show that was on. Commercials on the same channel were not a problem. My Blu-ray player also plays FLAWLESSLY even in 3D mode, so it is the broadcast and not the equipment. Through some extensive online research, I found out that the problem is with the firmware of the tv itself. What was happening is known in the industry as \"GOP\". It is when a broadcast station alternates its transmission between 1080i@50fps and 1080p@25fps at scene changes. The Tv does not notice it and render it fast enough for the eye to avoid seeing it (GOP). All of the other major brands have had issues with this since the broadcasting started in Feb of 2011 and have corrected it through a firmware update rather promptly.It is a shame that I'm caught between a rock and a hard place because this may well be the best LED TV that I have ever seen before in this size range. I don't want to get beyond the point of not being able to return it to the store without knowing if there will ever be a firmware update to solve the problem. I would rather not enter the \"Warranty Period\" , because that is a whole issue in itself. Its just like everything that is newly released, you just have to wait it out until the kinks are all taken care of. Most people will not even notice this problem, but it drives me crazy considering the fact that the channels it happens on are my favorite channels to watch (Bravo, Spike, VH1, etc.).The IPS screen in this TV is stunning aside from the 60hz native refresh rate. The sound is Incredible for TV speakers. Viewing angles are awesome for an Led TV. Design is outstanding. And last but not least, the value is great too.I will be returning the TV today and not getting one to replace it just yet. I'm gonna have some patience and wait it out until all of the kinks are fixed, Then I will re-buy it.Sorry if I pointed attention to something that might now get noticed by people that did not see this before they rated the TV.  I still think this TV is awesome, but we buy TVS to Watch TV. That should be the main focus here.Thanks for reading.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 3D TV", "Author": "anna lee", "ReviewID": "R2MM73DVCB89GK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must admit that I was not sold on getting a 3D TV but I am glad I got this one.

I have not encountered any bugs or errors yet.All functions of television work as described. Once you do a pro picture set up, the image is of excellent quality. I am no electronics guru, but I always do my research before buying.This television had the name that I trust, the size I wanted, the features I crave (yeahh... i like 3d, i don't care if it's gimicky and there isn't much content to utilize the feature.  But on those occasional nights I choose to partake in mind altering goodies, the 3D keeps the drool rolling down my chin.)Aside from the hours upon hours of HBOGO, Amazon, and Netflix I watch on this TV- I game as well. Although I am no MLG- I do feel that the refresh keeps me up to par with others.I do enjoy the fact that this TV has regular firmware updates. This to me shows that LG is keeping up with improving the functionality of their products, and while the 14min it cuts out of my entertainment time every once in a while, I take joy in knowing that my TV will work just a little bit better in the end.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Provides a great experience for the money", "Author": "Chicago Book Addict", "ReviewID": "R3NTJ59LYPF84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this TV for a week now and have been really pleased with the quality of the picture, the ease of accessing a range of content, and the overall aesthetics of the TV. While it's too soon to tell on lifespan, I also own a 2012 LG TV that I've been equally pleased with (LG Cinema Screen 47LM7600 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses) and that has continued to perform well over time so I'm confident this TV will do the same.Before you read the rest of the review it's important to note that while I did do a fair amount of research before buying my first LG TV I'm by no means a TV expert so this review comes from the perspective of someone who appreciates a high quality TV viewing experience, but doesn't understand every technical in and out. Consider me your slightly savvy average consumer.  Warning, this review is a tad long since there are so many aspects of owning a TV.  Accordingly, I organized my points into buckets so that hopefully it is easier to skip to the parts that interest you if necessary.Set up:This TV was a breeze to set up.  If you choose to use the stand, it is very easy to put together and attach to the TV.  It took me 10 minutes maximum to assemble, including the time spent hunting around for screws I had accidently dropped on the floor.  Once the stand is set up, I found it quite nice.  It has a sleek minimalist design and rotates about 45 degrees in either direction. As for the TV itself, there are just a few set up screens and then you are in business, though some individual apps also have their own short set up to validate your accounts (i.e. Facebook).  You will also though likely want to calibrate the picture and sound before watching.  I personally liked the results far better when I did this vs. when I used the TV with the preset settings.  Even if you are a relative neophyte like I am, there are a lot of great resources online that can help you do this.  Also, there is thankfully nothing you can do that can't be undone so if you create a setting you don't like it is easy enough to change it.  I also found connecting it to wifi to be very easy.  It found my network right away and accepted my password.Picture quality:Once the TV was properly calibrated I was quite satisfied with the viewing quality I have with this TV.  I thought the detail, vibrancy of the colors, and depth of the black with this TV were great.  I also paid close attention (closer than normal) when watching for flashlighting and bleeding and if any was there my eye isn't savvy enough to detect it.I thought I might have an issue with motion blur or judder since my 2012 TV has TruMotion 240Hz, but the difference was actually a lot more modest than I expected, at least with everyday BluRay movies and HDTV shows.  Personally, I was pleasantly surprised.  At least from my experience it seems like you're always going to get a little bit of both with LED-LCD TVs but this TV seemed to handle both well, even when I was watching for both with a more scrutinizing eye than normal for the purpose of writing this review.  I also thought that the TV did a good job when viewing it from side angles.  I did find that the contrast was a little less pronounced then, but still the viewing quality was pretty good.  The option of energy saving features is also nice though I personally like a brighter TV experience so I generally opt not to use them.Sound:Typically I watch TV with a home theater system so I'm not reliant on the sound quality of the TV.  However the built in speakers work better than I expected and I like that there are different settings for the sound.  I found it sufficient for TV and web video viewing but if you plan to use it for music or movies that have dramatic scores or lots of sound effects you'll probably enjoy this TV more with a home theater system.  I noticed when playing music in particular it was really lacking bass and the percussion in particular sounded really flat.  I'm using this in my bedroom and not as my primary TV I'm okay with using my TV speakers for sound though I may get the Soundbar & Subwoofer at a later date after I have spent more time with this TV.Functionality:One of my favorite things about the TV, beyond the picture quality is how easy it is to access a range of content.  I love being able easily use YouTube, Hulu Plus, Netflix, Pandora, Picasa, and Facebook.  I think it is possible that I could drop my cable subscription and still be quite pleased with how much I'm able to use this TV.  At least at the time of writing this review, Spotify and Amazon Instant Video are absent.  However, Amazon Instant Video was recently added to my 2012 TV so it seems realistic it will be added here soon as well.I also have been pleased with the experience of using these services within the TV.  Among the bunch the only interface I've found that I haven't liked is Facebook.  (It's a very dumbed down version of the Facebook experience and I dislike that when I look at my wall it omits links and pictures from people's posts, which makes for an unsatisfying experience.)  Everything else has been easy to use.  I especially like that YouTube works with my phone (as long as you are using both on the same wifi network) so I can use my phone to control what plays on my TV, including finding videos.  I've been especially pleased with the speed and quality.  When I'm watching YouTube videos, for example, they load quickly and I don't have any problems with buffering.  I do find with all these programs I spend much more time on my butt in front of the TV than I did pre-Smart TV.  Thanks to the addition of a dual core processor, I also find that web browsing is faster than it is with my 2012 TV, though it is still slower than with my MacBook.Remote:My TV did not ship with the Magic Remote and I will admit that having gotten used to it with my 2012 TV, I really missed it.  It does make easy work of navigating through the menus and typing when you're using the Apps.  And at least the 2012 version of the Magic Remote is incredibly intuitive to use if you've ever played around with a Wii.  As a short-term fix, I've been using the iPhone remote app for LG.  It's a tad glitchy as it sometimes tells me that my network single is low even when my phone icons are showing a full wifi signal.  But otherwise I find it a bit more convenient than the standard remote that ships.Aesthetics:The one other thing this TV does not have that my 47LM7600 does is the Cinema Screen design, which makes the TV virtually frameless.  This is one of the things I LOVE about my 47LM7600 because it makes the TV fit in nicely in a well-decorated living room.  Instead this has a beveled edge so it is a little less sleek and modern looking, but nonetheless still looks pretty nice.  The Cinema Screen does come with a higher price tag so I think you have to decide for yourself it if is worth the extra expense.  For me when it came to a living room TV it was, but as this TV is used in my bedroom to me the design is more than sufficient.  The one thing I don't care for on this TV is the power light.  On this TV it is in the middle and much larger than with my 47LM7600 where it is located off on the side and just a very small dot.  With this TV it seems more obtrusive, especially in a bedroom at night.  Thankfully it doesn't give off much light and hasn't kept me from getting to sleep.  (Edited to add:  Thanks to the commenter who noted that you can turn this light off in the settings.  I did and like this TV even better now that I know this is possible.  I'm sure if you were having issues with the TV the power light is helpful to indicate that it isn't a power issue but for day to day use I find it unnecessary.)Overall, I think this is a great TV.  Yes, there are a few things in this review that I call out as being less than optimal but to me they were all small things that didn't greatly diminish my overall viewing/usage experience or that didn't seem fair to expect of a TV at this price point.  If you're put off by the price tag that comes with a lot of the higher end LED TVs I think this offers a lot for the money and gives you a great TV experience at a relatively affordable price.", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!!!! 60inch", "Author": "Mark Cooper II", "ReviewID": "RHFELKRPV27HS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The tv is everything I wanted and more.

No LED TV is perfect in this price range, it is a matter of what you can live with.Light bleeding: I think I managed to see this issue when all lights are off and the brightness is 100% and the screen is blank, but who is going to watch a blank screen?, I do not notice anything when something is on TV.Picture quality: Like most of the reviewers said, I love the picture quality. I like the dedicated AV mode button on the remote, you can switch between game/cinema/current mode just by pressing it. Black level could be better, but already better than several other TVs I checked. You can use this TV in a bright room, it has enough brightness to support. The screen is reflective but when the TV is on, you would not notice it.Sound quality: Better than most of the TVs, even music sounds good. It delivers what a small speaker can do. External speakers are required for a big room and better quality.3D: I have not seen a better 3D picture on any other TV.2D to 3D conversion: The standard settings seems to cause some cross-talk, go to manual settings and set both depth and view-point to the lowest(all the way to the left). Now everything looks very nice!Dirty screen effect: I see it occasionally that too only when I use Antenna signal, I am not sure if it is the antenna signal that causes it OR the TV!Connection to Audio system(Receiver): I use the ARC(audio return control) with HDMI1, it works surprisingly well. The minute I switch on the external system, the TV speaker goes silent and the remote's volume button now controls the receiver,  audio comes back to TV if the external audio system is turned off. I do not think it will work this way if you use the optical cable.Smart TV: This is a good to have for me, not great but it is there when you need it. So far I have used only YouTube and Netflix, I see lags when fast forwarding in YouTube, Netflix works without any lag.Magic remote: I bought the remote, I feel that you need this only if you want to do voice-search(and also to control other devices), it does not add much value and I wish it has a dedicated video input button.

During these rare moments I find myself just turning offthe TV to 'get back to it' more quickly than maybe waiting around for the Internet to\"flow\" again. Sometimes this happens when a YouTube video is slow. Usually it is notthe TV's fault.Did I mention the overpriced specialized LG camera was $99.00...??? -lol.I had to perform three software updates to get the current version. Not bad.You have to create an account on the TV and register it online with LG using the TV,as well as agree to some garbage where they will collect \"some usage data\". I didnotice an option to 'not allow them to send file info & personal info/data' & suchback to their servers. Who knows what really goes on with any Smart TV data.???The overall TV volume is lower than expected.When using the headphone audio out, the internal TV speakers are bypassed and cut off. You can use one or the other, but not both.There are no settings to adjust the video quality when using the YouTube app. It willtry to stream the highest quality, whether or not you want it to. If network is slow,it will look like a bad YT video. -lol.No PC/Computer VGA port.Slight \"soap opera\" effect. (not too bad & common on low/med priced TV's.)Cinema & Game video modes do little to help. It also depends on the movie or file.There is no adjustment to force it into a 60Hz refresh rate mode.Factory Settings Need Changing:There is a review here that gives a detailed list of advanced settings in \"ExpertMode\" (after updating) that is quite remarkable. Half of the settings I have no ideawhat they mean or do, but I followed it through and it looks wonderful!When navigating to the LG Smart Menu, there is an annoying short video that loops over and over until you make a selection, and of course, you can't turn off this annoying feature.It has normal motion & nominal blur, comparable to most 120Hz refresh rate TV's. Notbad, not great.SMART TV Features:Shopping, weather,YouTube, Amazon, Pandora, Skype, Web Browser, Games, etc.The Web Browser works really well.I can get to most places and most video works 98% of the time.Overall after extensive research and hair-pulling... I am happy with this TV.Low energy long lasting LED back-lighting technology uses less electricity, less heat,brighter light and another good thing is this is a rear-lit TV. From my research theyare looked on with more approval than the edge-lit LED TV's.If there are any issues regarding this TV or any Service Problems, hassles, etc., I will be sure to update my review!Thank you for investing a rather sizable chunk of your time.I now return you to your previous life.Hope this helps!", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Died in less than 1 year - Facebook is only hope for service", "Author": "Syracuse Pete", "ReviewID": "R11SVO86HW9HG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We have a new condo and didn't even install for 2 months -so one month of useStarted to randomly go from tv or Netflix to the floating Lg logo. Then it would go to only the lg logo flashing on and then off to a dark screen. The only way to turn off was to unplug it.We loved it for a month and had plans of 2 new 60 inch ones for our new houseRevisiting that. And since it sat in the box while we moved we missed amazon return window. I will update with how good a job LG does on customer serviceTotally bummedUPDATE - Next day - pulling TV off the wall to get the serial number since nothing could be done without that. Fortunately I had it on when taking it down and that showed me the issue.  I bumped the main cable cord coming in and the picture came on.  Finally figured out that the straight in plan with a cable is a bad one.  the cable got messed up so it was intermittent and this made the TV wonky.  I went to home depot and bought a 90 degree turn for the cable (put this in amazon search \"Coaxial Type F Female to Male Right Angle Adapter\") - that was the trick  All working perfectly today - updated my review back to 4 stars.  It might even be 5 but they should make the connections a bit easier not to screw upUpdate 2 -10 months in - completely died,  under warranty.  They are coming to replace a board.  It would randomly go to the floating cube.  Then it started to turn itself on randomly.  Then total fail.  A bit nervous cause I have 4 of these setsUpdate 3 -OK -parts backordered and LG couldn't care less  Basically the message was part won't be here anytime soon - too bad  and there is a service bulletin on the wiring harness.  Run from this TVUpdate 4 - Finally used Facebook to get through to them.  Funny how when things go public they get helpful.  Local guy was great no thanks to LG  All is fine now but it is BS that you have to use facebook to find them.  They have a secret phone number that you can find in posts to other people that have complained.  Call that number - they answer in the wonderful USA and they actually help.

The picture is crystal clear with superior contrast and the 3D feature is awesome.  The 120 Hertz refresh rate is great but since all movies are filmed at 24fps it is, at our current technology, overkill.  However, when using the 3d mode it is necessary to compensate for screen judder. After some experimentation the true motion setting CLEAR, which gives a 33.75hz hortz x 30 vert, is the perfect picture.  The 5 & 6 setting makes the  video look cartoonish and odd.  This is most likely due to the film having been bumped up to 30fps before being put down on blueray.  I have friends that rave about their active 3D system so I was worried at first about noticing a loss of quality due to the passive 3D, but the picture still looked stunning;  watched Disney's Tangled with my kids and they were jumping around trying to catch the flying lanterns.  If you can tell the difference in the resolution from 2D and 3D then you are blessed with superhuman vision.  And the passive 3D glasses I can find in packages of 20 for less than 50 bucks.  Score!  The only real drawback to this TV is that there are so many features that it can take forever to figure out all of the customizations.UPDATE 11/20/13Around three days after I received this item, I started noticing some shadow lines developing on the top center of the screen spreading in a ring like fashion.  The lines caused a dark shadow in white backgrounds and a light shadow in dark backgrounds.  The rings were barely noticeable on a full color moving scene, but the moment there was a scene fade it drew your eye.  It was very distracting.  I notified Amazon about this issue and they shipped me a new TV and picked up the defective one for free.

I knew it would be a good TV since it's a LG and I wanted one with built in WiFi. I had a Westinghouse 46\" 1080 & 120Hz HDTV and it had a very good picture and user friendly settings to set the picture the way I liked it. But it just up and died while watching it a few weeks ago and it was only 18 months old. It was like it was turned off and wouldn't turn back on. So that sent me shopping in the Flat Screen HDTV Jungle again. There's so many of them with so many different features that it's almost impossible to weed out the ones that I didn't want and find the one that fit all my requirements and has everything that I wanted, and for a price that I could handle. This one has everything I wanted except for picture in picture. Or if it has that, I haven't found it yet. And it doesn't come with the Magic Remote. That would have been nice and for what the TV cost it should come with it. But they are an extra $80 to $100 for it. Those are the down side things.On the plus side this TV has the sharpest, clearest picture with the most vivid colors where they are suppose to be and the soft colors with outstanding details too. Watching this TV is actually better than seeing what it shows in real life. As for the 2D to 3D where it can take any 2D movie or program and convert it to 3D is just flat fantastic! It does that so well I cant wait to get some 3D movies to watch on it!As for the WiFi it was very simple to set up. Just entered my security code for my router, went back and pushed the blue button on it, (I forgot to do that the first time I tried setting it up) come back and selected connect to my network and it did the rest. In no time I had access to all of the internet functions that come installed in it. Including the Amazon movies on demand with my Amazon Prime. I've only had it up and running for 5 days so I haven't had time to check out all the apps that came with it. But for it's basic picture with HD Cable and even the non HD channels the picture is just fantastic. I couldn't be more pleased with it, unless it came with the Magic Remote.There's several other HDTV's out there that have the 3D and cost less than this one. But almost all of them are only 60Hz. A friend of mine has a Vizio 42\" HDTV that is 60Hz and there is a BIG difference between the 60Hz and the 120Hz. He helped me set up this LG and when I got the 2D to 3D working and fine tuned to where I liked it he couldn't believe the difference between this one and his Vizio.Overall, there's cheaper 3D HDTV's out there but trust me, spend the extra few bucks and get one of these. It's far better and you will be way more happy with this one than the cheaper brands that are only 60Hz. And this one has such a perfect picture, even doing the 2D to 3D conversion I cant imagine any TV being able to have a better picture. Oh, and the sound is exceptional for just the TV speakers. And the best part about its sound settings is it can enhance the spoken parts and suppress the music and sound effects so that I can finally hear what people are saying! I have bad industrial hearing loss and it's always drove me nuts trying to tell what people are saying in a movie when they have that stupid music and those dumb sound effects going so loud that they drown out everything else. Now I can bring out what is being said and finally hear it!So if you are looking for a great HDTV with 3D & WiFi with internet capability along with several internet apps already installed and want one for a reasonable price, I highly recommend this one. Even if you go to the bigger screen size of this same model I don't think you could do better or beat the price and have all the same functions and quality of picture.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG is Horrible and Won't buy anything from them EVER", "Author": "SAUD", "ReviewID": "RBT3VBOECSCZS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We used this product for only two months until it started to have no pictures at all.

Even though it's not an 'ultra-slim' model, the back is tapered and makes it still appear pretty thin.Pros:-Setup was incredibly simple.-Picture quality is almost perfect (also addressed in cons).-3D is impressive, and much cooler than I expected it to be.-Sound is better than the reviews on here led me to believe.  Not sure if it has to do with mounting the TV vs. placing it on a stand, but mine is sitting on a stand about 10\" from the wall.  While I agree that it doesn't produce sound system-quality audio (does any LED TV do this?), this TV is far better than the one it's replacing.-Smart features are pretty sweet.  I didn't even realize that this could play and stream most video files, so I'm able to watch all of the content saved on my PC with minimal effort.-Lots of settings that can be changed to get exactly what you want in terms of picture quality.Cons:-Unfortunately, I drew the short straw and ended up with a vertical red line running down my screen.  It's just one of those things that can happen...As always, Amazon was quick to offer up a replacement or return, so I have another on the way.

For the price, this TV is incredible. Set-up was easy and installing the TV stand took 3 minutes. I'll be happy to update my review if enough people are reading and voting on it. I'll run through the main features quickly:Picture Quality - I have zero complaints regarding quality. Watching anything in HD is flawless, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to this. LED is superior to LCD. Great picture settings as well as energy saving settings.120Hz Refresh Rate - I've heard complaints about this not being a \"true\" 120Hz TV (I can't speak to this honestly), but the difference from a 60Hz TV is VERY noticeable and nice to have for gaming and sports. There's a setting so you can slow down the smoothness (I have mine at a 4) and to me it's the perfect setting for movies and TV shows without giving it an \"unnatural\" feel (or soap opera effect as it's referred to).3D - I honestly wasn't looking for a TV for the 3D function, but for the extra $60 over the non 3D version I didn't mind. GREAT CHOICE. As much as I didn't care about 3D, it was the first thing I tried. Netflix has about 40 or so 3D options, and the 3 I've watched look really good. I also watched Jurassic Park 3D which was a great conversion of a classic movie. It comes with 4 pairs of glasses so it's a great value.2D to 3D Technology - I haven't thoroughly tested this because I just yesterday figured out you can mess with the depth and point of view settings, but I was watching the World Series game using the 2D to 3D mode and it looked surprisingly good. I figured this feature would be a gimmick, but I'm actually quite impressed. I will try playing GTA V using this feature and update later to see how the gaming looks, as well as movies and TV.Smart TV - Haven't messed with this too much besides using Netflix, Crackle and Amazon Instant, but the dashboard is clean and easy to navigate. Haven't had any issues.Sound - Can't complain about the sound. Plenty of setting for this and it has above average speakers in my opinion.NOW for the complaints.....There is an occasional issue with DSE (Dirty Screen Effect) where the backlighting becomes noticeable. The average person won't even notice, and it only happens when a majority of the screen is the same color (so hockey games especially could be an issue). The only issue I had with this so far was watching a documentary about surfing...the abundance of blue made the DSE pop in.My other complaint is that I have to go into the settings to switch from using the TV speakers to using my soundbar. A small gripe, but annoying none the less.I would give this a 4.5 if I could, but a 5 is more fair than a 4 in this case.Thanks for reading..... feel free to comment or ask questions.**Update (11/2/13)**2D to 3D Technology***Gaming*** - I invested some time playing two different PS3 games using the 2D > 3D conversion, and while the games do feel a bit \"deeper\", I don't know that it really adds anything to the game.  I felt it made my eyes tired quicker than if I was watching an actual 3D movie.  I don't think I would ever use this feature for gaming.***Movies/TV*** - I tested several movies and TV shows to get a good feel for the 2D > 3D conversion, and I personally love using this with movies.  I tried with Lord of the Rings and Samsara, and in my opinion they both looked and felt better using the 3D conversion.  I honestly think I will use this feature for every HD movie I watch.  I don't believe it adds much value for non-HD movies though.  TV looked OK, but I don't think I would use this feature for TV shows.*My Settings - I have both 3D settings all the way down to get the best 3D picture, but this is due to my viewing distance being pretty short.120Hz Issue - There is an Info button on the remote that gives you the status of whatever you're watching (tells you the resolution and refresh rate), and no matter what I watched or what settings I chose I could never get it to say anything other than 60Hz.  I even watched a movie in 1080p on a device that is capable of 120Hz and it still said 60Hz.  I can only assume that LG's \"TruMotion 120Hz\" technology is not a \"true\" 120Hz experience.  BUT, my friend has a true 120Hz Samsung TV and I can't tell the difference at all between the two.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Keeps turning on and off.", "Author": "rick \"rick\"", "ReviewID": "R2GLEOSHBKD2KG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Watched it one week and it started turning on and off.

I do not normally right reviews, but this tv deserves it.Pros:-The screen is absolutely beautiful. My Fiance recently commented when she came to visit that, while watching True Blood, the tv allowed her to see all the imperfections on Anna Paquin's face and realize that all the actors just look like regular people with a ton of makeup caked on(so this TV can even boost your own self esteem!)-The sound is definitely above average (as other reviews mention) as far as tv set speakers go. This is more important for the smaller sizes (mine is 47\"), as they are generally in bedrooms and an external sound bar or equivalent device doesn't make as much sense as a large, living room located set.-The smart features- which I had expected to work, but not well- have blown my expectations out of the water. Streaming the different apps and even just youtube via the browser works FLAWLESSLY (and that's with a pretty weak signal where it is located in my room)-The settings are easy to manage. I used some calibration settings I found online and within 20 minutes or so I had a custom setting I could turn on for movies that really takes the color to a new level. Most of the time it is in the 'game' setting, which seems to boost the brightness and the response time a tad as advertised.-The 3D works, sometimes surprisingly well. The difference between this and the LA5700 is mainly the additional 3D features, and at the time of purchases I thought hey might as well get the 3D it's pretty cool. To this day I have used the 3D precisely 5 times (one of which was when I first got it to celebratorally view 'The Great Gatsby', was pretty strange), but nevertheless I love the option to use it when I want to and also....-The build quality improvements of this model over those under it are fantastic. Obviously how the bezel/stand look are low priorities for a tv, but it's nice that this set looks smart and boasts serious quality.-Price! I bought this tv for 713$ if I recall, which I thought was a steal and worth every penny. HOWEVER I have seen this model go as low as 600$! (unbelievable value!). If you're not in a hurry to order this beauty, keep an eye out for another very possible mega-deal. Amazon never ceases to amaze.Cons:-Not free-Heavy? Is this a con? Not really, I carried this bad boy around with ease and set it up (twice) completely solo without any issue- any grown man should be fine. But sweet old ladies who want their mind's blown by incredible picture quality might need a helping hand. I imagine some of the REALLY thin tvs might cut some pounds on the LA6200 which is why I mention this.-Doesn't say 'I love you too' back to me. Its heart is stone.I can't think of anything else to add to this review, but I cannot stress enough how fond I am of this tv.

The tv arrived well re-packed, with all hardware, power cable, documents, controller with batteries, and four 3-D glasses. The set up was straight forward, requiring only a Phillips screwdriver.This LG tv established a wifi connection, and offered to download updated software with a minimum of fuss. The update required about 20 minutes to finish. The Smart TV interface is a bit slow and cumbersome to negotiate, but is well laid out, and should become easier to use with practice. I've heard that there is a high-end controller available from LG that can simplify navigating this tv by using a pointing interface, like a Wii remote. I plan to look into getting one of those.I was delighted with how effortlessly the software found and enabled streaming from 3 different video/music servers I use on my home network. Additionally, I'm expecting to be able to stream directly from my Android tablet and phone, but haven't tried that yet. I was watching Netflix content two minutes after rebooting the set, after the update, and was streaming video from my DLNA server just as fast as that. It is a VERY smart tv.I had a bit of trouble getting my speaker bar working, but that was my own fault: Mostly, I was misconfiguring the speaker bar, but it's worth reporting that it took using the PCM external speaker setting in the tv to finally make sound work.The tv's internal speakers are not adequate, of course, but not bad as those things go. With a Vizio external speaker bar w/sub-woofer, the audio really hits you in the face, and distant thunder on the tv will rattle your windows.The CNET reviews of this LG set are tepid:  they have reported that the video lacks contrast, with inadequate \"blacks\" compared to other sets in the same price range.  At first, I was thinking they were making a good point, but after tweaking the video settings to increase brightness, sharpness, and contrast, along with disabling the power-saving video setting, I went back to Netflix and re-launched 'Sherlock Holmes'.  I'm happy to report that this put a much clearer sparkle into Benedict Cumberbatch's eyes, and put a nice satin black finish on his Florsheim shoes.CNET was also much less than complimentary about the 3-D images on this set. I can't dispute that, having only seen the 3-D picture this set has to offer, but it wasn't displeasing to me. I pulled up some Netflix 3D offerings and watch for a while. The effects weren't as impressive as seeing 'Avatar' at the movies, but it was acceptable and satisfying to me, and for as little as I expect to use that feature (3D viewing makes my wife headachey), it was just fine. I'm glad to have it, just as it is.Although I ordered a tv paying the 'Like New' price, it arrived with a blemish; a deep scrape on the base frame, that didn't really show that much. The set was otherwise fine, and very pleasing for the price paid, but it bothered me that I'd paid an extra $35 over the price for a 'Very Good' set. Amazon support was wonderful: and offered to refund the difference as a purchase credit with Amazon, and they were awfully nice about it, too!All in all, buying this set from Amazon Warehouse Deals was win-win all the way for us.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Improvement Over Last Year's Model", "Author": "Heath", "ReviewID": "RATPAJSD9A7X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought the 42LM6200 last year and it experienced water damage.

You generally only see it when the TV is off, e.g. If you're taking a picture with the TV in the background. If you want a matte finish, buy a higher-end plasma. Maybe the OLEDs or UHDTVs won't have the issue either. Again, it's not an issue unless the TV is off, and the ability to show clear TV in a brightly lit room overrules that issue.On the Outside: The 42LA6200 has the same form factor as the LM. This TV came with a normal remote vs. the Magic Remote. The Magic Remote is like a Wii remote, and it's a love-hate concept. Apparently, enough people gave negative feedback to where you have to buy the MR separately now. And you can download an iPad/iPhone app that lets you control the TV better anyway. It would have been nice to keep the cinema style finish to the TV but the bezel is so thin it doesn't seem to make much difference to me.3D is a nice effect, and it's great having cheap glasses to watch it with. However, that's a gimmick still in my mind, and it's nice to have (bought a 3D Blu-Ray of the Avengers, and that was cool).EDIT Jan 2014: the LA series doesn't have the low-profile bezel of the LMs. But it's really not that much of a tradeoff. From that perspective, the stands on the LMs were cooler too :-)On the inside: The dual core processor makes a nice difference. I liked the LM but it couldn't keep up with very dynamic, busy scenes, with pixelation and blockiness during those times. The LA picture seems to suffer from less pixelation/judder, and I'm much more picky about it now that I know to look for it. I've tried it with NBA games and it looked great, curious to see how it handles college and pro football.So I don't know if the dual core processor makes a difference with image rendering, or if LG just improved the panel. But the dual core difference definitely shows up with Smart TV functions. The browser access time is much improved, and all functions seem snappier. The Smart TV LG's Smart TV system doesn't cover Amazon Prime, but does cover Netflix. However, our Sony Blu-Ray does, so we are covered. For more on what Smart TVs cover which streaming services, check out [...]EDIT Jan 2014: The dual core processor makes the proprietary browser (and corresponding smart functions) faster, but it's still proprietary (doesn't render some stuff) and it's decidedly pokey. I use Chrome, Firefox, and IE and this is much slower than IE (the slowest mainstream web browser). I am using the U-Verse wifi connection and have had speed issues with multiple streaming options (Netflix and Amazon Prime), and my provided router is so old it won't handle wireless-n. Might be a speed issue, I get plenty of signal with all my other devices (3 laptops, 2 iPads, 3 iPhones, Kindle Fire). I'm thinking of trying a powerline adapter to see if I get better results.I have seen some small juddering issues with very busy, complex moving images. But it's better with the LA than the LM, and infrequent. I haven't seen any issues with my Blu Rays and DVDs, so maybe there's a processing latency issue with the U-Verse hardware. I'm glad to hear that Amazon Prime is/will be added to the functionality.After most of the college and NFL seasons have passed, I am happy to say I hardly noticed any motion issues.The TV doesn't have the dynamic contrast and ability to show shades of black/grey like a plasma. But it works fine for me. I also tend to like the \"soap opera\" effect and keep it on most of the time.EDIT Jan 2014: I downgraded this TV from 5 to 4 stars because of the contrast and ability to handle shades of gray. The TV handles color perfectly and shows it vividly. However, when things get dark, you see outlines and only black, it really can't handle anything in between. I am using the stock settings but this was a liability listed on multiple technical reviews, that my own experience backs up. I'm in hotels 2-4 nights a week so I have an opportunity to see numerous other TV models and manufacturers. It's not just my imagination.This TV has multiple ways to share content (MiraCast, WiDi, SmartShare). I like being able to \"throw\" YouTube content directly from the iPad to the TV. I haven't tried the LG Cloud yet but that has to be pretty straightforward. Want to figure out what I can do with the NFC capability.Sound: The native speakers, like John M. mentioned, are about what to expect from an HDTV - uneven in their ability to handle sound. Like Beats headphones, they seem to handle bass well but mid range stuff like voices more poorly. I don't focus on this because I bought a Samsung sound bar. But the standard speakers will disappoint.I'm sure others will come up with harsher technical criticisms of this TV set. I don't know how well the 47LA6200 would stand up to a Sony Bravia or Samsung 46\" smart TV, but those weren't an option for me. Overall I am satisfied.EDIT Jan 2014: Overall, for what I am willing to pay and what I can fit into my built-in entertainment center, I am satisfied, but not overwhelmed. I would probably have similar results with a 42\" Panasonic or older Sony. The main issue is the ability to transition from color to gray and black, but that's not going to go away.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture, weak sound, bizzare menu structure.", "Author": "Terry", "ReviewID": "R3NUBTON4G1D48", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV replaces my 60 inch Sony SXRD (LCOS) set that developed a sick light engine.  The picture on the LG is very good -- blacks are very black, highlight are very bright.  I wish the surface of the screen weren't so shiny though -- it picks up reflections like a mirror.  I use macros on a universal remote to switch between program sources, so LG's bizarre menu structure is something of an obstacle.  It's obviously tailored to their (optional) wand-type remote.  One of the features of the Sony that I miss is the ability to customize settings to each program source, especially the sound levels.  The built-in speakers are, as expected, too small, so I bought a TOSLINK converter to adapt the optical audio output to my older stereo system.  The trouble with that is that there is no set-up option to apply volume control and muting to that output.  I ended up using the headphone output and just gaining up the stereo.

Abraham", "ReviewID": "RHJDE75HOKXX5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked up this TV locally new-in-box for a great price.In my search to replace a 2006 Sony Bravia KDL-46V2500 that's still working fine, I was looking for: ~55 inches, smart, wired Ethernet, passive 3D, swivel stand, at least 3 HDMI and 2 USB, and a USB video player capable of reading NTFS- or exFAT-formatted HDDs (because FAT32 limits file size to 4GB).  Those requirements eliminated most of the current crop of TVs right off the bat.  I was basically left with this LG or Sony's KDL-55W802A, which happens to use an LG panel.  No other TVs available in the US in January 2014 check all those boxes.  Sharp and Samsung use active 3D.  Vizio, Philips, and Toshiba can only read FAT32 drives.  Panasonic's TC-L55DT60 might have worked (can't find info on HDD formats it supports), but it's discontinued anyway.The picture quality of this LG LED LCD TV is very good, although depending on the content it is sometimes not quite as good as my old Sony CCFL LCD TV.  The Sony is a little brighter and reproduces the colors cyan, teal, and white a little better than the LG.  Whites on the Sony are very white and bright, while whites on the LG are less so.  The Sony also looks about the same regardless of viewing angle, whereas the LG gets slightly more dim when viewed from a wide angle.  The image on the LG can sometimes seem a little soft compared to my Sony.  These image quality differences are relatively minor.  The LG has very good image quality, even if at times it is just a small step down from the Sony that I'm used to.  On the plus side, the TruMotion setting on the LG does reduce judder; my 2006 Sony doesn't have that capability.The sound from the LG is not as full or loud as what I'm used to, but I expected that going in.  There are very few 2013 TVs that compare favorably to a quality 2006 TV when it comes to audio.  They just don't put good speakers in today's thin TVs.  I think it's expected that if someone wants decent audio from a modern TV they'll connect it to an external sound system.  I didn't need external speakers for my Sony, but I will need them for this LG.  Speaking of LG and speakers, they just announced a very cool looking, first-of-its-kind, soundplate-style speaker that doubles as a slot-load 3D Blu-ray player (LAB540W).I like the overall design of the TV and the way it looks when it's off.  I like that it has a setting that allows me to adjust luminance to any value from 50 to 500 nits.  The interface for accessing USB and smart content is easy to use.  Video files on a 2TB USB drive begin playing almost instantly when selected and play without any issues.  I've played a video stored on my Windows 8.1 PC using the TV's DLNA feature and that worked fine as well.  I wish it could play Windows Media Center DVR-MS and WTV files natively without the need for 3rd-party software to handle the transcoding on the PC, but no TV can do that as far as I know.  It's fairly responsive and it doesn't take too long to power on.  I've watched a couple 3D Blu-ray discs on it and they looked great!  The 3D glasses are comfortable.  The remote could be improved a little by moving some buttons and making it backlit.  I don't like the glossy reflective screen, but that's true for all modern TVs except for the few bottom rung sets with matte screens.  I wish I could get a matte screen CCFL LCD with the modern features of an LED LCD, but that doesn't exist.The LA6200 is a really nice TV.  My seven-year-old Sony has a slightly brighter picture for some content, and brighter, whiter whites.  But don't get me wrong, the LG has a very good picture.  If you can find it at the price that I bought it for it's an exceptional value.UPDATE 2/8/14:  With my return window for this TV about to close, I have gotten used to the minor picture differences when compared to the Sony it is replacing.  Compared to the other TVs on the market, the 55LA6200 has a lot of upside to it and only minor drawbacks.  I'm happy with this purchase.

Crystal clear resolution. My first 3-D TV was active 3-D. I specifically chose this unit because it's passive 3-D. With passive 3-D you don't have LED lenses flickering black multiple times a second which relieves the epileptic effect active 3-D TV has. (I soon realized I could only watch about 15 to 30 minutes of TV with active glasses on my old TV) Passive 3-D utilizes a polarized screen which is much more similar to the 3-D you see in the movie theaters today & also uses the same 3-D glasses, so extra glasses are quite cheap.I'm also very happy with the amount of 3-D content that LG has in their App Store. The moonlight series, for instance, is just like the Mind's Eye CGI series except way better and in 3-D.

Tinny sound.  Obviously those who stated the sound was \"excellent\" have never heard a good sounding TV.  On top of that, if you want to plug in speakers you need a speaker system with optical input or order a converter for $25 (but see edit below).  No RCA style output plugs for sound are on this TV.  You CAN output sound out to speakers through the headphone jack but this will disable all sound settings on the TV except volume control.  This is actually your only good option with third party speakers (again, see edit below).Edit on optical converter:  Using an optical converter with your own amp and speakers will disable TV remote volume control and all other LG TV sound functions.  The only way to get those sound functions back is either use on-board speakers or buy an LG speaker system.  This is something you will not know until you try it because it's not in the manual.  So if you have a really nice sound system for your present TV you will have zero control functionality if you pair that speaker system with this TV.  And there is absolutely no way to remedy that unless LG includes that functionality in some future firmware update.2.  Outstanding picture.

When we received the T.V., it looked and worked great but after only 3 months of use the television won't stay on. Not only that, you can't turn it off without pulling out the plug.  After doing some internet research we have found that this is a very common problem with this model and LG won't stand behind their product.  According to everything we have read, the problem is an electrical board problem of which the minimum service call will cost $150.00 or more. Needless to say, we are very disappointed.  LG has just lost another customer.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG 47LA6200 47\"", "Author": "K. B. Paredes \"The Imperator\"", "ReviewID": "R15GXFBLJBD27A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great SMARTV this LG is, indeed! I haven't had much experience with LG televisions in the past, so I was a bit skeptical at first when thinking about ordering one of these. Now that I have it, though, I must say it surpassed my expectations in nearly every aspect.DELIVERY:I ordered this with Amazon Prime's 2-day FREE shipping and it came as quickly as expected. If you're wondering whether this TV comes with \"Enhanced Delivery\" (where someone is sent specifically to help you set it up and check it for any issues), it does not.SET-UP:This part was rather easy and not very time-consuming. I set it up by myself, so it took me about 20 minutes (most of the time used was from having to relocate the fat, heavy tube TV this new one was replacing). If someone is there to help you, it will be much quicker. There aren't that many screws you have to place (just 8 total), and fastening the TV itself onto the stand isn't complicated. The one thing I didn't fully understand is if the TV is supposed to fit on the stand a bit loosely or not. I had to keep twisting the screws on there a few times because whenever I'd move the TV they would feel much too loose. It's still standing just fine right now so I'm guessing it is supposed to be a bit loose. When you turn on the TV for the first time, the on-screen installation process is easy to understand and should not take you very long to finish. If you are connected to the internet on the TV at this point, I suggest you update the TV's firmware to experience all the new features that have been added. I also highly recommend playing around with the graphics, color, and sound settings until you find which mode suits you best. The default settings make the audio sound \"canned\" and the video has that annoying \"soap opera\" look to it.SMART APPS:It comes with about 15 or so apps, all of which require an internet connection and you have to pay for almost all of them. Yes, there is an Amazon Instant Video app as well. You have to update the firmware to get it though. The games and such are a bit meh, but then again I didn't purchase this TV to play them. The main apps I ended up using were Hulu Plus and Netflix. The rest seem unnecessary, unless you're interested in listening to the radio from your TV or watching overpriced films in 3D.INTERNET:Setting up the internet will take you a minute or so at most if you have wifi. After connecting to your wifi, the TV will remember your network until you turn off the TV. If you want to reconnect the internet you have to go to Settings, Network Status and then it'll reconnect on its own after a second. If you disconnect your wifi modem or simply turn it off, you will have to re-connect the TV to it once you turn your wifi back on. I've read some bad reviews on here about how this model is horrid at streaming videos or using the internet browser that comes on it. Honestly, I don't see any issue with the TV's internet speed. It will be a bit slower than on a computer, but there is no buffering and whatnot to deal with.[UPDATE: I'm guessing the TV updated its firmware on its own or something, but now I don't have to reconnect to the internet every time I turn the TV on. When I turn on my TV, it is already connected.]3D:This is one of my favorite features that comes with this LG model. I absolutely love the \"2D to 3D\" mode and tend to use it a lot when playing video games. The 3D mode will probably hurt your eyes a bit the first time you try it, but after an hour or so you will get used to it. You can always adjust the 3D settings as well so that it's not so strong. The 3D on this TV not only makes things pop out of the screen, but also adds a lot of depth, which really makes things look even better. Playing my Xbox 360 on there is always awesome with 3D on. The depth makes things look better and more realistic, as if you were looking out a window and not a flat screen. If you're just going to watch regular television programs though, then I can promise you that you won't be using this much.REMOTE:The TV does NOT come with the magic remote that shows on the product page. It also says on there that it is sold separately, so despite the fact you'll see it on the box, you won't be finding one in there. The remote the TV comes with is very standard and long. Comfortable enough, I guess. You will need to purchase the magic remote if you want to fully enjoy the smart features. If you don't want to spend another $80-100, you could always download the LG TV app onto your smartphone as well. It pretty much has the same things the magic remote does, except for the voice/motion control. The mouse on the app makes browsing much easier.Overall, for the price I paid this TV has exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great SMARTV for an affordable price. Remember that if you find the TV being sold for much less at another retailer, you can always call Amazon Customer Service and tell them to match the price on here with the cheaper one being sold elsewhere.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceeded Expectations", "Author": "Sergej", "ReviewID": "R19ITTNUCQ2CUR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll keep this review short, the picture quality is great, can be more or less compared to the high end 3 thousand dollar and over TVs. The design is simple, and right on point, the LG no bezel cinema screen design in it's higher end models is of-course much more pleasant, but is also much more expensive than this TV, which is not really worth it in my opinion. The 3D is great, and overall the experience with this TV has been nothing but amazing. The only downfall that I feel I must mention is that I'm one of the unlucky ones who after a 1-2 month period of use, got 1 stuck or dead pixel in upper right corner of the screen, which isn't really so much of a focus point when watching the TV, but the fact that it's there is quite upsetting. From my understanding this is quite common in LED/LCD TVs to happen, and this defect sometimes goes away with time, or is fixable with some other methods. I could still exchange this TV if I so pleased, but in my opinion, the time, nor the hassle is really worth it, this doesn't effect my viewing, and has the possibility of going away on it's own. So overall, I would recommend this TV to a friend or anyone else for that matter, you're more than likely not to get a screen that has a dead/stuck pixel on it anyhow.edit: btw this is a review for the 50 inch model, according to some other reviewer the content on the 60 inch model is much more pixelated, but if you're in the market for a 42/47/50, and possibly even 55 inch model, than you can't go wrong here.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nearly cinema-like experience", "Author": "Dienne", "ReviewID": "R3GTPIGUM7X4QM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's only been a couple years since my family and I entered the world of flat screen TV, and our first was quite small.  Wow, what a change from the old massive, curve-screen clunkers I've known all my life.Despite a screen that's much bigger than we've ever had before, this TV is quite light.  Even I could lift the box into the house, and my husband was able to set it up on his own.Set up is fairly simple.  Just assemble the base and screw in the monitor.  The base is quite stylish and very stable.  If you prefer, it's also wall or ceiling mountable, but you'll have to buy the framing for that separately.  Once you've mounted the TV, hook up whatever other gadgets you have to go with your TV - antenna, cable, internet, DVD player, game consoles, etc.  As a typical smart TV, it's ready for anything you have to go with it, and it's very clear which cable goes where.  Set up took us a total of about 10 minutes.Once you've hooked everything up and turned it on, you may need to go through a brief start-up synchronization to find all your channels and and establish your settings (helpfully enabled with an on-screen reference system to adjust for backlight, sharpness, color, tint and other settings), but then you're ready to start the fun.Although it advertises a \"Magic Remote\", this TV came with a standard remote as the Magic Remote appears to be sold separately.  You can also use your phone to access and program this TV.The quality of your specific viewing experience, will, of course, depend on the quality of the device or service through which you are viewing.  Obviously, a Blu-ray or 3D DVD player will give a higher quality performance than a standard DVD player.  Similarly, if you are using an antenna, you might not get as good of reception as you would with cable, dish or high-speed internet.  But to the extent you have high-quality equipment and services, this TV is ready to handle it and give you maximum resolution for a crystal-clear, sharp picture.The 3D capability is especially exhilarating.  Because the TV is LED, any 3D glasses from your local cinema will do, but this TV also helpfully comes with four pairs of 3D glasses.  The 3D effects are truly like being in the cinema, if not in the movie itself.  I highly recommend getting a 3D DVD player to go with this TV.  There is also a library of 3D movies, but that requires a separate subscription.  Of course, the easy access to Netflix, Hulu and other services also require separate subscriptions.With Smart Sound Mode, the sound is clear and sharp even without hooking the TV up to any stereo equipment, although stereo equipment can certainly boost the sound experience and enhance movie, music and gaming experience, especially in the bass register.Because it is LED, this TV is also quite energy efficient.  It is estimated to add only approximately $8 to your annual electricity bill.Overall, we couldn't be happier with this TV.  We put it in my husband's \"man cave\" where he and, sometimes, the kids have been enjoying the theatre quality experience for a couple weeks now.  The TV appears to be defect-free and working effectively.  I have no concerns at this point regarding longevity, but I will certainly update this review if we encounter any difficulties.

The 3d is awesome, internet apps are nice. A little glitchy at times but that's to be expected from tv apps. Picture quality is excellent. Probably not right on par with samsung's comparable model but that costs more with less features. The internet web browser is nice and actually usable. The tv plays mkv movie files and sound codec wich was a huge selling point for me. I can stream all my movies from my desktop to tv using PLEX app from PC over home network. This is the reason I got this tv. Games and blu rays look great with a little tweaking of picture settings. And there is a lot of settings which is nice. My only complaints are, didn't come with magic remote so I had to buy that separately and that gives me issues sometimes but it's really nice to have. My other complaint is that the internal sound is mediocre at best. Although that is to be expected. It does have a bunch of sound settings and that's nice. Most hdtvs have garbage speakers anyways. Surround sound is a must with this tv. Overall if your debating on getting this tv don't think about it anymore and just get it. You won't be disappointed.

It is wall mounted with a swivel and pivot wall bracket. Amazon had a software update to add the Amazon Prime App for most 2013 LG models in September. Unfortunately the app update was not available for the this model yet. HOWEVER, I used the link for the 47LA6200 and was able to get it to update my model with the Amazon Prime App. It is working flawlessly!!! We also use Netflix, Vudu, Pandora, Web Browser, 3D content, and try different features all the time. For just over 600 dollars, it has an incredible picture....amazing clarity, sharpness, and fast refresh rate. The colors are brilliant.NOTE: I have read about a customer having issues with DSE on the 47 inch version of this set. DSE is known as 'dirty screen effect\". On our 42LA6200 we have seen it a few times only on all white backgrounds, but in our case it has only been when the screen is in a holding pattern between App clicks and switching between HDMI and AV modes. I have not experienced it during any movies, kids cartoons, or sports like live hockey. I have a picky eye, and this isn't a concern for us.Hope this helps!I also own:-2010 LG 55 inch 3D LED/LCD that has some apps but it isn't in the \"Smart\" category.

My couch is around 7ft away from the tv. So the viewing distance is perfect in my opinion. If I  had bigger living room or my viewing distance was greater than 10ft, I would get a bigger screen size. If you are getting this solely for the 3d feature, bigger screen size is always better. When viewing the 3d on my LG tv I have to be directly facing the TV and not viewing from an angle. I previously had a Vizio 26in and was ready for an upgrade. This is a great upgrade. The picture is beautiful. I like the energy saving features on this TV as well. There's a Minimum, medium, and maximum energy saving feature. The TV stand is nice looking. The stand is recessed behind the TV and it gives the a floating in air look. The smart tv apps are great. There's Netflix, pandora, amazon instant video, Hulu, and many more features I have yet to try out such as the games. There's a feature called On TV now that partially works. Basically the feature categorizes movies and shows that are currently showing on your cable subscription. It partially works because the Lg Magic remote that is sold separately is needed to select the shows on this features menu. If I were to give this TV a con it would be not having the magic remote included with the TV. I will say there is lg smart tv app I have downloaded on my iPhone. This app lets me control the smart tv apps but not the the TV cable channels. I'm not sure why the app will not change my tv channels. Lastly the TV remote included does not light up!

I paid A LOT for this TV and it served me and my family well, but it was starting to show signs of it's age so I started talking to my wife about upgrading to a newer TV.  We decided to wait a bit as we noticed the prices of modern HDTVs were starting to come down.  After receiving a surprise bonus from my employer my wife finally gave me the thumbs up to purchase a new TV.I wasn't really sure where to start, so I headed down to Best Buy just to look.  I knew I wouldn't buy from them, but I wanted to see the TVs on and \"in action\" before making my decision.  Everyone told me to buy a Samsung, but something about LG kept bringing me back.  Not wanting to spend my whole bonus, I decided to go with a 42\" (the size we currently owned) as it was a good fit for our living room.  We knew we wanted a smart TV with Netflix as that service is a huge lifesaver with having two small children.  Neither of us cared that much of owning a 3D HDTV, but when crunching the numbers and comparing the different models we figured why not since the price difference wasn't much at all.  I also took the time to learn the difference between active and passive 3D and was sold on passive.After doing all my homework I decided on this particular LG model and Amazon by far had the best price.  I was a little nervous buying a TV from an internet retailer, but rest assured Amazon delivered on all levels.  I also grabbed a new HDMI cable and picked up the extended warranty through LG just to be safe.  I wanted to buy LG's 3D BluRay player, but my wife said no (ended up w/ a $99 Phillips 3D player from Target).Installation of the TV was very easy, including the WiFi.  Picture looks great, built in apps work well - though the navigation screen takes some getting used to.  The included remote is easy to use, but make sure you pick up the Magic remote (sold separately) if you want to do all the things mentioned in the description.  My only complaint about the TV is the glare and the sound.We have two regular sized windows in our living room and during the day there is a bit of glare making it harder to see the picture.  It's not that bad, but it's more noticeable than our old Toshiba TV.The other downside is the speaker...and I was already informed about this going in thanks to a very helpful Best Buy associate.  With the thin frame on new TVs as I was told, the speakers had to be moved to either the back of the set or on the bottom.  Well it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you're not going to get very good sound if it's being projected to the wall behind the set or straight down (esp. if you didn't wall mount your set, like me).  Again this was easily resolved by buying one of LG's sound bars, but that again was another extra expense we didn't want to take on.All in all I love the TV.  Now that I've added a 3D BluRay player and a sound bar I feel as if I'm all set.  The 3D looks great and the included glasses are easy to wear and even fit over regular eye glasses.  If you're looking for a great Smart 3D HDTV and don't want to break the bank, then this model is for you.  Just make sure you upgrade the sound using some sort of external sound bar.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV of the future is coming from LG", "Author": "Vero", "ReviewID": "R131XYY191H3MY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy too use, easy to set up, has all of the plug ins .

It took a while to get it fine tuned, though.When I first hooked it up directly to my Directv tuner, the audio was horribly out of synch with the video. I eventually tried some of the other HDMI inputs and it improved a little bit. For a while, I thought I wouldn't be able to use my HDMI2 input, but I did a firmware update and it appears to have improved it.I had the same issue with my stereo receiver even on the inputs that weren't having issues with the Directv tuner. Fortunately that has settings to adjust the delay. Its amazing how bad having the audio 70ms ahead of the video can look. I had previously been using all of the same equipment with an older 46\" Samsung LCD that never had these audio sync issues. I don't know if I was lucky or if is truly a problem with LG.The televisions 2D picture is very nice although I had to turn off the Trumotion feature. Ironically, it was making the picture stutter at times.I haven't been able to try a true 3D picture unless you count some free movie trailers in the Smart apps. The picture tended to give me a headache before the trailer was finished playing.. I wasn't impressed by the 2D->3D conversion the few times that I tried it. It didn't seem to do anything from what I could see.The Smart apps are unimpressive. There is no Amazon Instant Video app as of this time. You can rent 3D movies, but they run between 6 and 8 dollars per rental. Unless you plan to rent 3D movies, you are much better off with a Roku player.Overall, I'm a bit disappointed in the available apps and the 3D, but the price was still pretty good for a 55\" TV and the 2D picture is very good after I got past the audio synch issues.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Karen G.", "ReviewID": "R1TN95JMDIBY74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has everything I was looking for.

Since I had read that it was backlit instead of edge-lit, I was hoping that it would not suffer from the screen uniformity issues that have plagued the other edge-lit sets I had tried.

These issues show up anytime the set is displaying any scrolling or panning shot of anything lighter colored, such as sky, ground, or even faces. You'll notice that there are a few clearly defined \"bands\" of darker screen, as well as a general dirty look as if there were smudges on the screen that you can't clean off. These tend to worsen as the set gets more hours on it, or perhaps you just get better at noticing them. Some people are more sensitive to these issues than others, so your mileage may vary.

Great buy.Very happy with this TV.  The picture quality is great.  I was originally going to get a plasma TV, due to the fact that picture quality is better (unless you spend a lot of money to get area dimming back lights on LEDLCD TV to match the deep blacks of plasma).  Plus the image replication for what the intended picture is supposed to look like is also superior on plasma.I ended up going with this TV, because since many TV companies stopped making plasmas, there is not a very good selection any more.  For a 3D Smart-TV I could not find anything with a comparable price and quality.  Samsung had the closest matches for about $150 more.Pros:- Picture quality is great.  I am very happy with it.  The Vivid picture setting is amazing on nature shows like BBC life.- I don't notice any flaws in the picture quality.  Some other reviewers said there was backlight bleed thru, but that was not the case with my TV- The picture settings recommended by reviewer GatorJ are very good and produce the best image in my opinion.- The Smart Share feature is incredible.  I stream movies/shows/pictures directly from my PC over wifi.  The TV works flawlessly as an all in one media center.  Also, it can easily stream video and pictures from my phone.- I was not aware before buy this TV that it could also be controlled by my smart phone (Glaxay S3).  The remote it comes it is good for navigating the apps, but very cumbersome for using the web browsing.  I downloaded the app for my phone and thought the cursor control would be gimicky and plagued by poor response time.  I was very happy to find that the response time is incredible and it feels as effortless to use as the touchpad on my computer.  When clicking a text box on the TV, the text pad on my phone pops up and allows me to type with it.  Very cool feature, but only really needed for web browsing and possibly some games-The 2D-to-3D conversion actually works quite well.  I was very impressed.  The 3D is, obviously, not as pronounced as content made for 3D, but it does a great job to add depth- The 3D works well overall except for some minor problems noted in the Cons.  Honestly, I would not buy a TV just for the 3D feature, since there isn't a lot of 3D content out there right now.- Gaming on this TV is good too.  I have not noticed any delays or latency problem as other TVs have- The TV is surprisingly light.  When the deliver man brought the TV, I embarrassingly asked for help to carry it inside.  Little did I know I could carry the weight with one hand!~ (This is for the 42\"; about 25lbs)- The bezel is very thin and look amazingly sleek.  The design is smooth and unobtrusive.- Setup was simple.  I had it turned on in about 10 minutes.Cons:- 3D is good, but it seems highly dependent on the content being watched.  Some 3D media is absolutely terrible to watch (many 3D youtube videos).  This could be due to the settings I had on, but I've messed around with them and if there is a sweet spot it is difficult to find.- I watch Jurassic Park 3D on this TV with the Auto 3D setting and it seemed like there were a few moments in the movie where the 3D was very disorienting.- I setup the video based on GatorJ's review and it looks fantastic!  However this took about 10 minutes to match all of his detailed settings and save it to the profile \"Expert1.\"  The bad is that this seems to be application/input dependent and my Expert1 profile does not retain the saved settings on other apps/inputs.  It'd be a huge pain to have to set this up for each individual app/input I use.  I'm waiting for LG to release software update to hopefully fix this.-The Smart Share feature is great, I only had problems when trying to stream a 1080p 3D movie from my PC, then it became laggy.  This is completely understandable.  Streaming a 16GB movie would be a feat in and of itself.  It could be related to my network and/or PC though.- There aren't a ton of apps for this TV, Netflix and HuluPlus are available, but Amazon Prime TV is not.  I've heard an update is going to provide more apps in the future.Overall this TV is the biggest bang for your buck.  Unless you're willing to downgrade to poorer quality brand, I would recommend this TV.  The price for the value is great.  And knowing that LG is one of the top most reliable TV brands on the market, gives me comfort that I'll have this TV around for a long time.([...]([...]I haven't been able to test the dual play feature, but a word of advise, don't buy the glasses.  Just put two left eye lenses in one pair of glasses and the right eye lenses in the other pair to achieve the same effect.

Something that's not mentioned in any of the descriptions is that the stand is designed to enable you to physically swivel the TV to the sides a few inches if you watch from an angle different than your normal viewing position.  Some cons: 1)  sound quality is average to mediocre.  Sometimes it seems as if music or special effects overwhelm the virtual center channel.  Even with the surround feature turned off I've still noticed the issue at times.  There is an adjustment called \"clear voice\" (I think) that helps with the problem but doesn't eliminate it.  I use a full 5.1 AV surround setup so it's not that big of an issue for me.  2)  I hate the \"true motion\" (or whatever it's called.  It seems most annoying when watching classic black and white films.  Makes them look as if they were shot on videotape.  Not natural looking at all.  The TV comes with this feature automatically turned on so try turning that off if you don't like the resulting picture.  3) No Amazon Prime app!

All I can say is WOW. This TV great. The picture is amazing and the 3D is great (when playing a 3D movie).But before I go any further let me warn you about something. When you order the TV it doesn't come from Amazon but from a dealer called Paul's TV.When you order, Amazon will give you a date that is automated. Amazons dates are usually 5 - 7 days. But the actual shipping time is 5 - 14 days. This is not a false advertising. It's an issue with Amazon and Paul's TV. I did not receive my TV on the date that Amazon had quoted. When I contacted Paul's TV they explain to me the order issues and conflict with the shipping dates. Needless to say I was very upset when I didn't receive my TV on the dates quoted but let me assure you that Paul's TVs costumer service was outstanding. I've never had better customer service anywhere. After hearing my complaint they did everything in their power to get my TV to me as fast as humanly possible. They even gave me a DVD player just for my troubles. Would I buy from Paul's TVs again? Yes!!Ok now the TV. The picture is amazing. It runs at 120 Hz to reduce blur, but I'm a movie guy and I like most movies the way they are. I usually turn it off. The sound is ok for TV speakers but I bought a sound system so I didn't use them much. The 3D simulated mode is ok. I've watched Cars 2 in 3D mode with my son and it looked good but not great. We also watch Ice Age 3 3D blu-ray and it looked amazing. The TV apps that come on broad are the standard viewing app I.E. Netflix, Hulu, and you can download more from the LG app site. You can surf the web but I strongly recommend a wireless keyboard. I bought a logictec wireless keyboard with built in mouse and it works great. It has 3 HDMI and 3 USB ports. The USB ports except most thumb drives or portable hard drives. I've watched a few movies from my hard drive and they ran smoothly. It has an optical sound port but I recommend HDMI for sound. In closing I recommend this TV. There are a lot more good things I can say about it but I'm out of time. And I highly recommend buying it from Paul's TV.Thanks for reading.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderfully Bright Gorgeous TV!", "Author": "Tracey Carter", "ReviewID": "R32ZILVOYNEO5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV. It is the perfect size for a townhouse without being overwhelmingly huge. It would also be a good size for master bedrooms if you're inclined to have a TV in the bedroom.Set-up was very easy and hooking the TV up to my home wireless network took less than ten minutes, however, I've helped friends set up their SmartTVs and have experience setting up and troubleshooting home networks. If you've never set up a wireless TV before you may need a little bit of patience but if you follow the directions and reset routers and modems etc. as needed you shouldn't have too much trouble with it.So far I haven't been able to get Amazon Video to work on this SmartTV which is kind of a bummer if you have Amazon Prime but it looks like the SmartTV comes with apps for most of the other major streaming services (Netflix, etc.), none of which I have, of course. For streaming the Amazon Prime videos I hooked my PS3 up to the TV and then use the Amazon Video app on the PS3, so all is right with the world :)I haven't tried the 3D viewing yet but I'll be sure to update my review once I do. One great positive of this TV is that it came with not one, not two, not three, but FOUR pairs of 3D glasses which is great for families. My parents' 55'' Sony TV is also 3D ready but didn't come with any glasses which adds a bit of expense so it's wonderful that LG includes these with the TV.Overall I'm very pleased and am tickled pink to have found a wonderful TV. I'm usually a Samsung TV fan but I think I'm converted after seeing how wonderfully crisp, clear, and bright the picture is on this LG TV. And, if you don't like the picture for any reason, there are so many settings and options to be played with and tweaked, luckily I found one of the preset settings that worked well with my Comcast cable and makes everything super clear and wonderful.I can't speak to how easy or challenging it is to wall mount this TV as I have it setting on top of my old TV stand. On its base it seems very sturdy and secure. I have no complaints and would be happy to purchase LG TVs in the future.LG products are also long-lasting, quality products. We have an old (I don't even remember how old!) flat-screen HD tube LG TV that is still crisp and clear and bright and other than being very very heavy is still a wonderful TV. I'm hopeful that this new LG TV will last us just as long :)", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG 42 3d", "Author": "Tyler T.

It performs well on movies and gaming. However, can lag on certain TV shows, becoming more apparent on the commercials, than the actual show itself. However, I believe that this may have more to do with our cable provider than the TV itself.3D:The 3D feature is brilliant. As expected, with a 3D source the TV performs wonderfully. A nice feature is the 2D to 3D conversion. So, if you are wanting to experience 3D but do not have a 3D source at the moment, you can convert a traditional 2D movie to 3D on the fly. But note, that since you are converting from 2D to 3D, the picture or 3D quality is not going to be exactly the same as something that was natively 3D to begin with.Smart TV functions:It is nice to be able to use a full web browser on the TV. While the browser is adequate, streaming from sites, such as Crunchyroll, can be a pain. Whether it is lag or waiting on the site itself, using the browser in place of an app is not always a great experience.The TV comes preloaded with Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Crackle to name a few. Currently, the app selection is a little on the low side. With apps such as Amazon Instant Video and Crunchyroll not having native support at this time. Therefore, before getting rid of your external player (such as Roku), make sure that the apps you currently use are available on this tv / LG app store.The lack of apps and still needing to keep a Roku at this time is really not a huge deal, since this TV supports the usage of Plex Media Server (From smart menu go to Video - Linked Device). We currently use Plex Media Server for various reasons, so having this ability was a wonderful addition and surprise.Overall, this TV was beyond a pleasant surprise. This was our first smart TV, and would purchase LG TVs again in a heartbeat.Note: This TV does not come with the LG Magic Remote.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good value, good picture quality & smooth 3D viewing", "Author": "Amy Willingham", "ReviewID": "R3L9SSH03GZGJV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I currently own an LG Cinema Screen 47LM8600 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz Dual Core LED-LCD HDTV but this LG replaced a regular 32-Inch LCD that I had in my bedroom. Since I have owned my 47LM8600 for about a year now I will be comparing this new 42LA6200 to it. (I have also done a review of my 47LM8600 right here on Amazon if you wanted to check it out)--Setup--The setup of this TV was really easy to do. TV came well packed and was easy to take out of the box. I do suggest you have someone help you while you take it out of the box and setup the stand to mount the TV. The stand comes in 2 pieces and only needs 2 screws and about 5-10 min to get the stand and the TV in place. After this step all that is left to do is plug in all of your plugs, make sure your blu-ray/dvd, cable box/dish, and any other devices (such as wifi) are connected and turned on as needed. *Please note that for proper SMART TV setup your wifi should already be turned on due to the TV setup steps procedure. Now it is time to turn on your TV! Follow the steps for easy setup which include: language, cable box/dish setup (On my 47LM8600 I had trouble setting this up but when I hooked up my dish to this TV I had no issues at all for after about 10min I got all of my channels)and wifi setup ( just make sure your wifi is turned on, you have your wifi name and your password handy- if you do not have these things it will let you go back to this step at a later time) This process took  me about 15min to complete due to the slow process of connecting my dish to the TV.--Design--I do like the design of this TV. Thin and not too bulky at the back plus it is not too heavy. The 32 that I took out was actually a lot heavier than this TV, if you can believe that. Now when I compare the design to my 47LM8600 I have to admit that I enjoy my 47LM8600 design more. The screen here doesn't go all the way to the edge as it does in the 47LM8600, which in my opinion helps to add in picture viewing but is also more attractive. Here you have less than 1/2 an inch of screen border all the way around. Also the back of the 47LM8600 is much thinner. But the TV stand for the 42LA6200 is more attractive as in it is not as bulky and the color is darker.--Picture--The picture quality is very clear. I have always been impressed with the quality of LG, and this TV doesn't let down. You can see the pictures sharp and clear in 2D and also 3D. The TV also has additional abilities to change picture settings and an energy feature. Switching from 2D to 3D is very simply, just a push on the remote marked 3D and your off. The 3D pop is great and it looks to jump out about a foot or a little more away from the stand. From past 3D TV viewing I can say that the pop out feature varies a lot depending on what you are watching. We have noticed a greater pop in animation movies then live action and if watching live action, movies that actually made for 3D. Now when I compare my 47LM8600 (which has 240Hz) & 42LA6200 (which has 120 Hz) on the same settings (the same color mode etc) I can see a slight difference in picture quality. On my 47LM8600 pictures look sharper and clearer but the difference is not too great and if I didn't have this TV (or the ability to walk from room to room to do a side by side comparison) I honestly wouldn't know or see a difference. With the price difference between the TV's (upgrading this 42 to the 47) I still feel that having this 42 in the 47 is a great value for the picture quality you are receiving even without the 240Hz.--SMART TV--I really enjoy all the additional features this TV comes with. The ability to go onto Netflix, search the web, watch youtube, and tons of other things right there on my TV with just a push of the remote makes things so much more convenient. Connecting is really easy and I have encountered no issues trying to get on any of these online features.--The Remote--The motion remote is not included, but it looks really cool! The standard remote that it comes with works just fine but it can be a little temperamental when trying to use the online features.  Since I am so use to my 47LM8600 magic motion remote having to use this one has been hard for me but it still works fine.--Conclusion--For the price tag, picture quality, 3D viewing and all of the online features I feel this TV is a great buy. User friendly, easy to setup, and it also has an attractive design. Now when comparing it to my 47LM8600, I honestly still do prefer my 47LM8600 due to its screen design and it's slightly better picture quality. But when checking the price tag between the two (if I were to make the 42 a 47) I would still be 100% satisfied with this TV even taking in the difference of the 240 Hz and 120 Hz.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Smart TV", "Author": "Richard G.

But not like that would matter, because this is apparently a known issue with the model.

This was the next best deal for me at just 1,000 total and an excuse to buy five more inches of tv, lol.Pros:*Price Rate among the best,*Design is very nice,*Very Easy Installation (I just put on stand),*Easy Set Up,*I was very concerned about wifi reception as some of my internet devices are usually unstable but the tv wifi connection is surprisingly very stable and performs better than my roku does.*No problems with youtube videos crashing for me in youtube app or in the browser (I didn't try any especially long videos)*Picture quality is great*3D works great!*Sound is ok, I think we all realize its not going to be as good as surround sound or a sound bar but met my expectations.*TV supports many different video formats, in fact I haven't had an issue yet.  I usually play all videos through samsung blu ray player, but when it can't support the video format, LG TV to the rescue.*LG App is pretty cool.*Well packaged*Operates as expected with no issues.*My friend owns this tv in the 240 hz model and we honestly can't tell a difference between the two, but then again, we aren't videophiles.Cons:*If you don't have a good cell phone with IR blaster, you really do need the smart remote that doesn't come with this set. I personally have a Note 3 which handles it well and still struggles sometimes to keep up with image on tv.  but for less capable phones the app will be a poor performer.  I still kind of wish I had the smart remote but the app is pretty cool too.  last I check the remote was approximately 100.00 so at that price point, I'll just have to do without for now.*There also is some glare but to me it really isn't that bad, I just turn off the offending light, but I guess experiences will vary there.*I didn't realize that you had to purchase a camera for the tv if you wanted to use the skype function, I guess I thought the camera was built in, but its actually an accessory you have to purchase.  Guess I probably should of figured that.All of those cons weren't bad enough for me to take away a star, but if you don't have a high end phone, you will certainly regret not having the smart remote.Very happy with my purchase.

I am not able to use the tv directly to the internet to play my Amazon movies because my connection is less than 1 MB.

This TV has a great picture, almost free of juddering and ghosting as many mid-range 120hz TVs suffer from.

This means that unless you have curtains that can effectively shut the outside light out of your viewing room, you'll see your reflection on the screen in all of the darker scenes. If you watch movies and TV mostly at night, this shouldn't be a big issue, but if you watch lots of TV during the day in a room that has lots of sunlight coming in, you may want to opt for a matte screen so as not to see your own refection in it while trying to watch a movie.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Arrived broken, Great service replaced item no hassle. thanks!", "Author": "Steven Wiggin", "ReviewID": "R30TTB4VCMHP08", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item arrived broken, not sure if by UPS or handlers, but regardless I contacted seller, they replaced the item with 0 hassle and paid for the shipping to send the old one back.

The screen is very reflective, even with the closed curtain.Smart TV contains mostly of paid services such as Netflix, movie rental, buying games... Instead of Hulu app, you get Hulu Plus app, a paid subscription of Hulu.  Fortunately, there is no paid version of YouTube.  Otherwise, LG would remove YouTube app and replace it with the paid version app.I could not find the EPG (channel program) listing for this smart TV!WIRELESS:Wireless does not work.  A short YouTube SD video freezes multiple times.  Then the TV would not connect to the net work.  I tried both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz band without any success.  The TV freezes and has to be unplugged to reset.  For the 6 months I own this TV, it went through multiple firmware updates, twice in December 2013.  LG does not tell you what the new firmware is supposed to improve.  Finally I bought a gigabit cable to connect to the gigabit port in the router.WIRED:Speed Test:  Using speedtest.net, this TV has an download speed just below 20 Mbps.  Then I unplugged the TV Ethernet cable (using the same 50' cable) and plugged into the computer, I got around 44 Mbps.  Of course the TV will not perform as well as the I5 processor computer.  I wonder if the 55% reduction in speed vs. computer is acceptable?  Maybe someone can elaborate.With wired connection, it can load YouTube video with minimal freezes. However, the TV does not have enough memory to load large video. For example, when I try to watch boxing replay video on HBO. com/boxing, I got the message \"Not enough memory to load this page\" on the TV screen.  After some reloading, I was able to get the Froch vs. Kessler fight on for a few seconds.  Then it froze.It comes down to price vs. performance.  I got my 50\" on sale from Adorama for over 100 below amazon  price and I still thought it was overprice.  Unfortunately, tv over 40\"  is not returnable on adorama.

The web browser isn't the best, so don't buy it based on that function because you will be disappointed. I had planned to watch some episodes from different tv channel websites, but it doesn't always work. But according to LG, that is the websites' fault, not the web browser/tv. Just don't expect all websites to function the same as they would on your computer. That's just not going to happen. I actually was going to exchange this tv for a Samsung F6300 because of the web browser. But I found some major flaws in Samsung F6300. When I was using smart features (e.g. netflix, web browser, etc), the screen would turn green or freeze. And the browser wasnt any better than the LG. Comparing the picture, sometimes LG was better. So I stuck with the LG in the end - anyways I wouldn't have kept a tv that was freezing all the time. I am really happy with my LG now, especially after comparing it to the Samsung F6300. LG is clearly better quality on many levels. Picture quality is fabulous. I am not sold on the 3D option - I'll have to test it again. Smart features work really well  on this tv too.

This is my first LG TV and overall pretty satisfied with it.  Setup was easy, WIFI worked great. Found some good reviews for setting up the picture and that was pretty easy.  I have a Toshiba 3D 47\" that I paid something like $1299 for (it also came with a blu ray player) and it definitely has a better 2D picture overall but again, it was $400 more.  As for the 3D I prefer the Cinema 3D that LG offers vs the active that my toshiba has.  The glasses are way more comfortable and I don't get the Flickering effect from the active shutter glasses, plus the 2D to 3D is a cool feature although not as good as a Blu ray 3D movie.I do have to agree with previous reviews on the \"Cable\" feed HD picture quality.  It is not as good as I would like but I'm guessing that is because of Comcast Cable not being in 1080P.  The blu ray looks great.  My Toshiba does a better job making the lower quality cable feed look like true 1080P quality. Fast motion camera gets \"grainy\" and it becomes very apparent if you are sitting closer to the TV.  I would not buy this TV if your couch is less then say 6 or 7 feet away from the Tv.  If your room is small the stick to a 47\" or something like that or spend the extra money and get a higher end/model Tv.Overall for the price this is a great buy.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "me gusta", "Author": "Pogo", "ReviewID": "R2HJIYKFKEQXDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "never before was i this happy with a major purchase.  out of the box this unit was great.  sure, theres some issues that occur with led technology, but thats only an issue with a white background.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV ever", "Author": "ursa1", "ReviewID": "R2I5M9VGN58FGT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The slim bezel allowed me a larger screen size for the same width as my ole 37\" Samsung plus Smart TV ANC 3D", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "Ivan", "ReviewID": "R2TSM9FVW5KUJ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far so good .

The picture quality in both 2D and 3D are impressive and the Smart TV features are nice.Hardware and Set upUnpacking and setting up went quickly.  The TV itself is fairly light - so I had no problem getting it out of the box, installing the stand, and placing it onto my A/V stand.  All of this took me roughly a half hour, even while working slowly.  The stand is attached with 8 screws and are like slick legs in its shape.  The stand does not allow the TV to tilt forwards or backwards but it does rotate from side to side at about a 45 degree angle each way.  The TV itself is very thin, approximately 1.5\", with a dark silver 1\" brushed steel looking outer bezel.  The combination of the TV and stand, to me, looks very sleek and modern which is aesthetically pleasing.The unit has four HDMI inputs, a 1/8\" headphone jack, a digital optical out, three USB 3.0 inputs,  and two 1/8\" jacks for composite and component video signals using the supplied adapter cables. There is an additional 1/8\" jack for the IR blaster adapter -(supplied) for connecting other devices that you would like to be controlled by the LG TV's remote. There is a LAN input for connecting your internet router directly to the TV via an ethernet cable (cable not included) which is what I am doing.  There is also a coax cable input for direct cable or for an OTA antenna.Initial TV starting set up was quick and without any hangups.  It involved things like setting up your location, and connecting to the internet. The process took about 15 minutes.There are some reviews mentioning the poor quality of the sound from the onboard speakers.  For me, the LG TV replaced a large, 56\" LCD panel and I will say that the sound difference was quite noticeable.  The LG lacked the bass and overall fullness that the larger TV put out.  But honestly, in my case that was to be expected due to the size difference between the two TVs.  After about a day or two of using the LG TV, I had completely forgotten about it.  Some may find the sound a bit thin but overall, I think it's fine.Picture QualityThe images are bright, well saturated, and detailed creating a nice depth in the picture.  I watch quite a bit of fast action sports and I'm very pleased that there was hardly any blurring of the motion.  Watching 3D is also a real pleasure.  I'm using the TV in combination with an LG BP530 3D BluRay player and the 3D imaging is outstanding.  The 3D glasses the TV comes with (four pairs) are light and require no batteries.  I also have 3D glasses for a Samsung TV that require batteries and it's a real hassle when you're in the mood to watch a 3D movie and the batteries need to be recharged.  I wear the LG 3D glasses over a pair of prescription glasses and they fit comfortably on my face.  After a few minutes, I don't even realize they are there.This TV unfortunately doesn't come with the Magic Remote like the GoogeTV version does.  You could purchase the remote separately, though.  LG does have a smart phone app that allows you to use you phone as a remote.  I haven't downloaded it yet but some of the reviews on it look pretty good.LG Home DashboardThe TV comes with some apps preloaded and I've found the ones I mostly use now are YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu.  I really like the YouTube app because the layout and general navigation within the app is much better than the YouTube app on my Samsung 3D SmartTV, which doesn't seem as intuitive.  In fact,  the overall layout of LG's Home navigation screen is very well laid out and intuitive.  The icons are large and categorized nicely.  The Netflix and Hulu apps stream content solidly.  The Hulu app is one advantage I've found with this TV since it's not included with the GoogeTV version of this television.The LG 42\" Cinema 3D LED HDTV certainly exceeded my expectations.  The picture is sharp and bright and holds up well when watching fast-paced sports or action movies.  The 3D picture quality is superb and a blast to watch.

In this day and age, where everyone is obsessing about picture quality(I mean heck 1080p is now a thing of the past, 4k here we go.) for LG to even let these things out of the factory like this with no tests, is ridiculous. Where is the quality control?!?! As others have mentioned built in speakers suck.(not a deal breaker though) The 3D is awesome the 2D to 3D conversion is a sweet feature. Besides the dirty screen effect, the picture quality is superb. After the hassle another amazon customer had to go through regarding the DSE, it left me extremely discouraged about contacting LG or amazon about my issue.

I asked the manager if I could bring up a few movies to try out with the 2D to 3D conversion.After receiving approval to do so,  I brought up a few of my Disney films and a 2 of my live action films.  To say I was impressed would be a huge understatement.  I was dumbfounded by the picture quality and the depth of the 3D.  I was also intrigued by the new remote control which was kinda like a Wii remote control which is called the magic remote.  I found I was able to stream Netflix , HuluPlus, VUDU and Amazon Prime with this incredible device.  I was also able to surf the internet with the single press of a button and convert many films that are 2D and will never see the beauty of 3D in just that, 3D .I have 3 young children and they love watching movies such as Pocahontas, Tarzan, Aladdin and many other Disney Classics in 3D.  This television is top of the line and very advanced in technology.  The screen is glossy and it comes with not two but four pairs of 3D glasses.  The glasses are light weight and have a very nice feel to them.  The great news about this particular television is that the same 3D glasses from the movie theater will work on this television.

Their issues were with Refrigerators, Washer & Dryers...etc. I own 4 HDTV's; (2) 32\" Vizio's, 37\" Vizio, and my favorite 65\" Samsung UN65ES6500.  I really wanted another Samsung, but my issue was this: I had a limited space (fam room credenza).  For the last 4 years, the 37\" Vizio was the TV in my fam room, simply because it \"fit\" into the credenza.  The Vizio 37\" has a 2\" bezel, so looking at the new HDTV's with 1/2\" bezel looked like a great opportunity to upgrade to a larger model, yet still fit into my credenza.  I had 38.5\" to work with.  The biggest Samsung was a 40\" (36.5\" wide).  The LG was a 42\" (38\" wide).  So I debated this for weeks and ultimately chose the BIGGER LG model.I am VERY PLEASED with my choice.  Picture is awesome, Smart functions all work well, setup was literally 15 minutes.  I have had the LG running for 3 days now, and it is meeting all of my expectations...EXCEPT ONE really confusing thing: The LG will not remember my WEP password...so every time we turned on the set, I had to put my 25 digit password...ANNOYING!!  Let me say this though, once connected, it works flawlessly.I went into the purchase knowing that the 2013 LG's did not have Amazon Prime Instant Video (even though the 2011 & 2012 ALL have it), but read several reviews that stated LG was updating firmware to include at some not too distant point in 2013.  But just like the Wireless password snafu, I just don't understand why LG would allow these two, seemingly easy to correct issues, hamper what I believe to be a GREAT HDTV.  In my mind, (see below) they are annoying, but do not take away from how this TV performs...simply spectacular.One additional POSITIVE: My 42\" LG was delivered by UPS in ONE day (ordered Sunday night, and arrived TUE) without a mark on the box.  Hail to UPS, as I was nervous about shipping method.So, for now LG only gets FOUR STARS... mainly because of the hassle factor.  Last night I ran an ethernet cable to the LG, so I have eliminated the WEP password issue... but they need to fix this, as I am not the only one stating that this is an issue.PROS:EAST SETUPSPARKLING HD PICTURELOTS OF EASY TO USE APPS/FEATURES ON SMART TVVALUE PRICED2 DAY PRIME SHIPPING VIA UPS - NO ISSUE AT ALLCONS:WIRELESS PASSWORD ISSUENO AMAZON PRIME INSTANT VIDEO (yet)I would certainly recommend this LG 42\" HDTV to ANYONE...buy with confidence.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor software design", "Author": "p2", "ReviewID": "R270EQYVILJU0T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It took me two weeks to figure out how to make ARC work.

It's a 42LE7300, which has now been relegated to the bedroom.My 42LE7300 has a metal back, glass front, and is about as wide as your thumb. The build quality is phenomenal.When comparing the new 42LA6200 my first thoughts are as follows. It's thicker than my old set, it's also ALOT lighter. At 54 pounds, my old set was a BEAST. The new set is 26 pounds, alot easier to move around. I would have rather had similar materials in this set, such as the glass front, and the metal construction. The 42LA6200 has a plastic shell, no cover for the screen and the materials dont seem as sturdy, but dont get me wrong, its still pretty well built. The one major qualm i have is this, the power buttons and such are on the back of the tv, they are on the side usually, this strikes me as odd, and i dont think ill use them much, but in the rare casse that I do, they are hard to reach.The picture is decent, I mean, you get to a point where it's simply a matter of personal preference. This picture should definitely satisfy your peepers.I haven't had much time to play around with the apps or the 3 d. But the offerings are abundant, and the App Store seems easy to navigate.The built in miracast is a lovely addition to this TV. Keeps me from having to use the netgear widi adapter that I had to with my old set. With it built into the new set, I simply open widi on my laptop and in Set to go. Another function which is quite handy is the smart share, I have my pic act as a media server, and in the past had to go through my ps3 to access downloaded content on my computer. The lg 42la6200 has this feature built in and works seamlessly with windows 8.One thing I found confusing is that the magic remote is heavily advertised, but does not come with the 42inch model, it is a separate purchase at 79$.The bottom line is this, if you're looking for a solid performing well built sub 1000 dollar tv, this set will not disappoint.

Gerla", "ReviewID": "R1FRSY20NFAKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My initial impression of the 60la6200 is that it is very stylish compared to the 60le640u it is replacing. The bezel is thin and the stand looks like something from Star Trek. It looks very nice, and although 3x deeper than an edge lit, the design plays nicely to the depth giving the illusion around the edges that the tv is still razor thin.After nearly two months of waiting for horrible light uniformity on the 60LE640U to go away, and hearing Sharps customer service tell me it was \"within manufacturer specifications\" I decided to pull the trigger on a direct lit. That said, I have a nearly perfectly uniform screen on this tv. There is a very slight, difficult to notice hot spot in the middle, but otherwise perfect. The black levels are good at night when you use the backlight dimming features, and the rest of the picture does not suffer. Also, as it is direct lit, the potential for banding exists, however, thus far, I have been unable to detect anything, even during sports.Although uniformity was the key for me, the wealth of features and responsiveness of this television have blown me away. The smart suite has everything we want and much more, and if it wasn't for software like XBMC, our HTPC would have been rendered useless.The only gripe I have is the CEC does not quite seem industry standard. It has a nice option to set audio playback by input, so you can choose whether you want external receiver or television speakers for each. However, when receiver is selected, the tv will not adjust the receiver input automatically as my sharp and Samsung tvs have in the past. So if multiple sources are connected to the receiver, you will likely have to manually change through them. The tv does have ARC tho, and therefore you may be able to get 5.1/7.1 passthrough. I have not looked into this yet, and it may be the solution, connecting all sources to the tv and outputting surround through ARC on HDMI1.I'll review more later, but hands down this is the most solid deal for the price range I've been able to find, and I'm extremely happy with my purchase.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great LED, 3D, Smart TV at a great price!", "Author": "Shevi \"FantasyWeaver\"", "ReviewID": "R3CGFM1GNF8B5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My family went looking for a new TV several months ago. After checking several different kinds in stores, I decided I wanted an LED TV. Those seemed to have the best picture quality. My husband decided that he wanted a Smart TV, as in a TV that can stream content. We both wanted something from a company with a good reputation. And while we oohed and ahhed over 3D sets, that whole flickering thing with the glasses of active 3D sets was annoying. Those glasses are also heavy and expensive, and they need to be charged. My family is always willing to pay extra for 3D movies, but it didn't seem practical to get the same experience at home. Plus we both wanted to find a TV that was reasonably priced.We ended up getting the LG 32LM6200 32-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses when it was on sale on Amazon--and it blew us away! It had all the things we wanted at a remarkable price. And the 3D is EXACTLY what you get in the movie theaters. I'm not kidding. My husband even likes to take our TV's glasses to the movies so he can be sure that he won't get a warped or dirty pair. And it's true: you can watch any video content--anything at all--in 3D! We've watched Eureka and Doctor Who in 3D, and it's amazing.This 42-inch LG TV is equally amazing when it comes to all the basics you could want: the picture is terrific, you can watch any video content in 3D with the same kind of glasses you would get at the movies, and it's a Smart TV so you can stream Netflix, Hulu, and a bunch of other stuff. One thing this TV has that the smaller set doesn't (aside from size) is amazing sound. I was truly blown away to discover that a TV like this could have great sound without an additional sound system.It does have a few issues, all of them minor and none of them involving the basics, just the bells and whistles.This TV doesn't come with a Magic Remote, and that's needed for voice recognition and some games. I don't think that's a loss. The 32-inch TV has a Magic Remote, and we hate it. You're constantly having to shake it to wake it up, and it's woefully inaccurate. The remote this comes with is much better, except for one super irritating feature in that the up arrow button is way too close to the \"smart\" or home button. This can be so annoying when you've spent a few minutes trying to input an email address only to get sent to the home menu because you were trying to move up on the keyboard. (We solved this by plugging a cheap remote keyboard that we had bought for the Wii into the back of the TV. Taa daa, easy text entry.) I considered buying the Magic Remote that is meant to work with this TV, but the reviews are so bad, I thought better of it. Oh, and by the way, you'll need to buy a web camera if you want to use this TV for Skype. I have no idea why you wouldn't rather use a tablet or laptop, but there you go. Maybe you want to see every one of your dad's nose hairs, or in my dad's case, his ear hairs. (He doesn't understand that a tablet isn't a telephone.) Anyway, it's an option.For now, the 42-inch doesn't work with Amazon streaming. This has me puzzled, because our 32-inch TV has it. If you have Amazon Prime, this could be a big deal. We mostly use Netflix for streaming, though, so it's not that big a deal for us.Oh, cool! I just noticed an announcement on the 32-inch set that Cut the Rope is now available from Game World. That's great, because until now I haven't found anything worthwhile with the games, except for Bejeweled, which would be ridiculous with the inaccuracy of the remote. We love Cut the Rope. You'll need a Magic Remote to play it, and we have that with the 32-inch set. The 42-inch TV isn't offering Cut the Rope or Bejeweled. I'm guessing the software will get updated at sometime in the future, but for now the content on the 42-inch TV is lacking.Except for Amazon streaming, though, none of that stuff matters. If you want to play games, you can buy a great game system with the money you save on this TV. We run a Wii and an X-Box with Kinnect on this TV, and it's terrific. And I'm confident that Amazon streaming will be available on the 42-inch sometime in the future. After all, it's already available on the smaller TV.Bottom line: this TV has everything we could possibly want in a TV--and more--at a great price.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Bad", "Author": "William R.

I love not having to use my PS3 to get on NetFlix even tho I prefer the PS3 app to the LG one.  The picture is crystal clear, it is in my bedroom and I keep it dark most of the time so the glare that others speak of is minimal.  The 50\" screen looks bigger because the border is only about a half an inch thick.  My main concern with my previous LG tv's was the black levels, it was really tough to discern objects in shadow or movies that were shot with a lot of dark scenes.  The one weird affect for me is how this tv brightens and diminishes lighting in different parts of the tv based on the scene helping to \"brighten\" the darker areas.  That was strange at first but I am getting used to it.  The only cons that I have are the remote (it does not light up, does not have a keyboard), and it only has 3 HDMI connections, a tv this size should have at least 4.  Overall, now that I have received a working unit, I am extremely happy with it.  Ohhhh...the 3D...very cool feature, I only have one 3D movie in my collection right now it was pretty cool to watch, now is it something I feel really adds to the value of the tv?

Packing box was in good shape but damp from water. Had the company take the box off and plug it in to run the power on test.

Used the remote and side power on buttons but the unit never showed any display or any power lights...it's dead. Went through Amazon CS and was quickly informed that another unit was available and would be sent out asap and I would be contacted by the shipping company.Appearance wise, the unit looks great and was very attractive. Slim, lightweight...everything I was looking for. Just wish it would have worked. I will update this review accordingly upon arrival of the next unit.*****************Update April 17, 2013**************************Amazon - 5 Star (No questions, instant ship on 2nd unit)CEVA Shipping - 2.5 Star (Late)TV - 4.5 StarsThe second TV arrived Tuesday. It was arranged by CEVA Logistics to arrive between 3:30pm and 7pm. That time came and went with no TV. I give the driver credit for fulfilling his drop-offs for the day, but the TV was finally delivered late at 9:15PM. Great to get my new TV, but bad on CEVA's part for the late delivery. Driver helped carry the TV into house, unpackage it and helped put it together with me (great service by driver!). Turned the TV on and instant screen this time. The TV base settings were \"Ok\" with the built in wizard, but it still doesn't seem right so I ordered a setup disc to get the best out of the TV. (Disney Wow: World of Wonder). Initially I couldn't get the built-in WiFi to find my wireless network, but I played around until I figured out I was using a different channel for my network (11) vs (6) which the TV needs. Setup wise, you may want to consider longer HDMI cables if you have a wider setup as you loose some length with the HDMI inputs on the left-side edge. My cable DVR box won't fit under the TV so I had to move it to the right side floor, and the 6 ft cable is at its limit. I'm still playing with the Tru-Motion settings to find a balance between juddery edges vs too much filler and making movies have the \"fast/vertigo\" effect. Lastly, I wish the base TV remote had a backlight button or sensor to light it up.

Here are the problems I've encountered so far:1. This TV is supposed to display program information in the upper left-hand corner of the screen, informing the viewer about the name of the program that is underway at the time the viewer switches to that particular channel. Instead, this TV displays, \"No program information.\" Moreover, the remote control has a button for \"Info.\" But, pressing the \"Info\" button on the remote simply toggles up a separate display saying, \"No program information.\" I have several other TV's of different brands. Each of them displays program information, and some of them are cheaper TV's than the LG. Only the LG doesn't display program information. I talked by telephone with an LG technical support person and was told that, in spite of the \"Info\" button being on the remote, \"LG no longer supports that feature.\"2. You can't watch all of the available channels. The auto program feature misses several active channels and won't let you access them manually or by pressing the channel number on the remote. My other LCD's miss the same channels when auto programming; but, on the other brands I can still access those channels by pressing the channel number on the remote. When I attempt to do the same thing on the LG, the TV switches to whatever channel is identified by the last number pressed on the remote. For example, one of the \"missed\" channels is 103.5 (or, 103-5 on the LG). When I attempt to press those digits on the remote, the channel changes to channel 5. The result is the same for each channel that was missed by auto program. The bottom line is that you can't watch any channel that wasn't found by auto program, even though those channels are being transmitted into your home by the cable company.3. You can't set closed caption to come on only when the TV is on \"mute.\" It is either \"on\" or \"off\" all the time. On my other TV's you can set the closed caption to come on when the TV is put on \"mute\" but not to come on when the sound is engaged; or, you can toggle between the two by pressing one button on the remote. Unless a viewer is hearing impaired, I can't see much sense in keeping both the sound and the closed caption on at the same time.4. Even with features that are present, so many of them are not intuitive and are not user friendly. For example, deleting a channel is a convoluted process that I had to figure out by trial-and-error. The \"manual\" supplied with the TV is very sparse, and the on-line User Guide is often vague or doesn't even cover a topic.  Conclusion: The LA6200 is a mid-to-lower-end TV priced as though it were an upper-end TV. The picture, the color, and the sound on the LA6200 are decent (middle-of-the-pack), but, in my opinion, they don't justify marketing this TV as being an upper-level TV that is competitive with similarly-priced TV's of other brands. It lacks too many features that are standard on almost all of the other brands I have seen. LG needs to either add/refine these features so as to make the LA6200 an upper-level TV, or it needs to market it at a much lower price point.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great but not user friendly", "Author": "Movie Mania \"DVD Collector\"", "ReviewID": "RESUPM6NJYOL0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Believe it or not, I am going from a digital TV (this TV is actually replacing an Analog TV! but the TV I watch the most is digital).  So, I cannot compare this to another HDTV, other than ones I see it the gym, bars and friends.  And from that point of view, the picture is comperable.This was shipped by UPS and delivered to my front door.  I wanted to use it in my upstairs bedroom.  The package was more cumbersome than heavy but I easily got it up the stairs without any help.  The TV is very well packaged and easy to remove from the carton.  The base comes in two pieces that have to be screwed together and this was the hardest part of assembling the TV (i.e. it took about 30 minutes from carton to working.)A standard remote was included with batteries and four 3-D glasses.  Because of the Smart TV, you need to connect the TV to your internet.  It has wifi and it is somewhat easy to connect.  The hard part is entering in the Wifi password.  Since you do not have a real keyboard, you have to enter it in with the left right up down keys on the remote. (The really bad part of this is you do not see the entered letters they appear as *'s only.  So if you make a mistake, its back to square one.)Smart TV has a lot of content including premium (pay extra) access to Net Flix, Hulu plus and the such.  It also has free access apps (well some are free apps but pay content) to a number of other web content.  But most are not worth the time.  The one good thing is that Verizon Fios subscribers can access limited content directly inlcuding Epix and HBO if your subscription includes this.You can also access your computer hard drive (whether you want to or not) using this to show pictures and stored videos.Now for some of the down points -The TV I have you can switch from tv to dvr to dvd with a push of the remote.  This you need to call up the menu choose input then the application.You will have to set the picture for each application.  I found the picture needed a lot of adjustment to make it look cinema quality.  But when I went from TV to DVD, I had to set it again.Finally, for the 3-D -Glasses are provided and if you have 3-D glasses from the movie theatre, they work too.Most 3-D today is not real 3-D.  Real 3-D is shot with two side by side cameras (to replicate two human eyes.)  This is what not only creates the depth in the picture but also captures the diffeneces in texture. (Stand just to the right side of someone and look at their face with your left eye only.  Then do the same on their left side.  Finally stand infront.  Each gives you a different view.  the right and the left gives you the gently variances for each side of the person that the front view does not.)  Real 3-D replicates this and gives the viewer a full 3-D image.  What most current 3-D does digitally change the picture to give it depth.  But what it really looks like is flat pictures at different depths of field.  And this is especially true for animated films that never had 3-D depth to begin with.So overall, 3-D is fun (and it has a 3-D button that turns some 2-D into simulated 3-D) but it is really not worth the extra money.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "claim for costs of TV if you're broken patalla Venezuelan recommend you read this and translate are one scammers", "Author": "Meyvi Sanabria", "ReviewID": "R1MJRXFK9EBDT1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The next claim is for the following reason I buy a TV smar tv cinema in his shop which came with the damaged screen.

Recently purchased and returned this set. It's definitely feature rich, the 3D can amaze with the right content. The Netflix is pretty good especially if you can get the 3D and Super HD thru your cable co. Now the bad news. When watching just thru your cable box or Tivo or whatever, this is the most pixelated mess I've ever seen. The motion is so disturbingly pixelated that you can't even concentrate on what your watching. So yes, pop in a blu ray 3D and be dazzled. But unless you're nearsighted, take out your Contacts and sit 20 feet away, this LED wil disappoint. Maybe we can blame the content provider and their 1080i signals but I disagree with that. The tech in the TV has to do the job of making that content look acceptable, like my 7 year Sony Bravia did. The blacks in this set also were disappointing. The sound from it's speakers was terrible too. For the three days I had it, I was constantly adjusting the settings and was never satisfied. One channel loud and the background music too high, the next channel was too low. Trust me folks this is a hugely disappointing set for even an average eye and ear. Only question that remains is, who are these people here who rave about this set. Do they only watch Blu Rays? I think not. Something tells me they may all have w-2's that say LG Inc. on them in their desk draws.  I HAVE TO ADD ANOTHER NOTE ON TO MY REVIEW. HAS ANYONE BUT ME NOTICED THAT ALL THE REVIEWS BUT MINE WERE FOR DIFFERENT SIZED SCREENS! HOLY COW! I'VE JUST REALIZED THIS. HOW CAN YOU COMPARE A 50\" OR 47\" TO A 60\"? THE WHOLE POINT OR MY REVIEW IS THAT THE TERRIBLE PIXELATION IS MORE APPARENT THE LARGER THE SCREEN. NO WONDER THE 50 LOOKS BETTER! THAT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN SCREEN SIZE! HOW CAN AMAZON GROUP THESE REVIEWS. WOULD YOU GROUP REVIEWS OF A TOYOTA RAV 4 WITH A REVIEW OF HIGHLANDER BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH TOYOTA TRUCKS. AMAZING INCOMPETENCE. AMAZINGLY MISLEADING!Well, this will be my final comment on this whole thing. It's exhausting battling a relentless corporate marketing machine masquerading as ecstatic consumers. Same wire, same TiVo same everything and the Vizio M601D is much better. It was apparent immediately that there was less pixelation with motion. And when I watched the LG it was so noticeable that it was distracting. Vizio Color is more pleasing and Blacks are Blacker on the Vizio. The sound is even superior and I did not expect that. Here's what I discovered, when you turn off the Image Smoothing feature on the Vizio, the Soap Opera Effect virtually disappears and you feel like your watching a movie theatre screen. Why do these sets do what they do with image smoothing anyway? It's my theory that Image Smoothing is what is creating all this interpolated information and thus creates the pixelation. And I'm of the opinion that it makes movies and TV look different and weird! On the LG when I turned image smoothing off, it merely reduced the Soap Opera Effect but never eliminated it. So already I can see that the settings on the Vizio seem to have a greater effect on the quality of the image. You really feel in control of the Vizio and if you like image smoothing then you can turn it on. I recommend you leave it off watching thru your cable box or TiVo. I was truly surprised, after adjusting the Audio on the Vizio, how rich the sound is. Much better than the LG. The Vizio apps are a bit less snappy and the Vizio will not force 2D into 3D. The LG does this with uneven results anyway. I watched the same 3D Super HD movie thru Netflix on both sets and I think even the 3D is a bit better on the Vizio. There are no settings for depth of 3D on the Vizio but I don't think it's necessary.  I noticed less flaws in the 3D with the Vizio. When you start watching 3D you'll know what I mean by 3D flaws. Why do I want to mess with depth and other 3D settings anyway? So the Vizio isn't perfect but it simply blows the LG LA6200 out of the water.
