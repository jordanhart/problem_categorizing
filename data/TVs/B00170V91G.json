Overall HD picture quality is good.- It has one VGA, one HDMI, one component video, one S-Video and one composite video input - pretty good for a cheap TV.- NO NEED FOR AC ADAPTER!! The power supply is built-into the TV cabinet.- Sleep TimerMINUS- Not very bright at all- Limited vertical viewing angle- Limted tilt; does not swivel from side to side- Anemic sounding speakers / slightly better after I adjust bass/treble- Mediocre picture quality as a PC monitorOverall, for $199 don't expect it to perform like a Sharp or a SONY but I give it 4 star based on its sheer value and it's HDTV picture quality.

We have about 15 Sharp Aquos tv's that we are very happy with, but Sharp stopped making the smaller screens.  There are really not that many options for small screen tv's.  I read the reviews on the Viewsonic and at first was hesitant, but decided to try one.  The picture is very good and since we watch them sitting at a desk, there is no problem with the viewing angle.  The sound is not very good, but acceptable for our purpose.

Unit also sits very low to the countertop, and doesn't have a swivel feature to allow it to be tilted upwards.  The viewing angle is critical .. like viewing a projection TV .. you must look straight into this screen or the picture washes out.  We propped a dish towel under the front of the stand in order to have the screen looking up at us ... why no swivel, Viewsonic?  It won't be good for computers for the same reason it doesn't swivel up-or-down.  Analog TV performance is also quite poor, but then we all need to get away from analog anyway.

I should have waited for a review here. The sound is annoying (I found the music setting to be the least annoying for listening to voice). The picture must be viewed at eye level, as also noted in the first review. On a positive note it has all the inputs and outputs you would need.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "JQ", "ReviewID": "R19K59TZQR2BVR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this television for over 2 weeks and I love it; it was the only one that I could find that met my criteria; a QAM tuner, AND it had to sit on my desk and fit under an overhead cabinet in my home office (it made it by 1/16\", whew!)The picture quality is very good, but as other reviewers have said, the viewing angle could be better. I watch it at eye level, straight on, about 3-4 feet away and it is super. If I stand up and walk around, the upper vertical angle lightens the pic, but still looks OK to me. I checked the lower angle and it darkens the display. Of course I wouldn't watch it that way, but if you were to have it on a high shelf, that could be a problem. If you are close to the TV, the Horizontal angle at eye level makes the picture have a negative type appearance when you stray too far to either side. This is similar to a 22\" Vizio we have in the kitchen. Again, it works for me in my situation, but could be a distraction in other environments.Lastly, the sound! Yes, it is not really great; kinda reminds me of a Transistor radio I had in the 50's. I tried to live with it for awhile, but it got on my nerves (I'm rather picky). I did not want to return the TV, so I purchased a pair of inexpensive Logitec 120 speakers, hooked them up to the headphone jack, and I am now very pleased with the sound output. If you demand more, you could spring for more elaborate extension speakers.All in all, I would recommend this with the caveats mentioned above. I'm very happy with it and was well worth the cost! It gets 4 Stars only because of the sound quality!______________________Update: 12/2009I feel I need to downgrade my initial praise of this TV. All I said earlier is true, but after two months it began to develop pixilation and checker boarding on the QAM stations. I at first thought it was my cable company, but the 4 other sets I have with a QAM tuner were fine. I even moved this TV to other inputs and it had the same problem. I returned the TV for repair at my expense and it came back just the same, if not worse.I called ViewSonic again and was sent a replacement TV (probably a refurbished one); they paid and were very nice. It is just the same. I then bought new cables, got a signal booster and had the cable company come and check; still has intermittent problems on the QAM stations. I even went to AV forums to see if there was any clue.So, my thinking is that this TV has an inherent problem with the QAM side of the tuner. It will more then likely work for most folks, but not too well with my cable company. It has a great picture when it works, but when it doesn't, it is very, very annoying. I would put all the blame on the cable company, but as said, my other TVs work great. So, just my opinion-hope it is helpful to some.One last item; the headphone jack on the replacement TV does not power the extension speakers I purchased to overcome the poor sound.

Don't do it, don't buy this one.  The picture is great as long as you are sitting squarely in front of it exactly at eye level.  But if you are buying this for your kitchen or a small room and doing what most people would be doing ... moving around, this is horrible.  The slightest off angle viewing creates a washed out picture.And the sound is worse.  Tinny barely describes it and I haven't found a way to make it really acceptable.Oh, and all this only after waiting through a VERY long start up time where we get to view the three birds!Unless you have one of those very specific stationary uses where the users thought it was ok, move on.

The picture is great, the tuner is great (I don't use a Decoder box so this is key), it's got a HDMI input (I do use an Apple TV so this is key).I used a OmniMount PRO 12\" ceiling mount to place the TV over my fridge in the kitchen, so the standard VESA mounts on the back were also something I needed.  The stand can be removed easily enough with a small screwdriver (I expected ViewSonic to provide a small snap on cover for the hole left behind on the bottom after removing the stand but there wasn't one (at least not in the box I received - this might bother some people.The setup menu's easy enough to deal with, I set it up to skip the duplicate analog channels so when I channel up and down I see the HD channel if it's available.  I tried labeling the channels but can't seem to get the labels to \"stick\".If sound quality is very important to you, I do recommend you purchase a supplementary set of speakers for it.  Like any small TV I've seen it sounds a bit \"tinny\" on it's own.  Thankfully there are plenty of computer speakers available which fit the bill, for example I used an Insignia NS-3006 setup that I picked up for under $50 and am delighted with the setup.  The TV helps out by muting it's own speakers when you use the headphones jack.Hope this helps.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Viewing angle, sound are problems", "Author": "Watchdog", "ReviewID": "R1HOQUO2R90NV7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "With the set on the counter top and looking straight at it while standing, the picture was good but it appeared faded when siting at the table about 12 feet away.

After extensive looking for a 16 x 9 aspect ratio small tv set which I could hang above my kitchen countertop and below the kitchen cabnets, I finally came to the conclusion that this was one of the \"very\" few which there was to choose from.For a lcd tv of this size, it is well endowed with neat features... inputs, such as HDMI, S video, etc.  The cost of this set is relative inexpensive ($176 from Amazon's dealer, \"J&R;\") and it is a nice looking unit.  Oh, did I also say that it is the only set of it's size catagory with the universal  \"VESA\" mounting capability on it's back side.It looks nice, has a great picture, and fits perfect.  So, why not five star rating?  The audio !!  It is simply not very good... in fact, the telephone actually has almost as good a sound quality.  Even setting the tone controls (in the menu), it still sounds like two tin cans with a string.Several other reviews spoke of this, and I must say that now that I own this set, I concur 100%.  If you are listening to voice it isnt \"that bad\", but dont say you were not warned that the sound is poor.  Yes, I'm keeping the set, cause it's a pefect fit with excellent picture, and, well.... I'll get use to the sound -- after all, it's only used when in the kitchen (when there is a football game on, and  you cant afford to miss a play).UPDATE:  COUPLE YEARS LATER  January 18, 2012View Sonics Customer Relations and Technical Service IS BAD.  Turned set on and got \"Set Clock\" screen.  Went to menu and set clock but set still wont allow me to get tv picture (I have sound).  Called tech support -- poor lady only knew to tell me what the instruction book said about settting clock (which I had read already).  Told me \"your set must have a problem\".  When asked about a second line of technical help she said \"she was the final technical authority\".  Called View Sonics Corp Office and was told they would check it for fee of $140  (you can buy them NEW on Amazon for less).

However if you were to the side a little or lower than the screen then the picture sort of disappeared. The sound was not great either. It was very \"tinny\" even after manually adjusting the sound. It might be okay for use as a computer monitor but not as a TV, at least not for what I wanted a TV for. One that I can see from all seats of my round table and from the sink or stove. I am returning it. For $10 more I can get a Panasonic 19\" LCD HDTV with 2 HDMI outputs dnd I tested out the \"view\" in person and its way better than this ViewSonic.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "T.V=OK  Speakers = AWEFULL!!!!", "Author": "Waldo", "ReviewID": "R3JJQ4NFJAN5EU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this for my wife as a kitchen T.V.It works well enough.

Blacks are non-existent, with dark scenes turned into a gray soup.  The poorest off-axis viewing I've ever seen, both horizontal and vertical.  If you buy this set plan on sitting in a fixed spot, dead in front of it.  Also, there's a large power light right under the screen which cannot be dimmed or darkened, and which I found annoying.On the plus side it's a cute little set that fits perfectly in the niche I have for it.

Weller", "ReviewID": "R3W2V2IFPNYVOF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading other's reviews on this TV I was hesitant to purchase one. Boy was I suprised! I primarily use it as a second monitor for my Dell M11X via HDMI. Wow! The picture quality is way better that I expected. I would go so far as to say that it is better than my M11X's display. So much so that I use it as my primary monitor and the M11X's as the secondary. (ok, also because it is larger at 15.5\" vs 11.6\") The stand tilts which is nice since I use it elevated higher than my desk in one place, and on my desk in another. I chose this model in the first place because it is small enough to be portable(fits in my backpack), and it is only one of two in this size range with HDMI. The other one is not widescreen though. I like it so much that I bought two more for use in the other places that I work. (rendering the portability factor moot) I purchased them from an online retailer as refurbished so I paid only [...] each. ([...] shipped) You can't buy a PC monitor for that price. Other reviews complaining about the sound quality are not too far off base, but I would say \"what do you expect from something so small?\". The sound certainly is not a deal breaker for me. As far as the picture quality goes as a TV, that is great too. Especially for HD content. So if you are thinking about buying one of these for use as a second monitor I would definately say go for it, you'll be very satisfied. As a TV I would say yes for a kitchen or nightstand, but not if you have to be more than a few feet away from it.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "comments on ViewSonic 16\" TV", "Author": "Alf \"Alf\"", "ReviewID": "R156KWM26MY0VT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Size and appearance are very nice in a limited space - we use in the kitchen.

The picture is quite good.  I have a 46\" screen downstairs.  It is better, but this one is fine for the distance.  I connected it with HDMI to the cable box.  You will not get as good a picture if you use the other connections.  You can't get around that.  Sound will also be better with HDMI.If you move so you are looking at an off angle you may see some strange pictures.  This TV is not designed for  people looking at odd angles.Unpacking and connecting was very easy.  If you are in a place with a lot of WiFi or there is a cell tower or TV station near by, get a shielded HDMI cable.  They are not expensive these days.Another reason I picked this item was the ability to be used as a PC screen.  I don't expect my screen to drop any time soon, but things happen.If you want to set your cable remote to control the TV, look at the bottom of page 9 in the manual.  I tried following the Cable provider's manual (Comcast) and it failed.
