And the regular LCD TV never satisfy my quality standard; colors are either too cartonish, black is not black, and white is tinted blue. So I have only used plasma as TV. It's warm, have rich real color, it's perfect for movie night, there is no argument there.So for my second TV, which in my study and music room, I want to try something else, since I keep hearing the LED LCD are the bomb nowaday (even most of them still do not look as life like as good plasma to me), the energy usage is low, thin and light. So I try my first LED LCD with this model after researching the latest 2012 models within my \"2nd tv\" price range.Sales person kept pushing LG (got magic wand, apps, thin bezel.....), but for me, IPS is the magic word. For people who do not know what it is just google \"IPS panel\", if no time, just know this, IPS is supposedly the best panel you can get as LCD panel (I believe all big Apple monitors are IPS, no exception), color is more vivid and the view angle should be a perfect 178.Got the baby home, set it up, hook up to my 15TB home server w/ HDMI, play some 1080p clips. Wow, it's so clear and real looking, this is some great monitor/TV I told myself. Flipped to the movies folder, open Avatar, wow, so this is 120hz, looking real smooth, real clear.IN FACT, it's so real and clear, I double check my refresh rate (at 60hz from source) all the codecs. The images looks like a pre-rendered animation, totally flawless. But after the first 5 minutes, it feels kind of weird to me as the movie somehow look much smoother, but \"cheaper\" at the same time. Then I remember the stuff I heard....soap opera effect.I never consider my eyes to be sensitive in any case (if anything, years of looking at multi 27\" monitor should have desensitized me...), so whenever I heard SOE, I'd just brush it off as some people's sensitive eyes. IT'S NOT, it's very much noticeable to anyone, albeit some people just don't care about it when watching movies in the first place. In 300, all the grains are gone! Now it's really looking like animation, watching them fighting the monsters.By now, 2 hours after I unpacked it, I'm panicking and start looking at all the menu items. After much google, some site suggested to use Game mode, so the TV wouldn't add additional frames by itself to smooth out the frames. BINGO, the movies are looking absolutely stunning, got the good colors, no bleeding, black is pretty black (not as black as the best plasma...but blacker than most mid price monitors out there, which is a tall order for this size and price). So I open up some calibration graphic test for monitor and tune it abit, I'm pretty much set -- happy.BTW I have not try any apps in there, but I tested the iphone app remote, works great.So to sum it up, if you just want picture quality with a good price in a LED LCD, not gimmicks like 3D, apps, hair thin bezel, this is it.Make sure you understand the usage of GAME MODE, tune the brightness/contrast/color to watch movie, and use all the other ones for TV, personal videos, then it's good. OTOH, if the SOE do not bother you, doesn't matter then. The color and contrast will win you over in no time.Edit:Thanks to helpful reply, the setting to turn off the SOE is under Advance Picture->Motion Picture Setting. Good stuff.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "All I had hoped for in an LED/LCD", "Author": "StacyK", "ReviewID": "R7NLIOYYODRB8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this from a big box retailer, but have always found the Amazon community to offer great non-pro reviews of mid-level products often skipped by online review sites. Panasonic has picked up the mantle of plasma king since the demise of Pioneer and I hoped the TC-l42E50 would have close to the same impact on LED/LCD market. I have tried LED displays from other major brand names with a 3rd the performance quality of the Panasonic. Let's get this out of the way right now if you are expecting plasma level PQ (picture quality) namely black level performance out of this TV then pack it up and ship it back, because it is not happening. Panasonic has taken the Samsung/Sony approach to this television and offer a screen that pops with intensity, one of the sacrifices being black level performance. You gain a plethora of features that with the right adjustments can make this display outshine it's competitor's. Panasonic has taken great measures to ensure great motion performance with the addition of the 360 backlight scanning feature. This feature breaks the screen into 3 section in which a smart dimming function on the LED's switch them on/off very quickly (120hz frequency) to improve pixel response time and alleviate motion artifacts such as judder, trailing and ghosting/streaking. The math breaks down like this 3 sections x 120hz = 360hz (simulated) for the 360 backlight scanning. They offer an additional motion smoothing technology when set to weak offers no artifacting or Soap Opera Effect (SOE) often seen with this technology, but if gaming on this TV recommend turning off or set to weak due to potential controller lag. Speaking of gaming if you are a gamer than I cannot recommend this TV enough from racing games too first person shooters(FPS)this set can handle anything you can throw at it. I have tried everything from 120hz-480hz televisions and none can perform a third as well as the Panasonic at a about 50% less to the of the main competitors equivalent. Don't let all the fancy jargon confuse you it is all marketing speak. All TV's including plasmas are 60hz with scene interpolation of some kind that inserts frames in between existing frames to give the illusion of a higher refresh rate whether it is Panasonic's:600hz sub-field drive or Samsung's:Auto motion plus they are still a native 60hz. While shopping for a television let that be the last deciding factor, but let your eye's be your guide. Visit a big box store ask for a remote and immediately take it off the Vivid picture settings and set it for Cinema,movie or natural setting in the user menu to get a better idea how the set will function in the real world. This will turn all the post processing nonsense off in most case and let you see the true performance of the display, so you can make an educated decision. If you prefer the look though the Panasonic E50 can still deliver that performance, although adjustments aren't as robust as it's competitor's they are sufficient. Let's break it down. Picture: While not as deep as a plasma display still impressive for an LED/LCD. Black levels are good, but not great colors are natural and accurate making movies and games really pop. Could use a few more adjustment option like a THX or pro mode for better white balance control, but certainly not the worse I have seen. Sound: Like a few of the review have said nothing to write home about, but again not the worse I have heard. If you are in the market for home a theater and gaming set-up most likely a quality surround sound is already a consideration. Since I have a pair of wireless surround sound headphones TV audio quality is not a concern for me. Connectivity: While wi-fi ready this display is not wireless out of the box, an additional dongle is needed for internet connectivity. Build Quality: While this TV doesn't have the paper thin bezel made popular by LG & Samsung it would be right at home on a wall mount or traditional stand. It sports a 1 inch glossy black bezel with a quarter inch clear boarder around that for an all around attractive frame. Panasonic has manage to also avoid some of the pitfalls associated with Edge Lit LED technology namely light bleed and flashlighting. In a completely dark room the screen is solid black or really dark blue through the entirety of the screen with no areas of backlight bleed on any of the sides. There is also no pooling of light where the LED's are unable to reach certain areas of the screen. I have seen $4000.00+ LED TV's not be able to achieve this feat, so very impressive. I hope I was able to give an overall impression of the Panasonic TC-L42E50 television.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything not great, more problems...", "Author": "Kevin Farrell", "ReviewID": "R1ROTXIJTM8EBE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV purchase. I waited a long time for them to come down in price, and am very happy with this TV so far. I've had it for about 3 weeks now and it is working great. I've watched various movies, the Euro Cup games, MLB All-star game, etc. As many have pointed out, it has a great picture, but may need some tweeking to get it how you want. This isn't hard to do if you have basic technology skills (i.e. finding the \"Menu\" button on remote and going to \"Picture,\" then playing around with settings). Again, as others have noted, sound is okay. I'm not an audiophile or anything, but like good audio. I'll probably get a sound bar at some point, but it's just fine for now. I would not let others criticism of the sound deter you from buying this TV. I have not used the internet ready features, but will once I get a wifi blue ray player hooked up so can't comment there.The biggest issue with the TV is what others have noted - Panasonic's shoddy packaging. This really surprises me considering the quality of TV. Spend a few more pennies to get an extra layer of card board in there! My box had several holes punched right through it (thanks Fed Ex), fortunately they were all in the back which had more room for error (extra inch or two of depth) than if it were in front where the screen was. If the holes were in the front, whatever punched through the box probably would've damaged the screen.To summarize - excellent TV that I'm very happy about. Great price, especially with no tax and free shipping. I got the TV, the Mediabridge HDMI cable, and a 3 year warranty for less than what I would have paid for just the TV at a local big box store before tax! Not sure how Amazon does it, but I'm happy to benefit from their methods. The only thing here is you are rolling the dice having such a large item shipped. Be home when it arrives, inspect the box, give it a whirl. If it doesn't work or has damage then send it back. From the feedback I've read, Amazaon is very good about this. Fortunately I did not have to deal with it. I did take pictures of the damaged box though as a precaution.I'll update this in the future if anything changes, but otherwise am very happy! Wait for it to go on sale and Prime it!8/2/12 UPDATE - I've begun to notice vertical banding - vertical, translucent lines that almost look like shadows, and range in width from 1\" to 4\" across the entire screen. This is PARTICULARLY noticeable when I have been watching olympic soccer or baseball games with the green background when the camera is panning or following the action quickly. You see it at other times when there is a bright background and the camera is moving. I've also noted when objects move quickly in movies or shows there is some serious distortion. Other 95% of time picture is great. It is not an HDMI cable or input issue. This is a 120hz TV, so it should not be a refresh rate issue IMO. Here are some links on the topic as it appears to be a common problem w/ LCD and LED tv's.[...][...]Unfortunately, I'm past my 30 days to return it to Amazon. I bought the Square Trade warranty and talked to them first. They were very friendly and helpful, recommending that I use the Panasonice warranty and if they denied me to call back as they would service it. Initially Panasonic DENIED my claim for warranty service as their customer service determined it was not a \"serviceable issue.\" They gave me information on how to dispute the decision. I ultimately asked for a supervisor, who cleared it to be serviced w/o me even talking to them. Technician is coming to my house next week and I look forward to seeing what he says b/c according to the links above it may just be a chronic problem LED/LCD tv's. Even if the tech says it is working properly, I'm still pretty happy with this tv. Panasonic's customer service is more up in the air at this point. I'd love to hear if anyone else has seen this problem with this TV?I'll post again once I get it serviced and update this again...8/7/12 UPDATE - I see they wouldn't allow me to include my links from my last update...oh well. So the technician came to my house today and noticed the problem right away. I guess that does make it a \"serviceable issue.\" We enjoyed watching some of the Brazil and S. Korea match for a while. He tried a few things. We reproduced it on other channels and on a DVD. He said it's not the panel or backlight as he put it to a blue screen and everything was perfect. His best guess was something is wrong with the refresh rate for whatever reason, and noted that since it is a 120hz TV it should not be happening. He said he has not seen this particular issue before, and it looked comparable to what most 60hz TV's look like. He called it in and described it as a \"noisy background.\" The person on the other end of the phone tended to agree so they are replacing the \"main board\" on the TV. On the receipt it is noted as a \"Main PCB,\" and is a $262 repair. The part is being delivered to my house and repair scheduled for next week. I'll continue to update as it happens.8/16/12 UPDATE - Same tech came back today and replaced the main board. This did not solve the problem. He tried adjusting settings, called into his office to talk to technician who is particularly knowledgeable about settings and calibration, still no luck. He did say that issues like this are not uncommon in LCD/LED TV's. Next step is to call Panasonic and see what they say. Problems seems undetectable to some, others notice it immediately.9/23/12 UPDATE - Wow. Where do I begin. I'll start out with this - Panasonic's customer service is an epic nightmare. That's a pretty good summary. I'm now a month and a half into dealing with them. I've made 5-6 calls to them since my last post in August, spent hours in discussion with them, hours on hold, hours being disconnected, hours being re-routed to the wrong people and the wrong department. In a word, incompetent would be putting it nicely. The service company who came out to service the TV declared it non-repairable back in August. Panasonic claimed they never did this. And around and around we go. There are so many stories I don't even know where to begin. On one call I was told that I could not speak to a supervisor and that I could not leave a message for one. End of phone call. Seriously. It's just insane. This past Friday I spent over an hour with them on the phone as they told me my \"TV was working to specifications and would not be replaced.\" It really took them over a month to determine this? When I asked for a full clarifcation as to why, again, they are cherry picking information from the repair company. The TV is working to specs, however, it also still has the screen issue and they have no idea how to fix it. This is clearly noted in the report. I was told I would need to call the repair company as they would not replace the TV unless the repair company changed their report. I called them (A&E; Repair) and they were responsive, friendly, and competent. What a change. We now have an appointment for the same tech to come to my home on Wed. to verify the problem is still occurring (which it is). Then we are going to call Panasonic together and tell them the TV needs to be replaced. A&E; said this way Panasonic cannot claim that the TV was never called in as unrepairable, again.At this point Panasonic is at least guilty of incompetence in their customer service and warranty department. At worst, they are disingenuous, lying, and not standing by their product in an attempt to get me to give up my attempts at getting a working product. What they have yet to learn is that I'm pretty persistent and they've chosen the wrong customer to do this to. I've yet to decide if I will report them to the Better Business Bureau yet. That will depend on the outcome of my experience on Wed. Regardless, I will continue to update this post, my post on CNET forum, I plan to write a personal letter to Panasonic Corporate, and publish a lengthy post to their public Facebook page. That will be a start. To all others who are having the same problem from Panasonic (many of you have contacted me personally), I suggest you document everything - the dates, times, names and ID #'s of all employees in every interaction you have with them. Demand a supervisor as they are slightly more competent than the typical person who answers. And good luck, because you will need it. I will update again as this develops.10/6/2012: I've now dropped my rating of this product to 2 stars. The TV has begun to have serious backlite bleed through - blotchy and ligther in some spots than others when on a black screen - especially in the corners. For the type of LED TV this is, my understanding is that this shouldn't be happening. I wish I could attach pictures. Maybe a video review is in my future to prove all of this. The original banding issue is still occurring. It's also down to 2 because of the overall terrible customer service - unexcusable.Anyway, the technician never came to my house. He was in contact with Panasonic techs who told him that this problem is \"normal.\" They even asked the warranty technician why he was still in contact with me and that he shouldn't be speaking with me anymore since the case is closed. They basically told the one person trying to help me to stop talking to me. Can you believe this?! I've never experienced anything quite like this. I actually spoke to someone at Panasonic that seemed to know what they were talking about in customer service and it's as simple as this - unless I can get someone to claim the TV as unrepairable, there is nothing customer service can do. Since my TV is \"working to specs\" and the problems people have actually acknowledged exist are \"normal,\" nothing is going to happen. My last ditch effort is an email to the Panasonic technician dept. he was speaking to, along with attached photos and videos of the problem. As always, I'll post their response.This review has become a book and is silly by now, but for me it's the principle of the matter at this point. I'm glad to see the time I've taken to write this has actually deterred people from buying this product. Hopefully more of you continue to comment.10/31/12:Happy Halloween. No trick here, I'm actually getting my TV replaced. So I was able to take video and photo proof of the problems on the TV. I emailed it to Panasonic at the address they requested and surprise, surprise, no response after 2 weeks. I then filed a Better Business Bureau case and had a call from the North American branch of Panasonic within 48 hours. The employee that called me was friendly, professional, and re-assured me right out of the gate that my TV will either be replaced or my money back - my choice. I was informed however, that my current one could not be repaired. I asked them how that could be when they were willing to replace it, but yet other staff had told me it was \"working to specs.\" This is no lie now - I was actually asked if I was recording the conversation. I reassured them I was not. I was then told that it is known internally that there are problems with Panasonic LED line of televisions. REDEMPTION!The employee said that they could not repair the issue because techinically it was within their accepted specs, and that they could not comfortably replace it with the same model as it would be likely that the replacement would have the same issues. In talking to a friend who works at out local Best Buy, he told me that they had not received any Panasonic LED shipments in a while and his guess was maybe they are actually doing something about this now.Anyway, I was offered a full refund, or an upgrade to a Panasonic plasma TV that was much nicer, larger, and a lot more features. I took the TV and I talked them into giving me the next model up from what they offered me an even exchange for due to my troubles. Basically I'm getting a $1200 TV for my orginal price of $750. My Square Trade Warranty also transfers over. I have the employee's direct line so I will be dealing only with them for any future issues - another reason I was willing to take another Panasonic. I'm waiting for the TV to be delivered to a local business who will be delivering it to my door and taking away the \"old\" one. Hopefully I'll only be writing one more review after this professing love for my new TV. If you are having the same problems that I had, save yourself a lot of stress and wasted time and just open up the BBB case if Panasonic is dragging their feet.I win...maybe11/30/2012:I've had the replacement for almost 2 weeks now (got delayed due to demand and Hurricane Sandy...seems right for my luck in all this). I talked them into giving me a TC-P50ST50 plasma unit as an even exchance. A regional repair company sent a technician out to pick up the old one and set-up the new one. The replacement TV they gave me is absolutely stellar. The plasma picture is far superior to the LED I had. The sound is also much better. It truly is a pretty spectacular TV. Unfortunately, the stock Netflix app is not working on it. Fortunately I do not have to go through Panasonic anymore. The repair technician from the delivery company is in direct contact with their tech dept and is handing it. Panasonic tried to say it was b/c I have too low bandwith - something I thought was plausible considering I only get 3mbps to my house. So I had my cable company bump me up to 15mbps (plenty of bandwith for the app) for a day to see what would happen. I verified via a speed test that I was up and running at 15mbps. It did not solve the problem. I think the app was corrupted on install or something. The technician is awaiting a response from Panasonic at this time. The fun continues...1/10/2013:The Netflix issue was resolved without repair, but rather by some help from the Amazon community. It actual was likely happening due to Comcast intentionally restricting bandwith to the TV (apparently something they readily admit they do to other on-demand competitors). Once I changed the IP address on the TV to the public Google server, the app has worked just fine since then. The replacement plasma TV I received is fantastic. I'm very happy with it.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Far, So Good!", "Author": "BG0310", "ReviewID": "R26UCPU43QDKPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this TV up earlier this month to take the place of a disappointing LED set from another brand, and I couldn't be happier that I made the switch. This Panasonic model is the sharpest I've ever had and a few quick adjustments to the picture settings were all I needed to ensure a consistently solid (if not better) picture. In a TV, I wanted something that would be especially reliable when it came to sports, but also worked well with movies and other everyday programming plus the occasional video game session, and this TV has certainly delivered on all counts. I'm able to see the picture clearly from just about every angle imaginable, with no blurring and only a negligible amount of artifacts.I didn't set out to buy a TV equipped with Internet capability, but it's definitely a nice feature to have. The setup in the room is such that I don't need the wireless capability and the added expense of an adapter, because I'm able to simply connect an ethernet cable to my router from the TV and I'm good to go. So far, I haven't had any connectivity problems or real lag. While all the subscription services included in the Viera Cast have their own advantages and uses, the Twitter software is what may give me the most utility. I'm still trying to figure out how to tweet efficiently, but that's secondary to following my feed by the hashtag of whatever event or show I'm watching. I've tried out a few Netflix movies to test the functionality and didn't experience any problems. It includes a pretty simple interface, even for beginners.Setting up the TV was very easy, and I especially like that there's a fitting that the TV slides onto while you secure it to the base with the included screws.4 HDMI ports may be a little much for some people, especially if the VieraCast software takes the place of a Roku or other streaming media device, but it's nice to know that I have ports to spare in case I end up needing them later. I'd much rather have extras than find myself switching out a device every time I want to use something different. The stock speakers are just fine (no tinny sound, as can be the case with other LED TV's, including the one I had before this one), but if you're an audiophile, I wouldn't blame you for hooking up something a little nicer, be it a soundbar or a multichannel surround system.While I didn't pick it up on Amazon, the price was in the same neighborhood as it was new on Amazon and its affiliated retailers - a great buy for an LED TV with streaming media capability from one of the best brands out there. As for the 42\" size, it's ideal if you want something substantial but still small enough that it won't dominate the room if you don't want it to.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Nice, Budget, Smart TV", "Author": "Jingleballs", "ReviewID": "R1VPLVJBUDJQZO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I usually prefer plasma for the quality, but since I needed a TV for a bright room, I took a chance on this LED and glad I did.  I also considered the Samsung LN46D630, but can't stand the ugly \"touch of color\" bronze strip on the TV.The picture quality of the Panasonic is nice with some tweaking.  The blacks aren't super dark, unless you turn on a black level filter, but that makes the picture too dark and blackens any shadow detail.  (I wish there were a setting in between high and low for blacks, but you can keep it on low and tweak the other picture settings for decent black with some shadow detail.)  I didn't notice the wide viewing angle touted by IPS technology.  I guess I'm just used to plasma and not having that problem.  I did notice some brightness or light leaking around the bottom left edges of the set.  I also noticed 2 blown/dead pixels on the screen, which I can live with since I can't see them from the sofa.  I was a little concerned about the  \"soap opera effect\" but that can be eliminated by turning off the motion settings in the advanced menu.  The screen is not very reflective.  It is a little more reflective than the Samsung LN46D630, when I saw it at Best Buy, but not as bad as the plasma displays.  It looks great in a bright room, and the reflections aren't an issue.4 HDMI inputs is pretty generous for a TV at this price point.  It has an optical audio output, but I wish it also had RCA audio outputs so I could use it with an older amp.  I couldn't find a way to turn off the red power light at the bottom of the TV frame.  I find that distracting, so I might have to put tape over it.If you can connect the TV to an Ethernet port, the web enabled apps are a bonus.  (I don't know why other smart TVs charge a premium for this when they are readily available in cheap blu-ray players.)  I did notice a few black frames appearing occasionally while watching Netflix (I think others have reported this problem too).  Other apps: Pandora, YouTube, Facebook, Skype, etc.I like that you can insert an SD card to watch photos and videos.  (I don't know why other TV makers don't add this.)  There's also a Viera remote app for iOS and android that allow you to stream photos and videos from your phone to the TV.

Wolf \"Goyescas\"", "ReviewID": "RZRFBYC0IRZXW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally decided to upgrade from a bulky and heavy 27\" Panasonic CRT TV in my smallish den (11x13x8); I spent three days researching and comparing models, rejecting 3D outright (can't stand it). Since the light in that room can go from rather bright to almost dark, I opted for an LCD with LED backlighting over Plasma (which is what I would have chosen if I had a need for a larger monitor and a \"home theatre\" type of room to put it in). I computed the requisite distance I would need for the room to be optimum at 39\"s. One poster in my travels indicated that you should ideally go slightly larger: get the TV home, and wait a week and then see if you think his advice good. I remembered that advice and when I got this 42\" home it at first seemed a tad large. A few days later and voila - perfect for viewing 11-12' away. YMMV.I selected this Panny over costlier models from Samsung and LG after comparing the features. I had read that Panny is the way to go \"if you really want accurate flesh tones.\" The most recent advice from the experts (C-NET for ex.) is get 4 HDMI inputs (check); 4 or more adjustable \"settings\" for the picture including an automatic (but defeatable) adjustment for changes in the ambinet lighting (check!); 1080p resolution (check); a 120 Hz Refresh Rate (check + an enhancement as well); USB and Component (check); \"Smart\" feature for internet via ethernet or wireless (check: Viera Smart and Wireless READY).I used the Disney WoW Calibration (Blu Ray) DVD and found that the ideal for late night viewing (i.e., completely controlled ambient lighting) was very close to the calibrations I had made without the DVD. Still, do get this calibration disk, it's worth every penny, and is very easy to understand and use - every action is explained to you prior to the instructions on how to accomplish each setting.I have been using this TV for over a month now and I simply love it. Do get to know how to operate all of the Menu Settings for the picture, but I like to turn off all the enhancements, set it to \"Normal\" (not \"Warm\" or \"Cool\") and focus on the big 5:1. Black Level, found on the Brightness control2. White Level, called Contrast3. Sharpness4. Color Saturation labeled Color5. Color TintTHEN, I try the enhancements and decide from there. ALL of the settings can be altered and memorized or easily re-set to the default (they are: Standard, Cinema, Vivid, Game and Custom).There are a number of apps (and an internet button on the remote to take you there), including NetFlix, YouTube, and Skype. (DNLA is also available on this TV, but I have not looked into that; there is also USB and a SmartCard for displaying photos).The only complaint I have is that on occassion the image will blur when the movement is super fast, for example a woman's hair in an animated film. I have gotten used to seeing this, but it is still distracting at times. I'm told it will happen on occassion with most if not all LCD/LED's. Rare, sure, but worth a mention.To complement this choice I picked-up the latest Panasonic Blu Ray Player which also has ethernet into my wireles router, and of course HDMI straight into the TV. It's the xxx320, with the keyless remote some hate (I love it, you just have to spend some time learning how to use it).

I wanted an LED TV because I like the brightness of it compared to other LCD or plasma. I didn't want a 3D TV and I spent a lot of time looking for a TV without 3D. I don't want to pay extra for it and I won't lay around in my bed with 3D glasses watching a movie so I don't see the point. I did want an internet capable TV to stream Netflix movies. I previously streamed them through my Wii. This TV does not have built in wireless, but I bought a Netgear XAVB5004 Powerline Network Adapter and it works beautifully. I plugged my wireless router into the adapter and I have four ports to hook up an ethernet cable. I think I get better streaming performance this way. I have watched Netflix almost every day and never had a problem. The picture is beautiful. I found that I go back and forth between the picture settings from standard to vivid to a custom setting depending on the time of day and how much light is in the room. It's a nice feature. I have an HD cable box and all the channels display great. I love the extra apps as well. I was considering getting a Google TV but all I thought all I really wanted was the Netflix stream. I am finding that the twitter app is a lot of fun as well. I love watching the Sunday new programs or PBS special using the hashtag for the show and seeing all the comments others make. It is a truly integrated experience, and better then looking at twitter on my tablet while watching TV.Since I loved having such a great picture, I also upgraded and got the Panasonic DMP-BDT220 Integrated Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Player for watching movies. This blue ray player does have wireless, but I plugged in the ethernet cable anyways since I had it setup. I tested Netflix and other apps through the blueray player as well but I probably won't use those features since I have them on the TV. The sound is a bit low when I play movies, but I don't think that is due to the TV. I am thinking of getting a soundbar to enhance the audio.Overall, I love this TV!

Thomas", "ReviewID": "RTDU2AMZG48JN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I started my HDTV buying journey a little over a month ago.  The first model I bought was a Panasonic TC-L42E5, which in retrospect was a fine TV.  It was my mistake to order something too small for my room, so I returned it in favor of its bigger brother, the TC-L47E50.When the box arrived at my doorstep, everything looked fine upon first inspection.  The cardboard was in good shape and all the styrofoam blocks inside were right where they should be.  Still, I was surprised at how little structure the flimsy box provided.I thought the TV looked great once I had it set up in my room.  Panasonic's styling is pretty nice and understated.  I also liked the rear metal panel of the TV.  It conveyed quality.But when I turned it on for the first time, I immediately noticed a light bleed pattern around the center of the screen, which was only visible with the backlight on in a dark scene.  It's worth noting that the 42\" E5 model that I returned prior to receiving the 47\" E50 did not exhibit this problem at all, so I was very disappointed to see it.I owned the TV for a week before deciding to return it.  I really wanted to like this particular TV, but there were a few other flaws in addition to the light bleed.One of the flaws had to do with some minor banding.  There were two faint 2\" wide vertical bars on either side of the screen that appeared a bit darker than the rest of the scene.  These were visible on solid-color backgrounds, and they were noticeable during certain panning shots as well.Another flaw (not a deal breaker in itself) was the whole Viera Connect experience.  I found the user experience to be extremely slow and clunky.  The Netflix and Pandora apps worked well enough, but nothing else was useful for me.  Pulling up the UI could be painful as well.  If I tried to launch Viera Connect within the first minute or two of the TV turning on, I'd get a \"No network connection could be found - retry?\" error that didn't like being told to \"retry.\"Also, why does Panasonic include things that resemble banner advertisements in the Smart TV experience?  Sure, the startup \"Viera Connect\" banner can be turned off, and maybe the ad spot in the upper-right corner of Viera Connect won't get in your way, but I found both of these to be pretty tacky.But the biggest quirk was when I noticed that the light bleed pattern could be manipulated around the screen by applying gentle pressure with a microfiber cloth.  After I wiped some smudges off the screen, I noticed that the light bleed pattern looked totally different.  Then I realized I could move around the light/dark areas sort of like pressing bubbles around between two pieces of thin film.  Yikes.  This is when I decided to return the TV.Afterwards, to make matters even worse, I noticed that there was a 3-4 inch long creased dent on the rear panel.  It was right in the top/center area and ran vertically.  It's almost as if the entire TV was bent or bowed during shipping.  I can't be totally sure if this was the reason for all the screen defects, but it obviously wasn't a good sign.I've noticed that other reviewers and commentators here have experienced similar problems with the OEM box that the TV ships in.

And, before I bought this TV 12 days ago, I read every comment. I will try not repeat what has already been written before. The picture quality is amazing for a TV priced at $600.00.  Ok, it does not match the picture of my 52\" Sony, which cost over $3,000.00.  Sufficient it to say that the picture quality of this Panasonic is 95% as good as my Sony.I have a digital archive of more than 10,000 photos, some taken yesterday and some taken 100 years ago.  All of them have been digitalized in the highest resolution possible.  I have downloaded some of my photo folders onto a SanDisk 32 GB flash memory drive ($20) for use in my Asus tablet \"computer\".I took the flash drive and inserted into my Panasonic.  I set up the search for folders and began to review my images on this 42\" screen.  You will be blown away.  If you like what you saw on your computer screen or paper photo printouts, you will realize immediately how much you have been missing. Viewing your images in the \"cinema\" mode will brighten the picture considerably.There are comments about bad packaging quality.  My box arrived undefiled - not a mar on the package.  The guts of the box were well reinforced and protected.  Ok, if someone jams a crowbar into the box, you will receive a broken tv.  I refused to pay an extra $30 for expedited delivery.  My box floated around the \"nether\" (warehouses and carriers of UPS) for at least 7 days. Why pay 5% more to get it in 2 days.In summary, I received an outstanding tv.  This is not a computer - not an interface to the internet - not an editing machine - this is just a great tv - a viewing machine.

I ended up with 25 for sharpness - something no one else mentioned.  Turn it to High for Motion Setting in Advanced Picture Menu for the football games - I saw no blur - turn it to low or off for everything else.  Use Warm for the color setting it looks the most natural.  No light is the best way to watch this TV.  Pause a video on some clouds or a dark scene to do your adjustments, that is the most important adjustment you will make, I found that you need to turn the brightness up to see darker scenes.2. Get 2 25 foot cables, an HDMI and an Ethernet to run from your gaming PC and your Router if in the other room, your bluetooth keyboard and wireless mouse can still work, just pick them up and carry them into the tv room so you can play Diablo III, Starcraft, League or Legends etc.3. Download Serviio, add your PCs picture, music and video files.  It plays everything so far including 1080p MKV perfectly - it will show up automatically in the Viera Tools DNA menu choice, then browse by folder to see your stuff and play it - it is free, I use it for videos - negates having to get a Western Digital to stream your mkv and other file types4. On the Panasonic Apps download Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Pandora, and Picasa.  Pandora is nice for using your surround sound system to play music, if hooked up to a hifi receiver and speakers.  Use your PC or a laptop via HDMI if you need to do Spotify or iTunes.5. Get the Wii HDMI adapter cable adapter to get the best picture for Mario games6. Next steps for me, get something that streams Spotify and can mirror my iPad so probably will end up getting Apple TV and Roku unless Apple adds Spotify.  For now will use PC with HDMI to do Spotify.7. When you hook up your TV HDMI you might have to change the HD View under Zoom Options from 1 to 2 in order to see the whole desktop.  My Envy Laptop needed HD 1, my Desktop Gaming needed HD 2.8. You can't adjust the black level from light to dark unless you are using an HDMI, the on line and TV itself gray it out, HDMI on my DVD player lets you change that to dark9. You will be annoyed about having no analog audio outputs; however, if you have a receiver and some good speakers you will enjoy those more during movies.  Don't buy a $50 Dolby Decoder box; get a receiver and use the headphone jack on that to plug in your analog stuff such as good PC speakers or Wireless Headphones, much better DAC and sounds will play that way.10. Ikea has by far the best TV stands for this TV, I got a low rise black one that was easy to build and has three cubby holes and a little shelf above each and 8 3 inch tall feet to hide all my cables under, they have plenty to choose under $100.

Swaney \"Swanepop\"", "ReviewID": "R1OX8LZNVAZ6BE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the Panasonic LCD TV last week and have been very impressed by its quality and ease of set-up. I am using it with a FIOS system and my only problem was that when I tried to use the 5-lead component adapter that came with the TV to connect to my combined cable box/DVR, the picture came through in black-and-white. Panasonic telephone service was sympathetic and suggested I use the HDMI connection instead to see if the adapter was defective. I subsequently bought an HDMI cable and it has worked perfectly ever since. I then tried the adapter to connect our Wii system (using only 3 of the 5 leads) and that worked fine, so I'm unsure whether the adapter that came with the TV is defective or not. I suggest that you spring for an HDMI cable (they're cheap - about $7-10) at the time of your TV purchase to save potential frustration.I also ordered the TY-WL20U Wi-Fi receiver in order to take advantage of the built-in wi-fi capability and to make sure all aspects of the TV worked correctly even if I don't have much current need for wi-fi connectibility (but I'm assuming this will develop into a more important feature as time goes on). That, also, connected very easily and would allow us to stream from Netflix, for example (if we subscribed) through Viera Tools. It did allow an immediate software update from the Internet, which I assume is a good thing and future updates will now be possible as Panasonic expands its Internet repertoire. I downloaded the Panasonic Viera App for my iPad, more out of curiosity than anything as I don't yet see a need, and found it to be a bit flaky. Perhaps with upgrades it will become a more reliable modality for controlling the TV (and providing a more useful keyboard for such entry).As a TV it functions great and works well with our DVR. I discovered I could add 50 channels of HD service at no additional cost so we can enjoy all the usual channels we used to watch in standard def in HD now. Some officienados might obsess over depth of blacks and so forth, but the settings are so extensive that I don't think any normal person would have a  problem with this (or most any) TV. I easily programmed my Verizon FIOS remote to control the most-used functions we need (code 0277, I think), and only use the Panasonic remote for calling up Viera or Internet (or to change aspect ratio, for example, if we ever choose to do that).One feature I hadn't anticipated that will be nice is that I took a spare flash drive and loaded all of our best photos onto it and plugged it into the 1 remaining USB port (the wi-fi adapter takes the first of 2). Now through Viera I can use the TV as a big-screen picture frame in a slideshow. It lacks the motion detector to turn the power on and off when someone is in the room, so I don't want the electricity cost of leaving it going continuously, but it will be nice when friends or family come over to reminisce over favorite pictures.One thing I would like to do, but haven't figured out whether it's possible without directly connecting my computer to the TV through a cable, is to wirelessly use the TV as a monitor to show a PowerPoint, for example, on the TV. Perhaps that's asking too much, but it seems theoretically possible. Sometime I will call Panasonic and ask.Overall, this was a great purchase and I am very satisfied.

My concern was picture quality, price and screen glare.Even being a tech person, I had to contact my son before buying.  His words to me were \"Dad, you don't need 3D - you won't watch it - and you probably won't use wi-fi.\"  He was right!Pros:1. Sturdy stand, great picture, Panasonic quality and reliability. I had a tube Panasonic for 20 years and finally gave it to Goodwill.  The tv and the remote were still working!  My 32 inch Panasonic LCD is a great tv and still going strong.  It does have the annoying habit of occasionally needing to be powered off and on when it gets the blinking red light.2. No motion problems, backlight bleeding or uniformity problems observed (I'm not too picky about these!)Cons:1.  A slightly larger bezel than needed, but still reasonably trim.  Looks better than I thought it would.  (My tv is not wall mounted.)2.  There is some screen glare, but it is not a deal breaker.  It is more an occasional annoyance, but an annoyance just the same.  I would rather have a matte finish as I don't need the colors to \"pop\".  I just want them to be accurate.  I considered a plasma, but I like the LED brightness and color a little bit more.  Plasma would have been a truer picture in terms of overall color and would have avoided any motion issues, but I noticed a bit more glare with the plasmas than the LED I purchased.  Please be aware that there are reflection/glare issues from room lights such as lamps with this LED TV for darker scenes but it could be a real issue to you if there are bright windows that are directly in line with the tv (behind the viewer or at the appropriate angle when viewing from the side) so that it reflects in the panel.  I set up the room to have the tv on the same side as the windows and I either use a lamp behind the tv or off to the side.Other comments:1.  The remote is the standard Panasonic remote.  Nothing spectacular but it works for me. Only controls the tv.2.  Picture is very good.  My wife commented on how good the colors are, especially the natural color of faces.3.  Like others have said, I believe that this is a LG panel.  It has a very good viewing angle in my opinion at least on the horizontal(side to side) viewing.  I have not looked at the tv from a chair to higher on the wall since the tv is not wall mounted.  However from the floor to the tv at about 30 inches, it looks fine.4.  I connect to my network via powerline adapters.  Works great!  If I want wi-fi, I can get a WD Live TV Streaming Media box or a Roku.5.  Speakers are adequate, but not great.  This is on par for thin tv's, we just need to learn to live with it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I played music from my LG NAS via DLNA and it sounded really good through the tv speakers! Much better than I would have expected given the sound that comes out for normal tv viewing.6.  I really miss analog audio outputs!  It is a waste of a great receiver and IMO a waste of money to have to purchase another receiver just to hook the tv to the receiver with the digital only outputs.7.  If you are thinking of whether to get a 42 inch or a 47 inch tv, my advice is to measure what kind of stand you are going to put it on.  I have some vintage (30 year old) Kenwood speakers that are a little too big to put beside most stands and most tv stands are a little too short lengthwise to hold the tv and my JBL bookshelf speakers.  TV is about 43 inches wide and the speakers take up about 9 inches each, so they don't quite fit on a standard 56 to 60 inch entertainment center. (I see a pair of floorstanding Polk speakers in my future!)  I don't regret getting a 47 inch tv (love seeing more details in movies, sports etc).  However, I could have easily lived with a 42 inch tv. If you are wall-mounting the tv, bigger is probably better.8.  I bought the tv a while back when they were still being shipped in the single layer carton.  It survived the trip with no damage, but the remote was falling out of the bottom of the box, the styrofoam had been popped on one side and the box looked like it had been through a war zone.  It may be worth it to spend a few bucks to get one-day shipping if you already have a Prime account!Anyone who wants a good tv at a reasonable price will probably be very happy with this tv.  No bells or whistles, just reasonable quality and value.  I paid $849 for the tv and got a $100 credit as an Amazon promotion.  There have been promotions that included a Blu-ray player also. The price will go a bit lower as the sale season gets here.  I considered the LG 47LM7600, Samsung UN46ES6XXX models and also the Panasonic TC-47ET5.  I decided that in a couple of years, I might want to upgrade, so for now, this model made a lot of sense.  I may be wrong, but I think 3D TV is a just a trend for right now and really isn't much more than a novelty.  It's a nice perk if it comes with the set you want.  Usually it is included on the higher end models as part of the added features and premium panel which you may or may not need.  Thanks to all the reviewers here and in the other tv reviews who helped me to make a good decision in purchasing my tv!23 Sep 2012 Update:You may want to consider the Samsung UN46EH6000 for a very basic LED TV with a matte screen.  It also has an analog audio out.  However, you do not get an ethernet port.  The tv gets good reviews from consumers, but the professional reviews are critical of it for picture quality and only having 2 hdmi ports.  Consumers seem to really like it.  It may work for you if reflections from windows or lamps are an issue.I bought a Sunny Designs real wood (birch) 42 inch tv stand for $169 dollars (about $180 with tax) at a local brick and mortar store.  It is all wood except for the bottom of the stand which is a high quality engineered wood and not visible.  The top, sides, and shelves are all real wood.  The finish is the weakest point, but at this price, it was well worth it.  It is light, sturdy, and reasonably easy to assemble.  I recommend you consider it if you want a wood stand.  It comes in a variety of finishes and in sizes 42\", 52\" and 60\".", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value and Picture ...

It was between this model and one by Samsung and another by LG.  I was looking to upgrade to a 42\" model that can fit in my TV cabinet (I had 26\" of height clearance, and this TV just fits perfectly).3D was not a requirement and to be honest, I still find 3D technology a little too premature.  Regardless of active/passive/etc, I still find 3D to cause eye strain.  Having a panel with a high refresh rate was important though, and this display has 120Hz (I know many TVs have 240Hz, but they tend to come with a price).  The TV takes refresh rates a step further with the motion blur adjustments in the advanced picture settings ... which is rather interesting.  On cable TV content, I found it to make the picture a little too fake.  It almost made video quality look a bit amateur and video panning to seem long and drawn out.  It even felt like frames skipped occasionally.  However, when watching a blu-ray (from our PS3), this setting made the picture feel as if we were right there on the set watching the movie get filmed.  It had a real cinematic quality to it that almost justifies never going to the movies again.... so, I suggest turning off the motion picture setting when watching regular TV content and keeping it on for movies.I have several components hooked up to the TV all with HDMI.  The TV is connected to my audio receiver via TOSLink using the optical audio out on the rear of the TV.  I was originally planning on getting an HDMI switch along with a splitter that could split the audio signal off to my receiver.  My receiver does not support HDMI.

Every TV manufacturer today is missing a bet by not offering at least a separate sub-woofer to plug directly into the set, rather than having all kinds of 'bass boost' and 'surround sound' audio features which do next to nothing for the sound.Regarding Netflix: I almost wish I could pull just half a star, and would have pulled a full star if I didn't find a viable workaround to the problem I encountered. This Panasonic VIERA set has the same Netflix problem that I found mentioned repeatedly on the Internet. The default behavior loads Netflix videos just fine and I can watch shows, but they flicker to black for a second every minute or two. The video continues uninterrupted, but the flickering is very distracting. Finally, what I did was to go to the Netflix website and manually dial down my streaming rate from 'automatic' to 'better' (middle setting). Actually, I think I prefer this level of quality anyway, if only to keep my ISP from complaining about my bandwidth consumption. It looks fine, and after watching House of Cards for about 20 minutes, I'd say it probably solves the black flicker problem. At least I hope so.What I found in my research is this seems to be a buffering problem that is primarily due to Netflix's servers. However, I have a Sony Blu-ray player with Netflix built in, and it always worked fine. Therefore whatever this technical problem is, it's solvable at the hardware/software level, and unfortunately the Panasonic folks haven't managed to nail it. For what it's worth, my Amazon Prime streaming videos looked terrific and didn't flicker or have any problems at all. So there, I'm guessing that Amazon's streaming app does a better job of buffering.I noticed one negative review here mentioned shoddy shipping packaging. Well, I'm guessing that Amazon must have listened to the feedback, because the packaging used for my shipment was outstanding. It was a large box (with lots of 'fragile', 'screen front' and 'do not lay on side' labeling). Inside was a very strong cardboard spacer in the bottom, the sides completely filled with some newfangled folded triangular cardstock-style packing material (obviously recyclable, but we're saving them to use as kindling for our wood-stove this winter), and more strong spacers on either end and on top. In the middle of all this was the original TV packing box. I don't think they could've made it any safer.Pro Tips:- Use advanced picture settings or Game mode to disable that awful 'Motion Flow' feature (it's what makes everything look like Soap Opera video). Even a reduced amount looks better than when it's set to 'Strong'- Many THX blu-ray movie discs have picture adjustment tools; they're seriously worth using.- Turn off the C.A.T.S. feature, which adjusts brightness and gradation according to the room's ambient lighting. I actually thought there was something wrong with the set because I couldn't get the brightness to look right, and it kept changing.- Menu --> Picture --> (scroll to 2nd page) --> Advanced Picture = Is where you can turn off Motion Flow or at least reduce it- Menu --> Picture --> (scroll to 2nd page) --> Aspect adjustments --> HD size = Is where you can tell the TV not to chop off the outer 5% of the HD signal. If you're running off cable, satellite receiver, or a blu-ray player, there's little to no chance there'll be any noise that needs trimming.- Note: Picture adjustments are specific to each input jack and will need to be made for each one.Would I recommend this TV to others?

I noticed a big issue with what looks like vertical streaks running vertically across the screen varying in width of around an inch or so. When the picture is panning across a brighter area, it looks like the screen is very dirty, so theres a fixed image of darker shadows going up and down the screen when the picture is moving. Its extremely distracting and everytime theres a scene with motion you cant help but focus on it each time.**One other thing worth mentioning. If you plug in an ethernet cable to use the internet apps, you will get ads across your set when turning the TV on, adjusting the volume, or on the internet apps home screen with NO option to turn it off. I find this extremely insulting and a slap in the face to consumers.So, I tried to call Panasonic support which is a joke. Every time I call they make me run through this time consuming and insulting \"trouble shooting steps\" by unplugging the unit and all devices several times. If I try telling them I already did it, or it wont remedy the problem they refuse to listen and then say theres nothing they can do.  Ive been hung up on several times by their reps who never made any attempts to call me back, and then was told by a supervisor they would not be sending anyone out to look at my TV because \"only TVs 50 inches and larger have in home service\". This is an absolute lie, and my owners manual clearly says 47 inch TVs have in home service. In fact it says TVs 46\" and larger qualify. They refused to listen and the supervisor then told me its the end of his shift and would be hanging up on me. Appalling.After several more call backs I was finally told someone would be calling me back to set up service. This never happened.After finally getting fed up and opening a BBB case someone finally agreed to send a repairman out to see the TV, who agreed there was a problem and it was going to need a new panel. Still am waiting to hear back from the Panasonic field rep about what will happen.I dont want this TV any longer. Because of Panasonic dragging their feet and giving me the runaround my return window with Amazon is gone.**Update**I got Panasonic to agree to a buyback due to all the problems the TV had and because I had opened a BBB case because of their horrible treatment of the problem. Ended up buying a 47\" Vizio 3D tv for $100 less. Could not be happier.

I have been enjoying the TV for the last couple of weeks and have found little not to like.Few observations:Shipping and Handling:* Like some other customer commented, If you are buying this TV do yourself a favor and get the 1 Day shipping. The TV is not at all protected to take the toll of ground shipping.Apps:* The Apps collection are limited. I use Netflix, Hulu and Amazon primarily so those are covered.* Performance is mediocre, launching and navigating through apps is usable.* Skype: one of the interesting feature of the TV. Unfortunately you need to buy a decidedly pricey Panasonic/Logitech webcam to get it to work. I have not experimented with other models, so if you know of one that works please let me know.Usability:* Remote lacks a dedicated picture mode switch button (its invasive to display the huge picture mode OSD during watching something)* The included stand is very sturdy - sits on the tv station like a rock.Connectivity:* Lack of an Analog audio out: I have an older stereo that I used with my TV. It does not work any more because this TV has only digital audio out (in addition to HDMI Audio Return Channel support). Keep this in mind if you are planning to use an older audio system with the TV. An adapter can be used but I still find confusion over which ones will work with this TV.* Limited analog AV input. The TV has only 1 composite and 1 component input for analog AV. That too can not be hooked up at the same time. (Note: its different from not being able to use both. With this TV you have to physically switch the AV cables every time you need to switch between component and composite.) Not many people use both but good to know.Update: 06-17-2012:After using the TV for couple of days I really like it. If only the light bleed was more reasonable (Please see the pictures in Customer Images section to decide for yourself). I requested Amazon for a replacement hoping that its a one unit thing.I am changing the * rating to more accurately reflect overall experience. I wish Amazon had itemized rating for this. To be honest the rating goes as follows:1. Picture:  *****2. Packaging: *3. Styling:  ****4. Sounds:  **5. Settings:  ***6. Amazon CS: *****I'll again update my comments when the replacement comes around. 5* for Amazon service.Original Review:Rated: *I ordered this TV seeing excellent reviews and sweet price point. BUT1. As some other customers also reported. The Factory packaging is very poorly designed. Does not protect the set at all. Like may customers, my set arrived with bent back panel.2. After setting up and turning on the immediate reaction was: What's that butterfly shaped light in the bottom center of the screen? Yes its a very noticeable light bleed. (I'll add some pictures.)Now having said that:The TV meets every other promise and expectation - I love the picture, contrast, color and viewing angles are all great. The light bleed is only visible on black screen.Setup was also painless - very easy to install on the included stand. (it does not rotate.)I am considering replacing the unit - (in case the back light bleed is a one shot defect).

Picture quality, thinness, overall packaging and appearance. This panel is pretty much as good as a comparable Samsung or LG unit, but at a much lower price. Out of the box, the picture is a little dimmer than the Samsung and LG. I would say the Samsung catches your eye the most as it is the brightest, and the LG looks the most accurate. But once you adjust the picture settings, you get a great picture.I wasn't sure what to expect with LED-LCD, but the blacks are VERY black. I couldn't imagine a plasma doing better than this, and I think it has to do with the backlight scanning feature.You won't be disappointed with the picture quality. Great experience. Great viewing angles as expected from an IPS. The TV also turns on very quickly with little or no warm-up time like my old CCFL.CONS:1. I have no idea why Panasonic still includes the \"on\" light on the front bottom panel of the TV. This light glows when the TV is on. Personally I don't think there is any point in having this as it is sometimes distracting, and I know when my TV is on--I can see that the screen is on. Samsung implements this on light nicer in a soft white glowing Samsung logo. LG has nothing that glows, which is the way I think it should be. Nevertheless, it is easily curable with a piece of tape or anything to block the light.2. The unit arrived damaged, with a big dent in the back panel. The dent was so bent I couldn't even plug in the AC plug. The packaging is a little flimsy like others have said, and came with tears and dents in the cardboard.The Viera apps are decent. They impressed me, but only because this is my first smart TV. I don't think the firmware is there yet in terms of smoothness, but everything works. They need to revise the navigation buttons as it is a little cumbersome to find a key just to flip through pages on your homescreen. Overall impressive for a first-generation internet TV, but it is a little slow and clunky. Not too many apps yet.3. MOST IMPORTANTLY, NO WEB BROWSER. This TV does not yet have an app that lets you browse the web. You can only do so by hooking up your computer via HDMI.4. People have complained about the sound, but I think it is adequate. I am by no means an audiophile, nor do I need surround sound. I went to test some soundbars at Best Buy and they just ended up sounding cheap to me. I don't understand why they are so popular right now. I'd rather take the built-in sound, or go for a full-on surround system with free standing speakers.5. Everytime you turn the TV on, you get a little banner advertisement at the bottom of the screen that lasts for 5-10s. While it is not too intrusive, I don't like the fact that I have no option to turn this off. I paid for a TV outright, and did not receive an ad-sponsored subsidy. If Panasonic wants to serve ads to me, they should have included a discount in the price of the unit. They also put ads on your Internet homescreen, but you can move that around so that you don't see it everytime. Still no option to turn it off. Also do not know if they are tracking my browsing/viewing habits to target ads to me.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic TC-L42E50 1080p LCD HDTV", "Author": "Stephen Kovac Jr.", "ReviewID": "R3BYCQDLQROK7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Panasonic L42ED50 LED-LCD television is an excellent television.

At the time I paid $1050 which included free shipping and a $200 amazon credit.Shipping was excellent and easy to schedule. Courier delivered directly into my house and inspected/tested for defects. Courier took packaging with them.TV Pros:-Excellent picture. Honestly the screen it perfectly sharp and the picture is just beautiful.-Since interface, very easy to navigate. You can download the vierra app for iphone to control it but the physical remote is much nicer.-TV is \"internet ready\" more on this later and includes vierra connect which allows you to download different apps through a marketplace similar to app store-TV includes built in media centre however I have an HTPC running XBMC hooked up so I haven't made much use of this.-Built in manual is a nice featureCons:-\"Internet ready\" means that it does not have wi-fi built in and your options are either (1) purchase an expensive proprietary wi-fi dongle or (2) plug into Ethernet directly. I chose to use a powerline plug (internet through your home's power lines) and use ethernet.-Vierra connect, while it sounds cool, really isn't that awesome. Netflix is a big plus and Skype would be, however you must purchase an expensive and proprietary camera to use Skype. I use XBMC on this TV so I really don't have much need for additional internet connectivity-The black levels could be better however with any backlit LED LCD this will always be an issue. The only way to dramatically improve black level performance is with a plasma.General comments:-Soap Opera Effect (SOE): As with any new TV this can be an issue, one that I am very sensitive to. This TV includes options within the settings to completely remove this effect. Previous reviews suggest changing 'Picture Mode' to 'Game' however I did not find that this fixed the SOE. Under video settings there is a 'Motion Picture Setting' option. Panasonic says that this \"improves motion picture quality by reducing motion blur.\" This setting lets you change the amount of motion blur reduction from 'off' to 'strong.' This lets you customize how much the technology is used effectively controlling the SOE. I have mine set at 'weak' and never notice any SOE whatsoever.-Panasonic also provides an option to turn the 3:2 pull down off which also helps control SOE.-TV is very thin profile and has an attractive bezel. Doesn't include 3D but who really cares about that anyways.I am very happy with this television and would recommend to anyone looking for a brand name, attractive and high quality LED LCD high-def TV.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "IPS LCD panels are the way to go...", "Author": "Waikiki", "ReviewID": "R1J59F2CWUHG58", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great TV, no doubt about it.  ISP panels certainly have an advantage over the technologies used by other LCD brands.  Viewing angles are superb. For an edge-lit LED/LCD, this is as uniform backlighting as I have seen. You can only see a few hot spots when there no signal to the set -- and even then, they are not nearly as \"hot\" as the Samsung 55\" which I also own.  The colors pop, and with so many adjustments, you are bound to be able to find the right setting for you.  Sports are awesome!I will spare you a description or review comparing this set to the best plasmas -- if plasma is an option for you because of the slightly deeper blacks -- go for it.  A factor for me was low power (this one uses less than most porch lights), and heat -- I do not want a set that generates ANY significant heat.  This set, on for 3 hours, generates so little heat, you have to hunt for a spot that is even warm, making it great for smaller rooms (bedrooms!).The weak spot?  WIFI.  Just don't bother buying the optional USB WIFI dongle.  It is expensive, clunky, and in general, crappy in it's execution.  Buy Apps to watch TV? Why?  There are so many other ways to stream videos to a TV set -- I use old Mac Mini's.  Any model after 2009 can stream or play any HD  video format using VLC software or directly from Netflix/Amazon/Hulu, etc. websites.

I plan on soon adding game consoles to the setup as I am very pleased how it performs as monitor for gaming.  I run it strictly on game mode to bypass all the processing junk in the TV and let my graphics card on my computer do that instead.  It's connected via HDMI directly to the graphics card and I use the disk drive on the computer for movies.  It's also paired with my amazing 24\" Asus LED monitor which does tend to have slightly better color.I've seen plenty of other critics write about how this model is lacking in a few departments.  The only flaws I recognize from the reviews are minor things such as the packaging (it does really suck, to say the least).  I'm guessing that I may have received one of the newest models off the line as the packaging had \"Proud sponsor of the Olympic Games\" depicted on it, and this about 2 weeks before the 2012 Summer Games.  It seems as though they may have fixed the issue with the manufacturing quality of the medal around the frame as it doesn't seem so cheaply built compared to the one I inspected in a store showroom.  This could be my imagination, but I can attest that the horrible quality packaging was wrecked during the not so careful shipping process that got it here.  However, there were absolutely no cosmetic damages, dings, or dents in the frame around the TV and there were also no signs of screen white bleeding.  This could have just been luck, but I still feel as the quality has been improved over the older show model that I saw in a store.  BTW I begged and offered to pay extra to Amazon to ship it inside of a larger, well-made shipping box, but they declined.  Just a small gripe, it would have been great if Panasonic would have just included the proper mounting screws for the TV and saved me a tech support call along with a trip to the hardware store (FYI, not the friendliest people of India when it comes to tech support)I was told time after time by salesmen and other TV enthusiasts to go plasma for what I was using this TV for, and I stand firmly with confidence behind my decision to go the complete opposite direction with an LED.  I needed/wanted a TV that would work just as well in total darkness as with wide open windows with sunlight while also weighing under 40lbs allowing me to easily/safely mount and un-mount it as needed.  I didn't want 3D and all the over the top fancy gizmos like 640trillion hz because I knew I had no use for them always being in game mode.  The blacks are still black enough for my liking and the picture really couldn't get much better for someone who is literally less than 3 feet away from it during all use.So all you die hard Samsung lovers can keep'em as I've worked in the consumer electronic industry and have seen how Samsung produces more lemons than anyone else.

I have used it for watching hdtv and blurays, as a computer monitor, and playing console games; this unit has not missed a beat.  My unit has little to no bleeding issues and terrific black levels.  While it is not as good as Panasonic's new plasma televisions in terms of overall picture, it is certainly close.  To tell you the truth I was leaning more towards a plasma after seeing them side by side at BB, but the price was too good to pass up.PACKAGINGI was worried after reading about how the packing could lead to damaging of the unit, however I see no such issues.  Unless one of the delivery men is hating his life that day and takes it out on the box, your unit should make the trip just fine.GENERAL USEI have found that game mode looks and performs the best out of the box.  I have not attempted to manually set the picture settings, I will probably never do this since the Game setting is awesome.APPSI have only used the Amazon instant video app on this unit.  Performance was great and I was able to stream at HD resolutions with no problems.  The interface for the app portal is also very responsive, even while watching tv.PC USEIf you are planning on using this as a computer monitor @ 1920x1080 be sure to set the HD size to \"Size 2\" (Picture -> Aspect Adjustments -> HD Size).  If this is not set appropriately you will observe screen cropping.AUDIOAs others have stated, the speakers are not that great.  This is really not a big deal since speakers should always be used with a TV like this.  Does not have a 3.5 analog audio out jack, or any form of analog audio out for that matter.

The details are so vivid that if any show or movie was not filmed for HD 1080p you will notice the difference immediately.Performance----------------The performance is exceptional.

Crisp images from every viewing angle.  Greatly impressed.-Sometimes I game (XBox 360) on this TV, and there is a noticeable, though very slight, lag due to the IPS technology (5ms is the quoted time).  Most of the time it's not apparent, and changing the TV to Game Mode really helps reduce delay and remove artificial enhancements (i.e. \"soap opera effect\").  In fact, I use Game Mode for every input on the TV because I generally dislike the enhancements modern TVs make.-Panasonic has some really good apps for the Viera internet suite.  I am quite happy with Netflix, Youtube, Pandora, and the like on this TV.  The TV can also connect via DLNA to play music/videos from my computer over the network.Cons:-This TV does not have any audio output except for Optical (TOSLINK) out.  This means you will need to purchase an audio signal converter if you want to use computer speakers or a sound system with RCA audio.  I recommend this little guy (though be warned, it cannot convert every signal from the TV.

My aim here is to skip over jargon, and technological mumbo-jumbo that can be found in abundance in previous reviews(i do sincerely thank those people though).T.V. - the back-lit panel is simply stunning, there is no getting around that. The Led lit screen pops with intense colors, and resonates with phenomenal picture - AFTER A LITTLE TWEAKING! You may have read about poor black level perfomance(which is just something you will have to sacrifice with a current led tv), but i am here to tell you that it is more than adequate so long as the tv picture is set correctly. The \"soap opera effect\" is real as well - again, something that is remedied by simply setting up your own picture settings. Below is what has worked very well for me...(These settings may not be ideal for your setup, but they should provide a good base for you to jump off of)Backlight - 18Contrast - 85Brightness - 60Color - 45Tint - 3Sharpness - 50Color temp - normalColor mgmt - offAI picture - offc.a.t.s. - offVideo NR - autoUnder the advanced picture settings -Block NR - autoMosquito NR - AutoMotion picture setting - offBlack level - dark3:2 pulldown - offYou may have also notice the claim that this is a smart tv - Simply put, it is not, which is why i purchased it. It has the potential to be a smart tv if an auxiliary purchase of a wireless adapter is made, and that adapter then hooked to the television. Do yourself a favor, just use a blu-ray player or other streaming device to get the internet content that you may desire. On the note of blu-ray, their picture quality on this television is simply astounding. I might also add that the Mediabrige HDMI cables that are sold on amazon are of incredible quality and will work just as well as higher dollar monster cables.In summation: Personally, i feel the television meets and exceeds the modern standard of picture quality that is to be expected of an led tv. Blu-ray and high-def content are stunning. The television is not smart, but is packed with all the picture customization features that will make any picky videophile happy. There are ample connections, so hooking up all of your gadgetry will not be a concern. At this price point the set is worth its weight in gold.A Quick note on packaging - If you don't have prime, purchase prime - its as simple as that. Other reviewers remarked that the set was shipped in only its original box and quite beat up when it arrived. Shipped from Amazon, my television arrived in not only its own box, but another that surrounded it. Between the two boxes was a sort of packing material i had never seen before, but it more than sufficiently cushioned the package beyond any worry of transit-damage.

I took a leap of faith with Panasonic, based on my satisfaction with their plasmas, and was rewarded.The IPS LED backlit display on this TV is good, it's amazing when you consider that it only cost $600. The display was not like this out of the box though. When this TV arrived I was actally pretty upset with the picture, the contrast was off and there was serious motion blur (soap opera effect).

We are not gamers nor are we interested in 3D display. We chose this Panasonic product after lengthy research into other brands, models and sizes. We almost opted for another, less expensive Vizio model, but by the time we were able to dispose of our old TV, the Vizio model was out of stock. We had seen several Panasonic HDTVs and had never been disappointed with the Panasonic, so it was next on the list.We received the HDTV about 5 days after ordering through Amazon. After assembling the TV stand, we unpacked the TV. There is a diagram on the side of the box, that the HDTV is shipped in, that has artwork on one side of the box indicating the unpacking procedure. The procedure is very easy for two people. There are 4 plastic latches that allow the top section of the box to be lifted away from the monitor. We chose to mount the monitor on the pedestal, as opposed to a wall mounting. The mounting procedure is clearly indicated with an exploded diagram found in the owner's manual. The assembly screws are found in 2 different plastic packages. There are 2 different screw sizes used for mounting the monitor to the pedestal. One size screw (4 each) attaches the bracket to the base. The other size screw (4 each) attaches the monitor to the bracket. The bracket fits precisely into a slot in the monitor and when the monitor has been seated on the bracket the screws line up perfectly. The assembly procedure is easy to follow and well engineered.There is a characteristic that the purchaser will want to know about. The base has a raised integral mount that the bracket attaches too. This raised integral mount is apparently designed to yield slightly and pitches slightly with the weight of the monitor. Since the model we purchased has a 55-inch monitor, and is naturally top heavy, this presents a bit of unease with monitor stability. We found the azimuth orientation we preferred for the monitor and haven't moved it. There is no swivel to the base, so azimuth orientation means moving the entire base.After attaching the cabling, which is also clearly indicated in the owner's manual, we powered on via the remote and followed eHELP, which is essentially a built-in manual that is always available and performed a first time set-up.One thing that I have noticed about the remote is that I unintentionally keep reformatting the display. The format button is immediately above the number buttons, and I am connected to cable TV, so I have not yet trained myself to tactilely discriminate between these buttons.We love the picture display, and the audio is acceptable.

I have never had a smart TV before, or a TV this size. I was concerned about the packaging as many reviews said it was inadequate and the TV ended up with minor damage on occasion.  I did not have this problem as I used Amazon Prime, and it was delivered within 2 days by a specialty carrier and was hand carried by two delivery personel.  The packaging was perfectly intact.  I highly recommend that you go this route....otherwise, your TV will likely be in transit for days and days, and no telling what it will go through.I purchased the Panasonic sound bar with this TV as the reviews again suggested that the TV speakers left a little to be desired.  I have to be honest, this TV has amazing sound on its own.  You do NOT need to buy additional audio capability unless you just plan on jamming to the multiple music apps available on this smart TV.  I purchased the Dish wall mount installation package because I was concerned that since this was my first big smart TV that I might be a little bit technologicaly impaired.  The service was first class, however in hindsight, I could have easily installed this thing with just a helping hand to pick it up, not because its heavy, its just so big that it would be very awkward for one set of hands to do it alone.The picture is absolutely outstanding.  And much like the many reviews that I read, its so intense that it does in fact have the soap opera effect when in vidid mode.  Just put it in game mode and it \"smooths\" it out very effectively.  The internet capablity is very simple, the apps are very navigable, and I am already streaming music and movies.  I have also connected it to my computer via a LAN cable and HDMI cable.  I did not want to deal with the additional \"dongle\" that is available for purchase that got poor reviews, and a LAN cable is around 7 bucks for a 15 footer, plus with the LAN cable, its plug and play, no setting or configuration to deal with.Great TV for the price...I just couldnt find anything else in this size with these capablities at this price.Now the BAD news.  The TV had a low level screeching noise immediately upon plugging it in.  I could only hear it when the sound was low or off.  But this TV comes with concierge service.  I called them, and had a tech at the house within a couple of days.  Turned out it was a bad transformer on a circuit board.  They ordered the part and once it arrived they came back and installed it within minutes.  Just a part of modern electronics in my opinion, some times things go wrong.

I can only find a few things about this tv that I can criticize and they are just minor things. First like all slim LEDs the speakers are awful. I lasted 2 days before I had to run out and get a sound bar. I was expecting this however. Second I wish there were more composite connections in the back. The TV has plenty of HDMI ports but I have a few components in which dont use HDMI (or more likely Im too cheap to buy the HDMI connector for) so I was only able to hook up one of them.

You can get the best performance in any size provided you're willing to pay for it.  If not, then there must be some compromises.Amazon has been listening to customer complaints about shipping damage and my set was delivered double boxed in a considerably larger box which had loose cardboard type stuffing.  A note of caution, this is a large purchase in terms of size and would be a pain to return.  I would STRONGLY advise paying the extra $4 for next day Prime shipping.  The less time it spends with FedEx or UPS, the less chance of damage.PROS:1.  In Plane Switching (S-IPS) Panel which is ideal for off-axis viewing.  LG and Sharp manufacture most of these panels and I believe Panasonic sources the panel from LG, though I am not 100% certain on this model.2.  The black levels improve considerably when you calibrate this set using various calibration test patterns from:X-Rite i1Display 2 Color Calibrator for LCD, CRT, and Laptop DisplaysSpears & Munsil High-Definition Benchmark Blu-ray Disc Edition [Blu-ray]3.  The colors are quite good and pleasing when watching from most HD sources, but be aware that it is important for the source to broadcast correctly.4.  The 120 Hz refresh hasn't caused me any issues yet.  On 1080p material the Soap Opera Effect (SOE) can be turned off, but it doesn't bother me right now.5.  The edge lit LED uses less power and I do not notice this set getting hot in my cabinet.  The manual states power useage is about 120 Watts.6.  Built-in RJ-45 ethernet port allows you to hook up to your home network for Netflix, Hulu and YouTube. It also allows you to use a USB wireless LAN adapter, but it has to be a Panasonic one.7.  4 HDMI ports, which is really nice.8.  The remote is not bad, but I could see some people not be use to it and accidentally pressing the wrong buttons and waiting to get out of a menu.9.  Thin and relatively light weight makes this set ideal for wall mounting.CONS (all of these cons combined are in my opinion enough to take away one star):1.  There is back light bleed around the edges and in my unit, which was not damaged at all in shipping, has noticeable bleed on the upper and left side parts of the panel which affects the picture quality.  If you watch movies with dark scenes, then this is irritating. You can reduce the back light intensity and contrast to control the back light bleed, but it may be detrimental to picture quality in other ways.  Some people have noticed the Mura effect or \"clouding\", but I did not see this.2.  The stand is somewhat weak and this set can not be rotated in azimuth.  It works for what it is.3.  At 47\" diagonal, this set is not ideal for home theater use and more suited for general living room, basement and gaming use.  So, I would expect the speakers to be a bit better.

Have really enjoyed it. The picture quality is exceptional, and there are many modes and various customizations you can play with. The modes seem to be right on the money for describing their best uses... Game mode for video games, Cinema mode for movies. It's fun to tweak on the fly and see what works best.I'm mostly writing to caution people about the wireless adapter. As you've probably discovered, the TV is WiFi-ready but you have to buy a separate adapter for around $55 or $65. I purchased the adapter but returned it and paid a little more for a smart Sony Blu-Ray player which accomplishes all of the same things. Why? The way Panasonic handles Netflix streaming is absolutely annoying. I have a very good internet connection and my router is feet from the television. And yet, when using Panasonic's Netflix app, the picture will inevitably and frequently blink to black in the middle of a presentation. As I understand, this is due to \"adaptive streaming\": that is, Netflix intelligently changes streaming quality on the fly rather than screeching the show to a halt as streaming battles bandwidth. Panasonic's way of dealing with adaptive streaming is to blink black between streaming changes. Sony and other companies' way of dealing with adaptive streaming is to make the picture low-res for a little bit, and then sharpen it up. No blink.I don't know about most people, but I certainly prefer a tiny bit of standard-res video to a black blink, which drived me nuts. What will mostly happen on Netflix using my Sony player is that the show's first 5 or 7 seconds will start out standard-res, then the picture will seamlessly go high-res and look great for the rest of the show. Only rarely do I get a brief standard-res change in the middle of the show, and even then, no black blink. Using Panasonic's Netflix, a half-hour show will blink probably 8-10 times as res changes. This to me is simply unacceptable.I wrote to Panasonic about this specific issue, and they suggested generic unhelpful things like \"reset your router.\" Hah.In summary, beautiful TV, but if you're a heavy Netflix user like myself, do yourself a favor and skip their wireless adapter for another company's smart player.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "thebrakeman", "ReviewID": "R3DBDCDSHOH50S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We moved our Panasonic 32\" S1 1080p TV downstairs to make room for this 42\".

As far as as the motion processing, it will give you the \"soap opera effect\" if you have the advance motion processing on while watching film-based content, but it's easy enough to turn off.  I haven't had a chance to try out the smart-tv features because you have to buy an additional part to pick up wifi signals and I don't feel like routing an ethernet cable over my living room floor.  I have an xbox for that which great and I didn't buy it for that anyway.  What I did buy it for and where this tv excels is video games.  I've tried a few fancy flat screens tvs before I settle on this one and input lag was a huge issue (even when in their game-mode).  Panasonic must have paid special attention to the problem of input lag because in game mode the lag is imperceptable.  This tv is a breath of fresh air to anyone who has ever been frustrated by input lag on another tv.  I can't say enough about how satisfied I am with this tv's gaming preformance.  I've noticed that tv reviews rarely spend any time on this critical aspect of television preformance and to find information on this issue, one has to be prepare to sift through fairly muddled forum posts.  In addition there is quite a lot of misleading information out there.  For instance, I had originally purchased a Sharp Aqous marketed with a .016 ms lag time.  I'm not sure where they got that statistic, but it didn't refence the set's lag relevant to gaming.  The set was horrible and made gaming frustrating and unenjoyable.

For those looking for a new TV, this is a 1080P LED-LCD, 120 Hz, Non-3D, Internet-enabled Smart TV. The picture is great, colors are vibrant & black levels are very good.  I did notice a little jitter when watching football, but that's my only picture complaint in a month or so of viewing. Smart Features - this TV has a preset array of applications that include Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, Facebook and several others. This is my first experience with \"Smart\" features and I enjoy having them. I was slightly disappointed that there is no generic browser capability, but not a deal breaker.  So far there are enough HDMI inputs (4) & USB (2). This TV only has Digital Optical Audio Out, so if you have an older Analog Stereo Receiver, you'll need to get a Digital-Analog converter to connect your TV to stereo sound. (or upgrade to a new digital receiver). I would recommend buying a USB Wireless keyboard to type in movie titles, YouTube searches, etc as it is kind of a pain to type using the TV remote.  I personally bought a Logitech K400 Wireless Keyboard & it works perfectly with this TV. The last point I want to make is that this TV is only Internet-Enabled, meaning that it has a network input to plug in a physical internet cable, but if you want to utilize wireless then you'll need to buy a Panasonic USB Wireless Adapter (Price ~ $50).

We were on a strict $500 budget (had a $500 gift card) so when the Amazon Warehouse price for the \"good condition- USED\" model dipped to $495, we jumped on it.The box arrived in excellent condition.  I searched high and low for scuffs, scratches or other flaws which accompany the description of this \"used\" product.  We didn't see anything...not even a light scratch.  The set started flawlessly and displays a bright, vivid, sharp picture.  It's a terrific set and a great value.There's nothing \"used\" about this set.

We use the ethernet port provided in the back and have not purchased the wifi dongle.Football and Hockey are also heavily watched and they are shown in perfect crystal HD. No Ghosting or blurring. Blu ray and DVD also are fantastic.We have noticed no lines or banding or bleed through that some others have reviewed with. In fact the viewing angles are large with crisp picture and color saturation, every seat in the den offers the same picture and even if I'm standing off to the side of the tv.The most surprising thing was the sound is not as awful as we expected and even though it sometimes has to be turned up almost full volume to hear dialogue or sports announcing, the surround effects on the tv speakers are a bit better than the soundbar we purchased.In other words I would say you can still enjoy the tv if you want to shop around or save up for a home-theater speaker set-up. You will be able to get by on the TV speakers.The final major reason we chose this tv over a smart samsung is the number of ports. Their are alot of media boxes out there so the SD card reader, VGA port, and 2 USBs are not as important (just extra nice) but it has FOUR HDMI outputs and I honestly don't know how people only make due with 1 or 2. We have a Bluray/DVD player, an Xbox, a satellite box, and a laptop taking them all up. I guess other people switch them in and out, but what a pain.

I really wanted a 60\" and considered brands like Samsung and Vizio instead.  Ultimately the deal i received on this tv was too good to pass up ($850 plus $50 for the WiFi adapter).  Plus the problem Vizio has had with audio and their panels made me look elsewhere.  Even with the peace of mind of a Square Trade Protection Plan, who wants to deal with an expensive 60\" paper weight hanging on your wall?Which ironically brings me to my first point.... the first delivery i received had a defective panel.  Pixels about the size of a nickel in the middle of the screen were dim.  Amazon was fantastic about the exchange and delivered the new one inside of a week via CEVA and the delivery men assisted in the removal of the old tv off the wall and installation of the new tv.At first i regretted my purchase.  Having a 50\" Samsung plasma prior to this, i was used to much deeper blacks and an overall sharper picture.  It just so happened that my grandmother just bought a 55\" Samsung (non Smart) for $900 and my parents bought a 46\" Samsung Smart in the same month as me.  I had the luxury of viewing both of their tv's last week and I'm happy to report that even after tweaking their pictures, I like this Panasonic the best.  Samsungs UI for the Smart features is much better than Panny's but that's a small trade-off.Ultimately i chose an LED over Plasma for a few reasons.

I was looking for something similar to a 46\" Samsung LED LCD TV several of my friends owned. Here's what I found out now that I've got this 47\" Panasonic unpacked and working.Pros: Highly adjustable picture. Some complained of the Soap Opera Effect (SOE) which essentially makes everything look too lifelike (loses its cinematic appeal). With the latest software update this TV allows you to adjust (in the advanced picture setting) the SOE from none/weak/medium/strong. I found the weak setting to work well without being noticeable enough to annoy. You can also use this TV as a media hub where all your HDMI devices can be connected and shutoff based on selected preferences. There are a strong set of options to allow a good deal of customization for your home theatre setup. The IPS technology should be familiar to most smartphone users. It essentially allows someone from the kitchen to watch the same show (at an angle) and get exactly the same picture colors as someone on the coach. It's great for sports or watching the news if you don't really want to be right on front of the TV to get the best view. The stand that comes with the TV is great! It is heavy duty where it needs to be and looks good once assembled. It can also be taken apart for moving purposes. I highly recommend using the internet features (via a WiFi USB stick or an ethernet cable). It can be updated via the internet and does have some useful features I still need to explore more.Cons: The 'power on' light is a red square LED. It does not really bother me (the worst would be a blue LED), although some might find it distracting. A Sharpie should tone it down nicely if it does bother. This TV does not really get a regular TV signal. Get a good antenna if you want to pick some channels up the old fashioned way.Recommendation: It's awesome, a great value, buy it!", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Picture & Great Viewing Angle", "Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "R3SL0G0YTN2YAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've owned this TV for about a month now. It is a great value in that it offers a lot for a bargain price. The picture quality is excellent. Very sharp and with lots of options for tweaking the picture. The viewing angle is as good as advertised. Both from at the TV from the sides or below seems to have minimal impact if any on the picture quality.The styling is excellent. It's thin and has a small frame around the edges so that the TV doesn't stick out.Audio quality is on par with other HDTV's - not good, but no worse than others.I love the on screen menus - the volume and input menus that pop up are in the corners, out of the way, so that they do not distract from the picture.Although Panasonic brags about using the motion smoothing technology to bump its 120 refresh rate to 360, I highly recommend turning this off. It often makes images in motion distracting. The TV handles motion well with its actual 120HZ rate.The TV has Panasonic Smart Apps built in. This means we can stream using Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Cinema Now, Vudu and others. In the month we've owned the TV Panasonic has already updated the internet interface once to include a new app. The TV has a built in ethernet port, which we are using. Or you can purchase a wireless adapter.The TV has four HDMI ports, but it has only one port with an external adapter that works with either component or AV cables.

My previous TV was so old that I assumed any modern LED TV would be vastly superior and I did not want to waste money.  I was wrong.  The LG TV was blurry, even after changing the settings, and had poor viewing angles and motion.  It also had a malfunction that caused me to return it, which was a blessing in disguise.  I decided to rethink my approach and get a better TV rather than a bigger TV.  That led me to this Panasonic VIERA TV (TC-L42E50).FEATURESThere is no 3D capability or built-in wifi, which helps keep this version of the VIERA relatively inexpensive.  The latter can be remedied with a wifi dongle, but for that price you may prefer a Roku anyway.  Regardless, it does have media features built in, including two conveniently located USB ports.FINISHThe bezel is not as thin as some competitors, but the TV looks very nice and understated.  The thickness of the unit is tiny compared to my old TV and would look very fancy with a flush wall mount.  To keep things thin, the plug is not the standard PC type, which for me means taking off the wall mount to switch from the old type.  I think it is worth the hassle, though.PICTUREWow.  The colors are rich and the viewing angles are super wide, as expected with IPS.  Blacks will not match the top end Plasmas, but look great for an LED TV.  I am continually impressed with this TV.MOTIONMotion looks great on this TV.  It has optional motion interpolation that works very nicely, though we have been trained to think of 24 fps as being correct for movies.  Thankfully, the option is easy to change depending on preference.  I decided to embrace it and now really like the less choppy look.  It works even better with content actually rendered in higher frame rates, such as video games.OVERALLI am very happy with the TC-L42E50, with its excellent picture, viewing angles, and motion presentation.

I have had a Panasonic plasma since 2009 and have always enjoyed the excellent picture it provides.  I was hesitant to go with an LED/LCD after the endless hours of research I had done.  Given the four HDMI inputs and the advertised great viewing angles of this IPS set, I decided to give it a try.  There was a lot I liked about the set: thin profile, low power consumption, bright picture, number of HDMI inputs, and the Panasonic name.  What I didn't like about the set and what ultimately had me switch it out, were the following.  First, it had a very noticeable lip sync issue that I've read about others having on this model as well.  I contacted Panasonic about it, and they were as close to useless as one could imagine.  I have basic cable, so my connection goes directly into the set via the coaxial.  The rep wanted to blame it on my cable box, but was then stumped when he found out I didn't have one.  If it was just a problem with the cable, I could have probably lived with it, but it also affected my Roku player via HDMI and even my Sony Blu-Ray player via HDMI as well.  It literally manifested itself like a late night, old school karate flick.  It was very noticeable not only through the set's speakers, but also through my Harman Kardon surround system hooked up via Toslink.  I updated the software via the online connection and ultimately reset the panel completely, losing all of my settings, but the problem persisted.  Beyond the lip sync issue, I was also disappointed in the off axis viewing angles.  This is advertised as one of this panel's strong points, but as soon as I was even 15-20 degrees off center, the contrast and color saturation took a noticeable hit.  Being an edge lit set, the uneven light bleed in dark scenes even with the brightness and backlighting turned down was a problem also.  The last issue that did it for me was the handling of motion.  I tried the various increments of the motion setting, but none of them can compete with the picture on a plasma.  Once you get above medium, you attain smoothness, but you also have a very unnatural affect.Costco had a great deal on the 60\" LG 1080P plasma, so I ended up going with that.  I would have obviously preferred a Panasonic, but at the price they're offering the LG at, it's an unbeatable value.  On a side note, none of the problems listed above are an issue with this LG, including the lip sync.  Regardless of the set's speakers or my surround system, the lip sync is perfect, as it is on my Panasonic plasma.

Very little to no pixilation-the only noticeable pixilation I observed was in running \"The Hobbit' off of Amazon Prime and it was for a few seconds on the scene where they were zoomed in on the map and that was VERY minor. Considering the manner which the movie was shot I had expected this and expected more pixilation but there was none after that. I am well pleased.2. Audio quality: I have a 14x17 foot living room and the sound quality is excellent. Mind you, if you are expecting the same audio quality and loudness as a $1,000/1,000 watt home theatre system out of the TV's built in speakers you will be a bit disappointed but you are a fool if you expected that in the first place. My brother in law was here and we had to jack up the audio so he could hear it (he is deaf in one ear) and at 50% he could hear everything along with scaring the bejabbers out of the pets and making my sister and I deaf. I set the TV to 20% and my sister and I could hear everything just fine. I did not have to change any of the settings from the factory defaults.3. VIERA Connect and Internet: Had absolutely NO problems connecting. My modem/router sits right under the TV on the TV stand so instead of buying the Wi-Fi dongle I hooked it up using an Ethernet cable. Hulu/Netflix/Amazon Prime streaming works as it should. YouTube app via VIERA connect works smoothly and the picture quality is excellent even on videos that I know are 360p maximum quality. The 1080p YouTube videos are crisp, sharp and as they should be. BTW The YouTube sync app works with Kindle Fire HD. Pandora and all the other apps work as they should. The only complaint I have with VIERA connect is that they do not have the selection that Roku has but that is to be expected and am sure it will get better with time.3. Roku Box: I already owned a Roku LT box before buying this TV-it is the low end one that only cranks out 720p. I had an old Sony Wega so needed no more than that. I hitched it up using an HDMI cable and my only complaint with it is that the video level seems to be a bit low but not unwatchable-audio is fine. Considering that everything else looks fine I figure that it is a problem with the Roku box and not the TV. I intend to upgrade to Roku 3 because I am giving my old TV/Roku box to a friend. I am sure once I upgrade that problem will be solved. BBC world service does look a bit funky but am guessing that it is because it is being converted from PAL to NTSC-it is watchable, though.4. USB/SD: I have many videos on my computer that I wanted to watch on my TV which is part of the reason why I bought this particular TV. Most of these videos are in .flv (flash) or MP4. Some of the programs I have are segmented because I edited out the commercials and before I got this TV I used to watch them on my computer using RealPlayer. These videos were already organized into individual folders on my computer and I highly suggest you do the same if you intend watching video on this TV from a USB device otherwise you will be wading through alot of 'stuff' to find your pony ifyouknowwhatimean. I loaded all of them up on a 32 gig USB stick and plugged the stick into the TV. Worked flawlessly but I did have to rename some of the programs in order to make them easier to sort. The segmented programs already existed in their individual folders and will play in sequence if you turn off the autorepeat feature in the menu.I also loaded up a bunch of pictures/music (in their own folders) and tried out the slideshow function. Worked as it should but for some reason it will not show some of the pictures even though they are all .jpeg. I think this might be because of the way some of them are named so I am going to try renaming some of them. Will edit this review to let you know if that worked. Another point is that even though the slideshow function will randomize the pictures it will not randomize the music-it plays the music in the order it was loaded onto the stick. If you want to have the music to be 'random' instead of playing entire albums create your own 'random' order when loading the music into its folder.5. DVD player: Works as it should. The Sony 5 DVD carousel player is hitched up with an HDMI cable, the Magnavox DVD burner is hitched up with composite video/audio cables using the adapter provided by Panasonic. Most of the DVD's I have are of old movies/TV programs that were not produced in anything that resembles HD thus there really is no reason to buy them on Blue Ray even if I could get them on Blue Ray. I really do not intend to buy a Blue Ray player because I will just buy the digital downloads of the movies I want and either watch them off of the cloud or load them up onto stick drives or SD cards. BTW the 3:2 pulldown works as intended.6. Computer: I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop that I am using with this TV. it is connected using an HDMI cable though I can throw video/pictures etc. to the TV via my home network. I am not using that function because I loaded all that stuff on the USB stick plugged into the TV and using the TV's software to run them. The main function the computer is being used for is to watch BBC and ITV programs from their websites using either BBC iPlayer or ITV Player. Video and audio is broadcast standard. I am thinking of getting a wireless keyboard and using it to browse the internet but (at the moment) I do not really think I would use that much. If I am doing gaming or heavy internet usage I will just use my computer set up in my computer room.Overall impression: I would buy this TV again in a heartbeat. it does everything I want it to and more.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "An excellent TV that falls slightly short of its potential", "Author": "Gabe", "ReviewID": "R103133RH22XK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me say straight of the bat that this is a really excellent TV. Panasonic really made it not only beautiful to the eye, but easy to set up and use. The second I took it out of the box, I was amazed by how thin it was.I'm going to break this down piece by piece:Packaging.It came in a very compact box, but had enough protection that I was sure it could never be damaged in shipping unless it was dropped from a building. It comes with all the standard things you would expect - remote, batteries for the remote (Panasonic brand of course), a full manual, a quick-start guide, a cable for attaching component cables, and even a large, reusable ziptie for cable management. Not shabby.Setup.Could not have been much easier. There was a little bit of confusion as to which screws go where, but with a little common sense you can figure it out. It took about 5 minutes to have the TV completely assembled.Picture.Absolutely stunning. The refresh rate appears to actually be much faster than 60Hz, since I get the soap opera effect. (SOE). I actually prefer the smooth motions, but if you don't then you can change the picture to GAME mode, and it will look \"normal\". The viewing angles are great - the colors looks true at ANY angle (which is what an IPS panel advertises).Sound.Not the best. But it is affections for the average consumer. I personally think I shouldn't have to be at the 80-90% range of max volume to hear clearly. Obviously I will have to be pairing this TV with a sound system to have any respectable sound. I'm not exactly dissatisfied with the sound, mainly because the TV is so thin that I understand how the sound can't really be that good.Internet Capabilities / SMART TV.Okay, so here is one of the places where this TV fell short for me. First of all, it does not have wi-fi built in, it is WiFi READY. Meaning that you have to either purchase an expensive proprietary wifi dongle, OR hook up an ethernet cable from your cable box to the TV (if you even have a box capable of doing it...I have U-Verse and was able to do it). I even tried plugging in my Xbox wifi dongle to the USB port in the TV and it did not work. Bummer. But it did work with an ethernet cable. However, even though it is plugged in with an ethernet, the TV will STILL run an internet test every time you want to access the internet features like Netflix. Very annoying waste of time. Netflix works great though, and did I mention it has a dedicated Netflix button on the remote?One last gripe about the internet capabilities - Skype. I was excited about the concept of using video chat on my TV at first. But quickly realized it wasn't going to work. I have one of the most common webcams in the world from Logitech, and when I plug it in, Skype says they cannot recognize it. Not sure if it is my fault, but I'm not going to put myself through a headache just to get a picture for skype.So again, the TV is excellent overall. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase, and would not trade it for any other TV, UNLESS it came with built-in WiFi and wireless speakers.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Have had no problem at all so far", "Author": "gs", "ReviewID": "R29MHN0N8QL7X2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some people have expressed disappointment with product quality, but I have had no issues at all. I readily admit to not being an over the top person needing new electronics all the time as they are developed, but this is far superior to the older 22 inch HDTV I had had for a few years. And initially, I was a bit concerned that its picture quality was not quite vivid enough for my tastes, but the built-in trouble shooter was simple to call up on-screen and follow directions to get the picture quality exactly as I wanted it to be. So no problems so far.*UPDATE* Still quite happy with the TV....no follow-up issues after several months either. However, originally I set it up to play through a fairly simple but good quality home theater system, so I was not aware of how the TV speakers sounded. Sound was so good that, for the first time in 8 years living in my upstairs apartment, my neighbor downstairs complained she could hear the TV, and wasn't too happy about it. If nothing else, I am a considerate neighbor, and now use the TV speakers for the majority of viewing, and only use the home theater system certain times. And yes, I agree the TV speakers are fairly weak, as many others have commented. It is okay for me, since it is a smaller apartment, and to keep peace in the building, but it might be a considerable disappointment for others.

So I went ahead and ordered it even though i was a little worried about the shipping. When it arrived though it was in perfect condition powered up and worked flawlessly.Pros - Picture is great! Probably the best you can ask for in a led/lcd. Smart TV Apps all work fine although the Netflix app's interface is a little less impressive than Xbox's. But either way it still works fine. Viera Link is an awesome feature. I hooked up my Sony Home theater system to it via a single HDMI cable and the TV automatically recognized it, turned off it's internal speakers and allowed me to control the volume on the home theater system with the tv remote.Cons - Sound. Like with most super thin led tvs you're really gonna need at least a sound bar of some sort if you want to enjoy decent sound. Wireless, If you need Wifi you have to buy an adapter.

For some reason, Panasonic chose to put all of the HDMI jacks on the left side edge of the television. Because of this, they are constantly getting loose. After a year and a half of loosing picture and / or sound for a given source, I'm thinking of getting rid of it. Too bad because otherwise, it's a great TV.Here is my original review:I would be hard pressed to not rate this TV 5 Stars considering Amazon's super low price and free 2 day Prime shipping. The picture is beautiful (better than a Sony in another room), the design fabulous (border is shiny black with narrow-thin clear border, the setup is very easy, the controls are user-friendly, the built-in surround sound is crisp, and the overall quality is typical Panasonic excellent. All this for less money than you'd spend for an off brand 42\" TV at the brick / mortar stores. And, with an Amazon Prime membership, delivered to your door in 2 days for free! Amazing.Aside from all this good stuff, I can report  3 minor issues. Be aware that this TV does NOT HAVE BUILT-IN Wi-Fi. It is pre-loaded with the Panasonic Viera internet apps but requires either a $50 Wi-Fi adapter or hard-wired Ethernet cable to connect to a network. The second issue is that all of the HDMI jacks are mounted on the side of the unit. Ergo, they tend to get loose on their own. Finally, there is only one component input for your non-HD devices.

Frankly, I didn't find that exercise too helpful except to educate me about pricing; the images themselves seemed very similar, after accounting for the different specifications and angles of view and settings, which can be changed at home.I also read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere for many of the TVs I was considering.  After reading one of the top reviews for this TV that described in extraordinary detail, continuing for dozens of comments, the unfortunate owner's nightmarish experience trying to fix the one he purchased, I was hesitant to buy it.  But there being so many positive reviews, and the price being one of the lowest for any name-brand TV with these specs, and Amazon offering free shipping to my location of this particular item (unlike most third-party venders selling some contenders), and Amazon (at least at the time) throwing in a hundred dollar credit, I decided to take the plunge.  So far, I'm glad I did.Delivery was on the day promised, only a few days after ordering.  I upgraded from an old CRT TV hooked up to a DVD player and a home theater using an analog cable signal.  It took me a couple of hours to unpack the screen, attach the base, and connect all of the wiring to allow use with a digital/HD cable box and DVD player.  The instructions were clear and straightforward.  I discovered that to play audio through my receiver for the home theater I needed an optical audio cable (because my receiver has no HDMI input), but those are available for a few dollars through Amazon, or for literally five times as much from Radio Shack.  Consolidating most--not all--functions into one universal remote took another few minutes, and then I was enjoying my new set-up.I tweaked the image settings somewhat, as much for the fun of it as for any real need.  I've noticed something another reviewer pointed out:  the \"soap opera effect\" with some movies.  Hard to describe what this looks like, but you'll probably know it when you see it, and I don't really like it--it looks like the program was created on cheap videotape instead of film.  This is common to many HDTVs, but one can get rid of it on this one by switching the image setting to \"game.\" Otherwise, I find the picture great--crisp, clear, bright, colors balanced, no strange lines or lag or whatnot.  How does it look side by side with a Samsung?  I don't know, and I don't care.  It looks great and I'm happy with it.Next I ran a long ethernet cable from the TV to my router so I can stream Netflix, etc.; otherwise you'll need to buy a dongle so the TV will receive wi-fi signals, and depend on the strength of your wi-fi, which I don't care to.  The TV comes with apps for Netflix, Huluplus, Youtube, and others, and you can access them as soon as you make the hardwired or wi-fi connection.  However, entering a search one letter at a time using the on-screen interface and the remote is very slow and inconvenient (and I had no luck at all trying to use the Android apps that supposedly turn your smartphone into a remote).  I see now why people say that if you want to stream, don't bother with a \"smart\" TV or Blu-Ray player, get a Roku or Apple TV box for the interface.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb quality, great as a PC monitor", "Author": "Comp Expert \"Comp\"", "ReviewID": "R1I6H4YODTVGQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been using my set for a few days now and can suffice to say that you're getting a quality product here, unlike much of the no-name junk brands being sold today.  No high pitched whining noises, artifacting, bleeding, or any weird things that start to happen with the off-brands.  I primary wanted my 55\" set to serve as a PC monitor from my couch lounging so I could primarily surf the web and use my PC as the media server (the best type of media server, hands down).  As anyone knows, text quality on tv sets are not quite the same as text quality on a true PC monitor.  That is, until I found this set.  The quality is right there up with the top standards.  Easy to read, no strange colors or excessive blinding brightness that hurts your eyes after reading the screen for a few minutes.Off-angle viewing is wildly awesome - I am honestly sitting at about 150 degrees out and there's no color shifts or anything like that - a true test of the real world strength of an IPS panel.  You're paying for that here folks and it throws back the results to you.There are really no cons with this set - it does have Internet connectivity with an ethernet cord.  The options are a little sparse compared to other set-top devices but as I use my PC, none of this matters, and one can get a really cheap Roku box very inexpensively these days if you do not have a PC hookup but want far expanded Internet streaming options.  As for sound - true, it's not loud and pretty basic but that only means they spent less money on speakers and instead threw it into the visuals.

It is a huge screen for not much cash, and would be hard to beatI'd recommend this unit as a spectacular value for those wanting lots of features, a very nice picture and sound, and internet options.Some background:Finally LED-backlit LCD panels dropped to a price level I felt was acceptable. As implied by my nickname, I'm of the generation that doesn't pay for tv and I will admit that, as my eyesight weakens, the detail available in today's fine sets is somewhat wasted. Nonetheless after reading many reviews and watching over the last year or two, it was time for me to make the leap, and I selected this unit from among quite a few.I wanted to cut my electric bill.. I admit that, though I don't pay much attention to it most of the time, my tv is on much of the day and night.. so I thought I'd do a bit of my part for the environment and get rid of my huge, old analog crt tv that probably consumes on the order of 300 watts and additionally has a digital tuner that I bought when tv switched to digital a few years ago. This one uses a max of about 52 watts! Also, I thought a \"real digital tuner\" rather than the \"add-on\" for my old analog tv might give better reception.The purchase and setup experience:The purchase experience was wonderful as I have come to expect from Amazon. The set arrived in about three days. The box was a bit banged up, but the tv was in fine condition. I fumbled my way through the assembly and setup in about an hour (recall my eyesight is marginal).I had a bit of a problem finding a few of the parts.. be sure to CAREFULLY examine all the Styrofoam pieces and packing.. the parts are scattered throughout the packing material, not in a central bag or pack... Some was even taped to the inside of the box..  only a minor problem, just be aware.I hooked my antennae (remember, FREE TV!) and plugged in the set.. scanned channels and had it working. It was frankly beautiful..Next I hooked up my Ethernet (I did not buy a wireless connection for it) and briefly checked out the internet offerings. The tv updated it's software automatically as soon as it recognized the connection.I signed up for the \"Amazon\" network .. this was easy .. took maybe three minutes. Their free offerings are pretty lame, but I was doing it only to check out the internet experience. It was quite a nice result even if the navigation is a bit clunky .. not bad though. Once the movie or whatever is \"online\", all is well.Detail Overview:Pluses-Excellent 42inch picture at a very reasonable price.-Allows direct internet access.  For the \"standard services\" it seems fine. It is preconfigured for a large list of services for video, tv, games, etc-The internet (DLNA) connection also allows the tv to be a member of your home network, and therefore to act as a streaming object for music, video, pictures, or recorded tv programs (ie. from a TiVo-type device)-allows excellent connectivity with 4 HDMI inputs, a composite (vcr, etc), a direct pc input (DVI or use one of the HDMI) and of course an antennae/cable connection (coaxial cable)-2 USB connects and a card reader (microSDHC, etc) for reading from your camera videos or pictures or from files loaded onto a USB device. Some of the interfaces require alphanumeric inputs. A USB keyboard can be connected for these or the remote works with the \"multi-punch\" inputs like many non-qwerty cellphones use. A mouse isn't recognized.-I find that the I/O is reasonably placed with appropriate I/O on back or side to meet most needs-Offers a range of picture \"modes\" for movie, game-play (low lag) and custom setups for those picky about color setup-The remote is well laid-out with most buttons logically placed. (I have some minor complaints .. see later)-Has various timer modes including on/off at times and channels as you select and a feature I like that turns the tv off if for some reason it has no input for 10 minutes or if no one uses an interface for three hours (for example if you fall asleep watching it) And it has the normal \"sleep\" after x minutes.-Has nice options for those who need/want closed caption.. for example CC if you mute, control of text size, contrast, etc for the captions, language options, and of course various SAP options-The sound.. very competent for a tv..  I typically watch from my dining room while the set is in the living room and it is plenty loud with good sound... anyone wanting more would buy add-on units anyways. Connection is optical.-Viewing angles are quite acceptable.-A feature I very much appreciate (weak eyesight) is being able to get manuals and quick start documents online from the Panasonic website in pdf form which allows me to magnify the text and illustrations for much better visibility.-I think the set is quite attractive. Off, it is a large black rectangle framed in a thin Lucite-like rim. On, it has a thin, black frame around the picture with the Lucite-like edge and a single, red LED showing power on at the bottom.  The only other things on the front are the remote and C.A.T.S. sensors (not really visible). The power on light is clearly visible, but doesn't distract from the picture (to me)-The screen seems to be very low reflectance which is nice as that would distract from the pictureMinuses-The brightness does seem to  be a challenge for me.. I would love to use the \"C.A.T.S.\" which is supposed to auto-adjust brightness and contrast as your room light changes, but it is just inadequate.. especially as it doesn't balance for light behind the tv (ie a window or whatever). It might be fine if you wall-mount it, but I didn't try that. Instead I have to adjust the contrast, brightness, or backlight now and then.. not difficult, but does require navigation through several buttons each time.-The remote requires detailed entry for channel navigation.. this is annoying. My old remote acted like your browser which would fill in options as you type and you could hit enter anytime saving a LOT of button pushing. As an example you have only one channel starting with a \"2\".. enter the 2 and that was all needed as it auto-completed the only entry.. or if you had 4 channels that started with a \"3\".. when you put the \"3\" in an onscreen menu would appear and you could \"arrow\" up or down to the one you wanted. This remote has little on-screen help and you must laboriously type every digit.edit: If you have selected a list of \"favorites\", the favorites button will call up a list of those and you may arrow up/down or punch the number of the item on the list (3 pages, 0-9 up to 30 channels) This does help.-The \"info\" given for my old tv adapter would show program info for current and next program across all channels.. this is only for current and only the one being watched.. this forces me to consult a tv listing a lot more than I had to before.. an inconvenience-The remote \"cursor control\" is surrounded with other buttons and in the dark by feel it is easy to hit wrong buttons.. seems this could have been more ergonomically done-Remote is not lighted in any way-The set on the back, right side has manual \"input, channel up/down, volume up/down and power on/off buttons. If your remote isn't working or you're standing by the set, I suppose you could use these.. They are \"blind\".. i.e. you can't see them from the front, but have to go by feel. They also are a good hand's reach in from the edge. When you touch one, it puts a menu un the screen, near the buttons (they don't line up however!.. lol) Would be usable in a pinch, though; and I expect that's just what they're for.-It would be nice if some kind of elementary browser were built in.. given that even cell-phones do this now, it doesn't seem to ask muchFinally, with respect to my objectives, I'll be saving over 4kw-hrs PER DAY on electric (about $12 a month) and have a very flexible, enjoyable tv as well.

For the price it has an excellent picture.However, there is a reason that Panasonic is on the ropes as a company.  Here are two reasons.1. Packing of the TV could have been done better a kinder-gardener.  I was warned by other reviewers that the packing was poor.  It is almost non-existent.  So, while it is a great TV, it is hit or miss as to whether it will arrive in tact.  I have PRIME, and being forewarned, I ordered one-day shipping as I figured the fewer times it had to be handled by the shipper the better.  I hardily recommend one-day shipping if you are still willing to take the chance with a TV that will be rattling around inside the packaging when received.2. The power cord was missing.  The box was completely in tact, so the factory missed putting in the power cord.  No biggie, except that I am dealing with a company that is in dire straights.  The customer service Rep was so paranoid that I would be trying to steal a power cord from them that she went through a very thorough security type of investigation into whether I was a legitimate owner.  Was I the real owner of the TV?  Was it mine rather than a gift? What was the serial number (on the back of a wall mounted TV - unmount TV retrieve serial number, remount TV)?  Oh, too new to be a real serial number. Can I send in the receipt?  We are talking a 1 hour process to receive the power cord that was not in the box.  Then I was told that it would 4-6 weeks to receive the power cord.  So much for having my TV in time for Christmas.  What I should have done and may still do is buy the power cord from Amazon for $4.50 with two day shipping.You need to be a bit of a risk taker to buy this otherwise excellent TV.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture limited inputs", "Author": "Richard Graves \"photo reader\"", "ReviewID": "RKYO4J70PL2QJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This set was easy to assemble and get running.

I am a photographer, and I notice when things aren't right with a picture.  In particular, I notice when blacks aren't really a true black in a television screen.  Here is what I am seeing when watching this television:Once I had this set up and all adjustments properly made on it, I can see perfect brightness, saturation, contrast and sharpness of colors.  Colors are vivid but not overly loud as they can be on some other well known brands, that oversaturate.  In particular, I notice skin tones and faces. The skin tones are soft and natural looking without any uneven or harsh areas.Many televisions have a blurring that occurs when watching a movie.  Panasonic has corrected that tendency here by smoothing images out with additional frames.  Panasonic says it displays images with 96 frames instead of the original source 24-frame sequence.  I can tell you, it works.  There is zero blur while watching movies on this set.As far as aesthetics goes, this is a pretty television.  It is basic looking, uncluttered, and does not seem to pick up fingerprints easily.  The stand is attractive and unobtrusive.  It has a matte black screen when off so that it doesn't pick up glare from our bright sunny room that we have it in, which was important to me.I love this set and it is delivering a great picture and movie watching experience.

It isn't a perfect device, but it isn't a poor purchase either.Good:1) The picture quality is excellent. I will admit forthrightly that I am not an audio/video junkie. I would be hard pressed to talk about the depths of black and how vibrant colors appear, but for my part, I like the picture.2) It communicates with my home theater (also by Panasonic) very well, as it should.3) It is well-built, with a metal stand and back panel.Bad:1) I don't know if this is the fault of Panasonic, Amazon, or FedEx, but the tv arrived with a dent in the ventilation screen in the back. Not going to affect performance, and it is on the back so you can only see it when you are arranging cables, etc, but after paying this much money for a brand new television it would be nice if it arrived in new condition.2) There are no optical cable hookups. I have a Nintendo wii, and I can't use it because the television only has a plethora (x4) of HDMI ports. I had to buy an HDMI converter to use my wii with this television (which hasn't arrived from Amazon yet, so I don't even know if it will work). You'd think they could include at least one port to connect the little white/red/yellow cables that come from older devices like VCRs, the wii, etc.3) The sound from the television itself isn't on par with the picture. This was complicated by the fact that it took me a while and some frustration before I figured out how to get the sound to play through my home theater (make sure the HDMI cable for the player is plugged in the second HDMI port on the tv that says \"ARC\" underneath it). Again, my home theater negates this, but if you don't have one or you can't figure out how to work it at first, you get less than awesome sound.Overall, I don't regret my purchase, and it was nice to not have to figure out how to get it home from the store and/or get hassled by the people trying to up-sell their expensive featured junk at a brick-and-mortar store.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality but some minor disappointments", "Author": "DevilSmith", "ReviewID": "R11Z5ON53L755", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV has great picture quality, it is thin, elegant, and easy to use.

However, there was no damage to the TV inside. This TV is so much crisper and clearer than my old one. The wife has commented several times on how sharp the images are. The older black and white TV shows really pop. The sound is on the weak side(probably a common deficiency with newer TV's)...it sounds monotone. I do have a surround sound system to use during movies though. Set up was very easy and quick. Bonuses...I won't have anymore repair costs to a convergence board (my old TV), and with an Energy Guide estimate of only $11/yr, I think this one will pay for itself before it needs replacing.

It's a mixed bag, in my opinion. I have the following to say, starting with the good news first.Pros:-Compared to other models I've looked at in this size/price range, this thing has the most inputs. 4 HDMI, 2 USB, SD, coax, ethernet, even a VGA. It only has one split-personality component/composite jack, but that's par for the course these days.-One I fiddled with the settings, I agree with the Amazon folks. Bright and colorful things look bright, colorful, and sharp.-You can have multiple picture presets. Being able to separate my game settings from Roku settings is a great thing.-Soap Opera Effect is fully adjustable between the aforementioned presets. Never fear.-There's an easy setup process that it mercifully allows you to skip if you're not using Smart TV features.Cons:-Absolutely atrocious black levels and backlight bleeding (or pressure marks maybe?) from the corners during dark scenes. Turning the energy saving mode to \"Saving\" and turning the backlight down even further helps quite a bit. The uneven blacks reminds me of the \"fog\" those old rear-projection TVs generated. Not a deal breaker, but I'm not happy about it.-The presets that come with the TV are garbage, adjust them before passing judgement. It does get better.-The shiny glossy screen finish is annoying if you have windows in the room.-The packaging was terrible. The box looked like it'd been dragged around and punched. The punch damage was on the screen side, but thankfully the blow didn't connect with the TV inside the box. I do have a couple of dents in the back of my unit, but I don't think the internals were harmed.Not cons, but you should be aware of these and prepare accordingly:-This is a Smart TV, but NO WIFI. From what I can tell from other reviews, the built in apps suck anyway. Buy a Roku, it's the same price as a wifi dongle for this TV and probably has better features.-No analog audio output for my old stereo system (optical only), but again, I think that's par for the course. Crisis averted: I bought a $30 DAC that converts the optical jack to the RCA I need. Just make sure you pick stereo mode, not Dolby/surround on your appliances. Analog input from my Wii passes through the digital out just fine, in case you were worried about that.-I am not taking the built-in sound into consideration. I just assumed a flat panel would sound crappy and immediately routed to my stereo receiver.Conclusion:If I were to do it all again, I would see if there was another model with a better picture in the same price range. I have a feeling a plasma would've been the better choice. The biggest flaw is the cloudy blacks. It's terrible, but it's really not worth returning it over. The TV is great otherwise.

This was when I came across the deal in Amazon for the \"Panasonic VIERA TC-L42E50 42-Inch 1080p Full HD IPS LED-LCD TV\" and the great reviews for this model. I went for the deal, blindly believing in the reviews and I was not disappointed. The following are its standout features:1. LED screen with IPS panel: The TV is quite slim and the picture clarity is awesome right out of the box. Because of the IPS panel, you can watch it from a wide angle without any loss of clarity.2. Viera Connect: Though the TV does not support wifi connectivity, just connect a ethernet cable and you are all set. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Huluplus come right out of the box. You can also configure Facebook, Twitter and Google Picasa. Just login to Picasa and you can watch all your photo albums right on TV. You wouldn't need a Roku/Apple TV.3. Sound: The sound is powerful enough for a small living room unless you want your eardrums to break. If you are an audiophile and look for a theater effect, then I suggest you buy a separate sound system. Otherwise, the default sound will suffice.4. 120 Hz: Seriously, this is one of the most overrated features of TVs these days. The TV is set to run at 120 Hz right out of the box, and you can actually notice the difference - the soap opera effect. So, I actually turned it off. Maybe you might need it for sports and animated movies.

Now for service. More than 5 years ago I purchased a 42 inch Panasonic plasma tv which has a beautiful picture. After 4 years it developed a problem. I telephoned Panasonic. Even though it was more than 3 years out of warranty, they sent a repairman who diagnosed a $300 plus repair. Panasonic paid the charge and the television now works like new (perfect). This was the only Panasonic product which ever failed in ANY manner, and Panasonic fixed it for nothing. I will continue to buy Panasonic products. Skip the junk.

It's a \"dumb\" set, lacking any apps or internet connectivity, but I have always been satisfied with the picture quality.The best way to summarize the picture quality on this TV is this - If a person is used to watching LED/LCD displays, the picture on this set is probably just fine.  But if a person is used to watching plasma displays (especially higher-end ones like Panasonic or Pioneer), they will probably be disappointed with the picture.  In general, the set simply can't display the black levels, detail and colors that make plasma displays the gold standard and so pleasing to watch.  It's not that the picture quality on this set looks poor, in fact with high-quality source material and some setting-tweaking the picture can be quite pleasing.  But with poorer source material (Netflix and some other streaming services) the picture quality suffers, especially if you aren't a fan of the 'Soap Opera Effect' (more below).  At the end of the day the set lacks the black levels, detail and \"pop\" of PDPs, so if you are shopping for a great picture above all else, you are probably better off looking at Panasonic's plasma line (We just returned this set and ordered the Panasonic TC-P55S60 as a replacement, for example).Some more thoughts on the set if the above paragraph didn't scare you away:With higher-quality source material the picture quality on this set is nice, what I'd call a \"B\" or so.  I had a chance to watch 'Prometheus' on BD, 'The Dark Knight Rises' on BD and 'Django Unchained' on Vudu [HDX], and in all three cases the set provided a nice picture, if a bit light on the black levels and overall color.  The picture was smooth, clear and detailed.  In fact I would have probably kept the set if the picture quality with poorer-quality source material didn't suffer so badly.  I watched two or three older (ca. 2000) episodes of \"Law & Order: SVU\" on this set using Netflix streaming and was disappointed with the picture quality.  What I observed while using this set is that turning the Motion Picture Setting (MPS) to \"Strong\", which enables the highest-degree of the controversial \"Soap Opera Effect\", also yielded the best picture.  For some, this won't be a problem.  Personally?  I don't like the SOE, and would prefer to keep it set to \"Off/Weak\" at all times.  Unfortunately, doing so with this set means watching a picture that is grainier/less detailed than when having the MPS on strong, and that is a compromise that I was unwilling to make (you may feel differently).  Additionally, there was a chase scene on SVU (with MPS set to \"Strong\") which caused the set to exhibit some pretty strong judder/jaggie tendencies, which is more of an annoyance than anything else.  I assumed that the issue with with the set, not the source material, as we've watched hundreds of hours of Netflix streaming content on my current 50\" PDP and always been extremely happy with the picture quality; black levels, details, color and fidelity have always been great.  On the other hand, my wife watched 10 minutes or so of \"Glee\", streamed via Hulu, and the picture quality seemed fine, on par for what I saw with the BD/Vudu experience.  This might be related to the native format of the content, and I'm not an expert in that so I won't weigh in.  But for serious buyers who understand these things I would advise making sure that the content you want to watch on this set will display acceptably for you.  If you like watching older shows/films, I cannot recommend this set.Features-wise, the set is very nice, with a handsome design, 4X HDMI ports (side-mounted instead of back-mounted, which I really like), and all of the Smart TV bounses.  If you aren't a stickler for PQ the set is very nice looking with very good connectivity.  But if you are looking for \"A\" level PQ, I unfortunately cannot recommend this set.I hope that this helps some of you shopping for a new TV.EDIT: 4/27/2013.The set we ordered as a replacement for the TC-L55E50, the TC-P55S60 (plasma), showed up this morning.  After a few hours of so of watching a few different sources (Again, \"TDKR\" on BD and some Netflix/Hulu content), I can absolutely say that the PQ on the S60 is superior to the E50.  The black levels on the S60 are remarkably deep for the price (Amazon has it for around $1K), and overall it is simply a better picture.  Other nice things about the S60 are the built-in WiFi and Hulu/Vudu/Nexflix/AmazonOD apps, the styling and the picture adjustments.  Bad things are the highly reflective screen and just 2x HDMI ports.  I thought that the lack of HDMI ports would be a problem, until I realized that I didn't even need to hook up the Roku anymore because the set has all of the apps for which we use the Roku, anyway.  Overall, the S60 is a very nice set for anybody looking for a comparable replacement to the E50 in terms of price and screen size.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy with purchase", "Author": "Rocky", "ReviewID": "R3I3LARCAEJ52K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Couldn't be happier with this tv.

It took me a few minutes to figure out how to assemble the base (there is a hook that base has to go over)Once assembled everything worked great, except the sound. I had a 32\" CRT with great sound and I couldn't even hear the TV across the room. But I expected this TV and other LED TVs to have bad sound.Initially I didn't have any HDMI cables so I used the PC input (VGA) and component audio.  Note the VGA input does not support 1080p I think it was around 720p but I forgot what I ended up setting it to.The \"Smart TV\" features are pretty slow. Easy to use but slow, and I kept hitting them on the remote. BTW when in the smart mode your source button doesn't work you have to press X first a bit annoying. I used a wired connection and had no problems (worked seamless)The on screen help is pretty sweet and a very nice feature. Along with the ability to disable and name input sources.I got Samsung HW-E450 Wireless AirTrack Sound Bar and connected it with a HDMI cable using ARC. After a bit of configuration I got it working great, with the TV remote power button turning the sound bar and TV off and on.The 4 HDMI ports are really nice, however I wish there was more composite inputs, the only way to input audio is composite audio, (and if it is included in a HDMI connection like xbox).  I am using a DVI to HDMI cable with composite audio in for my computer and that takes up 2 input sources. The HDMI does support full 1080p.  The composite input needs an included adapter which is ugly and could be easily lost in a move.To get my computer to display correctly you have to adjust the picture settings to size 2, with eliminates the overscan so you can see the full screen.The remote is pretty nice and easy to use, with the exception hitting the internet button too much by accident.The Picture quality is good,  Halo 4 looked sooo good! But dark scenes don't come out so great. I had no issues with viewing angle. My guess is that other more expensive TVs look nicer, but for a budget TV its pretty good.I don't really like the picture presets and its not clear how to turn 120hz off, I think game mode will do that. Speaking of which I still don't understand whats up with changing the title of the product. Its not true 120hz Refresh Rate but it defiantly processes the single because I see the soap opera effect.There are ads displayed in the volume control but its super easy to turn it off.Overall it seems like it has the most inputs for its class and a nice set of easy to use well working features.

E50 uses an not-so-common 400x400 wall mount pattern that makes it hard to upgrade from existing older mounts.there is some confusion regarding the refresh rate . I think the confusion is caused by E5 being 60hz and E50 being \"most likely\" 120hz. Look at the backlight scanning spec. backlight scanning = refresh rate X number of sections. so 360 translates to 120 X 3. Both ET5 and E50 's backlight scanning spec out as 360 while WT50 specs as 1920 (240 x 8).So regardless the refresh rate, I am happy with the TV.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "In credible", "Author": "Patrick T.

To date, this still beats other prices.  I like to buy my TVs from Sears in person and inspect the box before I take it home.  Sears did not have this TV in stock.  Compared to other smart TVs, this is cheap - especially with the $100 promotional from Amazon.Risky Shipping WarningI ordered the TV (new) on a Sunday evening and received it on Tuesday Morning via UPS.  The box by Panasonic was sturdy (unlike the thin boxes used by Sony).  However, this box had several small poked holes in it, two big surface cuts, and looked like it went through a bad conveyer belt.  Looked like original tape/sealing was on it.  When opening from the top I noticed the tape was broken, pressed in, and someone could have put their hand in the box.  The Styrofoam had been broken, pushed to the side.  I think this put 3 marks on the screen that I thought I wiped away with a tissue, but which appeared later (not seeable when TV is on).  There was also a scuff mark on the back metal piece.  Either the Amazon warehouse or the UPS guys messed the box up.  ***Amazon ships this in the original TV box.***TV Can Survive the ShippingThankfully, the TV works great.  Where the three lines were/are located on the right corner - I do not notice them anymore (but they're still there) when the TV is off or on.  No backlit bleeding like other reviewers mentioned.  Black tones look fine (comparing to my Sony 32 inch LCD).  I noticed some choppiness when people were running on an Amazon Prime show (digital HD), but it may have just been because of the particular British show from a few years ago and/or my lack of fine-tuning settings.  Also, I've never had a TV this big.  Animation looks phenomenal on this TV.  While flipping channels, a Batman Beyond episode from 1999 was on the HUB HD channel.  It looked very sharp.  I have not watched any sports on it yet.Four HDMI ports on this TV - hard to beat that in this price range!Ethernet Cable for Internet ConnectionInternet to the TV is via the Ethernet cable from the modem (pulled it from the tower).  I am still able to surf the web, and use my computer, on the TV as a monitor.  Either the TV is allowing this because of the HDMI between the TV and tower or maybe the wireless in the desktop finally started working?Amazon Prime Instant VideoShows I watched were in HD and looked great.  Linking to Amazon should only take a few minutes.Video GamesWii video games (Metal Slug, etc.) look great on the TV.  I have not hooked up the Xbox yet.  I also played Age of Empires 2 (computer game) on the big screen and it looked very nice.Computer via HDMI ConnectionI hooked my computer/tower via HDMI cable to the TV.  Use the remote (navigate the settings) to fix your desktop resolution being too large for the screen.  You can surf the net from your couch (I boosted the browser page view to 150% and the text to \"Larger\").  This eliminates some white-space while not losing any words.  You need to still have good eyes or glasses for this as well.OtherThe TV is actually kind of heavy I think (especially compared to a Sony LCD).  The back of the TV feels and sounds like a flimsy piece of thin metal.  It also heats up to be quite hot.So Far So GoodBasically:-Shipping is risky but worth it!-TV picture is sharp in my opinion-TV is a great buy for the price-Probably a good fit for you unless you must have Sony specifications (more $$$)-Perfect for streaming Amazon Prime Instant media-Perfect for surfing the web from your living room-Hard to find a TV with 4 HDMIs in this price rangeUPDATE 2/2/13Some people are saying the TV is 60 hrz and not 120 as advertised.  I have to check my box.  I did not notice when watching some football that the refresh rate was not as good as my older Sonys.  This still may be adjustable.  Overall, I'm still satisfied with the TV.POMOTION ISSUES with AmazonAmazon offered a $100 promo to be sent within 7 says of product shipping (excluded tablets and I think Apple products).  Amazon told me wait up to 7 says from shipping.  It still didn't come at 9 days.  Customer service said and gave me a code that needed to be \"Activated\" by Marketing department.  So I had to wait another day.  I got another code that did not work.  I called for a third time, at this point (approx 1/31/13) this product was taken off the Amazon website and would not  come up when I clicked on my own previous review of it (Today, 2/2/13, it is back).  On this third call, Amazon tried to tell me the $100 promo was only for certain products and not the books sold by amazon in my cart.  This was incorrect b/c the promo covered books and products held by and sold by Amazon, except for tablets, etc.  At this point Amazon told me they would just rebate me a $100.  The next day I had a payment option that went up to a $100.Amazon customer service told me at various times the promo was only for  digital products or not what was in my cart (books mainly).

At the outset, I will mention that I am loyal fan of Panasonic, having owned many of their products over the years, including a ten-year-old boom box and a 25-year old VCR that still works!  Now on to the E50 . . .First, the good.  This television produces wonderful images for ordinary daytime scenes.  Color is natural.  Movement is handled well - even without the motion smoothing, which you can turn off by going into Game Mode.  I did this to eliminate the unfortunate \"soap opera\" effect created by motion smoothing (which makes the image look like cheaply shot video).  Also, the menu is intuitive and easy to navigate.  There are plenty of in and outputs -- although analogue audio would have been a nice addition.Now for the bad.  Like most LED TVs, this Pany has trouble reproducing good black levels in darker scenes.  You don't really notice this in daylight scenes.  But in night scenes, this model spills irregular blotches of light across the screen.  This is true even with backlighting set at zero.  Detail is lost and contrast is muddied.  If you are a cinema lover as I am, you may find this very distracting.  I probably should have done more due diligence here, as this problem seems endemic to most edge-lit sets.The upshot is this.  I traded in E50 for the Panasonic plasma 50ST50.  Although it was more expensive, the images on the ST50 are drop-dead gorgeous, and I'm glad I made the switch.

I was impressed, though realized that the video was bumped way up for sales floor viewing.

Some will complain about the Soap Opera effect but you get used to that (it is the same on my 70\" sharp). Note: you will want to change some settings to your preferences. For example I turned off the setting that checks the ambient light in the room and dims the TV to save power. This made the TV terrifically bright which I prefer. I watch sports and TV shows on it and am thrilled with what I see. You will want HDTV programming because SD looks awful by comparison.>Amazon instant video is available on this TV with no external device. Just connect it to your wired or wireless internet (both are built into TV) and you can watch any Amazon show you want. If you have purchased movies or TV in the past, all of your purchased shows are there. If you are a prime customer, you can watch free prime videos. Much better than using the cable company VOD. I use the wired connection which is very fast. Don't know if the wireless will work as fast.>Smart TV works with many other internet services like Netflix or Hulu plus.>Beautiful design. Though it doesn't show well in the pictures, the TV has a clear plastic frame around the outside edge. Sounds cheap (and probably is) but looks almost art deco and very cool. The black bezel is no more than an inch wide. I prefer the ones with no bezel but they are dramatically more expensive and this looks great.>Plenty of HDMI inputs plus a VGA computer input. It only has one input of the old fashion RCA component or composite (can be used for either but only has one). If you have HDMI, this will not be a drawback.>Because the TV is thin, it actually weighted about the same as the Samsung that was 10 inches smaller. I was able to mount it on the same VESA mount (by purchasing adapter plates on amazon).Cons:>the big one is the sound is not that loud. I am a little hard of hearing and that bothers me a little bit. Apparently most of the new LED TVs in this size range are meant to be used with home theaters so they put cheap laptop speakers in them. If you have normal hearing, it probably won't bother you. Even in my case, when I turn it to 100% volume, it is almost too loud, but at 100% it should be ear splitting. I solved buying a very small home theater for my bedroom and now the sound is great. I downgraded to four stars based on the fact that the volume wasn't that loud but with the stereo it is a 5 star TV for me.>power cable is proprietary. This meant I couldn't use the standard computer monitor cable I had run through the wall, but for $2 I bought an adapter on Amazon that solved the problem by converting my computer cable to a standard wall type socket.I am not an audiophile or a videophile but I would not accept anything less than a beautiful picture and this has it.

Yes, Amazon has a chart on their site - but most people do not order their tvs of this size through the mail and do not have time to do a mountain of research on terminology. . .what's worse - in my opinion Panasonic is misusing accepted professional lingo! In the A/V business \"wireless ready\" generally means the equipment only needs a wireless network. In our brave new age of consumer exploitation where manufacturers can apparently say whatever they please, Panasonic has stamped a huge picture of a wireless signal on the box for this TV with wireless ready written on it. There is no chart from Amazon in most local or box stores to pick through how Panasonic decides to misuse professional terminology, nor should there need to be.

In the past they were one of my favorite companies. Some of their plasma TVs could not be beat (as far as plasmas go). In my opinion, this TV would have been spectacular in picture quality five or six years ago and still pretty useful \"as is\" - mechanically - six or more years ago when fiber optic cable lines were still widely used in homes. That Panasonic has this priced where it is, is advertising it in stores as \"wireless ready\" and apparently set up its firmware so it will not allow any other wireless adapter (including not working with the, in my opinion, rubbish adapters they required people buy for wireless service with some of their older generation blu-ray players), is ridiculous.If you have ethernet cabling instead of wireless in your house I would say this TV can meet your needs - but - should you support a product marketed in a way that seems, to me at least, meant to mislead the consumer? I have many other Panasonic products that have been great, but this is grey area marketing that is extremely poor. When we support it, we encourage more of it. Panasonic knows most people struggle mightely installing a TV. Many people have to hire a pro. Who is going to take this TV back once they realize it isn't wireless?. . .Only people with the time and knowledge to unhook it, transport it, and install a new one. My guess is Panasonic is unfortunately banking on that, and banking on the fact that consumers will then line up like sheep to buy the adapter they make (the only specific one that appears to work), in order to utlize the features they paid for, but cannot use.We have three (yes, overkill I know) surround systems in our home. I installed all of them and several others as well. I have compared and utilized many brands of TVs - though I am not a professional installer. I have seen this model alongside a 42\" $500 60htz JVC. I felt the JVC produced better blacks. This Panny's blacks are somewhat washed out, even after adjustment, and reminded me of some of Samsung's lower end offerings - though the other hues of color reproduction are quite good. Well, they should be, right? The $500 JVC's looked good too. There is another review for this TV where some consumer is rudely making fun of someone for buying a Vizio. Well, the Vizio owner probably got a better performing TV for the money.At any rate, I tried this set in one of our rooms anyway, mostly because I like Panasonic. It was OK. . .but OK isn't good enough for this price point, and I was still disappointed by their choice of marketing strategy. Back to the store it went. . .and I am happy I returned it, because the replacement is a lot better. I bought a LG 47LM6400 for roughly what this TV could have cost (depending on where you buy it) if I had purchased it and the ridiculous wireless adapter. The LG also has 3D, which I do not really care about - but if you want 3D I mention it to show there are options at the same price point with 3D and other features the Panny lacks out of the box and the LG of course has built in Wi-Fi. What's ironic is the LG isn't even especially clear on the box that it has wireless built-in. The LG's blacks are much richer. The overall color reproduction is better. The web interface is better. The remote is better, although the Panny remote had a sturdier feel. The TV seems constructed better. I am not saying buy the LG, I am just pointing out you can get more features and (in my opinion) better performance for roughly what this Panny will cost you once you add in the wireless adapter. If you are shopping different models you can find comparison reviews at the site \"Digital Trends.\" LG's 6700 series (6400 is a virtually identical new model) scored a 9/10. They are a bit gentler on the Panny than CNET. . .they reviewed a 42\" from the same series and give it a 7.5/10.The biggest issue for me with this Panasonic, mechanically, was its HD picture quality in dark scenes, which I was not satisfied with. I am also very disappointed that Panasonic engaged in what I consider deceptive marketing.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great T.V.", "Author": "USCSW2010", "ReviewID": "R2ITWICGQ86QTI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this t.v. for my husband.

Before you get too far into my review I will mention I have had a few other HDTV's in the last 8 years so I have a decent understanding of the different technology the companies use and have used, I build tube guitar amps and while any modern tv is much more complex I have a basic understanding of how things in these tv's work. I was really impressed by the picture quality on this set in general. I was real happy for the first 30 minutes or so until I gave it the test of turning out the lights and seeing how it performed in the dark. Again in general the picture quality was excellent as long as the content was bright, the first few darker scenes however I noticed some areas were not as dark as others not only around the edges but in the innerparts of the screen as well. I immediatley suspected mura (clouding) as the problem. So I decided to try a input with no signal, I really was surprised how bad the clouding was. A couple of the areas were hand sized and others more band like, one vertical on the left side of the screen and a horizontal one in the upper right center part of the screen.Obviously I was more than a little bit unhappy to see this. I calibrated the set and got it much better when in standard mode but they were still easily visible in all the other modes- to be noted though only in a dimly lit or dark room. I really could not see the problem with all the lights in the room on. I realized it was going to continue to bother me anytime I viewed without the lights on and decided to return the set this morning and got a 50\" UT series Panasonic plasma today which seems to be awesome just like my old 42\" Panasonic plasma was. I will review the new 50\" plasma TV seperately in the appropriate location here soon once I have a bit of time for a thorough review.I do not intend in any way to turn anyone away from this model. I just do know for a fact that LCD panels are still prone to mura, flashlighting and picture frame light leakage- google lcd+ any one of those 3 terms if you want a quick education on what it is and the possible causes. Some models in the past have been really prone to it and hopefully not many owners of this model experience what I did, Honestly I think 9 out of 10 people would not notice as quickly or care as much as I do, especially in a moderately or well lit viewing area. However I simply expect a consistent picture. I am happy with plasma so I'll leave this issue at that.I also find the 120 hz causes the \"SOE- soap opera effect\" - this drives me crazy. If you like this effect you might be into it. You can turn it off or the weak motion setting was not too bad. Also game mode disables this function, where basically the tv draws in the extra frames- any progressive scan content whether it be 480p 720p or 1080p is 60 frames per sec, which is pretty much 60hz in general. So the motion is artifically fluid at 120 hz. It really annoyed me. It looks real cool sometimes but it's just weird looking. You will notice it, whether you like it or not is a personal thing.Anyway The tv has a nice slim design. It also has a beautiful picture quality overall and the black levels are not too bad for lcd. I think Panasonic is trying to get into the lcd market and this is not a bad effort overall. I think the average person might not even notice the issues I had whether or not their set had or has them. Also The mura clouding thing is usually different with every set and probably a lot of folks got ones that are perfectly fine. It has plagued larger lcd's as long as I can remember. 4 years ago I went through 6 or more lcd's of the higher end brands and ended up with plasma. I see things have not changed all that much since then. I hope everyone who owns one of these is really enjoying theirs and not experiencing these problems. I'm just calling it like I see it.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Helpful Tips Before Ordering TV", "Author": "Katie M", "ReviewID": "R25UY3CJW9JZL7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my Panasonic VIERA TC-L47E50 47\" inch TV and I absolutely love it!  However, there are a few things I wish I had known prior to its arrival so the set up would have been faster.FYI: I have wireless Internet, but I do not have cable.  I only use the local, free prime time channels (NBC, CBS, ABC, etc.)Here's what happened...I get my Internet connection through the cable outlet in my living room wall.  A cable wire comes out of the wall and connects to the Internet router/modem box.  During the setup of the Panasonic TV it became apparent that I would need to attach a cable wire to the back of the TV to get it to retrieve channels.  However, the minute I detached the cable wire from the Internet router/modem the Internet stopped working (however, the TV did start to search for available channels).It became clear pretty quickly that I would need to obtain a cable splitter and also two additional cable wires.  I was able to drive to Target that night and pick up those 3 items for about $20.  When I got home I took the cable wire that was coming out of the wall and at the end of that I attached the splitter.  Then I attached the two cable bundles I bought to the two splitter openings on the other side of the splitter.  One cable then connected to the back of the TV and the other cable connected to the Internet router/modem.  Viola, everything worked!But wait, I still couldn't get the TV to connect to my wireless Internet connection and that is when I finally realized that the Panasonic VIERA TVs do not, I repeat, DO NOT have the wireless adaptor technology built into them.  If you want to have the TV connect to the Internet wirelessly, you have to purchase the Panasonic TY-WL2OU Wireless Adaptor for Panasonic 2012 Internet Ready TVs.  A quick search on Amazon and you'll find it.  It currently costs $52.50.  I read on a different review that you can't find this in a retail store so I wouldn't bother looking.  Just order it at the same time you order your TV on Amazon.  (You can also connect the TV to the Internet via an Ethernet cord, but I don't use them anymore.)When all was said and done, it was super simple to get everything hooked up.  It only took me longer than I had hoped because I didn't have the proper cable splitter/cords that my personal situation required AND I had to wait 2 additional days for the adaptor to arrive from Amazon.I read on someone else's review that the TV is a little cheaper than other comparable brands/models because it doesn't come with the wireless adaptor built in.  In total, I spent $739.99 on the TV, $52.50 on the adaptor and $20 for the extra materials at Target.  Just over $800 for a 47\" TV is a fantastic deal if you ask me!  I'd order it again in a heartbeat.If you are reading this and are still in your research phase for making a purchase know that if you are buying anything 40\" or above you need to make sure the unit has 120Hz.  Also, it was important for me that the TV is able to connect to Netflix, Amazon and HuluPlus and this one does.  Note: you cannot stream regular Hulu (even with a Roku box).  Hulu's rules are that only HuluPlus can be streamed.  If you rely heavily on Hulu, I'd recommend just signing up for HuluPlus and paying the $8/month.Lastly, there's a lot of chatter on the reviews about the Soap Opera Effect (SOP), but I've been watching not for 2 days and haven't noticed it at all, so I really think it just depends on the person.I think that's all I can think of for now.

The TV also looks attractive even when it's turned off.

That's right, unlike laptop manufacturers that figured out this neat trick ten years ago, Panasonic saw fit to ship an \"internet ready\" and \"Wifi ready\" (It says so on the box, \"Wifi Ready\")product that is actually not Wifi ready.Also, boo to Amazon for not making the wireless adapter a suggested product as other commenters have mentioned. By the way this adapter was backordered when I received my TV and realized it's shortcoming. Double boo.Due to the backorder at the time, I was inspired to make a workaround using an excellent product also available at Amazon, Diamond Multimedia 300Mbps 802.11n Wireless Range Extender (WR300N). As an added bonus this product is $10 cheaper than the Panasonic wifi adapter.Obviously, the Diamond Multimedia 300Mbps 802.11n Wireless Range Extender (WR300N) is a wifi range extender, meaning it is useful for filling out the dead or weak wifi spots in your home. I have had the good fortune of using this product for about a month prior to my purchase of this fine TV.Importantly, it can also be configured as a \"Wireless Ethernet Bridge\", a phrase that meant nothing to me until I had a fancy TV with a wired ethernet port, a router to connect it to the internet that happened to have a wall between it and the TV, and no apparent means of using decades old wireless technology as this was not included with the original purchase, a thought that still chaps me. Keep in mind, this TV requires a PROPRIETARY wifi adapter, shipped separately, don't even bother trying to use a generic USB wifi stick, they don't work on this.**No problem,** on a hunch, I took my Diamond WR300N, available from Amazon, reconfigured it to be a Wireless Ethernet Bridge as it is designed to do, connected it to my wifi signal, plugged it into the wired ethernet port on the back of my TV, and PRESTO, I now a wireless connected TV.Anyway, this workaround is no longer necessary as the proprietary Panasonic adapter is now available from Amazon for $10 more and probably requires less fiddling than I needed to do in its absence.

There was only 4 Styrofoam blocks on the 4 corners. No protection for the middle of the TV at all. Mine was actually bent when I received it (not as bad as the picture in the gallery). There were two large dents in the metal panel on the back as well.However, other than those issues the TV is a great value. I followed the settings listed in one of the reviews and it produced good picture. The settings are not what you would find in a \"Prosumer\" TV but they are enough that you can adjust it to your liking.Watched a Blu-ray and was blown away by how clear it was. I could see the textures of everyone's skin and the most minute details that weren't really apparent before.The sound is not bad. My Vizios sound was terrible, this one is much better. Although most of the time I am using a surround sound the TV sound is adequate.Video games are also very pleasing to the eye. Play something pretty like Crysis 3 and you will be able to see every single detail in the game. It is much more enjoyable than my Vizio.I used a French Cleat to hang it on my wall. It weighs about 40lbs and the French Cleat has no trouble keeping it in place. If you don't need a swivel mount then I would highly recommend getting a French Cleat mount. Super simple design, low profile, and extremely easy to install, it is also much cheaper than other mounts. I think I paid about $20 for it 4 years ago.If you don't know what it is, this is what it looks like. But do not pay $80 for one. You will have to find one off of Amazon.

Her previous TV was a 27 or 32 CRT Sharp.  Yikes.  After reviewing <42\" tvs for a couple days and experience purchasing a Panasonic 50\" Plasma mid summer...I decided to spring for the LED/LCD.  I spoke with some colleagues whose parents are now older in age...and they noted that they too have LCD or LED/LCD and love them.In truth, I was indecisive about this and a Samsung product that Cnet had praised for value and performance.  There were reviews on amazon that depending what the serial number was, the glass was a much lower quality.  I dismissed the Samsung idea immediately to avoid that 1% chance of unfortunate circumstances.The extra features: Wireless capable/Apps, 2HDMI...all that great stuff didn't affect my decision so much as the quality of the product.  Luckily Best Buy had this item on display and I turned off the surrounding TVs to focus on this one.  Coincidentally the Samsung was very close and I found the picture less subtle.I purchased this last year just before Christmas while it was on sale ($548) and paired it with the  SEI Thomas Corner Media Stand, Black.  It was a blockbuster hit.  Her living area is very bright due to several windows in the open kitchen/living room area.The picture shows well but still gets washed out...I don't recall modify the settings very much.  She has a comcast cable box running to the TV and it works without any problem.  The sound I noticed you do have to turn very high...which others have noted and is a common problem with all new TVs. The 10w/20w speakers are not the best but serve their purpose in this case.

Before purchasing I saw the set in person at BestBuy compared to several others in the same price range, and several substantially higher in price. For the most part it displays true to life colors and contrast, and for some shows/movies it's a little off. This can be easily fixed with a little tweaking in the picture settings. I highly recommend disabling the \"soap opera\" setting if you are also bothered by the added frames (menu>picture>advanced picture settings>motion picture effect>off). The features are intuitive to change inputs, use media mode for USB attachments, and it streams from NetFlix and Amazon Video flawlessly with HD quality.There is a discrepancy with the refresh rate. 120Hz is the generally recognized value for the set, but other websites list the refresh at 60Hz. Having seen the TV side by side with both 120 and 240Hz sets, I can confidently say that this is clearer (no blur in fast-action scenes) than other 120Hz, and almost as nice as some of the 240Hz sets. Really an excellent value for the money!My only complaint was the packaging. It was shipped in the commercial box from Panasonic and arrived looking like it had fallen off the truck. Both sides were crushed, ripped, and there were holes torn into side where the screen rests. The molded styrofoam had been crushed into pieces, so the TV was free to move around in the box.

First of all, this one which has a larger screen yet is still much thinner and lighter than the LG Plasma.  It also does not raise the room temperature by several degrees like the plasma did!  It has a beautiful look to it and the design is very sharp.The picture is bright and clear with vivid colors. The remote is easy to use and the TV has lots of functionality.  The wide viewing angle makes it perfect for use in the family room since people can see it well from all of the seating areas. Sports look great on the screen and the HD picture is incredibly clear.  It makes for great slide shows to show vacation photos too using either the SD Card or USB ports! Set up was easy and took very little time.The only downside is the sound (which others noted) and which could be clearer and louder. This is the only reason I didn't give the TV 5 stars.  I think that speakers which are located in the back of the TV like the Panasonic's are don't project as well nor sound as good as TVs that have them in the front.

I did not purchase this with the highest expectations for picture quality and understood that it was not a high-end model. This TV fits my needs very nicely as a mid-range LED TV.The thin design of the TV is very nice and has a low profile when mounted on my wall. The picture quality is not bad and has nice viewing angles.Our only complaints about this TV are:1. Sound Quality - we knew that the speakers in LED TVs are weak so we expected this when purchasing the TV. Poor quality sound is just par for the course when it comes to LED TVs since bigger speakers cannot be packed into the thin design of LED TVs.2. Very glossy screen - the glossy screen was somewhat surprising. I saw a few other reviews that mentioned this aspect and did not think much of it. Where the TV is mounted in our living room we can easily get glare from multiple windows and lights. I originally had the picture settings changed to have lower brightness but I tweaked the settings a bit to help reduce how noticeable the glare is. With a brighter backlight setting the glare is not as noticeable but it is still annoying.All of that being said, this is a great TV for the price I paid. Landing a 47\" LED TV for under $550 is a great deal. I cannot complain about a mid-range TV and compare to high-end units that would cost over $1k.

Instead of sending out the TV in the correct size, they offered first a refund of $85 for the lost remote, Then they were going to offer me that refund to keep the TV, remote and all. THEN, they wanted it sent back, they would refund me, then I could order another one WHAT THE HECK - NOT the customer service I've come to know at Amazon.This went on so long, I decided to keep the TV and buy a new remote ($50) and all they did was refund me $100 (which was really just $50 and told me it's the best they could do because it came from Warehouse Deals and not Amazon directly, to which I responded, Amazon's name is on it, so should their customer service.So save yourself the heartache, the constatnt back and forth of emails, the lack of being able to call Amazon direct etc etc and just buy a new one, you'll be SO happy you did cuz the TV ROCKS MY BALLS OFF!", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV MUST GET", "Author": "reggiereg41", "ReviewID": "R36852IZ118M0E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tv is everything I was looking colors are great as for gaming the picture it just a new experience.

I read the documentation for the TV online before purchase and thought it had a sufficient number of analog inputs for my needs, only to find that the two that they say they have share a common pigtail that plugs into a single jack on the TV.  If you have two analog machines to hook up to the TV, you still have to go behind the TV to plug in one or the other at a time if both are emitting a signal at the same time (or the two signals will mix).  It does have four HDMI inputs, though, and you can't have enough of those.  The analog machines I wanted to use don't have HDMI outputs, thus the need for multiple analog jacks on the TV.Update, two months later: I set up a wireless network and checked out the Smart TV features.  They include Skype.  Cool.  We can sit in the parlor and Skype from the sofa.  I got my webcam from my desktop and plugged it into the Viera and it couldn't be detected.  I went to the TV's help menu and discovered that only a Panasonic Viera CC20W Communicator Camera will work with this TV.  That's another $88 (from Amazon).  I am disappointed that this high-end TV would be so restrictive to Panasonic accessories.Update, two months after that:  I bought a Nexus 10 tablet.  I decided I wanted to stream Pandora from the tablet to my nice Panasonic TV.  Doesn't work.  The picture is there, but (after downloading an app called SoundAbout and enabling its sound settings for aux media (HDMI)) no sound comes out of the TV.  After much searching on the 'net and finding a lot of other people had the same problem, I found this:\"If you are planning to connect a Nexus 10 tablet to the TV video works fine but there is no audio. The same setup works with my Samsung TV and an older Panasonic TV but not this particular model. So I know there is nothing wrong with the tablet or HDMI cable or other settings. This is supposed to be plug and play. After researching this issue online there are many reports of this same problem with no audio on Panasonic TVs with Nexus 10. Sadly an answer from Panasonic was to make sure the audio setting was on digital. I can assure you that the problem is something other than this that is unique to this Panasonic model and Nexus combination. My media player works fine audio and video on this TV however. If connecting a Nexus 10 tablet to a TV is important for you you might want to look at other TV models.\"Since the TV has built-in YouTube, Netflix and Hulu, this isn't a real big deal, but I'm disappointed that these two high-end products are not compatible and neither Google nor Panasonic has seen fit to address it.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV!!!", "Author": "Michael Hodgdon", "ReviewID": "R2T6ZR7SCZ06TV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV!!

For the price I paid, I cannot complain too much, but its worth way more than the purchase price.Picture quality is great, bright where needed, dark where needed. Setup was quick and easy, but trying to access the setup menu for skipped steps later on was a bit confusing. Apps were nice, and video streaming was quick and easy. No issues here. Also no issues with packaging, it was good enough with foam at each corner and a few in between, with about 2 inches all around.The only downsides are that the usb ports are a bit too close together, even though I did not get the Panasonic wifi dongle, if I had, it would have been too wide and blocked the other one. A USB drive that I tried so far was average of size, smallest of the full ones without going to those micro ones, only allowed 1 to be plugged in at a time. Also, it does not come with a wifi dongle, and generic ones do not work. I ended up getting a wifi to ethernet converter and that works ok, since i'm able to use that on a different application if needed.I'll give it 5 stars anyway since the actual product is good and haven't had any issues yet.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Volume", "Author": "Michael Horn", "ReviewID": "R3E24V37DHBNLT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "TV is just great, no problems hooking up to Dish TV.

This was the case when I bought this TV off of Amazon.  A week prior to buying this TV, I went to my local big box store and picked up a 43\" Samsung Plasma.  I was sold on the idea of a plasma because I wanted a TV primarily to watch sports.  After watching the Samsung for 3-4 days I decided I was not happy with the picture quality and started checking for other options.  I ended up buying this TV from Amazon and I am completely sastisfied.  I currently have it hooked up through my PC in my man cave.  My man cave is a second bedroom so I sit quite close to the TV and I like this TV because of the 1080p resolution and the IPS technology.  It truly is a great TV for the money and I recommend it.

Good variety in connections: 4x HDMI, VGA in, Optical out, Ethernet, 2x USB, 1x SD and component/composite WITH A CAVEAT: it requires a small cable adapter.

I connected it to the internet via built in ethernet (wireless requires purchse additional adapter), and did a firmware update which went ok.Could be better:1. The TV will display ads!

To get optical out to my sound system will require a new purchase. So far I Y'ed my cable box audio output and sent that to my stero. With HDMI input there is a small audio sync noticed.

The Panasonic box and styrofoam is not great, but Adorama put the whole thing in a larger box with solid foam padding at each corner. Despite this special packaging, the internal Panasonic styrofoam cracked, and the box split open at the bottom when we tried to lift the box out of the Adorama box.TC L47E50 is mounted to Monoprice full - articulating, somewhat stiff-flexing wall mount.

Noticed the picture had \"refresh\" lines the scrolled up to top of screen when input was selected to cable.  I thought the TV was damaged but switched input to PS3 and Xbox 360 and the screen was clear and crisp.  I also purchased a Cyberpower UPS and hopefully that will \"cleanup\" the cable TV signal.  The smart TV function, Viera Connect, is slow and redundant as I have gaming consoles for Netflix.  The embedded TV Netflix app does work well in Viera Connect via fast ethernet cable.

(better than our new Sony!)", "Author": "BonJo", "ReviewID": "R3CFUIVLM1BENY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV is working great! Amazon is awesome!Overview:We bought two Sony 3D LED HDTVs the end of Oct 2012 from a local national brick-and-mortar store...a 46\" & 55\" KDL46HX750/KDL55HX750, respectively. The 55\" is working fine/the 46\" \"died\" around day 54 (THE WEEKEND BEFORE CHRISTMAS)- As soon as you power it up, it shuts off-turns back on-shuts off...then the red LED power light in the left blinks 8 times, pauses, blinks 8 times, pauses, etc.We immediately notified Sony. After having to repeat the problem to two different Sony reps. a replacement part has been \"ordered\" (they wouldn't tell us which part is defective). As of today (1/5/13) the TV just sits because \"the part\" has apparently not come in yet.How did we arrive at purchasing this Panasonic Viera TC-L42E50 42\" LED LCD TV (and yes, I also bought a 4 year square trade warranty)?The \"dead\" Sony is in our Den where we & guests view television or use the Wii the most. As a temporary fix, we moved the 6 year old 26\" RCA LCD TV from the downstairs bedroom/exercise room to the den while the Sony is out of commission. We've never really watched the RCA much, other than a few stations while on the treadmill, but it's really not a very good TV. It has two separate cable hook-ups: 1 for digital & 1 for analog (instead of sharing one) so you have to use a cable splitter. The Analog & Digital Stations are each viewable separately (you have to select \"input\" on the remote to go back and forth between the digital & analog) and many of the digital stations aren't even viewable (like CBS-only the analog channel 2 here in So. Calif comes up). The RCA is fine for videos/DVDs/games etc.It will make a good \"free\" TV for someone on Freecycle.That's how we ended up getting this Panasonic-since we have NO idea when the Sony will be, if ever, repaired, we decided to replace the RCA now to use in the den until the Sony is repaired or replaced by Sony, and we were definitely NOT going to get another Sony. My husband put me in charge of doing the research because HE'S the one who bought the two Sony's! LOLAfter spending 3 days of my vacation during Christmas/New Year's researching LED TVs (we really don't \"need\" 3d on this one but WiFi is imperative), I narrowed my selection down to this 42\" Panasonic (I acually wanted the 32\" but it wasn't 120hz so I went with the 42\"), a Samsung 32\" or 40\" LED, and an LG 32\" 3D LED TV. I was actually all set to get the LG 32\" 3D because for the same price as this Panasonic we could get the free 3D glasses to use with the Sony 3D TVs...UNTIL I realized the LG I was considering was not compatible with Amazon Prime Instant Video! (GASP!). That was the deal-breaker.I ordered this Panasonic & the WiFi adapter (Panasonic TY-WL20U)from Amazon on 1/1/13...they were sent out on 1/2/13...both arrived on 1/3/13! (dang...FAST is understating it!).The TV was inside the manufacturer's box that was inside an outer Amazon box so you couldn't tell exactly what was inside (Hey!...it could have been a large piece of artwork...LOL!). Taking up the space between the boxes are thousands (or so) very cool little triangular folded packing filler \"thingies\" (for lack of the correct name). We had never seen these in packing before but they worked great! They're rigid and don't allow much movement. Very Cool.As for this Panasonic (I know, but I'm almost done):In comparing the overall setup of this Panasonic to the two Sony's (that were manufactured around the same time-September 2012) the Panasonic has been a bit easier overall to set up, even though the Sony's have \"built-in WiFi\". For now, I've set up the WiFi adapter to connect straight to the wifi router upstairs (Linksys E3000 bought here on Amazon-factory refurb), but I just ordered a network repeater (Netgear refurb off Amazon) because this Panasonic will be going into the downstairs bedroom/exercise room and it's a bit of a stretch to expect a good signal in there. I have no problem with the external WiFi adapter because I figure, if the WiFi adapter ever bites the dust, it will be a heck of a lot easier to replace than the built-in WiFi adapter!...which I can do myself without calling Panasonic.The overall quality:So far, the overall quality of the Panasonic TV, remote, & viewing experience is on par with the Sony's, maybe even slightly better. I would even venture to say that the Panasonic's GUI of the Internet apps/marketplace, etc is a little more user friendly than the Sony's. I downloaded a couple of free game apps from the Panasonic Marketplace without any problems to an SD card that I inserted into the back of the TV.If anything changes from this point forward, I will update.***NOTE***I had a teensy bit of difficulty getting Netflix to setup, in addition to sporadic network connections the first couple of days after I set up the network connection.If you run into this, try this solution...Solution:Simply reset your TV to Default in the Setup area \"Set to Defaults\".Then just set up your network again (I'm using WPA2/AES on the TV and Auto IP Address. I also don't broadcast our router's SSID for security so I use the manual set up of the network connection). I was connected in seconds, including Netflix.If you Set to Defaults, Be sure to have the TV rerun finding all the available digital/analog channels in your area, otherwise is will likely only show the analog stations.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "should have been a 5star if ....", "Author": "nodoubt", "ReviewID": "R3J75YUN1X2UNQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i would have rated this product a 5 star if the screen was matte.  the tv came with a glossy screen so you need to set the tv up in a dark room to get rid of annoying light reflection while watching.  also you need a sound bar or a hook up to a home theater system to improve the sound output and you need to buy an optical cable for your audio hook up but it's still a good buy for all the features that you get.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "My view", "Author": "Paul cates", "ReviewID": "RGQAY0UJD8ZNR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sound is not so great, but will be connecting surround system soon.

It's a weakness that it won't play WMV but if Panasonic is cutting the cord of Microsoft dependence,that's a real strength to me. Your opinion may vary on the media server capabilities. I mostly don't care. I don't really care aboutor have tested the Viera Connect.The remote is not universal. Not a problem for me but you should know that.

I went to the big box stores, asked questions, examined the floor displays, and read reviews online from various outlets.  I will say that almost a month in, this TV is great.  I use it for my digital cable, Blu-Ray, and hook up my PC to it.  I run the sound through my home theater system for the previously mentioned items.  So far, no problems and lots of compliments.  The setup was incredibly easy, the instructions are easy to follow and the jacks are clearly labeled.  The TV is very light.  The picture is very crisp and the settings are easily adjustable.  The remote is easy to use.  This has all of the features of any LG or Samsung, only was about $400 cheaper ($799 w/ free shipping - great sale price!!).  Even at the price of $999, I would say this is a better deal than the LG or Samsung counterparts as it has all of the features, comparable jacks.  The features this TV has are the same as most other non-3D TVs.  Purchasing with Amazon was flawless - delivery in two days, no shipping charge, no sales tax!!!My previous TV was a Sony 33\" Trinitron.  It lasted almost 10 years, but I have a Panasonic in my bedroom that is going on 20 years and no flaws at all.  My DVD player is a Panasonic and works like a charm.  So, I am biased writing on Panasonic because I have had such a positive history with them.  For what is worth, one of the guys at the big box stores said they get fewer Panasonic returns than any other brand.  That is nice, but they also don't push Panasonic like they do LG and Samsung.This TV has 2 HDMI inputs (one for my Blu Ray and one for my Cable Box), 1 PC SGVA jack, 4 USBs, Ethernet, wi-fi ready (not built in, so I use my Blu Ray which has built in WiFi), and one jack that handles component / audio in.  The only thing I messed up on in my research was that the only audio out was an optical jack only.  There is no red / white jacks for audio out.  I was worried when I bought the TV as my Onkyo 602 receiver does not have USB / HDMI inputs and I was going to have to upgrade my receiver.  However, I ran everything in through my television and the audio out to my Onkyo works perfectly for everything (DVD, Cable, PC Games, etc.).", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "YOU CAN DO BETTER !!", "Author": "D. Bacsoka \"DJB\"", "ReviewID": "R33O0HEQ4B4RCK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for over a week now and I think that for the price this is solid TV with a life-like picture. I've found the TV settings to be intuitive and easy enough to change but you will have to do MAJOR tweaks in the picture to get a good picture.  Sports are just OK.  I do have a sharp eye.  I see the images blur and breakdown sometimes and find that things seem to work best with motion setting on \"weak\" or \"off\" but it's still far from perfect.  I thought the 120hz refresh rate would be great for sports when on full blast - but it's not.  As for the sound, it's better than I thought it would be - perhaps this was the most pleasant surprise about this TV.INTERNET SMART FEATURES / AMAZON VIDEO:Regarding the  \"Smart TV\" function: (I would only give this function ONE and HALF STAR).This TV is not so smart.  Honestly, one of the main reasons I'm thinking of returning this TV is because the Amazon video application is SO BAD.  Imagine a streaming video application without a 'cue' or watch list?  It's here!  Imagine an application where fast forward and rewind functions will make you pine for your old VHS system? That's here too! It's so bad, it's absolutely incredible. You can't view what you are fast forwarding at all. Haha You literally have to rewind or fast forward a video completely blind and hope you hit the right spot.  Imagine how annoyingly painful this is. Also, if you are watching a TV series it will provide you with no evidence that you've ever watched it let alone what episode you left off at. But this smart TV will not prevent you from writing down in a note pad what episode you left off at.  Phew, this TV may not be smart, but at least it's not evil.It's apparent that ZERO effort was put into this Amazon application. Ironically, it's one of the only applications they have. (Sure you can buy some third rate games, but if you do this please email me because I have a lovely bridge to sell you somewhere in Brooklyn if you do this.) Look, I love Amazon video - but the application on this TV almost ruins the TV for me: IT'S HORRIBLE on VIERA. It's an application that exhibits disdain for it's users.  You have to experience this for yourself, ...or NOT.Also, this model requires you to purchase a $62 wireless adapter for the privilege of having this shoddy experience.  Can you say \"nickle and dime\", or how about, \"rip off\"?  I can.NETFLIX:I must say that the Netflix experience on this TV is much better than Amazon Video - but that's not saying too much is it?  I've noticed a blinking black screen several times repetitively on 2 shows.  When this happened it was almost unwatchable.  Again, it's here that the software interface could use improvement and is a glitch that I never noticed on a Roku.  But hey, at least Netfix seemed to put their C team on this application, and that's a big improvement over the team Amazon put on theirs; a small yet robust team of binge drinking junior college dropouts.VIERA LESSON:  Stick to a dumber TV and get a ROKU for the likes of Amazon and Netflix.  The Roku is cheaper (than the wireless adaptor, works better, gets frequent updates, has many many more app choices, and has much better overall features, bells, whistles and attention to detail.SO WHY IS THE VIERA 'SMART' EXPERIENCE SOOOOO BAD??:I'm starting to think the experience is so much better on the Roku in large part because it was such a big seller. The other half is because the people at Roku seem to 'care'. Imagine that.  Roku gets frequent over the air updates.  Don't underestimate this.  Think about your smart phone and it's software updates.  Smart TV's like the Viera line simply aren't getting much attention from the likes of Amazon and Netflix. Panasonic must have very little pull with these vendors because the extreme negligence is palpable. The apps are so bad that I have no trouble imagining the Viera department in Panasonic's R&D; wing to be filled with employees doing things like finger painting and lighting their farts on fire - ALL day long.  I've searched for \"updates Viera\" online and it seems the last software update was in March of 2012.  Almost comical.  Hey Amazon, what are you waiting for?  Fix this garbage application please - your company is better than this!  I'm a prime member dammit!  (I'm sure this will get someone right on the case).* I also noticed that the new 2013 Viera Tv's will be full of all kinds of nifty features.  It doesn't appear that this Viera will be getting any of these software enhancements.  Way to treat your customers Panasonic!----------------ADS?  (UPDATED)I was really annoyed by the appearance of sponsored banner ads on the volume rocker and when turning on the TV (also in the internet section) but it was pointed out to me that you can turn these off.  I still think it's annoying that you have to dig through advance settings to find the turn off switch for these - but at least it's there.-----------------AMAZON TV PRICE GUARANTEE = NOT SO GREATLastly, I'd like to point out that the  \"Amazon TV Low Price Guarantee\" does not include any other promotions.  Perhaps this is in the very fine print, but who reads that? Just 4 days after I bought this TV not only did the price drop $50, but Amazon started issuing a $100 promotional credit to anyone who bought it.  I noticed this and was credited with the $50 difference for the price drop - but as for the $100 promotional credit I was told that I was out of luck.  Really?BUT the service rep came to the rescue and provided me with a solution to get this $100 promotional credit:All I would have to do was to send the current TV (back because of one of my complaints), order and pay for a new one - the new TV would get the $100 promotion they are unwilling to credit me with.  Then I could repack/rebox the old TV and send it back for a full refund.I said, that this seemed, wasteful, inefficient, and unproductive for both me and Amazon.  Why pay all these unnecessary shipping and labor costs and waste this time for what would ultimately just result in a TV swap when I was (reluctantly) willing to keep the TV?  I again asked Amazon, to please just credit me with the $100 promotion and I'll keep this TV and save all of us the trouble of having to play the dum dum game of re-box, ship, wait, receive, carry, unbox, unclutter, again.  She apologetically reported that this would be impossible, but encouraged me to still send the current TV back, and take advantage of the promotion.Really Amazon?  No wonder you are still in the red.  At least this sort of nonsense keeps my UPS driver really busy and maybe, his salary up.  And that's great, because he's a nice guy.------------------------I'm keeping my eye out for other TV's during the return window.  Despite this TV's low price, the lack of detail paid to the software, combined with certain small picture issues makes me feel like those responsible for making this TV and the \"smart' experience never loved it, so why should I?DJB", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fabulous picture and good sound for a bedroom.", "Author": "M.

I purchased it for 3 things:1. To play Xbox on2. To watch sports on3. To stream an occasional movie the wife does not want to watch.This TV worked beautifully with my Xbox on games. Halo 4, Left4Dead and Rock Band 3 looked stellar. No faults there. For movies, again incredible picture, especially viewing some of the \"Frozen Planet\" episodes in HD. Where this TV really struggled was viewing football and basketball. The views after the plays, of the sidelines and of the halftime shows were great. When the networks would pan out to show the action of the plays, it had real issues. The picture would be pixelated sometimes so bad that you could not read the jersey numbers. The edges of the players during plays became very dull and \"un-sharp\" during those times. You would also see halos and artifacts around the players. You would also see \"blobs\" in the field where the turf was not sharp and looked like a green \"blob. In watching basketball, I would notice the same issues. It had a real hard time staying sharp during sports action. My point of comparison when I started to notice this was my 2 year old Samsung 6500 series which has an excellent picture and none of these artifacts.In trying to improve the picture, I used some online calibration settings from various sites which were very similar but to no avail. I contacted Panasonic and they were absolutely no help as I could not access any of the other menu settings other than the simple ones under the \"menu\" button.Maybe I was missing something but overall I was not impressed. If you are a non-sports fan and only watch TV shows, movies and game, then this is a great set. If you watch sports at all, go with a Samsung or LG.

Alas, my parents don't comparison shop and don't go to electronic stores weekly as I do. So, they had little actual knowledge of what to look for in a TV that would be in their particular viewing setting.This TV is an acceptable HDTV, but a nice picture and several HDMI inputs are no longer sufficient to be a great product. Here are some cons and pros of this particular model, based on my several day experience of setting up the TV and watching it with my parents:Cons:1) Very reflective screen- while not shiny glass, the matte of the screen is reflective enough that every light and every well-lit object in the room can be seen on the screen. This for me would be enough to send the TV back.2) Only one composite/component input - obviously, not so important if you have only digital sources to view, but my parents had a VCR and a non-HDMI DVD player, both of which they still use. OOOPS3) A lot of features require internet connection, which either requires ethernet wired to the TV or the special proprietary USB dongle4) Sound not very loud - this is common with thin TVs, but the problem is more pronounced in this set than in most of those I have seen or own.5) Banner \"ads\" that pop up when you turn on the set and do various things, unless you disable them (and my parents would NEVER have been able to play around long enough to find out how to do this).6) Remote switching of input devices could be easier (it is not terrible, but I had to run things through with my parents more times than I hoped would be necessary).Pros1) Decent picture (generally pretty dark for my taste, even on the brightest settings, I assume to mimic plasma)2) 4 HDMI inputs (one or two more than others I have seen of this screen size)3) Very thin form factor4) Built in internet features, including Netflix, if you either have an ethernet connection handy or want to spring for the optional USB-wifi dongle.My parents are happy with this TV, but then they watch in utter darkness in a very dark room. In those conditions, this is a fine TV, but if the viewing situation is anything different, you must either be quite tolerant of reflection or might be happier with another model/brand.

That is not true.  You have to separately Panasonic TY-WL20U Wireless Adapter, or you do NOT have a Wi-Fi, Internet Ready television.

That would seem OK, although it is at least another $100.  Here's the deal, while you can get it work that way, the two USB ports are so close together, that even though there is more than one USB port, the Panasonic wireless adapter is large that it takes up both USB ports.  So then once you have it connected to the Internet, if you want to link to Skype, etc, well you CAN NOT.  Why?  Because since the Internet is not BUILT-IN on this model, the Internet adapter takes up both USB ports, and by the way, if you try to get a bus or a cord to make more space, then the Viera won't work with the Panasonic Internet adapter.

I specifically bought this TV so I could stream shows from Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc; It was advertised as \"wifi\" capable.Well what they don't tell you is that you need a separate \"wifi adapter\" that connects to the TV via the USB port.  I've done my research and it seems that you can only use a Panasonic device (hard to find), which seems to sell at Amazon for between $60-120.Um yeah that's a lot of money, considering that I already paid a premium for this TV over other TVs that are not wifi capable.Actually with Panasonic's logic, EVERY TV is wifi capable.

It should be noted however that this is based on my reaction to ALL the new LCD/LED's not just this particular one. I will still give the Panasonic LCD 4 stars though and is an excellent choice, especially with its brilliant IPS screen. The picture, while really good, was not quite as good as my Sony Bravia which died the same month as its warranty expired (like the 2 before it!). Goodbye Sony. While the LCD's look superior in stores with bright lights, the Panasonic Plasma had a strong edge in a Home Theater Stores with lighting more similar to my living room. On several occasions at the Home Theater Store I compared the Panasonic Plasma with the $2,700 Sony HD LCD across from it. To me the Panasonic Plasma had the edge in reproducing colors, especially blacks and easier on the eyes.The Panasonic Plasma is a fantastic TV. No problems at all were observed with any Plasma \"noise\" or screen reflections.In the old days people recommended Plasmas should be \"broken-in\" for 100 hours or so. I made no special effort to really do that but did stay away from fixed images, higher contrast, high brightness and bars during that time. It is now in full Custom mode and looks great.I am not yet using the 3D feature so can't provide a comment.The Viera Smart internet functions work fine but doubt I will use them much.If you like watching your programming in a normal to more dimly light room, you should strongly consider the Panasonic Viera Plasma.

One of them came with the dent down the center of the back panel, the other had two dents on the right side of the back panel. The one with the dents on the side was very hard to tell right away (FEDEX Delivery). I made them out when I noticed flashlighting on the right side of the panel. After looking carefully, I realized it was the two dents that were pushing the LCD panel and the LED lights out of their proper position. They were right behind the plastic bezel.The one with the damage running on the center of the back panel was delivered by the supposedly \"white glove\" service (ceva). The \"white glove\" geniuses did a real thorough job. The TV not only had a crease in the center of the back panel, but a permanent bow in addition. They must have tried really hard to deform the TV. It was also producing a Clunking sound when moving it from the face down position to the upright position.The guy who designed the packaging for those should really be fired because he has no clue about protecting the TV during shipping. The Boxes should be made stiffer and able to resist moisture which makes matters even worse, by softening the already low quality cardboard used in their packaging. My wife also received a panasonic with damage in the back panel. That one was also a FEDEX accomplishment and went back already.This is a total of three out of the three TVs ordered.

Far worse than I expected, and I wasn't expecting much.Panasonic made things worse by not including analog output (some new TV's still have them), and then compounded the issue by not allowing the digital audio output format to be specified.  Other manufactures allow the output format to be specified as 2 ch stereo. Not Panasonic. Less expensive D/A converters and soundbars don't handle Dolby Digital. This rules out many sound bars and bumps the cost of a converter from $25 to $90.Bottom line: If you're expecting to simply replace an older set you need to plan on spending $$ on additional equipment (and have room for it). And, you need to be careful that what you get is compatible (hdmi or optical digital connections + built in dolby digital decoder).In addition, I can't figure out the reasoning behind their current lineup of sound bars. The best match for my setup are two from last year.Picture is OK, but not great when compared to 20+ year old CRT. Requires constant fiddling depending upon source material. Significant loss of contrast when viewed off angle, though color shift is minimal. Panasonic claims '178 degrees' viewing angle but this is defined as the range where contrast is 10:1 or higher. 10:1 is quite poor. Don't confuse this with a plasma! Black level is tough to get right. Dark areas tend to come out black. Cranking up the brightness does solve the black problem, but then objects that are actually black become gray.Closed captioning is very basic. Can't adjust font size or position, and will \"zoom\" off the screen under certain circumstances.TV is \"wireless Internet ready\"... this means it includes a Ethernet port for a wired connection, but does not have wireless (wifi) built-in. For wireless you must purchase TY-WL20U adapter which plugs into one of the two USB ports.The box that the TV arrived in had suffered some damage. The cardboard was rather thin and not much in the way of Styrofoam packaging material. However, the set itself appeared to be undamaged. These TV's appear to be somewhat fragile. I wouldn't think twice about returning if I saw *any* damage to the TV.Power consumption is quite low, but is somewhat negated by all of the extra gizmo's that are needed to get decent sound.I give it 1 star for sound, 3.5 for picture.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Internet Ready", "Author": "holymosy", "ReviewID": "R2L84MTWA067L7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We thought when we purchased this TV that is was a matter of plugging it in and setting up the Wifi.

After a great deal of trouble shooting I found that the DY-WL10 was the cause of the problem. It does not have the range nor the bandwidth to solve to handle HD movies. I solved the problem by adding a Netgear range extender and coupling the signal from that into the TV using a 10/100 LAN cable. Now the DL-WL10 is in the junk box. My other problem with this rush-to-market TV is how dumb it's Netflix interface is. You have to use an external computer to put a show on your instant queue before you can find it on the Panasonic.
