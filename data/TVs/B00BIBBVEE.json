I'm hoping the box they sent my sister which doesn't show what type of TV is in fact a 3D TV.  I'm going to contact the Vender to see how they will make this right due to mailing this TV back would cost so much that I wouldn't be saving and wouldn't have a 40 inch TV, let alone the 3D TV I thought I had bought", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome quality and value", "Author": "John Greathouse", "ReviewID": "RGO2WG0Q3MX05", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been using several Sansui TVs in the house for years and they are excellent quality.
