{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Everythings awesome... except input lag.", "Author": "Darren", "ReviewID": "R2RV6CYQMH8HVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I primarily bought this TV because I was using my Samsung XL2370 23\" monitor for playing my Xbox 360 and it was difficult having to sit so close to the screen (Console games are designed to be played on a largish screen from a further distance, as opposed to PC games which are designed to be played on a smallish screen from a close distance). I bought this TV for my Xbox 360 and also to watch 1080P movies because the HDMI port on the Samsung isn't very good, it's not native support so it's blurry.Anyways, the picture quality on this TV is excellent. The smart dimming may not be quite as expensive as a TV with a full-array LED backlights, but it works wells enough that really dark scenes look a little bit better, you can usually notice when only one area of the screen has dimmed or is dimming, it just doesn't follow the movement of light colored objects as well as a full-array equipped TV. The contrast and shadow quality is great, and the colors are well saturated. I haven't seen the non-LED version of this TV but it seems that this one does have better contrast because it's the best I've seen on a TV under 40\".The sound is pretty good, it's better than a lot of flat-screen TV's, especially because flat screens prevent the speakers being able to have deep mounts. It's why LCD's always have tinny sound, but the bass is fairly good on this TV. 10 watts each is actually better than average for built in speakers.Standard definition TV looks pretty darn good if you put a lot of the post-processing on such as noise reduction. Everyone knows SD looks worse on an HDTV than a SDTV, but the plethora of post-processing options help a lot to make up for that as much as purists may not like those. There is a lip-sync option in the audio or video menu that can help make up for the input lag that is added for using these processes.Movies are awesome. It's pretty cool that this TV has a Toslink/Optical output built in so that if you have a speaker system with an integrated amp such as Logitech 5.1 speakers for computers, you can just plug it right in and get 5.1 from your HDMI. Note that this TV does NOT have a miniplug (3.5mm headphone jack) output so it will not work out-of-the-box with stereo or 2.1 computer speakers or non-Bluetooth headphones. The movie setting in the video menu worked well for Iron Man 2 and the 120Hz and smooth motion stuff makes action scenes a lot less nauseating.Now the main con I have (which I will update if I remedy it with instructions). Vizio TV's are apparently known for their input lag, which is due in part to their circuitry design, partially to their over-use of post-processing (color enhancement, noise reduction, smooth-motion, smart dimming etc.) and the last one is actually a blessing and a curse: they use IPS-Pro or S-IPS panels (I forget which), which have superior off angle viewing angles and color accuracy, but have far inferior response time (input lag) except in the most advanced and expensive displays. Despite going to a larger screen with way better contrast and twice the refresh rate, my Halo: Reach scores are WAY down because of the input lag. I've tried turning off ALL post-processing and trying with the \"Game Mode\" (not picture setting, there is something called \"Game Mode\" in the general options that isn't defined. Usually this turns post-processing off or goes into overdrive mode to improve response time) and turning them on, separately, I haven't been able to get the input lag to improve enough (there is a small difference so I'm on the right track). I tried using VGA with a crappy VGA adapter and it was better, so this is likely due to un-disable-able post processing (VGA is raw there are limited video options when using VGA) that occurs when using HDMI. I also tried setting my Xbox to 720P and I don't think that made any difference (probably because of added upscaling). I'm going to try buying a wired controller (supposedly removes up to 1.78ms of input lag) and using Component to see if it's better. A lot of time analogue inputs are faster for various reasons).The Vizio Internet Apps are pretty awesome, albeit slow. Because it uses Yahoo! widgets, you can count on their being more options to surplus the already existing options (Great! There is even an app for seeing what my Xbox Live friends are playing! Most awesome show-off app ever, + Yahoo! Finance, weather, Wikipedia!! Vimeo, Vudu, Amazon Video On-Demand, Web Videos...) regardless of whether Vizio is committed to continual support, which is a nice comfort. The only thing that could make this more cool is if you could play Pandora in the background while playing Xbox.Other cool things, picture in picture controls are intuitive. This seems to be a kind of neglected option in TV's these days so it's nice and nostalgic. The resolution of the screen is nice enough that using the side by side option you can watch both, or switch to cable with Xbox in the corner looking for multiplayer matches (best use in my opinion). Digital and analogue closed captioning (whatever that means). The menus have a nice elegant slate blue and grey scheme with shadows and anti-aliased text that follows the widget layout, and is consistent in little things like volume adjustment. First-time-start setup is cool you can create an account on the TV and choose a picture avatar, you can set parental controls on a profile you make for your kids, set your zipcode so the weather and other appropriate apps can give appropriate information, the remote is bluetooth so you can point it anywhere, the QWERTY keyboard makes text entry so much better, you can turn your Xbox off with the remote! I'm trying to think of little cool things that other reviewers haven't mentioned... Easy switching of picture zoom modes for TV, there is a somewhat useless but cool power button on the side that rotates to change channels, but trust me, do NOT lose the remote. Once you go QWERTY it's hard to go back!One other thing to note, which may be a big thing to you, this TV is a little quirky. My remote and physical controls on the TV were non-functional randomly while watching TV. The manual suggests a hard shutdown by unplugging it: this seems dangerous and sort of barbaric for such a big ticket item. There is a rather large troubleshooting section: I think Vizio is admittant there that you really are getting what you pay for, this TV saves money on getting the most reliable or consistent components.I'll edit this post with my Xbox antics. Please leave comments if you have any questions or a solution to my problem.PS: I would assume everything in this review applies to the 32\" (XVT323SV) version as well.EDIT: 10/16/10So I believe there is a \"break in\" period in which the response time has gotten better. I've been using the same HDMI port (side) since I got the TV because I can't find the HDMI cable for my laptop so I've been taking it out of the Xbox and putting it into my laptop and vice versa. Either I'm getting used to it (doubt it, it was really bad) or the response time is getting better. LCD's aren't really supposed to have a break in period, but maybe Vizio does less hours worth of testing so whereas a Sony or Samsung would be broken in by the time it leaves testing, a Vizio is still \"cold\" per se. I am now able to play Halo: Reach just fine. I'm pretty sure the menus are a little more responsive too. I'm pretty sure it's not just me getting used to it because I'm able to track enemies a lot better in close quarters and the sound seems more synced up well. Because of this, I can recommend this TV for gaming in all but fighting games like Street Fighter because I know you guys need the best-of-the-best response time. I played Iron Man 2 in 1080p on loop overnight and it seems to have improved the response of the screen and/or broken that specific HDMI port in.Because of this I am changing it to a five-star review. It really is the best value and the best 37\" TV as far as I know.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "1,000,000 to 1 Contrast Ratio Gives Great Picture Quality", "Author": "WJK \"Consumer Advocate\"", "ReviewID": "R35YNVADWL7LW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I read some of the other reviews here and elsewhere, I see that their expectations for this TV were a little unrealistic when it comes to using it as a computer screen.  Before I bought it through Sam's for $698 (deal is off now, but probably will be back for Christmas), I researched it completely.  The Internet Apps right now are OK, but more will come that will be exciting in the future through automatically downloaded firmware updates.  I was told by Vizio that eventually, it probably will have the capability to Wi-Fi what is on your computer screen to this TV.  But, as for now, I'm very happy with the picture quality and size of this TV, as I watch it from a 10 to 15 foot distance away.  Like someone else said, it is not too big, and not too small.  When I watch HD Theatre channel's travel/nature shows, the picture quality is close to a Blue Ray's quality, IMO.Oh, the lower amount of heat that comes off, and the less electricity use than my 2 1/2 year old Sony Bravia S-Series KDL-32S3000 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV that went bad, are great buyer benefits!  Sony wanted me to take that tv to an authorized Sony repair shop and pay $50 to find out why the picture went out with no guarantees that they would pay for parts and/or labor to fix it.  I thought it was throwing good money after the bad $900 that I had paid for the TV.  So, on my new 37 inch Vizio, I bought Sam's 3 extra year extended warranty for $79.96 after reading the \"fine print\".  No extended warranty is perfect, but Sam's was the least offensive, IMO.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for a great price", "Author": "A.

One call to Amazon and they immediately placed another product to be shipped. If this happens to anyone, call Amazon immediately and they will get another shipment out otherwise you have to go through the return procedure thru their website.The TV is awesome. It has great picture and great sound. The Vizio Apps thats installed is simple and easy to operate. The initial set-up was a breeze and the prompts are user-friendly. The great part of the TV is the cool remote it came with. It has a built in keyboard. Once you set up all of your widgets, profile, and other equipment, you won't need the keyboard as much. The remote is also a universal remote and can control your cable box and any other audio or video equipment. Again, setting it up is so easy. You just have to identify the brand of your equipment and the remote works like a charm. The only disadvantage with the remote is it does not seem to have the ability to page up or page down on the program guide when you're looking to browse what's on the over 200 channels offered by your cable company. I still keep my cable remote to browse channels.There are many TV settings to choose from. And you can save the settings based on your profile. You and your wife may pick different widgets and have your own Facebook and Twitter accounts. That's alright as long as you input your login info, the system automatically will log you in every time you turn on your TV or when you switch profiles.Before I bought the TV, I had a chance to check out Google TV.  This TV is not a Google TV. So don't mistake that. It uses Yahoo widgets and the Facebook feature or \"widget\" does not display the full site. It still allows you to look at wall updates and enter your status but it doesn't give you the whole Facebook page that you get when you access the site from an actual computer.If you have a Netflix account, it works seamlessly with the TV and it works exactly the same when you access it on your PS3 or Wii units. When you do an initial set-up, you just need to get a code from Netflix so you'll need to access your account over your computer to get the code.To summarize, the TV's best feature is it's ease of use and initial set-up, the cool remote, ability to switch profiles based on who's using the TV, and all the widgets you can get. Oh, picture quality is great too!I definitely recommend it and if you're going to buy it, the best place to buy it from is from Amazon.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Vizio HDTV XVT373SV", "Author": "Topher \"lavasurfer.com\"", "ReviewID": "R2P0AAAVFHEKMA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spend too much time investigating everything I buy.  After weeks of field work, including reading the helpful reviews on Amazon, I selected this Visio 37\" LED LCD HDTV (Model XVT373SV) for $629 from Amazon.Pros:1. it was the exact size I needed for my bedroom, where I also have a desk andwork on the computer.2. it was the only 120Hz HDTV in it's price class. All the others were only 60Hz.  This is important.  The higher this number (60 - 120 - 240 - 480) the less motion blur you should experience.  So an upgrade from 60 to 120 is a great start.3. The wireless internet wi-fi connection works great.  It was easy to set up.  I am using an old Linksys Wireless 802.11N Router (Model WRT150N) running with encryption.  It's connected to a cable modem with Time Warner Road Runner service. I just had to shorten the password to about 22 characters.  If you get good wi-fi reception in the room, then the tv's internet connection will work just fine.  (Note: It has to be 802.11n).  I've run my desk computer's internet connection via wi-fi so I knew I already had a good wi-fi connection. You can also connect the TV directly to the internet via an ethernet cord.4. The sound is very good for my purposes.  What do you expect? It's not close to what a Bose 5+1 sound system will get you (which by the way is really nice), but for a TV speaker it's still very good.5. Nice HD picture when connected to a cablebox and viewing HD channels.  Straight-on is awesome.  If I am at my desk, my viewing angle is less than optimal: 70-degrees to the side and about 35-degrees down --- the picture is still pretty good (it washes out a little, but it's still very clear).6. The set up process is very easy and worked great.7. Remote has a slideout keyboard for internet use.Cons:1. no \"Sleep timer\" button on the remote.  You have to work your way into a menu system to activate it.2. delay when changing channels, but this also occurs on my 52\" Samsung HDTV too.3. menus are not optimized to make searching for internet content as easy as you would like.Other:1. If you belong to Amazon Prime, you can currently stream about 2,200 movies and TV shows for free off the internet. (40,000 more are avalable on a pay-per-view basis).  I am streaming via my wi-fi connection.  I have not experienced ANY delay and the picture quality has been excellent.2. Widgets are direct links to internet content which appear at the bottom of your screen after you hit a button on your remote.  You can set up widgets for Yahoo Sports (like Fantasy Football, but not Fantasy Baseball yet), weather, Netfix, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Blockuster, and about 100 others.  If you want to delete any internet widgets that appear on the bottom of the screen (after you you activate them), highlight the widget in question, click the \"yellow\" bar button, then \"red\", then \"red\" again to delete the widget.3. The booklet that comes with the tv will pretty much allow you to do what needs to be done to get you up and running.4. Visio Support can be found at: [...]5.

I have been looking at LED TV's for about 3 months and have been doing hours of online research to find the TV that will give me the most bang for my buck. This exact model kept coming up on review websites so I finally decided to keep it in the running among other bigger name brands such as Samsung (which I initially wanted the most) & Sony Bravias. The reviews were similar between the 3 but the big difference was price. Samsungs and Sonys have a great reputation for TV's and I saw a big difference when placed next to most other brands but they were priced 30-50% more than this Vizio model.Review:From right out of the box, set up was mostly easy with one small hiccup. The instructions vaguely mention how to set up your cable from Satelite or Digital connections so I had to call and get directions. Initially, the menu and multi-layered settings via the on screen prompting is not always clear and it can be frustrating at times. After getting everything figured out though, this TV delivers on everything I could want in a TV. First and foremost, the picture quality in HD is stunning. Many people who have come over since first purchasing it have commented on the superior image quality. The colors are bright and distinct and the 120 mhz makes a noticeable difference when watching sports and actions sequences. Close-ups are much more detailed but the one small issue I've noticed with it is, in dark scenes, sometimes the screen is just too dark. Perhaps this is from the movie itself versus the TV but it's worth mentioning.The sound quality & max volume of the TV is well above average which is a nice change from other flat screens I've owned. The on screen integrated applications are a cinch to use and I <3 being able to watch Netflix without turning my PS3 on and off. The remote control with the keyboard comes in handy often and its very responsive so this is just icing on the cake for people who plan on searching for movies via Netflix, using FaceBook, or even posting on Twitter etc. The TV had no issues syncing up with my HD DVR, PS3 & Surround Sound so kudos to Vizio for making it so easy.The last thing I want to mention is that while watching a movie on Netflix, my TV just froze completely and the remote would not turn it off. I had to physically unplug the TV from the wall and replug it in and wait about 30 seconds for it to work again. It has only happened once but it is something I will watch out for and keep my review updated on if need be. Otherwise, this TV is awesome and I love both the quality I got as well as the price point. I recommend it all the way.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture technology with many handy features.  A winner.", "Author": "Barry J. Schneider \"need2act\"", "ReviewID": "R20E0RRT50ZCNB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this TV to replace a 19\" CRT, in a bright studio apt. living room w/2 windows, to fit in decorative fireplace. Deep blacks would be critical.Usage: Movie & TV viewing, simple stereo hookup, Wifi (w/Aiport Express) and HD cable.  Occasional use as a monitor from a MacBook or Hard Drive.Impression: Quality product, nicely designed, easy to hookup.  Frame & screen are less reflective than models I've seen at the store. The UI is satisfying; app system is a breeze & customizable.  Nice that whatever you're watching can still be seen along w/launched apps--especially handy when using the HDTV settings app).Image: You'll see right away how the screen adjusts from overly lit blacks to deep blacks while the Vizio logo displays at turn on.  To adjust broadcast images, I adjusted settings on an as-needed basis.  A big mistake I made was relying on the video colors of local channel NY1. I had trouble with a yellows not looking very natural. As soon as I switched to CBS or NBC I had a far more trustworthy color palate.  I elected not to use anybody's calibration settings that I saw on the web, believing that everybody had different tastes.  A few weeks later I was stunned by the excellence of the image of the State of the Union Speech (any channel), and Colbert & Stewart (Comedy Central).  I read up on a overall method for improving image, and now I switch between 2 primary settings: Standard and Movie. I went into stores after making this purchase and fully believe that this LED w/Edge Lit technology, 1mil:1 contrast completely beat out the detail level and image quality of the higher-end brand names offering older LCD technology for less.Remote: This item was a big selling point that I realized only AFTER using it.  First, it's got a beautiful, simple & modern design (I looked at pictures of the remotes of remotes from other brands & models by downloading their manuals of many others, but ALL were old-fashioned).  Second, it has the advantage of being an almost perfect universal remote. ($ value).  Third, it uses Bluetooth to communicate, so you don't need to 'point' it at the TV.  Fourth, it has a teeny-fingered slide-out keyboard.  Anticipating the internet usage (e.g Facebook) convergence w/TV, it seemed like a keyboard would be a useful feature.  It surely helped during the setup and some Facebook usage.Modernity: Internet ready; Wifi built-in ($ value; no dongle needed); USB ports.  All great to keep this TV for many years to come.Applications: As my first foray into the modern age, I'm satisfied (for now) with the apps that I found. The media widgets (Netflix, Amazon, Vudu) & weather (Yahoo!, Accuweather) are the most complete and practical.  Pandora is nice but why have the TV on to hear music?  Flickr is very nice.  Facebook, Twitter, Fandango, WikiTV are handy although liimited.Sound: Perfectly ample for my simple needs.  Richer than I expected for it was far better than my old TV.  No need to use stereo for regular use.Hookups: More than I needed.  Until I get a blu-ray, I used AV (red-yellow-white).  Wifi handy for eliminating the Ethernet cable.SUMMARY:  A great TV for 37\".  If you can go up to 42\", can afford an extra 1\" of depth and the additional cost, then I'd recommend the XVT423SV:  Better technology (full array w/local dimming, 10 mil:1 contrast, 240HZ) making the viewing experience even better.Note: The 37\" didn't fit in my fireplace and then, needing to get one that would cover its opening, I went looking for a larger screen size.  After many DAYS of review reading and research of all brands, I took a chance on Vizio's 42\"  because CNet and Consumer Reports still recommended this model and considered the XVT3SV series the best of 2010-- despite the concerns about blooming and sound that was identified in their models 42\"+.  I'm thrilled by my choice, which suffers not at all from sound, and the blooming I have yet to see. The 1\" thicker housing is less elegant, but on all other fronts the XVT423SV is a welcome step up in size & quality.Room for improvement:1) HDTV Settings Widget: Would be nice to scroll through Picture Modes (Movies, Standard, Sports, e.g.) when it is visible on the menu.  Launching the app to change this setting takes too many clicks.  Other manufactures have an easy to use mode button on their (ugly) remotes.2) Time Warner Codes: Two features still tether me to my old remote: Favorites and Page Up/Dn, features found on other remotes.  Favorites, of course, saves one time by skipping undesired channels, and TW's interface requires Page Up/Dn to scroll through screens of information.3) Picture Modes:  It's overkill having 4 sports settings.  This viewer never needs those.  Handier would be Daytime, Nighttime, or even more than one Custom setting.4) Apps: YouTube and Picasa were noticeably missing, but they may come sign up in the future.  The most important Apps are already supplied.  Additionally, by not being able to click on links (FB, Twitter...) the functionality of those apps is limited.  Some browser functionality would be a nice upgrade.5) Wireless streaming of videos from Apple computers.

But the remote and batteries were kind of \"hidden\" in a slot and I almost thought they were missing.SETUP: I used the detachable base to place the TV on a stand. You just need to \"plug\" the TV to the base. The problem is that the base does not swivel. It was very easy to connect the TV to my wireless network, laptop (HDMI), DVD player using the setup wizard.PICTURE: This is the best part of this TV. I expected output from SD sources (like DVD player connected using a composite cable - 480i) to look worse than my earlier CRT SD TV, but the picture actually looks BETTER, and the quality is just stunning with HD sources. I had to experiment with the picture settings for the first few days to get it just right, but the \"Movie\" mode seems to work best across all sources. The screen does not have any glare and the backlight adjusts automatically with ambient light to give a great looking picture, night or day. The 120 Hz refresh rate takes some time to get used to - it affects the \"cadence\" and motion appears to be \"too smooth\" (arguably more life-like, but not movie-like or TV-like, if you are used to a 60Hz TV). The TV also has a \"frame rate detection\" feature, so when I connected my laptop to the TV using an HDMI cable and played a 25 frames/sec video, the TV preserved the frame rate.AUDIO: I love the surround sound and auto-volume leveling. However, the speakers are not that great (only 10W x2)APPS: I tried Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Video on demand and Vudu and all of them worked great. Setting up Netflix was a cinch, unlike what some other reviewers say. I don't have a cable or satellite subscription; I only watch TV shows and movies over the internet and get DVDs from Netflix, so having an internet-connected TV helps a lot. The firmware updates automatically, and hopefully more apps will be added later (A YouTube app is sorely missing).REMOTE: The remote has a full-QWERTY slide-out keyboard with bluetooth, which is great.

Setting up the TV was simple; just follow the steps found on the quick start guide.One thing I will point out to those connecting to a wireless network is that if you have a space in your network password, the TV will not recognize it. After numerous failed attempts at connecting, I created a new password for my wireless router (without a space in it) and then connected with no problem. The QWERTY keyboard was very handy for this and other set up steps.It's odd that the TV comes with 3 USB ports that at this point in time provide no function whatsoever.

So don't plan on totally replacing all of your other remote controls with this one.Lastly, I bought the 4 year extended warranty from Amazon, as it was on sale and not much more money than the 3 year plan. I've had my share of electronics fail on me in the past, and it usually happens about 1 month after the manufacturer's warranty runs out.

Munn", "ReviewID": "R1Q1PKCVVUGE64", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "2011-06-17: Yet another VIZIO Customer Service encounter. . .this time FRUITLESS!I spent over 30 minutes with customer service and they refused to acknowledge that the following problem is with the TV. I have a new camera that shoots HD (1080P) video and audio. It has standard HDMI output. There are no settings on the camera to change the type of HDMI output, it is just HDMI industry standard. I connect a HDMI cable to the camera and attach to our VIZIO 22\" TV or a friend's Samsung HDTV and the video and audio play perfectly. I attach the same camera, and the same cable, to this XVT373SV and the video plays fine, but no audio. I have tried all the HDMI inputs, even the one through which a Blu-ray was playing seconds before and the VIZIO plays no audio. I've cold booted the TV and they confirmed I have the last Firmware update installed.I called VIZIO Customer support, worked with them for over 30 minutes and they blamed the problem totally on the camera. They said that I needed to get into the camera settings and change the output to something different to get the 373 to play it. There are NO tweaks in the camera that can be changed to something different to accomodate the 373's technical problem. Yet, VIZIO insists the problem is the fault of the camera and that I need to contact the manufacturer and find out how to change, hack, or tweak it's output to meet the needs of the 373. Of course that might then make the camera incompatible with other fully compatible and capable displays, including VIZIO's own models.\"Alice in South Dakota, Badge 547\" refused to escalate the incident and said there was nothing VIZIO could do to assist me. It will be interesting to see what the camera manufacturer has to say, consindering they are one of the two finest names in their field!My new \"Motto\" suggestion for VIZIO is \"Not My Fault.\" I am updating the rating I gave them in several related areas after this latest encounter.I would certainly NEVER acquire this VIZIO model used or in the obsolete model market. I also would recommend avoiding VIZIO products having seen how much time it requires to get them to step up to their responsibilities. And then there are the times when they just walk away from addressing an issue.======Following is the earlier review, but yo may have already heard enough about VIZIO products=======NOTE: Numerous UPDATES regarding issues with this model have been moved to the end of this extensive owner experience review.Apologies that the review is long, but it is based on an informed evaluation. If you want something quick and dirty, look elsewhere. You'll find LOTs out there :-) I already know some people have benefited from what I share, especially those to whom this is a major investment and they want to make an informed choice. Of course this is history now, since the 373 seems to have come and gone now. However, I do see that some on the annoying problems of this unit are shared in a variety of VIZIO displays of varying sizes. Some of the areas of concern relative to features and vendor reliability will be of value in future purchases.I don't do comparison reviews or make recommendations since my reviews are in depth of products with which I have extensive experience. I'm NOT a review wonk. Finally, I ended up keeping this model because VIZIO finally provided a new replacement that didn't have the HDMI scrambling problem. No other brand 37\" unit was available that would fit in the custom cabinetry. The picture is excellent even if the user interface is poorly designed and executed. My \"star\" ratings have been updated to reflect the final evaluation. Vendor Service for VIZIO rates two stars.=================I did not purchase this TV from Amazon but from another online retailer. This TV was top choice for me in a situation where I had to have a device that would fit inside an existing piece of furniture. In the size aspect, this TV rates a \"10\" for my needs. It fits in a cabinet with an 1/8th to spare on either side! The picture is very good and the overall look is clean. Thin was no big deal for me, but this one rates high in that area.I am writing this review to cover some of the aspects of the XVT373SV 37\" RazorLED LCD HDTV (coming from the perspective of an ex-electronics tech and someone very familiar with electronics and user interface capabilities) to give others a balanced idea of overall quality and performance relative to your needs. I have seen a variety of commercial reviews (not comments here) that I think reprint boilerplate and are not based on actual use over time. In many ways this is a good TV, however at the typical price point it is hardly up to snuff when it comes to day to day use by people who read the manual and know the difference between a mediocre picture and one that is set-up properly.Over-the-air HDTV is very good with an appropriate antenna. However, changing channels is a very SLOOOOW process. Maybe that is true with all modern HDTVs with this feature set?The User Interface is horrible in multiple areas. This is very troubling as it is probably the easiest thing to do right since there are good interfaces out there and, theoretically, if can be fixed through a firmware upgrade. It has not been as of Version 3.nnn of the firmware. Next to actually watching something on the unit, the User Interface is where you will spend the largest amount of time. Expect to spend even more time in the VIZIO RazorLED interface unless VIZIO decides to fix numerous problems in the interface design. Here are a couple highlights, or lowlights:Our smaller two year old VIZIO can easily change the screen aspect ratio (Normal, Zoom, etc.) but with the XVT373SV you have to go into the menu system, highlight the option and then choose the correct display. And you are doing with a display reduced in size in some weird manner so until you exit the menu completely you are never certain if you have the correct setting or not. Really annoying, inferior design even compared to older and cheaper VIZIO products. Here is to hoping for a fix in a firmware update. It wasn't in the latest 3.0nnn version, but the startup on-screen logo has changed!Making picture adjustments is incredibly difficult for these times. It is amazing how deep VIZIO's crack software usability team has buried key settings regarding the picture. Those adjustments (color, frame rate, \"motion enhancement\" etc.) are buried several levels deeper in the user interface than the display aspect ratio settings.AMAZING: Having pressed the MENU button it requires 16 key presses to just get to the listing of items to adjust the picture! If the family wants to watch a movie you will learn to start the movie and do the setup ahead of time to avoid having a very early intermission.Note that this 120 Hz unit can display the \"Soap Opera Effect\" to a very high degree. (Google it if you don't know what it is.) You'll be watching a superb film but it looks like a much lower-budget, less artistic, video production. You will need to go on a journey through the Advance Picture settings and, from what I have been able to test, make sure the \"Smooth Motion Effect\" is turned off. I hope that someday more info will be available about \"Real Cinema Mode\" (see below) and Film Mode.Changing the INPUT is, thankfully, directly accessible from a button on the remote. Why not the display mode? Maybe even an assignable button or two is called for on this \"Premium\" remote?VIZIO has located Setup options access in two radically different places. One is through the remote's Menu button and another is found in the VIA Dock, the docking menu that appears when you hit the VIA logo button in the middle of the remote.Confession time, I am a manual reader. I want to get the most from any high technology device and I've also written technical documentation for end-users. Just where you need it most, the manual contains virtually \"information-free\" verbiage. I see the \"Real Cinema Mode\" option and want to know why I might use it or what it does or how to set it up. Here is what VIZIO shares in the manual: \"The Real Cinema Mode option allows selection of the type of compensation used for the Smooth MotionTM Effect option. Choose from Off, Precision and Smooth.\" Gee, thanks for clearing that up! It is almost as though the writer could not find anyone who knew what the darn thing does. I printed an extra copy of the manual just to make reminder notes!Bugs???Shortly after getting the TV we added a new Sony Blu-ray. When the Blu-ray and the TV and turned on and I play a DVD or Blu-ray the TV displays a horrible scrambling of the video. This is in 1080P mode. The audio also cuts out in the worst of the scrambling. Thinking the issue was with the Blu-ray (after swapping out the Sony HMDI cable with a higher quality one and also trying different HMDI inputs) I exchanged for a different Sony of the same model but a couple months newer manufacture. To my surprise the problem continued. The VIZIO has NEVER exhibited this problem with any input other than the Sony Blu-ray. I'm left to believe it is a compatibility issue between this model Sony Blu-ray or one of the settings for output and something in the VIZIO. The strangest part is that the problem fades in 3 to 6 minutes and DOES NOT RETURN as long as everything is running. It may be some sort of heat related issue in the VIZIO circuitry.UPDATE: This turned out to be a unit defect, experienced by many others. Eventually VIZIO did swap out this defective unit for a new unit.Feature confusion:Although it is possible to dig deep enough (which I did before making the purchase) material on the VIZIO XVT373SV HDTV, including information on VIZIO's specific product website, is confusing in stating that this unit has smart dimming to enhance black levels. It DOES NOT have local dimming. Local dimming is not supported by the edge lit design in the smaller size units like my 37\". The larger models in this RazorLED series do appear to support actual local dimming to further enhance the black levels. On my unit we found the way VIZIO implemented dimming to be annoying and distracting. The only time it seemed to do much was in a full screen credit roll at the end of a Blu-ray movie. In parts where a major credit would leave the screen before the next one appeared the TV would have a little pause, then the backlight would virtually go off and a \u00bd second later as the next credit appeared the screen would suddenly flash to life making the black level very evident. Since this unit has respectable black levels we just turned that \"feature\" off. I have seen real local dimming in action and it is a unique way to achieve amazing dynamic range.The USB ports did NOTHING in the first release. One of the later software releases finally sees thumb drives with images and will do a rudimentary slide show. When you end the show it is necessary to unplug and replug the USB drive to see it seen again.The VIA applications (again as of firmware V 3.nnn) are incredibly lame in comparison to a Sony Blu-ray player we were given at Christmas. Having Netflix is nice, especially with the way media content is evolving. The Sony Blu-ray has almost as many CATEGORIES in Internet accessed content as VIA has in individual sources. I haven't counted this but I would estimate that the Sony Internet content interface has 20 to 40 TIMES as many content sources as VIA.Annoyances and quirks:Especially for one that is ballyhooed as a \"Premium Remote,\" the design is only mediocre. The button locations and assignments continually evade me, but maybe that is an individual issue.One nice feature is that you can assign a remote to a specific input and the VIZIO remote will automatically be able to control some basic functions on your Blu-ray, DVD or even Xbox. Why they call this function Device Setup instead of Remote setup is another usability annoyance. Unfortunately, the functionality seems to have been very poorly thought out. I set the VIZIO remote up to control our disc player. When I switched the TV to the disc input it was no longer possible to access the menu of the TV! The MENU button on the VIZIO remote, needed to change almost anything in the screen, video or audio settings, instead made the DVD's Menu pop up for the disc in play! It was IMPOSSIBLE to access the VIZIO TV's menu to change screen aspect ratio or any of the needed settings for various discs! Oops VIZIO! Since the various settings are tied to the input mode, it was not possible to just go to another input, make the change, and return. It was necessary to switch to a different Input, then go to Device Setup for all the inputs and disable it for the disc player! This function is basically unusable. VIZIO does now have a workaround but it makes getting to the TV menu even more cumbersome.Inputs can have custom labels assigned. I do wish they could be longer than 10 characters. There is more than enough room on screen even though the \"generic\" title of the input continues to appear also.The Auto channel scan seems OK. I do wish I could have a setting there to choose to only include digital (or analog) channels. There is a partial channel search that allows this functionality, BUT it leaves in channels that we previously found and have changes. Being able to receive over-the-air HDTV from both Chicago and Milwaukee it means a lot of rescanning as new channels are always going on line and there has been a lot of shuffling. I'd like a feature to delete all channels and run a selective scan.The remote has a slide out QWERTY keyboard, but it too is mediocre. Most things you do with the keyboard will also require you to go back to the main remote so it really isn't all that convenient. I live by a Smartphone and the keyboard is far inferior, even though 2 to 3 times larger, than any Smartphone I've used. My current small BlackBerry keyboard is far superior to actually type something in.So, at the current version of the updated firmware I would have to say, keeping in mind the typical price point, that this TV is technically average, perhaps above average, but the User interface, access to functionality, and content of the documentation is sadly lacking or flawed. With some major changes, especially through the firmware, this TV could be \"a contender.\"UPDATES CONCERNING UNIT DEFECTS:UPDATE 2011-01-26: A new wrinkle appeared today as VIZIO Technical support finally confirmed (after quite some time testing, re-birthing/resetting my TV to factory defaults and confirming it had the latest firmware) that the problem with Blu-ray distortion is a defect in this VIZIO TV. Three Blu-ray player exchanges later, multiple cable brand tests, and testing of all the HDMI inputs and disconnecting of all other devices. . .it is a problem with a defective VIZIO TV. [A sequence of images showing the problem have been added to the webpage. Click on \"View and share related images\" below the picture of the VIZIO XVT373SV]Even though this new set is now confirmed defective by VIZIO the most VIZIO will do is \"send out a repair person for in-home repair.\"I told the VIZIO customer service person that I would be much more comfortable with an exchange, even refurbished, than having a the repair person visit and work on repairing it. There was absolutely no willingness on the part of VIZIO to provide customer satisfaction when a lengthy problem turned out to be caused by their defective VIZIO product. That's not what I expected from a company that BRANDS themselves as, \"America's Number One Hi-Def TV Company\" and \"The Home of Entertainment Freedom for All.\" Maybe that's the difference between \"Branding\" a company and \"Building\" a company? To me \"Home Entertainment Freedom\" now means that in the future be smarter to try a different vendor.I reduced this VIZIO's rating to 1 STAR based on VIZIO's support in correcting this issue.I told the VIZIO Agent I wanted to follow up with Sam's Club On-line before setting up a repair appointment. NO service tech, how qualified or trained, will have access to the resources available when a set is truly \"refurbished\" and tested at a vendor authorized facility.To me it was paying the \"brand spanking new price\" for a set but ending up with a repaired unit inferior to a refurbished one!I called Sam's On-line and their customer service didn't hesitate to begin an exchange for a new unit of the same model. I'm impressed that Sam's Club is covering for a failure of VIZIO to deliver Customer Satisfaction. I hope Sam's makes VIZIO pay for their dropping the ball!UPDATE 2011-02-12: A replacement XVT373SV arrived, provided by VIZIO. VIZIO decided than an exchange for a new unit was justified. BTW, I was still waiting for SAM's Online to follow through with their promise when VIZIO contacted me by phone.After a day of testing the replacement from VIZIO does not exhibit the HDMI signal distortion that the first TV does. If you want to see the annotated screenshots of the problem click on \"View and share related images\" below the picture of the VIZIO XVT373SV. I also plugged a thumbdrive with JPG images on it in one of the USB ports and after a while the TV reported it had found a content source connected to the USB port and presented a menu where I could play the content. The slide show worked fine. Last time I tried this the previous TV didn't ever respond to the insertion of a thumbdrive.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value/price for 120Hz LED backlit, 802.11n wireless, more", "Author": "M.

The TV is also directly connected to the internet.Contrary to another review decrying an overly-complex user interface, I found quite the opposite to be true.  In essence the instruction manual says \"install the base, put in place, plug it in, turn it on, and the TV itself will guide you through the rest of the setup.\"  True!  Utterly painless, no hitches or hassles or restarts.  About five minutes to get the input sources plugged in and registered and I'm off Web surfing with the biggest monitor I've ever owned.  Oh, and the DVD player works, too.  The next morning I turned it on and it downloaded its firmware and software updates before coming to life.  The thing is a computer in itself.Sound is pretty good, too, for TV speakers.  With my old TV I used a pair of high-end computer speakers instead of the TV speakers so that I could hear and understand voices clearly, not needed with this set.Even using analog inputs from the DVD player, the picture is much sharper than on the previous CRT TV.I haven't tried any of the Web apps that are built into it, or cable or aerial TV, and likely won't (that's not what I bought it for), so I can't comment on any of that.  Ditto the 802.11n wireless as it's plugged directly into my router.The only feature that's goofy is the knob on side for presets.  First of all, I don't intend to control the TV other than with the remote control.

I thought there was some way to adjust it, we searched the set up info that came with it and there is no way to adjust it. So we emailed the Vizio company and they also said there is no way to adjust it. They said we purchased a TV that was too small for the distance we were sitting from it. We were suppose to have at least a 40\" when sitting 10ft. from the TV. Well, I can tell you, I couldn't even see this text on a 40\" TV unless we were sitting 5 feet from it.I researched and researched Tvs and read reviews on many TV before we purchased this one. NONE of the reviews said anything about the text being so small. So maybe it doesn't bother most people....but it makes me crazy !Otherwise ....

This can easily save you anywhere from $60-$90, depending on the third party seller.  In any case here's what I have to say about the tv.  The picture is excellent and the applications are fun, especially the netflix and facebook apps. The sound could be a bit better, but it really differs going from web applications to an external video source so you'll have to program the settings accordingly.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product but I do have a warning or two for weary shoppers.Initially I did have a problem or two with the television:  Video and sound didn't sync quite perfectly (this is more so the case for an external device rather than the web applications), even after messing with the settings I could never get it quite perfect.  However, you really have to look for it to see it and it's never really noticable.  In fact, I often forget about it completely.Note for those using an external device such as a PS3 or other blu-ray/HD player.  The tv will repeatedly try to upgrade the picture on regular DVDs from 480i (or whatever resolution it was filmed in) up to 720p-1080p.  This tv doesn't really support lower resolutions for 480, so it'll give you problems.  When watching older DVDs such as those filmed in 480i there is a noticable and annoying glitch.  The tv will flash a pink and green color briefly and then go black (the whole process lasts 1-2 seconds) and it will do this every 5-20 minutes.  My television stopped this after I started using an HDMI cable.  Really, you should be using an HDMI cable anyway.  The picture is FAR better. Bottom line:  Do not use AV cable's to try and display picture from an HD source. At least not with this television.So the quick summary: Picture-Excellent (be sure to get an HDMI cable if you're using an HD video source). Sound-Pretty good (could be better at times, audiophiles may want an external source such as surround sound). Glitches-One or two (above, an this may not occur with everyone's model), but both are easily fixed. Overall- A cool tv for the average person (like myself) and I'm definitely happy with it.  For you extreme videophiles out there who will bicker over tiny details, you may want to add a bit of money to the price tag and shoot for a higher end Sony or Samsung, but for those of us who want a good tv and are on a budget this is perfectly fine.

Cowden", "ReviewID": "R3GF0KY77MO5ZT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought this as a family Christmas.  Packaging was very good and the setup was very easy using the on screen instructions.  Picture quality is fantastic.  Audio is OK but is very good when you use an external sound system.  The remote integrates with a DVD and VCR very nicely.  I was a bit disappointed with the lack of channel organization features.  My older, lower quality flat screen that we bought three years ago for another room allows you to attach labels to channels and to organize channels into groups.  This is a very handy feature when you use cable.  I was surprised that this TV did not have anything like that.  The internet apps are also rather space.  You can check Yahoo news and Yahoo weather, lots of things like that, but I have not found anything really valuable and there is not general browser.About 2 months into our use, the remote started working only intermittently.  We did the obvious things (batteries and such) to no end.  The remote is a rather complex device and has a slide out keyboard.  We found that if we messed around with the remote and jiggled the keyboard, we could eventually get the remote to work for a while, but then it would stop again.  You really need the remote to operate this TV.  The manual control is located in and odd spot on the side of the TV, is difficult to use, and performs only the most basic functions.  I contacted product support.  This is where things started to go downhill.  They sent a problem solving guide which leads you through the basic troubleshooting (batteries, repairing the remote with the TV...).  At the end of the guide, it said that if your problem was still not solved, call customer support.  I did that and was told that I first needed to send in proof of purchase and then the remote would be replaced.  I send in proof of purchase in the manner instructed and thought I was set.  Four days later, I got an e-mail saying that customer support was waiting on my call.  I was confused but made the call.  They said that they had received my proof of purchase and wanted to know what I needed.  I was annoyed but again explained the problem.  They said that they would charge my credit card $60 for a new remote but then refund it when they received the defective remote in return.  Again, I was annoyed but made the arrangement.  10 days later, I had still not received the remote co I called customer support again.  After being on hold for quite some time, they said that my case had been cancelled because the last person that I talked to had entered the wrong shipping method.  I was stunned.  They said that I could still get my remote replaced but that we would need to start over.  So we went through the whole deal again.  7 days later, I still did not have the replacement part, so I called yet again and was told that I needed to understand that the order required up to 5 days to process and up to 10 days to ship but I should be happy because the system showed that my order had been approved.  4 days later, I received the remote.  So it took 3 weeks from the time I reported the problem for me to receive the replacement part.  I should note two additional things.  This was not a customer support center in another country; the call center was in the US.  Also, I think that they must be having serious issues with these remotes because the pre-printed return shipping label that was included had \"Remote Return Department\" above the address.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding...and I researched many TVs", "Author": "D.

I bought it to be used as a huge monitor for my laptop with HDMI output, that doesn't work too well. But it serve right for my PS3 gaming and Blu-ray movies with only little flaws.First major thing I want to talk about is its input lag. The TV suffers an input lag when connected with my computor via HDMI connection. The lag is not servere, but noticable. I can feel it by just moving my mouse around. I have not run a hardcore computer shooter game to test it, but I can imagine it would not work well for that purpose. If you just want to use it for internet browsing, it is toleratable. However, it is too bright for reading text. I cannot stand staring at the very bright background while reading on this TV. Also, if you have a computer speaker with only mini-jack speakers, and you want to use them, this TV does not allow it. But if you have a nicer speaker set with optical connection, then it is fine. So in general, not recommended for computer user.Second thing I will talk about is using it for PS3. I played God of War 3 and FIFA on this TV with my PS3 via HDMI. Have not noticed any functional defect or flaws. The speakers on the TV are actually better than I expected, don't sound too bad. However when I watch Blu-ray movie with lights off, during dark sences, I can easily notice some LED bleed on one corner of the screen. Luckily it is not too obivious, so with room lights on, and normal non-dark scence, it would not be an issue.After talking about two flaws, I would also like to comment on the Apps. The apps are OK, not as good as I expected. I was expecting it would include an enbeded web-browser, but it does not. All the apps are just some gadgets developed by Yahoo! Very limited, and not that impressive. Esspecially the Facebook gadget, it's only for decoration. But I am satisfied with the Netflix gadget, it wokrs well, and it is truely HD. Have to say, the wireless feature of this TV also make life a lot easier. The keyboard remote is cool, but it's kind of useless. At least after the first few days I had some fun with it, I did not use it at all.I already called the customer service for product return. But afterward I did a research for different replacement of this TV, and the result is no better replacement. The one that might be simillar to this TV would be the Samsung UN32C6500VF, it is 32', much more expensive, and suffers exact same problems with this TV and even worse according to the user reviews. So now I am not sure if I should return this TV any more.My recommendation would be try the 42' Vizio XVT423SV if your space permits. It has far superior specs but only 2~300 dollars more.

I will say, as a TV producer and editor, I stare at HD quality images all day and, as you can imagine, a tad anal about quality.  I was blown away by this TV.  This is an extra set in a family room, my others are Samsung in the \"Theater\" room and Sony in bedroom.  I bought this lesser known Vizio brand to save some $$, but I can honestly say- this set is just as good as my higher priced LCD/Plasma sets both in my home and my video studio.What is awesome is, this HD set only has my SD(standard def) cable box connected to it, but somehow the picture looks HD! especially when using NetFlix for movies, etc. The sound quality is perfectly fine for most applications.  The only drawback I find is the so-called \"Internet Ready\" farce. Everyone should know that \"Internet Ready\" DOES NOT mean you can get on line and surf the net, check email, etc.  I misunderstood, seriously thinking that through it's wireless connection to my home internet service, I could literally surf the net. NOT!- all you can do is utilize the web services that VIZIO has contracted with and they are pre-programmed.  You can go to their Yahoo News channel or HULU, etc.  but cannot enjoy the internet like you would on a computer.  I feel marketing it as an \"Internet Ready\" is totally misleading.  But again, shame on me for not asking more questions.Overall I would highly recommend this set to everyone... especially Amazon's price as it was $200 less than most other on-line retailers.

It worked flawlessly right out of the box. It picked up my Wireless-N signal - just had to enter the access code.A few minor comments: (1) You can't mount this TV flush onto the wall; Vizio says so in the documentation. Minimum space is about 1 1/2\" (the TV has some ventilation vents on the back that shouldn't be blocked and then Vizio has the AC cord coming out of the back..with a right angle C13 plug that protrudes about 1\"). (2) The design is uninspired - square, sharp corners, 1 3/4\" wide frame around the picture is probably larger than needed.

I have been looking at it for awhile. I was worried when it got sold out on Amazon, they claimed a 3-5 weeks wait. I had to purchase it from one of the Marketplace stores. However, annoyingly amazon had it available the day after I purchased. Even though it was just $30 more where I bought it, I would have rather taken amazon's return/refund policy and it's cheaper shipping as a prime member.Well on to the TV. Just what everyone else says. Picture is great, light, slim. It's is definitely a bedroom TV unless you have a small living room. Internet apps are good. It has all I want LED, WIFI N built in, Internet Apps.UpdateI just wanted to add a couple more things after using for two weeks. The remote is powerful and easy to setup with other devices but missing a few things.- There should be a button to switch tv/external device. For example, I was able to get the remote to control the cable box but it means when on cable you cannot easily access the tv settings. The only way is to go to Apps -> HDTV settings. I was initially confused why the had HDTV settings as an app but I now believe it is solely because of the remote lack of an extra button. This means it takes too many clicks to do simple things.- Another issue is the lack of ALL Power button. You have to remember to turn off the external device before you turn off the tv, or it wont work. An All power off/on button would have fixed that issue.- A backlight for the remote control.Bonus - it's a bad idea to make play control buttons (fastfoward, rewind, play, stop) exactly the same or worse no space between them.  We naturally press buttons without looking. I find myself always having to look to make sure I have the play button when fast fowarding a program.Debated bumping down my review, but I don't think remote issues should overshadow the other great things.

I just could not fit a TV in that was larger than 37 inches.

This set had all the higher end features I was looking for like LED edge backlighting, 120 Hz refresh rate and built in Wi-Fi and internet access which I use to stream movies from Netflix.  To that end, the TV remote has a slide out full keyboard which makes it easy enter text when doing a search for a movie etc. or for anything requiring typed input.  Better than moving a pointer over a picture of an on screen keyboard and using up / down arrows to type.Without having to use the remote most of the basic TV functions can be selected from the TV itself using an ingenious jog wheel on the left edge of the TV.  You push the wheel to bring up the menu and then rotate it to move through the choices, pressing it again selects the feature wanted.There are not many downsides to this TV.  The sound quality isn't terrible, but could be better, probably as good as can be expected for small, built in speakers.  Fine for everyday viewing, but for movies you really want to use a home theater sound system, the TV speakers just don't make the grade here.

So far, the picture is outstanding (after being properly set up) and the price was also great. The speakers are tinny with no bass whatsoever, on par with laptop speakers, but I don't think anyone expects anything better than that from a modern flat screen. I'm sure most manufactures use bad speakers intentionally to sell more add on speakers.With that said, I spent over an hour networking it. It did not connect to my (brand new) Netgear WNR2000v3 router right away. Instead, after messing with the types of encryption and broadcast settings of my router to know avail, I searched online to hoping to find someone with my exact same problem. The solution was to use a static IP to connect to the router. This is rather silly in my opinion, since I have connected 3 different computers (running Vista, Windows 7, and ubuntu), an iphone and a 2 year old droid phone to the router without having to resort to such things. One must use a static IP even for the wired connection. This is further compounded by the overall crumminess of the remote and operating system of the tv. Every operation presents the user with a spinning pinwheel to tell you its working for 30 seconds. Yes, I entered the password wrong because the flip out keyboard has cheap buttons and its difficult to tell if you actually pressed them or not, I know it won't connect, you don't have to spend 30 seconds doing the spinning pinwheel each time.The Vizio Internet Apps platform is decent. For the most part its junk like yahoo news which I can use a real computer to read. The Netflix app will get a lot of use and is easy to navigate. One can download more apps, which I looked at, but for the most part they are tacky garbage like sudoku and \"de smet jesuit high school\". Hulu plus and Blockbuster instant video are supposed to be available, but I could not find them. Perhaps Vizio is restricting access to these so that only people purchasing the newest tvs can see them? I don't know.My final thoughts: this tv is good enough that I won't have to return it. I bought it to watch netflix, play xbox and watch the occasional dvd it looks like it does those things just fine. I would have liked the Hulu Plus app to be available but its not a big deal.

I have to swap out a couple of devices.It has  a few USB inputs and the box it came in implies that you can use those to play your own media, but perhaps they don't have that in the firmware yet, because the TV doesn't recognize my USB flash drive and there's nothing in the manual about how to make it play those.

(The set does automatically download firmware updates when connected to the Internet.)It's a well-designed TV in spite of the minor quibbles and thus deserves 5 stars.  I agree with the other reviewer who recommended a larger version but we didn't want to replace our cabinet.

There's also a lag, which I could deal with, when turning it on and starting some of the widgets...sort of like a computer. It definitely makes it look bad and feel like a budget brand. I contacted Vizio customer service and went through trouble shooting for the dark shadow: unplugging, holding the power button for 30 seconds, and turning it back on and, when that didn't work, restoring to factory defaults. When that didn't fix it, they offered to open a case which involves correspondence and sending pictures. Considering this is a brand new TV, I wasn't up to the hassle so this is going back. Since I had to pick the TV up from UPS because I'm at work during the day and can't be home for delivery, I'll be buying a new TV (not Vizio) from a local store.

At the time, Vizio's reputation was more of producing low priced TVs than high quality TVs.  (I hasten to add I now understand Vizio does not manufacture televisions, they spec them out to be manufactured under their name.)  Based on the early reviews of this model I purchased mine from a warehouse club, not Amazon.The TV was easy to set-up, but the stand is definitely on the rickety/unstable side.  It supports the TV fine if you leave it alone, but if you go move the TV for any reason you are instantly reminded that it is not a substantial stand.  The on-screen set up guide was quite easy to go through, including pairing the bluetooth remote.  My TV connected without issue to my wireless networking system.  It has always been in same room as my router so signal strength has always been excellent as expected given it's location.  One annoying thing is that to from wired to wireless connection, or the reverse, you can't just change something in the menu, you must reinitialize the TV. It's only a minor inconvenience, but an avoidable one.After I adjusted settings to get contrast and brightness, etc. where I wanted it and to remove the SOE (soap opera effect), the picture quality has been surprisingly excellent.  It is now the longest tenured TV in my home because of its picture quality...I'm almost afraid to replace it.  The Vizio is located in my computer room and probably gets more use than any other TV as I enjoy watching television while looking for things to buy/read/watch on the internet.  During its tenure, it's picture has bested a Sony XBR 6 series, a Sony KDL EX700 Series, a Vizio E series, a Panasonic LCD and two LG LA6200 series...the picture really is that good.  In fact I bought the Vizio E for another room based on my experience with this unit, but returned the E as it was definitely lacking.  That's when I learned about where Vizio sources its TVs.I like the all black finish to the TV as I dislike the trend of trimming TVs with silver (a negative about the new Vizio M series).  The thickness of the frame looks dated now, but at the time it was a very nicely styled TV.I have had no problems with the Vizio other than some rebooting incidents.  I researched that issue quite extensively and believe it was the result of applications updating.This was also my first smart TV.  Streaming through Netflix or Amazon has always been free of incident.  The interface is a bit dated, but is still perfectly functional.To me this TV has performed well beyond all expectations and definitely caused me to rethink my opinion of Vizio products.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV!", "Author": "Sheila", "ReviewID": "R3UN0EK1B37QJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this television for almost a year now and I love it.

I'd have to wait a few minutes before it would let me turn it on.  After doing some research I found that it looks like that is a known bug and happens when an App tries to update itself at the same time (over the same connection) as another app is being used.

I bought this TV as a master bedroom TV, but first used it at my shore house for the summer. Pandora, Rhapsody, Amazon VOD, and Netflix were used all day long and functioned flawlessly. The remote with sliding QWERTY keyboard is incredibly useful as is the wizard that helps you set up your other components (cable box, receiver, etc.)The speakers are impressive for a flat-panel with good separation and decent volume, although I have the sound going through a 5.1 Onkyo setup via the optical audio out on the TV. Having 4 HDMI inputs is great because it allows me to use the TV for all AV switching and has made the lack of HDMI inputs on my receiver a non-issue.After using this TV in the shore house for 4 months I have since moved it to it's permanent home on the wall of my bedroom. This made me appreciate the matte (non-glossy) finish of the screen even more as there are 2 enormous windows on the wall facing the TV.

Once I actually got to the new TV it took me about 2 hours to hook it up and access all the standard stuff. This was all the setup of the channels and the internet and playing with the remote and add-on keyboard. I was impressed with the picture quality, sound and all the features that I tried. Everything worked. I did have a few problems but they were mine. One: I had to re-configure my router which was set up wrong. Two: setting up the channels. I thought they would just be ready to go, NOT! This is where reading the instructions are a must, if you're not familiar with the newer Digital TV's. I have not tried any external devices so can't comment on anything other than the TV and internet which works great.

I hope this TV will last several years and run trouble free, only time will tell.ON SET UP:I would read the instructions first before hooking up anything. Also, slow down and take your time when you start the actual hookup and programming of the devise!If your \"NOT\" a techy and are having trouble understanding the instructions, get some help. This could save you lost of time and frustration on this new toy. In most cases I have found that I was the problem, not the devise. There have been cases that I did send a produce back but that was after talking to the company's support service groups. I did have a monitor that was dead right out of the box and it didn't require any service calls!Good LuckUpdate: 7/17/11Last night after signing up for Netflix's I thought this is as good a time as any to see if it was worth the cost of the new TV. I already watch some movies online on the PC but not good, for a family setting.  I watched two movies and was pleased at the quality over the wireless feed from the router. The streaming video on the 37\" screen was great. I also tried my external DVD and VCR devices and they all preformed as expected, no problems. This set is really nice for family viewing or with friends.  I also muted the TV speakers and used my surround-sound system which also worked without problems. The only things left to try, is the USB ports and the RGB computer connection and audio out for earphones.There are some things I wish Vizio would have done to make the TV more user friendly. Putting the USB and RGB ports on the front of the TV would help. My TV sits in a cabinet that holds my DVD and VCR players and I will have to buy a USB hub so I can get access. On the RGB port I will have to use a short pigtail to have access from the front of the TV. Adding an earphone jack too and an AGC control so the audio doesn't go through the roof on commercials should have been a no brainer! Thank God for the \"Mute\" button!The remote control:The remote control could have a couple more buttons to make things easier but overall and for the price of this TV does give you good features. In some cases you have to go a few levels into the menu to do what you want but it's not a big deal once you get use to how the overall menu is laid out. I'm still playing with the remote and other features that I may or may not use. The added keyboard on the remote was a fantastic idea. This add-on alone makes the remote!

We will definitely take this suggestion and pass it on. Thanks for your post.\"Marketing-wise, us regular (or even geeky) consumers who didn't know that \"back-lit = no screen burn\" a \"screen saver would = peace of mind\", plus a smart choice for their branding team.Being that even the inexpensive AppleTV offers a screen saver, I wonder why Vizio would not provide screen saver options in their settings:  From photo personalization slide shows with services like Picasa/Google Photo, to individual transfer via USB drive or even the branding-reinforcing Vizio Logo flying around.By the way, my TV shipped without a TV control and it was my 1st experience with Amazon's Customer Service (default answer is ship it back, which is not what customer wants to hear after spending time connecting TV and setting on one's shelves,) fortunately they reimbursed me some $ to be buy the control from a 3rd party vendor (intra-Amazon,) though Qwerty keyboard control was not easy to find (avid web shopper/searcher).Good value so far. \"Like\" Vizio to get better know-how, because their website does not have all the answers (May 2010), they'd benefit from an on-site user forum at least to know about firmware updates. No matter what they told me I hope they add a screen saver in next firmware, I want to assume they update their firmware and notify customers or give them the choice to update, the way AppleTV does.I'm also hoping they'll increase the number of apps one can have in the app gallery at the bottom, or even decrease the size of the app logo in order to fit more.If your TV ships without the Qwerty keyboard call vendor right away, for without it you can do little to NONE (i.e initial set up).Technoir.infoMay 2011ps I'm hoping their firmware updates apply to all their smart TV's an not only the higher-end ones or Blu Ray players.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great product, fair price, excellent value", "Author": "Joe B", "ReviewID": "R264LAM4COHADJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I held out for a HDTV for many years never giving up on my old 27\" Sony Trinitron, which by the way will remain in the household destined the 2nd floor TV room as it still works great.

It replaced a 20\" CRT TV. I am so thankful I decided to spend a bit extra for the 37\". I can't imagine how hard it would be to view text on anything smaller (and our bedroom is typical middle-class size).We got this primarily for the apps. Sure, our Dish Network connects into it, but we watch a lot of Netflix. We browsed the other apps and found quite a wealth of interesting entertainment. Some apps are more useful than others (Pandora, AccuWeather were nice and useful; Facebook was a nice idea for checking your wall, but typing with the remote's slideout keyboard is a bit slow...but doable). We have 802.11n wireless that involves two base stations (Apple Airport Extreme gets the high speed Internet from the 10mb/s CenturyLink DSL, and then we have a 2nd Apple Airport Express used to extend the network to the other end of the house (1-story). This HDTV has 802.11n (fastest available for consumers) and it had absolutely no trouble finding and connecting to the network (prompted for the password). I get 5 bars on the HDTV's reception of the WIFI signal, so Netflix looks awesome, as do the apps.Up until now, I've only owned Samsung HDTVs. I have a top-of-the-line Samsung LED backlit 46\" in the family room that is about as perfect a picture you can get. But for the bedroom, I didn't want to spend nearly as much. I've been skeptical on Vizio up until now, but their recent models (2010 onward) have really ramped up on quality but kept the cost down. So with amazon's great return policy on TVs, we tried this. Picture quality is superb. Audio is very weak (no low-end as expected for such a thin TV). Remote is quite cool with the keyboard and is a bit chunkier than most because of it...but it is useful. Note the remote uses Bluetooth to talk with the TV, so it was a bit glitchy at first trying to get the two \"paired\", but it worked itself out.There are some pretty picky people reviewing this and the 32\" model (which is identical in every way, except for size of screen). The TV's menus are fine. Sure, there are some clicks, but I found what I needed to adjust the picture as needed. In fact, it didn't come out of the box set for the showroom. It was on a pretty decent setting. I tweaked a few things, but nothing major.The one thing that bugged me a bit was the bezel (frame) around the screen. It was flimsy. On one side, I could even separate it from the TV a bit, as it appears some sort of latch wasn't holding it tight against the TV. It's not enough to return it and this wasn't from damage during shipment. The stand is also a bit flimsy too, and it has to be assembled to the TV when you first get it. It attaches with one (1) screw to the TV. So it's not as sturdy as some stands I've seen. This can be mounted to the wall, but I already had a stand in the bedroom.I wouldn't pay $700+ for this (caught amazon napping and they dropped the price for a day to around $620...less than the 32\" that day), but the feature set is amazing for the price they do offer...and it all works as advertised.", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV", "Author": "John Sherry \"SLOJES\"", "ReviewID": "R3PLM28NEKJ2LR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A 37\" screen was the max I could fit and since Sony doesn't make a 37, I was choosing between the Vizio, Samsung and Panasonic.

This is my first HDTV and I didn't have an HD signal, or even digital. I had DirectTV installed a few days later and WOW! The picture is stunning. I can't imagine a picture any better, and that is TV channels in HD. I don't have a blueray player yet and have watched one movie on our old DVD player and it looked fantastic. I can't imagine what true blueray would look like. Regarding the internet apps, so far they seem so-so. I have watched 2 movies via netflix, one looked good, and one was pretty badly pixilated on motion, but watchable. I have it hooked up direct to the network cable now, but I believe the first movie I watched was with the wifi, which connected to the network easily. I have to check to see if for some reason wifi handles the download better than the cat5 cable, which would seem odd. Facebook, is kind of minimal, and I haven't checked out the other apps.

Every few days I'll have to reset my router for some reason. It sees the network but same thing happens with my laptop. Think it's an IVp6 issue. Downloads needed updates by itself which is lovely. Has a sweet a$% logo on screen when you power on that looks like a transformer Decepticon logo. Quality and design are excellent. The apps are fine. Mostly impressed with the Pandora app because there are no adds and it doesn't stop playing if you leave it on, shows album work and has a nice thumbs up/down rating option on each song that plays. Also love the Amazon Instant Video app and how the remote control works like a DVD remote. The remote feels like cheap plastic, but it works fine and has a nice slide out keyboard. Netfilx and Hulu Plus apps work fine but the Hulu Plus navigation and video search is not designed well. Has tons of Yahoo Aps like weather, news, traffic, sports, fantasy football. Also Blockbuster and Facebook apps. Speakers are great but nothing fancy. They just sound good (don't expect bass, but mids/hi's are actually good).

Shipping was fast and easy, luckily I was home when it was delivered but in any other case I would not have trusted anyone to just drop a TV off at my house and leave. Assembly on the stand (I did use the stand it came with) took no more than a few seconds and was not flimsy. The setup was fast and easy as would be any system like a WII or XBOX. The walkthrough was fast, simple and within 10 minutes I had Netflix setup and watching movies. The wi-fi is simple and I do not have the dvr connected as this is in a seperate room but because of Netflix it makes everything easier. Watching movies like The One on my old TV made it feel like a movie because of the...unrealistic picture quality.

With our basic, low cost Netflix plan, which allows two hours per month of streaming plus two DVDs, discovered that Netflix prevents streaming to the TV under this plan.Sound quality is satisfactory for us, picture quality seems very good, size is plenty big enough for our situation.  The time lag when changing channels is somewhat annoying.  We have not used some of the features on the remote.  We use an outdoor antenna (no cable) and receive the few stations we get at least as well as with the old set.Overall pleased with the TV after only a few weeks.

I decided to buy this TV because it was only a few bucks more than the unit I was look at, the screen was bigger, and it sounded like a cool idea.  I left it in the box for a few weeks, waiting until I had time to \"play with it\" because I was convinced it would be difficult for someone like me to set up and use.  When I finally got around to it, the TV was not difficult to set up at all.  I just love the features on this unit.  I subscribe to Netflix and have bought some videos on Amazon.  It is really great to just push a couple of buttons and watch anything I want at anytime without a disc or bothering with any other device.  The wifi works great and I love having so much to choose from without paying anything extra.  I have several tv programs and movies that I chose and saved to my \"Instant View Que\".  Of course you can also purchase movies or shows you are interested in which are not in the instant viewing catalog.  When I have time to relax, I just access Netflix or Amazon, pick what I want to watch from my \"Instant Que\" and push play.  I can see the day ahead where I/we will no longer pay for cable or satallite for TV programing.  The hardest part will be chosing which service(s) via internet to subscribe to.  I am a bit upset that I already have nice TV sets in my home.  I will be staying on top of this technology and will not hesitate to buy another internet ready TV the first time I have an excuse to.

Only a few days before, I had bought a Sony TV with Google TV. Don't get me wrong, that was also an excellent TV, but there was a lag between my xbox and the Sony TV. I ended up sending the Sony back after having no luck resolving the issue and Sony basically telling me that they knew it was a problem and they weren't planning to fix it. This Vizio was the second option, and I'm glad I ended up with it.This Vizio TV, while not the largest set out there, is plenty large enough for my needs as a game-playing college student who enjoys having friends over to play movies or watch the big game. The viewing angle is phenomenal, and the LED backlit screen is practically glare free when viewing mid-to-bright scenes. Before this set (and the Sony), I owned a cheap-o Sceptre 23\" set and I'm absolutely blown away by massive improvement. Potential buyers should keep in mind that your picture can only be as good as your source. I'm currently using basic cable on this TV and the picture is just awful, but that's because the cable picture is set up for old-style CRT televisions. Our plan gets the digital stations of our local over-the-air stations, and they are absolutely gorgeous.The sound in this television can be an issue for some folks. Thin TVs rarely have good speakers, but this vizio has a decent set that provides a range of sound. I prefer to have a cinematic experience with my games and movies, so I have a surround sound set-up and have the speakers turned off, but on occasion I've turned the speakers back on and used my sound system for something else and the TV's speakers do the job just fine.The internet connection and apps on this television are about as I'd expect. I connected via my home wireless in about 2 minutes and haven't had a problem since. I don't use a lot of the internet applications, but the ones I do use, I use quite a bit. (Pandora, Netflix, TuneIn Radio, and TV guide)As far as gaming goes, this TV is a winner. I plugged my xbox in via HDMI and turned on the game mode. The picture seems identical to when game mode is off and reactions are practically instant.I also have my TV set up next to my computer desk and as such is set up with my laptop as a second monitor. That is a great set-up too.This TV is the best TV I've ever owned and would recommend it to anyone looking for a TV for personal or small-group use.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "VIZIO XVT373SV 37-Inch Full HD 1080P LED LCD HDTV", "Author": "Big Reader \"Lynn Las Vegas\"", "ReviewID": "R3SU817F1Y5PAX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Vizio TV with only okay expectations but wanted the 37 inch TV, and was wowed when I saw the picture. The picture is crisp and clear and the color is terrific. I did need to do a little tweaking to get it perfect. Everything worked perfect right out of the box. It is very easy to set up. I needed two HDMI cables, one from the TV to the blue ray and one to the DVR cable box. I set the TV to regular sound as I do not like the echo from surround sound with talking shows, but it is easy to set up a surround theater system. The sound from the blue ray is stunning. The remote is really a neat thing, as it has a slide out keyboard which makes it very easy to get online. It is set up for wireless, so there is no need of a dongle to get online. You can connect wireless or by cable. There is a very good selection of sites and you can set it up for your own preferences and for each person viewing the TV. If you do not want an icon, you can delete it or you can download more. It has the typical web sites, like Hulu plus, netflix,  twitter, etc. If you want to surf the web, use your laptop, as it will not do this.This is a great size TV if you are not into the really big ones, and would like a decent sized screen.One thing to note, it is 1080i and not 1080p which I was disappointed in at first, but it made no difference in the quality of the picture. If your cable company does not have 1080i (very few do), you will have 720p.I had a HD TV, but this one is so clear, I was astonished how it makes the actors seem like they are in your living room. The other thing I noticed, there is some really bad acting which I never noticed before. Something I will have to get used to. Also make sure your cable is set to HDMI. I had an issue as the TV was set to HDMI, but not the cable. You will find it in settings on the cable remote.The speakers are okay, good for talking shows, but you need more for the big action movies or anything with music.I have not had any edges, or light show through, the picture fills the screen with no dead pixels, and is beautiful.All in all I am very happy with this TV and would recommend it highly. I did get the extended 4 year warranty from Vizio, which any TV over 30\" they will come to your home to fix. This gives me a total of a 5 year warranty, as they start the warranty after the year warranty expires. You can pay it in 3 payments or all at once whichever is easier for you.

So if the Netflix hangs up, you have no recourse.  Since these apps do not have automatic updates (like an ipod or a computer) you're stuck with their poor first version software.  I'm not sure how a manufacturing can make a product and not provide any guarantee to its functionality but Vizio apparently can.  (For this reason alone, I would not ever purchase another Vizio.)#2: The built-in wireless card fails to find its signal at least once per day.  I've utilized two different wireless routers with two different service providers and it does the same on both.  All my other wireless devices have no issues, so I'd consider this wireless card a \"Fail.\"#3: However you slice it, LCD tvs still fail in comparison to Plasma tvs (blurring, no true black, less color contrast, etc).  I have come to the sad conclusion that LCDs are simply the \"poor man's plasma\".  I own two Plasmas (one a Vizio and one a Panasonic which is the best brand by far) and you can really tell the video quality difference, so if picture quality is a major consideration...forget ANY LCD tv (and especially this one).

I ended up turning the smooth motion down on my input with cable and completely off on my blue ray input, and the problem is pretty much fixed. I know people that like the smooth motion effect though, so to each their own. Since you can adjust it this isn't any reason to downgrade the tv IMO.

I was looking for something that had a sleek design, good picture quality, versatility, and good price. About a year ago, I bought a Samsung LED tv that had all the above features but it also came with a hefty price tag. I wasn't looking to spend more than a thousand bucks for this new one. After reading all the reviews for this vizio tv, I decided to give it a try. The picture quality is pretty good. The only fault I see so far is blurred motion with the picture quality, especially when there's rapid movement with darker frames. It doesn't happen too often but it can be annoying. The speakers that came with this tv is okay. Just hook it up to your sound system for a more theatrical effect. Now, the internet applications for this tv surprised me. The setup took me about 5 minutes to connect wirelessly to my router. I stream movies through to this tv via Netflix. Picture quality is pretty good, depending how fast your internet connection speed is. FYI, I had to switch my AT&T; dsl service to 6 mb/sec download speed to get HD quality streaming from Netflix. There are other apps including facebook and twitter. I use this tv to show movies daily to people in my reception area. I get good feedback from them. Some have asked where I purchased the tv because they wanted to do the same setup at home. I'm really happy with purchase so far. It's not a Samsung in terms of picture quality but the internet apps that this vizio tv has makes it far more versatile than my Samsung tv.

Then when powering-up, it often showed a screen of colored squares, stayed like that for about 60 seconds, powered itself off, powered itself on, ran its boot sequence (blinking Vizio light) for about 90 seconds, then came up with a normal picture. Vizio tech support suggested re-initializing the TV, disabling Internet connection, and nothing improved the situation. Occasionally, the TV did power-up normally, but about 75% of the time, it performed as above. Since the TV was out of warranty, Vizio suggested a couple of TV repair services. I called one who estimated $200 to fix the TV. I gave the TV away and bought a Samsung.

I have started learning to accept that I will randomly see a TV reboot between once a day and twice a day, with the long stretch at twice a week.  I bought this TV after seeing people warning about this, but I assumed that Vizio would fix this problem with an update.  So far I've seen one update and 0 (zero) fixes for the random reboot.  I've been a Samsung owner for years and decided that I'd try another brand.  Wow what a mistake.  I've held back on my review hoping for a firmware update that fixes it, but I've been disappointed.  I will say if you are considering buying this TV, buyer beware.  You will have a really hard time watching this TV for more than 6ish hours without it deciding to take a short nap.  I'm going to start shopping for a Samsung replacement because I know it won't do this crap, even at a higher price.  I can only hope that Santa is cheerful enough to kick Amazon into refunding me fully for this TV.  It would be ho-ho-riffic if I had a credit to spend on a replacement TV.(update 8/8/12) Ok there was a firmware update which made off to on time go to nearly 3 minutes, which makes it slower to turn on than my grandfather's tube tv.  Bad news for me, my router died and thus I needed to re-pair my TV with a new wireless router.  Shazam!  The remote for this TV is dead and won't do anything ( I was using a logitech harmony remote for both it and the xbox 360 ).  The remote that came with it, which has been used maybe 10 times, is dead.  It won't work, it doesn't connect to the TV and I'm now unable to re-program the TV for the wireless internet.  I'm so pissed off with Vizio that I'll inform my friends to avoid it like the plague as I should have before I bought it.  From the reviews I've seen recently the remote is a light bulb, you will never know if it works until the next time you turn it on.

Vizio TV's are cheap, and they appear to give you the biggest bang for your buck, but they simply to no work as promised.  I purchased a Vizio XVT553SV which, at the time, was their flagship model.  Immediately, it had video artifacts/flickering on every input (Dish, PS3, media player).  Vizio's website even admits to this and promises that a firmware update and clean storage procedure would fix this!!! Vizio updated the firmware, and the issue appeared to be resolved for a few weeks, but then returned.  Vizio customer support had me do a power recycle, which resolved the issue for a few weeks, but, again the issues returned and new ones appeared - the video would freeze upon a cold start-up, the TV would turn off automatically in the middle of watching TV for no reason whatsoever. Vizio technical support had me do clean storage procedure which appeared to resolve the issue for a few days, but then the issues again returned.  Technical support  also admitted that the issue of the TV turning off intermittently will still be an issue until Vizio updates the firmware and they are looking into this issue now.  Through these issues, we could still watch TV - the issues were merely a nagging nuisance.  Finally fed up and fearful that the TV would fail once out of the warranty period, I called Vizio and they sent out a Technician to replace the logic board.  Within an hour after the technician left, the TV failed altogether.  Vizio now wants to replace my new TV that was defective upon arrival with a recertified TV which I objected to.  In order to get a new TV, they want me to pay an extra $300.00 plus tax!  I asked \"Ashley\" of Vizio customer support how she would feel paying good money for a \"new\" TV, but instead, getting a recertified TV.  She said she would be upset but this is their corporate policy.  So, buy a Vizio at your own risk - because it is very risky to do so.
