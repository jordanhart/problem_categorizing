Seems like a great value!", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Man Cave Approved", "Author": "drp103", "ReviewID": "RZRGZM9CL6QZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had some credit card points to burn, so I got a gift card and used it to buy a NEXUS 7 2nd GEN tablet and this HDTV - not from here but from K-Mart online.I have this little gem set up out in my man cave. For now, all I have hooked up to it is an DTV ANTENNA, pulling in local HDTV channels like CBS, etc. Now, I can watch a little NFL on Sundays with the sound off while listening to some tunes on the HIFI.It's a really basic HDTV with the bare minimum of picture adjustments, and has only 720P resolution. But, don't let these two things stop you from buying it; the picture looks great (after a few adjustments), and besides, you really don't need any more resolution for such a small size screen. The HD channels look fantastic; CBS broadcasts at 1080i and the football games look great - I didn't notice any blurring or pixel blocking during the fast action scenes. I'm a happy camper.Connectivity, too, is pretty basic. There are a couple HDMI inputs, older component and composite, and I believe a pair of stereo RCA audio inputs. There's a headphone jack that doubles as an analog audio output, so you can run audio to an analog amp or, of course, plug a pair of headphones into it. And finally, there is one digital coax output, so you can run audio to a digital amp. It does not have optical output.As a bonus, there is a USB media input. I honestly have not tried it yet, so I don't know what it is capable of playing - audio, video, pictures or otherwise. UPDATE: I plugged in a thumb drive with four different files on it: a JPEG Picture, M4A and MP3 Audio tracks, a short smartphone video, and an MKV file of a Twilight Zone episode. It played the MP3 audio song and showed the JPEG picture. There is no support for M4A audio (APPLE LOSSLESS) or MKV movies/TV shows. In fact I don't think this TV can even play any videos of any kind, even the ones that you can capture on your smartphone. So basically, it only plays MP3 audio tracks and you can view JPEG pics, that's it, and that's not too bad, considering the price. The interface and the player are really basic, but both worked just fine.The TV stand is a bit chintzy: a glass base and two other plastic parts. The whole thing is poorly designed and built. It took about 10 minutes to screw the parts together and to the TV itself, but thankfully, it's pretty solid, though I had my doubts. Of course, you can ditch it for a wall mount, as the TV has four threaded holes on the back for just that purpose.11/19/2013 - There're no networking options for this TV, either WIFI or ETHERNET. In other words, it's not a smart TV sporting things like NETFLIX streaming or support for DLNA. For the price, I wouldn't expect it. But, guess what? You could turn this dummy into a brain by buying a 35 dollar CHROMECAST. Afterall, it does have USB, which the CHROMECAST needs for power. In this regard, college students I'm looking at you, this is the perfect TV for young tech savvy people who are looking for a cheap HDTV and own ANDROID phones. Or, it could also double as a second computer monitor.All in all, It's a great looking HDTV at a wonderful price.

I don't understand why it takes a full 8 seconds after you turn on the thing for sound and picture to show up; that's just annoying.  I also dislike that there are zero buttons on the device itself so if you lose the remote, you're screwed.  Also, on some channels / programs, the picture is muddy and fuzzy. Fiddling with the <aspect> button allows me to change the size of the picture onscreen, but it's pretty much almost totally ineffective in terms of sharpening the picture.Nevertheless, for the price paid, I think this is a reasonable purchase.

However this TV has been gutted with minimum external components.  It only has 2 HDMI connections and 1 of those is dual purpose HDMI/DVI.  Only 1 either used as Component or AVI connection.  A digital audio output (something I haven't yet investigated how is used) and 1 headphone jack & 1 USB port.  That is it.  Several years ago I bought 2 26\" RCA's and it came loaded with 4 HDMI, VGA, 1 component, 1 AVI, USB, 1 audio in, and 2 audio outputs.VGA isn't required for those who did not know that.  On my 26\" I had been using a HDMI port for my computer.  In fact I used the VGA & HDMI ports and had instant dual monitors.  I did want one of these 32\"'s for my home office/sitting area but instead I bought a $59 RCA sound bar and plug it into one of the audio outputs on the 26\".  I'm thinking a special headphone adapter that splits into a A/V connector might also work to use a sound bar with but I haven't tried that.On the plus side this 32\" specs indicate it comes with 2 8Watt speakers.  Where most t.v.s now come with 2 4Watt speakers. I have twin 3 1/2 year old sons and noise is a constant at my home so a sound bar fixed that on my 26\".Instead, now, I'm keeping the 2 - 26\" t.v.'s for my home office since that is where I need all of the different connections and I bought 3 of these 32\" RCA's for the rest of the house. The outside antenna's picks up over 60 stations on this 32\" t.v. that was my only concern.  However I wasn't really concerned because I already had RCA's and knew they did a great job picking up air stations.Hope this is helpful.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally upgraded!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RZTJFF5TP0T7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally got past my old tube TV.

The TV itself is very nice to look at when it was turned off. And has a very heavy glass/metal stand. But who cares what a TV looks like when it's off? When I turned it on, the display was very crisp, but I immediately noticed a royal blue, stuck pixel in the left center of the screen, about an inch long. Then, I really started to examine the screen, by tuning to a channel that was mostly black, and I noticed another stuck pixel (also blue) about a half-inch long in the right-center of the screen about halfway up. I turned the TV off and back on. Still there.For a split second, I considered not sending it back (because you know what a hassle that can be), so I stood back from the TV about 10 feet away and still noticed both of them every time the screen was dark in those areas. I decided it would eventually drive me mad, so I'm in the process of returning it. I bought a COBY 32 inch (brand new this time), so we'll see how that compares. I bet if you bought this thing new and it actually worked, it would be well worth it.
