You don't get ANY past seasons and only every other episode for the current season, with a limit of 3 total. So you'll have episodes 1,3, & 5 and won't be able to see 2,4 & 6 to see what actually happened in between.

After installing the app, entering my Comcast ID and password, and declining to use the parental controls, it was ready to go. Basically, the new app does what the old Xfinity player did, with one big new feature that many people have been begging Xfinity for: It streams live TV. For now at least, the live shows are mostly news and sports channels, but hopefully that's just a start. The live channels include Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, BBC World News, and several other news channels. Sports Channels include ESPN (it's actually just a link to the Watch ESPN app), Fox Sports, Golf Channel, and a few others. The National Geographic and National Geographic Wild channels are included. Note that the audio volume can only be controlled from your tablet, and there's an option to turn on closed captioning.Another very nice new feature is the ability to download some TV shows and movies onto your tablet and take them with you for offline viewing later. I haven't tried this yet, and it's not entirely clear to me how to find eligible shows, although there is a help screen.Overall, the app is a big improvement over the earlier Xfinity app that it replaces. Hopefully Xfinity will add more live channels, but for now, having a good selection of news and sports is a very promising beginning.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Program does not work.", "Author": "James V.

We quit our Comcast cable but still have phone & internet at home, internet at a second residence & pay a portion of my parents Triple Play account. Since we share our Amazon Prime, Netflix, & Hulu+ accounts with my parents via a Roku player (and pay a portion of their Comcast cable bill), we now have access to HBO, Showtime & all the other shows available via the Xfinity TV player app on our Kindle Fires (currently Hubby & I both have HDX versions).When we first used the App.starting 12/2012 (on a KF HD 7&#34; & 8.9&#34;) there was the &#34;too low volume issue&#34; which required headphones to hear content properly. Thankfully, after almost a year they FINALLY fixed that problem!More.recently, my app was working correctly on my new HDX for the first few weeks in Dec 2013 but then started lagging badly. I'm pretty tech savvy and (apparently) took many more steps than the 3 Kindle specialists & 1 App store specialist I spoke with said they'd have even thought to suggest. I've sent a note via &#34;report an issue&#34; below and the App Store specialist has logged the issue extensively and reported to the developer directly. The same exact show will play fine on Amazon Prime or Hulu but is slightly choppy & often buffers when played via the Xfinity app. It's not so bad that the audio & video are out of sync, but almost. It's as if you're watching stop-motion video... everyone is moving just a little slow and choppy. It's noticeable enough to be annoying. As mentioned, I've done major troubleshooting including uninstalling & reinstalling app, hard resets, resetting my Xfinity modem, my router and releasing/renewing my IP address and more. Speed tests using multiple random servers show my average download speeds between 43-50 Mbps. It's not my WiFi. (I prefer watching via Xfinity app where possible because if there are commercials they usually lump them into a large 3-4 min section vs Hulu who may have 30-120 seconds of commercials every 10 minutes.If you're having any issues please contact the developers via the &#34;report an issue&#34; button below and/or Amazon. The developers (Comcast) do not read these reviews. If nobody speaks up the developers don't know there are issues.Two other things that really need to be addressed/fixed:1) anytime I log out or am required to clear the data, clear the cache, force stop & uninstall/reinstall any other video app such as Netflix, Hulu, etc., When you log back in all your preferences & bookmarks, favorites, history is still there. Not so with the Xfinity app. Even if you SIM p lying log out & back in you must find, bookmark & reorder (put them in a particular order by un-bookmarking & re-bookmarking in order) your favorite shows all over again.2) I'm still noticing multiple shows that are not being updated with the latest episode even days or longer after its aired while they are added to Hulu sometimes just after midnight of the day they played on TV.A recent example is Grimm. The most recent episode aired on Jan. 19th and was available on Hulu+ in the early morning hours of Jan. 20th (just after midnight PST, 3am EST). It's now 11pm PST/2am EST Jan. 23rd and the episode is still not available on the Xfinity app.Hoping these issues will all be very soon addressed in an update!", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "horrible level service", "Author": "K.

If this feature was available this app would be much more useful.The other feature is actually having parental controls. Right now, the only option is to show (or not show) adult movies. I think a basic function would be to allow you to choose the ratings that you allow on a device. For example, I would like to limit the movies to G, and PG. There is a Family category, but I would have to instruct my kids to navigate to that specific section and not the others.

My old Comcast account is now maintained by others, even though I retain sole access right now, yet that account also gives me access to this. Unlike Crackle and even Hulu, I can watch movies without commercials. I'm watching them in full HD. I can rewind to the beginning, or slide to where I left off.  I'm also not sure what people mean about being unable to control the volume. I have no difficulty there. I can make it so faint I can barely hear it, or so loud that it hurts my ears (perhaps those people have burned their ears out by listening to their mp3's too loud their whole lives?). The stereo in my ear buds is awesome (I have the Monster Earth, Wind & Fire buds), and I can't wait to try it with my bluetooth speakers. In all, I have no serious complaints. In fact, even through I've had my Fire HD 8.0\" practically from its introduction to the market, this is the first time I've reviewed an app... both because it is worthy of a review, and also because it is unworthy of the negative reviews it's received.  Again, Free doesn't get much better than this, and the apps that one actually has to pay for often have lousy audio fidelity, commercials, and streaming that can't maintain the video in HD.
