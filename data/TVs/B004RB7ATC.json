{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Know your needs, then you'll know what to buy", "Author": "Sui Lin Chee \"Sui Lin Chee\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q9W4YZOXE3MY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "People, I looked at this because it's a $13 item, but you have to understand what you need and the mount's upper limits so it won't disappoint you and waste your time.The mount description says max. VESA 300 x 260.  This generally means a HDTV up to about 40\" (200 x 200).  I checked several 39\"-40\" HDTV's and they use 200 x 200. (My situation is a 32\" back-lit LED LCD @ 10 lbs, very light).The width of the mount is about 13\" (337mm) so it won't span 2 studs (@ 16\" center), but most NEW (2012 models) are in the 20-30lb range (CCFL's are at the higher weight spectrum while back-lit 40\" can weight as little as 20lb w/o stand).  As such, you can use 4 drywall plastic anchors (which were provided with my unit).  For concrete or cement walls, I would suggest lead anchors which were NOT provided.If you are able to position the mount over 1 stud (2 screws), and 2 other screws in drywall or plasterboard, and the HDTV is less than say 35 lbs, I think you would be safe for the long run.Since I don't have a 42\" TV, I don't know if those sets transition to 400 x 400 (one Walmart Sanyo 42\" @ 33lb needs 400 x 400) so I would say the mount manufacturer is being too liberal in describing it suitable for 42\" and up to 88lbs.Bottom line, this is cheap & good mount for up to 40\" (200 x 200) and up to 30 lbs (my guess, if no stud); ove 30 lbs, I would look for 1 stud before buying this mount.  If you meet this, $13 and you're good to go.  If 42\" or more, or rated at 400 x 400, step up to the $25 mounts (look for free shipping) from other Amazon \"basic mount\" sellers -- the non-adjustable mounts are about 30mm from the wall, and the adjustable tilts are further out to provide needed clearance.The steel is of the right heft gauge for the newer, lighter weight TV's, and the mounting screws seem complete.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "For 10 bucks it does the trick.", "Author": "S. Whitaker \"superman1979\"", "ReviewID": "RS7Z69SVN91PU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Most the people reviewing this mount didnt do their research.  Not all tv's have the same vesa pattern.  It would hold the weight of a 42 inch tv as long as the vesa pattern on the tv is within the specs of the mount.  It also mention its length, so those complaining it wont reach your studs should have read the product description.  I bought it for a 32\" in sceptre tv I wanted wall mounted in my work out room.  The sceptre ways about 25lbs,  I mounted it to 1 stud with two lag bolts and 4 heavy duty dry wall anchors that are rated to 265lbs each.  This mount inst going anywhere.  Also the bubble level on mine was actually accurate. It comes with some various hardware to mount the tv.  I didnt use any though.  Went to the hardware store and got some stronger hardware for about 2 bucks.  also since the mount is so small it doesnt block any ports my 32 inch sceptre.  The only negative i have is that one of the arms \"prongs?\"  that hang on the mount, was a little bent. I bent it back.

While they are heavy-duty, and should easily keep the lightweight LED TVs on the wall for many years, I only wish they were wider.  The \"perfect\" mounting point is never exactly between two studs, and unless you are wanting to rip up a wall to put in braces, you MUST use the plastic anchors to mount to the dry-wall only.  Mounting this way, I'm sure you won't be able to hang a heavy TV, and if you rent, you'll not get any love from your landlord for having to drill four huge holes into the wall... a little wall-mud won't fix these holes!My second gripe is that even though the VESA mounting of these TVs was 200x200, there is not a lot of \"wiggle-room\" left/right for centering onto the wall, so make sure you hang the base-plate as close to perfect as you can... you'll only have a couple inches of adjustment on the mount.  If you're using this to hang a 320x200 VESA, you'll have to be perfect in positioning of the mount, because you'll have zero room for adjustment.On the bright-side, the \"level\" on mine was actually more accurate than some I've hung in the past (with level on the outer edges).

The unit was purchased to wall mount in a small quest bedroom a 23\" LCD TV with 100mmX100mm mounting sockets. The smallest screws supplied were a bit too long, so I used 3 (each screw) - 1/8X9/16 fender washers as spacers and they worked perfectly. The bracket is mounted on 3/4\" cherry tongue and groove paneling, so I went with four #10X3/4\" Phillips pan head sheet metal screws with 1/8X9/16 Fender washers. This mount is solid as a rock and way overkill for this puny TV. I used my better grade level and found the one attached to the mount to be quite accurate. The entire unit is completely invisible behind the TV...and would be so down to a 20\" with no problems.For those mounting to sheetrock (drywall) and have concerns about the unit staying put, I suggest using standard hollow wall anchors if a stud isn't available. They will easily support the max weight of this TV mount, rest assured. Drill your holes, insert the expansion unit and then use a Fender washer for the screw. The extra diameter washer size will better span the mounting bracket slots and provide a snug fit on the screw as well.
