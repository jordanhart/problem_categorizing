A side by sidecomparison made it clear that i had made the right decision. The LG'spicture quality is superior in almost every way.Pro's------There aren't many quality 26\" tv's out there and the 26LV2500 is one ofthe better ones i've seen so far.-The picture is vibrant and sharp and comparable to some mid-range32\" non led-backlit lcd's i looked at in store. Response time looksgood to my eyes.-Most 26\" tv's include 2 hdmi ports, the LG has 3.-The LG is attractive with its glass-like bezel.Thin and bright, thanks tothe LED backlight.-The Intelligent Sensor works rather well and is surprisinglyuseful.-Menu system very well laid out with useful functionality.Con's------Off angle viewing is pretty bad. Colors wash out slightly when i stand upand noticeably when moving to the sides of the screen. My old Sharp LCD wasactually a lot better in this regard.-The Sharp used a matte screen, the LG has a glossy screen and in a brightroom the image is mirror-like, particularly in dark scenes. Very annoying.-Audio quality is as bad as expected and comparable to other TV's thissmall and thin. Turning the bass all the way up and the treble nearly allthe way down makes things bearable.-Black levels and screen uniformity is as expected for a tv in this rangewith some backlight bleeding in the edges. This of course is onlynoticeable in a black screen with the backlight set to max and will notmatter under normal usage conditions.Bottom line-----------The 26LV2500 is a feature packed and thoughtfully designed LED back-lit TV.If you're in the market for a 26\" TV, you can't go wrong with the LG andyou will not be disappointed as long as you take it's limitations intoconsideration.However, if you have space for a larger 32\" TV, there is a wider selectionworth looking at here. With the LG, you are paying more for the LEDbacklight and thinner bezel rather than picture quality. At around $350,you can easily get a 32\" 720p NON-LED LCD that is either as good or betterthan the LG.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice small TV", "Author": "KJHarris", "ReviewID": "RWT24X4N5M6JC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a small LCD TV for our guest bedroom and decided on the LG 26LV2500.  This seemed to offer the most features at the lowest price for the use it would get--only when we had guests in our spare bedroom.  The set arrived very promptly in the mfg. original packaging and there was no damage to the carton and everything was there.  It was easy to assemble and set up.  Since I was using a basic cable connection(no box) I needed only the coax connection.  The set scanned for and found all my cable provider's digital channels, both HD and SD(There are no more analog transmisions in my area). The picture is bright and clear(at least when viewed from bed) and although \"only\" 720p it looks as good(to me)as the two large 1080p sets that I already have.  The sound is certainly fine for the use it will get. All the settings are easy to access and adjust and there are many more inputs than I will need on this set.  I did resurrect an very old(non blueray) DVD player and connected it using the composite input--it produced a nice picture with standard DVD's.  The only thing I found a bit strange was the power brick. Instead of the set getting power directly from from a 120V outlet, you plug a power brick into the outlet, which has a cord that plugs into the TV.  I assume this is used because it is cheaper and/or easier that trying to design a 120V to 24V power supply that will fit into this very thin TV.  So overall I am pleased.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "absolutely stunning picture.", "Author": "Anthony", "ReviewID": "ROJM0LVH35E85", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am, by no means a huge HD fanatic, and I don't get anal about black levels or minor flaws (really how could you at this price;) but I know when something is pleasing to my eyes and this TV is it, to say the least. Playing the PS3 or watching Breaking Bad is an experience words cannot describe, but I'll give it a shot. black levels are deep, colors are vivid (really vivid,) you can have it as bright ass you want without the strain on your eyes, and all for less than $400. Sound quality from the unit is extremely poor I have to admit (staticy bass just one example,)  but the tv is as thick as a penny (not a figure of speech.) just get some computer speakers with a sub-woofer, you'll be fine. I have only used the HDMI and USB ports so I can't touch on RCA input quality. no real complaints except for an somewhat noticeable dead pixel or something in the top right hand corner of the screen ( It is only noticed on a pure white screen, I could care less.)", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG 26V2500 - a very good TV at a great price", "Author": "Paul M. Whitacre", "ReviewID": "R1HQUHJ98SULD3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a few days of research, I purchased the LG 26V2500 for my home office to replace a TV system cobbled together to make due over the last few years.  I got my money's worth from the Hauppauge WinTV 950Q  tuner and had been using an old 17\" LCD monitor for the TV display with a travel speaker bar for audio, all attached to my 64-bit Dell computer on Windows 7.  It worked good enough but was a hog on processing speed even with a quad core processor.I also considered the Samsung LN26D450, another highly rated LCD TV.  However, the LG had two features not offered on Samsung's TV - a coaxial input connection with an integrated ATSC/NTSC/Clear QAM digital tuner (in addition to an analog NTSC tuner).  This will allow me to receive over air DTV signals now and perhaps use the TV for digital cable sometime in the future, should the occasion arise.  The LG has backlighting LED not found in the Samsung, which I do like ( I have a larger Samsung that also has backlighting).  Both TVs were 720p resolution - 1080p isn't worth the extra cost at this screen size. The cnet.com site doesn't recommend LED as a desirable feature but I do like it.  As the LG had a lower price, it sealed the deal for me.Ordering was quick and the shipment arrived three days later with no issues.  I was surprised the TV was shipped in only its original retail packaging.  Some tape was showing the wear and tear from shipment with some separation from the box packaging.  I'd recommend Amazon reinforce the tape if this is a standard practice.  Nothing was broken or missing - no harm, no foul.  Assembly was quick - four small screws were provided to install the two-piece base to the TV body and then it was ready for hookup.I connected two HDMI cables - one for the satellite TV feed and a second for the computer - and the indoor on-air antenna.  The power is provided via a transformer adapter with a small connector in the back of the TV.  Upon powering up, a few steps brought one to the auto-detection of what is connected and then the discovery of available on-air channels.  The process was relatively quick, with the TV detecting several channels the Hauppauge tuner never found.  After using the manual channel setup, I deleted a number of channels I didn't want.I then walked through the menu to see what else was necessary.  I used the \"Picture Wizard\" to set up the contrast, brightness, and backlighting using some recommended on-screen guidelines, which did help identify settings I might not have otherwise considered.  I like the backlighting An energy saver feature allows the TV to reduce power consumption by lowering the backlighting levels - this I left off, using the automatically saved \"Picture Wizard\" settings I just input.  The ambient lighting sensor works well for changing room lighting conditions, so I don't have to fiddle with the display for daytime versus evening viewing.The audio settings were next.  I know many people in this forum complain about the audio quality from the small speakers (the price one pays for a thin LED TV) but I found the speakers more than adequate with no tinny or overly thin sound.  I've cranked the volume from 0 to 100 and noticed no significant distortion and plenty of volume. I don't listen to my music on the TV; I have a stereo system for that.  I'm no strict audiophile but I have no issue with the sound quality from any source so far.  The audio does have a feature called \"Clear Voice II\" that enhances speaking voices over background noise - this works well.  When they arrive, I'll hook up my small surround speakers to the TV - that will improve what is already an acceptable issue for me.I tested the display and audio from the PC and all works well.  The 1380x768 resolution is not as detailed as my other monitors but it is sufficient and the screen is larger, so having this option for streaming video and movies will be great.  Satellite and on-air DTV audio and video worked well and without issue.  The displays are clear without any discernible blurring in sports broadcasts.The remote is intuitive and doesn't have too many buttons to cause confusion.  The printed manual provides no information on the Simplink button - but a quick check on the Internet confirmed that this is for other LG components that can be interconnected to the TV.  As I have none, I leave this off in the menu selection. This omission is not a deal breaker but LG seems to have missed an opportunity to explain it and promote it in their literature.The bottom line is that, overall, I'm very happy thus far with the purchase and don't see anything that I would like modified.  I'll update this review later if the situation warrants as it is based on only a few days of use but, so far, life is indeed good with this LG product.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best small LED TV for sound and picture", "Author": "V.

The picture is excellent.  Great viewing angles for an LED, and the response time is far better than my Vizio.  Something not yet mentioned in the other reviews is the quality of the user interface.  In my opinion, LG has a leg up on its competitors in this particular area.  The menus are very well designed and user-friendly.  In design sense, they are the Apple of the TV industry.  The only issue I had with this set was the product info for the type of VESA mount it requires.  The Amazon product info didn't include this and the product website had the wrong information.  For those who need to know, the VESA mounting size is 100 x 100.  Please note that a universal mount, or any with a mounting plate larger than this size, will not fit this TV.

The deal breaker for me was the horrible tin like sound from the Samsung, disapointing since the picture quality is good. The LG has a much better sound and more outputs.

I can't find a problem viewing at different angles, no difference I can see 30 degrees either side of center and that's beyond normal in our house. You can actually see the picture, the colors and brightness at much larger angles, but the image is foreshortened as you'd expect.  LCD's have a much more severe problem and have compensation to deal especially with different vertical viewing angles.  Second issue is sound.  This LG replaced a Toshiba LCD that had serious sound quality and volume problems.  The sound is clear, \"normal\" and the volume range is more than adequate.  If you want to plug in your Bose speakers there are ports.The family here was happy enough with this 32\" model that we bought a larger LG for another room.My only odd observation is that both LG's required two tries at automatic programming the channels to get them all.  There isn't much a user can do wrong and on the second pass they were all correct and no channels captured that were not there.  I have brand X in my office and it requires manual editing to delete about 30 false channels that it picks up in the automatic programming.

I use the digital converter (cable tv doesn't offer much of what I want and the 4 or 5 free stations I get include local channels and PBS programs I like).  Since the advent of digital tv, I have lost more and more 'free access' channels, so I seriously considered going without a tv altogether. Scuttlebutt is sometime in 2012 there will be no more viable free access tv programming.  I figured I would have a nice new tv on which to watch videos, if that is true.Why I chose LG: I travel for business and have seen a marked difference in picture quality in the LG tvs provided in some hotels.  This unit didt disappoint.  My living room is rather dark, and I especially appreciate the choices in brihtness and energy consumption.  The menu is fairly intuitive and easy to use.  The oddest glitch is the 'stand.'  Its parts are cheap plastic, which crumbled when I tried to put them together.  So the screen is propped up against my TV cart on the floor.  Too bad this technically terrific TV is so cheesy in the physical setup.  I had to laugh when I looked this up to recommend to a friend, though.  Amazon promises it will ship in 1-2 months for $319?

Picture is initially bright and clear, but rapidly dims and no setting tried maintains the brightness and clarity.  The call to LG proved to be a bad experience.  The rep kept putting me through the same steps (having to do with energy saving and pressing 2 keys on the remote).  Each time I did as instructed, the screen was almost immediately turned off and the rep would not listen to what I was trying to tell him.  If the main problem is due to the energy saver feature (as the rep kept insisting), there are other problems as well.  Ultimately, the rep became argumentative and told me I'd just have to keep pressing the buttons until I got it right (there were 2 keys to press).  I grew annoyed with his talking to me like I was dimwitted and told him I did not want to continue the conversation. He just got louder and I had to get rude with him and turned my phone off...he immediately called me back and I told him not to call me again...he called again and I told him if he continued calling me, I would lodge a complaint against him...this ended the calls.I have another LG TV (the 32\") and love it, which is why I bought the 22\" for my computer room.  Right now, I will probably go back to my 15\" Sharp VERY OLD TV.There would be no negative feedback and I would simply exchange the TV but for the attitude of the customer rep.

I bought the Samsung 22\" inch 5003 after reading a lot of reviews but the colors it produced were intolerable so I need to return it. The LG has almost everything I want, decent sound, good picture and reliable color. But compared the samsung 5000/5003 and my former samsung ln19a65o there is a TON of picture noise on this TV. Ugh. And from what i've read this is because it's native resolution is 768x1366 and so it needs to be scaled and as a result the pixels don't match your tv's pixels exactly. Okay, that sounds a lot worse than it actually is, but it's obvious when looking at the tv. After going from my original samsung, and then the samsung 5003 it is so evident and almost unbearable but if you are *NOT* coming from a samsung or other non-scaling HD tv you may not notice it and it may even look good to you. If you're replacing a samsung, i'd be willing to bet the picture noise on this TV will bother you. it's actually bugging the HECK out of me, but i really haven't had any luck finding a TV without a drawback equal to it. Check the LG out in person if you can before purchasing.If you're not real fussy about realistic color, skip this and get one of the current flat panel sammy 22\" line up instead of the LG, but check both the Sammy and the LG side by side in Best Buy if you can and see which issue bothers you less.Other than that issue, this is a good tv. Other than the picture noise the images are clear. I fiddled with the sound settings a bit and the sound can be...okay, you're not going to find small lcd/led tvs that can produce sound much better than just okay.The blacks could be a little better, if you watch a fair amount of dark movies this might bother you. I use my TV mostly for a few prime time TV shows and occasional action moves so it's not too much of an issue although noticeable and slightly annoying.as for the little things, the different picture pre-sets are pretty good, and the built-in picture customization tool is pretty cool and helpful i guess, but i have the Disney WOW dvd for that. The Inteli-sensor setting is actually kinda good, automattically adjusting the picture to whatever lighting there is in the room at the time.The number and type of outputs are great, they have everything a person might need, 2 hdmi, audio out, pc links, etc, and I love the onscreen menu, i think it's great.So basically, everything about the TV is good, the picture noise is pretty much the only flaw, but i'll try to live it.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor Manual", "Author": "visionfounder", "ReviewID": "R24CBGBAZJCZ9W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ordered it Sunday and received it Wed., prompt shipping by Abt Electronics through Amazon.

Viewing angle isn't as good as some other sets but not a deal-breaker. Speakers are down-firing and get the job done, not particularly well but done nonetheless.

I received the order end of November 2011 and the unit was actually made in October 2011, so I was happy to not get something that had been sitting in a warehouse for 4-6 months.  Since it was a Christmas present it did stay in the box till Christmas Day 2011.  The television seemed to work flawlessly despite less than impressive HD quality and poor view from anywhere other than directly in front of the TV.  Then on January 20, 2012 the TV would not turn on.  I called for assistance and went through several steps with the LG tech support, trying different outlets, etc. nothing worked.  They said they would set up a service call with an authorized repair center and that a repairman would come by on Friday January 27, 2012.  Well nobody came to my house on Friday, nobody called with an explaination, so I called LG customer service back.  I am not sure what country LG customer service is located in but they were very hard to understand.  LG explained that I needed to call and set up the repair with the authorized repair facility, he gave me the name and number of the nearest repair center more than 40 miles away.  When I contact the authorized repair facility he tells me that LG had informed him of the warranty repair the week prior and that he had all of my information.  At this point I think that the problem is with the authorized repair center just not keeping the appointment so I asked, \"Well since you did'nt make it by on Friday, when will you be here to repair my TV?  The owner of the small electronics store informed me that he had contacted LG after receiving the repair notice to let them know that since LG does not pay for mileage or trip charges and that unless I could bring the TV in to his business I would have to wait until he had another call or two in my location so he could justify the 80-mile round trip.  So now I am making the 80-mile round trip on my dime and time, LG should have let me know that the repairman had called them back and informed them of this instead of me sitting around all day Friday waiting for someone who was never going to show up in the first place.  LG has proven that their customer service is inept, and that everything they make is of poor quality.  I will tell my friends I should have listened to them and that their experiences with LG appliances were a good indication of LG products in general.
