The tv arrived the next day with amazon prime free two day shipping. Just like everyone said the picture is excellent, and the 120hz refresh rate makes for an incredibly life like viewing experience. As for the sound I have noticed that the sound level does seem to fluctuate when changing channels, but this was easily fixed by turning off the truvolume feature. i have only had the tv for a week but there has been no problem with the sound matching up, i do have version so it may be that the tv doesn't work well with certain cable providers. The volume and power of the speakers in my opinion are great, far superior to other sets I've seen with hidden speakers in which the sound is always muffled.I am very pleased with my purchase, and at a price of only $450 and only $50 for a three year warranty i don't see how you can go wrong with this tv.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Incredible Picture, Awful Audio, But Workable Set", "Author": "Brent in NY", "ReviewID": "R32G3O2UKOL5Q5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading a ton of reviews on several sites, I hesitantly bought this on sale at BJ's for $399...the price was too good to pass up. First and foremost I want to clear up the \"lip sync\" issue, because that is a truly annoying thing to have to live with...you HAVE TO USE AN HDMI cable with this set ($32 Walmart - bought the Vizio brand - figured that made the most sense).  The regular audio/video cables that come in the box are pointless, Vizio can have them back. \"lip sync\" fixed.  After a few days of use, I noticed the volume fluctuations that have been described in reviews...I could live with them, but choose not to...so I bought Vizio's basic Sound Bar ($98 Walmart).  Got that home and again with the cables provided, I couldn't get the sound bar to work, so back to the store to buy an \"S/PDIF\" audio cable(This is what it said next to the input).  Not available at Walmart this time, so over to Radio Shack I went.  The guys there had no idea what I was talking about, but we did an internet search and found out it is simply an \"optical audio\" connection, they had one and I bought it ($25 Radio Shack).  Got the sound bar working, and the \"Volume Problem\" is fixed and it sounds great!  The sound bar utilizes the \"TruVolume\" and \"TruSurround\" features perfectly.  Now I just need a universal remote so I can control everything with one device.So my final thoughts are...with all the extras bought and in place, this set is a phenomenal value considering the price paid!  $399+35+98+25=$557.  Plus I threw in the 3 year warranty offered me for $40 (after all, I said bought it hesitantly).  So for everything under $600 and the proper/best video/audio hook-ups in place and complete with sound bar, I am very happy.  I knocked it down 1 star for Vizio being a pain in the ass and making me do all the \"runaround\", I am in Marketing, and if I worked for Vizio, I would put out a bundle edition with EVERYTHING in one box.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture but some usage problems", "Author": "J. Hahn \"windsurfer\"", "ReviewID": "R2O34570B2L2FD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this unit because I have a space in a cabinet that's less than 36\" wide and this is one of the few 37\" TVs that will fit.  There are some problems which I find annoying but some people may not notice or care about.  Sometimes there the audio and video are not in sync.  The audio leads the video by a fraction of a second.  It happens about 20% of the time.  Sometimes the set reboots itself, going black and then displaying the VISIO logo before restoring the picture.  This is very infrequent, but it does happen occasionally.  The response to the remote in some cases is slow.  For example, unmuting takes a significant fraction of a second.  There are other less bothersome issues too.  I called VISIO tech support and they said they weren't familiar with these problems and had me do a full reset which had no effect.  I exchanged the unit I bought for a second and it had the same problems.  Then I read a review by someone else complaining about the same problems (and others).  The set has great specs and the picture seems to be just fine and that's most important.  I would really prefer to replace this unit with another brand, but there are no reasonably priced 37\" sets on the market at this time that will fit.Update (1/18/11): I ended up getting the Samsung LN37C530 (one of the few others that fits in my cabinet).  I ended up spending about $600 for a TV that's only 60Hz and would not have done that if I didn't have to.  The Samsung has none of the sync or volume issues that the VISIO did with the exact same inputs.Some other observations: one gripe I had with the VISIO was slow tuning on broadcast signals.  The Samsung tunes much faster, but the VISIO was able to do a better job of locking on to weak signals.  I surf a lot, so prefer faster tuning.  I had to tweak the Samsung picture to get it to my liking and I don't think it's as good as the VISIO (not a refresh issue; I can't say I notice that).  One big advantage of the Samsung is that it creates a program guide from the broadcast signals that's very handy.  In sum, I could not live with the VISIO issues and am definitely happier with the Samsung despite its higher cost, lower specs, and its own quirks.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "VIZIO: Dishonest Employees, Dishonest Company", "Author": "Kira", "ReviewID": "RC9NMC0FU3XOX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the first bad review I have ever written, which just shows how disappointed and upset I am with VIZIO. And from my recent experience I will NEVER buy anything with the VIZIO brand name on it ever again.My husband and I bought a 37-inch, 1080p, 120 hz refresh rate VIZIO HDTV. About 8 months later it started having problems where the whole screen would flicker and lines would go across the top half of the screen, making it impossible to see anything we were trying to watch. So we called VIZIO and sent them pictures of the problem, and they sent out a guy to fix it. His repairs seemed to work at first, but then a couple months later the problem came back, and even worse than before. So we called VIZIO again.This time they said they were going to send us a replacement TV. Now, I knew it was important to my husband that the TV was a 37-inch 1080p with a 120 hz refresh rate just like the one we had, so I asked for the specifications of the refurbished TV they said we would be getting. The woman from VIZIO told me it was a 37-inch 1080p and 120hz refresh rate replacement TV, and I quote, \"It's exactly like the TV you have now except slightly better.\" So we accepted the model and had it sent out.When we received the new TV the very first thing I did after opening the package was check the manual for the specifications. I was shocked and upset to see that under refresh rate it said \"60 hz\", so of course I called Vizio that same day. The guy I talked to put me on a hold for a few minutes saying that he was going to talk to a manager to find out what happened. When he came back on the line he said the manager said I should have been sent an equal TV and that he was going to see what he could do about the problem. So the guy said he would give me a call back when he heard from the manager. I waited for several weeks with no call, so I called VIZIO again. A woman answered and she talked to the previous guy to find out why he hadn't called me. He said he was still waiting to hear from the manager, so I waited several more weeks. Finally I called again, this time demanding something be done and that I wasn't going to wait to be called anymore. The woman I was talking started giving me some garbage about how I had accepted the model and so there was nothing they could do, so I said, \"Yeah I accepted it because I was told it would be just as good if not better than our old TV!\" but she just kept repeating the same thing. So I asked to talk to a manager, and she got one for me. He kept saying the same things the woman did, completely ignoring the fact that I was telling him that two of his employees had outright lied to me. And then he had the nerve to say that since we'd been using the replacement TV they sent us for almost 2 months, he definitely couldn't do anything about it. I pointed out that I called right after we received the package and that the only reason we'd been using the replacement TV for so long was because I was waiting for that one employee to call me back since he said he had told me he would fix the problem. So the manager said, \"Well I'm not sure why he told you that because there's nothing we can do.\"Moral of the story: VIZIO TVs may seem great, but if they have any problems whatsoever (which it seems they often do from other reviews I've read), you can bet you'll either get nothing back (as I read happened to people in other reviews), or you'll get a TV of less value, and VIZIO will fix up your old one and sell it again, pocketing the extra money they just made from ripping you off. VIZIO doesn't care about their customers at all, and their warranty plans are only there to make unknowing shoppers feel secure in spending all of their savings on their products, since the plans are completely worthless otherwise.Congratulations on earning the title of the most dishonest company I've ever encountered, VIZIO.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vizio E371VA", "Author": "Jerome E Natoli", "ReviewID": "RBB8AAN8WX3D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This tv was not right for me.  The picture, with a high quality source, is phenomenal.  1080p and 120hz at this price is unheard of, and won me over.  However, great picture doesn't make up for the sets many problems.  The sound is loud enough, but sounds tinny and weak, and isn't synched with the video (strange since they're both going through the tv).  The inputs are a bit inconvenient to use, and all 4 hdmi inputs are on the same side, so if you have more than 1 source there it can get cramped quickly.  The biggest flaw for me, though, is the input lag from game consoles.  It takes nearly 1/2 a second for a button press to be shown on-screen, making most games unplayable (to me, I came from a CRT with no lag so I could be picky).  If videogames are not an issue and you can get around the lip-synching issue with a good sound system or something, then you will not be disappointed by the picture, and won't find more features on a 37 inch for this price.  If you plan on anything more than casual gaming (wii is pretty unplayable too, the remote feels off) than buy another tv with a quicker input response.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not sure what everyone is complaining about...oh wait...", "Author": "Ryan White \"Ryan\"", "ReviewID": "RN3U68IMCW74C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Vizio 37\" TV for a few days now, so I temper my positive review with the idea that the other shoe could drop...although with Amazon's return policy, I feel pretty confident.  I was a little apprehensive about the purchase because of the negative reviews, but I have not seen any of the reported problems from other reviews.** Video/Audio not in sync?  Not a problem here.  I've tried all the HDMI ports, component input, composite input.  No problems.  Input sources LG BluRay player, PS3, Wii, Time Warner Cable DVR.  No issues.  I'll revise my review if I find anything, but it looks good for now.  ***UPDATE***  Found it.  The coaxial input has a BIG SYNC PROBLEM. WOW. CRIMINALLY BAD.  The HDMIs however are still perfect even after a year of use.** Audio level fluctuating wildly from channel to channel?  Not exactly.  There is a TruVolume feature, which attempts to wrangle the variances from channel to channel.  Sometimes this takes a half second to kick in when you are changing channels, so it sounds weird if you are a channel flipper.  I will say, in particular, that this feature works well on The Bravo Channel, which in my opinion is the WORST offender when it comes to volume shift.  Their commercials are easily twice as loud as their programming.  The TruVolume does a good job of taking the edge off that nonsense.  Get it together Bravo.  The feature needs some work, but it is not totally without merit.** No dead pixels and I had mine shipped overnight via Amazon Prime.  Again, I was concerned about shipping damage, but the box was well constructed and in great shape when it arrived.  It seemed to have been handled gently enough.I will say that the audio is tremendously weak, but not because of the audio processor...it's because of the super-pathetic mini-bar of speakers along the bottom.  My girlfriend doesn't seem to mind the lack of mid and low frequency reproduction, but I'm an audio snob though and I have a low tolerance for such things.  The only audio output on the TV is an optical out, so make sure your home theater system has an optical input if you're planning on using external speakers.  Please, please, please plan on using external speakers.  Save yourself from bad sound.  Don't spend 4 bills on a TV and not another hundy on a basic 2.1 TV stereo setup.

Changed settings, saw the picture from different angles, distances and heck, even talked to a few Vizio owners (friends) about how their sets performed. Everything sounded good, and I finally bought it from Costco at $399+tax. The reason why i persisted with the research was i was looking for a sub $400 LCD TV and this TV had specs that were not matched by anyone in the 37 inch segment for this price. Disclaimer-I was researching mainstream LCD brands Samsung/Panasonic/LG/Sony/Toshiba/Sharp/Vizio and was not considering other brands.2 weeks of use later-here's my thoughts. The picture is AWESOME. Don't get me wrong-I am sure the 37 inch Samsung LED's have better picture, but they are $900. Also, I had upgraded from a 4 year old LCD-it blew the older set in terms of picture quality. I have HD programming and this TV has an awesome picture throughout-sports, movies & NatGeo/Discovery. However, do turn the Tru stuff off and make the effort to customize the picture based on your room settings. The response time is average-it takes a few seconds (around 5-6) to turn on and another sec for sound to come. Changing channels is fast (less than a second for the next channel to come) and i did not experience any of the sound lag issues that so many reviewers have complained about. The picture quality,sharpness & brightness are excellent. You can watch the TV from a wide viewing angle and there is no change in picture quality.The bad-sound is tinny, get a good set of speakers. But nearly all LCD TV's have this issue. And this TV has issues if you want to use it as a monitor. I tried a lot to set it up as a monitor but did not succeed-could be my fault here. But i did exactly what was written in the manual.However, given the money i paid for it-I am totally satisfied and would buy it again. If you have a thousand bucks for a LCD-skip this TV.

I primarily found it because of physical size (our TV cabinet has a 35.5\" width max and this is 35.4\"), but I am very happy with what I got for our money.  Here's the breakdown:VIDEO:  The picture quality is EXCELLENT on both HD and SD sources - no graininess like you see on most cheaper sets.  The default picture settings & processing options that are built-in aren't bad, but (as with most displays) if you have a quality source then you don't need most of that stuff.  I turned off all the \"extras\" like the ambient light sensor, motion smoothing and so on, because having those one turned on locks you out of adjusting the other settings yourself.  I then used the THX Optimizer (available from the main menu on most any THX-certified DVD like Star Wars or Pixar films) to adjust all the settings to proper values.  The result is a GREAT picture quality!  My sources are an AT&T; U-verse (Cisco) HD DVR (1080i) via Component Video cables and a Sony Bravia HTIB DVD player (1080p, built-in upconvert from DVD-standard 480p) via HDMI.  I had them hooked up the other way around, but after the first couple hours the TV decided that it couldn't properly interpret the HDMI signal from the U-verse set-top box.  (I don't know if this was an issue w/ the TV or the set-top box...)  As it turns out, that worked out better anyway b/c the HTIB allowed me to properly set the output aspect ratio & stuff like that with the HDMI where it wouldn't with the Component out.  I do not have an audio feed from the U-Verse box to the TV, but rather have an Optical audio cable running to the HTIB.  I'll discuss that next.AUDIO:  The sound quality from the built-in speakers is mediocre at best.  As with most of the other reviews I read, I found the sound quality to be hollow and tinny.  Increasing the bass &/or lowering the treble to try and offset this only made it sound muddy.  The TruSurround feature that's on by default is actually the best option for built-in sound.  I did turn the volume limiter feature off right away, as I haven't yet encountered a device that con properly manage the fluctuations in commercial vs. program volume.  As for the \"lip-syncing\" effect that several have mentioned, I did see this also.  However, as I channel-surfed a bit I found that it varied from channel to channel and even sometimes corrected itself if I went to a new channel and then back to the original one.  Again, I don't know if this is the TV or the set-top box.  I tried it with all the audio processing turned on, and with it all turned off, and got the same mixed results.  Because of the less-than-stellar experience with the audio as noted, I decided that the easiest thing to do was to route the sound through the HTIB and not use the built-in speakers.  This works out really well for the best overall experience anyway.  It is noteworthy that I do still get a bit of the \"lip-syncing\" audio effect from time to time, but it either catches back up on it's own or goes away as I change channels.  I think with a bit of time I'll stop actually looking for it and it will become less noticable.  We'll see.PACKAGING:  I found the manufacturer's packaging to be lean and efficient, but the fact that Amazon ships it right back out in the same packaging adds a high risk of damage.  The mfr's packaging on these TV's is designed for 2 types of handling: palletized shipping on a freight truck (where the box is not handled individually and is much better protected) and carrying from the store to your car and from your car to the house.  These boxes were not designed for shipping by small-package companies like UPS and FedEx.  Amazon should really consider over-boxing these types of products (as per both UPS and FedEx's recommended standards for electronics) to protect them better.  I would pay a few dollars more per item of this type to cover the expense...maybe it could be added as an option at checkout...SERVICE:  My order shipped very quickly, despite being placed in a holiday week (between Christmas & New Years) and traversed the UPS Ground system quickly.  When it was delivered to me, however, I found that it had been severely damaged.  The box had a BIG puncture area and the TV screen had a golf ball sized dent in it with spider-webbing over 1/3 of the screen surface.  This is where Amazon's reputation for customer service SHINED through.  I immediately went online and requested an RMA and got one issued right away with no problems.  I took the TV to my local UPS hub (not too far from home/office) and dropped it off.  The UPS employee there told me that they are not even supposed to accept TV's for shipment b/c they are so prone to damage.  Uh-oh...  Amazon then sent me a replacement TV for free via FedEx Standard Overnight.  It arrived as promised and in much better condition than the 1st unit.  I don't know if it's the difference between UPS and FedEx or the difference between Ground service and Air, or if it was just bad/good luck.  I can say, though, that I was very impressed with Amazon for the way they handled the situation with no questions asked.OVERALL:  A GREAT TV AT A GREAT PRICE!  When you order a bargain TV from a bargain brand and have it shipped in instead of buying it in-store, you expect to have an issue or two.

Martin", "ReviewID": "RCZMFKB7AGW6M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was our first Vizio television--and probably our last.  It's a shame because it has a fantastic picture that rivals televisions twice its price.  The issues we had echo some of the sentiments many reviewers on here have for this TV.The first night we used it, we noticed the volume level would increase and decrease wildly, many times within the same commercial or show.  This was way more noticeable than the usual show-to-commercial volume increase that we're all accustomed to.  This Vizio set was to replace our 42\" Samsung plasma which we moved to another room.  The Samsung did not share these audio issues.  Also, while watching a show, the audio on the Vizio cut out completely, and would only be restored if we changed the channel or restarted the TV.  This happened on three occasions so far in the week we owned it.  Turning off the SRS TruVolume feature did help, but fluctuations in volume were still noticeable.We also experienced the TV powering off by itself, which on one occasion happened shortly after changing channels where the screen flashed for a moment then the TV shut off.  The other time it happened we were in the middle of a show with no one touching the remote.  For what its worth, we are using an HDMI connection from our cable box--which was the same setup as our older Samsung, which again, had no problems whatsoever.Another issue, while not as important, is that the tuner for this TV is very slow.  If you're a channel surfer, don't bother with this TV.  After changing channels, it normally takes up to 5 seconds for the picture to come up (the wait is usually shorter on non-HD channels).  Its known that HDMI connections cause a little more delay for HDTVs to produce a picture on the screen when first turning on the screen or changing channels, but our 4-year old Samsung HDTV was far quicker in displaying the picture than this brand-new Vizio.What kept this TV from getting a 1-star review was the price and the great picture quality.  Checking the Vizio website, there doesn't seem to be any type of firmware update for this TV, so we're thinking if the TV has these types of problems right out of the box (which other people are obviously having as well), we're just going to avoid any other headaches and send it back.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "false advertising", "Author": "N ew Jersey Consumer", "ReviewID": "R1KIMXBYVBXQX3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "purchased from Amazon Warehouse Deals in \"Like New Condition\" Definatley not in Like New Comndition.

You can still see a slight glow through the layers of tape, but it is not too bad.

It has super clarity on the picture and initially the sound was acceptable.  About 2 days later the sound just quits for a second or up to 5 seconds and then it just pops back on.  On off on off on. Then it may go for 2 hours without a problem and start all over again with the on off on off.  I took the set back to COSTCO and got another new one and brought it home.  It worked great for 8 days.  Now it is doing the same on off on off of the sound.
