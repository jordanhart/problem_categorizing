{"Reviews": [{"Title": "VERY GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY!", "Author": "Easttenn Finest", "ReviewID": "R2FCUMCKKPUUBN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I reviewed some of the comments on this tv, and I must say the negative reviews were so so wrong about this tv. I have a 26\" haier and a 32\" haier and it has good picture. The haier tv is the official hdtv of the nba, so it just brings to me that some people you just cant please at all, I noticed that they have commented on the sound of the tv. The only thing you have to do is buy some average computer speakers to bring the sound out, problem solved but but this tv comes with a soundbar ($99 value) as a bonus that really brings the sound out and it has a ipod dock bulit into the soundbar which is a plus. If your trying to look else where to find a 24\" hdtv it will run you around at least $149.99 and even in other places even higher depending on the make of tv. So bottomline the tv isnt bad, dont believe the bad comments lefted by people who cant be pleased for anything. I love the tv and the size is razor thin it doesnt take up space. So buy now before this deal isnt available anymore.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worthless sound without soundbar and marginal picture", "Author": "drew510", "ReviewID": "R3LWMPHCZ2UJZN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV gets a big MEH from me.  The sound from the speakers is abysmal.  The soundbar is OKAY, but nothing to write home about.  The TV comes with a headphone jack to RCA converter so you can use the soundbar with it - but it lacked the instructions on how to do so.  I figured it out on my own.  Picture quality is marginal.  I picked this up for $141.XX.  I feel sorry for anyone that spent more on it.  If I had to do it all over, I would pass and spend another $40 for a name brand TV.  My folks have a 19 inch Toshiba that has better sound quality and a much better picture.  The iPad/iPhone dock is a nice feature of the soundbar.  It allows you to play music such as iTunes or Pandora and it has an FM tuner.  You can also use it to play videos on the TV (Netflix/YouTube, etc) from your device.  It does not allow you to see what is on you device unless it is video coded, so you can't play Angry Birds and have it displayed on the TV.  If you can get it on the cheap like I did and it will only be used seldomly (like a guest room), this would be an okay purchase.  Otherwise, I would look elsewhere.Additional note:  The description of the TV in the Amazon listing has/had conflicting descriptions of the TV.  What I received was model number LE24B13800 which is a 1080P edge lit LED TV.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV, Bad Sounbar, Horrendous Customer Service", "Author": "N. Heywood \"nuggy\"", "ReviewID": "R1W0QJQZ78K1SI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my daughters birthday, with the absolute intent of using the sound bar and TV as it is advertised (with my Daughters Ipod for video and music). First, the TV works great, but the sound is tinny and poor. The Soundbar worked great for about a day and worked in unison with the TV (video on screen and sound thru soundbar). However after 1 day, the sounbar started to lock up and freeze, the display was unresponsive and finally nothing worked (TV still great). No big deal, so I called Haier (as they request in the packaging). They were great and asked me to remove the serial # tag and sign an affidavit which I returned. They did NOT want me to return the unit (Which I thought was admirable), however I did what they asked and defaced the unit and disposed of it. It has been a month and after multiple calls, they have informed me that they will not replace the unit as they no longer make it, and cant determine what to refund me as it was a combination product. I have called 4 times, each time the people are nice, but I get ZERO follow up. I have finally given up. I get the distinct impression they have no intention of doing anything as I have been told multiple times that they think Amazon was giving it away. I purchased this in good faith for the TV and soundbar, regardless of cost, if the damn thing breaks and the manufacturer requests you contact them first, and then they doing nothing, this in my mind is poor customer service. I contacted amazon, but it was after the 30 days, they wanted me to return the whole unit, but my mistake was to deface the soundbar and dispose of it (lesson learned). The only grace is that I did not pay a huge amount for the products, and my daughter does not care about the crappy sound on the TV. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY HAIER PRODUCTS. BAD BAD BAD SERVICE.PS: Amazon have been great and followed up with me and have offered to help defray the cost.

Mostly the trouble is with darker blues and browns; large patches of these colors become pixelated or blocky.  It looks pretty terrible when this happens, but otherwise the television is okay.  It's lightweight and reasonably stylish.  It's fine for someone who doesn't watch a ton of television or a poor college student like me, but if you watch a lot and have the money, go with something more expensive.The soundbar seemed fine, but I only briefly tested it because I have no room for it.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible sound and awful picture", "Author": "J.

I purchased this from Amazon for 145.xx thinking that I am getting a very good deal, a 1080P TV plus sound bar for under 150.I was planning to use the TV as a monitor for my computer and sound bar for the audio. I was so excited when I received the package, opened it and connected my Samsung HT-E6500 blue ray player via HDMI cable. What I saw was only grey for blacks. The clarity is good but the colors are awful. I compared it with my 6 year old 46 inch Samsung HD TV, which I still love. The new TV is nowhere near my old TV in color, clarity or blacks. I was ready to sacrifice those because of the price I paid. Then I opened the sound bar and connected to the TV. I never heard such a horrible sound from a speaker before. I tried different sources same horrible sound. Packed all items back, contacted Amazon and returned the item for a full refund. Please don't waste your time and money. Go for a good brand for few more bucks.

This is, sort of, our \"extra\" TV. My wife is about to have our first child, so she'll be in the bed for the better part of the day for a few weeks. She needs some entertainment other than the laptop. When I found this deal I could not pass it up (FYI - I paid $160 in March 2013).I didn't expect much - I figured the screen would be passable at best, and thought the volume would be low. I was wrong. The screen is not bad at all. I wouldn't play video games on it (due to low refresh rate), or watch an action-packed movie, but for all other purposes I could see myself using this TV a lot. The sound from the Soundbar is good, for a TV. The sound output for music is decent, but you wouldn't want to rely on it solely at a party.I just recently bought a bluetooth speaker (soundbar) for about $60. It doesn't get nearly as loud as this soundbar. Considering the price I paid for the BT speaker, and the increased volume on the Soundbar, I'd say the soundbar is worth about $40-50 alone. It also has an old iOS device connector, and radio support.The TV is decent, and I could see myself using it as a computer monitor. It also has built-in speakers (which really aren't good - but that is why it's bundled with the sound bar). I would have paid anywhere from $120-150 for the TV alone, based on the other 24\" TVs available on Amazon.The biggest downside is that when using the soundbar, there are a lot of wires sticking out of the side of this TV. Does not make for an aesthetically pleasing experience. That's always fixable, though.I would recommend this to anyone, with the caveat being that it is not a high quality combo - it is a value combo, and you get more than what you pay for with this value. Hooked up just to a Roku, for about $230 you can get a viewing experience people would have only dreamed about 10 years ago.This is a good combo, at a terrific value.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Support", "Author": "FMB", "ReviewID": "R1EODNEKO6W3XC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this item to use as a PC monitor.
