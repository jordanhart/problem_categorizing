{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Samsung 60hz TV to date", "Author": "Dangs \"Dan\"", "ReviewID": "R2DMBLAVWWJWE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was ready to purchase the `12 model year Samsung 5000 series TV when I found out that this updated model was available. My local big box stores did not have the F5000 series in stock yet so I had to take a chance on this set and buy it sight unseen.I would rate myself as a fairly knowledgeable user, and a very picky one at that. I read AV forums online and I constantly tinker with my TVs to get the best picture possible out of them. I am very glad that I waited to get this new '13 model, as the quality and features are substantially improved.For starters, comparing this model side by side with the older Samsung EH5000 models, the first thing you will notice is how much thinner the F5000 is. At 1.9\" thick, it's almost as thin as any LCD TV gets; and its roughly half as thick as the prior model. The 2\" difference really matters, especially for those of you who will be wall mounting the TV. With a low profile mount, the TV is about as flat as one could expect to get.Appearance-wise, the F5000 is a stunning looking TV. The bezel is ultra-thin and glossy black. The bezel bows down slightly in the bottom center of the TV to show off the Samsung logo. Compared to another same size Samsung LCD in our house that is just three years older, the F5000 looks futuristic and sleek. I love the design direction that they have taken in 2013.But all this means nothing if the TV isn't just as fantastic from a performance standpoint. Luckily, the function is well matched to the form.The first thing I checked after getting my TV mounted to the wall was the evenness of the backlight. Our previous non-LED Samsung had a slight \"flashlight\" effect to it. When looking at an all black screen, you could see noticeable bright spots, especially near the corners. My F5000 set, however, appears to be perfectly even from edge to edge. Very impressive considering this is one of their lower end lines.The picture on the TV is excellent. I'm not sure how they achieved it, but considering its only a 60hz panel, the motion is the smoothest I have seen to date. No perceptible blur during fast action on the few shows I've watched so far. Like all other LED TVs, the factory settings have the backlight set too bright and the red level pushed too hard, which makes skin tones appear slightly too unnatural. This is a quick and easy fix in the video settings menu. I've only had the set a short while and am still making adjustments to my settings; I will update this review shortly with a full list of the optimum picture adjustments. But even without a single adjustment, I am just very shocked at how stunning the picture is. Also, I was expecting to immediately disable the \"eco\" features of the TV, but I surprisingly fell in love with one of them. It has a built in sensor that measures the brightness of your room, and adjusts the backlight accordingly. I had my mind set on disabling this right away, but after trying it out, it's actually very well implemented. It is especially useful for anyone using this TV in a bedroom... If you want to lay in bed and watch some TV in the dark, it will dim the picture slightly and keep it from being uncomfortably bright. If I wasn't using it in a bedroom, I'd probably want to disable it. Thankfully, its very easy to access the eco settings to adjust or disable it for those of you who don't care to try it.Right now, I can only think of two Cons to go against the many pros, and they are both minor. The first con is that the backlit remote is very very dimly lit. Even with the backlight activated, it takes a second or two to figure out what each button is. Thankfully though, this becomes a non-factor once you've used it a few times and have the locations memorized. The second con is that the included stand, at least on my 32\", is very cheaply made. Samsung clearly has done some serious cost saving on the quality of the stand. Although they managed to make it look OK, the feel of it is terrible. It's a very thin gauge of reinforced plastic. This isn't an issue for anyone who is wall mounting like myself, but I felt it was worth mentioning. It feels significantly less sturdy than all previous Samsung TV stands that I have owned.One last thing I'll note for those looking to wall mount. Some descriptions list the 32\" version as being VESA 400x400. This is INCORRECT. I can confirm for sure that it is VESA 200x200 for the UN32F5000. The Samsung manual will confirm this, but as of the time of me writing this review, Amazon lists it at 400x400 which is very wrong.Overall, the F5000 series feels like a big step in the right direction for Samsung, and I am thrilled with the TV so far. I will update this review in the near future with my recommended picture settings once I get them dialed in exactly as I want them.EDIT on 6/17/2013:As promised here are the best picture settings I have tried for this set.

The stand in particular is, I believe, pure plastic and seems very unstable sometimes. Not a deal breaker, but something I feel I need to point out.- The preset settings are somewhat dark and displeasing, IMO, so you might want to tweak the settings a bit.Now from a PC gaming standpoint, this is absolutely amazing!! As I said before, it looks great when playing any game, i.e Crysis 3, BF3, Fallout, etc. There is no lag or delayed reaction time on screen at all!One thing I would like to mention is setting-up this TV as a PC monitor. IF you are doing this PLEASE READ THIS TO PREVENT ANY FUTURE FRUSTRATION. You will notice that the screen will look VERY blurry when you first connect your PC to the TV ( In my experience, this was through  HDMI). There is a reason for this, which I won't go through in detail, but to fix this all you need to do is this:1.) Hit menu2.) Go to Source List3.) Hit right twice4.) Find the video connection you are using (Mine was HDMI, again)5.) Hit Tools6.) Hit name, then name it \"PC\"7.) Boom, done. Now you have an amazing PC Monitor!Anyways, overall this TV is versatile and looks stunning for its class. Definite recommendation to anyone looking for a small TV of monitor!", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture & bright screen. Has a transformer", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3PSGXI3WV1OL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for the 22\" version.This tv is wall mounted in our kitchen, which is very well lit & surrounded by windows, yet the screen is bright and colorful. I have both a PS3 and AppleTv hooked up to it, and the picture rivals that of our much more expensive 3yr old 40\" Sony Bravia (which was $1100), the colors don't have quite the depth of the Sony, but the clarity of this TV is better and moving images have more separation from the background image.Tv weighs very little and could easily be held by most any mount. Remote is nice and has a backlight.One complaint I do have is there is no mention of this unit being a lo-volt (12v DC) model. Meaning it requires an included transformer to step down the 120v AC power. This isn't a real problem unless you are wall mounting the tv and suddenly realize that you now have to contend with concealing a 1.5\"x1\"x3.5\" transformer. I almost returned the tv based on this alone, however, the cord on the transformer was long enough that I could conceal the transformer in the cabinet below with my other A/V equipment and pull the wire up throughout the wall with the HDMI cable. This actually worked out to my advantage because the lo-volt wire is much smaller than a typical AC cord so it was easier to hide the wire from the back of the TV to the wall.On a side note, not sure if this TV (being lo-volt) would be a great choice for an RV/Motorhome.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "see notes!  Good bedroom TV or gaming monitor", "Author": "Miwo", "ReviewID": "R107VH190R5G1G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here are some various tidbits that are not really listed in the product description:- Bezel is GLOSSY, Screen is MATTE (very happy, I dont see reflections!)- Stand plastic and is not adjustable at all.  No vertical tilting, or even horizontal tilt.  Definitely the worst part about the TV- Game Mode turns off most image enhancement but cuts down on Input Lag.  I play fighting games that require 1-frame links (inputs within 1/60 of a second).  This TV is fast in game mode and should not hurt your gameplay- Sound quality is mediocre/average at best.  They are TV speakers, so you shouldn't expect much- An IR receiver sits blatantly on the bottom-right hand corner of the bezzle.  It is a small bump on the bottom of the screen.  Rather than put the IR receiver on the bezel or behind the screen, it makes the unit look cheap... so samsung can save a few bucks on each unit- Happy to report no overscan/underscan issues on PC/PS3.  i didnt have to make any adjustments to fill the screen correctly- No VGA input.  Only Two HDMI and One Component input.  Could be a problem if you want to connect a console, blu-ray, and a computer if you only have HDMI connections.  You would need a receiver or switcher obviously.- NON STANDARD POWER BRICK.  It is rated 14v @ 2.5a.  This means max power consumption should be 35W.  Energy star rating of $4 / year.  Could be a real hassle if the power brick decides to go.  Probably need to get a samsung brick, since 14V is not really common!!Hope this helps someone.  I bought this TV without knowing these things, but I am glad it worked out for me.  I use it as a console gaming monitor in my office next to my main PC", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not for Gaming, Specifically PS3, or Standard Def Cable", "Author": "Zack", "ReviewID": "R1FB0BMG81UFS3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "(note: this is a review of the 22\")Good:  Colors. Black levels. Good calibration adjustments. Low latency for gaming.Bad:  This TV has a very bad (or none at all) internal scaler. This means any content that is not 1080p native will be a blurred  and pixelated mess (stretch out an image on your computer for an example). An input device with a decent scaler of it's own can compensate, but not every device has one, which is why it is imperative that any modern TV should include a quality scaler of it's own. I purchased this TV as an upgrade to my PS3 gaming TV, assuming that a TV in 2013 would have a decent scaler (PS3 game scaling is very, very poor). Unfortunately most PS3 games are 720p native, so will be blurred and pixelated. Needless to say, watching SDTV on this TV is especially bad as well. I mention this because I know a lot of people buy these small TVs to put in their kitchens or guest rooms, where there is only standard definition channels. You may be disappointed if you are in this category of buyers.Also there is no way to adjust the screen's position. It is locked in place on the stand. The viewing angles are decent though, so this isn't a huge issue.In short, My 6 year old TV handles 720p (and below) content much better than this one. 1080p native content looks fine, but with a TV this small, it won't look any better than 720p native content would on a 720p display. If you are in the market for a TV this size, you are better off going with a 720p display to avoid scaling issues. If you intend to use the TV simply for watching blu-rays and other 1080p native content, then this TV is a great buy. Otherwise avoid it.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV, bad reviews on this product countered", "Author": "Ryan D", "ReviewID": "R302X9N1UP6I8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It may be the case that Samsung has made some changes in the stand, transformer, and internal scaler.  I've read bitter complaints about these issues.  I'll cover these below.  Note that I'm reviewing the 32\" model.Picture:The picture is great.  I'll start by saying that I'm VERY picky when it comes to picture.  I spent 1200$ on an IPS panel type 2560x1600 monitor for my computer.  So, picture quality is extremely important, and I have a pretty good idea of what I'm talking about.-Out of the box, I felt no immediate need to adjust colors, they looked pretty good.  I might play with it later, but for the time being, default settings look good.-Other settings like contrast, brightness look just about right out of the box, no real need to adjust these either-Backlight - even with darker colors, I don't see any backlight bleed, or other common complaints about similar products.  Backlight is darn even.Appearance:-The appearance is excellent.  It has a very thin black glossy bezel (maybe 1/2\"?).  In terms of the depth of the TV, it is less than 2\".  So, there isn't much \"bulk\" to it.  You get pretty much just picture, without the bulk of many TVs.-No unsightly \"sound bar\" - really - who wants to see that?Stand:-I've seen complaints about the stand being \"unstable\" and \"small\".  Perhaps Samsung has changed the stand they ship it with, or perhaps these people forgot that you have to put in the screws included to make it stable.See the picture I uploaded here on the stand: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2ORC5UGBUX68Q/B00BCGRXD8/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link-You have to install 6 screws - an easy task - to assemble the stand and affix it to the TV.-The stand itself is about 1/2 of the width of the TV, and probably 8\" deep.  So, it is a nice firm base on which the TV resides.  Unless you are playing rough with your TV, I see no reason for it to tip over.  Seems perfectly stable to meSound:-There is not a \"sound bar\" - which is a good thing.  Other TVs have huge unsightly or downright hideous soundbars at the bottom that nobody wants to see.  Sound is in the back of the TV.-Better than my old TV for sure.  I didn't have high expectations for this, but it is certainly not bad.  As far as built-in speakers go, it works just as well as any other.Tuner:I use this antenna: B007RH5GZI-Has a built-in ATSC and QAM tuner.-I only use the ATSC, but it works great.  I'm getting 20 channels over the air.  I had to run the scan twice to pick up a few additional channels, but I can live with that.  The tuner overall works great if you want free TV like me.Other issues:-The 32\" model did not have a transformer built into the cord.  So, no unsightly \"box\" on your cable if you are using this model-There is a review titled \"Not for Gaming, Specifically PS3, or Standard Def Cable\" which complaints about the internal scaler.  As far as the 32\" model goes, I have all kinds of quality coming in from my antenna. I have 480 (standard def), 720, and 1080.  The review states that the internal scaler makes things look awful and pixelated when using non-native resolutions (anything that is not 1080).  I haven't had this issue at all (and we have different models, so there could be an issue with the 22\" maybe).  Standard definition looks better than my old TV (which was native low-def).  720 looks very very good, and of course 1080 looks downright awesome.  Note that if you are using a non-native input resolution (something not 1080), it of course won't look perfect.  You're forcing the TV to \"blow up\" the image, and there is error in this process.  it is not a simple pixel for pixel display as if you were using a native resolution.  So, it has to make some guesses as to what colors different pixels \"should\" be.-I turned off the \"EcoSmart\" option - which changes backlight brightness as a function of room brightness.  Seemed a bit too dim when the lights were on.  This isn't too much of an issue, easy to disable the option (as long as you know it is there!).That's all I have for now.  I give this TV three thumbs up.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small in stature and big on performance!", "Author": "Paul S. Remington", "ReviewID": "RUZLAA0CE29HT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Following in the tradition of its larger cousins, the Samsung UN22F5000 is a 22\"-class LED HD television that offers excellent video quality while holding back on connectivity options and extra features.  It isn't the smallest offering on the block.  That title goes to Samsung's 19\"-class 19F4000.  The UN22F5000 is essentially the same television with one big exception: it offers 1080p with a video resolution of 1920 x 1080.  The 19\" 4000-series television is only 720p.  If you're shopping for a small Samsung television and want to stay in the 1080p world, you'll want to take a good look at the 5000-series UN22F5000.While the UN22F5000 is in the 22\" class, its effective size is actually 21.5\" measured diagonally.  It comes with a nice selection of features, but it does not offer 3D imaging or Smart TV functionality.  It's a fairly basic set in terms of connectivity.  It comes equipped with two HDMI inputs, one USB 2.0 connection, one component video shared with one composite video, and one RF input used for terrestrial and cable television.  It comes with a DTV and analog tuner and is cable ready out of the box.  It contains no audio out or return channels.Its slimline form factor is sure to please consumers, although it does give it a lightweight feel some may say feels cheap.  A television's bulk and weight shouldn't be a sole factor in determining quality performance, and this is certainly true here.  The video performance from this television is excellent, regardless of its actual weight and size.  The thickness of the bezel is a slender .5\" and its weight is a mere 5.7 lbs without the stand.  This is surprisingly light, especially for those used to larger 46\" to 80\" televisions.  Not to worry.  It may be svelte, but it is no wimp in terms of video performance for the money.In terms if features, this television carries the typical, basic features, which includes 60Hz performance with a clear motion rate of 120Hz, DTS premium sound and effects, and Dolby Digital Plus.  If this television has one drawback, it would be with its sound.  It comes with two 3W, downward firing, full-range speakers that are designed to do the job and nothing more.  It's common for television speakers to be limited in their performance and the smaller size of this television enhances this fact.  Regardless, most consumers are less interested in sound quality than they are video quality.  The UN22F5000 offers adequate audio performance, but don't look for wall shaking bass and deep low end.  It is rich in mid- and high-end frequencies, and these are emulated crisp and sharp.  The overall sound is thin, as would be expected from a driver size as is installed in this television.  The downward firing speaker position is ideal, especially for those who will wall mount the television.The UN22F5000 does a nice job of sipping power, which is why it has earned an Energy Star rating.  Power consumption is a modest 18W typical and 35W maximum.  Standby power consumption is under .3W.What's in the box?  Aside from the television, you get a stand, standard remote, battery for the remote, power cable, and user's manual.  The remote is very basic and has no learning features.  The television is VESA wall mount compatible, although the wall mount will have to be purchased separately.  A one-year parts and labor warranty comes standard for consumers.  For commercial users, this is reduced to ninety days.Overall, this is an excellent television for those looking for a smaller-sized set.  Its video quality is on par with larger televisions in Samsung's LED TV line.  It is void of many of the extra bells and whistles of higher-class televisions, such as 3D and Smart TV functionality, but it offers the most basic and important features most consumers are looking for.  Don't look for outstanding audio performance from its full range speakers.  It does offer satisfactory sound that is certainly presentable.  A separate home theater system will expand the audio performance, if sonic quality is important to you.For the price, it's hard to beat the Samsung UN22F5000.

The style of the TV is very nice; the slim design is nice to have but wasn't as significant as I previously imagined.The 60Hz refresh rate is really all you need unless you are using 3D, which I don't care for (especially due to the bigger price tag).  The picture looks great and I haven't fiddled with settings too much.  I'm sure if I changed some settings I could get even better quality out of the set, but I'm satisfied thus far.  I always have the TV set to Game Mode to cut down on display lag and the TV performs very well in this area.  displaylag.com rates this TV as one of the best in terms of display lag, but I haven't had enough experience with TVs to notice one with slow response times.  So far I have thoroughly enjoyed gaming on this set.The TV also doesn't include any Smart TV features, but if you own any modern gaming consoles you can find the apps you want available there.  This makes the TV experience feel a little empty, but I don't feel like I'm missing out by not having a Smart TV.  I looked at Samsung's F5500 model (the same as this with the Smart features) and I liked the idea of the quad stand that comes with it, but the grey stand looked ugly in some reviews for that TV and I much prefer the square black stand.  I thought it would be cool to rout the wire for the Kinect under the quad stand rather than purchase a mount for on top of the TV, but I really couldn't handle the ugly grey stand (if it came with a higher quality one with a chrome appearance, I probably would have went that route because the F5500 also includes 3 HDMI ports instead of 2).One bummer about this set is that it only has 2 HDMI ports.  I have a cable box, 2 gaming consoles and more on the way, so I had to purchase an HDMI switch (I recommend the Kinivo brand).  Samsung makes you pay for the premium models if you want additional HDMI ports, but the Kinivo is a great solution to this problem.Of course some of the more expensive TVs would look nicer and have some other cool features, I think this set is pretty much ideal for anyone in my situation.  As long as you don't need over 50\" screen size, more than 60 Hz refresh rate, 3D, more than 2 HDMI ports, Smart features, or the quad stand, this TV is perfect and a great value.

I was convinced by the positive reviews and because I have a larger Samsung in the living room which I like a lot -- I am familiar with the Samsung setup and organization. My learning curve was next to nothing. The hardest problem was getting the darned stand attached to the darned TV! Trying to insert those tiny screws into their proper holes and getting them nice and tight was hard on my old bones and old eyes. What I like about the TV: ease of set up, works very well with OTA DVT stations and simple rabbit ears -- I am in a 30-35 mile range of stations; I can configure the sound -- the movie selection gives a nice surround sound, but you can also amplify it if hard to hear or want voice the most. I know some people thought sound was bad, but it is more than adequate in a smaller room with the variety of settings available. It works very well with my Toshiba laptop via HDMI for internet, streaming and playing DVDs. I liked the price which kept dropping and I got a refund from Amazon on the original price I ordered at. Saved about another $10. Excellent customer service, arrived in 2 days. In hindsight, maybe I would have preferred a bit larger screen, going toward 24-26 inch IF you could find such an animal.

But if this is not an issue for you then this TV is great.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Garden Gnome", "ReviewID": "R3W0HX8L1KXS42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Samsung TV and I am very happy with all of them.

After waiting for my old cathode ray TVs to die, I finally gave up and bought this one for the kitchen counter and mounted it on a swivel arm recommended to fit on the TV (also from Amazon). The swivel arm works great even though it took half the day to mount on the wall under the cabinets. But that's what I get for continually losing the little screws among the dirty dishes my wife ordered me to wash.I had to upgrade my DirecTV because the older system I had wouldn't let the new TV function well. The screen was very fuzzy with the old DirecTV system. The picture was far worse than the picture on the old TV had been. Fortunately, when I called DirecTV for some technical help, they accurately told me that it was the system being too old and not able to give the new TV what it needed. Sorry for the lack of impressive technical jargon here. My interests lie in other directions, like completing my \"honey do\" lists before my wife gets home. DirecTV installed an entirely new system--dish and HD converter box--for only $25 on a special, and they hooked up the new TV, too. They have specials all the time, so don't ever hesitate to call them. On rare occasions, life can be good.Now, the new TV's screen is a stunning display of crisp beautiful colors. I swear, I wasn't on drugs. It's been several weeks, and all is still good. So, if I had been on drugs, then I would have come down by now, and the TV would be a disappointment instead of impressive.The only thing I don't like about this TV--well two things, actually--is that wretched little ditty that the TV plays when you turn it on and off. It's something like what Windows plays on your computer when you turn it on and off. Unfortunately, unlike Windows, I haven't figure out how to mute the ditty on the TV.The other thing I don't like is that the earphone plug-in is on the side. There's no way to plug in a pair of earphones without turning the TV to the side and fumbling around to find that little hole to stick the plug in. That's a huge inconvenience, especially when I knock over the coffee pot. If I don't use earphones late on a Saturday night, I would be waking my wife up, and she'd be making my life more miserable than it already is. So, instead of risking the coffee pot, I turn on my computer, which doesn't play the little ditty anymore, and I cruise Youtube instead.In all, it's a great TV, especially if you enjoy Youtube.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't bother if you want a clear picture", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R2SWKS9WZMWPH6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not sure what is wrong with this tv but it has something to do with the refresh rate of the screen.

RV specific TVs can cost more than they are worth, and don't have a lot of the nicer features.  After doing a lot of research, I found that this TV uses a 14V converter, which is near the charging voltages for automotive battery systems.  I was a little nervous that it wouldn't operate at lower voltages, as the batteries discharged, but I bet on it being able to handle it.  It paid off --I've had no problems with the unit down to 11V.  It draws very little power, and with my dual battery setup, it can last several days of constant viewing (if I don't use anything else).  And, I can use a large capacity USB thumb drive for playing video files, which none of the RV-specific TVs can do.  It's perfect!Edit: I should add that, instead of cannibalizing the supplied power cord, I made my own using an EIAJ-5 connector (Digikey part #: CP-026-ND).  This allows me to use shore power whenever I have access.Edit: I tested using an independent power supply recently to see just how low it would go before shutting off.  9.9V is about the minimum, which is lower than you should be letting your deep cycle batteries get.

I have a 21 year old loud a/c unit (i bought a foreclosure and haven't updated the unit yet) and this little tv was loud enough to hear clearly over the a/c unit.

In fact, it is an even better deal now that it is much lower in price.  However, it still has a minor problem in that scaling is horrible with non native 1080p content that is scaled across the screen, resulting in pixelation.  The only solution is to not scale the content, resulting in a smaller image.  Another deal breaker for some, especially if wall mounting, is that the power source of this televsion includes a transformer on the power cord.The television is packaged well with very good instructions and everything you need to get going.  The build quality is better than \"no name brands\" in the same range.  However, most of these televions have little differences in build quality these days (in same range)- it is the design you have to look at.  In this case, I love the design of the F5000. It has a slim glossy bevel design with a flat matte screen, which is critical if using in a room in which an amnbient light source will be pointed at the screen (think full sunlit window). I found the stand a little wobbly, though not really unstable.  The F5000 is a very thin TV at about 1.8\" in depth.  Samsung includes a solid backlit remote, which is very nice to have (wish cable companies would use these).Usability is very good though I did experience a very minor backlit issue where, on a pure black screen, I noticed some minor bright spots.  Absolutely no impact on picture quality unless you watch a pure black screen all day. Picture quality is simply fantastic.  Clarity is amazing and the 60hz refresh rate does not impact performance.  Even in fast moving scenes, I experienced no blur or image artifacting. I recommend you reduce the factory pre-set brightness right out of the box.  Also, allow the TV a week or so to break in (sounds weird, but true).  Sound was acceptable for a small room.  However, in larger rooms, especially with vaulted ceilings abd hardwood floors, a supplemental sound bar is required.  For a bedroom or even mid-sized room, without vaulted ceilings and a hardwood floor, sound is fine.  Though not a \"true dedicated gamer,\" we tested gaming capability with an Xbox360 and a couple of fast moving graphic intensive games.

However, when checking an identical display version in a store, I seen the same problem. I am beginning to believe that this is an issue only on the 22 inch version as I cannot seem to find an issue like this on larger screens. Ultimately, I don't expect this to be an issue for me once I mount the TV on a tiltable mount.

I should mention that I'm not a monitor buff, we're pretty basic in what we need, but I wanted something thin and lightweight that would take up less space in the room than the 2007 Aquos we had. The picture and sound quality on the TV is fine, seems to be at least as good as the Aquos, and it's much much lighter and easier to hang without worrying that it's going to fall of the wall and crush my kids. There are two annoyances I've had so far:1 - While the TV is extremely thin, you will have to mount it 1.5\" away from the wall if you're using more than one HDMI port or component cables (we still have a DVD player -- again, we may be unusual). But the fact that only one HDMI port faces sideways essentially means that you lose a lot of the nice flatness against the wall that you should get from a thin TV; we had to go find spacers for the wall mount and you can see more of the assembly back there than I'd like. This is minor, but I think it's one of the reasons people buy a skinny TV, so it seems annoying.2 - No physical buttons at all. I know this is getting more and more standard, but it's annoying not to have at least power and input buttons on the top, side or back of the frame. We have multiple generations in our house and I may be the only one who actually knows how to run the universal remote, so everyone just wants a power button. Also, strangely, this TV takes about 5 seconds to find the input every time you turn it on, and in the meantime a window pops up saying \"connection lost\" -- also confusing to my household.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "Kat", "ReviewID": "R26NOZ5L097BZE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been without at TV for about two years.

Buy 32-inch.", "Author": "Roger", "ReviewID": "RALE447GHXYV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought both, a 22-inch Samsung (UN22F5000) and 40-inch Samsung (UN40F5000) LED televisions.Of all the models of the UN{size_in_inches}F5000 model of televisions, the 22-inch one only puts out three watts audio, and the 22-inch is much like a small computer monitor, making the 22-inch only sensible for small dormitory use.  However I have this 22-inch mounted on the wall within a small kitchen, and the sound and video size is just barely adequate.  Moving to a 32-inch for a small kitchen would have likely made reading the on screen menu text much easier.The other models provide 10 watts audio, including an ECO mode for automatically adjusting the backlight according to room brightness.PROS:1) Very light compared to old televisions.2) Easy to wall mount.3) Except for the 22-inch, the televisions have S/PDIF Toslink output.4) Very good picture compared to other televisions, and according to other's reviews and being a popular buying choice.5) Has plenty of features needed by most users, reserving additional features for the more expensive models.  (ie. SmartTV)6) Remote control is always dimly lit whenever buttons are pushed.  (I really wish my Yamaha receiver had lit buttons!)CONS:1) I'm thinking, the remote control has some poorly located buttons or keys.  For example, the mute key is commonly located below or above the volume keys.  Other commonly used keys are located away from the center of the remote control key pad, such as the \"P Size\" key for adjusting the video stream's size to fit the monitor.2) The on screen info text describing the video stream's title and video header information doesn't remain on screen while changing channels.  Most times when people are changing channels, they're wanting to know what is currently on TV and are likely wanting to read the title and about information.  After changing channels, people need to continuously press the Info key to see this information.  Also, only \"what's on next\" is displayed within the channel information.  Most channel changing boxes allow this buy selecting the TV Guide button, and using the left and right keys for changing the channel while displaying the Channel information.  Not really intuitive, but I think I figured how to find this extended guide by clicking the \"Channel List\" key and using the right cursor key twice for a selected channel.  The guide does then detail a 12 hour TV guide, the time span available is applicable to your local broadcasting area.3) The remote control doesn't have a stylish inverted dome for the up, down, left, right and select keys; which would allow easier menu settings navigation.  I constantly find myself getting lost within the menu settings because I'm usually pressing the wrong navigation key!  (ie. Unique key shapes can aide with memorizing the key functions of the remote or using concave shapes for up, down, left, and right keys.)4) Monitor's on and off button is located behind the monitor, and not well known or visible to most initially using the TV.  (Users may initially believe they can turn-off the monitor using only a remote.)5) Even at 10 watts speaker output, the speakers are still just barely audible at 90-100% volume level.  One of the likely reasons, the speakers are embedded and facing down towards the floor, and further away from the viewer if the display is tilted.  Since most have a stereo system and are piping the audio through either HDMI or S/PDIF Toslink, this is likely not much of an issue, but this model does not have S/PDIF or HDMI output and only has two channel PCM RCA jacks.  However within the software menu settings, there is an amplify option under the sound settings.  The amplification seems adequate for the kitchen now!6) Channels are slow to change after pressing buttons.  Also just after power-on, the unit doesn't accept any key presses for five seconds or more.7) Turning the TV on, takes 3-5 seconds and considered very slow.  Matter of fact, the TV is just slow to respond when initiating most functions with the remote control.  (ie. Switching inputs between TV Tuner and other HDMI inputs is aggravatingly slow.)8) The auto on/off or programmed timers is quickly implemented.  The TV will not power-on when using another input other then TV when last turned-off.  (ie. The TV will not auto turn-on if the TV was last using a HDMI input versus TV tuner.)9) The programmed timers conflict, if the off-time is 6:00PM and another timer is using a 6:00PM on-time.  As such, users need to have the TV turn-off one minute prior to the start of a another timer setting.  (ie. The TV must be off in order for a timer to be activated.  The TV will not simply tune while on to a new channel designated by a new timer.)10) The mute key puts a static mute icon on the TV screen, and then goes to an intermittent scrolling flashing mute icon!  For those having their large screen TV's attached to their home stereo systems (which will likely be the majority with larger screen models), this is quite irritating!  I find it's more desirable to simply turn the volume down, however more tedious as this operation should be a one button push.Although a few hiccups, still a very good product.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung TVs'", "Author": "L.

Instead, I opted to use the government issued coupons to purchase two converter boxes for my two analog televisions. One of the converter boxes (RCA brand) died within two years of purchase, and the second converter box began to give signs of trouble recently. I realised I had to decide whether or not to purchase another converter box for $30 to $50 average cost, or purchase a digital telly. The decision was not an easy one as both of my analog televisions still work beautifully, and I generally do not replace electronic equipment so long as it is in good working order.I began to weigh the pros and cons. I realised I could easily purchase several more converter boxes before both of my analog televisions \"gave up the ghost,\" and at $30 to $50 average cost per converter box, I decided it was worth it to find out which digital tellies were available for a reasonable cost. As always, I began by looking at reviews on Amazon. This Samsung F5000 series had a huge number of very enthusiastic reviews. I wanted the 22\" model as I live in a quite small home and watch telly in my bedroom. After a reasonable search, I found the 22\" model on Walmart.com for $166. For an extra $25 I could add the four year extended warranty, and shipment to my local Walmart would be pretty quick. I decided to try it secure in the knowledge that should I not like it for any reason, Walmart would take it back within ninety days of purchase with my receipt.Following are my lists of the pros and cons of Samsung F5000 22\" telly:Cons:(1) The plastic stand has to be attached to the telly's column with three screws. I have slender fingers, but I was still unable to position the screws into the slots in order to screw them into place as the holes are located so deeply down within the telly's column. Luckily, I was able to use a needle nose pliers to get the screws into position, and from there I used a phillips screw driver to screw them into place. It took a few minutes to do this, and it was a little frustrating. I would wish subsequent models would have more easily accessible slots for the screws. A buyer is always anxious to get a piece of equipment \"up and running,\" and this sort of immediate slow down at the start is frustrating.(2) The power cord on the 22\" model has a \"brick\" in it. This is for some sort of electrical current conversion, or so I am told. I really wish it did not have a brick as it is just one more thing to sit out and get in the way, not to mention collect dust. On the plus side, the brick is not too large and heavy as was the brick on my old laptop, but still, I would prefer a power cord without a brick. I understand the 32\" model does not come with a brick.(3) The speakers are not very good quality. The sound they transmit is not deep and rich like the sound from my analog televisions. Turned up as loud as possible, I can hear the sound from the bedroom (the telly's location) whilst I am in the kitchen, but if there is outside noise, or if the dog barks, it completely drowns out the speakers. I only listen to the telly from the kitchen if I get up to get a drink, but still, the point is that the speakers leave a lot to be desired. The sound they transmit reminds me of those old 9 volt transistor radios we used to have as kids. Yes, you can hear the broadcast, but it is tinny and easily drowned out by ambient noise. The sound is adequate if you are in the room with the telly.(4) The last con, and it is the most significant one for me, is that this television as well as all of the other new digital televisions do not \"push out the picture\" to my DVD player/recorder. I spoke to a tech at my local telly repair shop, and he explained to me that the old analog sets \"pushed out the broadcasts\" to other equipment such as a DVD recorder and/or a VCR recorder. DVD and VHS recorders are unable to record from the new digital tellies UNLESS they have their own digital tuners. If you have a DVD recorder or a VHS recorder that does not have its own digital tuner, you will not be able to record over the air broadcasts from this telly. In order to record over the air broadcasts, you must have a recorder with its own digital tuner. Otherwise, either you will have to subscribe to a service such as cable or satellite, or you will have to have a converter box hooked up between the telly and the DVD or VHS recorder.For me, this was an enormous disappointment. One reason I purchased a digital telly was to obviate the need for a converter box. As I mainly watch only PBS, and as my budget is tight, I had neither the need nor the desire to subscribe to cable or to satellite television. The best solution for me now will be to purchase a DVD recorder with its own digital tuner so that I can record programmes that I do not want to miss or that I want to save for some reason, but I will not purchase a DVD recorder with tuner any time soon.Firstly, there are not many models to choose from, and secondly they cost more than the new telly. Moreover, my experience with a relatively recent purchase of a DVD recorder with its own tuner was not good. After I purchased a JVC DVD/VHS combo recorder with its own digital tuner two years ago, the tuner in it died in less than 18 months with less than average use. I paid $250 plus shipping for the DVD/VHS recorder, but the cost to replace the tuner was a whopping $379. The shop told me the cost reflected the fact that JVC no longer produced the part, so they would have to find another DVD recorder from which they could extract a tuner to put into my DVD recorder. Of course, this solution made no economic sense whatsoever. Moreover, I spent $40 for the shop tech to diagnose the problem, which meant that I had basically thrown away well over $300 on the JVC DVD/VCR recorder.Thus, I am wary of purchasing another DVD recorder with tuner at this time. If I decide to purchase another one in future, I definitely will purchase an extended warranty for it. The repair shop tech advised me not to expect from these new televisions and recorders the long life I used to get out of the old ones. Apparently, they simply are not made to last more than a few years, whereas my old analog sets generally lasted me around 15 years, and my old JVC VHS recorder lasted me at least eleven years even though it was used quite heavily. Sadly, I cannot expect to see that kind of product longevity anymore.Pros:(1) I love the slim profile and small foot print of the 22\" model. It takes up only a fraction of the table top space that my clunky old 20\" analog television took up.(2) I also love the light weight of the 22\". It does not feel much heavier than my MacBook Air, which is quite light weight; hence, it is highly portable. For its size and weight, this set fits beautifully on the table in my bedroom, on the counter top in the kitchen, and on the little rolling tea table in my small living room. So, if I ever need to watch it whilst cooking, for example, or if I need to bring it to the living room so that a guest and I can watch together, it will be a doddle to move it from the bedroom.(3) This set tuned in more digital broadcasts than my old converter box. For some reason, my old converter box could tune in my local PBS station, 13.1, but no matter what I did, it never would tune in PBS 13.2, which for me was significant as I view only PBS 99% of the time. This telly tuned in 13.2 without any problems.(4) This telly is estimated to cost only $13 a year to operate based on a usage of five hours per day. I do not know how much it cost me to operate my old analog tellies, but I am sure it was probably at least double this amount. Thus, the savings in operation cost of this telly over my old analog telly will help it pay for itself.(5) The picture quality is quite good. The last few televisions (with one exception) I owned were all Sony brand. I always liked Sony's quality of skin tones over any other brand. As I have not been able to watch my old Sony in a few years due to its converter box dying, I cannot do a side by side comparison, but I estimate that the sharpness and the colour quality of the Samsung F5000 series competes very well indeed with my old Sony. Personally, I am unable to tell the difference between the HD digital picture on this set and the picture on my old analog set, but perhaps that is just me. Perhaps others will be able to discern a significant difference. To my eyes, however, they look the same.(6) Finally, I was able to hook up my DVD player to this telly with minimal effort. It is nice not to have to struggle to connect components.Overall, at this price point, I highly recommend the Samsung F5000 series over its competitors for its compact size, light weight, and very good picture quality. I looked at other brands at Best Buy, but I did not see another brand I liked as well. This 22\" Samsung had the best picture compared to other brands of the same or approximate same size. The set is a keeper for me. I have only had it a week or two thus far, but I look forward to finding out how long it will work before I encounter any problems with it.  The main reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because of my disappointment in its inability to \"push broadcasts\" to my DVD recorder, but I would have the same disappointment in all other brands of these new digital tellies as well.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "love this tv", "Author": "gail vissichelli", "ReviewID": "R2YPKGMF1SK8UD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this TV it is a low voltage tv that is perfect for the mount that I bought.

After reviewing all the smart TV's I could stomach, I finally realized that the smart TV's are designed by nerds who want to make all the decisions for you. I personally do not like my devices telling me what I like to do. I also discovered the nerds limit your ability to scroll to different channels from the 5 choices the smart screen assures you that you want to watch. That means you are having to battle a bunch of stuff just to find a particular channel or show that is different from their choices. I knew that my mom would freak when she tried to use a TV that came up with a million little boxes to go through just to watch TV. I also like the Roku 3 external box as it is easy, so I bought her the external Roku box, mostly so I could leave the smart features off her TV. She just punches the source button, chooses HDMI, and she uses it with Netflix only. It works flawlessly so I didn't have to load all the smart features on her TV. She just disregards most of the remote, and her TV works like a TV. The only thing I do not like about this set is the unwieldy stand that is designed straight from the Jetson age.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Use it as a monitor.", "Author": "ndrew73 \"ndrew73\"", "ReviewID": "RCHZW0R07RVN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought a used one.

This past Black Friday, however, I popped on to Amazon and saw this particular TV in the deals section and purchased it after checking several other store websites and I'm glad I did.While it wouldn't do in my parents' living room, for me, it's perfect.  It fits nicely on the shelf with my blu-ray player and wii, isn't easily knocked over by my cat, and the power switch isn't easily hit by said cat either.  And while I'm sure anyone might say this going from a nearly 10 year old tv to a nice new 1080p LED, the resolution is wonderful--crisp and clean.  The speakers took a day to get used to, I remember thinking the first day that the sound was a bit tinny, but I chalk that up again to the previous TV having been so old.  And it's probably silly to mention, but it was nice to find that I could label my connections so I don't have to flick between the components to find the wii, the blu-ray player, or the cable box as I had to with the previous TV.As an avid movie watcher, I'm pleased with the fit of this into my home, but definitely couldn't see this being the primary television in a larger apartment or house.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Stephen K.

It is incredibly thin & light!  Fits anywhere.  Clear picture!  Great colors & detail.  Sound OK--you might have to raise the sound a little bit--beyond 50, but it works ok with me.  Got this before Christmas for my DVD's.  In order to get the best benefits from this 1080p TV you need to have matching 1080p technology--which is blu ray DVDs & player--it makes NO sense not to have a blu ray player with this 1080p TV if you want to watch DVDs.  Before purchasing this TV, I knew nothing about the new technology.  Now I watched for the first time The Ten Commandments & Season One of Star Trek the Next Generation on blu ray 1080/24p!  It was an experrience TO DIE FOR!  I am beyond happy.  I have my blu ray player plugged in with HDMI cable connection & my old player plugged in with the three prongs--both at the same time.  I can use one or the other.  I have antenna, but that is not the best choice for this 1080p TV.  If you want incoming TV programming to be 1080p. then you need to upgrade the matching technology.  You don't need cable, but you will need additional equipment.  However 1080p is a dream come true for me when I watched Star Trek on HD!  & the Ten Commandments with costumes & jewelry all in HD!  I can't wait to watch the entire Star Trek NG in blu ray!  I am in heaven with this New TV.Note added January 18, 2014.  TV working very well.

Inputs on the back include an HDMI port, a combined set of RCA composite/component jacks, an RF jack, and a headphone jack. There's also a USB port and a second HDMI port on the right side. Optical audio out, and maybe VGA, would have been nice additions, but no dice.Picture quality is excellent with adjustments. Vibrant colors and sharp picture. Surprisingly, Samsung keeps the 120Hz motion enhancer off by default (which pleased me!) Sound quality...well, the TV is less than 2 inches thick. It has some WEAK speakers inside. I'd recommend getting external speakers for this TV set. The remote is small and somewhat confusingly laid-out. It also has a backlight, though it is uneven.The surprise feature of this TV, for me, was the USB Media Play. Its video codec support is PHENOMENAL. You can check the user manual for the full table of supported codecs, but what I was most excited about was H.264 support (up to 1080p, High L4.1, 30Mbps), MKV support, AC3 & DTS support, and internal & external subtitle support. It's not a \"Smart TV\", so it lacks network streaming, but Samsung deserves major props for putting way more effort into this feature than anyone would expect them to.I'd recommend it, on the condition that you get external speakers.

As my home-built computer has HDMI out, hook-up was easy and, after a few contrast and back lighting adjustments, I got a very satisfactory desktop.As far as the other capabilities, I have it hooked via an antenna to the local over the air translator system system. The tuner does a good job and is at least as good as our main TV (a 3 year old Visio).I like the fact that this TV will handle 2 HDMI inputs in addition to a component/composite video input. It can read a USB memory stick as well. Both the HDMI and Component video inputs give a very good picture. I have played with the USB input a little and have verified that it recognizes and plays AVI and MP3 files. I have not tried all types of audio and video files to determine which it recognizes but I have verified that it does not recognize wave files or H264 compressed video files.Sound is what you would expect from the tiny built-in speakers but is much better through the headphone jack.The only negatives I have found to date are the location of the headphone jack (on the backside of the set where it is hard to get to in my application) and the limited ability to recognize many audio and video formats (Come on, it's only software). For my application, though, these are only quibbles and not significant disadvantages.Highly recommended with the caveats listed.Penmouse", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tV", "Author": "mark", "ReviewID": "R33CUZKGH62DNY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very clear picture, great sound, very easy to operate.

The stand is sturdy; it's held in place with self-tapping screws. I make sure to cinch down each screw as I proceed; I find this avoids problems down the road.The unit is plug-and-play. Connect it to a power outlet and a cable jack. Power it up, and it goes into an interactive guided process for setting the various parameters, including scanning for available channels.After the plug-and-play process was complete, I tweaked a couple of the settings through the menu to satisfy my preferences for screen brightness and sound quality.

Right out of the box it was light as a feather and just looked cheap. I didn't care as long as it had good picture. The sound was okay but the picture for landscape (trees, grass) or of people was smudgy like a water color effect. It wasn't crystal clear like my other Samsung TV. I don't know who Samsung is making their TV anymore but the screen quality of this TV wasn't even doable. I called Samsung help number but they couldn't help me fix the problem. So I got this TV delivered today, Friday 3/29/13 and it is going back Monday 3/31/13. Amazon is having UPS pick it up for me. I don't know what to order now.

Right from the box, I received a refurbished TV that would reset itself and would not allow me to get past the main menu. I have to admit that I was a bit upset after anticipating my first LED HDTV. I had read so many good reviews about this specific TV and purchasing from this seller but on the contrary, that has not been my experience.  I admit, I took the risk in purchasing a TV that I thought was going to be repaired and refurbished but this was not the case.  Luckily, I was able to call Samsung Technical Support and they helped me to troubleshoot the problem, advising me to plug the TV into the wall outlet rather than my power strip where it would get more electrical power to run it.  I did this and the problem went away temporarily.3 weeks later, the TV started resetting itself again, and again, I could not get past the main menu.  This time, it was still plugged into the wall as advised but the problem seemed worse as I could not turn off my TV because it wouldn't allow me to until after what seemed like 20 automatic resets.  Again, I called Samsung Technical Support to find out that my warranty for service on this TV had expired in October of 2013.  We were in January 2014!  Thank God they were generous enough to send a technician out for a one time favor with no cost to replace the motherboard on the TV.In the meantime, while waiting for Samsung to get back to me, I contacted Amazon's technical support to see if they could provide me with additional assistance.  They were helpful but could not resolve the issue.  The representative ended up assisting me in e-mailing the seller on January 11 to notify them that they could not resolve the issue and requesting for a replacement or a full refund.  The representative from this company, Brandis, responded to them on January 14, and finally called me on January 17 apologizing for the technical problems on my order and said that she would contact the seller to see if I could receive a replacement or a full refund.It is now, January 27, and I still have yet to hear from the seller about whether I will get a replacement or a full refund on my television.  I do not want to take another risk with this TV knowing that I have had to call Samsung technical support twice and that my warranty has already expired on this product.  I hardly write negative reviews on Amazon because I have always had satisfactory experience or above satisfaction experience.

Maybe $2,500.00 - $3,000.00 is not a lot of money for some folks to spend on a television, but it is to me.  This is money I'll never get back, nor derive true enjoyment, nor value from due to the DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG product that I purchased.  After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.  This problem is systemic in all their LCD's and LED's.  Consumer's have complained all over the internet.  There are even numerous Youtube postings with the exact same problems as in my DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG model, as well as the same DEFECT in many other DEFECTIVE SAMUNG models.  This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00!Furthermore, I was informed that the repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....at which point the technician basically stated, \"just buy another TV.\"SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at a rate of 20% per year, and that they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!  Their own repair people told me to just buy a new set!!!If I save one family the heartache of losing they're hard-earned money on SYSTEMICALLY DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG TELEVISIONS, and a company that offers zero customer service....I'll be happy!

Next, in less than 24 hours ups has tried to pick up the damaged tv during wkday morning, but we are provided no contact information for carrier to arrange different pick up time.
