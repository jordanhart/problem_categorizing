It is a 22 inch flatscreen TV for less than $300, so that is awesome however the picture is really not that great. I have tried changing the color settings many many times and still it doesn't quite look right. The HD channels that I get look pretty good but not the best I have seen.This is definitely an entry-level flat-screen TV. If I could I would give it 3.5/5 stars.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lightweight LCD TV", "Author": "Margaret C.

It is in the bedroom & I didn't need it to be a large size.  Sounds is great, picture isn't good.  I will shop around alot more for a much better one for the living room.  It is a learning experience to be sure.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little t.v.", "Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "RWZDG7QMRGKKO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this t.v. for our bedroom. I didn't need a super high quality HD t.v. and didn't want to spend the money on it either. So, I bought this one. It fits perfectly in the bedroom. The sound is good, but could be better. It's not a common brand so my ATT Uverse remote works, but not all the functions are there (mute for example). I've not had any problems with it. I like it a lot. A sleek little t.v. and good quality for the price. Would definitely recommend to friends as a low cost t.v. solution.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Misses the Mark With the Basics", "Author": "Amazoning", "ReviewID": "RI3CEEKTUEOHQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this television on sale after my two year old, analog Magnavox stopped working.  This Haier television is, at best, mediocre and definitely not worth full price.  Not worth more than $150 max.  There isn't a tilt-stand on the set, nor in the packaging.Pros:Good SoundHas AVL (the thing that keeps the volume down during commercials)Very lightweightCons:Picture quality is not greatATSC/NTSC built-in tuner does not save channels on re-scanAlso, does not indicate broadcast signal strength (I have to use my freestanding tuner to check signal strength)Update:  I called Haier, and they confirmed that the built-in tuner does not display signal strength.My opinion: this is an okay television, as long as you are not relying on OTA (Over The Air) broadcasts.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "For the price... it's a great TV!", "Author": "L.

Once I hooked it up to external speakers, the problem was solved.- The viewing angle is really narrow.
