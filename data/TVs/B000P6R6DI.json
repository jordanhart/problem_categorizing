{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is very good model if you want a Sony!", "Author": "Greenpia", "ReviewID": "RLBNKLBM0HTP9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this Bravia for my dad as gift.I found stores that has less price than Amazon, but with so many things that can go wrong with flat TV, I decide to stick with largest (more trustworthy??) internet resaler. Overall, I am happy with decent price, no shipping charge, no tax. This TV would have cost me at least 400 more on my local Best Buy or Circuit City.My dad has strong brand preference to Sony, so I just went with it.Because of Sony name, this (even though it is lowest priced Sony LCD TV) model probably cost few hundred dollar more expensive than competition.Generally, this is good TV.I was debating on getting larger size Plasma or smller size LCD (Sony don't make Plasma anymore)...I picked LCD even though I sometime feel Plasma is better solution for many reasons.Size is decent... somewhat small if you view it from more than 10 feet away. Consider your viewing distance before you buy any flat TV. Your TV will last more than 6 years and you might consider buying maximum size you can afford.This TV is HD, but not full HD. My dad is not technology guy and he is not going to spend money on BlueRay or High Def DVD player...so this fits.Amazingly, my dad's retirement community doesn't even carry HD on their cable system until next year, so I had to settle for watching regular quality programs.Here, I don't see any wow's...but everything seems good.No problem with banding, colors, nor bad pixel...Lighting sensor is good feature. It really does adjust according to brightness and it makes my eyes more comfortable...although it does become little darker than I would have liked.Design is good. Not in a sense of modern piece but more in the function. It is very simple and very conservative. But outside frame is thin and it is not reflective (My brother's Samsung has reflective frame and it is sometimes gets in the way of viewing). It is somewhat classic...Delivery with Amazon via Eagle was great. It came after 6 working days. They unpacked it, put on top of TV stand which I bought from Circuit city, and connected cable to see TV work.My dad was quite happy with whole process.One mistake: Eagle didn't know my phone number (I don't know why Amazon didn't provide my number) so I had to call them up to set up delivery date.Overall, I am quite happy with my purchase, happy with TV, and Amazon buying experience.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fabulous TV", "Author": "Steven E.

I patiently waited for my Consumer Report magazine last month before purchasing - this was their second highest rated LCD in this size.  It was worth the wait - fantastic quality all the way around and so easy to set up and use.  Delivery was quick and in less time than promised (all the way from Montana to Georgia).  Ordering on-line saved me over $400 too.  I highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Bravo for Bravia!", "Author": "Cindy C.

My set is a new build in Feb. 2008.  I have no clouding issues, backlight is very uniform, and colors and blacks are great right out of the box.  I agree with Consumer Reports that with a good signal you are hard pressed to see any difference with a 1080P set of which I have one as well.Positves: No shiny screen or bezel, great standard definition, amazing HD, no motion problems that I can see, great price as these are probably being phased out, lots of zoom modes to your preference, plenty of color controls, enough inputs and outputs for most people.Negatives: Really none to speak of!", "Date": "April 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellet TV; excellent service", "Author": "VN", "ReviewID": "R1YEG3TYVERYQM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This 46\" TV is an excellent buy.  Great picture and sound even on standard definition broadcasts and regular DVDs.  Ordered it from Amazon.  Vanns picked up the order and delivered it by MyYellow truck in about a week.

It is a 720 instead of the 1080 but our understanding was that very few people will notice the difference.  We cannot see any difference and saved about 700.00 by going with the 720.  Sony is an excellent choice for quality.  Amazon shipped this to us and we were pleased.  The product was received quickly.  We highly recommend this tv for the quality and recommend buying online since we saved quite a bit of money buying online instead of in a box store.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing quality and delivered on time by Amazon", "Author": "Sitaraman Lakshminarayanan \"Ram\"", "ReviewID": "ROUNBY14FN4NX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very impressed by the Sony HD and more than that the Amazon delivery service.

Even though it's \"only\" 720p, the picture quality when watching HD channels and DVD's is excellent. The quality of regular TV channels is decent and watchable. We also use it to watch Netflix streaming movies through our computer and the experience  is surprisingly good.If you buy from Amazon, don't forget to watch the prices for 30 days after the purchase. If the price is reduced, Amazon will refund you the difference. We got almost $100 back this way, but they will not do it automatically.

The Sony Bravia was a snap to hook up, I used one HDMI cable from the cable box, and the other HDMI cable from the DVD into the back of the Sony Bravia, and I was all done!  Simple.  The set looks outstanding, and comes with a clear manual of instructions.  It will do a lot more than I need (i.e. PIP) and yet it is simple to operate.  An excellent buy for the money, and a Consumer Reports \"Best Buy\" in their recent magazine (according to my brother who noticed it).  I highly recommend this set since 720p is what the stations will be broadcasting in and the picture is fabulous.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Sony, but why the high price for this 720p vs a 1080p?", "Author": "top hat and tales", "ReviewID": "R2LS0EDROX5CAY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No complaints with the TV.  Excellent picture, etc.  But the specifications on this 46S3000 (Costco) aren't nearly as good as similar Sony models with with far better specs.  Had initial problems with judder, but Sony customer service walked me through steps to alleviate this.  Still, I am wondering why I've paid so much for this particular model.  I DO like it, but I keep asking myself the question of whether this purchase is good value for the dollars spent.", "Date": "April 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Quite pleased with my choice", "Author": "Donald E. Williams \"Rideone 45\"", "ReviewID": "R105QPQFPJ1TTY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the SONY 720p / 1080i BRAVIA KDL-46S3000 LCD TV and the Toshiba HD-A3 HD-DVD player from AMAZON; the HD-A3 arrived in perfect condition via UPS in only two days and the Sony Bravia was delivered by Eagle two days ahead of schedule, (It was a bit of luck that I was home when Eagle delivered because EGL failed to call to coordinate the delivery day and time). EGL un-packed and gave instructions to wait for the TV to equalize at room temperature before powering up (preventing any moisture condensation) A couple of hours later I powered it up. Both worked and looked beautiful, I am extremely pleased with the picture and features.Regarding the Toshiba HD-A3, after reading a few negative reviews I was concerned about people having trouble with the unit, and comments about slow boot-up. I had no problem didn't even go through the instructional set-up, just plugged it into my new SONY BRAVIA via HDMI cable and inserted a HD DVD.The player booted-up in about the same time as my old DVD player and started playing the movie. HD DVD's look excellent at 1080i or 720p, the up converted standard DVD's look great as well, not as good as the HD DVD but better than progressive 480p.All in all I highly recommend this player and LCD TV for anyone. The HD-A3 price is much more attractive than other HD DVD players.It is limited to 1080i highest resolution; compared to newer more expensive players that output 1080p. In my opinion the 1080p is not worth the extra money at this point.  I am sure that in a couple of years I will be able to up-grade to a larger LCD TV and 1080p player for less than I paid for the 1080i / 720p system I purchased this year.As far as the SONY BRAVIA, \"it's a SONY\" and I like it much better than my Mitsubishi 55\" DLP. At this price I will take a SONY to any other brand!", "Date": "December 7, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "HDTV with ATSC\u00bf Digital Tuner\nBRAVIA Engine\u00bf full digital video processor\n16:9 HD Resolution Panel (1366x768)\nLive Color Creation featuring WCG-CCFL backlight\n1080p Inputs - HDMI\u00bf (x2), YPbPr (x2), PC Input (x1)", "Name": "Sony Bravia S-Series KDL-46S3000 46-Inch 720p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311bDfLdvLL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000P6R6DI"}}
