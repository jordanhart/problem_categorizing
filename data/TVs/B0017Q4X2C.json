I was tempted to get Sony's S model in this size, but the M is a newer model, and $50-$80 cheaper.  Picture quality is, overall, equal to my larger set, (though fleshtones are more natural on the \"S\") which cost twice as much.  However, I was surprised that it does not come with the stand attached.  Not a big deal, but I've never seen this practice before.  Also, unlike the S series classy flat black matte finish, this M model has the \"Samsungy\" glossy piano black finish.  Again,not a big deal..but still.  Anyway, despite all my nitpicking, it is the picture that really matters, and in that area, this set delivers in Sony tradition..excellent.  For the money, a great set, a great value, but it will remind you it is entry level, something the S models did not do...of course, Sony's least, is still better than it's competitors best.", "Date": "May 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "One Day and Happy", "Author": "J.

Rich colors, high contrast, & a nicely sharp picture.  It was correctly adjusted at the factory.  It appears to offer a good range of custom picture adjustment, which I haven't explored yet.  Viewing angle makes little difference, as long as you're somewhere in front of it.Sound quality is good, not great.  Small tv speakers are never going to produce great sound, but it's definitely listenable.  I plan to connect it to some stereo speakers, but haven't done that yet.The set appears to be very well built.  I'm using the included stand, which seems plenty sturdy.  It was easy to attach the screen to the stand.I found the initial setup a nuisance, because it took a very long time to scan for channels - however, I use a cable box, so there's only the one channel for it to receive.  Scanning for other channels was a total waste of time.  I don't mark that against the tv, since it only happens once.  But it does seem to me that a more intelligent setup process would be helpful.  A person can't really hold that against the tv, it's a decision by the designers.I intend to try it as a second monitor for my laptop computer, but I can't comment on that now, since I don't have the hookup cable yet.(Edited to add -- I got the cable, to use this Sony with my Powerbook G4, and it works fine.  Also, I discovered it works with my little old 12\" iBook, that I've kept as a backup laptop.  The iBook is limited in its ability to handle this Sony as a display, but it does work.)In sum, I'm glad I bought this Sony, and I do recommend it.

The picture is sharp and contrasty (though component input isn't perfect), sound quality is OK and features are more than plenty for my purpose. I especially like the selection of inputs and the ability to relay audio out to my stereo. But the clincher for me was the viewing angle: It is much better than the Samsung 26A450, which is the main competitor in terms of image quality (face-on the Samsung seems a little better). We have the TV set on a shelf, higher than the seating position, and there is literally no difference in picture for a large range in vertical (and horizontal) viewing angles. There is no discernible color shift or shadow loss, both of which are clearly visible for most of the competition.

After getting burned by two straight bad 32\" HDTVs from other brands, not wanting to spend more money for the more expensive 32\" sets, and seeing that a 32\" screen is a little too big for my small bedroom, I decided to look one size smaller and get a good 26\" television at the same price range.I singled out this Sony model out of the other 26\" televisions because it was the only 26\" television that actually had a vertical viewing angle. The pictures on the rest of the 26\" televisions turn white when viewed from above and turn purple and green when viewed from below. This Sony model does not have this problem.The picture is great for an LCD. There are settings to improve the levels of black and white. Picture from the component connections look good. Analog channels have a bit of static in some colors.EDITI can confirm with another reviewer that a 1080i source over HDMI produces a line of static at the top of the screen. This does not happen if either the source is 720p over HDMI or 1080i over component. A 1080p source results in an \"Unknown Format\" error.The television's audio is good when it's loud, but not good when it is set low. My television had a low-volume hiss in the built-in speakers and is noticeable in low volume levels. There are stereo RCA and digital coaxial audio outputs for external speakers.This television forces the user to run a 30+ minute auto program to detect all of the channels. There is no way to manually add or remove channels from the television without running the auto programmer first. Thankfully, the auto programmer found all of the analog and clear unscrambled cable channels and didn't add any scrambled channels.The biggest turnoff of this television is its selling price. Depending on the sales price, you can get a low-to-mid range 32\" HDTV for the same price.If you just care about screen size, then those 32\" HDTVs might be for you. If you want quality for about the same price and don't mind a smaller size, check out this Sony while shopping around. It's not the best TV out there, but it's in the top five of 26\" HDTVs out there.edit: if you do get this model or any other Sony LCD television, immediately shut off \"Noise Reduction\" in the Advanced Options of the Picture menu.

Colors look sharp and crisp, and I noticed no lag even in the most action-packed scenes. High Def pops off the screen. I found the sound quality for the most part to be excellent. I sit approximately 4 feet from the tv and i never turned the sound above 10, which seemed to be less than a quarter of the way up. Bass, however, was lacking. Not such a terrible thing, considering the wealth of inputs this baby has. What was the deal breaker, however, was an annoying \"auto-dim\" feature that is not advertised and there is no way to turn it off, even through the hidden service menu. This \"feature\" kicks in whenever it encounters a screen that is black or mostly black, and will \"dim\" the TV even more. It's like someone slapped a pair of blu-blockers on you. As soon as some color presents itself, the display pops right back to normal, but as a gaming nerd whose taste in games lie toward the type where lots of dark alleys/sewer pipes present themselves, this would not do. I did everything in my power to try to get this issue resolved myself because I fell in love with the TV on all other counts. If you're thinking about buying a sony, I would go to a retail establishment, make them hook a dvd player up and pop in a dvd of \"24\". If the auto-dim kicks in on the opening credits before the yellow \"24\" appears, BEWARE. Check to see if there is a menu option to disable it. On a final note, Sony's customer service was friendly, if not helpful. I used the \"chat with rep live\" feature and it became apparent immediately the rep didn't understand the problem.

When it was opened and plugged in it did not work, this is almost unheard of for TV's now days. When I called Sony support I was told I could receive a rebuilt TV or have a repairman sent to the house because it had exceeded 30 days. Because I did not open a Xmas present early (bought in Nov) and set it up to check it out, support acted like it was my fault. To be offered a rebuilt TV in place of a new replacement upset me and I told her if I had to have one rebuilt then the one I have should be fixed. An appointment was made for the next day and my wife stayed home all day to wait for the repairman. He was supposed to show between 800-1300, he never showed. He called later to say he didn't see the message and when my wife told him what the TV was doing he said he would call back. He called back and said it was not \"Cost effective\" for him to come and repair the TV. Sony would have to send a rebuilt one. My wife (her Xmas present) is not happy with this result and neither am I. Having just bought $4000 + in Sony electronics this Xmas I don't feel like I received a quality product for my money and cannot recommend their products to anyone I come in contact with.

There is a better control over picture display, display options, as well as a lot of convenient features like \"live color\" (I believe that's what it's called) which automatically adjusts colors to make flesh tones appear more accurate, and some kind of \"smart sound\" feature (which I'm not sure Sony's name for) which adjusts the level of the volume so commercials don't blast when you're watching a tv show--which is particularly helpful if you're an insomniac like me and other people are sleeping. It also has an ambient light sensor for the backlight, which is truly missed now that I have the L series. The sound is superior on the M series as well. The menus and layout are just better, on the M series.  It should be noted there is no headphone jack on the L series.  This is not an issue for most people I would imagine, but if you watch tv late at night, or if you use an RCA to miniplug (headphone jack needed) connection for speakers, you are sort of out of luck.  (There is however, an RCA connection for additional audio input like speakers.)The L series seems to be calibrated differently visually and otherwise, but with some fiddling around I was able to get an accurate image (colors, sharpness, etc.) (For instance, I generally prefer warm on color temperature settings, but on the L series, it's too warm, so I go with neutral and adjust the hue manually.I don't have the technical details for both tvs, but I do know they are both 720p and will output from inputs (like hdmi blu-ray players, etc.) in 1080i. response time, contrast ration, etc. seem to be comparable, though I don't have the exact technical specifications.the other main difference is cosmetic, the M series is a piano black finish (popular nowadays) and the L series is a matte finish (which I personally prefer) and it should be noted that they space at the bottom as in the picture is indeed translusent and that is also where you're indicator lights are.these are just a few of my observations from trying both models out. ultimately, the M series is a step up and it's if it's similar in price, you may want to consider it. But if you prefer the larger screen size at a cheaper price (though prices fluctuate) and the matte finish of the exterior of the tv, i would say go with the L series.I give the L series four stars, and the M series 5 stars, but they are both excellent choices.***Edit:  After spending more time with the L-series I am still very pleased, particularly getting great quality at a bargain price.  (If you compare other brands in this price range, this Sony blows them out of the water, though for a comparable price, I think the Samsung 32\" might surpass this one--though I generally prefer Sony.  Do keep in mind that the L-series is the bargain model, M-series is still bargain, but the picture quality IS better, and the XBR and S-series (not sure if S-series is still being made) is better than that.  For me, having the 32\" screen versus the 26\" was worth the sacrifice in image quality.  It's true what they say, I've found, (they being consumer buying guides), often when faced between two sizes, the larger one is the one most people wish they'd bought once they get home with it.  Both are excellent choices though.***", "Date": "December 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Warning with interference on cable and satellite boxes, and annoying popping noise", "Author": "V.

Sound is fine, except for an annoying popping noise when I change channels on a Comcast HD box.  I ran into another problem, though. The TV was not allowing my Comcast HD box to function in the dark. Since this was in my bedroom, when the lights were turned off and the TV was the only thing on, the cable box stopped working. Did not have this problem during the daytime or when the lights were on. Both Sony and Comcast were of no use. So I Googled, and found out that the newer LCD TVs of many name brands, emit some form of IR (infared) interference, thereby killing the cable box reception from its remote. If you Google \"LCD TV IR interference\", it will shock you. And the TV and cable companies won't talk about it.Luckily, I found a solution for this problem in the TV's menu settings. Go to Picture/Advanced Settings/Light Sensor, and turn off the light sensor. This light sensor automatically changes the picture brightness based on the light in the room. It killed the Comcast box IR at night, which explains why it worked with the lights on or during the day. After I turned it off, the cable box worked like a charm in the dark.Update 4-28-09:I got sick of the loud popping noises on the HDMI inputs. I know this is a problem, as I have read about it before. I called Sony and they wanted me to send it for repair, or possibly exchange for refurb unit. I now went to component RGB inputs to eliminate the popping noise. At this point, it's a 3 star.

The picture quality is great, even though it could use a few more picture settings to tweak the image more to your liking. Unfortunately, it has an auto-dim feature that basically changes the contrast and backlight settings automatically depending on how much black there is on the screen. It makes dark scenes very dark and bright scenes very bright. Since I couldn't find a way to disable it, I spoke to a Sony tech online who told me that what was doing that was the ACE contrast enhancement feature and that there was no way to change it.This was definitely a deal breaker for me. If you only watch movies or play games with no dark scenery at all, you probably won't be annoyed too much. For anyone else, I'd suggest checking it out yourself before you buy. As gamer, it was just impossible to deal with. For example, if you play a game like Dead Space on it, the ACE pretty much makes the game unplayable since it darkens everything so much that you can barely make out what's on the screen.Needless to say I returned it after a few days of frustration and ended up buying a 37\" Toshiba Regza for just around a hundred dollars more and am very happy with it. The Regza actually has a similar feature but you can change its setting from low to high or disable it completely if you wish.

To our surprise, after 10 months, the picture went bad.  Fortunately, there was a 1 year warranty with the TV.  My mother was easily able to access the Sony warranty people on the phone who arranged for her to receive the exact same model BUT one that was refurbished.  This \"new\" refurbished TV came with only a 90 day warranty as opposed to the one year warranty on the new TV I originally purchased.  This refurbished TV went bad after just a few weeks.  At that point, Sony offered my mother a 32\" inch \"new\" TV for an additional $400.  That was ridiculous as this price, plus the original paid for the malfunctioning 26\", would mean that we paid over $900 for a 32\" TV that costs $599 today new on Amazon.  So my mother requested that she simply receive a new 26\" TV to replace the original purchase that went bad within the warranty period.  They said all they can do is give her another refurbished 26\" TV with a 90 day warranty.  So basically, our new TV with a year warranty has been reduced to a refurbished TV with a 90 day warranty.  In addition, my mother has spent many days without a working TV.

The KDL-26M4000 is one of the best featured Sony television sets to date. I purchased this model from Amazon.com at the beginning of 2009, few months before the digital broadcasting switch. At the same time I switched from cable subscription to the over-the-air antenna. As such, this Sony TV set model has behaved flawlessly. To overcome the weak sound issue, I hooked a wireless headphones set and/or a simple and affordable stereo set of speakers with great success.The only important trouble coming to this (and maybe other Sony Bravia models) set is when one scans or re-scans for broadcast channels: during or after completion of scanning, the TV set is freezing to the point where no options buttons will respond.I did freaked out thinking: that's it! I am without TV now. Went outside took a walk, trying to figure it out: My room antenna is routed via the DVD player into the TV set. The DVD has a broadcast receiver of its own, my Sony Bravia KDL-26M4000 model has its own too. Might be the reception signal is messed up?Returned home, unplugged the TV from the electric wall outlet. Removed the antenna cable from the DVD, and hooked it directly in the back of the TV. Plugged back the TV power cord, started the TV and ohhh! It worked.Lesson learned: Next time I scan for new TV channels, use the antenna cable plugged directly into the TV...The Sony TV booklet does not list this issue in the troubleshooting section, maybe they did not know how a customer will wire their TV set, at the time the booklet was printed-out.Still a very happy with my Sony Bravia KDL-26M4000 set.

Out of curiosity I decided to look it up on here. I was reading this one and two star reviews and I am baffled. It's worked just fine for us. Great in fact. No problems with it...or hardly any. The sound is fine, plenty loud even too loud at times. My one and only complaint is that we recently noticed this weird dark line towards the center of the screen. It appeared when my husband was trying to fix the picture so it fit the screen. A problem I blame on my cable not my TV as it started (the picture not fitting) after I had an issue with my cable box and rebooted it. Then suddenly the picture wasn't fitting, there was dark, empty space all around. Well my husband came home recently and decided on a lark to attempt to fix it. With some messing around with the TV's settings (and I did a little messing with the cable's screen settings to allow the closed captioning I use to fit) he got the picture to fit now. But now there's this mysterious dark line in the middle of the screen. If it weren't for that I would've easily given this 5 stars. I love my Sony. In fact, the reason my husband decided to mess with the settings in the first place is our 'big screen' (42\" LG Plasma bought in 2006) died on us on the Saturday night before the Superbowl (02/05/2011). We were watching TV and we heard a \"Pop\" and the picture simply went away. Leaving us to watch the game on the 26\" Sony in the bedroom. This is, for now, our only TV and I think it works great.
