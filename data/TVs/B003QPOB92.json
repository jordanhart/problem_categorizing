{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Impressive TV!", "Author": "AF", "ReviewID": "RHS7ZK3P932W3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Sharp TV ever! I am totally impressed & very pleased with the purchase. The color quality, picture clarity & the fine picture details exhibited on the set are fantastic; the colors are rich & pop out at you. The backlighting provides for either a very bright screen or the option to tone it down, it's your call (I keep the set on `auto view' which allows the TV to automatically adjust to the day & night room lighting). There are other picture settings such as `standard', `user' & `dynamic' modes just to name a few. The features & adjustments to picture color & quality are enormous. I used the `Disney WOW' calibration disk to optimize the settings which worked out very well.The sound the TV produces is also very good; an external sound system would just be an added plus. You have the option of either connecting through the `digital audio output (optical) or through the `audio out' terminal. I have not had the chance to try the 3D yet, however, I am not too concerned about that. I purchased the set primarily for 2D; the 3D is just an added plus. Interestingly, the set can convert regular 2D format to 3D format which is a great built in option to have. In addition, 2 pairs of active 3D glasses are included with the set.The design is sleek & striking, stands out when compared to some of the other manufacturer models I have seen. Note: This TV has a full glass panel covering the LED panel which can show reflections depending on the layout, lighting & windows of your room. The glass panel also adds to its weight, have someone help you when setting up the TV.Internet capability is great, experienced no problems with any of the applications. I have it hard wired but the TV also comes with a wireless connection. Netflix & Vudu work flawlessly! No hang ups at all. As far as firmware updates, Sharp automatically provides updates on line. Shortly after I had completed setup I received a message on the screen advising of a firmware update. Sharp will also add 3 extra months to the 12 month warranty service when you register on line for the Sharp Aquos Advantage for a total of 15 months coverage.When conducting my research on this set I could not find reviews by any of the major electronics publications such as CNET or Consumer Reports. However, I was able to find an ample number of customer reviews on this model which were positive & praised the TV's picture quality, features and characteristics. There were even some reviews on YouTube. That was all I needed to know! Between all of the positive customer reviews, the set's features, styling & price, my decision to purchase this set was reinforced.I was also pleasantly surprised to find the absence of backlight bleed, uneven backlighting and or clouding issues on the panel, in particular on very dark scenes in a darken room. This was one of my major concerns because my previous set, the Toshiba 55wx800u (which I returned) had significant backlight and clouding issues in spite of being a great performer. From my research, backlight bleed, uneven backlighting and clouding are inherent on many LED models made by the leading manufacturers, some are worse than others.All in all, this is a great TV!", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "4.5 / 5 Stars - Only gripe is reflective screen", "Author": "Dkeat \"last.fm/label/Indepent+Artist\"", "ReviewID": "R3ASMC4E6XCR0E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this tv set off of the warehouse deals section on Amazon.com for $765. It did not come with glasses or a wireless adapter (I think this tv normally comes with one). It also had scuffs/crack on the frame of the screen but did not mess with the picture at all.I am very impressed with the picture quality and available picture settings. I mainly use the 'Standard' picture option which looks like it adjusts based on what is being broadcast on the screen. The game mode works great for when playing games on the PS3. This is my first experience with 3D so I'm no expert but I thought it looked great. Found a pair of 'universal' 3d glasses for around $65 [...] that worked with this set and the only downside I found is that they aren't rechargeable.TV came with VUDU and Netflix built-in. I don't believe it is wireless, or maybe you need an adapter but I just ran an ethernet cable from my router directly into the tv and it works fine. Note, Netflix on this set is limited to your instant queue so you can't browse for movies/shows in Netflix on this tv. You'd have to pull up Netflix on your computer and add movies/shows to your queue there and then you would be able to access them from your queue on the tv.I would give this tv 5/5 but it does have that glass-like reflective screen. If you're watching a dark scene, you will be able to see reflections. For the picture quality, features and applications though, it was an easy decision to keep this tv.Refresh rate can go up to 240 'aquamotion' or something like that. The colors are really great. I did a lot of reading on edge-lit, back-lit, blooming, all that stuff that LEDs are about and I can tell you I have not noticed anything like that. Response time is not a problem with gaming since the game mode works as it should.There is no rush to get a 3D tv yet though as the content out there is limited and still expensive. 3D movies are usually around $30 so your best bet is to buy a 3D video game (Uncharted 3 looked great) or rent from Vudu (around $5.99 for the 1080p rental).", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,999.99", "Features": "Shipment - With Stand 76 lbs", "Name": "Sharp LC52LE925UN 52-inch Aquos Quattron LED-LCD 3D-Compatible HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Bf2Xt7FDL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003QPOB92"}}
