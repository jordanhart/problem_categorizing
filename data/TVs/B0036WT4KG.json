{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WOW. Amazing LED set!!", "Author": "F. Fernandez \"BrokenFern\"", "ReviewID": "R2MM22GBMWTNRX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I want to be clear about the kind of review this is intended to be. I am not a profession TV rater. I am not a videophile. I am a regular Joe and I am reviewing this for the regular Joe who is thinking about spending more than usual on a good quality television. During the next few months, I'm sure you can find a more professional review from the usual places... But for now, this is my impressions.CORNER LIGHT: After reading many reviews on last years B8000 and this year's C7000, I was worried about the light that emits from the corners. I've seen displays of last year's B8000 and this year's C7000 and have VERY easily seen what people are talking about. I took a big gamble in purchasing this TV before I read if people were having issues with this C8000. So let me say... After watching this TV for about 5 hours per day for 3 days... I have NOT seen the light coming from the edges as seen on other sets. And believe me I've been looking. I tried to find it watching the HD feed on Time Warner Cable, Blu-ray's from the PS3, Blu-Ray's from the Samsung 3D Blu-Ray player, watching at night, during the day... Nothing. I just do not see it!LOOKS: This TV looks just amazing. It has a VERY dark black screen. It looks as beautiful turned off as it does on. I was nervous about the brush metal look, but it actually looks very nice and compliments the new chromed four-legged stand.PICTURE: The picture clarity looks incredible. It's as if I'm discovering HD for the first time. This set replaces a Samsung DLP set, so of course this is a vast improvement. Having said that, I have a newer plasma in the bedroom and this set looks much better than that. As with all new LED sets with 240 Hz, there is a bit of the Spanish Soap Opera/Home Video look to it. Some people really like this, some people don't. I really like it. For those of you that don't, you can always turn this feature down or off. To me this makes the picture look very clear and it makes it stand out from the other sets.3D: Along with this TV I purchased the Samsung 3D Bluray player so I can get the 3D startup kit for free. Turning the 3D feature on and connecting the glasses was easy. The intro to Monsters v. Aliens was very cool. The opening scene in outer space looked incredible. The ball tied to a paddle part was funny and kinda made me jump a little. I haven't spent too much time with 3D but I did notice that there were some scenes in the movie that had a double image while wearing the glasses. It doesn't happen a lot, but it is noticeable. You can see this right away during the church scene at the beginning of the movie. It was a little annoying. I'm hoping that this is the kind of stuff that gets ironed out with a firmwear update, or as more content is released, they learn to fix it.OnlineTV: This is also a very new area for me. I never understood the need for me to want apps on my TV... But its actually kina cool. I've tried a few apps but my favorite by far is the Pandora app. I'm a big fan of  Pandora and this app I actually like better on my TV than online or the iPhone. The only thing I hate is that Samsung did not have Wifi built in. I think pricing this set at the $3000+ mark should be enough to include it with the set and not require me to drop another $80 for the USB adapter. I just hardwired it, but that's another wire I don't like dealing with.USB: I wanted to mention that this set allows you to connect a USB external hard drive and play music, photo's and movies directly from the HDD. I have a Western Digital 320GB Passport filled with movies and music, and I was able to navigate the files structure in the drive using the remote quite easily. And it played all the files formats I threw at it.Pros:No corner light!!!Very dark screen.Very clear picturePandora Samsung App3D was surprisingly funUSB external HDD capableand... NO CORNER LIGHT!Cons:Slight double images on 3D.Wifi requires an $80 USB adaptor.Overall I am very satisfied with the UN55C8000. Even with the few CONS, this set to this average Joe is a definite 5 star! As I spend more time with the set, I'll be sure to update this review if I find something worth mentioning. Please feel free to ask me questions and I'll try my best to answer them. I know how nerve wrecking buying a big ticket item such as this is... So I would be glad to help as much as I can.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good First Step into Full HD 3D, But Not Perfect", "Author": "Chris Boylan \"MrBoylan\"", "ReviewID": "R1FARUBQBBM947", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Samsung's UN55C8000 LED TV (LED backlit LCD) represents a good first step in full HD 3D technology, but it's definitely not without its flaws.Drawbacks:* High price* Problems handling 24 frame/second material (movies)* Mixed results with upconversion of standard def material to HD* Some crosstalk on native and upconverted 3D content* Some lighting uniformity issues (compared to best plasma and local-dimming sets)Pros:* Nice black levels and shadow detail for a super-thin (under 1-inch) edge-lit LED set* Bright, accurate colors* Energy efficient* Excellent 3D effect with native 3D content* Decent 3D upconversion of 2D content (varies based on content)* Extremely robust selection of IPTV content (web-based widgets, audio and video streaming)As for price, yes this is one of the first full HD 3D TVs on the market, so you can expect to pay a premium, but $3500 (list) is a lot to pay for a 55-inch TV.  Panasonic's comparably sized and featured 54-inch 3D VT25 plasma lists for $500 less.  Even Samsung's own 3D-capable 46-inch LCD set (standard CCFL backlighting), the LN46C750 sells for about half the price of this LED-lit model.  At $1799 list, the 46-inch 3D LCD is only slightly more expensive than comparably sized, comparably featured 2D models.For SD upconversion, the C8000 does well with the standard \"jaggies\" tests and 2:3 cadence detection in its \"Auto 1\" mode, but it falls apart with mixed content (video titles on a film background), creating combing/tearing artifacts on the screen unless you go out of your way to change the mode setting to \"Auto 2\" mode.  A good video processor should be able to accomodate both types of content without the user having to go deep into the set-up menus.The C8000's 3D feature is both a pro and a con.  On native 3D content, such as the \"Monster Vs. Aliens\" on Blu-ray 3D as well as some test patterns we had on a USB stick, the set's illusion of depth and dimensionality is impressive -- as good if not better than the 3D effect seen in most theaters.  And we found that it maintained the 3D effect even from 25 feet away and from well off-axis (watching TV from the side of the room, instead of directly in front of it).  Yes, there are times when you can get some crosstalk (left eye image visible by the right eye, which leads to ghosting), but this is fairly sporadic and generally isn't so obtrusive as to minimize one's enjoyment of the movie.  Samsung added a setting in the 1016.0 firmware that allows you to adjust the 3D mode to minimize crosstalk and this does help, though even with the feature enabled, there can still be some crosstalk at times.  Also, Samsung offers a real-time 2D to 3D conversion feature which is more effective than we expected and can give you some additional depth and 3D qualities on existing content.  It's particularly effective on vector-based animation and games, but even on theatrical titles such as \"Star Trek\" and \"Avatar\" on 2D Blu-ray Disc, certain scenes do take on a pleasant (though mild) sense of depth.Back in 2D mode, we did notice one unexpected issue with the C8000's handling of 24p content (24 frames/second) from standard Blu-ray Discs.  Previous Samsung models had the ability to apply motion interpolation (Samsung's \"Auto Motion Plus\" feature) for video-based content independently from film content.  The separate settings for \"Judder Reduction\" (film) and \"Blur Reduction\" (video) worked independently.  This allows the user to apply motion interpolation to video sources, like live sports and concert videos, minimizing screen blur and smooting out the motion, while still presenting movies in a native 24p mode that preserves that \"filmic feel\" that many movie-lovers prefer.  In the C8000 model, even with Judder Reduction OFF (set to 0) in \"Custom\" mode, there is still some motion interpolation going on, which causes movies to look a little more like video (called by some the \"soap opera effect\").  Hopefully this is a problem that can be fixed via firmware but as of the time of this review, that is not yet available. [update: this issue has been confirmed by Samsung QA and engineering]As an edge-lit set, there are also some issues with picture uniformity.  When you're lighting up an entire set with just a string of LED lights along the edges, there's only so far that a diffusor panel can go to get a nice uniform backlight.  Samsung has improved this over last year's edge-lit models, through the use of a technique called \"Precision Dimming.\"  With Precision Dimming, areas of the lighting assembly can be turned off or dimmed independently of other areas.  So instead of having one big bright backlight, with only the LCD shutters to provide darkness, the TV can selectively dim parts of the screen (like the top and bottom letterbox areas of 2.35:1 and 2.4:1 movies).  This leads to less hot-spotting around the edges, and better overall black levels.  It's not quite as effective as full local dimming with a \"full array\" LED backlight, but it's better than having no local dimming technology.  Combined with the 2010 improvements in the LCD panel itself, the uniformity and black level performance of the new sets is getting closer to a plasma or full array LED/LCD set with local dimming.  Next year, they'll probably get even better.Color reproduction of the C8000 is excellent, with saturation near the performance of the best plasmas (and this color and grey scale accuracy holds up even in the dimmer 3D mode), so no real complaints there, but the colors don't quite \"pop\" as much as they do on local dimming LED and plasma sets as the level of the blacks is not quite as deep as those other technologies.In terms of the internet streaming and IPTV content, again, no complaints here: with VUDU, Blockbuster VOD, Netflix streaming, Pandora internet radio, and Yahoo widgets, etc., as well as DLNA compatibility, the C8000 TV brings a wealth of content to your TV from your home network and from the internet at large.  One might imagine that over time these services will also be helpful in providing native 3D content which for now is extremely hard to come by.Overall, there is a lot to like about the C8000, but it does suffer from a few first generation issues.  If the high price and relatively minor issues with 2D upconversion and occasional 3D crosstalk don't worry you too much, then it's definitely worth a look.  But there's also something to be said for waiting to see what they come up with next year when more content is available and some of these early issues have been worked out.  It's also possible that some of these issues may be improved with firmware updates, so early adopters may still benefit from enhancements as time goes on.Our complete review of the UN55C8000 is available on Big Picture big Sound (dot com).", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hands down best bang for the buck!", "Author": "Jigsore", "ReviewID": "R1HHZK7TG4TWGE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I do own this TV, and it is replacing the c7000 model. About a month ago I walked into a local retailer and asked when the 3D sets were coming out, to my surprise they had just received the first shipment of C7000 3D ready sets from Samsung. After spending about a half an hour checking out the TV, and asking a lot of questions I decided to take the plunge and purchase the TV, 3D Blu-Ray player, and starter kit. My intentions were not to buy a new set that day, but it was getting to be time to upgrade anyway so I wanted to have something with some \"wow factor\" for a while. A friend and I loaded up the set and got the connections made, cracked a couple of beers and checked out my new investment. There were mixed reactions to say the least. Once the novelty of the 3D wears off you can be really critical of that model. Huge amount of \"crosstalk\" on the picture, and cloudy bright spots with \"flashlighting\" in the bottom two corners. Very disappointing. I went back to the store to look at the display model again and did not see a fraction of the issues that my set was showing. The salesperson said that the Panasonic Plasma should be coming in any day and they expected it to be light years ahead of the Samsung in picture quality, black level, no crosstalk, etc.After a week or so I went in to see the Panasonic that was now also on display only to see the same issues with crosstalk in 3D. The 2D experience on the Panasonic was quite good but at the time the only size available was 50\", and I was replacing a 62\" set and really didn't want to make that drastic of a change. So on bright pictures the Samsung was absolutely stunning! In a dark room while watching a dark movie the picture was just unacceptable for a TV in this price range. At this point I figured that I would return the TV, and wait for one of the larger Panasonic's to hit the stores.Then I saw that the C8000 was being released earlier than expected, and had new technology called Pinpoint Dimming. After doing quite a bit of reading reviews, and others' experience with the Samsung locally dimmed set's I decided to give Samsung another chance before going to Plasma.  Amazon had the TV for sale before my local retailer so I placed the order and crossed my fingers that I would not be returning two new TV's instead of one. Well let me wrap this up by saying that I am sooooo glad that I made this choice! The C8000 is absolutely stunning in aesthetic quality, and is the best picture quality I have probably ever seen! Dare I say it is even better than the 8500 from last year that gets such great reviews. There is no flashlighting, the black levels are completely pitch black, and as another reviewer already stated, once you get the picture dialed in the way you like it there really is no comparison. Everyone that sees the TV in my house has to stop and watch for a while, in fact, the downside to owning it is that I can't get people to go home!Now with that being said, there are some minor observations that would be different in a perfect world. If you put this set in a large room and watch it from a large angle you will lose some of the black levels, and for the price it really should have wifi built in. Also, in the menu's it seems that some settings should be grouped together under the headings, so you have to jump around in the menu's a bit to get your set dialed in, but this is typically not something you will be doing all the time.  Other than that I really can't see a problem with it. When considering the C7000 or C8000 do yourself a favor and choose the latter. Even if this set was hundreds of dollars more it would be worth it. This one will be hard to beat.UPDATE: After having the TV for about a week it started having some technical issues like switching sources randomly, and changing the picture settings for no reason. Samsung tech support was very good and we thought initially the problems were being caused by the Logitech remote I use, however after increased tech issues the TV had to be returned. Being that the picture quality is so exceptional on this set I have already replaced it with another one of the same model purchased at retail (for much less money actually) and am keeping my fingers crossed that this one does not have any technical issues. I am leaving my review at five stars simply because every so often you can get a bum product, or something could have happened during shipping, but have to say that Samsung, and Amazon have been really great about taking care of me on this, and the picture quality really is very good. Reading the other reviews I am surprised that anyone would not give this a five star rating. When replacing my C8000 I checked out one of the last B8500's still available, and side by side I have to say that not only me, but most people in the store were more impressed with the C8000.  By the way, I have owned several products that C-net gave very high ratings that I had no success with, and vice versa, so I really think it comes down to your own expectations on a purchase like this.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality, poor quality control", "Author": "William S. Dubel", "ReviewID": "R3S1V01NZSJQ9G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Picture quality is excellent. Black isn't perfect but better than any LCD I've seen. Clouding is not an issue, and I don't have a \"flashlighting\" problem. I compared last years 8500 and this years C8000 in store before purchasing; C8000 had better PQ IMHO in store, and I'd take the lack of blooming on the C8000 over the potentially better blacks on the 8500. I gave up on Anynet and purchased a Harmony remote. Too bad Samsung firmware doesn't let you set the \"default\" input to be HDMI (Another device turning off changes TV input to Coax using HDMI-CEC). A little customization would go a long way in making Anynet usable. I really wish the Game Mode setting had a discrete remote code, or at least wasn't buried 10+ steps into the menu. I am not crazy about the silver bezel; wish it was dark grey or black, but it is a step up for Piano Gloss Black for me which really shows prints and looks tacky to me even without prints.My TV is in a pretty bright room. Looks almost perfect for how I watch it, night or day, though admittedly at night I can detect a tiny amount of non-uniformity in very isolated dark scenes and a small amount of flashlighting with letterbox scenes. At the end of the day, this is the best TV picture quality I have personally seen to date, regardless of technology or price.The settings I changed from the default:Mode: StandardBacklight: 12Contrast: 90AMP: ClearEco Mode: On (Great feature, otherwise TV is too bright at night)-Lowest Backlight: 7My Personal Ratings:Picture Quality during day: 9/10 - glossy screen, perfect otherwisePicture Quality at night: 9/10 - minor lighting uniformity issues or 'clouding'Picture Quality compared to Plasma - Sharper, Brighter (way more awesome) in direct view, but move more than 20 degrees off center and Plasma wins, except in a bright roomRemote control: 3/10 - Its back-lit and looks cool, but usability is horrible. Get a Harmony.Bezel/Stand/Form: 5/10 - Don't like plastic trim and silver bezel, but still looks better than most of the competition. Don't like the panel buttons. Stand is ugly. Hate proprietary dongles (for network, cable connections, etc) would prefer .2\" thicker to get real connectors on the back (Doesn't the C6500 have real connectors?). Do appreciate the fact that the connectors run along the TV instead of straight out the back (very nice!). Do not like the permanently affixed power cord. TV should have a physical power button accessible on the back.Quality Control: 5/10 - I'm just waiting for the capacitors to fail now. I'm not feeling good about the amount of people receiving possessed TVs. See below.Average my ratings except quality control (and the easily replaced remote) and I would give this set 4 out of 5 stars. It's good, but significant room for improvement on a high end consumer TV.Unfortunately, the Samsung UN55C8000 looses another precious star since the original TV Amazon replaced for me had a serious problem:Each morning watching satellite, within about 15 minutes of powering on (and remotes hidden away), TV changes input to PC/Cable, static appears in the back, lower right red indicator is flashing quickly (as if remote is sending commands) and TV is unresponsive to front panel buttons and most remote buttons. I was able to get the input back to HDMI by pressing Menu on the remote, but took repeated tries. To bring the TV back to normal, I had to physically disconnect power cable from the wall (very annoying) as the regular power button doesn't work.Mine became possessed with CEC (Anynet) turned on or off. With Anynet control connection enabled on the receiver, it switched my receiver to another input and turned it off. As a test when TV was possessed I disconnected the only cable (HDMI) connected to the TV to see if that helped it recover. The TV remained unresponsive to the remote/front panel and continued to flash the red indicator as if it was receiving commands. Based on this and that the replacement under the same setup does not go crazy, the errant commands were not coming off of HDMI-CEC.Once I was able to get the TV out of the unresponsive flashy mode by pressing buttons on the front panel. Another time, the TV rebooted on its own, but cleared ALL of my settings and came up in demo mode (which I exited through the normal plug and play menu setting). Having seen demo mode, I can determine that what the TV was doing before the reboot was certainly not demo mode.I believe the control board in the Samsung is likely faulty, and since only a few others see this maybe be a yield issue in the Tijuana factory. Maybe it is temperature related, my house is a few degrees cooler in the morning. As the TV warms up an improperly soldered chip makes complete contact and confuses the remote sensor. Maybe its a grounding issue (loose connection).Technical details:Tested with firmware 1006, 1016, 1017.Yamaha RX-V765 AVR connected by HDMI to TV. Tried with HDMI control on and off, no difference.PS3 (HDMI), Dish Network PIV 722 (HDMI), and PS2 (component) connected to AVROther than the single HDMI connection from AVR and power cable through basic surge protector, no other connections to TV.I called Samsung and they say something is definitely wrong with my TV, that its not something previously reported to them, even though you can search the forums online and you will find others with the same issue. They offered to schedule service but I decided to just exchange with Amazon. Frustrating because its not easily reproducible. The rep said if possible a video of the TV \"doing its thing\" might be useful for a service tech. I have caught it going crazy on video several times.Since I worry some other defect like this might be exposed down the road, I purchased the 4 year warranty. I haven't purchased one before, but this issue is not a good indication of the acceptable failure rates from Samsung (or possibly any consumer goods, expensive or not). It is ironic because LED technology is more reliable/robust than CCFL, but I suppose a product is only as reliable as your weakest link, in this case, Samsung manufacturing quality.I have had my replacement C8000 for a month now, and it hasn't become possessed once. Since I was seeing the issue on my old one almost every day, I am pretty sure there is some issue these TVs are prone to right out of the factory. So for the few of you having this issue (maybe less than 0.1% of all C8000/C7000 owners?), I suggest you get your TV replaced. I suppose if you have an absolutely perfect panel (no dead red subpixels or massive clouding), you might opt for the motherboard swap.Both sets I received have a red subpixel stuck black, in different locations. Since its hard to find without a solid red screen, I'm guessing its pretty normal to have this on these displays (though never had one in all the other LCD computer displays I have personally owned). I am curious how many have tried with the solid red image, and not found a dead subpixel. Disappointing, but not a deal breaker.Yes, Samsung and Amazon ensured I would get a working TV, but overall this 5 star TV loses a star for typical design/value issues and another star for being defective - 3 stars! Picture quality really is so fantastic it is a shame to give it 3 stars, but I'd be lying to myself if I didn't say my overall experience wasn't disappointing.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice but not exceptional TV", "Author": "Wildcat Guy", "ReviewID": "R3V748EJWPEKWP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am revising a review I submitted the first week I had this HDTV.  I definitely have mixed feelings after having the un55c8000 for almost a month.  There is alot to like, and several things that are very frustrating about this HDTV.  At the end of the day, I returned it to Amazon and purchased the Samsung plasma 58c8000.  In any event, I got this set, the c6900 Sammy bluray and 3d starter kit for a phenomenal price in late March from Amazon (much lower than it is going for in late April 2010 now).ProsGreat picture on the right settings - I fooled around with the settings for 3 weeks before finding the right mix.  This set has a lot of options on settings and you can end up with a totally different looking TV if the settings are poor.  The best I could come up with was to switch to Standard, Color 45-50, Tint 45/55, Backlight 12-14, Brightness 45, Sharpness 0 (this is important) and switch almost all the other settings off except for Smart LED to med/high, Motion Plus to Custom with 10 blur/2 judder, Mode Auto2, and Natural.Nice stand and titanium bezel.  Good look.Remote is very nice compared to the bluray remote, but I'm using a Harmony 900 for all my components so it isn't used.Bright screen compared to plasmas I've had.  Blur settings above enable you to enjoy sports without the \"soap opera\" effect but there are some issues watching movies (see below).Pinpoint dimming works.  No flashlighting like the c7000 series I've witnessed.Real 3D content (Monsters v. Aliens) looks great (even with a 1.3 highspeed HDMI cable -- however, 2D to 3D conversion of regular programs gives only nice depth - not pop out 3d.Super thin TV - fairly lightweight.Netflix app works through both through the TV and the bluray and surprisingly has good pic quality - not bluray like, but close to DVD quality with no glitches (assuming you have a fast internet connection). Software upgrade worked well for bluray and TV to update netflix and the other internet apps (just not the firmware update to the TV itself) through wifi.ConsLots of screen glare in a bright room (although offset by bright picture).  This TV does not have a traditional matte screen like many LCD HDTVs.  It is a VERY shiny screen, and the reflections look somewhat warped - like the screen is not uniform.  It is not noticeable during normal watching, but with the TV off or in very dark scenes, the reflections are bowed.Narrow viewing angle - if you're off center by more than 5 feet you lose blacks.  This is a major problem unless all of your seating is directly in front of the TV.TV isn't wifi - need a $80 adapter or have to hardwire it - TV firmware didn't update through the adapter - had to update on Samsung site with USB.The pinpoint dimming works - to a point.  This TV does not have the flashlights in the corners of the screen like its sister TV, the c7000.  However, it does have \"clouding\" in dark scenes where you see a glow of of light around bright words/objects where the rest of the screen is dark.  This is very noticeable in credits in movies but not discernable in everyday watching of normal TV shows.My biggest beef with this TV is that you pay for the 240hz auto motion plus to make this TV more \"plasma-like\" for purposes of motion blur.  However, the auto motion plus makes most movies look too \"soap opera-ee\" while making live sports look incredible.  So, you are constantly fooling around with the settings every time you change the channel.Another issue with the TV is something that another reviewer spent a great deal of time on, and that is the jerkiness/judder of movies.  While most movies on bluray, directv and dvd look phenomenal most of the time, about every 10 min or so, you will see a jerky scene - lasts about 2-3 seconds, that appears unnatural.  Then the movie just continues looking great.  10 minutes later you see it again.  I've read that if you turn off the judder and auto motion plus, this may fix the problem, but again, then you have to switch all your settings every time you switch between sports and movies.  A bit high maintenance . . .In all, the picture quality with the right settings on this TV is great.  The problem is that it is too much work to constantly change your settings depending on what you're watching. Also, the off angle viewing issue, clouding and bowed screen are a turnoff.  If these issues were fixed, this TV would be unbeatable.  Unfortunately, I ended up frustrated by the potential of the TV that isn't quite there yet.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung Customer Service Sucks", "Author": "oanrai \"Hank\"", "ReviewID": "R19ALMM320ZGLF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This television probably rocks, during the short 5 hours it worked it was superb.  And then it just quit.  So I contacted Samsung 'customer service', and the games began.  Caveat Emptor, Samsung CS is not your friend.  The set was installed on 6/28, and died on the morning of 6/29.  Notified Samsung the same day, they called a week later (7/6/2010) to graciously inform me that they had accepted my referral and would replace the set in 7-10 days.  Ok, I won't have to bother Amazon, who have already indicated they would replace it.  7/14 I call Samsung to inquire about status, I'm imformed that replacement will be completed by 7/21/2010.  This morning (7/16) I receive a call from Samsung that it will be another 10-14 days until they can replace the set.  I wasn't particularly pleasant and called an end to the games.I reinitiated contact with Amazon, and within minutes had a committment to replace the set.Consider these factors if you're thinking of purchasing this set, Samsung has no repair services in my area (at least for this product) of SE Wyoming.Definitely buy an extended warranty.  This is new technology.If you have problems within Amazons return period take advantage of it, don't waste your time with Samsung.  Samsung is deliberately trying to take you beyond the 30 day window, and just leave you hanging.Amazon's CS is superb, it's rare to find such responsive customer service in this day and age.UPDATE:  Amazon delivered a replacement unit on July 27, and picked up the defective unit.  The replacement is working perfectly, overall I'd give it 4.5 stars. I'm still keeping the box and packing materials, just in case.  I would have posted a full scale review but Amazon limits you to one per product.  My initial review of Samsung's customer service remains as stated.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV", "Author": "A. Ahmed \"TX Brit\"", "ReviewID": "RM7WLO1145A7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV after much agonizing over whether to just buy a new LCD tv or the latest generation 3D LEDs, and can say after 2 weeks of ownership that I definitely made the correct choice.  This TV is awesome, whether you are buying it for the 3D or just for a great TV.A quick run down of the TVs main features:Design - This TV is super thin at 0.9 inches.  OK, so not insanely thin as the 2010 flagship 9000 model at 0.3 inches, but then its less than half the price and design wise looks exactly the same.  I have it hung on a wall using the Samsung low profile mount, and it really does look like a picture hanging from the wall.  The silver framing is sleek, and if you use one of the internet apps like Picasso you can have photos play on a slideshow to really make it look like a painting.  With the wall mount, it protrudes only 1.5 inches - quite stunning.  If you don't mount, the supplied stand is very sophisticated too.Picture - This set is replacing a 4 yr old Sony LCD HDTV, so for me, the difference is amazing.  Superb sharpness, contract and colors.  The 240Hz creates an amazing picture, too good almost for some types of show creating what some call an artificial feel to what you are watching, but its all down to personal preference, and settings can be altered when needed.  For me, it's like watching through a window and I love it.  Black levels and edge lighting are perfectly good for me -  I have it in a well lit room and elevated above a fireplace and picture remains excellent throughout.Internet apps - I was not expecting to use these much, but they actually work really well.  I love the AP ticker, and AccuWeather, Yahoo and YouTube are also frequently used.  Best of all is that this TV has introduced me to Netflix, where the convenience of just clicking a button on my TV remote makes watching streaming movies and TV shows even easier than watching my DVR.3D - Amazing that this technology can be brought into the home.  Not much in the way of native 3D content yet (but what these is is amazing), but the TV will convert 2D to 3D and does this pretty well, especially if you up the 3D depth levels.  As you might expect, this works best in a darkened room, with HD signal and action packed scenes.  I watched The Dark Knight on the conversion process and was thoroughly impressed.Overall, I am truly impressed with the TV which packs in stunning picture and technology along with the best design aesthetics.

Otherwise, I would have purchased from Amazon.com.  I am writing this review, to hopefully help those others looking for a TV in this price range.I was skeptical at first purchasing a Samsung TV, having owned only Sony and Hitachi TV's, which have been pretty good.  I  did alot of research before puchasing this unit, talked to friends who had Samsung TV's themselves, looked at all the ratings and reviews on the Net, went to the store and looked at the 7000 series (because they didn't have a 8000 in stock) - and was Blown Away! WOW! the 7000 had the best picture that I had ever seen in a Television Set Period, and I am a very picky person - all reviews said that the 8000 should be even better. I went ahead and purchased it.  I am very glad that I did!After setting everything up and calibrating the settings - very important - (went close to the Calibration settings that [...] has).  I loaded Avatar into the Blu-Ray Player @ 1080p/24 and it was Amazing to say the Least.  I don't believe there can be a better picture.  Everything was crisp, clear, and life-like!  Like a window to another world.  I did notice with the Auto-Motion set to the default that things were a bit TOO crisp and life-like, almost like someone filmed it with a HD Camera, and you were actually watching Raw footage.  I describe it like a \"soap-opera\" effect.  After turning the Judder to 0, and the Blur to 10, in Auto-Motion, there was a very happy medium - Perfect Movie Watching Bliss!I find myself wanting to replay every Blu-Ray Movie I own, just to see it on this TV.The viewing angle of this TV is like all other LED, LCD, or Projection TV's, Not optimal - the picture does get a bit lighter from an extreme angle and that's it - still very very watchable, it is much better than the at-an-angle picture of my Hitachi Projection TV.  It is not a reason to bash this Product. The black levels are amazing, the Uniformity could be a bit better in All white backgrounds, but that is extremely rare and hardly noticeably.  Like most people I do the abundance of my serious Movie watching sitting in line with the Center of the Screen anyway!The sound from the speakers is great, once you tune it, by default the speakers put out a bit more bass than the enclosures can handle, so a bit of vibration is produced, but after tuning, it was pefect!You really need a HD picture to see the glory of this television, a regular cable signal will not do the job, it will highlight every flaw in the picture.The Widgets and the Internet worked great with the Wi-Fi Adapter, Facebook worked fine, and the Utube loading speed of videos where good. I love checking my stock figures, while not having to break away from the show that I'm watching.The remote control could be a bit more tactile, I find myself having to look at the keys before pressing, and sometimes pressing the wrong key when playing games, because of the flat keys.I have yet to view anything in 3D, I am waiting for the prices of the equipement to drop before I do.  I didn't buy this TV really for the 3D feature it was just an nice bonus to have for the future.Now I can not speak on the Longevity of this product as yet, because I have only had it a few weeks, but I will definitely add to this review as the months go by. Also, I will try to post a picture of my setup tonight for all those interested.So to summarize, if you are looking for the crispest life-like picture that you can imagine, look no further you have found it in the Samsung UN55C8000.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Wonderful Customer Service", "Author": "bokonon", "ReviewID": "R1X9LSR3DYE7WF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my 60\" Sony A2000, which had suffered an optical block failure.  Although I thought the A2000 was great (before it died), the Samsung C8000 beats it in every way imaginable.  Most impressive is the black level--once you dial in good settings, blacks are *black*, while contrast and picture detail are retained. (Even out of the box, the picture quality is great, but once a few key adjustments are made, it's simply stunning.)Another nice touch is the 240Hz \"custom\" option, which allows you to separate motion blur reduction from dejudder.  By cranking up motion blur reduction to 9 or 10, and by leaving dejudder at 0 or 1, the C8000 will produce very smooth, plasma-like motion, while avoiding the \"soap-opera\" effect that many LCD TVs' 120Hz/240Hz solutions produce.Finally, a word about Amazon customer service.  As much as I loved my TV, when I removed the protective film, I found an unsightly dent in the bezel.  I contacted Amazon, and they immediately offered to send a new one and pickup the old one, with no return shipping charge to me.

With GREAT results!", "Author": "Mr. Mitesh J. Patel", "ReviewID": "R6OK5XD6CPSPF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply Breathtaking!  So much new stuff here that its hard to figure out where to start.  The picture quality is first rate, but I don't think anyone would expect anything less from a TV of this stature, so I'm not going to speak anything more about that - 8 million:1 contrast ratio!!.  Make sure you upgrade your HDMI cables to v1.4 to get the 3D to work best, although I've heard that it works just fine with other HDMI versions.I had originally thought the 2D movie to 3D feature was a bit over-rated by some other reviews that I have read, however after playing with it for a while, I have developed a new appreciation for it.  I recommend watching the Blu-Ray - Planet Earth, the chapter on Mountains.  The 3D was simply ashtonishing.  I can't seem to wrap my head around how the TV can do this 3D conversion on the fly, but I'm definately excited about this technology.  Earlier I had watched \"300\" with the 3D turned on and it was pretty trippy until I got sick to my head. It also works with video games like PS3 and Xbox360 (keep in mind its fake 3D and not as good as real 3D, but some will enjoy the new way of playing and watching TV). I thought Halo looked pretty impressive on the Xbox360, until I saw how good Gears of War 2 looked in 3D. It was hard to believe the 3D was fake, and I don't think I will ever play Gears of War without the 3D from now on.  Make sure you turn up the 3D settings to \"10\" for maximum 3D effects.  The amount of 3D pop up can be adjusted on a sliding scale of 1 to 10. Just about every video game looked great in 3D.I am not sure if TV this compatible with NVIDIA's 3D technolgy, but if it is, you may be able to play your PC games in REAL 3D by connecting your computer!  I'll update this when I find out more.I have not tested the real 3D yet because I have not received the 3D player yet and PS3 has still not updated its firmware to play real 3D. But I will update this after testing it.The downsides to this TV are as follows (I admit these are nitpicky complaints):- Several people have complained that this set does not display 24p properly.  I have tried to the best of my ability to verify this, however, with the effects turned off (or set on \"clear\"), the TV looks to me that it is displaying 24p just fine. Since I cannot find fault, I'm assuming most viewers are not going to notice anything so I cannot dock any stars in rating.- the special features are hard to locate - good luck finding how to adjust settings on the 3D pop up level!- the 240hz smoothing feature, when active, ends up making the picture look so smooth that action movies resemble home video movies (also described as Spanish Soap Opra effect).  On the one hand it's great to have no flicker or choppiness, but it makes Hollywood movies look very low budget for some reason, despite all the new details that can be seen.  The only kind of movies that look good with the full 240fps smoothing are computer animated movies like \"UP\", and documentaries like \"Planet Earth\". The smoothness really works well for movies like this, the mountain scenes felt like actually being there, and made me dizzy!  I didn't have that effect when I had originally watched it in 24p a couple years back.  In fact I remember thinking back then how nice the mountain scenes would have looked if not for all the \"judder/choppiness\" of 24p.  For all other movies I keep the setting on \"Clear\" which brings back the cinematic 24p picture judder.  As annoying as the choppiness is, it sure brings back the Hollywood Magic.- The illuminated \"SAMSUNG\" logo that is directly under the TV picture is annoying since I like to watch movies at night, however, I later found out this can be turned off in the settings.- The TV isn't as sturdy feeling as my previous flat screen.  Because its so thin, it tends to wobble in its base if tapped, and it just gives me that uncomfortable \"unsturdy\" feeling.  This is not a big deal though, I don't think it will fall and you can always choose to mount it to the wall.- The flat remote control is cool to look at, but difficult to operate since you can't \"feel\" your way around the keys.  However, you shouldn't have to use the remote much since most of us use the cable box remote anyways.My final verdict:  Buy this TV if you are REALLY excited about 3D as I am, I don't think you will be disappointed. Don't upgrade just for picture quality. last years 240hz models look just as good, and some reviews say last years look even better.20April UPDATE: I have finally tested the Monsters VS Aliens 3D movie.  The 3D was in fact first rate in most scenes of the movie (even better than theater 3D, but NOT better than IMAX 3D).  The fact that this was the very first 3D blu-ray movie is obvious because there is occational ghosting present in some scenes (double images).  While many critics have quickly chosen to complain about this, I see another point of view.  There were just too many perfect 3D effect scenes in all types of enviornments for me to believe that the ghosting is inevitable.  I think the occasional Ghosting effects were due to this title being rushed out the door with the release of Sumsungs new 3D TV lines.  I don't think there will be any issues with removing the ghosting from future titles when more time is given to master the 3D content.

After comparing and tweaking and tweaking and comparing different settings, I finally settled for the right combination that is now, to my eyes, the most brilliant and impressive home TV picture I have ever seen.I spent the last 2 and a half years with a SONY 52 inch XBR5. Back then, it was between that and the equivalent Samsung 52 inch. The SONY's low glare screen and perhaps the name \"SONY\" made me opt for the Bravia. I was wishing I'd gone \"Samsung\" within about 10 months, when the SONY all of a sudden starting having some serious \"issues\" with its picture.Fortunately, I bought the extended warranty. The techicians had discovered that all of the out of focus, double vision, lines of interference and sometimes even \"all plaid\" screen was a circuit board problem which would cost more to fix than the set (now nearly only two years old) was worth.I was sent a check for the cost of a replacement, which was an XBR9, but also was now \"only\" 1800 dollars instead of thre 3500 I'd spent on the \"5\" two years earlier. Ouch!My wife and I waited did more research for about 8 more months while the SONY problem kept getting worse and worse. Finally, we'd \"had it\" and put the warranty money toward the just out C8000 series from Samsung.The LED backlight issues that Samsung was reportedly having are now a thing of the past with the 8000 series. I see perfection. I love this TV. If you're not afraid to spend the 3200 dollars for almost the best money can buy (the C9000, from what my salesman told me, is the same picture but with the \"guts\" of the TV in the base (wow!) and the screen a mere 1/3 of an inch thick. The 9000 remote also has a little TV in it if you have to take a bathroom break during the big game...you can \"take it with you.\"I figured the additional bells and whistles weren't worth the extra 2500 dollars I'd have to spend, so I went with the \"second best\" from Samsung.I haven't tried the 3D mode yet. I need to buy glasses, but, honestly, I wasn't even aware it was 3D capable when I bought it.The new brushed titanium thin frame is very cool, the shiny screen isn't that bad reflection-wise, and I do believe it makes the picture even clearer, and, I am just extremely happy with this set.

I had researched televisions for nearly two months before finally pulling the trigger on the Samsung Un55c8000 led tv. I was initially torn between going with a plasma or an led/lcd tv. Every major electronic review site (cnet, hometheatermag, soundandvision) rated the plasmas (both panasonic vt25/samsung pnc8000) as having the best picture quality. I visited different stores and seen these higher end plasmas and yes they had amazing picture quality but even in a dark lit room I still wasn't blown away my the image. I noticed the led tvs where always shown in dynamic mode which gave them more of a \"pop\" but the color reproduction was way off which detoured me away from them. I was just about to purchase the Samsung Pn58c8000 plasma tv when I managed to walk into a local higher end electronics store and seen the Samsung c8000 led tv playing 3:10 to Yuma (awesome movie)on blu ray and I was literally in awe on how clear and amazing the picture was. Now I had seen the Panasonic vt25 plasma playing a blu ray (ice age 3)and again it looked amazing but not like this led. Now what truly sold me was not just the picture quality but the ability to cancel out the \"soap opera\" look that many 120hz and 240hz tvs display (bad for movies). Long story short, I have had this tv for almost 2 weeks now and I'm VERY satisfied and happy with this purchase. I have played around with the picture settings and have managed to get an absolutely jaw dropping picture. The blacks on this t.v are second to none when comparing to other edge lit lcds but there are other tvs out there (Lg lx9500, Panasonic vt25)that do have deeper blacks. This aside I still would purchase this tv over all others out there. The tv's speakers are great, viewing angle is average but if you constantly view your tv from the side then go with a plasma but even if you're slightly off to the side you won't see any changes in picture quality on this tv. The internet features are pretty cool, we stream movies through both netflix and hulu plus and surprisingly everything runs very smooth. I have read others complaining about constant dropped internet signals when streaming video through this tv but I recently upgraded my wireless router to a dual band router and with my tv connected wirelessly I have had absolutely no problems (no stutter or lag) when streaming a movie. 3D on this tv is actually not that bad, my girlfriend and I watched Shrek in 3D and we were really amazed that most scenes in the movie actually looked three dimensional, though honestly the picture quality on this tv (especially watching a blu ray) is sooo good it almost looks 3D in 2D! I've watched movies, sports (football looks stunning), and local cable tv and all in all this tv is awesome. I got this Tv, a Samsung 3D blu ray player, and a 3D bundle kit for $2,100 with free shipping and I feel like I got the absolute best deal in the world! I'll end it on this note: DON'T let user reviews, expert reviews, or friends decide your purchase for you. There is absolutely no perfect television out there and ALL tvs will have some sort of flaw. Look around at different stores and don't be afraid to play with the tvs settings or even ask to see a blu ray movie played on it.

My two cents are to help those like me that were on the fence for about two months and then finally decided to pull the trigger. My first thing to do is to tell you what I upgraded from- a Panasonic 55\" HDTV rear projection (no hdmi ports) with a Panasonic progressive scan dvd player. My first impressions after a week of watching satellite tv, blue-ray dvd, and 3D is--WOW! I bought this tv, the 3D blu ray player, the starter kit (included in my purchase at no charge), a wireless adapter for the tv, and two hdmi cables. Purchased everything through Amazon rather than a retail store for (a) a better price by $350 over BB, and (b) to save the sales tax of over $200 to get a new entertainment shelf/bracket unit. First thing on my mind is if you get this setup get the hdmi cables because none are included with the tv or the blu ray player. I'm also glad I got the wireless adapter because it's much cleaner and easier to access the internet content. The 3D content is what we're all paying for so I'll start with that. First, I'm glad that DirecTV includes four 3D channels at no charge, and the system recognizes the tv is able to run 3D so it adds the channels when you add them to your guide. Second, I find myself using the 3D effect for regular programming to give HD shows added depth and dimension. True 3D content is thin right now, but I'm getting great enjoyment watching Lord Of The Rings (my standard dvd extended versions)in 3D with the upconverter on the tv. True 3D content pops off the screen, and upconverted television programs and non-blu ray movies get a feeling of depth and background dimension. Regular HD picture is beautiful. The blu ray picture is incredible. As far as the internet apps, I use Netflix to stream movies and Pandora for music. The Netflix picture was not impressive but I had to upgrade my internet speed to get a better quality picture (not the TV's fault). I was worried about having these items shipped but had no problems. The tv was delivered by a local shipper and was checked for damage and was powered up before they left. Everything programmed easily (no geek squad necessary), and tweaked settings to my personal preferences over the next few days. Everything is working flawlessly thusfar. Bottom line for me is if 3D becomes the next frontier of in-home entertainment, I am ready, and if 3D doesn't pan out, I still have an HD tv with internet apps, beautiful picture and sound, and awesome blu ray viewing, with the added benefit of giving a 3D-like look to any movie or program.

For pros/cons, you can go read a professional's review.I have been using this product for over 3 months now with no problems. My advice would be to search around online for the best available price for this unit.I recommend purchasing TVs (especially models like these) brand new because units marked as \"used\" more than likely not have some kind of defect.First a note on Samsung: I have purchased many different electronics from Samsung over the years including slim CD players, cellphones, monitors, and many HDTV sets.I realized that the company is extremely fast at innovation and competitive pricing but the build quality is not as solid as compared to more expensive brands (ie. Toshiba, Sony, etc.)I am therefore not surprised that many reviews here will obviously be negative reviewers complaining about product defects and such.I received a brand new unit which performs amazingly especially with a samsung 3d blu-ray player. I also have this connected to a Acer AspireRevo AR3610-U2002 Desktop (Dark Blue) which I also recommend for internet and movie streaming online. (You can read my review also.)After just a few weeks of watching rented blu-ray movies, watching normal TV just feels strange. You immediately notice the lack of vivid picture quality and brightness of normal television sets and regular DVD movies feel sub par. The 3D performance is amazing as you can feel the depth and clarity of movies. You literally feel \"sucked in\" when viewing 3D movies. Normal HD programming is just as amazing.Paired with a blu-ray player and HD cable box, there is nothing quite similar to the experience you will enjoy with this HDTV. Did you also happen to notice how thin this unit is?With the current overstock of HDTVs, you can expect a quick price drop on many HDTV sets in the coming month. I highly recommend this product as a normal TV and movie fanatic.

They spent a good deal of time explaining how to best take care of LEDs and surprisingly, were also knowledgeable about the product. They also have their projects showcased on their website,  [...]. Their contact number is 619-254-2007. If you are in SoCal, call them... You won't be disappointed....The setup is beautiful............. =) Wires are all concealed within the wall so no mess and no cluttered cables... Ran the wire for all 5 HDMI connections [currently only using 3..... Sweet...what else can I connect.... =)]The pic quality is awesome. Standard definition looks amazing and the 3d  feature is also nice. The active shutter provides the depth in the 3d scenes really nicely. Quite frankly, I don't really use my 3d glasses that much since not a lot of titles are available yet in 3d but it's nice to have..... Especially since all new titles are coming out in 3D as well. It'll be interesting to watch how this technology pans out.Watching DVDs and BLU-rays is nice especially since the picture quality is so crisp.I would highly recommend a PS3, especially since it's not just a gaming system anymore. The new firmware update also allows you to use it as a 3D DVD player. As far as uses, I am almost always streaming music and movies from my PC through my PS3.The BLURay player is nice because you can connect an external HD and it recognizes both NTSC and FAT file systems (the USBs on the tv only support a FAT file system which has a 2GB file size restriction) So no need to break apart files larger than 2GB. Also, it Pretty much reads all known formats from wmv to mkv to avi to mpeg4.... Nice....A few people had complained that the picture is so smooth it almost makes the picture  look like a Broadway play......This is largely due to the 240hz refresh rate required by the 3D and can easily be turned off. I prefer the high refresh rate.... The picture looks more real but its really about preference.Watch Avatar, Wall-E, 9, District-9 BluRay on this TV and you will never be the same.....

The unit I bought does not work with the Samsung wireless Linkstick USB adapter.  Since the same adapter works perfectly in a Samsung Blu-Ray player, the problem is clearly not the adapter or my home network.  Samsung agreed, and indicated they would send a repair person to examine the TV itself--perhaps the USB port is defective, or perhaps the software is defective.But when the repair contractor called, they informed me that the TV would have to be unmounted and remounted at my expense before any service would be performed.  Samsung confirmed that when I called them back.At Samsung's recommendation, I used their wall mount system and hired a professional to do the installation.  Taking the TV down and then reinstalling it after the repair would cost about $400 total.  (And if the problem is a software problem, it will all have been for nothing.)At this point I can simply run the wireless adapter through the Blu Ray player which is attached to the TV via an HDMI cable, so it's a defect I can live with.  But it's very disappointing to learn that in the future if there's a more serious issue with the TV, the warranty won't really help me.I've alerted Amazon to this customer service problem at Samsung.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Looks great when works - had two UN55C8000XF fail after warranty", "Author": "MagooWu", "ReviewID": "R2FX5853058SYZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When this TV functions, it has a beautiful picture and looks great.Built-in applications and USB/wifi attachment work well too.I purchased two of these televisions and both started to fail one month after warranty expired.

I have an Xbox360, Samsung Blue-Ray player, and Direct TV DVR attached via HDMI.  If one stopped reading I think is it likely a cable, but all three must be a component on the TV which went bad. I contacted Samsung CS and it was recommended that I unplug the TV and plug it back in.  No change, the problem didn't go away.  They scheduled a service tech to come to the house a few day later and during the waiting period I decided to leave the TV unplugged. When he arrive he plugged the TV in and it worked!  Wow what is going on here.  The tech suggested if the TV exhibits the same behavior to leave it unplugged for several minutes.  Between the October incident and mid January 2011 the HDMI ports stopped reading one time and I needed to wait about 60 minutes before the TV would read the HDMI ports.  At this point I'm thinking what kind of BS is this?  I never had to do this with the RCA!  And how long do I have to limp along with this crippled TV.  Since I had not registered the TV when I purchased it the CS offered to extend my warranty for 90 days if I would register it online.  I did and Samsung honored the extended time on the warranty. Thank you Samsung, because in mid January the TV would not turn on.  It would just display the red light on the front panel and click every second or second and a half.  Another call to Samsung CS to arrange for repair and another visit with the same tech.  This time a board needed to be replaced and the tech had it with him.  I thought everything was going to go well after this repair.  You know things break and Samsung honored and even extended the warranty.  No problem.  At the beginning of February 2011 I was sent an offer to purchase an extended warranty.  I decided to go for the 2 year warranty and I am glad I did, because today the clicking behavior has returned to the TV.  Strange as it may seem I also received a class action settlement letter from Samsung today related to the clicking behavior.  Unfortunately this model is not included in the settlement. I hope going forward over the next couple of years Samsung is able to figure out what has gone wrong with this TV, because I don't want to keep taking time off to wait for the repair guy.  The TV this model replaced was 17 years old and never needed a repair.  Going forward Samsung has joined the ranks of Sony and AT&T; and what that means is I will not knowingly purchase any products manufactured or sold by these companies.  They have grown so large they no longer concern themselves with individual customers or quality products.  Based on a couple of searches around the internet my experience is not unique.

First thing to do is to hook-up the TV to the internet and update the Firmware. This will make a big difference. This TV is crystal clear with EXCELLENT black levels. The only gripe I have with this is the viewing angle. The picture washes out rapidly beyond ~30 degrees (viewing from the center to the side). Hence the 4-star. Otherwise it is an awesome TV, the best one I've seen so far. The 3D feature (using the Aliens Monsters 3D Blu-ray playing on the Samsung 3D player) is good but I'm comparing this to my experience with Avatar on IMAX 3D so my expectations are very high. Even with the 55\" screen the 3D does not give you an immersive experience so the 3D effect, though good, does not feel impressive. The pseudo 3D (where the TV converts a 2D image to 3D) is ok. It looks ok for some scenese but strange for others. The 3D glasses are light and easy to wear over my eye-glasses. I don't get any headache even when wearing for a 2-hr movie. I played with the web TV and apps and they are good. The PC-Share feature works good (its hooked up via my Win-7 desktop via Ethernet cable) but is slow.

The Tv powered up and after two minutes I could hear sound perfectly from the set,but the screen was black.

Had I taken the extended warranty from Samsung, it would have barely expired.  I did save on that personally feeling a tv should last longer than 2 or 5 years to begin with.  Most show tv's lasting 20-30 years.  Samsung is no help at all in the repairs even though there are class action lawsuits against them.  [...] My TV just stopped coming on, zilth, no juice. Don't know if this will repair it or not.  In some areas they charge $150 for a estimate of repairs alone.  You can expect the parts and labor to be quite expensive to repair this type TV.  All you can do is hope the features still work that you paid for.  A Samsung representative told me they were having \"some\" problems with the power supply boards, (and other parts).  I question if a company knows there are problems on an expensive tv to begin with, why do they not do anything to correct the problem to save customers repair bills?  My only explanation would be greed on their part.My suggestion is buy the cheapest TV you can find if you are looking for a new, large, flat panel TV. If it quits, throw it away and purchase another. Sometimes every dog gets lucky and one will last a while.  That is what I will do and I am looking for another and it won't be Samsung due to the problems with this one.

C8000 has perfect blacks and no annoying lights in the corners like C7000. I owned 42' Sony DLP (720p) and you can't even compare those two sets. I paired my c8000 with the Onkyo HT-S3300 Home Theater System and I don't think I would go to the movie theater anytime soon :) Buy this TV if you can afford it and you won't be disappointed.Samsung UN55C8000 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "The C8000 is definitely an underachiever.  It is one highly disappointing television.", "Author": "A. Leetham \"ViDeeOhPhiUhl\"", "ReviewID": "R31QLEH5JI05MP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "While the C8000 is technically not Samsung's flagship television for 2010, -- that honor belongs to the 1/3 inch deep C9000 that costs $6,000 -- it does represent Samsung's best foot forward as far as picture performance is concerned.  With this fact in mind, I simply must say that it is a major disappointment.  The longer I have it, the more problems I find with it.  I have become more and more upset and frustrated with it by the day.  I actually originally rated it identically to my rating of the C7000, but after having it for almost two weeks now, I must lower my rating.  It is just a lot more disappointing and aggravating than my C7000 was.  Granted, this could be because I didn't have high expectations for the C7000, but I didn't find as many problems with it either.  I will say upfront that it does outperform the C7000 in a few respects, but not by enough to ignore all of the additional flaws; especially when you consider the fact that it costs more and it is supposed to handily outperform the C7000 in every regard.  Furthermore, it has far more problems with it's video processing and handling of 720p/1080i HD content than the C7000.  Therefore, I simply could not give the C8000 more than 2 stars.  I will start out by giving a quick outline of the flaws and strengths.  The flaws: Video Processing that is defective by design, a black level that is not up to par, poor screen uniformity and viewing angle.  The strengths: The design - If you like brushed titanium that has a distinctly silver look, as well as chrome, you will love the design.  I'm sure it will be a little too ostentatious for some, but will suit others very well.  I don't love the design, but I won't deny that it is uniquely aesthetically pleasant.  Overall, putting personal feelings aside, I think one would have to concede that the design is ultimately a rousing success. The features - The feature set speaks for itself, and holds it's own against the features of the high majority of other television. The Remote -  The remote is gorgeous and is as showy as the television itself.  None of these aspects bring down the rating of this television.  It is the picture performance and a lot of defects that really bring down the score.Black level: The level of black achieved by the C8000 is relatively dark, but still has to be considered a disappointment.  The black level is just not as deep or realistic as one might expect on a television of this level.  Samsung has been touting the precision dimming feature of this set since the very first specs for it were released a few months ago.  They made it sound like this precision dimming would allow this set to achieve a level of black that rivaled any full array local dimming LED LCD or Plasma.  Well, I'm sorry, it just didn't happen.  The precision dimming feature definitely doesn't work like it should.  The black level on this television is relatively deep, but nowhere near what it should be.  Basically it's somewhere in between most edge-lit led sets and full array local dimming sets or high end plasma's.  It's definitely not what I think we all believed it would be, and it definitely doesn't hold up to what Samsung stated could be achieved with it's precision dimming feature.  Considering the price of this television, and the fact that it is Samsung's best effort at excellence for 2010, the black level is definitely not up to par.  Due to the fact that the black level is not what it could or should be, shadow delineation is only about average.  You will not find details in shadows like you will on a television with a better overall black level.  Shadow detail is decent, it's just not what you may have experienced on a television capable of achieving a deeper, more realistic shade of black.Color Accuracy: There's no need to say a lot here.  The color accuracy, as well as the overall saturation of colors in any viewing environment is essentially flawless.  I really can't take points off here.  The color accuracy and the way the colors are displayed on this television regardless of which picture mode is being used, is absolutely stunning.Video Processing/Motion Resolution: The C8000 definitely loses some points here.  It's really quite sad because Samsung had absolutely perfected this feature on many of their previous high end sets.  It seems like they just tried to do too much with this feature on the C8000.  When I say that, I mean that there are just too many different adjustable settings that affect the video processing/motion resolution, and it seems this might be what caused some problems.  There are 3 different adjustable settings that affect video processing and motion resolution.  240hz Auto Motion Plus, Smart LED, and LED motion plus. I believe that defect within the video processing must be blamed on Samsung trying to do too much with this aspect of the television.  The biggest flaw I found is that this television is utterly incapable of properly handling 1080/24p content.  As I watched my first blu-ray on this television, -- which happened to be Sherlock Holmes -- every time the camera panned over something, I kept thinking that it looked funny.  I definitely wasn't seeing the innate judder of film.  It looked synthetically smooth.  Nothing like what I am used to from televisions that handle this content appropriately.  Therefore, I used 2 different calibration discs with test patterns, and popped in several films that I know to have distinct camera panning scenes.  My fears were confirmed, no matter which settings you use, or how you adjust the Auto Motion Plus 240 Hz feature, 24fps content cannot be properly handled by this television.  This television also has a problem processing 1080i/60hz and 720p/60hz signals, which will cause stuttering/hitching, as well as very short pauses with sudden jerky movements.  This means that you have to continue adjusting the Auto Motion Plus and/or LED Motion Plus features for every different program you watch on cable or satellite until you find a setting that works with that particular signal.  It is extremely annoying, and entirely unacceptable on a television such as this.Standard Definition Programming/HD programming via Satellite or Cable broadcast at 1080i or 720p:  This aspect represents another huge misstep on the part of the C8000.  The television absolutely cannot de-interlace 1080i content to display it properly.  (I confirmed this with two different test patterns) It also seemed to have a lot of trouble converting standard def 480 signals.  This means that all broadcast HD programming as well as standard def programming -- while still looking excellent -- loses some quality in the finer details.  The main images being displayed -- such as an actor's face during a close up -- still look outstanding, but details in the background look quite poor.  A lot of people won't even notice this type of thing, so it's not a huge issue.  I just feel that a television of this caliber should never have a problem with something as simple as this.  I will however reiterate that most viewers won't notice or care about this, so I don't deduct much for it at all.3D Television/3D blu-ray viewing: The C8000 has to be awarded some major bonus points here (Albeit with one huge caveat).  I must admit, viewing a 3D blu-ray on this television -- especially with the newest firmware, which allows customization and adjustment of the 3D level -- is wildly impressive.  I couldn't stop thinking about what a technological marvel this is.  The 2D to 3D conversion feature -- while nowhere near as impressive as actually viewing native 3D content -- is pretty remarkable.  Overall, the 3D aspect of this television is definitely it's biggest strength.  However, I must talk about something that has to be considered a huge problem with the 3D feature.  When you engage 3D, the television automatically adjusts the backlight, contrast level, and brightness of the television, while also changing the picture mode.  This is understandable because wearing the active shutter 3D glasses really dims the picture.  The key problem is that when the backlight, contrast level, and brightness are elevated on this television, the screen becomes a dark grey sky completely full of clouds.  Light begins to shine in from multiple areas of the panel.  It looks atrocious.  It is very distracting, and really takes away from the 3D viewing experience.  If you manually adjust the settings to lower contrast, backlight, and brightness, or switch to a dimmer picture mode, it absolutely ruins 3D viewing on this television.  It's a lose-lose situation.  To fully enjoy 3D viewing, the settings affecting brightness and contrast must be elevated, but that causes light to leak in.  Lower these settings, and the television is too dim to give you an immersive 3D experience.Taken as a whole, the C8000 is a good television (Albeit one with a lot of flaws and problems).  Good is not a word that one wishes to use to describe highly expensive, flagship -- as far as video quality goes -- television that represents a company's best effort at picture performance for an entire year.  The C8000 is better than the C7000, but not enough better to warrant a higher star rating or a higher cost.  This is especially true when you consider the fact that the C7000 was never intended to be anything other than Samsung's cheapest 3D TV and did not have half the hype surrounding it or create half the expectations that the C8000 did.  The precision dimming feature is essentially a gimmick, and doesn't allow the television to achieve a shade of black that is much better than other edge-lit led sets.  To cap off the review, I will say that I am extremely thwarted by this television.  I have already initiated a return, and I will be highly anticipating the LX900 and HX900 from Sony, the LE 9500 from LG, as well as the PNC8000 plasma with real black filter for bright room/daytime viewing.  After owning and returning both the C7000 and C8000, I have given up on Samsung LED LCD sets for 2010.Update: The following questions were posed to me in the comments section -- Are the black levels good?- Is there blooming?- What about the flashlight effect?- Does the screen get washed out if its across from a window?- Are regular 2D blurays and standart TV pretty to the eye?I promised that I would go in and update my review to give very basic answers to these questions.  Please read through the comments section for additional detailed information regarding this television.- Are the black levels good?Yes.  The level of black achieved by this television is very good.  One key point to remember is that the black level is very good while viewing the television from direct center, but starts to turn grey and somewhat bluish as you move further away from a center viewpoint.  Now, ask yourself this question.  Do you think that the level of black achieved by a manufacturer's very best effort at picture performance in any of their televisions should be very good or something better than that?  Again, this television represents the highest quality picture performance you will get from Samsung in 2010.  Do you think the black level should be better than very good?  I definitely do.  I think that paying close to $3,000 for a television should get you a black level that is absolutely superb.  Especially considering that the television you paid that much for is the best one that company made that entire year.  The black level of this television basically matches the black level of other edge-lit led -- B8000, B7000, C7000, etc. -- sets.  In most viewing environments, it is identical.  In a completely darkened room, it is barely deeper.  Some people won't even be able to tell that it is barely better.  Wouldn't you agree that this is not what the precision dimming feature was intended for.  Samsung stated that the precision dimming feature would allow this television to achieve a level of black that matched any full array local dimming television without exhibiting blooming.  Well, it didn't do this.- Is there blooming?Blooming on this television is very rare.  You will see it exhibit some faint blooming occasionally, but only in extremely dark scenes in which something very bright is also present.  Think of a scene in which 90% of it is darkened, but there is a bright light present.  A good example would be some of the Rorshach scenes in Watchmen.  The blooming is greatly improved upon as compared to the full array local dimming sets, but you will still barely see it from time to time.  The precision dimming feature did it's job regarding blooming.  Now, if only it could have done it's job regarding black level, and eliminating light shining through the panel.- What about the flashlight effect?As I originally stated in my review, it is highly present during the viewing of 3D content.  I suppose I should have elaborated and mentioned that if you elevate any of the picture settings that affect the brightness of this television, the flashlight effect will become extremely noticeable and distracting.  You will be able to see it using \"Dynamic\" picture mode, or if you raise any of the contrast, brightness, or backlight settings in \"Standard\" picture mode.  When viewing 3D content, the television automatically elevates these particular settings and light really begins to shine in from the corners as well as everywhere on the panel. If viewing this television in \"Standard\" mode, regardless of viewing environment, without raising any of these settings, the flashlight effect will be practically invisible.  If viewing this television using \"Movie\" mode, in a completely darkened room, the flashlight effect will be entirely non-existent.- Does the screen get washed out if it's across from a window?If you were viewing a film with a lot of dark scenes -- think Harry Potter or something similar -- the picture wouldn't necessarily get washed out, but the reflections would create a great difficulty in viewing this type of content.  If you are watching lively bright content such as sporting events or animated films, or if you are watching a television show or blu-ray that is full of brightened scenes, the picture will still look gorgeous.  It would not be washed out or difficult to view for any reason at all.  Overall screen uniformity is about what you would expect for an LCD television.  The picture looks best from direct center in the sweet spot, and gets worse as you move further to the left or right, or if you are looking at it from higher than the television.  Basically, the viewing angle is quite poor, but not more so than the viewing angle of other comparable televisions.  You definitely experience some color loss, and blacks turn bluish grey, but this happens on every LCD.  This issue is especially noticeable on edge lit LED LCD's.- Are 2D blu-ray's and standard TV pretty to the eye?I believe I addressed this pretty well in my original review but I will try to be more basic in answering this question.  2D blu-ray's look great.  They look about exactly like they would look on any very good television, which is to say exceptional.  There are many televisions that will display a blu-ray film just as well as this television does.  In most viewing environments, -- especially brightly lit rooms and daytime viewing -- watching a blu-ray on this television will look just like watching one on most other edge-lit led sets and really good traditional lcd sets.  Therefore, viewing a blu-ray on this television in a bright room will still give you a much better image than any plasma television would.  However, in a completely darkened room, blu-ray's will still look great, but the image will not hold it's own against led lcd televisions with better black levels and a lot of plasma's.  Standard television programming and high def television programming will look great -- with the exception of the video processing errors -- to all but the pickiest viewers.I really hope this helps.  I am not satisfied with this television at all, and I believe that a lot of people that purchase it will feel the same way.  You are just not getting what you pay for when you buy this TV.  Samsung stated that this television would be superb, and I was expecting excellence.  It is definitely not superb, and a lot of televisions that cost much less will give you the same picture quality (only without the 3D feature).  If you absolutely must have 3D right now, plasma is not an option for you, and you can't wait for a better television from Sony or LG, it's not the worst decision you could make.  However, you will have paid close to $3,000 for simply a very good TV.  If you can wait, and would rather spend $3,000 on an outstanding TV, there will definitely be much better televisions released within the next few months.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice looking TV when It's off!", "Author": "DenverZAK", "ReviewID": "RC56UPII931N8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The built in speakers started to make a buzzing sound a few months after purchase.

Buying it from Amazon was a winner: in-home delivery (included power-on acceptance test, but unfortunately did not include wall hanging), Amazon discounted price, and to top it off, my credit card had a 20% off coupon for certain models of HDTV purchased at Amazon, and this model was on the list.  For a big-ticket item like this, 20% off is a really good deal, it saved me around $400!I chose the 55 inch size because it's the biggest bang for the buck.  Roughly $2000 for 55 inches vs. roughly $5000 for 65 inches: you'd have to *really* want those extra 10 inches to pay $3000 more!Things I like about it:1) Really, really good picture.  That's what a TV is supposed to have, right?2) 4 HDMI inputs, that's a lot of inputs.3) Analog sound output works from every input source, including the built-in tuner.  That's a huge improvement over previous Samsung TV models.  I have the analog sound output connected to good speakers, without having to use splitters as I had to before.  There's also digital sound output, but I haven't used that.4) It has \"Game Mode\" which disables some sound/picture enhancements the TV is capable of, but greatly reduces lag.  \"HDTV lag\" is a big problem when playing games, but with this mode, it seems tolerable now (not perfect, but tolerable).  The problem is that all flat screens use a computerized grid of pixels, instead of an electron gun, so the electron gun can't be driven directly by the voltage coming in from the game console, as it was with analog, so reaction time is no longer instantaneous.5) It supports all HDTV modes, up to and including 1080p.  It looks good in all modes.  Some early HDTV's couldn't do both 720p and 1080p and still look good, so you had to basically choose one or the other, and that problem seems to be solved these days, which is good.6) The tuner picks up pretty much every TV station within range of my antenna.  It's greatly improved over earlier Samsung TV's, and is almost as good as my Zenith DTT901 converter box for my old analog TV (still the best HDTV receiver that I have found, and surprisingly, it was one of the cheapest models).Things I don't like about it (not really, just minor nitpicks):1) Not a lot of variance in the back, for hanging it on the wall mount.  The TV's placement will dictate where you drill holes in the wall.  If there's no studs there, too bad for you.  I would have appreciated more anchor points on the back of the TV, to make it easier to install.  We were only able to secure it to 1 stud, not 2 as is recommended, but it seems sturdy (as long as we're gentle with it).  Warn small children against ever touching this TV, and keep pets away.2) Difficult to reach connectors in the back.  Hook up all the little extensions they give you in the box, *before* hanging it up on the wall, to save yourself a lot of tricky reaching.  There's also no easily reachable \"quick connectors\" on the sides or front, so if you want to quickly plug in a video camera, laptop, or something like that, you can't, not without reaching behind the TV.3) Can't name the input sources.  You can only give them generic names like \"DVD\", \"Blu-Ray\", \"Game\", and so on.  Also, you can't change input sources with a single button, you have to cursor through a menu.4) Only 1 component input, and only 1 composite input.  This TV is made for HDMI, obviously.5) Only 1 cable input, so you can't hook up 2 cables at once, so you can't combine antenna feed with cable/satellite feed (we use a TiVo for cable, instead of running it directly to the TV, so that's OK for us).6) If you want to connect the TV to your Internet connection (the TV has built-in YouTube, Netflix, Skype, and so on), you have to buy the USB accessory and dangle it down the back, which is OK because this is still well hidden behind the TV.  It's something that should have been built-in, though.  It's probably the one thing they didn't think through very well, when building this TV.Good TV, and I'd buy it again.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV but careful with Amazon Price Match", "Author": "Greg Goldstein", "ReviewID": "R10RCEEVG37Q8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Firstly, the TV reduced in price $120 within 10 days of my order date.

Also, they have no control over \"who\" ships there products. I'm told the shipping process is automated.  They ended up shipping to me via UPS, a terrible carrier in my area.  They told me it was a 1:1,000,000 chance that UPS would ship a part of my order.  I had to drive and pick up the order from UPS.Now.. The TV:Exceptional picture, features are good, sound is terrible (as expected from a TV .9 inches thick).  I wish I could save more picture presets but I can't.  Samsung tech support is clueless on this.Motion:  This TV does a fair job on handling motion.  I watch tickers all day long (CNBC) and they shudder and shake despite Smart LED and the Smooth picture options set up.  This is especially apparent after a station switches to a moving graphic and back again (like ESPN sports especially).  When watching live sports, with the exception of any moving graphics, the picture is great.  I have tried 100 different setup options to fix this with only limited success.If you can afford this TV, you will not be disappointed with it's pictures and features. I hooked the set up to my laptop and am amazed how great a computer with a 55\" screen can be.3D is pretty much a joke at this time but does work well (assuming you buy the expensive glasses or starter kit).  Get the glasses that are rechargeable.  The starter bundle glasses burn batteries and are not the most comfortable to wear.I had no problems setting this TV up for the internet features.  Allshare feature is a bit of a pain as you need to load and continually update software on the server computer you have your personal media on.  Also, it won't read content on the external hard drives of your server computer (my desktop computer has both internal and external additional storage). I bought a Samsung 3d blue ray player and it integrates well using the BD-wise features.The remote is solid and fairly intuitive although the text buttons are difficult to read during the day. They are clear.  They are backlit and show well at night.  I wish the remote was black, not silver as this would allow the text buttons to show up better during the day.Overall:  I love the TV.  I'm not happy with Amazon's embedded price match policy; otherwise, Amazon is great to work with.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung as a brand no longer exists for me", "Author": "D.

Obviously, it's a first generation model, so it's not the perfected and polished product that you can expect form a regular 2D TV.Value for Price: 5/5 This TV is a great value at 2.3k with the start kit and 3D blu-ray player thrown in.Color reproduction: 5/5 Thanks to precision local dimming, the blacks appear very dark, and well lit area in the same scene looks bright. As with most Samsung LCD TVs, the Dynamic contrast on this TV is great. The other colors appear very natural even on the standard default settings.Features: 5/5 I haven't tested the Internet@TV feature yet, but so far the other features are fairly easy to use. But the shear amount of features available on this TV is nothing to sneeze at. The AutoMotion Plus feature produces the the Spanish Soup Opera effect on 60hz signal, but I don't think it's a draw back as it's easily disabled.Picture quality: 4/5 Maybe it has to do with the way my TV is currently set up, but I noticed that it did not upscale non-1080 sources very well. My older Samsung LCD TV upscaled from 720 much better.Black level: 5/5 See color reproduction above.3D experience: 5/5 After finally figuring out how to produce 3D signal from my PS3, the 3D movie I popped in looked great, only some  artifacts in very fast panning scenes. Fast motion scenes seemed to be OK. I had a fairly wide viewing angle for the 3D movie. The only issue I found here was that if you changed your distance to the TV, you'll sometimes need to resync your 3D glasses by turning it off and then on again. Waiting on my 3D blu-ray player to come so I can check out the 3D movies using HDMI 1.4 as the PS3 only has HDMI 1.3 sockets.Design: 5/5 I was initially worried about the metal chrome brushed design as some other reviewers have pointed out, but it turns out, it looks pretty good. If you have dark cabinet or stand the TV looks great on it. If your home is very modern, then this TV will fit right in.The one thing that I didn't realize until after I got the TV was that you'll need to find a solid wall to tie the TV to even if you're using the stand to prevent the ultra-thin TV from falling over due to accidental bumps (or excessively strong wind?). You'll want to tether the TV to the wall. Trust me, the TV wobbles a little on the stand without a little tethering support. However, this makes plugging in cables slightly more difficult as there is now shoelace like wire in the way. Not a big deal though, all the ports on the left hand side (from the front of the TV), so unless you must crawl behind the TV to get there, the tether is not in the way usually.Remote: Very nice new remote design. Has a back light for when the room is dark. My only problem with it is that I have a Samsung LCD Monitor in the room as well. And their IR signal is exactly the same. When I toggle power, change channels, or adjust the volume on one, they both react. Not a big deal. I just need to cover the remote on one side to prevent the IR signal from reaching one of the TVs.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best LED TV on the market!", "Author": "J T", "ReviewID": "R1RVMG0SF32NSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV was a B-Day from my wife and I have to say that it surpassed everything I thought it would be.

Anyway back to the TV, it's beautiful on the outside, however when you first turn it on it is pretty unusable. The stock setting are just plain awful, too bright, insane \"soap opera effect\" all the extras pic setting are turned on that need to be off. Basically you really need to spend few days, if not a week to tune this puppy right. After doing so, the picture is just stunning, clear and colorful. It responds quickly and all the internet gimmicks do operate as described (pretty useless to me). However one feature that i found pretty interesting is the DNLA service that's build it. If you have a computer(need to be networked) or a cell phone (I used a Nexus One for this) you can stream your media wirelessly (as long as the TV is on your network), the TV detects all devices automatically, just great if u want to show your phone pics or play music...Overall i'm very satisfied with the TV.

I did recently have a swivel mount added to the wall and you might need one because the only drawback to this TV is you need to be sitting almost straight on to get the best picture.

This is one of the most fully featured TV on the market.  I have absolutely no use for it's \"internet@tv\" online apps, and features...but they are there, and they work well.  It has frequent firmware updates, it's 3D capable, and it features a combination of edge-lit and back-lit dimming.Picture - I rated it a 4/5, but would have given it a 4.5/5 had I the option.  The first thing I did after powering on the TV was turn off the \"Auto-Motion Plus\" feature.  AMP is absolutely disgusting, and ruins the quality of film.  When AMP is set to \"on\" you end up with a camcorder experience, instead of a theatrical one.  Not to mention using AMP causes stutter in frame rate, and some screen tearing.  After a bit more calibration, the set looks pretty damn good.Value for price - I rated 3/5.  It is an excellent TV, but it could be priced a lot less.  I snagged it for $2390 here on Amazon, with a 3D starter kit, and 3d Blu-ray player free.  If those two incentives weren't included, I would have waited until the price of the TV hit around $2000.  You can get TVs with similar features and picture quality (just without 3D) for a lot cheaper.Black level - 4/5.  When the screen goes black, it is BLACK...but the second anything pops up on screen (even something as small as a letter) the blacks brighten up slightly.  I wish it used more of the back-lit dimming technology to correct this issue.  After a few hours, there is some slight clouding from the bottom corners of the TV.  It isn't really distracting, unless you're watching a really dark movie (like Sunshine or 2001: A Space Odyssey).Color reproduction - 5/5, no complaints here.  After some calibration the colors look vivid and accurate.3d experience - 3/5.  I just don't get it.  2D still looks way better, 3D just comes off as a gimmick.  I've showed it off to about 15 people already, and everyone thinks it's cool for about 2 minutes and then they take off their glasses and say \"Okay, I'm done...that was kind of cool, but I doubt I'd ever use it\"....and really, that's the only time I use the feature, just to show people what the TV can do.  I've tried it on all the PS3 games that are 3D capable, I'm slightly impressed by 2 out of the 5 games that are 3D ready, I would never use the feature if I was gaming competitively, though.Design layout - 4/5, I would rate it closer to 5, but there is one flaw, the TV is so thin that if you want to mount it on the wall you need use really thin cables to hook up external equipment.  Also, DO NOT buy Samsungs $250 rip-off mount.  You can buy basically the same exact mount off of monoprice for $12, yes that's correct, a $238 difference.Remote control - 1/5.  This is one of the worst remotes I've ever had, just use another all-in-one remote instead.Customer support - 5/5.  Amazon is the absolute best in customer service.  I can't think of any other retailer that would have sold me this TV, the starter kit, the blu-ray player, and delivery for only $2390 total.

Very slim, almost too slim.  All but the HDMI connections require a small adapter, which is supplied, but makes for more connections.  The wire brackets they supply are close to useless but better than nothing.  One caution is where you place the TV in relationship to windows.  It has a high gloss glass surface on the screen so light reflections can cause a problem during the day.  Haven't used the 3D as yet since I really didn't buy it for that feature I am not really concerned about it.  I did try the glasses on and if you wear glasses as well, this may be a problem.  The WiFi was a little difficult to get set up, but I finally got it to work and it works fine.  I have both a XP and a Windows 7 PC and I found that the DLNA will not play a Windows Media TV recorded by the XP system.  Since that is the only PC with a TV tuner I can not test the Windows 7 file format.  They are different and it is possible that the Windows 7 PC is the problem because it is the PC that the TV connected to and I do know that a Windows 7 PC will not play a XP Windows Media formatted file.I also wall  mounted the TV with a very nice mount I got on Amazon and saved at least $100 over the same mount at WalMart or Best Buy.  It is a VideoSecu Model MW370B Dual Swing arm mount.  Very sturdy and fairly easy to instll, if you are just a little bit handy.  Only thing you will have to do is buy 4, one (1) inch long mounting bolts for the bracket that mounts to the TV.  The ones with the mount are either too long or two short.  Just take one to Lowes or Home Depot to make sure you get the right metric threads.  Use a lock washer and a regular washer and it works perfectly.  This makes it very easy to connect the wires to the TV and still fits close to the wall, about 4 inchs at the most.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this TV", "Author": "Joe W.

I haven't had a chance to test out the 3D yet, but I am extremely curious how the 2D to 3D feature functions. 3D glasses are over $100 a piece for this TV set, so if you are looking for the 3D experience, expect to pay at least that much more to get yourself a pair. The one thing I have noticed is you don't see the darkest black unless you are viewing the TV from straight on. If you are watching at an angle, the black is a little more on the dark gray side. For the price I paid, and the rest of this TV, that is a small price to pay. One final thing of note: turn on the eco sensor (in the TV settings). The TV will sense when the room gets darker and dim the backlight accordingly.

I have been waiting for the right price point and technology and this set is it.  I looked at a lot of sets and this one clearly stood out from the rest.I knew it was the set when I saw a blueray playing on it and and people stood around in awe at the contrast, color, and realism.  It's almost 3d just in 2d.  Home 3d is in its infancy so it needs some work but the set can convert from 2d to 3d, so it's a fun novelty.  The glasses are fairly ridiculously priced but the will come down as will the set so the deal will only get better.This series was supposed to take care of the side and corner lights and although I never saw it in the 7000 series, I think they've done it brilliantly.  I have not seen any light issues.  Apparently the 7000 series had a red glow around the perimeter and this one does not.  I think the red would have driven me crazy, so another plus to this set.You will want to get hd cable or satellite.  It's going to cost a little more but it's well worth it.  10/mo for DirectTV I think it was and an upgraded satellite box is needed.  But it comes with hdmi and that makes the picture scream!HD shot video does look somewhat flat but it also looks like the actors could be in your living room, so your choice.  The colors are also so bright I had to turn them down.  Speaking of adjustments, do your self a favor after you get the set and google un55c8000 calibration.  The settings are overwhelming and can diminish the love.  I came across this [...] and the settings were pretty right on.Netflix is amazing.  The download is incredibly fast although I do see quick blank spots in a film, but that's probably because the connection is over wireless and I have an old router.  Pandora is also great.  You can create stations for your interest and then play a mix of them.  I only wish the stations stuck to the musicians, for example, if I create a station of Led Zepplin, they play other bands too.  The other bands are in the same genre but I would like to have the choice and put on the mix.  Oh well, it's still great and appears to be free and the sound quality is great.Delivery was very good.  I purchased from Amazon to get the deal that includes the 6900 blueray player, Shrek 3d starter kit and wireless adapter.  I could track the whole transport process, received a call from the local delivery service.  They set up a four hour deliver window which is annoying and unfortunately pretty standard.  They brought it in, opened it and plugged it in to make sure it works.  Good enough for me for free shipping!This set replaced a 15 year old Toshiba.  I am hoping this set lasts as long.

I've only owned for 3 weeks, but as of now I am VERY glad I did!I got this set with a bundle that is sometimes offered, the Samsung SSG-P2100S/ZA Shrek 3D Starter Kit, Black and the Samsung BD-C6800 1080p 3D Blu-ray Disc Player.  With this bundle you get a decent (but not especially great) 3d capable blu ray player, 2 sets of 3d glasses and the 3 shrek movies.  Since in order to enjoy the 3d capability you must have glasses, and more or less need a 3d capable blu ray player (since there is so little actual 3d programming at this time) you would have to purchase the glasses and blu ray player anyway, so getting them in a bundle is a nice savings.Shipping was via CEVA.  I saw all sorts of horror story reviews, on amazon and elsewhere about CEVA.  Their tracking of the package did stink, in that it was not updated frequently enough.  However, delivery occured on the day they said it would, and only a few hours later than I was told the previous night.  I am happy to give them a few hours slack, as I got the tv just a few days before Christmas.  The box was in excellent condition, the two CEVA people who brought the tv up expertly took it out of the package, told me they were not allowed to assemble the tv stand, and then promptly assembled the tv stand.  They hung around long enough for me to see that it worked, I signed the paper, gave them $20 bucks each and they happily went on their way.  4 stars.You do need to spend a fair bit of time calibrating all of the various settings.  The out of the box settings weren't horrible, but they could, and were, improved upon.  I don't remember my settings and can't check at the moment, but I'd advise anyone to look online at various reviews/sites and find the settings people chose and try these out and see if they work for you.  That's what I did, and, with minor tweaking, I kept them.My setup, is as follows:Cable through a Tivo Premiere, with a cablecard and a tuning adapter (unless you own tivo, you probably don't need to  worry about the tuning adapater) and no cable box.Yamaha RX-V667 7.2-Channel Home Theater Receiver (Black)Mirage Nanosat 5.1 Small High-Performance 5.1 Speaker SystemLogitech Harmony One Universal Remote with Color TouchscreenAnd the above mentioned blu ray player.The picture is, to my somewhat untrained eye, absolutely incredible.  I am constantly looking at the tv saying to myself, \"wow, what an insanely amazing picture.\"  I know reviewers such as cnet said there were better pictures, and I have no reason to doubt them, but I find the HD picture to be absolutely incredible.  The colors are simply AMAZING-- almost too vibrant! I may tone down the colors in coming days because they are actually TOO vivid.  I am an astronomy buff, and the pictures of galaxies and the like are absolutely incredible.Be aware that programming not shown in HD will look really bad.  My tivo has selected programs for me that were not shot in HD, and they do NOT look good on this set at all.  That is not a fault of this tv, but is simply due to the fact that non HD programming does not look good on a fancy new HD set.The sound is better than I expected.  That isn't to say its anything like as good as the sound through my home theater, it isn't.  But I was expecting from the reviews to absolutely hate the sound, and for basic programming like news or sports, I don't.  For watching movies with sound effects, you definitely will want some sort of home theater, the speakers on the tv won't cut it.  But for basic programming the sound wasn't really half bad.I have only spent about an hour watching actual 3d movies.  It is pretty cool, and you can definitely see depth!  I did not notice any crosstalk or ghosting, but all of the reviewers said they did, and they are surely right.  On the included Shrek blu ray the 3d picture was VERY good.The 2d-3d conversion feature was actually a pleasant surprise.  It is not a very strong effect-- in fact I am constantly wondering if it is in 3D at all, but it is, and this feature does work, to an extent.  However, a big drawback is that the brightness of the tv diminishes greatly (I have it set to be quite bright) and I find the tradeoff not to be worth it.  I hardly ever use the 2D-3D feature, and I doubt I will use it much in the future, except maybe as a novelty.Since I am a tivo customer, I have not used the internet connectivity at all, so I can't comment on that.Hooking up the wireless dongle, to hook my tv up to my wireless network was a less than 10 minute operation, and has worked flawlessly.  I have checked for firmware, very easily, using the remote.Finally, the tv looks very very good.  I was much more interested in form than function, but having a tv that is so beautifully thin and generally attractive is a nice plus.  The stand is a bit on the dull side, but really, who cares?I can't really compare this to the competing Panasonic, Sony and Vizio products, but I can tell you that as of now I am delighted that I bought this tv and have found the negatives mentioned by the professional reviewers not to affect my experience at all.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Nutmeg", "ReviewID": "RRNAF0XL4YYV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Razor sharp image,  Vibrant colors,  Excellent Black (there is an adjustment to make it even blacker.)  Total control over the settings  2D to 3D up-convert  Brushed Chrome BezelCons: 3D eye fatigueSo I read a ton of reviews about this and just about every other TV out there, plasma, normal lcd and led-lcd. I went to several stores sat in front of each and finally decided on the Samsung UN55C8000. So why did I do it. Plasmas, although I already own one, have a few drawbacks of there own. They get incredibly hot, especially when you have kids that keep them on 24-7 etc. etc. So I had decided upon an edge lit Led with local dimming since they offered great black levels without the extra $$$ required for a full back-lit array led. I was also seduced by the option of 3D, since a local retailer was offering a great deal on a couple of models that put them down in my price range (led not the plasmas.) That brought me in front of two makes, the Sony and the Samsung. When it comes down to a plug it in and forget it TV I would say the Sony wins the fight. However when it comes down to which one produces the best picture, Samsung has it hands down. The Samsung is built to be adjusted in every way you wish to with the ability to revert back to factory settings with a simple click. The vibrant colors and clarity of picture on the Samsung was just stunning. Side by side you could see that the Sony almost looked gray and washed out compared to it. A bright yellow screen would pop on both sets and you could see the difference instantly. The other problem was that the Sony couldn't reproduce a decent White, no matter how I messed with the settings. So that sealed it up for me. I bought the Samsung and took it home.Now to address some concerns on negative reviews. The \"Soap Opera\" effect can be turned off completely or adjusted several ways in the menus to meet your needs. The reason I have found for why it is so extreme is that while watching a 3D movie it compensates for the fact that the shuttering lenses of the glasses don't miss bits of the on screen action and it actually smooths out the picture making the 3D content more fluid. While watching 3D with it on it actually makes the movie seem normal. With it off you see a huge difference in the quality drop off. It also is a great effect for watching sports as it clarifies the picture. Although while watching the Quantum of Solace I turned it off completely.The colors on screen do wash out if you watch from an angle. Since I am the master of my cave, this is no concern for me, that is everyone else's problem. However with the colors washed out it looks more like the Sony straight on. After studying every LCD out there, this is not just a Samsung problem. If you don't want to deal with this then buy a plasma. However this is more noticeable in a well lit room with the screen back lights on full. In a dark room with the back light dimmed it is greatly diminished, almost unnoticeable.I read a review that said you could not tilt your head or watch 3D from an angle. This is not correct. I have watched from far down my hall, from an angle and even lying down. So I don't know what that was all about, maybe a firmware update corrected that. I don't know. The one draw back to the whole 3D experience is that it does cause eye fatigue. I don't know if that is a problem with the other sets out there, Sony had a special room set up at a retailer with a static image to show it off, but not in a real world application. The Panasonic glasses were broken. The one highlight of the 3D experience however is the ability to make a 2d movie 3d. It is not exactly the same as a native 3d flick, however it does add a lot of depth and it does not create as much eye fatigue. I tried it out watching \"How to Tame Your Dragon\" 2d blue ray, and \"The Quantum of Solace\" also a 2D blue ray.Overall if you want the Best edge lit LED out there for the picture, get the Samsung. It will blow you away how razor sharp the image is.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3D TV", "Author": "Venkatesh \"Bostonian\"", "ReviewID": "R3VBVU2DJJ7WCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1.

After comparing and tweaking and tweaking and comparing different settings, I finally settled for the right combination that is now, to my eyes, the most brilliant and impressive home TV picture I have ever seen.I spent the last 2 and a half years with a SONY 52 inch XBR5. Back then, it was between that and the equivalent Samsung 52 inch.  The SONY's low glare screen and perhaps the name \"SONY\" made me opt for the Bravia.  I was wishing I'd gone \"Samsung\" within about 10 months, when the SONY all of a sudden starting having some serious \"issues\" with its picture.Fortunately, I bought the extended warranty.  The techicians had discovered that all of the out of focus, double vision, lines of interference and sometimes even \"all plaid\" screen was a circuit board problem which would cost more to fix than the set (now nearly only two years old) was worth.I was sent a check for the cost of a replacement, which was an XBR9, but also was now \"only\" 1800 dollars instead of thre 3500 I'd spent on the \"5\" two years earlier.  Ouch!My wife and I waited did more research for about 8 more months while the SONY problem kept getting worse and worse.  Finally, we'd \"had it\" and put the warranty money toward the just out C8000 series from Samsung.The LED backlight issues that Samsung was reportedly having are now a thing of the past with the 8000 series.

If you're not afraid to spend the 3200 dollars for almost the best money can buy (the C9000, from what my salesman told me, is the same picture but with the \"guts\" of the TV in the base (wow!) and the screen a mere 1/3 of an inch thick.  The 9000 remote also has a little TV in it if you have to take a bathroom break during the big game...you can \"take it with you.\"I figured the additional bells and whistles weren't worth the extra 2500 dollars I'd have to spend, so I went with the \"second best\" from Samsung.I haven't tried the 3D mode yet.  I need to buy glasses, but, honestly, I wasn't even aware it was 3D capable when I bought it.The new brushed titanium thin frame is very cool, the shiny screen isn't that bad reflection-wise, and I do believe it makes the picture even clearer, and, I am just extremely happy with this set.

They are faster than most online company's when it comes to large flat screens. I have only purchased one of the 8000 series 3D led TVs, and the customer I installed it for has had problems with it since it was installed. The set is making a intermittent loud crackling noise. I had a repair tech over to look at it. The repair tech did not want to fix anything, he told me I should bypass the receiver and connect directly to the TV. That seems a little ridiculous to me, the receiver makes operating an A/V system a lot simpler for the user, and the noise is not emanating from the speakers in the room or the TV speakers (witch are turned off) the noise is coming out of the TV cabinet. I ended up getting the tech to replace the main board on the TV since he happened to have one on him, this did not fix the problem. After this did not work I connected the cable box directly to the TV and the problem still persists. So I have Another service request in to Samsung now and will report back when problem is resolved. The TV display is phenomenal, the 3D is good but better on the 8000 series plasma display. Also the 8000 series plasma did not have any problems.I have changed my rating on this TV, because it turned out the problem was caused by the cable box. Samsung's repair service came and picked up the TV on the second service call, took it back to their shop, tested it and found no problems. After retuning the TV I was able by process of elimination to trace the problem to the cable TV box. I would also like to add the repair service did not charge the $55 that Samsung states they charge if the warranty call turns out to not be a defective product.

You plug your TV via ethernet cable directly into your Internet router.  In this way, you get access to whatever apps the tv has.The problem comes with the sound.  On my TV, if you use the apps, sound \"defaults\" back to your built in TV speakers.  This is not what I wanted, I wanted the audio to go through my home theater amp for surround sound via the HDMI cables.  Well, ain't gonna happen with this TV.  You have to select \"tv speakers\" only to get audio.  For regular cable TV, the HDMI cable handles the audio just fine, this is only an APP problem.I also have a Samsung BluRay player, and I do NOT have the same problem there.  The HDMI cable for that unit sends the video AND the audio through the home theater amp.  So, I have Netflix apps on both the TV and the BluRay, I will obviously use the BlueRay App, because it handles audio.  But sometimes we can only find a movie we like on amazon.

I purchased this tv after a fair amount of research and comparision between other models and for the money I do not regret my purchase. I purchased it early this year and have not been disappointed in my purchase.Summarizing good and bad points in as few words as possible:Pros:*Price: at least at the time for the size and features was hard to beat. 3d works great with the playstation and for the price range it was hard to find another tv that offered it! It was not a selling point but with the price difference between the 3d version and the non 3d version, I would definitely say it was worth the negligible price difference. 3d glasses do need to be purchased separately and are still fairly expensive, but that is to be expected.*Quality and Aesthetics: Aesthetics in electronics is something I highly value and Samsung did not disappoint. This is a beautiful television, as equally a piece of art as a piece of home electronic hardware. I am not crazy about the stand but it is certainly nothing to scoff at.*Ease of Use: Not much to say but it is incredibly easy to configure and use. There are enough features and settings that you could spend a fair amount tweaking to satisfy personal taste or just use one of the well tuned presets.*Features: A definite plus is that you can enable and disable automatic eco dimming(which our old Sony LCD lacked and at times made for hugely distracting tv watching) and enhanced motion (aka you can turn off the 'soap opera effect' which I find a must for watching certain films.)Cons: Not Many!* For the cost it should just incorporate a wireless adapter. The way the description read on Amazon it was hard to tell whether it was included or not. It was not. The separate dongle runs 30$. With companies like Vizio including a built in wireless adapter on much much cheaper models, it seems silly for Samsung not to as well.*Remote: Certainly far more aesthetically pleasing than most tv remotes Ive seen, it could stand to be improved upon for use with apps. Again Vizio includes a built in qwerty keyboard on some tv models and this would go a long way in making use of Samsung's internet apps and app account.*Viewing Angles. If you have a living room with seating off to the sides of the tv and viewing angles are important to you, this may not be the screen for you. Viewing offcenter results in extreme bluing of blacks that is quite noticeable, especially in dark scenes. It is not so much a distraction in lighter scenes and seems to be something most casual viewers will not pay attention to.*Wireless: Samsung apps are a bit cumbersome and don't always work as you'd hope. It looks as if Samsung did away with the policy that you were required to keep a credit card and credits on file with an online Samsung Account to be able to download even free apps like Netflix.Conclusion: A solid piece of technology that could be better but certainly outperforms a vast majority of competitors in the list of features, build quality, aesthetics and performance.

I have had this TV for aproximately 6 months, and waited to see if there were any problems before I wrote my review, and I can happily say that the TV works great! We don't use the 3D feature a lot but it works great, no problems at all. Colors are brilliant, it looks great on the wall, super thin and I have all the wires hidden. It looks like a picture on the wall. I only have one suggestion. I received this TV in February in Pittsburgh, the temperature was 22 degrees, and that thing was on the truck till 4PM. Please do not have the delivery guy take it apart and plug it in to see if it works. Inspect it visually, see if the box is dingged up, check the glass for any visible cracks and if that's ok, just leave it at that. I called Samsung and asked, they said that the operating temp. is supposed to be above I believe 50 degrees(it's been a while). They suggested I let it sit @ room temp. for 24 hrs., which I did. No problems, no cracking - ever. I work on and build computers and I know that it is a big no-no, to plug them in if they have been in the cold. The circuitry on the motherboard and other boards is very sensitive, and then you have condensation from the heat of electricity warming the boards up, but they are very cold. Bad scinerio. Be patient and let the TV warm up, you'll be happy you did!! It was delivered by Pilot. TV was nicely secured to the side of the trailer, which made me comfortable! The delivery man was very nice, but he was by himself. I was glad that i was there to help him take the thing off the truck. I don't know how he would have done this by himself without smacking the TV once or twice, eek? I have read some reviews that complain about the sound. I think the sound for the one inch thick TV is great. I have a home theater system hooked up to it but we generally only use it for the movies. You really do not need it, honest!

The 2011 models are out (check your big box store for the \"D\" series), and they are $3000+, which didn't interest me due to the price, although they are almost bezel-less, so there is a high 'cool' factor with them.  I nearly stole this TV from the e-tailer and I am very pleased with the TV unit it's self.My room dimensions are small so the viewing location is only 8 feet from the screen (that is from my eye point to the center of the screen.  This is an incredibly bright and fast monitor which trumps so many others that I have seen.  I have been waiting a long time for a 55 inch 3d LED that I can replace my long-since antiquated 32 in CRT (I know...like comparing a radio to a CD, but that's what I had prior), so there is no comparing what I had to this.The monitor is easy to mount on an array of flat panel mounts.  Most interesting to me was the weight, without the stand.  Most people that I know will either mount them on a wall or monitor stand designed to mount a flat panel screen and not use the very cool stand.  I found that the monitor is very \"light\" without the stand.  It's about 30 lbs, which means it's not going to strain your wall or put much load onto that monitor stand.When I powered up the set for the first time, I was  very pleased with the turn-up tones and the way that the set brings up the lamps instead of slamming them on.  Even though this is an \"LED\" that means that the backlight is from an LED source.  It's a well designed feature.I have a Denon AVR3806 which is a little dated, but I am happy with the HDMI outputs from it to my monitor with a source of the HD cable TV box.  When on HD or on SD, the picture is extremely clear.  Every so often, I get a little pixelation or lag but I think that the reason for this is the source material not the electronics.When watching sports or watching an HD documentary, it's a stellar picture...In fact, the refresh (at 240Hz) is so fast, that it turns an HD into a picture that is a little cooler than my CRT.  I have adjusted my colors and my tint, but the real reason is the speed of the monitor's refresh.I have not tested this set with blueray or 3D as of this writing (I just bought the BD-D6700 from Samsung, so I expect some really good things from it).Overall, I am impressed with the black levels, the color is extremely vivid, but the refresh rate so fast that it overwhelms most sources giving the viewer a more 'digital video taped' feel to the image on the screen.This is a very high end set.

After contacting Samsung about the blotches on the screen I was told by them that it was an internal issue with the TV.  Fearful that the TV would end up worse than it started off I contacted Amazon with my concerns and Amazon was so good to me!  They quickly exchanged my set no questions asked.  I can't think of any better customer service!  I give Amazon 5 stars for service and bending over backwards for the customer!The second TV was perfect!  The blotches are gone and the screen is evenly illuminated!  We can enjoy watching movies again without the blotches showing up.  One thing to mention is that initially during the setup of the TV the wired network would not work.  It would in fact crash my entire home network where computers connected to the network were not able to connect to the internet or have access to the router.  It took me almost a day to track down the root cause of the problem.  Turns out the TV for some reason kept getting assigned the same IP address as the wireless router.  During the network test it would never pass the gateway test and if anyone ever get stuck at this point try checking what the DHCP server is assigning the TV.I took delivery of the TV on Jan. 6, 2011 and it's a wonderful TV that reproduces great blacks and shows bright whites.  That is until the light comes down and you'll start seeing some light leaks around the lower corners as well as uneven lighting on the screen that produces a clouding effect.  From what I read it seems that this clouding effect is a result from defective LCD panels or a defect in the way the panel is made.  It's a shame that the flagship TV from Samsung doesn't live to its standard.  A flagship product by definition should be perfect and should be the cream of the crop.  For all the bells and whistles this TV has it's really not suited for watching movies in a darkened room like it should be.This problem can be easily seen while switching sources such as \"PC\".

In dark scenes, there is really bad clouding, very distracting, (if this was a $1000 TV, i wouldn't be too bothered, but it is triple that), also, if you sit even slightly off center while viewing, the picture deteriorates rapidly, blacks turn gray and skin tone almost become shiny. Brutal. And all of these problems look even worse when watching Blu-Ray.The internet@TV features are pretty cool, although the Facebook app doesn't seem to work.The sound from the speakers on the set is decent, but nothing to write home about.The 3D is good, the 2D to 3D conversion is a waste of time though. Pointless.I returned the first set i got hoping that i had received a dud, but when the replacement arrived it had all of the same problems as the first one, except the clouding was even worse than before.So i went back to Best Buy today and set up a second return, only this time i have decided to replace the terrible LED UN55C8000 with a 58\" Plasma, the PN8C8000, also Samsung. Hopefully this will work out when it is delivered in 2 days.I'll post a review in a few days.So, overall, don't buy this bad TV.

While the picture clarity is superb, the TV began to have problems in 2011.  Random lines that resembled jigsaw puzzle pieces would show on the screen.

In December 2012 the sound would work at times, other times it would make a high pitch screech.I hardly used this television in the short time that I had it.  I paid over $2500 for this piece of junk.  My Sony Plasma is still in perfect operable condition after 10 years!  Shame on Samsung for not doing a recall on this TV.  I checked the online boards and there is no shortage of people that have been victim to poor product development and the worst Samsung customer service.  I used to be a huge fan of Samsung--I own 3 Samsung phones, a Samsung fridge, 2 additional Samsung TVs--but I am a fan no more.

My TV arrived defective with a stuck/dead pixel in the center of the screen. It was a green dot that would not go away. Some people recommended applying pressure to release the stuck pixel, and others recommended applications designed to flash the screen to unstick the pixel. Unfortunately, neither strategy worked, and for the cost I could not justify living with that dead pixel in my home theatre.So I called Amazon and the TV was picked up without any delay. Thank you Amazon.  This is a GREAT TV. I was disappointed to receive one that was defective (I bought it used from the Amazon warehouse), but am now back in the market and will consider buying this TV again.The graphics on the screen are excellent, and the TV is very easy to setup.  One thing I hated about the TV is the cheesy remote. The remote matches a remote for a $200 TV, not a $2000 TV.The prices for this TV is constantly changing, and I've even seen it offered in China for $1200-$1500 (brand new).  One could buy it there, and have it shipped -- but of course, we all know there are risks involved with doing that. So again, I'll be purchasing from Amazon once a new sale comes in.The visual appeal of this TV is amazing, and it's a direct competitor to the Sony KDL55NX810 model.  One should note that Sony has alot of stuff built-in to their sets. The sony is 1.4\" thick and this one is .9\".  Internet apps on this TV was not very easy for me to access. If someone has a shortcut to accessing the internet apps, please post it here.Overall, excellent TV!UPDATE:1/19/2011 -All, I ordered the TV again from Amazon. This time the set was purchased BRAND NEW, with the 3D bundle and 3D Blu-Ray BD-C6900 player. Delivery came from a different company. The delivery person didn't talk much, and that's a good thing to me in a way.  Anyway, the TV is AWESOME!  No dead pixels.  3D works great. I am selling the 3D Blu Ray player, however, and just going to use my Playstation 3 in its place.  The remote appears to have changed. Either that, or someone had swapped the remote in my used TV  purchase.  The new Samsung remote is backlit with white LEDs and matches the TV perfectly.  The remote now feels like it is made for a $2000 tv (as opposed to my previous experience described above).Put of all the 55\" 3D TVs available below $3000, this is the BEST one that you can buy.  Internet was easy to configure. Soem people had some challenges with installing the Internet, but I did not have this experience. I'm using a Netgear WNDR3700 router, which broadcasts a 5Ghz signal and has DLNA for the TV.  Regarding the media share, you need to have the TV connected to your netwrok view Ethernet to get it to work.  This is not a deal breaker, and I will find a way around this, but it just seems odd that I can't have DLNA running with the USB Wireless that's already attached to the TV.The TV has connections for an HDTV antennae, which is tested and works perfectly. There is even a diagnostic menu that will show the signal strength of the local HDTV channel.I am streaming Netflix to the TV and have not had any major issues. The quality for Internet movies is not terrific. This might be due to my Internet connection speed (max 3Mbps), and I'll try to provide an update on any improvements after switching to a faster ISP.I have no regrets with this TV, and recommend it to all!  5 STARS!", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Picture  is overwhelming !", "Author": "ECCLark", "ReviewID": "R36FFTAAIW1F09", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Setup is extremely easy with HDMI cables.

I bought it again last week and I am so thrilled I did that. This TV is much much better than the earlier. Moreover, the firmware updates were already installed on the TV and I did not have to do anything else.I have watched the following blu-ray movies on it:-- Green Zone (This movie itself is made in mostly dark scenes, but I enjoyed it)-- Prince of Persia (stunning quality - both Dynamic and Movie mode)-- Cars (Absolutely freaking stunning)I also tried a couple of Netflix movies online, but my internet speed is slow. I could not play HD movies due to low internet bandwidth but the regular movie quality was amazing.At first on Netflix, the movie looked so real I thought I am watching the \"making\" of the movie. Later, I swithced the mode to \"Natural\" from the menu and it looked like a movie. :)I yet have to explore all the TV features but it can be tweaked to a better settings from pre-set factory ones.Just like my younger one 2 yrs old, I am falling in love with this TV more and more with each passing day. :)************* Old review ****************The movies I tried on the TV were:Nemo (DVD format; 2D mode)Legion (DVD format; 2D mode)Aliens vs Monsters (3D mode)Avatar (Blu-Ray format; 2D and converted to 3D mode)I changed the playing format on the TV to \"Dynamic\" mode before playing Avatar. I swear the colors I saw in Cinemark theatre weren't half as good as they look on this TV. Magnificent!! Awesome!!I also tried to watch the same movie in 3D mode. The depth of the upconverted 3D mode was only partially good as compared to the actual 3D movie you would watch with 3D glasses.Another star was lost because of the poor double-edging (crosstalk of images) of the some of the scenes in the movie (Aliens vs Monsters) when you watch it in 3D mode. People say it happens occasionally, some people said \"it is rare\". Let me tell you that it happens almost all the times when the background in the picture is dark and the object is bright and glowing in it. Example: The planet in the sky before it breaks or the calendar behind the guy who is laying with a ping-pong ball or the inside view of the church. 90% of the movie is bright so we don't see double-edging 90% of the times.God forbids, if we get \"Lord of the Rings\" in 3D format someday in future, you will see double-edging (or crosstalk) 60% of the time as the movie will have quite a dark scenes in it. I spoke with Samsung and the guy advised me to install the latest upgrade to the TV, which I did but it didn't fix the issue.And when I have spent the maximum dollars ($3000) for this technology, I don't want to compromise with the quality of it.I also played Nemo in 2D mode and the under-the-sea dark scenes had cloudy edges around the objects in it (such as Dory or Nemo's dad).One more thing: I tried to play the blu-ray movie from my laptop and hooked my laptop to the TV through the Denon receiver. The movie on TV looked normal whereas on laptop it is ultra sharp and clear. And I know it is not the Denon receiver. Anyway, this did not bother me as much as crosstalk issues while watching 3D content.TV in 3D mode loses color if you take 2 steps to the right or left. So, it asks you to remain seated in Love Seat. If you sit on a chair besides you or another sofa on the side, you won't see half the colors. But this is expected. \"Angle Viewing\" is usually narrow in LCDs as compared to Plasma. However, 2D mode has larger angle view than 3D. But then, you don't dance around when you are watching 3D movies.Other than this, the aesthetics are awesome!!", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Four Weeks old and dead.", "Author": "S.

So if you're not a gamer then you're reading the wrong review.I was an avid Xbox 360 gamer and wanted to experience 3D gaming so I bought this TV along with a PS3. Now, the picture looked amazing and jumping from a 60hz to 240hz made me witness a big leap in refresh rate. The motion was really smooth. The picture was crystal clear and the colors and contrast was amazing!Now for the bad part; input lag in this TV is horrible. For people who don't know what an input lag is, it's the delay of your controller input to register. Although it may seem like an \"input-lag\" it's actually the TV delaying the projection which is basically the same thing. I did some research and found out that Samsung LED TVs are not ideal for hardcore gamers and Samsung tried to work things out by introducing the \"game mode\" feature in their LED models (not sure about the models before those). You can turn it ON/OFF in the setting. It sacrifices motion plus and other features to lower the projection registration, ultimately lowering the picture quality.I played a variety of games and although the lag was a lot less with the game mode on, it was still noticeable. I played  Uncharted 2, Battlefield: BC2, Batman: AA, Modern Warfare 2 and Super Street Fighter IV. The single player games like UC2 and B:AA were certainly playable but the online multi-player games were still a pain. Although, sometimes, I was aiming and shooting people spot on, the bullets did not hit them because by the time my shots registered they would move. However, my experience with SSFIV was much worse. Street Fighter requires quick reflexes which is why the lag got the most of me. I found my self getting hit despite blocking and missing ultras due to the terrible lag.I then played Killzone 3(single player) and Gran Turismo 5 in 3D. The 3D was amazing and and my jaw fell down for the most part.That being said, the TV is good for casual gamers who like to play single-player games. But if you're an online gamer then you should reconsider. The experience was heart breaking for me because it took me almost a year to put together enough money to buy all the stuff necessary for 3D gaming.

Monster box to bring but it fit into my Scion xB quite well.Hung it on the wall using the Samsung slim wall mount, $99 on amazon used,  hangs great on the wall.  The picture is great.  The 3D movie is amazing, except the glasses pinch my head too hard and they dont adjust.  Then I realized that I cannot use the samsung glasses to play 3D games via my attached computer. One needs a whole new set of glasses and emitter from Nvidia.  Returned all the 3D glasses and player till they sort out that mess.  My biggest complaint, WAS that I cant seem to dim the white light Samsung on the bottom of the frame.  In a dark room, its really bright and distracts from the screen.  Really silly that they cannot set a dimming function somewhere.  I have tape over it now,  Not a pretty solution.  I am tempted to take it apart and put a resistor into it.  The Samsung light looked really slick in the show room, now its a glaring problem.  Other than that, I quite like this device.  Correction:  Using the Light Effect option in Settings permits one to set it to off when viewing.  A big drawback of this set is that there in ONLY at 100Mb ethernet connection.  When trying to stream say a 25Gb hidef movie from a NAS, the connections slow speed causes a stop on the movie.

The picture is outstanding, and it is great for getting a lightweight and thin TV into tight spaces (which is what I was looking for).Here are my complaints so far. . . .1.  The remote control is really lame . . . Granted, most people will end up using a univeral remote at some point anyway, so it may be a non-issue, but for all the setup purpose, the thing stinks.  Flat buttons are hard to distinguish without looking at them, and it's awkward to handle.2.  The big complaint is the Internet function . . . I have been trying to get this TV connected to the internet for days, and I still haven't figured it out.  I've tried to do it wirelessly (which required that I purchase an additional USB LAN device for $60).  That hasn't worked.  I've tried to connect it directly to a router.  That hasn't worked.  checking the message boards on the internet, it seems there are thousands of people who seem to be having the same trouble I am-- it recognizes my router, but then fails a \"Gateway Ping\" test.  Don't know what that means.  After contacting Samsung they said it was a problem with my internet service provider (Comcast) . . . but really . . . In my home I have seamlessly connected my laptop, my iphone, my PS3, another sony blueray player, and 2 Apple Airport expresses to my ISP with absolutely no issue at all.  The problem is not the ISP.  The problem is obviously something on Samsung's end and they just haven't fixed it.  I hope they do in a later firmware update, but so far I have the latest firmware version and the problem persists. . . .So my advise is if internet connectivity is one of your big selling points on this TV, you should probably go with a Sony, whose products in my experience are much friendlier to network connection.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung 3d 55 inch", "Author": "J.

If it affected the volume it would drive me insane. So if not for the slight juttering & price i would have given 5 stars.Update 3 September 2011:Every person that comes over LOVES this tv, my neighbor, who is an electronics guru bought a very similar Samsung & helped me turn off the \"Soap Opera Effect\". Also the sound wasn't AMAZING, but how great can the speakers be in such a thin tv, I wanted to get a real home theater, but I don't plan on being in this house for more than 2 more years so it seemed like a waste so I got Samsung HT-WS1G Soundbar which is Great & I also LOVE.

As we tracked the package, we saw it in CEVA's hub 4 days before it was supposed to arrive here (250 miles from the hub).  Bottom line is today was delivery day and we won't see our TV for at least two more days because of CEVA's logistics.  While I understand logistics, I do not understand or appreciate \"guarantees\" that are completely ignored.  We received the free 3-d kit (which we don't want) a couple of days ago and we got the free Blue-Ray today, but no tv.  So....we cancelled the electrician and the satellite guy and will now be without a TV for several days while we wait.  And wait.

I too am mad that they don't have the 5900 blu ray player and they can't even tell you when they are going to get more in or if they ever will get more in. This is bad business. They should offer you a different model blue ray player as a substitute. Why can't they give you the c6800 blu ray player instead? It sells for about the same price. I chatted with customer service about that and all they could tell me is to place my order when the blu ray player comes back into stock. What good is the 30 day money back guarantee if you can't test the 3d functions of the set because you don't have the blu ray player. What happens if I think that ghosting is terrible in 3D after I get the blu ray player and its too late to return the tv? Why bother offering the promotion if it isn't available because they don't have the blu ray player in stock. I went to purchase the TV from PC Richards and I asked them to match Amazon's price. They wouldn't match the price because they said that the promotion from Amazon wasn't valid, since they didn't have the blu ray player in stock. I also saw some other internet company giving you an option on the blu ray player promotion offering you the c6800 player for $21.00 extra instead of having to take the C5900 player.
