{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome TV for the Price!", "Author": "Jonathan Sturak", "ReviewID": "R1Q1765670TMP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was shopping for an HDTV for a few months before I decided to buy this 60\" Mitsubishi 60638. I was torn between the 55\" Toshiba 55G300U LCD, 73\" Mitsubishi 73C9 DLP, and this model (60638). After researching these sets, I decided to buy the 60638 based mainly on its cheap price. There were limited specs available as it's a brand new model, but after hooking it up in my room, I am solely impressed by its size and quality. It is truly a great TV. I had a 2005 62\" Toshiba 62HM195 DLP for two years and this new Mitsubishi looks sharper and more color rich. But there are some cons. For me, they were not deal breakers.PROS:-Cheap price for outstanding image quality and size. Try to find an LCD over 60\" for under a grand!-3 HDMI-3D Ready (haven't used this or plan to use it. I think 3D is still a gimmick)-Relatively lightweight compared to DLP's from a few years ago (my old Toshiba 62HM195 weighed about 30 pounds more)-Freeze Button on remote freezes the image in its current frame. I haven't seen a use for this yet, but it just seems cool-Very simple \"plug-n-play\" ability to get a great calibrated picture right out of the box-In-set speakers are good. The size of the set separates them more than with smaller LCDsCONS:-Lack of inputs! No S-Video! Only 2 component and you have to share these with composite!-No side input for easy access-No universal remote-Lack of fine-tuning controls. A pitiful selection of only Brightness/Contrast/Color/Tint/Sharpness. Forget about fine-tuning tweaking in the more expensive models.-Four image modes that seem to work -- Brilliant (brightest setting), Bright (daytime viewing), Natural (nighttime viewing), Game (adjusts video processing for optimal game playback)2/17/2011 UPDATENew official firmware (v012.01) for the WD-60638 on Mitsubishi's website[...]", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "A simple TV with a strikingly large, good picture", "Author": "Arnold B. Krueger \"Arny Krueger\"", "ReviewID": "R1EZGVICPFW6EO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In its price range, the size and the quality of the picture seems to be far better than average. It works well with indirect or shaded daylight falling on its screen. You'll probably want to back off the as-received brightness and contrast settings to get something a little bit more natural.This is a simplified box with simplified inputs, outputs and controls.Unlike a LCD it is about 16 inches thick and has a projector bulb that you may have to replace during its useful life. It takes a good part of a minute to warm up. It also lacks the complex selective contrast-enhancing features of newer LED LCD TVs. On balance, the basic static contrast is plenty high for all but video perfectionists.It has no analog outputs so that if you want to add an external audio system, that audio system must have a digital (SP/DIF coax) input (stereo), or some kind of time delay to avoid problems with lip synch.The market for this TV is either someone who wants a basic TV with great picture and OK sound, or someone who is willing to provide the technical resources required to incorporate it into a more sophisticated A/V system with a multichannel receiver, etc. The middle ground where you just plug an analog stereo receiver or some powered speakers into it just isn't there.Also lacking are networking and internet support. If you want to watch downloaded videos, you'll need to add a PC to your AV system. The PC-oriented video inputs are HDMI so there's no place to plug in the traditional 15 pin analog CRT connector. Of course doing so would be a waste of a great monitor. A PC with a HDMI or DVI output (with simple adaptor to match the TV's the HDMI inputs) can work well.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV and excellent value!!!", "Author": "sccb85", "ReviewID": "R3AJGO085E3TXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am extremely pleased with this TV. It has an absolutely beautiful picture that is much much more natural than that of a pixel-ated (I think I just made up that word) LCD or a glassy Plasma. Don't get me wrong, I do also like the picture produced by LCD and Plasma TVs, but at the same time you will not find either of those at a 60\" size (or above) for under 1,000$...especially with 24p HD viewing and 120hz refresh. That is why this TV is such an excellent value...you get loads of viewing features standard, along with a HUGE viewing size, for a great price.PROS: 1) the extremely natural picture (after some tweeking of course) 2) the on board speakers are actually pretty good, although I still connected it to my Klipsch surround sound (another highly recommended brand) 3) the automatic connectivity theme makes it very easy to connect and change inputs 4) it's very easy to setup and get the colors right (use the perfectcolor feature) 5) although the screen is huge, while watching shows in HD or Blurays the TV doesn't miss a single pixel, the picture stays smooth and natural (the color is very deep and thorough, but make sure you tweek it right, which is easy to do). Even basic SDTV looks pretty good compared to comparable LCD and Plasma competitors.CONS: 1) THE REMOTE SUCKS (I hate everything about it except the fact that it lights up when pressed) 2) The viewing angle is pretty narrow if you want to keep the picture and color in complete focus. The TV likes to be viewed straight on with a minimum of about 8 feet between you and the TV (although you can see it pretty good at angles that aren't too extreme) 3) it easily catches reflections from lights, windows etc. on it's plexi-screen (although Plasmas do the same thing, in my opinion to a worse amount)4) there is a lack of some inputs (aka S-video) but you can easily buy adapters.ON A SEPARATE NOTE: After having this TV for a few months the input on HDMI 1 started flickering pretty bad. I figured it was my HDMI cable and so I bought another. It did the same thing after a week. So I plugged my original cable into the HDMI 2 input and it worked fine. It seems my HDMI 1 connection is slowing dying on me. I didn't dock any stars for this though because I bought the TV from a man who bought it new and used it 1 month before selling it to me due to lack of finances. Knowing him, I'd say it was probably his fault the connection is shorting out (I checked blogs and haven't found any other problems along this line). He probably tried to connect a USB cable into the HDMI input or something stupid like that. Anyway, I only need 2 HDMI inputs anyway so everything worked out fine...there wasn't any reason to dock any stars ;-)OVERALL: This TV is easily the best buy for ANY set under 1,000$...and I'd say even up to 1,200-1,300$. If you have the ample wall space to allow this huge set to sit, I guarantee you won't be dissapointed.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice for the Price", "Author": "seeker1026 \"Terry\"", "ReviewID": "R22KWOOT5GH741", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this perticulartv and I was very interrested in the 3D capability.I got the starter packet and at first I was gonna send it back, but after I wired it the right way.

This seems to suggest that the larger models in these series many not be as bright as the smaller setsAnd what about 3D? Well, this is an area in which these Mitsubishi DLP 3D TVs excel. Partly, the reason is the sheer size of the TV screen which helps towards achieving a more realistic and immersive 3D viewing experience. But DLPs are also much faster display devices than LED LCD TVs; this helps towards achieving a 3D image that is practically free from 3D image crosstalk - much better than that found on 3D LED LCD TVs.Image crosstalk in 3D viewing is a phenomenon where a subtle washed-out image intended for the right eye appears as a halo around the image intended for the left eye and vice versa. This affects the 3D image detail - leading to a subtle double image effect that may at times become annoying with some 3D content. In the worst case, it may even cause eye fatigue.Plush 1080p: This is Mitsubishi's way of upscaling lower-resolution signals to 1080p for a better image. However, more than an enhancement, this is necessary with all DLP HDTVs in a similar manner to what we find on plasma and HDTVs. These fixed-resolution displays have to convert the incoming signal resolution to the display device native resolution - which in the case of these Mitsubishi DLP TVs, corresponds to that of the 1080p image produced by the DLP imager chip.6-Color Video Processing, whereby apart from the red, green, and blue, the video processing extracts the three secondary colors (cyan, yellow, magenta) to individually process each color; coupled with Mitsubishi six-segment color wheel, the result is greater color accuracy, whiter whites and a wider range of color.Comprehensive connectivity: 3 HDMI with Deep Color technology and including support for PC connectivity via HDMI, PC/DVI audio input, 2 component video inputs whose Y (green) input also serves as a shared composite video input, digital and analog stereo output, and a 3D glasses emitter port which in the case of the entry-level series connects to the 3D adaptor box. What is missing is a USB port; the one provided is only used for servicing.Deep Color technology - aimed at maximizing high definition color performance by creating smoother transitions between different shades,120Hz Sub-frame-rate: This is often being confused by many with what Mitsubishi refers to as Smooth 120 - which works in conjunction with the film mode to reduce motion blur in action scenes. Instead, 120Hz sub-frame refers to the wobulation 120z sub-frame process necessary to generate the full 1920 x 1080 frame 60 times a second from the 960 x 1080 pixel DLP imager chip used on these Mitsubishi DLP TVs.In other words, these are not 120Hz HDTVs in a similar manner to LCDs as some may interpret this rather 'gray' spec. It just means that these Mitsubishi DLP TVs generate 120 sub-frames per second each of which contains half the pixel data of a full 1080p frame in order to generate the 60 full 1080p frames every second.Energy Star 4.0 compliant: All sets except the 60-inch models are Energy Star 4.0 compliant. However, these are still among the most energy efficient HDTVs when considering the screen sizes involved here. In fact, all entry-level Mitsubishi DLP TVs use of the same 156 watts lamp and are rated at 212 Watts. The latter is practically the same power consumption of a properly calibrated 2010 2D 50-inch plasma TV; a 3D 50-inch plasma equivalent would use significantly more.Frame-Freeze Function: Accessible direct from the TV remote (either via the Freeze button or in the case of 738 and 838 series, via the Pause button), this feature is similar to the frame freeze function found on LG HDTVs. It lets you freeze the current TV frame say during a commercial to take note of a telephone number, etc.User Settings: These HDTVs come with four picture modes (Brilliant, Bright, Natural, and a Game mode) but otherwise, what you get is a rather reduced set of user-adjustable picture controls. However, all A/V adjustments have independent memory per input; this greatly eases optimization of picture parameters for different connected devices. In addition, all important picture adjustments are there; these include brightness, contrast, color saturation, tint (to adjust the ratio of green to red), sharpness, noise reduction, and a basic high-low temperature setting. There is also a film mode for 24p content with 480i and 1080i signals, a screen saver feature, and eight aspect ratio settings for handling of 4:3 and 16:9 sources.Audio comes in the form of 10W per channel stereo; sound quality is much better than what you find on flat-panel HDTVs - however, a separate sound system is generally required for best results in which case you have the option to switch off the TV sound to use the external speakers.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great value for 60\" - if you're sitting in the right place", "Author": "HenryTen", "ReviewID": "R335BMAKCCSG29", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For $599 (including shipping and tax and help setting up) this was an unbelievable value. At a thousand bucks (which is the current price at this writing), not so much.  The viewing angle is fairly critical - not too high, not too low and definitely not too far off vertical axis. Features are basic. But the picture is excellent and for basic big screen viewing, it's a good deal at the right price._________________________July, 2011: After six months, I would add a couple of notes: The value is definitely superb for the right consumer.The sound is unimpressive. On axis, the picture is outstanding. But the vertical axis is fairly critical unless you have some distance (maybe ten feet) from the set. In other words, if you are standing (not sitting) within seven feet of the set, picture brightness may fall off, depending on your height. Horizontal axist is somewhat less critical but this set is NOT SUITABLE for a wide, shallow room.You should definitely research DLP sets to understand these limitations before buying. They are remarkably light, but quite deep compared to other flatscreens and cannot, to the best of my knowledge, be wall mounted.If you are not aware of the limitations, take my four stars with caution. If you know exactly what you're getting, then the value boosts it to four or even five stars for the thrifty viewer with the correct room configuration.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV compared to some double the price!", "Author": "Nick Smith", "ReviewID": "ROWW9YI7U43OI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My fiance bought this TV on Amazon a few days ago, we got the email saying it shipped and 3 days later it was delivered right to out door.

Putnam\"", "ReviewID": "R2U6EXTNMQE6A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, let me say that there are three late-model Mitsubishi televisions in my home.  All have great pictures, as almost every other reviewer has stated.  With that said, let me review the 60 incher identifying two weaknesses that might help someone in making a more educated buying decision.  The details that I am about to share might come as a surprise so someone who is considering this television.Issue One: If this television is not going to sit inside an entertainment center...perhaps you are considering putting it on a table, be forewarned that the fan that cools the bulb in this unit is noisy!  Most late-model televisions have small enclosed fans.  While this fan is enclosed, it is not small by comparison.  It hums like a room fan.  Solution?  Turn-up the volume.  This was not something I could have anticipated as the other two televisions in my home are in \"cubbies\" and the fan noise isn't really an issue.Issue Two:  The speakers in this television suck.  Solution? Buy an external soundbar speaker.  Wait...not so fast!  I ordered two different sound bar speakers trying to get each of them  to work with this TV.  Why?  Because this television only has a digital audio out jack (coax).  Both speaker systems required typical RCA or optical input; neither of which this television has.  Solution?  Buy a powered, Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) for about $60.00 (Don't bother looking at Radio Shack, Wal-Mart or anywhere else local for this.  It is an online only thing).  This allowed me to go from digital audio, to the converter, to the speaker.  Now, the sound is great.  Just took more effort than I expected it to.  Incidentally, the speaker I ended up keeping was the Hitachi Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer.  I picked it up at Sam's Club. Stay away from the Visio soundbar.All of my televisions are great.  I hope Mitsubishi continues to embrace this technology and support it.

I actually nabbed this for UNDER $600 but they generally can be found for around $700 if you look around. This is my second Mitsubishi and both TVs have been great. You do sacrifice a few things when purchasing this TV like only 2 non HDMI inputs (most devices offer HDMI so this may not really be a concern) and the sound is average BUT the picture more than makes up for it. Running non-1080p video on this still looks good despite the large size but once you pop a Blu Ray in (via HDMI)... you enter a whole new world. Sure you can find a TV for about the same price with similar picture quality and somewhat better sound but it will be something in the 40-47\" range (unless you are looking at a lower quality offbrand 50\"+ TV that will have issues in the long run) but THIS TV is one of the best 50\"+ 1080P TVs you will find under $1000.

Setup is easy, the instruction manual is well written and illustrated.  The screen is a matte (non-glare) finish.After about a 1-minute warmup period (something which many people don't like) the picture is extremely bright. The 60638 offers four base-configuration settings, all of which can be tweaked in seven ways.My TV room has indirect light most of the time and I had to lower the contrast to create a pleasant setting.

The sound was good--decent bass for small speakers with clear midrange/highs.* There is a single optical output to send to your 5.1 receiver, so the 60638 itself becomes your HDMI switcher--very handy if you have an older unit.* There are no S-Video inputs, so older VCR or DVD players must use a yellow (composite) RCA cable in one of the 3 \"composite\" inputs--weird arrangement. The tuner is first-rate. From 55 miles away, I can pick up all local stations using a Terk HDTVa-Indoor antenna.The only cautionary notes I would mention are:*  1.) **Always plug the 60638 into a UPS**. The DLP projector will have a very short life if you \"pull the plug\" or experience power outages.  Even if you turn it off properly, you must wait a couple minutes before turning it back on, similar to an overhead projector.*  2.) Have a technician set up/adjust the geometry while it's under warranty. If you know what you're doing, you can download the Service Manual and do it yourself using the supplied remote control--but I warn you--it's tricky. Even then, it may not adjust to studio perfection, so that's why it's best to do it while you can still get Mits to service it.Lastly, this set is not a 120HZ when in 3D-mode, it is 60Hz/eye. Frankly, I don't really care for the \"ironed out\" video look that new 240Hz sets do to most shows. To tell you the truth, I think the 60638 delivers a more realistic picture, MUCH more like the experience in a movie theater.Enjoy!", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture, outstanding value", "Author": "Padfoot", "ReviewID": "RX8U1C2FXW3FS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son bought this TV 6 months ago, which we got to enjoy for the summer before he left for college. I had to go back to our old 32\" CRT TV. Thankfully, this TV came up for sale during Black Friday. It wasn't my first choice as I wanted an LCD, but I am glad I got this one!PROs:- Value: You get a lot of HD picture for your dollar and I mean a lot! Nothing else comes close.- Picture quality: On HD channels, picture is stunning. Sharp, crisp, clear. You're given the option of setting picture brightness through the remote. I have found brilliant to be best. Others complaining about picture quality may need to adjust the resolution which is also adjusted through the remote. My factory setting was at 480 widescreen which will be grainy on this size of a TV. By stepping through the various options for each pixel concentration (480, 720, 1080) you can settle on 1080 original format which provides your HD resolution. You should keep in mind that your nonHD channels or DVDs will look a little grainy. This is true for any HD TV. But those true HD channels are absolutely beautiful. You'll see what you have been missing. As for viewing angle, I really don't see an issue. We can view across a 90 degree arc. I would hate to watch any TV from a sharp angle.- Remote: Setup was very intuitive. I didn't even open the manual.- Options: You're given 3 HDMI inputs which I filled with Direct TV, BluRay DVD player, and a Roku video streamer (for Netflix). I wish it had 4 inputs but I can't complain. You can do Netflix through XBOX, Wii, and PS3 so 3 HDMIs should really be enough.- Sound: Sound is good, not great. For TV speakers, it's actually pretty good. Obviously, if you want to enjoy a rich deep movie sound experience, add a surround sound system.- General: It's light. I lifted it onto our TV stand by myself. It's about 65 pounds.CONs:- Takes about 20 seconds for the bulb to warm up for a brilliant picture.- I have read that the bulb will last about 3600 hrs (~2yrs) on the brilliant setting; longer if you use the standard brightness. You may get 8 yrs out of an LED TV lamp. So, I'm looking at buying 4 lamps over the life of the TV at ~$100 per lamp. I think this is still a reasonable cost compared to a 60\" LED TV that pushes into several thousand dollars. Also, keep in mind that it is easy to replace a projection TV bulb. Not so on an LCD or LED TV.You won't go wrong purchasing this TV.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV from every angle", "Author": "J.B.", "ReviewID": "R2Q2LDSAD8H5HD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Mitsubishi 60\" DLP TV through Amazon and thought I would share my thoughts, as I was reading multiple reviews before I made my purchase.  I thought I might help others whom are considering the same choices:Here are my thoughts on picture quality:Excellent-  The colors are very rich, and show nuance I have not seen on my previous Plasma 720P TV.  The viewing angles did not show any darkening from side to side beyond any angle that would be practical to watch the TV(well to the side and a few feet back).  The blacks did not seem \"weak\", nor particularly strong.  I anticipated this might be a weakness, but it was really unnoticeable in one direction or the other.  Generally, speaking the very large screen, and HD together make for a \"feel like you are there\" experience.  I watched a a 55\" LED, 120HZ tv beforehand and then watched this TV.  Strictly, speaking I would not say that one technology looked better than the other.  I think the color reproduction is probably a little better on the DLP, and the blacks and contrast are a little better on the LED, but in a picture quality comparison, I would say they were about equal.  In short, very nice top of the line HD viewing.  (The picture was perfectly tuned for viewing as delivered, I did play with adjustments (tint, sharpness, etc.).  In the end I liked the settings as delivered.  I have only watched HD content so far.Here are my thoughts on sound:I thought the sound was fairly standard, and didn't see anything especially good or bad.  The volume raises and lowers with content nicely, and was about the same as what I would have expected.Here are my thoughts on Size, Weight, Connections and Start-Up:The TV is about what what I expected in terms of depth, but also surprisingly light.  I had no problems moving it with a friend without straining.  I do not see any negatives (unless you need to mount a TV on the wall), regarding the size and weight.  The TV does take a few seconds to start-up, after being turned on, and is slower with changing channels than the plasma I had.  These effects are not very noticeable or annoying when using the TV, as far as operation goes, but they are there.  There are 3 HDMI connections, which are perfect for me, and setup was easy.Summary:  In general, I think this TV was an excellent value and has picture quality on par with the LED and Plasma TV's I have experience with.  I have had the TV for a couple of days, and am very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Can't Beat The Price...", "Author": "Dan D \"Danny D\"", "ReviewID": "RQRWQK4ORBT0Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got my 60 inch Mitsubishi today! Delivery was good, no problems. The TV is light. It only weighs 60 lbs out of the box.The TV is good... Not great, but good. My PS3 Blu Ray looks good after some tweaking. I have HDMI running from both my computer and my PS3, so I still have one HDMI input left not being used.I got this TV for $700 with tax and shipping, and for that price you really can't beat it. The TV is HUGE. The viewing angle is not the greatest, but doing any reseach into a DLP and you should see that coming. If it's just a few people you aren't going to be sitting too far on the side anyways, so it isn't an issue for me. Also, you have to be right eye level with the TV. If it's too high or too low, you lose a ton of the picture. It works pretty well in a highly lit room, but it definitely shines in a dark area.The bulb replacement isn't a huge deal with me. I had a projector before this, so I've bought them before. You spend an extra $125 every year or two, but when you put the new bulb in it looks like a brand new TV... Plasmas and LEDs fade over time, and once it's done it's done. Also, there is a slot right on the back of the TV for the new bulb, so it's not like you are tearing apart the TV to get to the bulb.Overall, if you are looking for size with decent clarity, you can't beat it for under a grand. If you are looking for the best TV on the market, go elsewhere... I was looking at a 50 inch Samsung for $2,200...

Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R1YYVR7D5DEVXY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had purchased the 82\" version of this Mitsubishi DLP tv two years ago from Costco. Unfortunately, Costco no longer carries this brand or similar models. My older Hitachi 55' TV has been steadily declining (bought in 2003) so I've ben looking around to purchase another Mitsubishi DLP unit. Well, just last weekend I saw Amazon had one for an amazing price of $ 550.00, and jumped on it. Iy was delivered today via private express. The deliveryman even brought it into my library for me, which is behind our main house.I'm now busily connecting the following to it: old Laserdisc player, (I know they're antiquated, but I have about 350-400 movies and related media and the picture quality is astounding), a blue-ray player (with internet connection for Netflix),  a Wii game (for our grandsons), and a SONY audio amplifier and speakers. Since I use this unit a lot for business, preparing public presentations, creating video for projects and family, (I recently prepared a video of my niece's wedding), I usually have the set on while working or studying to keep abreast of what's going on in the world - (event though at times maybe I should be using it for entertainment purposes instead). It might be more interesting and a lot less disheartening.Anyway, this Mitsubishi TV has an excellent picture, and is quite simple to use. It even has a game setting to better create a hightened gamer experience. (Think I'll not tell the grandsons about that).I highly recommend this as your primary or secondary TV if you, like me, want excellent quality at an affordable price. My personal feeling is that retail prices on too many things are exorbitantly high anyway.

The TV picture is excellent, and doesn't have the 'soap opera effect' i was expecting with a 120 Hz TV.  The TV is surprisingly light given the size, though I still had to get a new entertainment center due to the size.  The 3D on the TV is fantastic and immersive.  The only issue with the 3D is that the glasses sometimes \"de-synch\" causing flickering contrast (no effect on quality of the image), and the TV needs to be shut off and on again.  This may be due to the glasses, though I'm not sure; and this issue doesn't happen all the time.  The speaker quality isn't great, and there's no audio optical out; but I use my AVR with the system.  Other cons are that the remote control is not great, updating software needs to be done via USB, and there's only 3 HDMI inputs.  Also, be sure to purchase the 3DA1 3D converter or the 3D won't work.  Also, you will need Mitsubishi compatible glasses and an emitter for the glasses.  Don't let the cons sway you from purchasing this TV.  I am very happy with the TV, and would highly recommend it to everyone.

The TV depth when compared to an LCD on a stand is very similar. The LCD, LED or plasma gain the depth advantage when wall mounted. Picture quality is excellent in this TV as well as my previous purchases. I have had little to no trouble with each purchase (especially since they upgraded to a color wheel instead of the old tech color guns) I paid $1099 in Oct 2010 which is $200 more than the current price. This is the best time of year to purchase any TV (just prior to the Super Bowl) as prices will never be lower. This TV was purchased for a friend who could not wait 3 months, after I demonstrated my 73\" and 65\" models. The sound is above average for a large screen since it is a dlp and ther is more room  for larger speakers vs a flat screen. I never use the TV speakers in my systems because ther is no comparison when an AV receiver and after market speakers are added as part of the system. My friend is elderly and was not interested in a sound system for this TV until I demonstrated that about 90% of the sound would come from just the Center channel. I will purchase a used (5-10 yr old) 5.1 AV receiver (many on Ebay for less than $100) and 1 used Center channel speaker to greatly enhance his sound quality. If he wants better sound, I will then suggest a sub to pick up the low frequences the center channel cannot provide. It is very inexpensive to drastically improve your sound (without filling the room with speakers by simply adding a Center Channel and Sub. If you are looking for a big screen TV, I would highly recommend this model. I have not seen anything close in value. I am not running any 3D material on my TV's but I have seen a demo and it looked very good.Cons: My friend and I both use DirecTV. My DirecTV remotes will turn on both the TV and SAT Reciever when the remote is switched to Direct TV. I do not need to switch the remote to TV to turn it on and off. The DirecTV remote will not turn on both the SAT reciever and TV with the push of one button. You must switch the remote to TV in order to power it up or down.

I'd been wanting to get a large screen TV for probably the past 10 years but never had the money. I saw the price and couldn't pass it up. I haven't been disappointed. It has a great picture, bright colors, extremely clear sound, and easy controls. Originally, I figured if it was a dud, it wasn't much more for it than a smaller TV. I'm notorious for buying TVs that don't live up to expectations, but this isn't one of them.It's actually pretty light for the size. The hold-back is that it's bulky. It takes two people to move it, but I wouldn't do it any other way. I would get a pretty large stand or one that's made for it. Make sure it's stable. It's pretty easy to tip, and that'd be an expensive mistake.I'm not technologically literate. I fumble and know a little, but I'm by no means an expert at electronic connections. This was pretty easy to set up. I had a little trouble trying to set it up with cable not through a cable box. I had the box on another TV at the time. After I moved the box to it, there wasn't a problem. I'm sure it was me and not the TV, though.We got a surround sound system to go with the TV. Despite the good sound that the TV has, we wanted more power and output. The TV has a little trouble recognizing the receiver or the receiver has a little trouble sending info to the TV. I don't know if it's me, the receiver, or the TV. It just takes a little time for everything to begin communicating. I've been dealing with it, but I'm going to start troubleshooting it and see if I can figure out how everything will turn on at the same time rather than taking a few minutes for everything to recognize each other. Recently, we got a DVR from the cable company. When connected directly to the TV, it takes a few seconds to connect and works fine. When connected through the receiver, it takes 30 minutes for everything to begin working. So, I'm thinking the receiver is the problem.We can connect the laptop to the TV. It, again, takes a few minutes to recognize the laptop resolution (when connected directly to the TV), but Mitsubishi put a notice in the manual informing the purchaser that it won't work with certain resolutions. It takes time, but it works.Overall, this is a fantastic TV. It's not as slim, but that's okay. It's not heavy, and it works well. Definitely worth the purchase.

I like that I can look online and get my manual for the tv, too.There are some things that I have struggled with, and overall I still LOVE this tv and think it is well worth the money, but the issues I have had are as follows: -Not flat, can't hang or mount the tv to a wall. -Sound isn't great -Viewing from a downward angle: I can't lay on the floor and watch tv with the same quality as straight on. I also purchased a tv stand that was too tall, and this accentuated this issue. -The ports are pretty limited: We have a wii, a blue-ray player, a media center, and a sound bar. The blue-ray player and the media center both use hdmi ports and they were easy enough. The sound bar only connects to one spot, and it is not well labeled, the same goes for the wii, but to a lesser degree. Because of that we struggled to hook up both items. Once they were added they were fine and work well.Overall I love the tv, I love the color and contrast, REALLY love the price, and find everything else tolerable.  The quality is good, and since it isn't and LCD tv, there isn't the issue of a bulb going out and the whole thing being garbage.The remote is a big plus to me, it is a really nice programmable remote.

I paid less than $800 and the major retailer (rhymes with Guest Guy) also threw in an Insignia Wireless BluRay player with the deal - yowza!!The picture quality is amazing, as good as anything else I've seen and better than many.  The colors are well-saturated, blacks are truly black, unlike most LCDs, and the whites are sparkling.  The SuperBowl looked fabulous, it's almost like being at the game except I don't have to worry about some loud-mouthed drunk hootin' and hollerin' all game long and no one to spill beer on me <g>!!As mentioned by many, the sound quality is just so-so.  But anyone who doesn't know that most every TV available has mediocre sound is just not on the ball.  I have a very nice surrpound sound system and this set makes for a very nice centerpiece for that.  And folks, if you're buying a set of this size and calibre, *why* would you cheap-out and use the TV's speakers?  Do yourself a BIG favor and spring for a decent home theater setup with the money you saved by not buying a $2,500 plasma.  At worst, get a decent soundbars and a small subwoofer, you'll only have to pay $600 - $800 for something like that and the sound quality will be worthy of the set's picture quality.And I found the available picture-setting controls quite adequate for dialing-in an outstanding picture.  Skin tones are spot-on.  The grass on the football fields looks like grass should.  AstroTurf looks like AstroTurf. And blue skies are pitcure perfect.

This TV replaced our 17+ year old 45\" Mitsubishi which was still going strong and had never had a single problem (we never even had to replace the bulb!).  Our old 45\" Mitsubishi cost over $2000 at the time!  We're very happy that Mitsubishi made the decision to keep developing DLP technology while others tossed it aside, as this new TV is outstanding and cannot be beat for the price.  The 3D picture is excellent and deep, and Blu-ray and HD satellite are great as well.  The color is outstanding and very, very rich.  The blacks are very good as well, and the set-up was easy.  We can't imagine ever needing a screen larger than 60\" and being on a tight budget we also can't imagine a better choice for the years to come.

I guess it was worth the 400 but it's a shame this tv is popping up white dots now every day. Also black dots which were tolerable but the bright white ones you can't take your eyes off of them.

The remote is kinda crappy, the interface is kind of moody. it does not have any old style  rca video inputs (for the yellow white and red cable).I bought it from a low-life seller on here that has a no return policy! dont make that same mistake, buy from amazon only! I lost my tv low price gaurantee because I unknowingly bought from a 3rd party seller! I think they deleted my original review because I named names, lets just say their name starts with an M.this was a nitemare order for me, I paid $999 for this thing, a week later it was going for $599! Nobody cared and so I lost about 400 bux on that deal.then after I bought it I asked them about getting a deal on a 3d kit from them, they were trying to sell me one for $350. Little did I know that during this time when I bought it, mitsubishi was offering a FREE 3d kit deal! I could of gotten it free! im certain the seller jerks KNEW that but didnt want to tell me that, cause they wanted to sell me one instead! plus amazon didnt even advertise this offer either! i literally found out the day after it expired that I could of gotten it! I called and pleaded with mitsubishi to let me still get the free kit, but they still refused. So im done with this seller, and Im done with mitsubishi. I did boycott amazon for a while too, but instead of boycotting I just returned a big bunch of stuff I had ordered from them recently.so the bottom line, the tv is average at best and I got totally ripped off. instead of paying 600 for this tv and a 3d kit, ill end up paying 1400 instead, if i ever buy a 3d kit! im so furious, sickened, and hurt.I still dont even know if the 3d kit works.

It is better to have a small quality TV than a larger one that's blurry. It's definitely not cinema quality, or 720p for that better in detail.
