Like someone else said, the bezel is very thin, so the picture seems very large. I followed CajunJake's advice and ordered a $25. Cheetah wall mount. That came first and I installed in 15 minutes. When the TV came (quickly) I opened the box, put it in the wall mount, and turned it on. I was watching it immediately, and made no adjustments at all. The remote is easy to use. I'm not a techie at all and hate messing around with something to get it to work. This was fine for me, right out of the box.It has the usual inputs - audio/video, HDMI, USB and optical audio input.It has AV inputs and outputs, including one RF In for antenna or cable inputs, one AV In for audio and video input, two component inputs (one on the side and one on the rear of the television), one USB connector, one digital video out, one RS-232 connection, and one headphone output.The USB has limited use in that with other LG models one can insert a flash drive containing a movie and the LG plays the movie... but not with this model.. only view pictures and play music.. no movies... you need to run movies through a DVD or your computer..No VGA, but it has two HDMI and one USB port. Use the HDMI port from my laptop for connecting to the TV.It does not have an analog RCA output, but does have a digital optical output.Also has a sleep timer.The picture quality is excellent, and the sound is great, too. I like it so well, I'm ordering another one for a different room, before the price goes up.ETA - 4/28/2014 I've had this 9 months now, and haven't had any problems. I bought a second one, and it's great, too. Great value for the price.The TV does not come with an HDMI cable, but the Cheetah mount I bought does have one included.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "As always, LG delivers!", "Author": "Ranger \"Happy Retiree\"", "ReviewID": "R38EMF92L3IAEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LG has come through again!  I already have a 42\" LCD HDTV and wanted a smaller one for my \"man cave\".  Of course I ordered from Amazon and it arrived right on time, as always is the case with Amazon.  This 32\" model delivers a HD picture using the entire screen.  LG's are the easiest on the market to set up every single adjustment you might want to make.  This one is a little newer, and has even more adjustments.  If you click 4 for channel 4, it offers 5 other options of the over the air numbers, 4.1, 4.2, etc!  I love it and will buy any product available made by LG.  This company has proven it over and over.  You won't be sorry!", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent 720p television for the price!", "Author": "Paul S. Remington", "ReviewID": "RH13PC3R55VIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LG 32LN53OB is a 32\" LED television designed for those who are satisfied with 720p video output without the 1080p price.  It contains a nice selection of built-in features and picture modes and is Energy Star compliant.  Its price point is a nice selling feature, but this doesn't detract from its video performance, which is respectable.  With all this stated, the LG 32LN53OB is a lower scale television in terms of video specifications.  If you're in the market for a 720p, lower priced television, the LG 32LN53OB is certainly worth looking at.The LG 32LN53OB screen measures 31.5\" diagonally.  It has a refresh rate of 60 Mhz with video processing that enhances video performance.  60 MHz is fine for slower moving video, but will result in pixelization during fast action scenes.  To add to video performance, LG has incorporated its Triple XD Engine, which provides video deinterlacing, color and contrast enhancements, and video noise reduction.  This adds to the overall image quality.The 32LN53OB comes with seven picture modes that preset different video aspect ratios.  These presets enable 16:9 widescreen imaging without any scaling.  This preserves the sharpness of the original video signal, which can be degraded during scaling.  Other aspect ratios are supported by internal scaling, which enables these video modes to utilize as much of the screen as possible.To assist in setting up the television, LG has supplied a Picture Wizard that assists in configuring critical settings that control picture quality.  These settings include adjustments to black level, white level, color, color tint, horizontal sharpness, and vertical sharpness.  These are all easily set using the Picture Wizard in only a few minutes.The 32LN53OB supports a number of AV inputs and outputs, including one RF In for antenna or cable inputs, one AV In for audio and video input, two component inputs (one on the side and one on the rear of the television), one USB connector, one digital video out, one RS-232 connection, and one headphone output.As is typical with LED televisions, the audio quality is not its most impressive feature, although it does a very nice job.  Many televisions are a bit anemic in their audio output.  Not with this LG television.  The 32LN53OB comes with two 10W speakers that provide a nice volume depth.  If you want to listen to the news while in the next room, you'll have no problem increasing the volume to a level that enables you to do that comfortably.  Some televisions provide only a 3W speaker, which doesn't provide enough power to fill up more than a room's worth of volume.  While the television provides a nice amount of volume, don't expect it to deliver grinding bass or nice low end.  For that, you'll want to install an A/V system with larger speakers.Power consumption is quite modest with this television, which has earned it an Energy Star rating.  It consumes a scant 28.9W of power during typical use.  Standby mode uses only .3W.The 32LN53OB comes with a swivel stand, a standard remote, two AA batteries for the remote, and a one-year parts and labor warranty.The 32LN53OB is a very good 32\" LED television, for the money.  It contains the right amount of features and performance to satisfy most consumers who are looking for a basic television at a nice price.  It doesn't natively support 1080p video reproduction, but the video processors within the television do a nice job of hosting 1080 content.  The television also offers a very nice array of features and connectivity options, which makes the 32LN53OB a viable option for a variety of applications.Overall, the LG 32LN53OB is a nice television worth considering for those looking at 720p LED televisions.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good...", "Author": "E.

I have been pleasantly surprised with LG brands. I had a great cell phone from them and now after testing their product out, the clarity and sturdiness of the products is good branding. I wanted a good TV for my PS3 so I could play my Skyrim video game, I can actually read the signs on the game when my character is running down the roads on the game! Fantastic compared to the last 32\" TV I bought last year that blew a fuse within the 90 days. I am watching this Netlix show and I am just amazed with the clarity. Great gaming, Netflix, Youtube viewing and...the sound is great for a small bedroom (I'm on a lower setting for the room 14 level and it's not even a quarter up the volume level).

I have toyed around in the past by purchasing 3 cheap Flat panel TV's from best buy (two Insignia's (24 and 32 inch) and 1 Dynex (26 inch) thinking that all \"cheap\" TV's would be on par with each other. This LG costs about $50 more than a comparable 32 inch Insignia, however, I believe the cost difference is well worth the money.The cheap Insignia's and the Dynex have issues with the HD tuner - they always have issues whenever I turn to a HD Channel - I normally need to go up or down one station, and manually turn back to the station that I want to get a signal lock, then, once s a signal lock is obtained, I will usually lose that station after about 30 minutes - these issues are NOT present on the LG.Pro's of LG over cheap brands:  - Better picture quality;  - Better HD tuner  - Better Build qualityCon's: About $50 more than a comparable el cheapo TV (however, in my opinion it appears the extra money is worth it)This TV is recommended if you are in the market for a \"basic features\" 32 inch TV (this TV is a \"no frills\" model).

Yes I said 5 year old Vizio. Anyhow when we started shopping for a TV this one made the short list a long aside a Sony Bravia, and Toshiba. This TV got slightly better reviews and was in the same price range as the other two. The main appeal to this TV was the smaller sized frame. However the picture is incredibly beautiful and crystal clear. The one feature that is taking me time to adjust to (and it can be turned off) is the way the TV will adjust to the amount of light in the room. I am a night owl so I am usually up later than my wife. When all the lights are out in the bedroom the TV becomes very dim which is good for my wife because the light doesn't keep her awake - however the dimmer screen does take a little time to get used to. If you don't like this feature you can shut it off in the menu. I read the remote was hard to work with - I have not experienced this at all. For the price and what we were looking for it's perfect.So far I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a good quality fairly priced 720p TV for their bedroom, kids room, or where ever.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very surprised and happy with this TV!", "Author": "Alex Bruno", "ReviewID": "R15JS2242BN7G6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was nervous when ordering this TV because everyone always finds something negative with anything they buy and I didn't want to be bothered returning a TV. I myself am not a videophile, so the highest of quality isn't a huge deal for me. I absolutely LOVE this TV. For a lower end model with no frills, I think it's absolutely perfect. Upon watching a show on Netflix, I will admit it is a little darker than I'd like, but once I switched it from eco to standard, the color looked good. Sound seems to be a huge issue for people with lower end TVs and I think the speakers on this one are pretty loud and I'm satisfied with them.My only complaint is the stand is slightly difficult to put together and screw into the TV. YOu have to really twist hard on the screwdriver, (unless you have a drill). Also, the TV feels a little shaky in the stand, but upon checking other TVs in the house, of all different brands, that seems to be common with these stands.All in all I'm very satisfied with this television, and if it doesn't break randomly for no reason in the near future, I'll definitely buy LG again!", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "D.

It is a 720p / 60Hz LED TV at a great price from LG. So, the 4 star rating reflects what it is as a TV.  If you were expecting perfection, you should spend at least twice as much and get a 1080p / 120Hz.As a bedroom TV (which is what I bought it for), it is 5 stars.  Two HDMI ports, great color, good clarity, good sound, ease of set up, time on/off settings, great price/value, delivered to my door by Amazon and backed by Amazon return policy, LG warranty and Square Trade warranty (extra cost).  It is interesting that on the LG site this is described as a bedroom TV.  LG knows best!The cons are:  1.  Motion blurring.  If this was my primary TV for watching sports action, I probably would choose to spend more for 120Hz.  At 60Hz blurring occurs.  Eventually the brain gets in sync and you can watch sports without this being an irritant.  It just takes a few minutes.  For casual watching of routine TV viewing, it is fine.  2.  Field of View.  Within about 15-20 degrees on either side of straight on viewing, the picture is perfect.  Move further left or right from this and the color starts to fade and becomes white.  For perspective,  if you have a couch positioned eight feet away directly in front of the TV, anyone sitting on the couch will have the best picture.  Imagine the cone created from the center of the TV to the ends of the couch.  Anyone viewing outside of this cone will have a diminished picture.  All of these measurements are approximate and you can position the TV to maximize viewing based on audience placement.Make sure you use an HDMI cable from the cable box to the TV.  I tried it first with a regular cable and the HD picture was comparable to the picture on the analog TV being replaced.  Got an HDMI cable free from my cable provider, and the HD picture changed to amazing.Would I buy it again knowing its limitations?  Absolutely!  It is great price/value.Update after 3 months use.  I find I prefer this TV now over others in the house.  The picture viewed straight on is incredible.  Vivid, consistent, true color is its strength.  Also, the picture is crisp, consistently showing a pleasing picture and showing background detail not found on my other HDTV's.  As to the motion blurring - either the TV has gotten better processing motion or the brain has gotten better at processing because I no longer notice it.  I would give this a 4.5 rating after using it for 3 months.  The only con being the field of view which continues the same.And for those owners complaining of the TV turning itself off - turn off the power saver option on the TV menu and, if you are using a cable box with a power save option, turn off the power save option on the cable box menu also.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "...

It's a low-end model without any smart features that you might expect from a high-end set, but paired with my Chromecast, it gets the job done, and I feel it was good deal for the money.One drawback I did not realize when I made the purchase: the set is listed as having a USB port, which it does, but it does not support the playback of video files from a flash drive, only image and audio files.  The technical specs on the LG website do, indeed,  list only image and audio formats, unlike the pricier sets, which support DivX, MPEG, etc. This isn't a deal-breaker for me, and it's simple enough to work around, with a laptop connected via HDMI, for example, but I do wish the tech specs made this fact clearer, as I might have considered looking for a set that did have video playback capability.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "BUY THIS TV", "Author": "john", "ReviewID": "R254LR4BQY5OP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I BUY A LOT OF STUFF FROM AMAZON, AND RARELY GIVE REVIEWS, BUT I'M SO PLEASED WITH THIS TV, I AM WRITING ONE NOW.

I wasn't overly happy with either the color or the sound using the default settings on either.  A few trips through the available color and sound choices provided settings that I am very happy with.  The sound quality is far better than I expected.  You don't have to worry about booming base breaking any windows in your house, but the audio is clean and clear.  It even sounds very good when listening to the cable music channels.The only thing that comes close to being a negative point is that the stand seems a bit flimsy.

I was contemplating buying a schmancy TV that had web access, etc, but I'm glad I went with a basic flat screen like this instead.  I just wanted something I can use to flip channels real quick.  This works, pretty much.First, it's cheap.  I spent just over 200 bucks for this I think.  That's $100 more than the older smaller flat screen TV I had in my bedroom which wasn't even HD capable.  So the price is great.Second, the viewing angle is OK.  If you're a stickler for viewing angle, don't get this TV.  Unless you're watching it head-on, as soon as you move to the left or right, the picture dims.  That's annoying.  But, like I said, this is just sitting in the bedroom so that's OK by me.  Also, it was cheap.Third, yes the sound isn't the greatest but - for a bedroom it's fine.  If you're a stickler for awesome sound this is not the TV for you.Fourth, I only needed this to scan and save the channels it picked up from my cable line which it did just fine.  But it organized them in a weird way.  First, it has a bunch of channels labeled \"CATV\" meaning Cable TV I guess.  Those number like 2 - 48.  Then it has some \"CADTV\" or some other label and it's like HD channels from the cable provider.  Those are like 5-101 but they come AFTER the 2-48 mentioned before.  THEN, there's a THIRD category called \"DTV\" or something?  Like digital TV I guess?  Another set of channel numbers.  It also picked up a lot of \"blank\" screens as channels.  I think it picked up the menu options from Time Warner and saved them as channels (101-1, 101-2, etc).  It did pick up a ton of channels, but many of them are these \"blank\" ones.  Plus, it's slow to change channels - I like to flip really quick but you can't do that anymore - these new TVs or even the cable boxes are just slow to do that.  Drives me nuts.But overall I am happy with it. It's nice and big for a bedroom, looks OK, the HD programs look really nice.  Lots of video and sound options.  It's cheap.

Only 1 setback this has is that it doesn't have USB support for video so one can't watch movies using a pen drive or attaching hard drives and 3.5mm audio jack also doesn't work on this.Since I'm in India, I would like to inform buyers from India that it doesn't requires any voltage converter and it can easily hooked up with D2H HD from Videocon through HDMI. I purchased one of the NTSC to Pal Converter which wasn't clear and there were shades and lines in transmission while running local cable connection thus I switched to d2h and picture quality is amazing.Picture quality is amazing, sound is kinda OK, 2 HDMI inputs are sufficient and there's digital audio input too so no old speakers work that are on analog technology if you want sound output on bars but SPDIF (Coax) can be attached to this. Another good feature is energy-saving system this TV has which adjust contrast and brightness according to light in your room and thus saves your electricity by showing desired amount of picture your room ambiance should be having.To summarize in short, I love it and so does my family.

This almost makes me want to cry.  One more HDMI input and I would have been thrilled.Eco settings.  Yeah, it'll save power, but not your eyesight.  You are almost required to remove eco power right out of the gate.  Otherwise the screen is just too dim.  I kept changing the blacklight and brightness settings when I first bought the TV to make the screen brighter, but didn't realize the eco settings were on by default.

Due to this I was ready to return it, but the sound from the built in speakers is decent, and the rest of the TV is so awesome, I will use it as is.You can get an adapter to convert the digital audio to analog for about $35, this requires another plug to power and more cables, etc. My rationale is that this is a basic, low cost TV, so why would LG assume the buyer would have hi end audio.

I did notice, however, that the screen did not have the contact plastic cellophane on the screen typically associated with flat screen tv\u2019s.The return window had already passed by the time I found out the unit was damaged, so a learning experience for me.  I did, however, find out that this is not an uncommon occurrence for items sold through Warehouse Deals, Inc.  Many complaints about their products on the internet.

The breathing issue is still there. Still can't use the #6 button for anything. I I have disabled the \"breathing function\" and yet when I restart my system, there it is. The dpi settings won't stay as set. I waited another 3 weeks to write another review for this mouse. Same issues. I counted the wrong buttons in my first review, the 6 button, sorry my bad. The macro's don't record right. So my conclusion is that: The Software for this product has to be completely redone. A little tip, just like the release of DayZ standalone, Have the people that use it TEST it. Oh and test the mouse on somebody that has bigger hands. My hand spread is from bottom of palm to tip of middle finger 8 inches by 4\" palm. In the future test it more than on smaller hands.
