{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good TV but very clumsy \"Smart\" features & interface", "Author": "Michael Sandman", "ReviewID": "R7UBIRZ8UOFO3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The LG LS5700 is an OK TV.  If I could, I'd give it 2-1/2 stars.  The LS5700's selling point is supposed to be the \"smart\" features that let you connect to the Internet, get content from Netflix, Hulu Plus, etc. and share content from other devices in your network.  It does have a nice crisp HD picture after you tweak the color settings, and so-so sound, as expected.  But if that's all you want in a TV there are less expensive alternatives.  Unfortunately, the interface for using the \"smart TV\" features is very clumsy.  And although the manual does a good job of showing how to connect the TV, it has almost nothing on how to use the \"smart\" features.  The built-in menus are supposed to do that.  The on-screen menus and LG's online support are minimal at best, and just plain wrong in one case (see below).On the plus side, the TV connected easily to my home network, using either WiFi or an Ethernet cable.  And the \"smart\" features do work, if you can stand the interface  However, this is TV is not the user-friendly web-integrated TV I was  hoping for.  That's still some time in the future.The TV includes a remote that's used to access the \"smart\" features and also to set up the TV, connect to your WiFi network, etc.  It has sort of an air mouse pointer that shows up on the screen. When you use features that require entering text, there's an on-screen QWERTY keyboard that you click on with the remote control's pointer.  Using the on-screen keyboard is just plain horrible.  It's very slow and the remote's pointer is slow and somewhat jerky.  If you get into the TV's setup menu you can change the pointer's setting to \"fast\", which helps a bit, but the on-screen keyboard is hopeless.It's not mentioned in the manual, but you can attach a wireless keyboard through a USB port.  That lets you enter text more easily than you can with the on-screen keyboard.  But the wireless mouse that pairs with my new wireless keyboard doesn't work.  LG tech support says the set can take only one user input even though there are three USB ports.  (They responded very quickly -- within hours -- to their credit.)  So you have to use the remote control to do the pointing. What this TV really needs is a remote with a decent pointer and a little pull-out keyboard or a keyboard on the back.  Samsung, Sony and Viszio (among others) do that; I would have been a lot happier with the set if LG did the same thing.There's an iPhone app from LG that could (in theory) make the interface better.  It's supposed to allow you to control the TV from an iPhone. The app doesn't have a keyboard, according to reviews on iTunes, so it's not perfect.  Far worse, although the LG web site specifically mentions that the LS5700 series is compatible with the app, the app doesn't work with this model.  This was confirmed by LG tech support, and the app's information tab has a list of supported models includes the LW5700 series, but not the LS5700 series.To access music, photos or video on your home network using the DLNA capability, you need to download an application from the LG website to your computer.  The TV's setup menu does mention that you need to have media sharing software, but you have to dig deeply into the on-screen menus to find out.Perhaps LG intends to update the iPhone app, or the set's firmware, or offer a compatible remote with a keyboard and a better pointer.  But until then, avoid this model if you want easy-to-use \"smart TV\" features.  The interface on this set is not ready for prime time.

Shumway", "ReviewID": "R29979O7RES62X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this TV because it was the right price with the right set of features. It is getting harder and harder to find TVs that dont have the \"3D\" feature. I just wanted a high quality picture, internet connectivity, and no 3D...it was surprisingly difficult to find. It shouldnt be difficult to find a tv that doesnt boast the \"3D\" with stupid sets of glasses that just make you feel disoriented and ill. I dont need a gimmick, I need a TV.At any rate, the delivery of the tv went smoothly and I was able to schedule a time that worked and it showed up with no real problems. I assembled it and set it up, which wasnt very difficult.The picture on this thing is excellent. I had to adjust brightness, contrast, etc to get it to my liking but that is how it is with every TV.And now, the remote:I dont know what they were smoking when they came up with this thing, but it is the most obnoxious and useless remote I have ever had the misfortune of using. It awkwardly fits in the hand, is shaped like a boat so it always tips over, and the cursor is extremely annoying to use. It is a lot like the wii remotes, but less effective and just as childish.Fortunately, I got a universal remote that works well, so I rarely have to use the horrid thing. They should at least put a real remote in there with the magic one or give us the option of which we would like to go with our TV.Another user review stated that it only works with one USB device and I can confirm this. I would recommend a solid keyboard to use the internet because there is no way you will be able to use the on screen keyboard and that stupid magic remote without frustration, disappointment, and eventually rage.The stand that comes with it is solid and I am not worried about it falling over. Assembly would be best with 2 people...I did it myself and it was a bit of a pain to lift and place with just me.Pros:Picture qualitybuild qualityPriceDeliveryNot 3DCons:Remote\"smart\" interface - also ties into the remote issueOverall I give this TV 4 stars. For the price, you wont find a better TV. That being said, you should take those savings and invest in a universal remote.Cheers and as always please indicate if this was helpful!", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good \"smart\" HDTV", "Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "RT0G9U16KPN9R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was not only my first HDTV purchase ever, but my first TV purchase, period.  I'd managed to live with hand-me-down and garage-sale TVs up til now, but I decided I wanted something nice for a change. I don't subscribe to cable or satellite television, so I wanted something that had some built-in \"smart\" capabilities. I also wanted something that wasn't going to break the bank. I really dislike 3D content, so I decidedly did NOT want a 3D TV. Finding a nice TV that has smart features and *isn't* 3D is getting harder and harder. For the most part, this TV has fit the bill, and I've been happy with my purchase.I thought about putting together a list of pros and cons, but that didn't really seem to work too well with this particular review, so I've listed some general notes below:-- PICTURE QUALITYIn a word, excellent. Granted, I don't have a whole lot to compare it to, but it's one of the best I've seen. Blacks are good, as are whites. Images are nice and crisp when viewing HD content.-- TURNING OFF TRUMOTIONThe one thing that gave me a real headache with this TV was figuring out how to turn off the TruMotion setting. I know some people are really jazzed about the 120 Hz view and the lack of motion blur, but to me, it made everything look like I was watching a soap opera. (Don't know what I'm talking about? Google \"soap opera effect.\")So I turned it off. That was easy enough: Settings -->' Picture '--> Picture Option '--> TruMotion '--> OFF. There, fixed! Or so I thought. It fixed it for the TV input. But then I started watching something on Netflix (via the app on the TV), and the dreaded soap-opera effect was back!It took me several days of online searching and talking to friends before I figured out that you have to REPEAT THIS process for EVERY SINGLE INPUT. (e.g. Input '--> HDMI 1 -->' Settings '--> Picture '--> Picture Settings '--> TruMotion '--> OFF.) And for the built-in apps, like Netflix, you have to start a video, then go the QMENU -->' Set Video -->' Picture Option '--> TruMotion -->' OFF.Once you've set it for each input and app, though, it does stay defaulted to that. So at least you only have to do it once, not every time you start a new video. I found no online documentation ANYWHERE that specified this, though, so I thought it was definitely worth mentioning in this review. Hopefully it will help someone else.-- SOUND QUALITYNot as great, though not as bad as some flat-panels I've heard. You can turn it up as loud as you want, but after about the half-way point on the volume scale, there's not much difference. It's the same way with my parents' LG HDTV, which is a few years old. I solved this problem by hooking up an external home stereo system (Sony BRAVIA DAV-DZ170 Home Theater System) and bypassing the TV's built-in audio altogether.-- \"SMART\" FEATURESThe \"smart\" features were one of the selling points for me. When it comes down to it, though, I only really use 2 of them - Netflix and Hulu Plus. Some of the reviews (and comments on reviews) suggested that this unit might have an Amazon Instant Video app. It does not. Let me repeat: THIS TV DOES NOT HAVE AN AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO APP. And from what I can tell from various sources online, it never will. No idea why, since there are other LG HDTVs that do. This one just isn't one of them. One user suggested that it just required a firmware update. My firmware is up to date, and there is still no Amazon app. Sorry, people. It just doesn't exist.EDITED 11/25/2013: I updated the firmware recently, and I can confirm that this TV DOES now have an Amazon Instant Video app. Finally!!The \"premium\" apps this TV comes with (or at least, the ones mine came with) are:-- Vudu-- Hulu Plus-- MOG-- AccuWeather.com-- MLB.TV-- Netflix-- CinemaNow-- YouTube-- NHL-- vTuner-- Associated Press-- Facebook-- Picasa-- Google Maps-- Twitter-- Viewster-- Amazon Instant Video (as of Nov 2013)The LG app store is a joke. Forget finding anything you would ever want, much less be willing to pay for, in that store.The online browser is also a joke. If you have to view a website on your TV (e.g. a network television website or Amazon Instant, etc. to view a video), your best bet is to hook up a computer via HDMI. Don't bother trying to do it with the built-in browser. It may work, but it won't work well, and it will be a painful experience. Trust me, I tried.The YouTube app is pretty weak. It works, but it's less user-friendly than even the mobile YouTube website. Good luck finding anything specific.The Netflix and Hulu Plus apps work well enough. They're not as user-friendly to navigate through as their respective websites, but that's to be expected, and I've found that it's easy enough just to queue up things on the computer first, and then play them from the TV apps. That saves you a lot of annoying \"typing\" with the magic remote.I haven't tried any of the others. I see absolutely no reason why I would want to view Google maps, Associated Press content, Twitter or Facebook on my TV. I don't watch sports, so the MLB.TV and NHL apps are of no use to me. I have no idea how well they work. I'm a pretty loyal Pandora user, so I haven't tried MOG. I just plug in my iPhone to my stereo system when I want to listen to music.-- SMART SHAREIt works, but it's not very user-friendly, in my experience. I was able to connect my Win7 laptop to the TV without much difficulty, but it's virtually impossible to search for a particular song or album or artist via the Smart Share interface - browsing seems to be the only option, and that can be a real pain when you have a LOT of music/videos/etc. to scroll through.Streaming music seems to work just fine, but streaming video resulted in a lot of lag, and I've got a great WiFi network set up here. Anything over about 480p just doesn't really stream well on this TV, in my experience.It also seems to lock up the TV frequently, requiring you to turn it off and on again before you can do anything.-- THE \"MAGIC\" REMOTEMany people have complained that this thing is annoying. I don't have a problem with it. It's like a Wii remote: you wave it around, and the cursor on screen follows your movement. There aren't a lot of buttons on it, though - volume up/down, channel up/down, Home (which takes you to the main app/input selection screen), Back (which exits out of the screen you're in), a scroll wheel that serves as channel up/down when you scroll and an \"enter/select\" key when you press it, a Help button, and an Input button.Since I don't have cable TV, I don't have a lot of channels to scroll through when I'm watching actual television, so the lack of a number pad doesn't bother me. But I would find it annoying to have to use a different remote or manage to figure out how to bring up the on-screen number pad if I had hundreds of channels at my disposal and wanted to go to a particular channel instead of just scrolling through them all.The remote sometimes takes a moment to register, too. I've found that you have to wave it around for a second or two before the TV realizes you want to do something and brings up the cursor. I frequently have to recalibrate it, too, by waving it around in a figure-eight motion, to get it to actually recognize my motions.-- SIMPLINKWorks nicely. It was pretty easy to hook up my home theater system so that it turns on and off automatically with the TV.-- THE INPUTSThe inputs all seem fine, and they're plentiful. I don't have that many devices that needed connecting - a DVD player/home theater system and occasionally my laptop (when I want to watch something on Amazon Instant Video or something on another website). It's easy to swap between inputs.-- THE OUTPUTSIt's a little annoying that this TV only supports digital optical audio out, with no other analog options, but I guess it's not really unexpected, given the cost of the system. It hasn't posed a problem for me, but it's something to be aware of if you have an older stereo system that doesn't support that kind of input.-- THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE UNITI was actually pretty impressed with this. I'd heard horror stories about how unstable and top-heavy HDTVs could be. I bought the 42\" and have it mounted on the stand that came with it. It feels pretty sturdy to me. I have cats who seem to think the space between the back of the TV and the wall is the perfect hiding place, and while I definitely do not approve of them being back there (and make them move every time I witness it), they haven't even nudged it.The swivel feature is also useful, since I have it positioned at one angle when I'm watching alone, but want it angled more to the left when there are more people watching, due to the position of my sofa. Swiveling the TV on the stand doesn't feel unstable at all, which I was a little worried about initially.-- PRICEThe price on this unit is excellent. You won't find a lower price anywhere, and if you do - even if it's after you've already made your purchase (as long as it's within 14 days of delivery) - Amazon will honor it, per their \"TV Low Price Guarantee\" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200556860). I purchased this unit at $749, and by the time it shipped, the Amazon price was already $20 lower. They reimbursed me the difference, which was really nice. I see now it's even cheaper. While there are some quirks with the system, this is an unbeatable price for a great TV.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "\"magic remote\" is pretty annoying", "Author": "kuznetsov", "ReviewID": "R2Q2E9AQ1VF0WC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"Magic remote\" is pretty annoying.

The picture is terrific.  It has a large number of input ports and it has a tremendous range of video and audio adjustments.  It more than meets my needs.  The \"Magic Remote\" is another story.  My wife and I hate it.  It is slow and clumsy to use.  It looks cute and sexy, but it does not fit the hand correctly  The buttons you use most are hard to reach.  The thumb wheel you are supposed to push down to execute a menu item does not naturally fall under the thumb, so most the time you accidentally hit the mute button.  The screen pointer pops  up when the Magic Mouse is waved around.  Then you try to align that pointer to the menu item you want, but the pointer usually is not in line with the axis of the remote.  If you have the remote in your hand and you accidentally move it, you will get that obnoxious pointer on your picture.  LG needs to loose that lousy remote.  They let cuteness get in the way of functionality.  That remote is going to hurt their sales.I would not have given the TV 4 stars if there were not a work around to this problem.  I found out from LG that there is an alternative remote from last  year that will work with the TV.  I bought a new AKB72914042 LG remote on eBay for $14.99 + CA sales tax, shipping included.  That remote has a keypad.  It can also be programed to operate your DVD and VHS machines.  There is a  button right on the remote for most of the functions you want to access instead of having to go through a complicated series of on-screen clicks with the Magic Remote.  This remote will access most, but not all the TV control functions.  On the rare occasion when it does not, you can always use the Magic Remote.My bottom line: Buy the TV for the picture, and then buy the alternate remote.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but NO access to Amazon Prime Instant Videos", "Author": "Erik Arneson", "ReviewID": "R2U5V3F8PNAJ9E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The television itself is great, and Netflix works like a charm.

Only con is the buttons should be raised a bit to make them more tactile when operating, especially in the dark. I wish I could sync it to my cable box and \"the Guide\" and use it as a 2nd remote for channel selection.I was initially unable to connect wirelessly to my router, but after disconnecting then reconnecting power to the router it was then reset and able to \"see\" the tv (thanks LG support). Streaming was slow with buffering due to my 3 mbps DSL connection and knew that would be a problem at purchase. I'll be ordering Fios soon. Nice to have a web browser and built-in wifi at this price point. Other mfgs (like Pany) will force you to move up in models (3D) to get it.The firmware installed on my set at purchase didn't include Trumotion options in the settings menu. Trumotion was essentially off with my tv for a month until I got firmware version 03.21.40 via auto update in the middle of a Person of Interest episode. All of a sudden the dreaded \"soap opera effect\" comes alive and Jim Caviezel is auditioning for General Hospital. He'd be bankable in soaps but he's much more compelling at 24 fps; and oh that voice! Solution was simple: go to the Picture Options menu and turn Trumotion off, again. I honestly didn't miss it. I watch a lot of sports and have yet to see any motion issues with Trumotion turned off (it's there if I need it).LG's onboard Picture Wizard II does a nice job with basic calibration. Deep dark blacks, bright whites, vibrant accurate color, and excellent shadow detail. I may recalibrate with Disney's WOW disc but don't feel the need to at this time. Energy saving is turned off. Sound is optimized and pretty good. This set really delivers an astonishing hi def picture. No complaints here. It's so good that any vision acuity problems you may have, however small, become readily apparent with this tv. I need a new prescription!___________________________________________________________________________UPDATE: Software version 04.02.85 arrived on 7/25/12 with long awaited features. The MLB.TV app is now enabled and functional where it wasn't before. The Skype app is new along with keyboard & mouse support. The Magic Remote has become universal and I am now able to sync it to my Time Warner cable box. Only quirk is that once your channel selection is highlighted, a single click will not select it, it takes a double click or two quick presses of the select button (wheel button). Not a con, just a quirk.For people needing the latest Flash update, well, it didn't come with this version. Opening a Flash Player test page site in LG's web browser (Amazon won't allow links to external URLs) revealed it's running version 10.1.105.From LG's website: \"2012 Smart TV Browser Supported Pages - There is not a list of compatible websites accessible by the TV, however, it should be able to display all websites that are not built with Flash 12 or above.\"That said,  LG owes us Flash Player 11 (Flash Player 12 has yet to be released). With the sites I've visited so far Flash hasn't been a problem for me.......yet. At least there's a PC connectivity option. YMMV.

The instructions, via the menus or printed version, are poor for trying to understand all the manual settings, mostly because they use non-standard terms. Their web-chat was equally useless. It took days to slowly refine the picture but it paid off nicely. It's easy to understand why some get the picture right by hiring a specialist or at least buying a DVD setup disk.The audio is plagued, like all the super-thin cabinet form-factor TVs now, simply because there's just no physical room for decent speakers. Noodling around with the sound menu helps a bit, but if you want decent audio, you'll need to feed a real audio system. No surprise.Another small gripe is the HDMI inputs located quite far to the side of an inset on the back. Most HDMI cable aren't very cooperative about bending easily and it's easy to have the cables visible on the left side unless you force them to bend fairly sharply.The build quality was a pleasant surprise.

Some reviews here led me to believe this existed, but in my experience with this TV, that is not an option.This LG 5700 streamed 1/2 of episodes on Hulu (free version) and Daily Show dot com, but then the web browser crashed, or the second half of the show would not load after a commercial.  I talked to customer service, who just told me to buy Hulu Plus and use the app.  The point of me buying a smart TV was to NOT have to pay for extras, but rather use the TV for the same content I was getting free on my laptop.  Can't do this.There were tons of apps, but I have no desire to update my Facebook status on a 42\" screen.  Other useful apps required subscriptions.  Having a Netflix subscription, I was able to test that app, which performed without a hitch.  Quality of the TV was great, except it had that \"soap-opera effect\" typical of 1080p, and I could not adjust the settings to improve it very much.  I enjoyed the \"Magic\" remote, although it sits a little awkwardly in your hand and is a bit slow to type out your online searches.  Setup was EXTREMELY easy - loved that aspect.Right now, I see no advantage to buying a Smart TV when a Roku or AppleTV offer the same paid apps for a lower upfront investment.  I returned this after 1 day, bought a 'dumb' 32\" TV, and will likely invest in a Roku so I can at least access my Netflix subscription on the TV.

I was so nervous about the reviews that I bought a new wireless mouse to connect through a USB before the TV was even delivered. It was a waste of money. I have no problems with the remote. If you have any experience with a Wii remote, you will actually be pleased with how much better the TV remote responds. I can be holding the remote sidewises pointing away from the TV, give it a little shake, and it centers itself on the screen and responds as if I was pointing it directly at the TV. It works from 30 ft away and is very responsive. In fact, given the number of options available with the Smart Apps, I believe a standard remote would be more of a pain to cycle through all the menues using arrows. It's different, but once you get comfortable with it (took me about a day) I actually prefer it.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice tv, bad smart features.", "Author": "shell", "ReviewID": "R2IZ32I3H1DKUI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "TV has a nice picture and the general features are easy to use, but do not expect much from the smart features.

Geraghty \"Resident Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R47ZV0DV4Y5W8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Where to start with this TV. First off, I did a hell of a lot of research up front because our existing TV was an LG and so I was compelled to stay with what I knew. There were other models which were perhaps better reviewed, but 'smart' features were important to me and price was a factor; I'm not the guy that notices the deepest blacks and sharpest contrasts. I was an avid user of the integrated netflix on our 42 inch TV (LG 42LD550) which did work well. In fact, the smart features on this TV seem like an advanced version of what we had on our other TV; which I'm sure is what they are. Essentially, I was looking for a TV with an App center, so I could continue to expand what the TV was capable of even after we purchased it. That's just what I feel we got with the LG 47 LS5700; this is essentially a high end TV with a lower price point because it doesn't have 3D. Apart from that fact it's the same as its 3D counterparts. (IMO)Personally, I don't need 3D features because no one is throwing money at that content wise. It seems more likely that 4K TV's are the next evolution, but I'm not out to dispense my philosophy, just my opinion. Surprisingly enough to me since we bought our last HDTV in January of 2011, the world of HDTVs has gotten even more incredibly thin and light. This whole TV is 49lbs shipped, but lighter than that when you take everything out of the box. One of the other major reasons I picked this TV was when we purchased the 42 incher we had to express ship a 'usb dongle' in order to connect to wifi, whereas this TV is wifi ready; online in two minutes flat. It even has an ethernet port, so I would assume other devices can borrow the connection. (have not tested this)Picture is good, if bright. I'm sure I could fix that with the picture wizard but have not taken the time as of yet. I did have a slight problem connecting and staying connected to wifi when I first turned the TV on, but I think that was a firmware issue. Once I was able to connect and download the update, I haven't had another problem.My only major gripe about the TV is that the 'simplified' remote is kinda like using the Wii-remote, which is fine for gaming, but kinda annoying to have to do all the time. You have a cursor on screen and what is essentially a mouse button to interact with things; this is nice to type stuff on the screen as using number keys is awful (so it is superior in that capacity) but overall I find it cumbersome to interact with the TV in this way. Thankfully, again because our previous TV was an LG, the cable-box remote (which was keyed to the 42) worked seamlessly on the 47 inch. So I find that I use that remote most of the time. Sound isn't bad, but when you narrow the TV border, you decrease the space you have to put in decent speakers. Get yourself a good soundbar if you're an audiophile; then again, YOU probably already have one.Apps I've pulled down so far: browser, facebook, hulu plus, netflix (of course). I'm on the lookout for some music apps, spotify, songza or even pandora, but have not seen them yet. Granted I have not looked extensively.The final thing I will say is that Electronic Express did a bang-up job getting it to me. Granted I live in Cincinnati and they were shipping from Nashville (I could be there in 4 hours by car) but I ordered this on Sunday morning, and I had it by Wed afternoon. Not bad for free shipping.Hit me up if you have further questions, I'll do my best to answer them.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't Control Remote Control", "Author": "Paul J.", "ReviewID": "R11RBND4HZV5HD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I dread using the remote when I need to.

If you have an Android or an iPhone or some kind of tablet (everyone who owns a TV this modern surely has one of these), go to the appropriate app store and download LG Magic.

No more fussing about the Magic Remote. Get the app and you have more control than any traditional remote will give you.This is mainly for people who don't like the Magic Remote. For me personally, I think it's awesome. But I am also very accustomed to using a Wii controller as we have used our Wii for Netflix and Hulu Plus for a long time. The Magic Remote is much smoother than a Wii remote and I think it's very intuitive.The TV is amazing. I was really surprised at how good the sound was for such a slim set.

My son has an XBox 360 hooked up and the video games actually pop. It has 4 HDMI ports and the wireless setup was a piece of cake. I'm a Netflix subscriber and that was also setup in a snap. I have no complaints and the 42\" size fits perfect in the space I have. I think that's what I like most is the size because this is one of the few brands that make a 42\". I was originally looking at the Samsung but they go from 40\" - 47\". You wouldn't believe what a difference that extra two inches make. Plus this TV is very thin.

It takes a little getting used to (technically, it's closer to a computer than a TV) but it's well worth the effort.First, the primary function of a TV, which is the picture display. It is awesome. I can watch TV without glasses.Second, the Smart functions (which is why I bought the TV.) The WiDi connection and the DLNA server interface make connection to your PC and network information fairly easy (WiDi takes a little effort, but LG customer support blames that on the laptop manufacturer.) The Internet is somewhat cumbersome because of the lack of a keyboard, but it will do. If there's a need for a high resolution Internet display for a presentation, etc., it's probably best to do a WiDi connection to your laptop. The mouse wand is a little hard to get used because the pointer arrow is not aligned with the mouse wand, the arrow responds to wand movement, e.g. move the wand to the right and the arrow moves to the right, even if the wand is aligned to the left of the arrow. It's also annoying, because if you bump the wand while watching a movie, etc. the arrow pops up and has to be moved off the screen with the wand.One of the other Reviewers pointed out that a keyboard can be plugged into a USB port, but not a mouse. In order to fully use the Internet, functionality for a bluetooth keyboard and mouse would need to be added.On the negative side, no LG products, including TVs, DVD players, etc. have Amazon Prime and it definitely does not work through the Internet. Also, LG products are saddled with overseas technical support, where you can barely understand the Rep.'s accent, even if you can find someone who is competent technically. My technical support Rep. told me that my TV didn't have WiDi and that I had to buy an external PushTo box. When I spoke to his Supervisor, he told me that the TV did have WiDi so the problem had to be with the laptop. Eventually, I was able to get the right combination of settings, but it typically takes a dozen or so attempts to make a connection. Once the connection is made though, it's solid.This is actually the second LG Smart TV that I bought this year. I liked this one so much, I bought another one.In conclusion, the LG Smart TVs are a new generation, and there are growing pains, just as there has been with the entire technology industry, but I definitely recommend buying one.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lousey service", "Author": "Jon Malte \"J M\"", "ReviewID": "R2WK6U5XD2T2BP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought LG 60\" TV three weeks later lost picture.

This was a must for us as our living room has large windowsand a bright background.  We rejected a Sony TV because excessive glare and backgroundreflections made it annoying and unwatchable.The TV had the features we wanted, plenty of HDMI & USB inputs, Ethernet, and ATSC tuner.Everything prety much worked well, setup was easy, the sound, images and colors were good.We were initially pleased with the TV except for the Magic Wand remote controller.They should offer an option for a traditional remote.The user interface for the magic system is set up to resemble a computer windowsoperation, with the cursor used as a pointer to select the various options.  Thisinterface needs more work as it takes several 'clicks' and points to accomplishsimple tasks like INPUT Selection, ZOOM options, etc.  Even channel tuning requireda 'pop up' screen and point & click operations.After the novelty of the point & click wears off I see this controller system becominga major drag.  To make matters worse, my wife and parents were not able operate it.The major dissappointment was RELIABILITY.  The TV went dead after only 22 days.In the middle of watching the Olympics the screen gradually went dark, a brightyellow line appeared and then faded.  Finally the screen was entirely dark.

They recommended secheduling aservice call.The next morning sanity returned, we cancelled the service call, and took the TVback to Costco.  They gave us another one ( new, unopened box ).This TV only took 5 minutes after the setup was complete to fail.  To be fair, theATSC tuned programming had no failures, but most of our input is from a set top boxvia an HDMI input.  At random times ( usually 2 to 10 minutes ) the screen would goblack for about 1 to 3 seconds.  Then the picture would return to normal.

The interface is quite different from most other TVs and the pointer \"magic\" remote is definitely an adjustment. There aren't any numbers on the remote... That said, after a few days of use, it's becoming more natural and I'm starting to actually enjoy some of the benefits of LG's interface. While it may not be terribly intuitive (especially at first), it can be utilized to efficiently access apps and to change audio/video inputs pretty quickly.Picture quality is quite good. Price was right and slightly less glare/gloss compared to Samsung's similar 55in model.I will say that I prefer the set top box remote (Comcast) to browse through the guide, DVR, and On Demand. On screen keyboard can be a pain but coming from a Samsung Smart TV, the keyboard input on that device wasn't much better.One pleasant surprise is that this tv supports the Pandora app. After purchase, I came across a few people mentioning that it did not. I'm not sure if there was an update released or what, but Pandora is downloadable and works. Slight preference for the Samsung smart TV Pandora app as I like that interface a bit more but the LG app gets the job done. MLB.TV works well as does Netflix. Connecting to the wireless network wasn't difficult.I have used the Android app to control the TV a bit. It's a little gimmicky but decently convenient.

Sound quality is decent but I'd suggest getting a sound bar or hook it up to a home theater as I have. Also its easy connects to your home media server using Plex that is if you have one. Plus its fairly cheap right now considering how much other TV's this size (55\") cost and nearly half what it was a little over a year ago.Then we get to the dark side of this particular TV. The remote...how do I put this...is terrible. Does it work? Yes, it does. Do I despise it? Yes, yes I do. Its a pointer style remote ala Wii style (but worse) where you point it at the TV to control a mouse pointer like arrow to select things. Basic functions are still buttons on it like volume, power, and channel but nearly everything else makes you point at a screen with the remote. This gets tiring fast, and every time you move or bump it the arrow reappears mid screen unless you place it on a table where the remote will be undisturbed.

I couldn't even figure out how to change inputs on the TV.  Turns out it is on the application menu - one must accept a disclaimer about the applications before he can even change inputs. It is only possible to switch inputs with a DirecTV remote on the TV setting.  On the DTV setting, the input button doesn't get you all the way there.2) The sound on this TV is awful.  I think that the max is 100.  7 is quiet.  Going from 15 to 40 makes almost no difference and it never gets very loud.  I can't imagine why people want to sacrifice so much on sound quality just to make these things thinner.  Even so, why not add a few inches at the bottom for speakers.  Or make an inexpensive sound bar (screw the subwoofer and HDMI connections - just two medium sized speakers and a little amp - with analog connections).Other notes:The picture is OK - pretty standard with flash-lighting all around on blank/black screens.The TV won't connect to my older linksys wireless router but wired networking seems to work pretty well.  I don't use the applications much.I had to update the firmware before I could adjust Tru-motion.The brightness sensor is not very useful - TV is often too dim or too bright.The HDMI connections are on the left side (as viewed from the front) and point sideways.

The TV setup very easily, 1080p content is excellent and sound quality is good.  The voice clarity mode works well and lets you hear the dialog without having to turn up the volume. While some have described the Magic Remote as somewhat odd, she found it fairly simple to use.  Once connected to the internet, viewing Netflix content was easy and navigating the screens was not difficult.  You do have to get used to the idea of moving the remote to move the cursor on the screen, but that didn't take long.  Typing uses the virtual on-screen keyboard but it's certainly usable.  Compared to my older LG TV which doesn't have a magic remote, this is definitely easier since you just move the cursor and click.  I've ordered a wireless keyboard with a built-in trackball to make typing easier. Setting up the internet connection was a breeze it detected the network SSID and accepted the WPA passphrase with no problem.The TV is amazingly thin and looks beautiful. While we set it up using the stand, I can see this blending into the wall with a slim mount.  Overall, this was an excellent value @$649 with free shipping and there are many features that are yet to e explored.Update 1/28/13: The wireless keyboard/touchpad connected easily via Bluetooth, and worked.

FYI this model i'm reviewing is the non 3D model.its a slim LED tv that was very simple to set up. once you've hooked up all your cables, it'll start setup once you put the batteries in the magic remote and power on the tv. oh and the buttons on the tv are touch sensitive!once the tv is on it'll ask for input via the remote controller thats packaged with it. you just follow the setup all the way to the end and boom all done!this model tv has wifi ready, so once your done with the initial setup and you've entered your wifi info, do a system update wirelessly, just hit the  \"my apps\" button on the remote and go to settings and go to i believe the last icon on the bottom of the list, and it should say software update or something along those lines, but its simple to find. the update itself took about 5 - 8 minutes i believe? dont quote me on that, but at minimum 5min, well for me at least. after you've updated, you can now use any apps that were preinstalled onto the tv. i tested Facebook on this, and its very barebones. after you've activated your Facebook via a computer and added the activation code, your able to post comments, like posts, watch user videos, and see your newsfeed. it's pretty much all there if say you can't be on the computer at the moment, but it in no way is a replacement of your computer or smartphone app of facebook. they also have netflix, and skype if you bought an lg webcam to be attached to your tv. it also comes with cinema now. all these apps are pretty simple to activate.i personally dont see myself really using the apps all that much, but its nice that they are there. now i'm still learning how to use this new set, i've went into picture wizard 2, where i choose how the picture will look like, for example, having the picture experience be a warmer tone or a cooler tone, it helps you adjust brightness, contrast, sharpness etc, than allows you to save the settings you just created to just one input or several inputs that you can check off or not. i thought that was a pretty cool feature.i'm not a fan of 120hz tv's, and this is one of those tv's. for me its like watching someone on tv as if i'm watching it live, you know? so far i haven't found the setting to shut off 120hz and put it to 60hz, i gotta tinker with it some more.the remote control is kind of iffy for me. i mean it works. its kind of like the nintendo wii's remote only your constantly adjusting this magic remote. i do like that you give it a good shake towards the tv and it auto adjusts to the center of the screen. but once you move out of the ranger of the tv you have to readjust it again. BUT there is an LG app for smartphones where you download it to ur phone and than you can actually use your smartphones touch screen to move the magic remotes cursor, i thought that was an ingenius idea, and i kind of like that a lil more than using the remote, it even gives you volume and channel controls on ur smart phone!another lil feature is that you can easily program the magic remote to work with your cable box. i have time warner, so after choosing the model of the cable box and the company (time warner) i'm able to use the magic mouse when watching cable tv. the guide/menu buttons that are on ur cable remote pop up on screen on the tv, so if you have a dvr you dont need your cable remote after doing the setup, all the buttons are on the top or bottom of the screen! that was pretty cool.all in all, i'm very happy with this new tv. its slim, sleek, great power saving options(its energy star certified) and for what i paid (699.99) i get a lot for my dollar.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV but missing Skype", "Author": "Frankthetank242", "ReviewID": "R2Q2KZNBR0U5W0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the 47\" model about a month ago and set up was pretty easy after messing with the settings I got the picture to where i wanted it to be at. The smart TV interface is nice but sometimes its a bit glitchy and freezes not to often though but turning it on and off brings it back to normal also a big factor in buying the tv for me was that it was advertised as having skype included in the premium content i recently moved to another state and i use skype a lot to keep in touch with family so I thought it would be nice if i could use it on the tv but its not anywhere in the apps to be found other than that its a great tv just kind of sucks that they would advertise it as being skype ready when its not even installed or available for download.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG 55LS5700 55-Inch TV", "Author": "Charles Goeking", "ReviewID": "R1VMEL5KW0JQR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Super TV.

I contacted LG to report the problem and inquired about getting it either repaired or replaced per their warranty. I was informed that it would be at least 10 days before the repairman could attempt a repair (once he had the parts) and, if he was unable to make the repair, it would be another 10-14 days before it would be replaced.This is the second TV I purchased from LG. The first one also broke (13 months after I purchased it). In that case, the internal components overheated and burned. The repairman was amazed it didn't actually catch fire (and thus potentially catch my house on fire).Do not buy an LG television.

BUT BEWARE SMART TV: After buying a new router and extender to make sure the tv had adequate signal I was unable to get the tv to accept my network password. Finally I called LG and they said that because my password had a space the tv wouldn't accept it. Everything else we own--computers, phones, Rokus, Samsung Smart DVD, etc.--has no problem with our password configuration; but not LG. So, apparently I have to change everything to accommodate the tv. My new network has a guest channel, but that won't work either since the tv has no way for you to enter a password on the guest network access page. I tried to download the LG smart-phone controllers but those only work with certain models (NOT THIS ONE); too bad because it would've been an easy solution since you have keyboard access on those. In sum, I'm very disappointed with this product; I feel like I spent extra money to get something that doesn't work as advertised. I'm now debating whether it's worth my while to send the tv back to Amazon.Follow Up: Since I did get such a good price on the tv from Amazon, it appears that the most cost effective solution is to just buy another Roku. Still, I'm annoyed with LG's strange firmware eccentricities and the fact that I have to buy yet another Roku to compensate for a failed smart tv (I had similar connectivity problems with a Sony I bought a few years ago). Well, at least Roku makes a good, reasonably-priced product.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stay away from LG", "Author": "Verne Severson", "ReviewID": "R78X24D9GNUMD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After our experience with LG I would suggest staying away from this manufacturer.  We bought the LG 42LV5500 flat panel TV from Amazon.  After using it for ten months it stopped working.  It is still covered by the manufacturer's one year warranty.  We called that evening and they said they would send someone out to repair it.  After a delay of about a week they told us that the repair parts are back ordered another two to three weeks.  We asked for our money back or a replacement TV.  Their customer service says it will take three to four weeks to evaluate our request.
