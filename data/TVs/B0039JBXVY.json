{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Picture Quality Stood Out vs All the Others", "Author": "Chris H.", "ReviewID": "RAGDNPW0EBIWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for just over 24 hours and so far I'm pleased.  I chose the LG 5400 after visiting the local blue and yellow store as they were changing over their 2009 models to the 2010s. I was initially impressed by the Samsung LED LCDs and was getting close to buying the Samsung 7100 (7000 everywhere else with a red ToC vs. Grey at this store) when on my third trip to the store, they had just put the LG up on the wall.  The picture stood out right away from the Samsungs and the Panasonic Plasma above it.  The other decidng factor over the Samsung was the matte screen on the LG.  The Samsungs have a high gloss screen just like a Plasma which is a problem for the room that I planned to put the TV in.  It has multiple windows and lots of light so a high gloss screen would reflect way too much.  As for the Pro's and Cons, here's what I have noticed so far:Pro's: Picture quality with deep blacks and sharp contrast, picture adjustment wizard and ability to tweak it to the Nth degree including judder, sleek case appearance, internet widgets (haven't played with these too much yet so they might just be toys to brag about but, not too useful), Solid buildCons: missing some features that others in the price range have like local dimming LEDs, PIP/POP, room light sensing, and a universal remote, 120hz instead of 240hz (not that I've noticed a problem yet).Lastly, a note about mounting this TV on a wall; all of the permanent hook-ups are on the back surface (i.e not recessed into the case) so if you plan to use a low profile mount, you'll need right angle adapters for everything (HDMI, Component Video, VGA, etc).  You'll need at least 1.75\" of clearance from the back of the TV to the wall to get all your connections made.  You'll also need to use a recessed outlet.  I ended up scrapping the low profile mount and using a tilting mount that gave me 2.5\" of clearance.  Made life alot easier at the sacrifice of some sleekness on the wall.  This shouldn't have been a big surprise given how thin the TV is but, I made the mistake.  Oh well.  After I've lived with this TV for a while longer I'll post an update but, so far so good.UPDATE 1-11-11:I've had this TV for about 10 months now and I'm still very pleased with it.  I should note that I made a mistake in my original review under CONS wich was that this TV does NOT have room light sensing to dim the backlight.  To the contrary, this TV DOES HAVE ROOM LIGHT SENSING.  My mistake which I didn't notice until recently.  There are only two observations that I can add since my original review and later comments: 1. One of the infrequent software updates seemed to have erased my custom picture and sound settings. 2. Occasionally the room light sensor gets tripped up in a dark room and ramps up the brightness then back to normal.  The first observation was more of an annoyance and had only happened with one update.  The second observation may be due to a software update or possibly something on my component stand below the TV throwing it off.  I really don't know yet what causes this to happen but, it is infrequent and did not start to happen until several months after purchasing the TV.  Otherwise, I'm still very happy with it and expect it to last a long time.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "J. Davis \"Renst\"", "ReviewID": "R260O0KBB8TCZ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is written from the perspective of a first-timer in the world of HD and large screens. I held off until I was satisfied with the picture quality, thickness, and price of LCDs. After more than a year of research online and in person, LG won out over all others, for the above reasons and the matte screen. Our TV faces a wall of windows.We had a tough time deciding on a 47\" or 55\". Our viewing distance is only 10', and we didn't want to overwhelm the room with an obnoxiously sized TV. In my exhaustive research on TV viewing distance, several points kept repeating, namely that 1) few people regret getting a TV that is too large, but many regret getting a TV that is too small; and 2) if a TV seems too large at first, it will rapidly become \"just right\". Ours didn't seem too large at first, and I'm VERY glad we didn't get anything smaller, and we could even go a bit larger for HD material and more of an immersive feel. The only possible problem as I see it is there is more work involved in watching movies on a larger screen - your eyes have to move more. This is especially obvious when a scene cuts back and forth between two people talking, with one of them on one side of the screen, the other on the opposite side. It's something to get used to.Non-HD material: as expected, it doesn't look as good as it did on a CRT TV. With some material, such as cartoons, it's not just a TV size/resolution issue - there are compression artifacts everywhere that look awful up close. This is a function of the digital source, though, not the TV. The TV just makes it more obvious. Regular DVDs look better once you adjust the picture - the \"Standard\" setting is vivid but unrealistic.HD material looks spectacular. I thought Avatar would look great, but it's better than I hoped it would be. HD picture quality is a no-brainer with the LGs and you can see them in person compared to other sets at any time, so I won't go into more detail than that. The matte screen diffuses light and it's perfect for the room.Now for the dreaded audio sync issue. The TV I received does have it, badly with the blu-ray player, very slightly with HD cable (you can't tell unless you really look for it, and some channels are worse than others). There seems to be a lot of misinformation about this, and people everywhere are returning TVs and blu-ray players, getting technicians to come out and update their firmware and even replacing the mainboard in the TV, none of which seems to help.Here's the scoop - it's a problem with the TV, not the blu-ray player, at least in the case of this TV. Apparently the HDMI input circuitry slows down the audio, causing it to fall behind the video. This has been a problem with several manufacturers' LCD TVs for years, including some from Samsung. There is no fix available from LG for this, and I don't think there will be until enough reviews complain about it. There are a few solutions, however:1) Use component video cables for blu-ray instead of HDMI, which was my permanent solution.2) I was able to eliminate the problem with HDMI/regular DVDs by setting the DVD player's output to 24hz (cinema) instead of 60hz. There's no flickering or loss of picture quality that I can detect. This trick didn't work with blu-ray DVDs, so I went with the component cables instead.3) Use an A/V receiver that has a delay feature, and route your HDMI through that. I don't have one, so I don't have any more information on this.I'm giving it 4 stars for the outstanding HD picture quality, low price, and the thin matte screen. If it wasn't for the audio sync problem, it would very easily be 5, but I can't reward LG for something that has been an issue with their sets for so many years.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality, acceptable sound, good features", "Author": "Sathya Srinivasan", "ReviewID": "R7DXC08QGWHQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought the TV a few weeks back from Amazon and have been impressed with the quality so far. I did reasonable research before buying this TV to replace an old 27\" TV that I had for almost 11 years and wanted something that had good features.I compared the LG with Samsung 6500 series TV at a local store and did not notice any significant difference between the two. Compared to a bunch of TVs next to this one, the brightness seemed a bit high (relatively less dark), but nothing concerning.I ordered the TV through Amazon for a decent price and the service was good (Ceva). They delivered to the second floor but I had to setup the TV myself (no installation and check-up like a full-fledged white-glove service). It was not difficult but needs 2 people at least.The picture quality is sharp and clear and the sports action (football) was quite good. The audio lacks punch, as can be expected from a 10w speaker. However, I wish they included better speakers by default. Also had to purchase a wi-fi adapter separately. Again, would've been nice if it were included with the system (hence 1 star less). That said, it is no different from its competitors.The biggest reason I went for the LG compared to Samsung was the price (around $500 less for the same features) and the matte finish. The matte finish makes a huge difference if you are going to keep the TV in a well-lit room. In the store, I could see all the lights in the back reflected off the Samsung, while it was hardly noticeable in the LG. Same at home with large windows.So far, I have not noticed any weird issues as mentioned in the other posts. The picture quality is good and the brightness, contrast, and colors are more than adequate for an average TV user.If you are in the market for a 55\" TV and if you have a bright room, this is definitely worth a consideration.Pros:- Excellent picture quality- Standard set of Internet applications (Netflix, Picasa, YouTube, Vudu)- Reasonable number of options to tweak- Matte finish is great for a brightly lit room with large windows- DLNA support works flawlessly to stream music from computer to the TV (haven't tried video yet)- Input and Output ports are sufficient for most scenarios- Very thin (around 1\")- Aesthetically pleasingCons:- Speaker quality is average. A home theater system is strongly recommended for better quality- Remote control is average. It's clunky to type using the remote- Internet Widgets are slow, but functional. Not too many widgets. Removing widgets is not intuitive.- Additional wi-fi adapter required for wireless Internet connectivity.

The LG 55LE5400 provides all the features I wanted for viewing TV, internet or other media I have available. That is a plus. Most important, it the very thin profile that I wanted for wall mounting.  The picture is sharp and bright when viewing HD sources, however other than HD sources look a bit fuzzy.  That's disappointing but expected.  High motion scenes in sports action, are blurred. The TV has 120Hz refresh rate which is suppose to help this situation.  This blurring takes some getting used to and becomes less anoying over time.  Otherwise I'm satisfied with the picture except for a quality issue that has yet to be fixed.  The set has had a problem with the backlighting from day one.  The lower right fourth of the screen is noticably darker than the rest of the viewing area.  LG was responsive and sent a technician to the house to look at it.  He said at least one of the LED backlights is not working (this is new right out of the box) and ordered a new screen since the backlights are an integral part of the screen.  I'm still waiting for the new screen.  If it takes much longer to fix this issue my opinion of LG and this set will change drastically.", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV, excellent price!", "Author": "Pyroboy", "ReviewID": "R24XEFOVAYMN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent way too much time looking for a TV, and was pretty sure that I did not want a plasma since I play a lot of video games and don't like the potential for burn-in and I think LCD and LED TV's are brighter and better for video games.  So I decided that I was getting an LCD or LED and have been looking at this one, and a few others, for almost a year.  I have a 40\" Sony 720p that I was replacing, but I didn't want to spend upwards of $1500 more just for 3D.  I have a 4 year old daughter and I don't have time to sit and watch lots of movies, so 3D isn't a big priority to me or us.  I was looking at Best Buy for the most part since I have a Best Buy Credit Card and planned on getting 18-36 months of free financing, but this TV went down in price and I finally pulled the trigger.  I have never bought anything of this size from Amazon and was nervous about not buying from a local dealer and the delivery from thousands of miles away.  But it (finally!!!) came and I couldn't be happier.The picture is AWESOME and the sound is great actually, sure it's not a surround system, but for anyone that downgrades the sound quality when compared to a surround system is just comparing apples to bananas.  The sound is great, the touch sensors on the front right are just COOL!  The basic menu items like power, volume, channel, etc are all hidden on the front of the panel but are touch sensitive areas that light up when the TV is on (the power one lights up if you want it to when it is off) really are a cool touch.  Sure I won't used them a lot, but they are a really high-end feature on an affordable TV.I have it mounted above our fireplace in the basement and it was easy to mount, shockingly thin, and it looks great on the wall.  The shipping was longer then I thought, they quoted me August 26th, when I bought it on the 18th, but I didn't get it until the 31st, but all in all for free shipping I porbably can't complain too much.  That was then only thing Amazon disappointed me on, but if you are considering buying a TV from Amazon, trust me don't hesitate any longer, I was a huge skeptic, and now am a very satisfied customer!  Overall I got a GREAT TV for an amazing price, and saved the sales tax and a lot of $ over Best Buy, but all in all I couldn't be happier.This TV is mainly going to be used for high-def sports broadcasts and video games.  I play XBOX 360 and PS3 at night when my wife and daughter are asleep, and I LOVE IT!!  I watched a Blu-ray after I bought it on my PS3 and couldn't believe how amazing it looks!Overall this is the best TV I have ever owned.  I have no regrets about buying from amazon and got this TV for about $400-$500 cheaper than Best Buy.(I paid $1488 for mine on amazon in late August, with no sales tax, and free shipping.  I did buy the 4 year warranty to be safe, but got an amazing deal!)Pros:  Everything...picture, sound, design, value, ease of use, features, and most of all the PRICE!Cons:  Maybe just the shipping time.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "An amazing TV for the price", "Author": "pbug56 \"Photobug\"", "ReviewID": "RI7H4IHI316TT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've just acquired the 55LE5400 as a service contract replacement for a rear projection CRT 50\" set.  I was trying to get the best 55\" set I could for a certain price level (around $2k) and after going through what was available this one jumped out.  That, and good reviews on the web for it, even though the CNET review was kind of down on it.This is an LED edge lit set, so as CNET points out, it will not be as effective at controlling brightness of certain scenes as one with a full back panel of LEDs.  Sure, a year from now that will likely be common at this price level, but not yet.The set was a bit of a pain to put on its stand (took 3 people), but once done it was very easy to hook up and get going.  The MENU is a bit strange but is easily learned.  It does not seem to allow for manual channel labelling, and input labelling is limited.  Like most sets today, it does not have S Video (still useful if one has an S VHS deck or a Laser Disc player (not all LDs have DVD replacements still), and the only audio outputs are headphone (which cuts off the speakers) and Toslink.  We have someone in the house at times with poor hearing, and we want to hookup a set of analog headphones so that person can set the volume to what he needs while others watch and listen via the TV speakers.  To do this I'll need to spend about $130 to get a Gefen Dolby input digital to analog converter; it would have been nice to have a simple analog audio output that was independent of the speakers (without turning the speakers off); this is also a common problem with today's TVs.The remote is a bit annoying; it is easy to hit the picture button (changing video attributes) when one wants to change inputs.  One then has to go in via the menu to fix the error.  Other then that it's easy to handle, and the codes for it were easily found for the TIVO remote by using the appropriate TIVO menu setup item.Once I finished the basic setup and ran through the picture wizard, I looked at a number of programs; directly through the QAM tuner, via a TIVO Premiere XL, a Toshiba HD player with HD DVDs, and a Sony Blu Ray player with BD discs.  I realized something right away; that what I was looking at seemed amazingly real in a way I've never before experienced on TV.  My 16 year old daughter complains that on crime shows the blood and gore is now to scary to watch!I've heard complaints about the audio; I've not heard any problems so far on my set.  One cute thing; it seems there is a way to turn off video while leaving the audio active, thus cutting power usage to under 40 watts, presumably while one takes a nap.  Even with video on the rated power use is under 200 watts; this is an Energy Star set.  It probably uses a quasrter or less of the power needed by the TV it replaced.  The TV has timers to turn it on and off as well as a sleep timer; this is a nice combo.The set is amazingly thin.  Its screen is reasonably glare resistant; we can see glare in our room with many windows and lights, but it is normally hardly noticable.If one can afford 3D and / or full LED back lighting, great.  If not, and one wants a 55\" set, this appears to be an excellent choice.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "only 2 weeks old and not working!", "Author": "lola's mom", "ReviewID": "R2C88D47QBBXBN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I reviewed several different HD TV's for several weeks. I needed one which had a Matte finish as my living room is Very Bright and I did not want alot of glare. So I choose LG. I also got a free Blu-ray player with this model. I did not buy from Amazon but from a store in my area. I did not want to risk my inexperience. It was delivered and set up. First, I was dissapointed in the lack of paper manual. I like a to have a paper manual and this one is on a CD not even a DVD. So I had to view the manual from a different room. Of course, I could print out the 144 pages.. Next I find the remote a tad awkward. The Input for changing from Sat/cable to DVD and Blu-ray is at top of remote while the enter button is down towards the end. When Input is pressed, you have to be quite quick to slide down entire length of remote to press enter or else the screen reverts to current picture. Kind of annoying. But the BIG ISSUE is last night while watching a show, the screen split on half (not picture in picture). On 1 side was the clear picture but the other side turned into this thermal-imaging looking view of the picture. Not pixelating- never seen anything like that. I thought it was the satellite but trouble-shot with Sat staff-nope.. Called LG and the guy was dumbfoundered and told me he'd never heard of that issue and I better call for service. OH GREAT!!!

The \"lip sync\" issue is my ONLY reason for not wanting to give a full 5 star's without any hesitation. This product gives me everything and more that I desire. I do wish that the PIP (picure-in-picture) was rescued in our products offered once again. That is a feature that I really do miss (not featured from most any manufacturer).The audio problem (lip sync) did seem to improve after I bought and attached the wireless dongle. It found and ran the LG updates automatically. I love the use of the Netflix, Yahoo, YouTube, and Picasa widgets. I use all that are available to me (except Vudu) and I look forward to the many other(s) that I hopefully will see soon. The thin & lightweight feature as well as the many other options of this product are just incredible. I love the \"Aspect Feature\" & \"Picture Mode\" that this set has. The remote is smartly arranged and well thought out. The screen is bright and amazingly clean and sharp to the eye at most any angle that you could/would attempt to place it in.

The first thing readers should be aware of are the negatives, if none of them bother you, then I'd go right ahead and buy this.Three Big Negatives using Headphone Jack1) Headphone jack volume controlled by TV volume.This annoys me because as soon as you unplug the headphones, the sound comes on.  If you were listening to something loud, or just at night and trying to be very quiet, you'll get a loud awakening.  What would be better would be constantly outputting a signal w/gain to the headphone jack, that could then be controlled by the volume control on my cordless headphones (all cordless headphones and lots of corded headphones have volume control)2) Headphone jack shuts volume off when headphone plugged inThis really annoys me.  My TV is over the fireplace mantle, and using the headphones is a chore because you can't keep them plugged in, else you don't get any sound from the TV speakers.3) Headphone jack shuts optical output down as wellThis could have been a fix to #2, but when the headphone is plugged in, you lose optical audio output.  So if you have a nice A/V Receiver handling all the audio and plug in your headphones, you lose sound.Now I know some of you will just say - don't use the LG headphone jack.  Use the one on your nice A/V receiver. This would work for my cable and blu-Ray which are plugged directly into the A/V Receiver, but unfortunately Netflix and other LG apps built into this TV and that won't work.Other negatives:4) Black Level.  While the picture is gorgeous, black level is not.  It is a very dark gray.5) Rear Facing Inputs.  I mounted this initially using a Chief Super Slim mount.  Because the rear ports are facing the rear and not up or down, even with 90 degree cable adapters, the cables wouldn't fit (I got this within .25\" from the wall).  I actually had to get a different mount which now isn't so sexy and close to the wall.POSITIVES:1) Price - sub $1,500 for a Netflix ready TV that is 55\" and LED backlit.2) Netflix works like a charm.3) Picture - beautiful on everything but Star Wars, the Dark Knight, Star Trek and other dark TV shows/movies.  LOST looks amazing!4) Remote - I usually hate remotes that come with TV's, but this one is nicely laid out and was easy to use before I programmed my learning universal remote with the codes.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG 55 inch HD TV", "Author": "Terry Oberer", "ReviewID": "R248QJJ23IJMY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very easy for a non-techno old man to set up and enjoy immediately.

This TV can be found for around 1.5 grands and thus makes a good value. Its performance is quite satisfactory. It is extremely thin and thus will look amazing mounted on a wall. Speakers for such thin profile TV are sufficient - you should enable the virtual surround from the menu to add more \"presence\" to otherwise tinny default sound but adding separate sound system will take care of it. The edge-lit mechanism does show un-even lighting when the screen is totally dark but once a picture is displayed, there is no hint of it and the picture looks so amazing that it really is a non-issue for real-world. The default STANDARD picture setting is good for most programming but if you are watching a movie in a almost dark room with lights off, change it to CINEMA setting and it will look better. I watched new Battlestar Galactica on Blu-ray via PS3 on it and the Cinema setting even removed the grain that was intentionally left on the video - frankly, i liked the cleaned up image a lot better. I don't care about the NetApps as i have connected it to a PS3 but the WiFi adapter is normally available for under 50 bucks so that's also reasonable.The TV does have most of its inputs at the rear so that won't work well with wall mounting BUT it does have one set of Component (with adapter cables provided) and one HDMI on the side that should take care of it. Another excellent feature is ability to disable all external lights (even power and LG logo) so that when watching a movie in a dark room, the screen/picture is all that one sees.

I purchased this prior to thanksgiving and it was delivered on the 30th and this is where the issues began. Firstly the delivery man showed up late (annoying but not too bad - he showed up outside of the agreed window). Even though I was upset, I was heartened by the prospect of getting my new TV. Well when it arrived, so did the issues - I want to clearly warn any buyers to stay away from the vendor Warehouse Deals - fulfilled by Amazon because they frankly do not sell quality products. They have done a huge disservice to this TV because I am now absolutely never going to deal with them ever again. The TV showed up bent - yes I meant to say bent. How, you ask. Well, the top frame of the unit was bowed outwards - this was clearly visible and when the unit is turned on, you can see the displacement of light around the damage. I called Amazon the following day to return the unit and I was assured that I would be contacted in the next 24 hours by the carriers to pick it up. Well after 24 hours, and no contact I became concerned and reached out to the carrier - they had no idea what I was talking about. I called Amazon back and I was told that they were sorry, somehow the notification to the carrier did not get through and they would schedule it again (huh???). On top of that, I would not be sent a replacement unit, I had to wait for the refund to be processed to purchase another one; and to top it all off - the refund could not be issued until the carrier picks it up and even after that, it would take another 'few business days to clear'. So I am stuck with a defective TV, no refund to purchase another one and hoping that the carrier contacts me to pick it up. If I am lucky, this might resolve itself in about a week or so; I am however sorry I did not listen when my wife advised me to go to best buy/Wal-Mart/brandsmart etc.I thought that purchasing a big ticket item like this from Amazon ensured that some diligence would be expected around quality and I am sorely disappointedDecember 15 2010 updateMy replacement TV finally arrived yesterday and I mounted it on the wall and was immediately struck by how clear the picture is. I agree with the reviewer who said that these images are so clear on some channels, you sometimes wonder if it is too clear (watching cars on it was a treat - my 7 year old was shocked at how clear it was). Understand that she had watched the same movie on my 55\" Sony DLP and was not that impressed.So let's dispense with the formalities.Picture; 4/5From a picture point of view I rate this TV a 4; the reason it does not get a 5 is that I have it wall mounted and the glare from the light fixture in the room is very noticeable in dark scenes. My solution is to turn of the overhead lights and only use the table lamp while watching the TV at night. The wireless dongle works - Period! I stuck it in, worked through the menu, it immediately recognized my Belkin Wireless N router, prompted me for the security code and I was on my way to 1080P Vudu bliss.Audio: 5/5Hey folks, it's a 1.2 inch TV, if you realistically want to compare it to a surround sound system or the older model table top HDTVs, recall that those other TVs had the real estate to install speakers - this one does not. You give up a bit in sound quality to get the vaunted size and thinness of LEDs. I could not in good faith penalize this TV for that.Ergonomics: 3/5It is simply impossible to access some of the inputs from behind the TV if is it mounted on the wall - LG should have considered utilizing more side inputs over the traditional back placement. This made for a very uncomfortable setup experience since I connected the RGB for my nettop, two HDMI (blu ray, dvr) my wireless portable usb storage drive and my surround sound system. I drilled a hole at the back of the TV to run the wires down to the components out of sight and due to the placement it was impossible to hang the TV flush on the wall with the wires connected. My solution was to hang it on the top part of my cheetah wall mount. I am truly considering purchasing the LG Media kit in lieu of this. I am scoring this TV lover due to this.Remote: 3/5This has been covered already. The remote is adequate - a bit unintuitive when it comes to the data entry required for things like yahoo widgets, wireless router pass key entry etc. It grows on you but I suspect that I may have to look for an aftermarket alternative universal remote but I am worried about losing some of the cool functionalities the OEM came with. Basically, I am ambivalent about the remote.Extras: 4.5/5This TV is chuck-full of surprises and cool stuff. Here are some snippets of each feature's characteristicsVudu:  Easy setup, once you activate it, Vudu gives you a credit of 5.99 which is enough to purchase one of their HD movies. Recommendation; if you want to stream movies - you really need to consider the highest end DSL or cable broadband. The Vudu library is glorious in its 1080p format.Netflix: Equally easy activation, it allows you to establish your preferences etc and the setup is a breeze, the TV basically generates a code that you enter into your online Netflix account via your PC and voila, like magic, you are good to stream at your heart's contentDivX USB player: Hands down my very favorite feature (OMG!). This player is seamless, I still have not stumped it with any video format I have tried to play - seriously. My movie catalog of over 200 is quickly assembled in an easy to view menu and get this; the remote control has buttons that allow you to pause, speed up, stop, play etc , etc. the movie. This is by far my favorite feature on this TV.Nero Home Media Center: (very Improtant) To fully enjoy this TV, you must install this (installation CD comes with TV0. I have a portable harddrive (1TB) hooked up to my desktop PC which is networked to my laptop (I use the laptop to surf and download content to the hard drive wirelessly). With Nero installed and acting as a media server (all media content stored in the external hard drive), the TV quickly recognized the drive and voila! I can stream all me music, movies stored there - Over the holidays I was in heaven with access to downloaded content, netflix, vudu all from my TV.Aesthetics: 5/5This TV really looks good - I have it mounted in my study/man-cave and it sits about 4 feet off the floor (from the base) and really looks distinctive with understated smooth lines and black casing. The LG logo is  lit with a bright white light but I understand that it can be set to be turned off during operations.Overall - this is a great product and I want to rescind the comments I made earlier because it was based on a defective product and this review is based on reviewing/viewing an actual working and unblemished product.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "I LOVE this TV and the shipper CEVA was EXCELLENT!", "Author": "B.

Miller", "ReviewID": "RUWUVUPUF7TPP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon but rarely write reviews. That being said, this TV was so disappointing that I felt obligated to steer potential buyers clear of it. I probably spent 60 hours or more reading reviews, studying TVs in the store, comparing prices, etc. If your reading this, you're probably not so different. In that case, don't make the mistake of buying this television.I settled on the LG 5400 because of good things that I read (hardly any reviews were out at the time) and good things that I saw from a display unit. I spoke with some very knowledgeable TV geeks, all of whom recommended a plasma or one of a few high-end LEDs (including this model). I love my two-year-old Samsung LCD for sports, so I decided to keep it in the LCD family and go with this model. I saw a 42\" calibrated unit playing a Blu-Ray and was impressed enough to buy it that day.It took over a week via free shipping, but I was pleased with my service from the shipper (Ceva). I hooked it up to my DIRECTV and LG LHB335 Blu-Ray via HDMI 1.3b cables and sat back to watch the show. What I saw was borderline unwatchable. Uneven lighting, blooming effects, horrible color, edge glow, artifacts during 120 Hz operation, etc. I spent hours tweaking the settings and trying to convince myself that it wasn't so bad, but I eventually sent it back to Amazon (great service and prompt pickup/refund). One contributing factor that you should be aware of is the quality loss as you increase the size of edge-lit LEDs. Trust me, the 42\" in the store looked like a different television- even the non-calibrated one! Another strange thing is that the box that this TV came in had the wrong specs on it, like a 3,000,000:1 contrast ratio instead of 4,000,000:1. I contacted Amazon and they couldn't explain this, so I contacted LG and they said that the box was wrong. I admit that I may have received a lemon, or possibly even a foreign version. I wondered if I may have received the Australian version because of the box discrepancies and the fact that the model number had \"AUS\" after it, but according the LG Australia website they don't produce the 5400 in Australia. The serial number also was verified as a US television from LG. No clue, but don't take a chance on this TV.In the end I decided to go plasma with a Panasonic 54G25 and am glad that I did. It blows the LG away in every category. If you haven't considered plasmas I highly recommend it. I also have a 42\" Panasonic (42PZ800U) and I love them both.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Television", "Author": "J. Harley", "ReviewID": "RLWP53V9Q445P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to admit, I love this set.  I was in the market for both a 42\" and a 55\" LED television.  After exhaustive research including viewing sets in friend's and family's homes as well as in stores, I decided on LG for both.  I bought an LG 42\" LED LCD and this 55\" model.  Although the 42\" was perfect from day one, the first 55\" I received was damaged.  The right side of the bezel around the screen was bowed outward.  Fortunately, Amazon is fantastic with their return policy and I had a replacement set a couple days later.  The replacement set, so far, has been phenomenal.  Picture quality is out of this world.  The 120Hz makes a huge difference in picture quality.  Several people have already commented how lifelike the movies appear on this set.  Film pictures look like they were shot in video format.  Sports play great with crystal clear images and no blur.  I'm watching the NFC Championship game in HD right now as I type this and it looks fantastic.  Deep saturation in the colors with outstanding contrast.  Not only does HD look fantastic, but SD even looks better than it does on my older LCD sets.  I compared my picture quality to that of a relative's 55\" Samsung (which was MUCH more expensive), and I like my picture quality better. Believe me, I had the money to go Samsung or other \"big name\" if I desired.  Instead, I rolled my savings into a three year warranty and home theater.  The best part is, I didn't sacrifice quality and actually prefer my picture.  Putting smart money to work, especially in a recession.  The sound is also actually pretty good for such a slim set, however, I connected a home theater system to get the most out of my setup.  Even the best sound from a slim LCD won't compare to a more robust speaker system.  I had read that LG uses S-IPS panels in their sets and it's pretty obvious they do.  My viewing angles are great.  LG's LED sets are Internet capable.  They can either work via wired or wireless (with an optional USB wi-fi adapter).  I have the 42\" connected via Ethernet cable, since it's in close proximity of my router, and I purchased a USB wireless adapter from Amazon for the 55\".  Wireless performance is okay, nothing special.  LG's Netcast service is actually pretty sparse compared to other vendors.  I get Netflix, CinemaNow, YouTube, MLB.TV, Picasa, Vudu, and Yahoo.  There are also Yahoo widgets available.  No Hulu or or more popular services other than Netflix and Vudu.  The Internet connectivity is good for software updates for the set.  The set will almost assuredly update the first time you connect it to your network.  Mine did.  There are ports galore on the back, including 4 HDMI ports as well as several USB, RCA, Coax, component, and PC inputs.  The only thing I dislike is the placement.  My particular wall mount blocks the majority of the ports, and I assume several other mount types will do the same, due to the placement of the ports in proximity of the mounting screws.  Fortunately, HDMI port is just below the mount and HDMI 4 is side mounted, so they're the two I use for cable and Blu-Ray.The television is stylish and compliments the room nicely.  Power on and off times are decent and I don't encounter any issues when switching between formats.  Overall, even though it started kind of shaky with the first set, I have been nothing but pleased with the second set.

I have to say, overall I am not satisfied with its quality and am sorry I purchased it.  Several cons: 1)Since day one, when changing channels, picture shows for a moment and then goes snow white for about 2 seconds before it shows the picture again.  Every channel, every single time.  Very annoying. 2)I have the dreaded audio/video sync issue.  The LG blue ray player was included free with the purchase.  I already had a LG DVD 5.1 audio system set up and that worked great with the LG plasma TV this replaced. However, this TV does not sync up unless, while the TV, cable box, and audio system are on, I shut the TV off for a few seconds and then turn it back on.  Sometimes the audio will then sync with the picture and sometimes I have to do this 2 - 3 times before it will sync up. Very annoying. 3) pixelation is terrible on this LED system.  Red colors such as seen during a fire, are really blocky and the scene is really bad.  Also occurs with night time scenes.  My LG Plasma is much better.  I figured a new LED system would pretty much eliminate this, but it is worse.  4) light bleeds from the edges in dark scenes. 5)had to purchase the propriatery LG Wireless USB adapter at an outrageous price. Don't know why I did because the widgets and programs are worthless.  I don't recommend this TV.Addendum:  It is now a year later and still with the same problems.  I have had the cable guy here several times to check my connection as the pixelation continues.  He agrees that it should not pixelate like that, but the cable connection has checked out fine.  We have moved to a new house and the same thing is occuring.  My son-in-law has the 47 inch version and his works great.

My friend has had his for 2 or 3 months, and we simply have different opinions about it. If you are looking at getting a lot of bang for your buck then this is a tv to consider (on sale).  It's a real nice 55\" LED. The picture, tv construction, remote control, menu options, internet applications, and just about everything associated with the tv is pretty good.  The internet setup was simple too.BUT... At this price point I wasn't looking for pretty good, I was looking for great.  I was looking for a new tv and I saw this one on sale so I bit, but here are my gripes.The brightness control is lousy.  I have played with every setting but the tv has issues with finding the appropriate brightness and tries to self adjust while you're watching a program and it is very annoying (yes I have confirmed it's not just my tv, it's the model). This doesn't happen all the time, but it certainly does happen. This is just a massive flaw in the overall quality of the viewing experience which is essentially the only reason you are buying this tv in the first place.Video modes: The menu is really nice, when inputs are available they are colored and when inputs are not available they are greyed out.  My gripe is when switching between video modes (i.e. cable to DVD, it takes forever and a day). Terrible ...no, annoying ...yes.Internet apps: Where is Hulu? My parents just got an internet SONY LED and it has Hulu. That's a big miss for me.Long term quality: TBD... who knows? How long has LG been around anyway?Summary:  Like I said, overall it's not that bad a tv and if this is going to be your first venture into large flat screen tv's, then like most of the people who have commented here, you'll love it.

The blacks aren't quite as deep as you'd find on a plasma, but it's very smooth. Plenty of inputs, great price. It looks good, it's super thin. The menus even let you disable all the lighting on the bezel, which I was very grateful for.The Bad:The internet apps kinda suck. Youtube is slow, and doesn't look great on a huge TV. Netflix is slow, but at least does look fine. These apps are great extras, but I never switch to this mode since I have an Xbox with Netflix that does a much better job.\"True Motion.\" It's important to understand that the video going into the TV is never at 120 frames-per-second. It's a lot less. More like 24 frames-per-second in most cases. Maybe 30, depending on the source. So the TV has to do its best to fake the lesser signal up into something that looks like a better signal. This is a very mixed bag.At first it's very jarring. Video like that often has a \"Soap Opera\" look to it. It can seem to judder or be blurry, but it somehow does feel slightly more \"Real.\" It's a weird effect you have to see in action to understand. The On Screen Menus have controls for adjusting Truemotion- I find the lowest settings produce a great picture that's not -too- weird.Also, this set uses a non-standard power cable. You won't be able to buy a longer one, as it terminates into some kind of weird thin white plastic connector.

You can read all the specs.  I just want to give you a heads-up about the audio.Pros:Picture quality is great: clear, crisp, bright, great contrast.  Light weight TV.  Great price because it can't do 3D and everyone is going 3D crazy.  Easy to get going and easy to use.  Great range of internet capabilities.Cons:I just wanted to warn buyers because I purchased this TV without noticing that something important was missing.  It has NO Stereo Audio OUT connection other than the head-phone jack.  The headphone jack is very weakly powered so this means that you cannot plug in a set of speakers (or stereo with AUX IN) to this TV without a strong amplifier.  However, if you have a high-end receiver with HDMI pass-through or optical audio IN you can used that.  The sound quality from this TV is very poor (no low-end frequencies at all and not much difference in the different \"modes\") so if you don't have the high-end receiver and surround sound you're out of luck.  My other TV is a Samsung Series 7 (model number ends in 750) HDTV and the sound quality from that TV is really great on its own and it also had the stereo audio out jacks (red & white connectors) which I also sometimes use with a external speaker system for movies etc. to get more bass.  Please note the Samsung's audio is reportedly not as good on Series 5 and 6 compared with Series 7.Once I buy the high-end surround sound system I'm sure I'll be pleased with this LG.

Douglas", "ReviewID": "R23PLFRCFR9OPI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG 55LE5400 is my first non-budget HDTV purchase.  The primary reason I picked it was comparable low cost for features, LED backlit, and it fit into my TV stand with 1/4\" to spare. Few other 55\" tv's would fit.The picture is pretty amazing compared to the 42\" Vizio this replaces. Even Sienfeld HD re-runs look great, Bluray movies even more so.  The screen is matte, which was also a requirement for me since the tv lives in a well lit living room. There do seem to be some spots that are slightly lighter when the image is black, but its hardly noticeable for me and really only when there are the black bars on the sides when 4:3 shows are on.The connections coming straight out the back of the TV is a negative for me.  I had to buy right angle HDMI adapters to get the TV to mount in my TV stand which is essentially wall mount. Even then I had to compress the audio and network cable. I much preferred the down facing connections my Vizio had.Another negative (the biggest for me) is that the TV will not pass DTS audio coming in over HDMI out the optical port, which my Vizio would do and never though about checking.  When I asked LG support, they said it will only pass 2ch PCM audio out the optical from external sources, but it is passing Dolby Digital 5.1 from both my computer and Uverse box.  Support said \"that's great\" but said it shouldn't be. To get DTS, I had to run a separate optical cable from the device straight to me receiver and then switch audio inputs on the receiver. While that's ok for me, its not very wife and kid friendly, so I have both audio over HDMI/optical and direct optical set up.I can't comment on the speakers/audio except the above since I am using an external amp and speakers and will never use the internal speakers.  They are very small and fire downward.I tried out the built in apps but wasn't real impressed. The apps were slow and without a keyboard attached, typing words was a hassle. I have a HTPC connected so I doubt I will ever use them.I have a Wii connected and don't have any issues with lag even in a non-game specific setting.The remote is quite large and has a button to turn on back lighting which is nice. Better than most TV remotes I have seen but nothing spectacular.The delivery company delivered the TV early since they were in the neighbourhood, which wasn't a problem.

It didn't include Pandora as a web app. Actually LG's web apps are pretty limited to Sony's. To remedy this, I bought a Sony Blu-ray player with Net Apps which included Pandora and a ton of others that I will probably never use.2. The sound absolutely sucks, but what can you expect from a 1.5\" thick tv? I played with all the settings and couldn't get it to a point that I was satisfied that compared to what I was accustomed to with my old DLP.  To remedy this, I did some homework and narrowed it down to the Sony Sound Bar with a Sub-woofer. I went with the (Sony HT-CT150) which made a significant difference and I am completely happy with it now. I ran everything through the Sub amp (blu-ray, cable, ps3) and it auto-switches when you turn one of them on. It also has pass-through if you don't want to use the sound bar during certain times. one thing that I forgot was to run the optical cable from the tv to the sub, so when I play Netflix from the TV, it doesn't send the signal to the sound bar. I will need to get a friend to help me dismount the tv and run that optical cable through the wall.i mounted the tv to a wall and setup all my components in a closet on the other side of the wall so that no cables ran down below the tv and it is super clean. the subwoofer is also on the other side of the wall and it still sounds great.  i purchased an IR repeater and used double back tape and put the receiver on the side of the tv. the receiver measure about 1\" x .25\", so it is tiny in comparison to the size of the tv and is hardly noticeable. it works great and doesn't need any programming.

LED wins hands down, even at a bigger screen size.  The picture is so stunningly real it almost looks 3D, and that is just on a standard definition 50% compressed ripped DVD.  I can only imagine what BLURAY must look like on this set.  Plus, this set uses the least electricity of the 3 (rated at 165 watts on average), even less than the 32\" LCD panel.Very nice design as well, has a plethora of inputs for virtually the most tech-laden household.  I saw another review commenting on the lack of RCA jacks - this is not true at all, it accepts RCA inputs directly on the back panel, though it does conspicuously lack RCA style audio OUTPUTS.The user-menu is very well designed and makes switching amongst the multiple inputs a breeze.  My only gripe here is the menu only waits about 5 seconds for you to make a choice and sometimes disappears before you react quickly enough.  Anyone complaining about sound just doesn't understand the point of a TV like this.  If you don't hook it up to a surround stereo, why bother?  You don't buy a flat panel for the built-in speakers.  I have no audio sync issues on mine, using either HDMI or component in. One caveat: if the picture appears too dark to you, be sure to go into the setup menu and FIRST turn OFF the energy-saving feature, then if still dark, turn up either the backlight option or the brightness setting.  Mine was defaulting to about 50% brightness out of the box, and the Vampire Diaries looked like it was shot underground.  Turning off the energy saver fixed this problem.  So don't be afraid to tweak the features to please your eyes - this baby can do it all!  Also, as to installation, I was actually able to get this TV out of the box, mount it on the stand and place it all alone.  Any reasonably strong guy can do it alone - weighs roughly 75 pounds with the stand. I suggest lying it flat on a bed to attach the stand and then just lifting it into place.  It's very thin also, thinner than my 32\" LCD.Another nice feature is it has a built in DIVX decoder so you can just attach a USB drive directly to it and play your files right off the drive.One thing I wish LG would offer is a choice of bezel finishes other than the standard black.  A royal red would be gorgeous.  I think I'm in love...  at least this time she's sober.A closing tip of the hat to my AMAZON seller, HOME BUYS PLUS, who demonstrated stellar customer support from the second I placed the order.  Very fast responses to emails, they even tossed in a free USB WIFI adapter.  And the shipper they used, NSD, also did a wonderful job agreeing to deliver the box one floor down in my house, which was above and beyond the scope of their required duties.  Just make sure you stay on top of the tracking.  I had to call the shipper 3 times to finally get it delivered.  It traveled 2000 miles in 2 days and took 5 days to go the last 20 miles, and that was with me phoning 3 times.  All that matters though is she landed safe and sound, and I am very pleased.  Also saved $100 in sales tax by buying on AMAZON.UPDATE: 3/17/2011There are 5 minor flaws in design I need to mention, having had more time to play with it:1)  My biggest gripe:  The TV has no RCA style audio OUT.  It only has a digital audio out, which is difficult to convert for older style amps, or you have to hook into the headphone jack, which cuts off the built-in speakers and subjects you to the volume setting of the TV.  Given the abundance of other inputs available on this set, this is a major omission.  If anyone finds a low cost (under $10) way to convert the digital audio out to RCA type please post a comment here.  I've seen the $50+ adapters - more than I want to spend.2) The remote menus disappear too quickly.  For example, when you press INPUT you get a nice onscreen display to choose from about a dozen inputs, but you get less than 5 seconds to make a choice or the menu vanishes and you have to press INPUT again.  This should be at least 30 seconds, not 5.  If someone finds a way to change this default time setting, please post a comment here.3) The remote is poorly designed, especially the button to move the cursor UP, which is directly below the NETCAST button and you will find yourself accidentally bringing up NETCAST far too often.4) When viewing video files from a USB drive, there are only 2 choices for aspect ratio - either original encoded size (which tends to be tiny) or what the remote refers to as FULL, which for TV shows tends to mean you end up with wide black bars on the left and right of the screen, not a true FULL screen, only maxed out height-wise.  There should be more aspect ratio options for USB files - especially a 16:9 full screen.  It is a nice fast USB interface, though, and so far has played everything I have thrown at it, both AVI and MKV files.5) LG Tech Support is clueless at best, but this is typical of all major consumer electronics companies.  They can't even get the \"email us\" option working reliably on their own website, and heaven forbid you do get through, the responses are never any help at all.  Don't waste your time.6) When listening to audio via the headphone out jack, the on screen audio options to adjust bass, treble, etc are not functional.  Since the set lacks an RCA style audio OUT port and I was forced to use the headphone out to connect to my amplifier and subwoofer, it would be nice to be able to punch the bass up a bit.7) It loses clock settings when AC is disconnected.  If you, like me, use an outlet strip to kill all your power vampires when you are not using them, you will never have the time set on this TV.Granted these are minor nuisances, but in a TV so perfect in so many other more expensive ways, the lack of attention to these little details in the product design both perplexes and perturbs.UPDATE 4/21/11:Still very happy overall, but must add one more CON:CON: Does not play certain .AVI files directly off the USB drive.  Apparently lacks a CODEC or 2.  I worked around this issue by adding a Micca Slim-HD 1080p Full-HD Portable Digital Media Player, which so far seems to play everything, but I prefer the menu interface and remote control of the LG TV to the Micca.

The build in picture settings are decent. I haven't even played blu-ray on it yet and love it. Internet applications are fewer than what you find in some blu-ray players. For example, this is not a compatible device for Amazon Instant Video which (currently, at least) offers streaming video for free if you are a Prime member. Therefore, I picked up a Sony blu-ray player (s480, to be exact) that DOES support this feature. I also picked up a Cisco Wireless Bridge (WET610N, see my review of how to set it up) and combined it with an ethernet switch to provide internet connectivity to both these devices. The point being, I was able to hook up streaming view via the Netflix application built into the TV and watch some streamed HD content.

We really didn't need a new TV, but we had recently seen the seriously vibrant colors of the LED and fell in love.  It is amazing how reasonably priced this TV was (I paid right around $1200 - which was about $500 less than the sale price at blue and yellow).  I was a bit skeptical ordering a TV from Amazon, but I gotta tell you- after this experience- I will never go back to the big box stores; the price was amazing and free delivery right to my door!  CEVA delivered the TV and the gentleman was a true professional.  The receipt he left with me said, \"white glove service\" and that is just what I got.  He wheeled it in, took it out of the box, assembled it and put it up on the stand for me!My husband was at work, so I hooked it up myself and the intuitive programming led me right through set-up.  Many options to choose pre-set picture quality, or a really neat program which easily allows you to set up the picture to exactly your taste.  The only confusion I had was that I tried to use the auto-program feature for the channels and it would not program anything.  A quick call to the friendly LG line and the fellow explained that since I had it hooked up to cable, I did not need to program the channels- it happens automatically.The picture is crystal-clear and vibrant - everything I hoped for and more.  So life-like, when watching the Discovery channel, my dog saw a bird, and quickly marched up to the TV, when the bird flew away, my confused Pete peered behind the back to look and see if the bird was there!  My son is enjoying NFL network and his WII games on the even bigger screen (did you know that you can purchase WII HD component cables for $5 to get your WII closer to an HD experience?), and my husband and I who rarely watched TV are finding time to enjoy it.On the fence?

Researched this purchase until I could research no more. I had initially settled on an LG 55in LCD, because it fit my budget. Lo and behold LG started an instant rebate deal, all of a sudden this beauty was within my grasp !! I did some research on this model LED and ordered. Time from order to delivery was ten days, not bad you say, well the TV shipped from Indiana, I line in Tenn., less than 400 miles, roughly a 8 hour drive.  Back to the TV, it is amazing, set up was a breeze, you will need two people to move this set, not heavy, but awkward. The picture is awesome, and after some tweaking should only get better. The sound is okay, after some adjustments it is do-able. I had considered doing a surround sound system, but that will wait for now.  Size....I had considered going to a 47 (from my 50) but I was advised that given a choice between going a little smaller or a little bigger one should always go bigger. Upon first setting the 55 up it seemed SO big, but within minutes it seems normal.All things considered I would buy this TV again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "I received a defective LG 55LE5400, had tremendous difficulty exchanging.", "Author": "Peter Rodick", "ReviewID": "R2IL5XMEPNWUAM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I echo many of the pros that other reviewers have posted: Crisp picture, vibrant colors, nice apps and feature set. However, there is marked \"cloudiness\" around the edges of the screen, most noticeable on dark scenes (like closing credits). I thought it was a defect, so I returned my first unit and had TREMENDOUS difficulty exchanging (outlined below). However, the replacement has the same \"cloudy\", almost edge-lit look (but this is a backlit TV). Maybe I just got two bad units? LG claims I should not see anything like that on screen. In any case, I can't help but cringe anytime I see it, so now i must return this one as well. I guess I'll try Samsung this time around.There's certainly savings to be had via Amazon; however, I would urge caution when making a big-ticket purchase such as this. I was a little wary of purchasing a TV online on account of the hassle of freight delivery schedules and the potential for added hassle returning the item if it wasn't to my liking. However, the local brick-and-mortar big box store priced this unit a couple hundred dollars higher, so I rolled the dice with Amazon. I lost. And all my worst suspicions were confirmed. Amazon initially sent me a defective unit (\"cloudiness\" in the upper corner of the screen). They promptly arranged an exchange of the item at no cost to me. The first delivery was through Pilot. No problems. The exchange was through CEVA logistics (whom I understand handle most of their freight deliveries). The exchange was a nightmare, and Amazon was unable to help.First, the new unit sat in the CEVA warehouse until a week past the estimated delivery date. When I called Amazon, they called CEVA and informed me that CEVA would be unable to deliver it for yet another week. To Amazon's credit, they acknowledged that this was unacceptable and refunded a portion of the purchase price for my trouble. However, my trouble did not end there. CEVA neglected to schedule a delivery time for the date I was promised. When I called them, they said the earliest they could come wasn't for 4 more days. Then that delivery was cancelled and rescheduled for 3 more days later. At this point it was 3 weeks late. A delivery window from 1:00-5:00 was scheduled. No delivery. I called CEVA. No one answered, so I was forwarded to a call center. They had no answers. I called Amazon. They said they'd forward the matter to a different department. Finally, as I was leaving my house for the evening at 7:30, the truck showed up (they were already 3 weeks late; what's another 2.5 hrs.?).

Zoom would not resize picture proportionately. it would make people look fat.3.
