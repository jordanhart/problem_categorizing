I continue to marvel at the realism when watching High Definition shows. I do not hesitate to recommend this device.At the end of my review I will include D-Nice's review from the AVS Forum. It will provide a technical evaluation for you to judge the 6020.The following is my Amazon purchasing experience... In a pre-purchase call to Amazon a representative confirmed that they are an authorized Pioneer dealer and that `White Glove Delivery' was included in the indicated purchase price.The 6020 was ordered on Sunday and delivered the following Friday. For whatever reason, the order was not coded as `White Glove Delivery'.  I eventually prevailed and the delivery was delivered `White Glove'. Regardless of how handy you are, `White Glove delivery' is extremely important. This type of delivery service requires the delivery team to setup and turn on the TV. When a shipment is left at your door it can be defective and you do not discover this until well after the delivery team has left.  If you receive a defective TV with `White Glove Delivery', one simply refuses delivery; the delivery team will repackage the device and return it to Amazon. Without `White Glove Delivery' one is stuck with a defective TV and must endure the process of repackaging, storing and returning it.When the team unpackaged my first set the screen was covered with spider cracks. The device was repackaged and back it went to Amazon. If there is an issue with the delivery, I encourage you to call the returns department at Amazon that handles Plasma TV's. There is a special telephone number. If you reach an overseas Amazon representative ask for the call to be transferred to this department. This department is located in the States. They are available 7 days a week but are not available round the clock. I ended up speaking with a tremendous representative who was a Supervisor. He made sure that a new order was processed, the `White Glove Delivery' was coded clearly on the order and Amazon provided a substantial discount on the order due to the difficulties that were encountered. I received the replacement TV five days later on the following Wednesday. The TV was delivered in perfect condition. The `White Glove Delivery' team setup the TV turned it on and removed the packaging. I also received two other price reductions when Amazon dropped the price of the set in the following two weeks. (Please note that the price reduction policy is no longer offered by Amazon as of September 1st, 2008. Amazon policies are subject to change. Contact Amazon prior to purchase to review the details of the potential purchase and any expectations you may have.)The issues I had could have happened from any vendor. The difference is that Amazon had a system in place which corrected that matter in an efficient manner with a minimum of inconvenience to me. Amazon also had the best price and delivery options.The picture quality is stunning. I highly recommend the 6020 and Amazon as a reputable dealer.I have included D Nice's technical review from the AVS forum to provide the in depth details of the performance of this TV.Pioneer PDP 6020FD ReviewReviewed by D NiceOverviewKuro (Kuro), the Japanese word for black, defines the core of Pioneer's Project KURO.  Prior to last year, consumers were not privy to have a digital flat panel display that consistently reproduced the absence of color (black).  In June 2007, Pioneer released into the wild a PDP display series that was capable of an unheard minimum luminance level, 0.004fL. This new pinnacle in black level not only provided rich, succulent blacks that true videophiles have been yearning ever since the demise of CRT,  it also was baseline for depth defying colors that to this day leaves me awestruck.  By the end of 2007, the KURO series was herald as the \"best display ever\".  Everyone thought that it would be years before another display hit the market capable of outshining the 2007 KURO series.  No one knew that we would only have to wait 6 months........enter the PDP 6020FD.Panel DesignThe PDP 6020FD continues Pioneer's minimalistic, yet elegant figure with its 57 11/16\" x 34 1/2\" piano black acrylic bezel.  Fit and finish is top notch although the overall build quality is less than last year's PDP 6010FD.  Pioneer also managed to trim panel bulk by 20% leaving us with a slim, 3.7\" depth display.FeaturesThe PDP 6020FD is equipped with 4 HDMI 1.3a ports (three on the back, one on the left  input/control panel), 1 component,  1 S Video, 3 composite, and 1 VGA input.  Although this sounds like a plethora of input options, it's actually less that what its predecessor offered.  However, Pioneer now allows owners to label each input (a big plus). Also new this year on the non Elite KUROs is a network interface port that allows owners to connect and stream video (limited file types), music, and pictures from their home PC/laptop.  Setup and use was a breeze on my network.  However, computer challenged owners may have issues using this feature....especially if they have a home network firewall.Pioneer has also included a new remote with the PDP 6020FD. Compared to last year's remote, the new remote sports a black covering and the layout is more user friendly with the channel and volume controls reversed from last year's layout (finally).Everything about the PDP 6020 reflects the theme \"KURO\".....including the new menu GUI.  Gone is the \"Windows XP\" like menu colors that I have been accustomed to surfing on the previous Pioneer generations.  They have been replaced with a more \"Windows Vista\" like \"KURO\" GUI.Thumbing through the new menu, one will find 7 Preset A/V picture modes and immediately notice a reduction of user controls.  Unfortunately Pioneer has decided to strip the end user of the capability to change the color temperature, gamma, black/contrast enhancement features, and noise reduction.Instead they chose to hardcode these features in what they call \"the most effective combination\".Personally, I think this was a mistake on Pioneer's part.  You NEVER, EVER, take away features that you offered in the previous generation.  Pioneer is also rumored to has gone two steps further by deleting the RGB controls out of the Service Menu (not confirmed as of yet) and changing the sequence to access the Service Menu (confirmed).  These \"castrations\" do not bold well for those who chose not to shell out more money for the Elite KUROs to \"tweak\" their panels more to their personal tastes and/or HD standards. Shame on you Pioneer.I'm sure at this point the question that is on everyone's mind is \"What does the removal of these items have on actual PQ?\"  Well let's find out..........Picture Mode OverviewOptimum ModeOut of the box,  the PDP 6020FD is set to Optimum mode.  Optimum mode is designed to constantly modify the contrast, brightness, color, tint, etc controls based on the room environment.  This year, Pioneer added sound control to Optimum mode's \"automatic\" adjustments.  PQ in this mode was good, but I could see edge enhancement on many scenes and test patterns.  Although I could not get a completely accurate grayscale reading within this mode due to the constant adjustments, it averaged around 7400K.  This will please most viewers during daytime and/or sports viewing as a \"bluer\" white is more pleasing and can add more \"punch\" to the picture.  However, I do not recommend this mode for critical movie and/or night viewing.  This mode is universal, regardless of input selection.Performance ModeNow, one would think that Performance mode would be the mode that makes the Pioneer 6020FD shine.  Well, this is not the case and it's one of the worst A/V modes available on the6020FD.Beyond its S shaped gamma curve (hump between 60 and 80% stimuli), this mode produced an 8600K average grayscale and crushed everything in the 0 10% stimuli range with the brightness control set to 0.  This mode provides improved shadow detail with a brightness setting of +4, but it still is lacking somewhat.  If a 6020 owner previously owed a LCD display, this mode would probably please him as it provides an extremely punchy picture with \"crisp\" (aka edge enhanced) highlights to boot.  Critical viewers should stay away from this mode.  This mode is universal, regardless of input selection.Dynamic ModeBy all means, STAY AWAY from this mode!!!!!!!  This mode is universal, regardless of input selection.Movie ModeThis is the de facto mode on the PDP 6020FD.  It sports an average grayscale of 6350 (6347 to be exact) and a 2.27 gamma.  This A/V mode produces the most accurate picture I have ever seen on a non Elite Pioneer.......ever!!!  All review material and PDP panel shoot out results were done using this mode.  This mode is universal, regardless of input selection.Sports ModeThis is an absolutely horrible A/V mode.  Grayscale is well over 10K with non defeatable edge enhancement and an S shaped gamma curve to boot.  This mode is universal, regardless of input selection.Game ModeThis mode would have been a great mode if it did not have an 8K grayscale.  Gamma is ok at2.17 and it only has minor edge enhancement.  This mode is universal, regardless of input selection.Standard ModeThis is the only mode in which each individual A/V input can house discrete settings.Unfortunately, this is the absolute worst A/V mode available on the 6020FD.  It is similar to Performance mode, but crushed blacks far more.  This is the first A/V mode I have ever encountered on any display that actually makes a 10% stimuli full field pattern look like a 0% stimuli pattern.MeasurementsContrast RatioAgain, all of the measurements were taken in Movie mode (after the 150 hour break in procedure), adjusted for the most accurate picture, and the Power Save mode was set to Off. On a 0% stimuli pattern, the 6020FD can get really dark.  In fact, the pixels literally turn off after 30 seconds on this pattern.  Technically speaking, this means the 6020FD is capable of an infinite On/Off contrast ratio.  However, this 0fL idle luminance is not achievable beyond a 0% stimulus pattern and I will refrain from using the 0fL reading in my official numbers.  Using a window pattern, I measured a peak contrast ratio of 38,900:1 (38.9fL peak white with an astonishing, pre 30 seconds 0% stimuli pattern, minimum luminance level of 0.001fL....the lowest my AEMC813 can go). Full screen white contrast ratio measured 21,300:1 (21.3fL peak white, 0.001fL video black). ANSI came in at 14,600:1.GrayscaleGrayscale averaged 6347 from 10 100% stimuli.  Although this grayscale isn't true D65, I found it very pleasing to the eye and was hard pressed to see the slightly \"redder\" tone on regular content.  Any RGB Service Menu tweaks on this PDP will yield an incremental improvement at best.IRE  Measurement10  613820  634030  635640  638950  637060  642070  634780  637190  6362100  6385Color PointsJust like its predecessor, the PDP 6020FD's user menu does not house any controls that can be used to properly calibrate the colors. On top of that, Pioneer has again chosen to hardcode the6020FD with a wider color gamut (Colorspace 1) which exceeds the reference HD Rec. 709 Colorspace.  The actual color points are remarkably similar to the 6010FD, with oversaturated green and red primaries, greener yellow, and a redder magenta:Viewing AngleThere was no visible drop off in contrast and color from extreme horizontal angles of 75\u00b0 off axis.  However, there is a slight brightness drop off from vertical angles above 60\u00b0.  I must note that I had to be standing 2 feet in front of the panel to see this drop off.Other MeasurementsDead pixels noneScreen uniformity PerfectHDMI Overscan 0% with Dot by Dot and 2% with FullBlacker than black PassedBlack level ExcellentBlack level retention noneVideo deinterlacing ExcellentFilm deinterlacing Passed 3:2/ 2:2 cadence in all resolutionsViewing angle Excellent (> 150\u00b0)Motion resolution 950Digital noise reduction Very good (HD content)Sharpness Defeatable edge enhancement (Movie mode only)Image retention Very minor before 150 hour break in.  Zero after.Posterization Minor with HD cable1080p/24 capability Yes.  No telecine judderPerformance\"My God!  It's full of stars\" would be the slogan I'd use to summarize the 6020FDs performance.Flanked to the left of a TH50PZ800u and below my Elite 1150HD, the 6020FD presented a picture that neither could fully replicate.  Throughout the entire comparison, the following words stayed in my mind: smoooooth, clear, sophisticated, intoxicating.Dark Room HD DVD and BD PerformanceThe 6020FD's 0.001fL black level created an eerie void adjacent to the other PDPs.  I've never seen this much depth and shadow detail on a digital display.  Watching Blackout destroy SoccentAirbase on the HD DVD presentation of Transformers, the black level difference between the6020FD and the 50PZ800u was not subtle, it was dramatic.  Black levels on the 6020FD made thePZ800u's blacks (measured @ 0.008fL) look like a dark shade of gray.  The top and bottom bars literally disappeared into the 6020FD's screen.  In comparison, I could always make out the bars on the 50PZ800u, but their luminance was subtle and much improved over previous Panasonic generations.  Colors during the movie just looked better on the 6020FD. Although the 50PZ800u was fully calibrated to D65 and had better primary color plots, the 6020FD had a certain quality the Panasonic just didn't quite have: a creamy smoothness to the image.  And this feeling remained seared into my sub conscious; even though the numbers say otherwise.  Getting within 1.5 feet of the 6020 and 50PZ800u, I could see an ever so slight level of noise on the 50PZ800u screen.  Engaging the Video NR filter on the Panasonic removed the noise, but killed some of the high frequency detail.  The 6020s picture was void of any and all noise.  Kudos goes to Pioneer for their hardcoded NR filters being setup just right for HD content.Switching to 2001 on BD, the 6020FD continued to create exceptionally dynamic images with life like clarity, super sharp, and super smooth frames.  The white ships on the star filled space backdrop had much more pop compared to both the 1150HD and 50PZ800u.  Black bars again disappeared into the background of the 6020FDs panel, unlike the very, very slight luminance on the 1150HD (measured @ 0.004fL).  Compared to the 1150HD, the 6020 can go brighter when the scene calls for it.  For instance, the space station lobby scene with the red chairs looked noticeably brighter on the 6020 compared to the 1150HD.  For reference, both were calibrated to roughly 39fL peak light output.Watching Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, the 6020 once again spanked the 1150HD in overall brightness level.  Watching the Black Pearl float in the white sands of Davy Jones'sLocker, the sand was actually too bright on the 6020FD for my tastes.  I actually had to engagePower Save Mode 1 to keep the brightness at bay.Dark Room SD DVD PerformanceFeeding all three panels a 480i presentation of Sin City, the 6020FD finally showed some weakness.  Although black levels and dynamic range were far superior on the 6020FD, my1150HD produced a sharper image.  Goldie's facial details were much more pronounced on my1150.  Continuing on with Finding Nemo, Aliens, Star Wars Episode III, and Lord of the RingsReturn of the King produced the same \"softer\" results.  The 50PZ800u with the same material was either on par or slightly worse compared to the 6020FD.  I'm not sure if the lack of sharpness is due to Pioneer coding different NR levels on 480i/p signals or 768p vs 1080p native screen resolution.  This is something I'll have to revisit once I test a 9G Pioneer Elite.HD Cable PerformanceThe 6020FD presented 1080i/720p in the same fashion as HD DVD and BD presentations except that it showed me every single thing that was wrong with the compressed HD signals that broadcasters are shoving down our throats.  Although the 6020FD was capable of showing the tiniest bits of details in static 1080i images, moving scenes were riddled with macroblocking and other picture artifacts.  Dot by dot mode reduced some of these artifacts.  However, it failed to give me the same pristine picture my 1150HD was simultaneously showing.  The 50PZ800u weathered the same issues as the 6020FD.  I guess 1300 compressed lines of resolution from aSA8300HD cable box doesn't bold well on 1080p displays.SD Cable PerformanceSD cable viewing on the 6020FD was just as disappointing as SD DVD performance.  Once again the 6020 presented a softer, less tasteful picture compared to my 1150HD.  Watching SD channels with either Wide or Cinema stretch modes was at times annoying due to the soft picture and took time to get use to.  Artifacts could easily be seen, regardless of channel.  I know many will say that SD cable will always look \"poor at best\" on a 1080p display.  However, I think the people deserve a little better than what the 602FD can muster.Daytime PerformanceThe 6020FD really shines in low lighting environments.  However, its daytime performance isn't anything to balk at.  Pioneer's AR coating kept reflections at bay and on par with my 1150HD.The Panasonic 50PZ800u didn't bold as well.  Black levels remained inky, but I know that aSamsung LCD would have provided \"bezel blacks\" due to its AR coating design.  Never less, I would not call the blacks on the 6020FD during the daytime (with lots of ambient light, I might add) \"grey\", \"blue\", or any other color besides black.  The 6020FD's improved brightness was most valuable during daytime viewing keeping the whites of snow peaked mountains and the ice rinks on hockey games bright and glistening.AnomaliesThere were a number of \"bugs\" reported with last year's KURO series.  Pioneer did address most of these issues, but did not fix all of them (even after I was told that they were corrected): Blotching Still present. Only visible on a completely black screen.Pure Cinema ADV Screen Dimming FixedPure Cinema ADV Screen Flicker FixedBuzzing Power supply buzz has been corrected.  Panel buzz is negligible.ConclusionThe 6020FDs introduction poised many challenges for Pioneer.  Could Pioneer improve on a series that has won more awards than I have fingers to count?  Could Pioneer drop the minimum luminance level of a PDP that to date, no other manufacturer has yet equaled or surpassed?  Could Pioneer create a PDP that expresses a voluptuous color pallet that is second to none?  Is it possible?  Overall, I would have to say yes.  The 6020FD will quench any potential owner's thirst for unparalleled picture quality like no other display I've encountered.  Mouthwatering colors, mystifying black levels coupled with mind boggling contrast dynamics.  Unfortunately, the 6020FD is not without flaws: soft SD PQ performance, paltry number of user picture controls....especially on a $5,500 TV, A/V picture mode performance (minus Movie and Optimum mode) that you would expect on a Vizio, Olevia, or other cheap <censored> display.  However, the 6020FDs overall presentation in Movie mode is second to none.

Otherwise I like to use the TV's speaker. The issue is I don't want to wake everyone up with the loud sounds if I want to watch something and the family is sleeping.  The 6020FD makes this a little easier as the optical output produces audio for everything except \"protected\" content  (whatever that means).  I haven't found any on my Blue Ray disks (via PS3).  However I wish there were more HDMI ports on the back so I could hook all my (current and future) devices up directly.Hopefully with the Ethernet port there will be a firmware update so I can access the display from my Apple Macs and maybe the new Amazon media store.Pioneer has built a nice tuner. However the TV guide is now gone.  Unfortunately the tuner is kind of a waste given that there is no point in buying this set unless you'll have HD content from your cable or satellite provider.So far, I'm very happy.Now I just have to find a universal remote to control the 6020, Comcast STB/DVR, Mitsubishi DVD player and PS3 (and next an Apple TV).P.S.

At $4049 with free white glove delivery, it was a great price. The unit shipped instantly and arrived two days early. The two guys who dropped it off were very nice, but they skipped the part about unpacking and checking out the unit. My wife, who was there to accept, was not aware that they owed us that. So that night we unpacked it to find the glass screen badly cracked. Called Amazon right away and they were very responsive and apologetic. They credited me the $103 white glove delivery cost, even though it was free to start with, then they shipped a replacement. It arrived within a week and was in perfect condition, just in time for the Olympics.The unit itself is gorgeous, as many others have said. The Olympic opening extravaganza in 1080p on that giant screen was jaw-dropping. I have it hooked up through a new Pioneer VSX-1018 receiver that upconverts my Cox Cable box's 1080i signal. So far no issues. Ditto with the Playstation 3 that's also connected through the 1018. I'm not a big gamer, but MetalGear Solid 4 looks amazing on this TV.A big thumbs up for the PDP-6020, and kudos to Amazon for taking good care of me on the delivery.", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "J.

I ordered mine from Amazon (through 6thAve).  Enough has been said about the white glove delivery service.  It is hit or miss.  If you dont order through Amazon you will not get it.  In other words be prepared to have it delivered to your front door and that is all.  I received my TV about 2 weeks after ordering it.  I asked the delivery guy to wait while I unpacked it, just to check and make sure it wasnt broken.  He offered to take the packing material with him when he left.  I declined (as I keep all my boxes for my AV stuff).  VERY IMPORTANT!  Do not let them take the box and packing material.  I set my TV up taking great care to make sure everything was aligned and hooked up properly.  Momment of truth and when I switched it on....nothing but a loud buzz and no picture.  I of course went back to the manual and found nothing indicating anything was wrong.  Called 6th Ave and they told me to contact a local pioneer repair shop.  Called the pioneer repair shop and they told me to get a new TV (after explaining the situation).  Had to call 6th Ave back and they were gracious enough to send me a new TV.  They dropped the new TV off about 10 days later and picked the 1st one up at the same time (thus the reason for my recommendation for keeping your packing material/box).  Now about the TV...Do yourself a favor and get this TV.  Even after the aforementioned issues I would still highly recommend this TV.  The picture quality is second to none.  The HD channels are flawless and DVD's look phenominal.  Even SD channels are good.  I am planning to switch from cable to DirecTV in the next month or so and am guessing the image quality will look even better.  The on screen menus are pretty easy to use and hooking up your other AV equipment is relatively simple.

Pancerz", "ReviewID": "R13CVMZEHB1KR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this set from Amazon over two months ago and have waited until now to add my review.  The initial delay was due to DirecTVs 4 week waiting list to hook up their HR22 high definition DVR to this amazing Pioneer Kuro set.Since I was forced to watch standard def images on the 6020FD for almost a month, you can guess the difference a high definition picture made.  I can not add to the superlatives mentioned in the other reviews with regard to the Pioneer Kuro.  The colors are vivid and the images literally jump off the screen.  I didn't understand all the talk about the color \"black\" and how it's different from plasma to plasma but I do now.  Want to really be blown away by this new tv?  Punch up one of the kids channels available in high def like Disney or The Cartoon Network.  The color saturation on these animated shows is not to be believed.  Even my kids are impressed by the set.Here are a few caveats for the White Glove Delivery as I too, had a few issues.  First, working with Amazon was a joy with regard to this order.  The problem I had was with CEVA when they called to schedule delivery.  I asked them to verify the White Glove Service and they did NOT show that in their files.  A quick call to Amazon fixed everything, no problem.  I would recommend checking to see if White Glove Delivery has been selected.Secondly, the two guys who delivered my set were excellent unlike some other reviews I've read here.  I've found in life if you treat people nicely with respect, often times you'll receive better service.  The old adage of attracting more flies with honey as opposed to vinegar.  They brought the set in, removed it from the box, placed it on the table where I wanted it, and powered it up (even though I had read the online Pioneer manual weeks ago).  All I did was offer them a few sodas for their trouble.One final thing to remember is that the speakers are packed below the set.  I hooked my 6020FD to some speakers that I installed in the wall and almost let the delivery guys take the box away as they were leaving.  Am so glad I didn't as they would have been throwing away the Pioneer speaker enclosure for the set.  Don't make this same mistake!!!I'm now in the market for another plasma that will be placed in our game room.

First off, the 'top of the line' Samsung LCD that maxes out at 55 inches is the UN55B8000.  It currently (today) costs $3600.  I purchased my Kuro for 3697 all in and is listed at 3700 today on Amazon.  So that's $100 difference.  Half the price is a comment made by an idiot.  It is half the wieght of the Kuro - certainly not half the price.  The differnce in the 5 inches (55 to 60) is 19% larger area for the Kuro screen-wise.  For me, I did not want anything smaller than 60 inches.The picture of the Kuro is near perfect out of the box.  Put it on Optimum and you are good to go.  Digital looks pretty good and HD looks amazing.  All visitors comment on the HD picture.  90% of what I watch is HD or blu-ray so it works for me.  Right now I am watching a digital channel (Fox Soccer) and it looks very good - not perfect, but very good.I have watched various movies from a PS3 on the Kuro - Iron Man was stunning, Star Trek II (daytime) looked perfect, even upconverted dvds look excellent.Lighted conditions is where I was surprised - this TV works very well in lit conditions, anti-glare screen works very well - I have light bouncing off it now and there is 0 reflection on the screen.It is very heavy - so I have not wall mounted it yet.  That is going to be a project and I likely will have to hire a couple of insured installers to do the job.  Keep that in mind.Also, my wall mount did not fit - so make sure your wall mount fits the specified holes on the 6020.There are screen splotches when it is off - no big deal - part of the plasma experience I suppose.Do not touch the screen - you are only supposed to clean with the supplied cloth - does not perform miracles.  So, try to keep the screen pristine.I have used the movie mode settings found on internet, like from here and CNET - they work very well - so does simply putting it in optimum mode.Optimum is great and is one of the truly awesome aspects of this model.HD is almost 3 dimensional, almost.  It is stunning from 1 inch to 12 feet away at any angle.I have not used the included sound bar so can't comment on sound.Laptops look great on monitor - I have used VGA (Windows-based) and HDMI (macbook pro) - both looked very good - even watched a TV show off of netflix via the VGA - it was fine, not blu-ray, but good enough.I cannot get split screen to work the way I would want it to.TV is almost too easy to operate - Once I discovered how to power it on, the picture looked great and continues to.If picture looks bad, make sure you are on HDMI option and not simply the cable feed (if you have a cable feed going to it for some reason like I do [trying to get split screen to work])I would not use other modes other than optimum and movie, I do not see any reason to, but hey, that's me.P.S. - nobody who has seen the screen thinks it is 'dim' - this screen is quite bright.  For those who own it and think it is dim - there are control settings you can manipulate to make it brighter - mine, however, is perfect and not dim at all - the whites in fact are very solid and not 'smokey' in the slightest - something is wrong perhaps with your connection or input if any of your colors, white included, look 'smokey' on this plasma.", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV's  But shipping is a rip off", "Author": "OLD JR \"jrw\"", "ReviewID": "RNKIVAZVCPA1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought 2 of these babies and love them !

Durant \"AV addict\"", "ReviewID": "R1T9353TOBOWL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I have to give Amazon (and CEVA, the shipper) kudos for their white glove delivery service.  They gently carried the tv up my icy driveway, brought it in, un-packed it, made sure it worked, and offered to take the packaging away (I declined).  And they arrived in the first hour of the 3 hour window, which is always a bonus.  Definitely place your order through amazon, not one of their associated merchants.  It was worth the extra $50-$100 (at the time I made the purchase).First off, I want to mention that plasma technology has come a long way recently in reducing the weight, and profile of the panels.  This 60 inch display only weighs about 10 lbs more (without speaker or stand) than my Samsung FT-P5084 50 inch display, despite being 20% larger.  I was able to life the TV from the stand, to a wall mount with my wife's help!  Didn't even have to call a male friend!  The display also has handles on the lower back side, to save your hands from sharp edges.  The holes for the bolts on the back of the display are 34 inches apart, which is wider than my old wall mount (and most of the universal wall mounts out there).  So, even if a universal mount claims to be capable of holding a high enough weight/panel size for this display, make sure the wall bracket is at least 36 inches wide, or it will not be able to accommodate this display!The stand is cheap, and relatively crappy for the price of the display.  This doesn't bother me, obviously, because I've mounted it on my wall, but it's an obvious bit of cost-cutting that's a little disappointing.  Also, if the speaker bar is not attached, the display is supported by two skinny little bars, that are rather unsightly.  If you are going to use the stand, make sure the speaker is attached, even if you aren't planning on using the TV's audio.  Because I haven't attached the speaker, I can't comment on audio quality.  All the reviews I have read said that for a TV, it's pretty fantastic.  But I've got at least $3 grand into my surround sound system, so I didn't even bother taking the speaker out of the box.The TV itself has a high-quality, black gloss finish around the glass that looks like it belongs on a TV this expensive.  The remote is ok, not great, but not bad.  Lots of small, same-size buttons.  The black, brushed-aluminum-type finish is nice, though.  I use a Harmony One universal remote anyway, so I'm not worried about the TV remote.  The TV's menu system is fairly logically laid out, although some settings that you might think you'd find in the picture sub-menu are actually in other sub-menus.  It took me a little while to find my way around, and play with all the various settings, but there is nothing too confusing about the setup.  The menu screen sets the current video feed into a little box on the right side of the screen, with a border around the whole screen, and the menu items on the left side.  Selecting the picture-related sub-menus brings the video to full-screen and overlays the sub-menu on top of it.  It's a little different than other displays I've used in the past, but it works.The menu you'll spend the most time in is the picture menu, under setup on the main menu.  There are a bunch of color/picture modes available, but the only three are actually watchable for any period of time: Standard, Optimum and Movie.  Standard and Optimum have similar default settings, the main difference being you can tweak the settings in Standard mode, but not Optimum.  Both have reasonably accurate color settings, and high contract ratios that really make an image \"pop\" off the screen.  Standard lets you adjust contract, brightness, tint, color and sharpness manually, while optimum makes adjustments for you based on lighting conditions.  For showing off what the display can do, Optimum seems to be the best setting.  The whites are bright, the blacks deep (more on this later), and the colors are quite vibrant.  The only problem is that, in a darker, more ideal setting, Optimum and Standard modes are a bit fatiguing on the eyes after a while.  It's just too much contrast for your eyes to handle comfortably.  The definition, accuracy and video processing are top rate, meaning good video feeds look fantastic.  Poorer feeds, however, can look a little less than spectacular, however, in these high contract, high detail modes, because they accurately reproduce the images, flaws and all.  Even with the sharpness turned all the way down in Standard mode, this is still the case.  Letters can appear pixelated, not smooth, and standard def TV feeds just don't look good.  So, my TV is currently in Movie mode, which I feel (and there are several professional reviews to back this opinion up) is the best overall viewing mode for the TV.  The colors are more muted, but closer to accurate, the contrast is excellent, but not fatiguing, and the mode smooths out the lousier feeds, while still showing the details of the good feeds in nearly all of their glory.  A word about the color: at first, everything looked a little greenish, compared to my Samsung, which was calibrated to be as close to accurate as possible, but any adjustment in the tint toward red made the picture appear pinkish.  I was unable to make any adjustments that seemed to get to a color that was 100% accurate, and that seems to be the only downside to this TV, versus the Elite models.  However, after watching the display for a week, my eyes/brain have adjusted, and I no longer see the greenish tint, and the colors appear completely accurate to me.  I'm not saying this is the best solution, but it works better for me than spending the extra $1,500 to $2,000 on the Elite model.  A professional calibration would probably help as well.  Regardless, I'm quite happy with the color at this stage, and I'm picky when it comes to my displays.And now the most important part, the black levels.  I think this is the best way to describe it:  you can't tell the difference between when the display is turned off, and when there is a completely black screen being fed into the display.  It makes anything else I've ever seen look gray in comparison.  If you are new to TV/video-mania, you should know that there is no substitute for deep black levels.  All images displayed on a screen are simply different color and intensity lights arranged in shapes that we perceive as whole images.  Those lights stand out in contrast to the relative absence of light (ie, black) displayed elsewhere on the screen.  If your screen's absence of light is just a medium gray, the screen has to output more color and more light to equal the contrast produced by a screen such as the kuro.  And there are limits to the technology (and to human sight) that don't necessarily allow that to happen.  So having the deepest, darkest basis to contrast with is extremely important if you truly want the best image possible.  And, in normal viewing, this display, and the other kuro displays, simply have the best black levels available in a flat panel today.  Samsung and Sony have LED-backlit LCDs that score better on contract ratio and black level tests, but in normal viewing situations, they simply can't match the Kuro line.I don't think the question is whether you want to buy this display or not.  It's entirely a matter of the cost/benefit analysis.  If you are nuts about your home theater, and the thought of spending 4 grand on a TV doesn't scare you, you will not be disappointed.  On the other hand, Panasonic and Samsung make some excellent 58 inch plasma displays, for significantly less money.  As long as you never saw the black levels on this Pioneer, you wouldn't even know what you were missing, and would probably be perfectly happy. But, with the exception of the Kuro Elite models, the PDP-6020FD and the PDP-5020FD are probably the best displays money can buy today.  I don't regret my purchase one bit.", "Date": "February 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "KURO was King in flat panel displays without a doubt!!", "Author": "Mark A. Dillard", "ReviewID": "RS503XNEXB1K6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just recently purchased a PIONEER PDP-6020FD 60\" KURO plasma panel to add to my stable of aquired KURO's.This makes number four PIONEER plasma for me, my stable includes: PRO-111FD 50\", PDP-5020FD 50\" (upgraded board mod), PDP-4270HD 42\"and the aforementioned PDP-6020FD 60\".The 6020 is on par with my Pro-111 sans the extra color, along with noise reduction and other controls. I will soon rectify this by doing the I/O board swap and will gain full picture control just as in the Elite models.Moving up to a Kuro 60\" was always my final goal after only having the 50\" and 42\" versions. It took quite a few years to come across a deal I could live with and this year was it.After living with my Pro-111 50\" as my main viewing panel for movies, concerts,VHS, Laserdisc, DVD's, Blu Ray and video games for 3 years going to a 60\" panel makes my frontroom surround setup feel much more like a theater than ever before. Since having a pretty narrow living area seating/viewing is about six feet away from this monsterous, humungous screen. I know saying that today is a little strange since there are 70\", 80\" and 90\" panels easily available. But for me it is truly huge. My concern as far as the panel being possibly to large for my small quarters has been put to rest. Another thing that concerned me was getting the 'screen door' effect going to a 60\" and sitting so close. With my 50\" I never experienced the 'screen door' effect since these days the cells are so much smaller than the early plasmas. Again my worry was put to rest just as I powered on the set once I had it setup in place of my 50\". The picture is as vivid and detailed as it ever was but with a much bigger viewing area.My choice was a good one and fits my wants and needs for movie viewing and video games. If I have problems with the 6020 I will either seek out another or try to get a PRO-151FD 60\" panel in it's place.Many years back when the Kuro line was announced from Pioneer I lusted after these great panels, but the prices kept them out of reach for me for many years. Price is no longer a factor and nailing a good price on a used set is not hard to accomplish these days.I know most want a brand new panel with a warranty but for me I want a specific brand with legendary picture quality and reputation. So here I am purchasing panels that are years old, which to me is not a problem.I figure they should last just as long as a 'new' set purchased today with my limited use of them.My first Kuro panel purchase was back in 2010 with a PRO-111FD that was a new out of box static display at a theater store.The rest have been used buys from various sources, from ebay, pawn shop to private owner.So far no problems what so ever and looking forward to many more enjoyable years of a legend in the TV industry.If future problems occur and repairs cannot be made I have my 50\" panels as backups to continue to enjoy the picture quality only the Kuro can deliver.I have been a huge fan of Pioneer since I first heard the name and saw my first Pioneer product around 1976. So naturedly I was gravitated to their video products after amassing a rather large collection of their stereo and audio offerings.For this review I will not go over all the details that have been more than covered here and elsewhere on the interwebs. If you are reading these postings you probably have a good idea of the PIONEER KURO reputation. So I will leave it at that.So call me crazy for pursuing 5+ year old panels but after starting off with an obsolete PDP-V402 480p 4:3 1998 plasma and moving up to a 2008 PRO-111FD Kuro video entertainment has not been the same!So I'll stick with my Kuro's for now and enjoy the now legendary quality that was on top of the flat panel hill for a few years before they decided to bail.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pioneer KURO: Last of its kind", "Author": "Auggie", "ReviewID": "RUOD5Y3YK9CZE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this knowing that this is the end of the line for Pioneers' big-screen TVs, and also knowing that this TV is approaching almost 2 years old since it's original release date.  But from all the reviews, the KURO '20-series was the one to get for its deep \"blacks\" as well as its vibrant, rich colors.After a month, I have not been disappointed neither.  The picture is absolutely STUNNING.  No pixelation, blockiness or graininess, nor ghosting or strobing.  Just breathing taking detail and fluid motion.  I've looked at Sony Bravia's and Panasonic's, but after watching the latest in Blu-Ray movies on this stunner, I have been taken aback by its crystal clear and silky beauty of its 60 inch video presentation.  None of the others has compared next to this majestic beast.  And it hasn't yet been calibrated, which is scheduled in a couple weeks.I won't go into all the technical reviews of this machine as I'm sure you can find much more eloquently and technically accurate writings elsewhere.However, I will go into a little nitpicking that was not mentioned by anyone else during my research.1) The audio Digital Out (optical) only passes 2-channel (stereo) Dolby Digital or PCM.  I was annoyed when I first hooked up my PS3 HDMI to the KURO, then the KURO digital out to my AV receiver only to hear stereo.  After contacting Pioneer, I discovered to my disappointment that the KURO only passes 2-channel.  In fact, I found out that practically all TVs that include a digital out send only 2-channel.  (sigh)  I had to connect an optical cable from my PS3 directly to my AV receiver to enjoy anything beyond 2-channel.  Unfortunately, I do notice just a slight audio timing shift from the video image.  Almost imperceptible (and for most people, unnoticeable), but I do notice it.  On top of that, I have more cables to mess with, as I have a DirecTV box and Xbox 360 in addition to my PS3, which means I have to have 3 optical cables going directly to my AV receiver (and ensure I switch to the right input on the AV receiver), which I'm lucky to say has more than enough optical inputs to handle this mess.  If the Digital Out could pass the full, unaltered audio stream then it would require only 1 cable going to the AV receiver and setting it to the same input regardless of what I was showing on the KURO, or maybe it's time to invest in a multiple-HDMI-input AV receiver (money, money, money)...2) The programmable remote is rather unremarkable and difficult to read in low-light situations (especially for those that are far-sighted).  But who are we kidding; if you are one of those that spends $4k+ on a TV then you probably also have a high-dollar third-party remote (the Harmony One for me) to control all your big ticket toys.  I keep the factory remote safely tucked away for emergencies.3) The on-screen interface is spartan.  There aren't too many features to change on this machine.  I do wish that it had auto-sensing inputs, like the Sony Bravia's, which would clearly indicate which inputs and type have connected devices on them.  When I initially powered-up the monster, I had to go to the back and refresh my memory which ports are the HDMI ones I used (the back HDMI inputs are 4 through 6, with port 7 HDMI on the left side).4) Sound quality was very good for two-speakers, but no where near capable of a true 5/6/7.1 surround system.  Again, if you forked over $4k for this behemoth, you probably also have a killer audio system to go with it.  I do wish that the front speakers could be set as an input to handle the center channel, like my deceased Mitsubishi Diamond 65\" RPTV.  Instead, I have to hang an independent center speaker below the built-in speakers (I don't usually use my audio system when watching regular TV so I need the built-in speakers to work).5) Be careful what you wish for.  The blacks are the \"blackest\" I have ever seen in a TV.  Unfortunately, I also noticed that some scenes can get too dark to discern certain details (for instance, the bold black headline of a newspaper in the shadow such as in the movie, \"The Watchmen\").Besides those points, I am completely satisfied with its video performance.  And with the \"discontinued\" signs beginning to be foisted on this last-of-its-kind, killer deals are sure to be had for those wanting the best.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Super Image, beat expectations.

It may not be the best TV for converting from SD, but even converting from the lowest of resolution it still show no artificial digital artifacts.  Meaning, no hyped colors, no rainbow effects, off color shadows etc.The color depth is also stunning.  May be a bit strong on reds and greens but seems to be pleasing to the eye.  As advertised the black levels and detail are where it's all at.  Making colors rich, deep, accurate and shadow detail solid.  Blacks are inky black.  For Plasma is does have a decent anti reflective coating.  Reminds me of anti reflective coating on video lenses.  Day time viewing is not a problem at all.  TV speaker is better than the average TV speaker.  I use 5.1 surround system for Blu-ray and HD TV but, for average TV viewing it's decent.LCD and LED sets are using fast motion reproduction ie...120hz, 240hz to help stop motion blur.  To me this makes 24fps film look like video.  24fps is supposed to show motion blur at certain speeds, and trying to make everything look sharp makes the picture look unnatural.  This set show no signs of this artificial \"fix\".  Blu-ray, broadcast 1080i shows (sports) look amazing.  Smooth, fluid...the way they were meant to be seen.

The first decision was LCD again or Plasma. I asked many people about it and eventually decided on Plasma and I very glad I did. Colors are much truer and great for gaming too as there is no noticeable delays.The other decision was whether to buy a Kuru or a normal plasma. If you are not sure about this I would strongly recommend the Kuru technology. The quality of the image is outstanding.However the most difficult decision was whether to go for the standard (this one) or the more expensive PRO-151D. In the end i decided to go with the lower price option (difference in price was quite high), but I was quite concerned that the quality was not ideal. Once I plugged it in, all of the worry disappeared as I found the quality excellent and although I have no doubt the PRO series is better, I find it very difficult that it can be that much better to justify the difference in price.Buying from Amazon was a great experience. Tv arrived in 4 days. I was contacted to organize time of delivery and installers were there in time and were most helpful in setting it up.If you are looking for a great hdtv, I would strongly recommend the Kuro series.

Not pretty!Updated review (STAY AWAY):I bought this TV and at first I loved it great picture and sound... The best actually! However in less than a month the TV got so hot it burnt the anti-glare off spots on the front. I reported the issue and after 4 months I got Pioneer to get a Pioneer authorized dealer come out and look at it. They stated \"this is definitely a manufacturing defect\" and they submitted the claim to Pioneer.Pioneer stated \"We've tested EVERY POSSIBLE scenario with our TV and it is impossible for the TV to have a defect with anti-glare, the authorized dealer means nothing\". In turn I have a very expense TV with spots of anti-glare burn holes on/in it.STAY away!!!!!!!!!!!!They're going out of business for a reason. They sell you on paying for the high quality and top notch performance, but if you do get an issue they will state you are the reason and you're left holding the bag. Get a Panasonic or a SAMSUNG LED.Week one review:I wanted a large screen for my big room (52 or greater) so I looked at it two ways , I could look at buying a TV that would be sufficient/average quality and picture and save some dough or invest a few hundred more and get a top of the line TV.I researched endless hours online and by talking to different electronic people (tweeter, Authorized TV repair shop technicians, not big box employees) and after doing extensive research the answer was pretty clear.The pioneer won in every category picture, quality, etc. and when I started asking all of the above people every one of them had a Pioneer (Elite or 60X0) except one who had a panny.I got my 6020 this week and the thing is awesome it blows my Samsung LCD away. The LCD even with 120 gets blurry during sports and fast action, the colors are overly bright/driven sometimes. Don't get me wrong the Samsung LCD is nice and far better than most, but it couldn't even hold a water bottle for the 6020.If you don't want to play with settings for room brightness, color, or sound just set the TV to auto and let it go as it will out perform on its own what the best fiddler can do with any of the others.I did look at the 800 and the 850, but after doing using the monster picture DVD (several images with random colors held for 10-15 seconds so you can few the same picture on each TV) it was pretty clear as to why the couple hundred buck investment needed to be made. The 6020 shows multiple levels of back and color shades. When they state about the blacks and the difference they make have a vendor show you a similar test. Also there is a domino test where you can see different shades of blacks as the domino picture fades away on a plasma you see them all (and on the 6020 you see more clarity than the panny) and on an LCD you see half as the LCD overshoots the blacks so bad they get saturated.In summary I can say that I've owned the 6020 for about a week and I'm some glad I spend the extra and got the Pioneer it was WAY worth it. If you're on the fence don't be as your going to have it for several years and use it more than anything else in your home so short changing yourself will only make you regret your decision.

I purchased my first set through amazon with White Glove Delivery and when they unpacked it we found that the screen was broken ... big disappointment.  Anyway we decided not to reorder straight away as we were going away on vacation and after about two weeks Amazon issued the credit back to our account ... which I thought took too long.Eventually we reordered and this time the set came through 6thAve and here again we were told it would be White Glove.  The local delivery company then called us and told us that they would only bring it into the house and not set up the TV.  We explained the previous problem so they said they would unbox it so that we could check it out.  Anyway, the second set was fine and we then had to get a neighbor to help us with the installation as the TV weight around 150lbs ...  too heavy for the wife.We have it now hooked up with an HTIB and a PS3 for BlueRay and we are extremely happy with the KURO.

Probably if you are the editor for Home Theatre magazine and like to mess around with color controls then possibly there may be an issue.

I have been tracking this technology for two years trying to convince myself to shell out the $$ to upgrade my old set. The trend in LCDs was clear. They were looking better and better, but with this improvement, most vendors' higher-end LCD sets have shiny screens! The ones with matte screens looked terrible by comparison. The glare with most of the new LCD sets is similar to, or worse than most plasma sets. I also found that when trying to decide on which LCD to purchase, I simply tried to find one that didn't look too much worse than a plasma. Don't get me wrong, many LCD sets look good, but, with the exception of animation, high-end plasma sets look better.After careful consideration, I decided to get a plasma. The clincher was that I compared a bluray video on the latest Samsung LED-backlit 55\" set to the same disk played on a Pioneer Kuro pdp-6020fd. Looking at the LCD first, I thought \"wow, that black suit coat is really black!\" When I viewed the same disk on the Kuro, I thought \"wow, that black suit coat is not just a black blob without definition, but has subtle wrinkles that are completely invisible on the LCD.\" The local dimming used on the latest LED-backlit LCD screens removes all of the subtle detail in dark scenes. I also noticed that the skin tones looked cartoonish on the Samsung LCD compared to the Kuro.Now that I have enjoyed the Kuro 60\" for a few weeks, I still am amazed at the unbelievable detail and the amazing blackness of the screen. I am also pleasantly surprised at how cool the screen runs. The lack of glare on this screen was also amazing. The anti-reflective coating does a great job - not as good as the older matte LCD screens, but much better than my old plasma or the newer LCD screens.Note that most wall mounts will not work with this set. This includes ones that claim they can handle sets of this size. The bars that mount to the TV simply are not long enough. I ended up ordering the Sanus VMPL3b through Amazon, which worked great.I have only one minor complaint: When using the \"optimum\" mode, which adjusts the color temperature along with brightness based on room lighting, you don't have any control over the overall brightness and contrast. The pre-set levels for these loses some of the detail in dark images. It is a shame that I can't tweak these settings. This is only a minor complaint; the solution is simple - just use one of the other settings. The light sensor still adjusts screen brightness automatically.Overall, I am VERY pleased with this set.

Well when the truck arrived, he was by himself. Asked about white glove service,he did not know any thing about that. The container looked in good shape so I accepted it. I called the amazon customer service concierge team and informed James of the situation. He gave me a few options, return, call shipping company to pick up or I could assemble it. For my trouble I would be given a credit  of $103.52. I had no trouble assembling with the clear instructions that came with it. I'm satisfied with everything the way things turned out.

He helped me put the TV on the cabinet but would not connect it.  After I connected it and got a picture on it, he picked up the packaging and took it away. It's a good thing the White Glove service didn't cost anything or I would be asking for a refund.  The TV itself is perfect in every respect. I would recommend it to anyone.

It seems like the picture quality gets better everyday.  My house has many windows and I was worried about picture quality with the brightness in the room.  The picture adjusts to the brightness, the quality is great.  I also like the sound as to the fact where the volume does not increase during commercial time.  I have noticed some ocassional picture distortion or rather the picture trying to come thru like when you don't get a clear signal, and also an ocassional  skipping of a word now and then - this dosn't happen often but I would like to know why it happens.  Also on the remote, I do not have a button that says \"info\" to see what channel is playing.  Minor issues.  Overall I really like this TV.I would caution about the company you may call upon to set up your TV on the wall (The TV does come with a stand which is good). I paid the ZIP company that poped up when I purchased my TV from Amazon offering a price comprable to BestBuy which included service and bracket.  I thought this would be good but I wound up paying $199.00 more because they did not send the right bracket.  I understood that a bracket measuring for a 43\" to a 63\" TV would accommodate my 60\" TV - it didn't! I was then told that I would have to pay for another bracket to accomadate this brand of a TV.  I do not know if this was just a line I was given, nevertheless I had to pay extra for another bracket which they did not even accept to exchange the other bracket with one that would fit my TV.Amazon's White Glove service is impecable!!  It would be nice if other business would learn a thing or two from how Amazon dose business.

Shannon", "ReviewID": "R19CD2887SUL88", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for nearly two months now.  I am only using it to watch HD and standard broadcast via Dishnet.  I bought it as a flat panel replacement for an old HD-ready rear projection Toshiba 61\" 4:3 monster (it still worked fine, but it just wasn't working in our new house). The viewing area has medium light from north windows.  Based on the room design, viewing distance will range from 12ft at the couch to 25ft or more at the dining room table and kitchen.I had spent a couple of months researching the various forums and realized that I was going to have issues regarding the size of the TV that drove me toward plasma, versus the brightness issue that would push me toward LCD at the expense of size.  I went back and forth for a while and finally decided to go with the best-reviewed plasma at the premium price.The quality of the picture itself is outstanding, as long as I'm watching from 12 ft or closer,  although it still seems like I'm watching thought dark sunglasses.  The whites look more smokey than white.  Antiglare is very good.  However, for longer viewing distances, the dim picture becomes a signficant issue.  I've tried playing with the various picture presentations and tried cranking up the brightness at the expense of the \"deep blacks\".  Best compromise has been \"Sport\" mode with nearly maxed out brightness setting. This TV would be great in a dark viewing area with fixed viewing distance, but did not work for my viewing arrangement.  I would have done better to have bought a quality 52 or 55\" LCD. If I ever build a home theater room, it will work great.By the way, the purchase through Amazon went smoothly.  I could have saved a couple of hundred through another site, but went with the free \"enhanced\" delivery and peace of mind.  They unpacked it in the house, but because it was less than 50 degrees outside, could not turn on for a couple of hours.  So all I could attest to was that there was no apparent damage and let them move on.

You would think that a company that markets to informed customers that are willing to spend for QUALITY???? would attempt to do something for an owner at 13 months (1 month after the warranty expires). Instead, I was informed the only effort they would make is to give me the closest Pioneer service center. Thanks for the $[...] repair Pioneer. This is made even more sour by the fact that Pioneer changed the power supply after their first delivery of plasmas.
