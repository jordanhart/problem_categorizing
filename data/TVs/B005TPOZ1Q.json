{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Dr James Nichols", "ReviewID": "R3NRISD4PML6BR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this tv because I needed a 12 volt tv for my RV.  Although I would have loved a bigger size, the cost was too prohibitive.  However, when the tv arrived, it turned out to be the perfect size for the space I had to mount the tv.Several reviews I read commented about the sound being too low.  I have not noticed this problem and my hearing is not the best.  I can hear the tv volume just fine!  The picture quality is great and the tuner picks up a lot of digital channels.I highly recommend this tv model and may order another one for the rear bedroom in my rv.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$269.68", "Features": "22 TV (21.5 Viewable) Slim LED Backlight and Built-In DVD Player.\n1920 x 1080 Resolution with 16.7M Display Colors and ATSC/ NTSC.\nBrightness: 250 cd/m2 Response Time: 5ms.\nA/V Playback: PAL / SECAM / NTSC.", "Name": "Skyworth - SLC2219A - 22 TV/DVD Combo with LED Backlighting and AC/DC Power", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FHK7F2BRL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005TPOZ1Q"}}
