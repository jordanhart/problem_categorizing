{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic!!!!!!!!", "Author": "tribaltat \"tribaltat\"", "ReviewID": "R1M9S1PBHKD6Y1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been living with a Panasonic PT40LC12 LCD projection TV since early 2002.  Originally, it had a great picture...but, over the years (and 2 bulbs later) the quality of the image has deteriorated significantly.  In all fairness, this set is used , on average, about 6-7 hours each day...so, it really owed me nothing.  Also, it maxed out at 480P, and didn't have HDMI.  So, I went out in search of a replacement.  I've been looking at current models for about a year and finally decided to get this Sony.I've had it about one week, and after spending some time tweaking the picture settings (there are a ton of user adjustments available) I finally sat down and watched a few DVDs.I've got 2 DVD players and the first film that I watched was viewed at 480P using the component inputs.  I had seen the same film before and wanted to compare....the image was absolutely fantastic.  Although the DVD was a movie, the image looked more like live video.  The depth of the image blew me away...the color was perfect...it looked almost like a live network feed.The next DVD was viewed at 1080I using the HDMI inputs.  Again, the image was outstanding.Adjusting the set is not for the faint of heart.  The Vivid and Normal settings are, in my opinion, way too bright...too much contrast and color intensity.  Although it appears that they can be adjusted...why bother.  They might work if the set were being used in a sports bar, or other venue...but, not in the home.I concentrated on the Cinema and Custom settings.  There are several blogs, technical sites, etc. on the web that discuss adjustments for this set.  It's really worth the time to hunt them down.  One thing I read was that the 120hz scan feature only works in the Cinema or Custom settings...and Sony's \"out of the box\" default is to have that feature turned off.  So, make sure to check the settings for the inputs you're using.I concentrated on getting the best image in the Custom mode for each of my attached inputs.  I found that \"WARM 1\" was the setting that provided the best \"live looking\" image.  WARM 2 (the default for Cinema mode) gave the image a look that most closely mirrored a movie theater experience.  If you tweak the Custom settings to give you the most \"live looking\" image...you can use the THEATER button on the remote to switch into a more Cinema looking image.Also, it appears that you can adjust the levels for each input...so, you can tweak the picture for each device that you connect without changing any of the others.  Although I have an outstanding AV receiver which does 1080P video and audio switching (to which most of my components are attached), I found that where multiple device outputs are available, attaching any device directly to the TV allows the picture to be customized specifically for that device....you can still use your surround sound receiver for the audio.The remote control is somewhat complex (including a hidden compartment at the bottom with a sliding door).  It also took a while to learn to navigate through the various setup and adjustment screens...but, in a short time, it really all made sense.Viewing my standard definition DirecTV channels was OK....I haven't gone to HDTV as I need to chop some trees to get the proper angle and elevation for the 5 LNB HD dish.  However, if the HD channels come in as great as the DVD images, life will be beautiful.I don't, as yet, have either a BluRay or HD DVD player....as soon as the industry decided which will be king, then I'll decide which to buy......and, the prices can only go lower with each passing day.  I've seen BluRay DVDs played over this TV and all I can say is...I can't wait to get mine.All in all...I think I made the correct choice.  It was probably the most expensive set that I considered...but, if it stands up over the years, I think it was worth the price.  Also, I'm glad that I waited for the XBR4.  The previous XBR model wasn't nearly as attractive (e.g., that ugly silver surround).  Also, Sony added many improvements (if you can believe them) to this newer model.  If you decide to get one of these...please take the time to study the owners manual.  Although there are some unexplained and confusing descriptions, it will at least give you a place to start.UPDATE...I've had this set for about 2 months now...It only gets better.  I purchased a blu-ray player and now watch all my DVDs upconverted to 1080P.  Watching blu-ray DVDs at 1080P/24 is the best I've ever seen (even in the stores on their demo sets).  The \"clouding\" issue reported on the previous XBR2/3 doesn't exist...so it appears that Sony did solve that problem.", "Date": "November 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing Journey, Fantastic Television", "Author": "SG-CEO Advertising Agency", "ReviewID": "R26RJXHJ3240S7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, some basic insights I gained while shopping for this television.The last LCD HDTV that I purchased was not a top brand name.  So when it suddenly died, with a \"crackle...pop\"noise, I googled the sound to learn it was the power supply unit. And not an uncommon occurrence.  Just google \"lcd tv crackle pop\" and look at all the results.I took it to a number of very high-end A/V repair shops that refused to work on it, since they \"didn't have a manual\".  I called everyone, including the manufacturer.  But they were focused on their current models and since they weren't name brands, had no reputation for...anything, and were not going to not about to be helpful.  So much for LCD TVs that aren't name brands.  Or those without warranties.  So unless you intend to make your HDTV a disposable one, go for the brand name.Second, LCD TVs are not computers or audio components.  Not even iPods or iPhones.  During my quest for the best television, I found that all the HDTV models changed quicker than the price of coffee at Starbucks.  I visited one retail outlet that was selling 5 different Sxxxxxx LCD TVs on the floor and 2 more in their \"high-end\" room.  All 7 models had been introduced within the last 12 months. Do not expect this trend to stop.By the time you own your unit a month or two, there probably will be a variation of a higher model that's become your current unit, or your unit will have been upgraded by a letter in the alphabet or numerically.  You won't have the \"latest or greatest\" for very long.  But don't worry.  You'll still love what you purchased.And just as I was about to buy, I was frozen by the audiofile forums, on \"banding\" and \"clouding\" issues.  For the Sharp and Sony monitors, respectively.  But with the fast introduction of new models, those problems were corrected by the time I went to buy, just a month or two later.  Now that's simply amazing to me.  What other industry is introducing 5 models within 12 months? Check it out.  Nobody could make this up.Next, we have the internet vs. the retail models.  Virtually the same model numbers with a few minor variations.  Why?  Because many of the retail stores offer \"match pricing\" but can't match the prices on the internet.  There may be \"servicing\" differences also, but I can't confirm that.  From my research, the manufacturer's accommodate the retailers by offering internet models with internet pricing.  They don't have to price-match with the internet models.  We're not just looking at a few hundred dollars, either.  Sometimes I saw price differences of $600-$700 or more.But you have to know exactly what you're doing online.  Or get off.  I guarantee that you'll be sorry.I learned to stay far far away from Ebay for some products, and this is one.  Many of the \"Power\" Ebayers sold models that were discontinued, but were \"new, in the box\", which was probably true.  And often timed their sales with the release of a new model.  They used this confusion to help them sell.  Also, I found many of the exact models for hundreds less, elsewhere online, like Amazon, but without the urgency of shopping Ebay.  I found that it wasn't what the \"Power Sellers\" were saying in their ads.  It was what they weren't saying that was frightening.I purchased one HDTV on Ebay and after the sale closed, I got hit with a whopping insurance and delivery charge. I didn't care about my Ebay \"star\" or my 100% record perfect record going back 5 years.  I told the company that I'd charge it back and issue a press release.  They backed out.  But I had to be willing to do it, and they had to feel it, before they did it.Don't try that at home.Without a doubt, the safest place to buy is on Amazon.  I shop with security, confidence, and I know their return policy will be honored.  I can safely say that.  One company I ordered another LCD TV was a third party vendor on Amazon.  After patiently waiting for almost a month for delivery (I'm very busy at work) I got a little suspicious.  Sure enough, they were off Amazon's list.  And I was a casualty.  But within 2 days, I had the funds credited to my account.  That really impressed me.  Of course I had to make a commotion.  But things have really changed since 1999.  Seriously.  It's a different world now.  But Amazon was real.  And they came though.So if you plan to shop anywhere for an LCD TV, please use Amazon.  I could  go into missing pixels, Mexico vs. Japan, shopping for warranties at Sonystyle.com, cable vs. satellite, etc.  But I think I've bored everyone.And those I haven't bored, I've insulted.  So I'll leave it at these 4 final last points.  First, the size of the LCD TV you will purchase looks about 250% bigger at home than in the store.  Remember that.  Second, we finally decided to purchase the new 32\" Sony XBR4 (non-1080p) for the bedroom and the 40\" Sony XBR4 1080p (Sony Bravia XBR KDL-40XBR4 40\" 1080p LCD HDTV) for the living room and we're thrilled.  Due to digital satellite, the images on the analog channels have great resolution.  I don't see any \"grainyness\" whatsoever.  And the 40\" Sony XBR4 1080p that we purchased for the living room is amazing.  Gorgeous.  Third, we're approaching Christmas, and I'm watching prices go up the last few weeks, and that includes Amazon.  So either buy today or if you're budget conscious, plan on waiting until January, after the holiday season.  Fourth, I look at the reviews knocking the \"cinema\" displays and laugh.  Don't sweat the small stuff.  Amazon, this took me hours to write, and if you post all 10 paragraphs, you'll be my heros.", "Date": "October 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "excellent -- worth the money", "Author": "CS", "ReviewID": "R2WR5NXAWKZ0US", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I concur with the other reviewers, this is an excellent TV (Sony KDL-40XBR4).  The picture is gorgeous, especially with HD input (1080i or 1080p).  Even looks good when watching VHS tape!  The only problem is that some analog tv channels just look plain bad (grainy and fuzzy).The controls are sensible, configuration and customization (e.g., input labels, picture/sound settings) are easy.  The remote is a bit bigger (longer) than I'd prefer, but that's a minor quibble.Yes, possibly you'll pay more for this one than some others.  And sometimes a know-it-all salesperson will tell you that X or Y has much better reviews from \"experts\".  For my money, I always find that the Sony in the store has the best picture.On LCD vs. plasma, perhaps that's more a personal thing.  But I don't find the \"black level\" argument in favor of plasmas particularly convincing.  And I like watching 4:3 without stretching, so I'm not about to risk burn-in on a plasma.  So I only considered LCDs.BTW, the EagleGL shipping service used by Amazon for this was ok.  They gave us a 4 hour window and were more than an hour late, but other than that no problems.  (Mine was easy -- ground floor, 10 steps from the front door.  So might not apply for every case.)", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC TELEVISION", "Author": "William M. Gibson", "ReviewID": "R283RVF5KY8Y0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the opportunity to try a couple of HDTVs.  First, I bought the 37\" Toshiba Regza 720p.  It was ok, but I definitely wasn't blown away like I had hoped.  Once I made the decision to go 1080p, I bought a Sony 40\" W3000.  Huge step up from the Toshiba, and a definite buy if money is an object, but but once I saw how good it was, I wanted to take the final step and get the top of the line 40\" XBR4.  What held me back was the price difference (an extra $500-$600).  I kept my eyes open, and when I found a deal on the XBR4 (more later),  I pulled the trigger.Set up was extremely simple and took less than 5 minutes.  Literally took it out of the box, plugged in the power cord, connected to my satellite receiver via HDMI (a must), turned it on, and was watching tv.  I must say, that the picture quality of the XBR4 is stunning.  Like night and day with the original Toshiba, and noticably (although not dramatically) better than the W3000.  HD stations are simply awesome.  Crisp, clear, well balanced color and contrast.  SD stations are obviously not as good as HD, but still VERY good.  I am sure that I can improve even further on HD and SD quality once I do a little teaking, which I haven't had the time to do yet.  If you buy this tv, do a quick bit of research on the internet.  There are several forums where people offer tweaks that they say improves the already fantastic picture. One thing for sure....take it off the Vivid setting immediately (this is the default setting out of the box).  Way too garish in my opinion.I have this tv in a relatively small family room, and I do not have it hooked up to a surround system (nor am I planning to).  Sound quality from the onboard speakers is very good, and unless you intend for this tv to be the center piece of an elaborate home theater set-up (which you probably won't since its a 40\" tv), you'll be perfectly happy with the sound.  I am.  Will you rattle the windows and shake the walls when you are watching a movie?  No, but if that's what you want, then go ahead and hook it up to your surround system.  There are a variety of inputs (3 HDMI, 2 component, 3 composite), so you won't have any problem connecting to your system.How about the much touted Motion Flow (120h) technology?  I'm still playing with that, but so far, I don't notice much of a difference.  When you set it to high, I do notice what others have commented on, that the picture looks almost too good (i.e. film looks like live tv, which is not necessarily a good thing).  I have to spend a little more time looking at different content with and without the Motion Flow turned on to see what the difference really is.Looks?  I really like the glass frame that goes around the entire screen.  It is purely a matter of taste, so you have to judge that for yourself, but my girlfriend said it best (\"it looks really classy\").Fan noise that others mention?  Zero for my set.  I turned the volume down to a very low level, and listened carefully, but I didn't hear a peep.  Perhaps if you live in the country, with absolutely no ambient noise around you, you might notice something, or perhaps this is something that Sony has addressed in the latest builds.  Either way, I can only tell you that I didn't notice anything.Worth the extra money over other Sony Bravia models?  I have to say that the M and S models are definitely the low end models, and I think you can tell.  The V model is next in line, and its a noticable step up, and many will be happy with this line (check out the V3000, or if you want the best possible price, check out the older V2500 which can be had for close to $1000 in some places if you look hard).  The W series is a further, noticable step up, only slightly below the XBR4 in my opinion.  For most everyone, this set would be perfectly fine, and if you can get a deal on a 40\" W3000, then buy it.  You'll be happy.  And finally, the XBR series.  While it is a step up from the W series, the difference is not large.  Some might even say the difference is minimal.  In my opinion it might be worth an extra $100-$200 just for the few extra features, slightly better picture quality, and cool looking glass frame, but not worth the $500-$600 difference that most retailers are selling it for.  As I mentioned at the start of this post, I was fortunate to get a great deal.  I got Best Buy to price match an unbelievable price I found on the internet (not Amazon), and I ended up paying $50 more for the XBR4 ($1849), than the sale price of the W3000 ($1799). For $50 more it was a no brainer, but given that the price of an XBR4 at Best Buy is $2299, I wouldn't have paid $500 more.  Even with tax, it was $55 cheaper than the price on Amazon, and I had the instant gratification of walking out of the store with the tv (sorry Amazon, but I still love you).Are there any downsides?  None that I have found yet.  It is simply an amazing tv. It is Sony's top of the line, and it shows.  Don't be sucked in by Sony's latest model, the XBR5.  As far as I can tell, and as far as every salesperson I have talked to knows, it is literally the same tv with just a different frame (which I didn't like as well as the XBR4).  Check out the specs.  They are identical.The nutshell....if you're on budget, go ahead and get the V3000.  I think you'll be pleased.  If you have a little more money to spend, get the W3000.  It's very close to the XBR4, and you'll be very happy.  If you have the money, and want the best, get the XBR4.  You're paying mainly for a *slight* picture quality improvement, extra features like Motion Flow, and the glass frame, so its worth it only if you get a good deal and its less than $100-$200 more than the W3000.  Anything more than that is not worth it in my opion, and I've had both tvs so I speak from hands on experience.", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great picture, but pricey", "Author": "Irv Haas \"dvdirv\"", "ReviewID": "R33XE9RO064IXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony KDL-40XBR4 which is at the top of the Bravia line has an improved picture over last year's XBR2/3 series including a better color palette and better refresh rate.Sony's main improvement with the refresh rate is what they call Motionflow, which is a 120Hz refresh rate that delivers smoother movement with movies and animation.  The better color palette provides an overall better image.The style of the XBR4 is better with a black bezel replacing last year's grey bezel.The downside of this LCD is the lack of a true PIP (Picture in Picture) 2-tuner capability.  It does have PIP, but this feature lets you watch 2 inputs at one time, but not two programs since there is only one tuner.

I'd like to comment to all the 'noisy fan' people: First off, it's really not that bad the way people describe it... it's a low ambient noise that you could hear when the sound is very low (under 10) and the room is completely quiet. And second, did anyone read the manual? It's not a defect -- it expressly says on page 47 of the XBR4 manual in the troubleshooting section... Condition: There is a whirring noise, Explanation: This is the sound of the internal fans of the TV. It is not a malfunction.With all the negative press on these \"noisy fans\", I considered returning it.

These were the only two items I planned to attach to the TV.  I wanted to watch my beloved Patriots win in high-def.Research:Based on Consumer Reports, it seemed to me that Sony and Samsung were the best brands, with Sony a bit ahead.Price:Samsung seems to be cheaper in general, but I chose the Sony becausea) the Samsung I was looking at had some sort of triple effect when watching footballs fly through the air.  To fix would have required me to upgrade the TV's softwareb) Sony's tv seemed to have more speakersc) I liked the look of the Sony TV betterI went to the pricescan website to see who had the lowest price on the model I wanted.  That and bizrate feedback helped me to decide who to buy from.Other items:a) To hook up your new TV, you should buy a power center (Monster brand is not necessary...a knockoff is fine).  The higher number of joules the better.  Expect to pay around $120.b) You need an HDMI cable to go from your cable box to your tv.  I got mine for free from my cable company, Comcast.  Otherwise it is about $12.c) You could get an extended home service warranty, your choice.  Sony's warranty doesn't include home service or shipping prices.d) To have picture-in-picture work I think you need a splitter for the coax.  I say \"think\" because I haven't tried the feature and don't see myself using the PiP option much.The tv was easy to set up since I had limited components to attach.  My tv faces LOTS of windows/light, but reflection is at a minimum.  The fan noise is apparant when the movie/show has only voices and the sound level is under 10.

When paired with HDDVR and HD service from DirecTV, the broadcast images are truly impressive.  I have not spent much time to tweak the picture, but used the \"standard\" setting which is more pleasing than the default \"vivid\".  I haven't purchased a Blue Ray DVD yet, but it's on my list.  In the stores, the HD DVD picture is unparalleled in resolution.The set-up for the TV is fairly straightfoward for those who are familiar with the typical AV set-up.  For those who are unfamiliar, it might be worth spending the money to have a commercial set-up of your home theater system, since the coordination of audio and video connections to the AV receiver is not always intuitively obvious.  I have a Denon receiver, and the instructions are challenging even for the sophisticated owner.The delivery from Amazon was just as good as claimed by other reviewers.  They take the TV out of the box and will assist you with simple set-up, and provide general advice.  If you need more, then you need to get extra help.A hint - if you upgrade your DirecTV service to a HD satellite and HD-DVR, you can pay the installer $20 to program the remote to control all the components.  Not only did he do that piece (which is actually well-described in the instructions), but helped with all the AV connections.  Much less expensive than having someone come out separately.Another hint - I found that the height of the TV with the stand was actually about 1 inch higher than stated in the specifications.

I still own a SLHF-1000 Beta VCR, and this XBR is replacing a 27\" Trinitron as my main television (which is still going strong after 12 years, and will for many more, undoubtedly).  I finally caved in to the modern era when I found this TV for $1349 at a major big box retailer.  Now is the time to buy XBR4 models, as the new XBR 6/7 models are about to be released, and if you can find the XBR4/5 on clearance.Although Samsung shares some components and R&D; with Sony, it's not just the LCD display you're buying when you buy a Sony.  It's the other electronics, firmware and other important aspects, too (and it plays nice with other Sony equipment and remote controls you might have).  The Sony picture looks better than any Samsung I've looked at.  Sony is simply the King of the LCD TV Hill, just as Pioneer and Panasonic share that reputation on the plasma side.  In my opinion, you simply can't do any better.Pictures are very good out of the box on Standard video setting; although, \"Vivid\" is apparently just for the showroom, or for someone who wears sunglasses while watching TV.  Audio and stereo separation is very good for in-TV speakers (hence the much wider bezel compared to many lesser sets with skinny speakers on the side, or cheat and place the speakers underneath the screen).  A friend's Samsung TV's speakers rattle and distort like a crappy 20 year old RCA, and analog channels looked just horrible; analog pics on the XBR look almost as good as on my tube Trinitron.  Buyers of Vizios and other cheap manufacturers are today's VHS 8-hours-on-a-T120 crowd, while the real video aficionados who used to buy Betamax, EDBeta (or maybe SuperVHS) are now enjoying XBR LCD (or Pioneer plasma).With the 120 Hertz refresh rate, motion blur is almost unnoticeable.  For less blur and quality of picture, you'd need to go to a high-end plasma.Concerning the comments of a couple reviewers:  I hear no fan noise (and there is a Sony fix for earlier-manufactured sets with that issue). At least, the Sony does not have Samsung's huge problem with TVs turning off by themselves that require a firmware update.I highly recommend this TV (or it's big brothers in 46 and 52 inch) highly, especially if you can grab one for a clearance price.", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Simply the best 40\" LCD on the current market", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3BCVGEBXZHQUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As many have said before, my wife and I did extensive research prior to this purchase.  The closest competition, in our opinion, was the Samsung LNT4071F. It is a hard decision when the competition has a TV with similar features and quality...and a price difference of about $500.  However, the reason we bought the XBR4 was that we own another Samsung and Sony LCD, and we believe that the Sony Bravia processor provides a slightly better overall picture quality.  If you can afford the difference, go with the Sony.  If not, you will be happy with the Samsung and you will never know that the Sony provides a slightly better picture.The white glove service that Amazon provides is through a company called Eagle.  They will contact you and set up a four hour block for delivery.  They arrived in the last half hour.  They carried in the box, unpacked it, set it on our TV stand, and did the initial setup after I plugged in the cables. I recommend that you have everything ready, including the required HDMI cable.  It just makes the process go that much smoother.Two other comments: 1. The factory picture setting of \"Vivid\" is the best for us, as we use Comcast cable HD .  2. Don't forget to keep track of the 30 day price guarantee.  We have received three refunds already for a total of $88, and we still have 10 days to go.

I have purchased numerous items from Amazon, but was always a bit hesitant about a purchase of this magnitude.The delivery experience:Well folks...I must say that I'm impressed with Amazon and of course the television itself. First of all, it only took 4 working days for the delivery, the guys brought in the TV and set it up to ensure it arrived intact, and hauled off the box...way cool!The television:I currently only have standard cable, but somehow this TV has detected (to my delight) about 35 digital stations, and around 8-9 HD stations. Needless to say, the XBR4 will pop your eyes out watching High-Def channels. The standard def channels actually look surprisingly good as well. I was a bit skeptical about how good the SD channels would look, but I discovered that the XBR4 displays them quite well. The 120Hz is worth every penny! I've watched a boat-load of football games and other sporting events and never noticed any of the pixellation present with 60Hz TV's. Sound quality...no matter what broadcast you're watching, the sound is superior to any other TV I've heard. And there are mumerous settings for those of us who enjoy customizing everything (picture, sound, etc.).DVD Component interfacing:I must say the the standard DVD's I have look surprisingly good as well using the standard component connection. But my DVD burner has a 1080i upconvert feature, so I hooked it up using HDMI. Again, looks pretty darn close to the Blue-Rays I saw in the stores. (Of course it's tempting to run out and buy a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD to take full advantage though!!).Bottom line...don't hesitate.

Sony's LCDs have the richest black of all the LCDs, which mostly explains their superior picture. This Sony has the best blacks and colors yet. I also appreciate the uplevel connections, esp the vga computer connection and the internet possibility.After watching the display at the store, I expected great things out of the 120hz.  But  it actually produces some very weird viewing glitches. First, I suspect this review will only be useful to those like myself who do not pay extra for HD cable. My connection is just the simple RF cable plugged into the TV. It carries both standard digital and analog signals to my Sony. The Sony tells you on the screen if the channel you've selected is \"analog\" or \"digital.\" It labels the digital channels as standard def or HD (even though I don't have HD it upconverts the HD defined channles to 1080). It produces exactly what I hoped when upconverting to HD - an amazingly crisp and crystal clear picture. But when there is some fast movement from the subject on the screen, the HD picture becomes bizzare - jerky and gittering as if the processor cannot handle both the upconverting and fast movements at the same time. I doubt those who pay extra for HD cable boxes will have this issue, although I did read some  professional reviews before buying the set that strongly  criticized the 120hz for creating an unnatural looking movie pictures. I don't know what's worse - watching the programs in a less high quality and more grainy definition on my old Sharp Aquos, or putting up with this weird jitter on my screen whenever fast action occurs. The jury is out, and hopefully I can find some remedy to this so I'll be happy all the time watching my new Sony.Still, I have no regrets.

I will concur the local std def ABC/NBC/CBS look worse than the TV it replaced, a 16 year old 36\" Toshiba. Even the local affiliates HD versions of their SD content (like General Hospital) is pretty pathetic in Tampa, FL. If your sources are mainly these types, you may not want to take this rather expensive plunge. However, I find myself avoiding watching the SD channels now, as the HD Discovery is pretty jaw dropping quality. Football is kick butt awesome.A couple related comments: Verizon's recent upgrade in their FIOS TV puts a pencil thin green bar on the right of this and Toshiba TV's (maybe more) if the tv is set to fullpixel mode. You may also see some of the vertical interval (blinking on top edge). On this tv, set the display to \"normal\" and it will enlarge it just enough  to take it away. Verizon says they will be patching this flaw (and others) over the next few months.I use the Verizon Media Manager to feed slideshows of digital photos I've taken from the computer in the bedroom to the Verizon PVR. While even a 16x9 aspect photo won't fill the screen, the area that is covered is big enough on this TV and of excellent quality. I generally tune the cable box to a channel I don't subscribe to first so I get a black border on the unused portion of the screen. I mention this, as sometimes it is nice to just put on music and run a slideshow while relaxing at home. If you have lots pf digital photos, I recommend you try this option.7/08 A little followup - I've noticed the Sony Bravia engine does nice things compared side by side with non Bravia LCD TV's.

The Bravia pictures truly look like it was window or portal through which you can reach through and touch the characters. It was **unbeleivable**.- I happened to be driving across the USA at the time and hence, I stopped by 3 more Circuit City or Best Buy stores in different cities. Confirmed that the stunning Bravia picture quality is due to the TV alone (and not due to variation in connection or poor feeds etc etc). In each of the stores, I checked out the equivalent Samsung LCDs and the picture quality was no up to par.- Received my Bravia today (amazon delivery was effective) and yes, the picture quality is truly stunning (I am using a HDMI)Conclusion: At time zero, the Bravia is a clear win!Additional thoughts on impact of Blue Ray:- Using the Bravia with a PS3 (40Gb) box as the Blue Ray player. As a test to confirm what all the Blue Ray hyperbole is about, I loaded a rented Blue Ray DVD \"3:10 to Yuma\" and of course, the picture quality was stunning. I also happen to own the regular DVD version and when I loaded it immediately for comparison, I really cannot see any degradation or significant difference.

Again, I went to the various sources (including reading various reviews on Amazon) as well as talking to a couple of friends of mine that had recently purchased this product.The HD pictures are top notch.

If you take the refurbished TV, our warranty and extended warranty are null and void. We wanted ours fixed.

I was so worried about those things when purchasing this XBR and I just crossed my fingers. I've had it for about a month now and I hear no loud fan noise or see cloudiness. This is a great buy from Amazon. The picture quality is amazing especially from a PS3 blu-ray 1080p movie! It will blow your mind and you will get hooked! But the TV is not perfect though, nothing is. Be very careful with the glass acrylic bevel it scratches very, very, very easily. Take it from my personal experience do not use a used microfiber cloth unless it is brand spankin new straight from the package and only going to be using it once. Lucky for me I made a very faint minor scratches near the logo to wipe off some finger prints. It's not too bad but yes I was very upset with myself. Now the only part I have left is to find the right HDMI 1080p cable to hook up to my DVR. The cable I got from a popular site that everyone recommended because of the cheap price is not working. I still get static pics on HD broadcasting channels. I would try my HDMI cable from my PS3 but I'm hesitant because I think that the cable is only for the PS3 and I don't want to mess up anything by connecting an incorrect cable type. I hear some say you should use the same brand cable as the the TV manufacturer. So if it's Sony use Sony.
