Having only one Audio output is problematic for people who desire more freedom.Plus all of the input and outputs require the included adapters, except for the HDMI plugs.The adapters are strange, non-standard and unalike from eachother.These adapters \"cannot\" be found in stores as well.Oh, and you \"can\" turn off the motion plus feature. This feature speeds up all programs running through the television. It's so very annoying. Some feeble attempt to make it seem more real or something.If you can hook the television up without breaking anything and then leave it alone, you will be very impressed with the picture quality.Every movie you have ever watched will need to be re-watched on this television.I am so happy with this television that I actually feel guilty when just listening to movies while doing other things.By the way, you can save $500.00 by purchasing this television at Costco.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Amazon VOD", "Author": "me too", "ReviewID": "R3ADTELTD62PQ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "TV is loud when you turn it off.

Torres", "ReviewID": "R8NCTHB2DGISA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have read a lots of review about how bad is the sound in LED TV, but this one is not in that group. For TV shows you don't need to turn on your home theater system, just change the sound mode in the menu. And the images of this TV are crystal clear. If you want to play games you have to select that mode in the menu because if not it will reacts with lags.Other plus, it include the WiFi USB device.The only CONS is that Netflix doesn't work.When it get the upgrade firmware it will show you the Netflix channel but when you select it, it will give you an error message. But because I bought a Panasonic Blue Ray with apps I have no problems with Netflix.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lousy TV", "Author": "Ignats \"Ignats\"", "ReviewID": "RHDTR2M56U2LD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "LCD went bad after a few months.

You are confined to the apps Samsung filters and presents to you (Accuweather, Pandora, HSN, BBC, etc - none of the interfaces I viewed were as good as iTunes Apps). Loadibng the apps is painful - a web/PC interface would be nice in place of the remote. It does have Hulu and Netflix (one of them may have insisted Samsung redact Amazon - who knows!). NOTE - this is as of 11/29/2011 - it's possible that Samsung will update available Apps to include Amazon at some future time.Otherwise, a nice (albeit expensive TV). You can download a iPhone app for the remote which is also cool. For me, I refuse to pay $850 for a TV that is not 100% current, and this one is not.FYI - Costco has this TV in a 240hz version for $839.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Have it for 10 months and Going great!", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R3QBO69Q5EPOXI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this TV for almost a year and it is going great. The TV is stunning, lightweight. Have several HDMI ports and USB ports. I can connect USB harddisks and watch movies/pictures. It can play high resolution WMV files. It cannot play 1080p wmv files, but 720p files. This is not a big deal for me as I can always play a  blu ray or 1080p DVD. I have this connected to a Yamaha RX 571 receiver, a Blu Ray player and also a VCR. I have also connected to a OTA antenna. It looks elegant and picture quality is good. I don't use the SmartTV that often. I rely on a Google TV or my Panasonic Bluray apps. without a QWERTY keyboard, all of the smart apps are difficult to navigate and search.
