Once I set up the TV I turned it on only to discover a red spot on the screen, what I later learned to be dead pixels. Amazon graciously offered to send me a replacement, so I packed up the original and sent it back only to receive a TV that showed up in a previously torn and poorly-patched box. The replacement worked great for just a couple of days before completely shorting out and showing nothing but a live black screen when it turned on. Couldn't even get the menu screen to load.

I'm a bit of a techie yet I am not an early adopter, more like a very late adopter. I make a point to never pay full price if I can help it. I think I'm pretty adept at being able to hound out a good deal. MIGHT have found it in this tv.First heard about this tv through a tech savvy friend. He bought it for $260 had it shipped overnight. He is very satisfied with the tv and thought it a great deal for the money, as good/better as other $500 to 600 dollar tvs.After reading ALL of the customer reviews, I felt that this might be the tv for me: bang for the buck. When it became available again I ordered one on Tuesday 12/27/11, went with the free shipping option, and recieved it today 12/29/11. Pretty fast shipping.The customer reviews stating the tv was DOA and did not power on irked me a little before I ordered, but Amazon has a pretty fair return/refund policy, and it comes with a two year warranty, no worries right? Unboxed, set up, and plugged in later in the afternoon. Wouldn't you know it, the tv was DOA. Wouldn't power on.I went throught the Amazon return/refund process online, boxed it back up, and UPS will pick it up in the morning, and hopefully I'll recieve a replacement in the next few days. HOPEFULLY ONE THAT WORKS. Fingers crossed.The tv not working might have something to do with the tv being upside down in the back of the UPS truck, box looks beat to hell, and three out of the four styro packing blocks at the corners (top and bottom) were broken or cracked, and the corners of the box indicate how that may have happened.I was looking forward to watching some movies and playing some xbox this weekend. damn it.I will follow up on this review and update as the situation develops.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------12/30/11 1:44P UPDATEEven though I went through the return/refund process yesterday afternoon, UPS picked it up today about an hour ago and provided the return shipping label as well, didn't have to print anything, and I left the original shipping statement unopened on the box.UPS guy took one look at the box and said \"oh, wow. they're sending you another one right?\"Which they are. It shipped out this morning at 8am. I am more than satisfied with the turn around and ease of use of Amazon in this matter. All in all I have to say that their return/refund process is fairly painfree. Other than having to box it back up, but that only took a few minutes. If it ships out similar to the first one, more than likely I'll receive the next one tomorrow afternoon sometime.I remember reading a customer review for this tv where he had recieved two DOA tvs back to back from Amazon.....I am not overly perturbed by this. Amazon or UPS is the one footing the bill to ship around broken tv's.It comes with a two year warranty as well, not too worried about it.The tv out of the box looked exactly as advertised with the correct amount and types of hookups.The glass base is nice and attached simply and easily and has a nice heft to it.It looks like a really decent tv, the form does fit the function.A thought/opinion about the quality of this tv: I havn't seen it in operation yet but the outward appearance of it seems like any other normal tv. It's not an objet d'art, nor is it meant to be, yet it will suit my workaday aesthetic just fine. Besides, i think the upper price ranged tvs look a little gaudy and pretentious anyways. This tv is more in keeping with my small apartment and budget.Talking about how 'pretty' a tv is reminds me of the fancy wood cabinet floor model tv we had when I was a kid.If your worried about that with a tv like this for this little money then you may want to rethink having champagne tastes and a beer budget.Let's get over ourselves ok?My experience so far: some light reading shopping around, order tv, recieve a broken tv, return/refund process, UPS picks up broken tv.The heavy lifting I've done so far: nil. well, except for unboxing and reboxing, meh.Total time invested: a few hours. ON MY BUTT. CRUISING THE INTERWEBS.Just have to put a little trust in Amazon, my own judgement, the other customer reviews, and the process.If I don't like the working tv I eventually will recieve, then I will return it for a refund.I might yet get a nice bang for the buck tv. I'll keep ya posted.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------12/31/11I recieved the replacement tv around noon today. Just unboxed and setup and it's up and working. Will spend the weekend checking it out and putting it through it's paces. So far so good. Xbox 360 and Netflix look great. Will follow up with a more complete review after the weekend.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------01/24/12Finally updating my review. What else can I say that hasn't been covered more in depth in other reviews? I'll just keep it short and sweet.I don't have a Bluray player, or surround sound, YET. I have basic cable which looks exactly like it should via the S-video connection. I hooked up the old bunny ear antenna I had laying around to get my local HD channels via the coax connection. As stated earlier Xbox games and Netflix, which make up 2/3 of the use of this TV, look great through HDMI connection.  I think the sound from the TV is really good. I do switch over to the antenna connection though when watching football as the picture from the over the air HD looks way better than watching with cable. I think the remote is really good, only took a day or two to get used to, the menus are simple and easy to navigate, and the options are plentiful enough.Anyone concerned about the  warranty, DOA, the hassle of a return, should not be, those issues have been explored in other customer reviews. I would have bought another one if I'd had a place to put it. You get exactly what you should in a TV at this price, and then some. Regardless of the initial DOA issue caused by, in my opinion, shipping damage, Amazon's ease of use, my virtually pain free return experience, and the quality of the TV, I AM ADJUSTING MY REVIEW TO A 5/5. I am WHOLLY satisfied with this TV.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "The GOOD, The BAD, The UGLY.", "Author": "joe@truevalue", "ReviewID": "R1MRTPTZSJFNNL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Good \"I purchase from AMAZON\"The Bad \"TCL 40 Inch Television\"The Ugly \"TCL Service Dept.\"TCL L40FHDF12TA 40-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LCD HDTV with 2-Year WarrantyLike everyone else I was sold by the positive reviews.

It really seemed almost too good to be true.  I just wish I had bought it a few days earlier when it was $299.99 during a sale on Amazon.  Ordered the TV on New Year's Eve and received it on 1/4/12...great delivery considering I took advantage of the Super Saver free shipping!  I read some reviews of DOA units and other problems.  Thus far (1 day) we have had no problems.  We bought this TV to use in our bedroom with a HD Dish Receiver.  It was very easy to hook up with the HDMI (3 are included) and has a picture that I would judge to be SUPERB!!  In fact, I was shocked at what a great picture it has.  Right now we are just using the TV for sound and it is very good for such an inexpensive set.  We have a surround sound system which I will probably hook up with this but, quite frankly, if all you are going to do is watch regular TV, the sound is fine.  I want the surround in case we were to watch a movie late at night or music channel.  We have another 65\" TV (different brand) in the Family Room for movies, etc with Surround Sound: so this is not a real big factor for us on this TV in the bedroom.  I did take advantage of some other folks notes to use the RCA codes for setting up the Dish Remote to operate the TV.  For me code 503 worked great.  The remote that comes with the TV is pretty basic but gets the job done fine.  But hey, for the $'s saved you can go buy a nice Harmony remote with all the whistles and buzzers and still have $'s left over versus buying more expensive name brand set.  Bottom line, this is a GREAT TV for the price; GREAT picture; Adequate Sound quality; easy to set up.  And Amazon is the GREATEST place to buy.  Great Price and Great Return policy.

The last model has over 1000 reviews and an overall rating of 4+ stars.  I went with this new model thinking newer is always better.  I was right, this new model is great, a black piano finish and a very clean, stylish, and minimal-style base made of plate glass.  Be advised there is no tilt option, but you can always shim the base to adjust for your needs, or wall-mount the unit.  It appears some \"internet-challenged\" have already placed reviews here for the older model by mistake.  This model only became available the FALL of 2011, my guess is October.I bought this for my sister's birthday, and only set it up tonight, but I am amazed with the quality.  Additionally, DirectTV had the remote codes, which was a huge negative with the previous model, with people upset that they could not set up the TV on an alternate remote.  TCL codes, not RCA codes.  Both probably work, but at least DTV is on the ball and providing codes for the latest equipment.  The model number was not exact, but the codes work 100%, all I did was select the 40\" model codes.Picture is great right out of the box, no adjustments at all.  All I did was select the \"home\" setting.  All colors, including flesh-tones, were perfect.  Sound right out of the TV, which usually sucks, was pretty good.  My sis has no home-theater system, but I may get her a sound bar to add some uummph.Anyway, at $380 delivered, for now, this is an amazing 40\" 1080p TV!!!  I wish I could swap my 40\" Toshiba for it!!!  This has a better pic than my 1080i Toshiba that I payed $600 for!!  This model is 1080i/1080p.Time will tell, and if I hit a bump in the road, I will update.  My advice is to go for it!!UPDATE:  Two years later, and now with 2 of these, they are still going strong.

Alas, after unpacking it, mounting the foot, installing everything, looking with pride new addition to my bedroom, I found out that antenna input does not work. So, it goes back for replacement; I hope (this time) second is the charm. Now, thumbs up for Amazon but what is wrong with TCL? Cheap product still suppose to work, but, based on product reviews and my personal experience this is a total lack of quality control on a product that does not appear to be manufactured on high standards.I am going for replacement, yet this time I keep my fingers crossed - returning a product is not a convenient process and I hate to go there.I'd like to add couple of words about my first general impressions on this TV for potential buyers, though. If the replacement set works right I plan on re-visiting this review. Overall design dates several years back - my wife dislikes aluminum line in front as a design element; matter of taste. I don't care for ultra thin TV set or frame around the screen; quality of picture is what counts. I didn't put it on a weight scale but my impression is that this TV set may be lighter than average 40\" set; I'd feel comfortable hanging it on a wall - not alone, though. Picture quality has few pre-sets and manual adjustment; blu-ray disk looked great on HDMI input after just a little bit of tweaking. Brightness is high for well illuminated environment - very positive; price is paid in electricity but this TV set is still not too hungry (according to energy rating label). Remote is very basic; it does the job but I'd like to have direct choice of input signal input on remote.Conclusion: Basic set well worth the price, under condition that you get one which works right out the box. Keep fingers crossed.UPDATE:After getting the replacement set and months later, this TV works. At the price asked now, this is far from being a bargain, though. Price aside, this TV can compete in picture quality with others. It appears that LCD/LED screen went up in price lately, but that not justifies difference in price what I paid for this set and asking price now. In short, for taking chances with this brand, one would expect a better deal.UPDATE Feb. 22 2013:I changed my rating from 1 star to 3. With Amazon return policy and 2 years warranty (I hope I won't have to test TCL tech support) this looks like a decent deal at today's 323. LED TV sets promise longer life and these would be my first choice now; price is what defines good deal.

I've used it to watch DVDs, use as a computer monitor, and played with a Wii.Pros:- Value, value, value. I originally paid $320 but got it adjusted to the latest $300 price after it dropped. That is just a great deal.- No dead pixels- Dead simple interface with simple menus where everything responds quickly. No menu lag, complicated options, internet gadgets, or indecipherable menu structures that I've seen on some very expensive \"Internet TVs.\" Input selection menu can be customized to be very short and annotated with the devices actually connected. Inputs switch quickly.- Surprising amount of video/picture adjustment options - and you can have separate settings for each input.- Looks like it costs more than it does. Great, sturdy, GLASS base. Clean, simple, and elegant design.- Great input selection for price range. 3x HDMI, 2x component, VGA, 2x composite video, even an S-video input, which are long gone on most TVs now.Cons:- Backlighting could be more even - mine is a little brighter in the upper right hand corner. Not noticeable unless you're staring at a completely black screen.- Relatively thick for an LCD, especially compared to newer LED TVs- Some motion blur is visible if you're using it for high contrast, high motion applications (e.g., as a computer monitor or in highly contrasted video games). I've only actually noticed blur when moving the (dark) Wii pointer on a totally white screen and in the scrolling scoreboards (which are dark gray scrolling against white) on Wii Fit. Not problematic or even noticeable in actual video game playing. No undesirable blur noticeable on movies or TV sources.- Average TV speakers. I have an older component system I use for sound.- Remote control has stiff buttons. This may improve with use.Have not evaluated:- Warranty. Complaints can be read here - hopefully they're isolated.- Over-the-air TV reception - I don't live in an area with great reception anyway and don't have an antenna to really do a proper evaluation. On the one channel I can get, it looks fine.If you're looking for a simple TV or monitor for DVD/game system/video streaming, it's hard to go wrong with this size, which will accommodate a lot of different room sizes.

In contrast, if you buy directly from Squaretrade, the warranty begins immediately on the TV's date of purchase.Here is the link to the Squaretrade warranty from Costco:[...]This is the fine print for the warranty from Costco:\"SquareTrade can also be bought to protect TVs bought outside of Costco, where 3 year added protection begins at end of manufacturer's warranty.*Excludes limited life consumables such as batteries and lamps.\"", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Extremely happy with TV; Nervous about warranty/Firmware update", "Author": "Whedon", "ReviewID": "R15EEBN2YAT36I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*************UPDATE 1/5/12*****************SW Version pre firmware update: V8-0RSC801-LF1V041SW Version post firmware update: V8-0RSC801-LF1V041After performing firmware update today the SW Version did not change (as listed in Menu>Setup>System Information)*************REVIEW 1/4/12*****************Before Christmas I woke up to an Amazon gold box deal for this TV for $260. My stomach tensed with excitement that I may be able to actually afford my first LCD TV. After an hour of model/brand research I clicked back to Amazon to purchase and it was sold out. Damn me and my lack of impulsiveness. On Christmas day, however, when this TV was back in stock and listed for $300 I decided not to pass on this again, even at $40 more, and ordered TV 12/25/11.TV arrived 12/28/11, setup was extremely easy: 4 screws in glass base, cable/sat channel scan (took about 8 minutes for scan), plug Xbox in via hdmi and cable in via coax and BOOM, up and running with my first HDTV. My jaw dropped when I tuned to the HD weather channel! Let me say again this is my first hdtv so I have no means of comparison but to a standard def Sanyo CRT, so I am no connoisseur, but 7 days later I am still in awe. Put in Enslaved Xbox 360 game and an audible \"Whoooa!\" was my first reaction to seeing a game in 1080p.Read the instruction manual cover to cover, tweaking settings as best I could, turning off the auto lighting and backlight functions, setting up a Personal picture setting to go along with the preset modes, adding 10 channels to the 'favorites' button on the remote. The remote is decent, but I do have a difficult time finding the circular +/- channel and +/- volume buttons in the dark as there are 2 circular buttons above the + volume + channel that, although slightly smaller, don't 'feel' much different. The 8-watt speakers work well for me as my living room is small and I'm only 11 feet from the TV. That said, I plan on buying Cyber Acoustics Subwoofer Satellite System (CA-3602) 2.1 speakers to connect to the R/L audio out next month to enhance sound.My current concern is 'to update firmware or not to update firmware?'. Right now I have not updated, although I did go ahead and put the update on a FAT formatted flash drive. Do I update and risk the TV going black as some have stated in these reviews and requiring a return to Amazon, or do I just leave well enough alone since I have no problems with the TV auto-powering on or changing volume? Other reviews indicate successful firmware update. I am so torn, but if i'm going to try it I need to do it within the 30 day return window. Gah! I will update with result if I get brave and try it.The scariest thing about this TV is the reviews i've read about the TLC customer service nightmares. I have decided that on day 29 of my Amazon purchase I will definitely be buying a 3 year warranty from Square Trade for peace of mind.Pros:-Best deal on hdtv I found-Beautiful HD picture-Tons of inputs including 3xHDMI-Input Skip to hide inputs you don't use, Channel Skip to hide unwanted channels (you heard me home shopping channels)-Setup menu is extremely easy to use-Glass stand is sturdy and attractive (subjective of course)-Silver strip accent goes well with my black and silver entertainment center (subjective)-I can walk almost all the way to the side of the Tv and still see the image clearly-Samsung LCD panel-remote makes it extremely easy to adjust aspect ratio and access 10 favorite channels and just feels good on button pressCons:-Firmware update hassle-No optical audio out-Possible sketchy TLC customer service/warranty-Subpar remote design on the +/- channel & volume in my opinion (still make mistakes with those in the dark d/t similar feeling buttons above)-SD channels look very 'blah'-Light bleed in top left/right corners when screen is solid black; NOT noticeable at all when image on screen-I have to switch between picture settings (Eco/Sports/Cinematic/Vibrant/Natural/Personal) often for tv shows/sports/movies/xbox games. Being that this is my first hdtv maybe this is normal, although I still haven't found a great setting for very dark movies after trying to adjust Personal picture mode for this purpose.-With my PS2 plugged in via RCA, each time I make a selection on a DVD (play, skip forward, etc) there is an annoying 'pop' sound from the speakers. This does not occur on xbox via hdmi.-If you turn off an input and take too long to decide what you want to do/watch next, the TV will power off after a few minutes (it does warn you first). This could just as easily go in the Pro's category for some.TLDR: Love the TV, love the price, nervous about TLC warranty/customer svc, nervous about doing firmware update.

Most of those televisions cost twice (or more) what this one does.  This is a good set, and a great set for the price, but not the best television ever made.First, the picture.  That is, after all, why we buy a high definition set.If you exclusively watch fast-motion video, you might want to look for one of the 240 Hz (or faster) sets, but you'll pay more than twice the price for a smaller screen.  If you are putting together a home cinema room you'll want to go to a larger set, 60\" or larger.  But expect to pay triple the price of this set.

There is a headphone jack on the side, along with another HDMI input, another composite video input (for video cameras) and a USB 2.0 input (for all sorts of stuff), but the headphone jack cuts off the speakers, and there's no way to override.Yes, that's picking at some really small nits.This set won't give you bragging rights with your buddies and isn't cutting edge.  It's just a really good set for a really good price.A couple more notes:1.  Yes, some folks have gotten broken televisions.  Not surprisingly, inexpensive televisions are occasionally dead on arrival,  Of course, expensive televisions are occasionally dead on arrival too.  Keep the box until you're sure it works, and don't arrange for delivery on the day of the big event you want to watch.  Test the set as soon as you get it.

But we're very pleased with the performance of the TCL.  It does everything it is supposed to do, and does so without too much complexity.  The different aspect ratios, luminance levels, inputs and other basic settings one often seems to need are just one button away.  And the unit has more inputs, and outputs, than most owners would probably need.  It even has SVHS if one still has a SVHS equipped VCR or cable-box.The picture quality is fantastic, and while playing the latest PS3 games we saw no blurring even though this is a 60Hz only set.  The colors and contrast are just as good as any other set I've seen, although as with all TVs, I'm sure one could find differences with side-by-side comparisons.Not being a field LED set than can vary individual LED's brightness, there is some slight bleed at the corners (when the screen area is total black) as one would see with many edge LED and other CCFL based sets. But this isn't really a problem or no greater than others in this class, or even more expensive edge LED sets.  I would in no way count this against the set.The set itself seems well built and looks every bit as classy as more expensive sets.  And the heavy glass stand is a real plus.  The packing, and unpacking process, was well thought out and our TV arrived unscathed.  In no way does the set look cheap.The remote control is a shiny lacquer look that some may or may not like, but I think was done well and looks good.  It doesn't have a plethora of buttons, but seems to have the most used features one click away.  The remote seems to work well and doesn't feel cheap.

I was nervous about the  brand, TCL, but the thousand or so positive reviews on the TV convinced me to give it a try, and I was very happy.  TCL makes an easy-to-use, no-frills, affordable HDTV with a nice picture that was a startling improvement over my ancient tube TV.When I was given the opportunity to review the \"TCL L40FHDF12TA 40-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LCD HDTV\" I was excited.  Surely, when it comes to television technology, newer is always better, right?  Not necessarily.Right out of the box, I was disappointed in the look of the 12TA.  Whereas the 11TA had a sleek, futuristic look, this 12TA can only be described as industrial.  Instead of a sculpted black base that matches the set, the foot for the 12TA is just a glass plate mounted with four screws.  It sets up easy enough, but it just doesn't look as good.  Then, there is a large strip of metal going across the front on the bottom of the TV on the 12TA that wasn't there on the 11TA.  I don't know why these design-elements were changed, but the 12TA is not as handsome a TV as the 11TA.The rears of the TVs are identical.  Both the 11TA  and the 12TA have the exact same number of interfaces.  The remote for the 12TA is larger and I found it to be inconvenient, but maybe that is because I am used to the remote for the 11TA.But we aren't buying TVs to be decorations, right?  So how is the performance?The 12TA claims to have \"enhanced picture and sound.\"  I set the two TVs next to each other and gave them a watch. I don't have a BluRay player, but I do have an upscalling DVD player and both TVs registered as native 1080p.  They have identical options  as far as picture adjustment goes.  I normally turn off the Backlight Sensor, because it doesn't work very well and leaves the screen too dark.  In terms of advancement, the 12TA doesn't have any extra features over the 11TA.  I did find that the 12TA had a slightly nicer picture.  I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, and it wasn't an incredible difference, but there was definitely more going on with the 12TA than the 11TASo I give them the \"enhanced picture.\"  Enhanced sound, on the other hand ... there really wasn't any difference.  Neither TV has nice sound; the speakers are just regular TV speakers, and they just aren't going to give you a full sound experience.  I have a surround-sound system, so I almost never use the TV speakers anyways.My real problem with the 12A came with its internal antenna.  At our house we don't have cable or satellite TV, but there are a few free, local digital channels that we enjoy watching.  For some reason, the 11TA can watch them while the 12TA cannot.  It was strange to see.  With the two TVs sitting right next to each other, my wife and I initiated the channel search on both TVs at the same time, and while the 11TA picked up and showed the local channels, the 12TA claimed it couldn't find anything.  Even when you tried to program those channels directly in, it wouldn't display them.Ultimately, the channel issues and the industrial design of the TV meant that we decided to keep the 11TA in the main room and relegate the newer, 12TA to a bedroom.  Even though the picture is slightly better, the fact that it can't locate local channels and--too be perfectly honest--just doesn't look cool meant that the negatives outweighed the single positive.If you are looking for an affordable flat-panel HDTV, then the TLC brand is a great way to go.

So I did research.  There is a reason that this is the #1 selling TV on Amazon.com.  First, one of the user photos shows that the panel is made by Samsung.  In my research I found that TCL is the parent company of RCA.  TCL is the branding they used on other continents while using RCA in the US.  I guess the TCL brand has come to America now.  Also, TCL were contracted by Samsung to produce some of Samsung's LCD panels, thus the Samsung panel in this TV.PROS: You can't beat the price.  The HD picture quality is good.  The sound is actually better than some other budget HDTVs.  In my case, I usually hook up a set of $30 powered computer speakers with a sub to my TVs.  So far I have not found the need to use them with this TV.  As many have mentioned, the base is sturdy and made of glass, not that that's a huge deal.  Plenty of connections and settings to tweak the picture and sound quality to your preference.

I went from a tube tv in the bedroom (tube tv's having no input lag whatsoever just straight monitor) to this, and it's practically identical feeling only it's 1080p and it looks great! The game I tested it on is Modern Warfare 3 on my PS3 (the ultimate lag testing game-I can't think of anything faster paced) and I tested it with Halo Reach on my Xbox 360 when I first got it this afternoon to make sure it worked and it did great on that too. There was another review that mentioned he had tested it on a couple games and it didn't seem to have input lag, but he didn't mention WHAT games so I was still unsure as you wouldn't really notice as sharply on most games. I took a chance and I am here to tell you that I felt in control and no lag the whole time- super pleased! Got straight on here to let you guys know because I saw a few people asking about it in the comments on other reviews and its a major concern especially if that's the bulk of what you're going to be doing with it:)I've had the input lag problem with several tv's including my Toshiba 46\" 1080P 240hz in the living room that doesn't feel right totally. It even has game mode which basically cancels extra processing and speeds up the image response like .33hz or something to combat input lag. I believe the fact that this TCL TV is 60hz is a contributing factor to it's lack of input lag. No overprocessing which you don't need with a good hdmi signal from the source anyway, just a good solid 1080p responsive picture. Don't get me wrong, this tv has bells and whistles too, but I think the Toshibas problem (only concerning input lag) is the 240hz and the other processing it does to put out an amazing picture- takes more time to think. When I pan my character's view around in a game it's very hard to stop where I want to consistantly. It even feels like it speeds up as you swing around (like the processor's catching up which is typical of tvs with input lag) making it almost impossible to zero in on a specific spot or opponent accurately at least before they get you:) It does totally fine on most games, but split second timing reflexive games I really notice it.For those of you that don't know what input lag is, it's a processing delay in displaying the image from the source (when you move it should move steadily and consistantly) that is really only noticeable when gaming (or using the tv as a monitor for your computer-you'll find controlling your mouse much more difficult etc...) because you are actually controlling the image and know when you told it to do what. It doesn't affect viewing movies or anything of that nature because it could have a 5 SECOND delay on when it displays the movie and we'd never know it. It's only a matter of milliseconds, but completely changes the feel of controlling your character especially in fast paced precision movement type games. The image you see is not accurately reporting what you're hands are telling it to do and it makes it very difficult to play (or at least a very akward and sluggish feeling).On the other aspects: this tv is very vibrant with good color contrast, viewing angles seem to be great, I'm not noticing a bunch of motion blur, and it's a very similar looking picture to my much more expensive tv. I've been looking for a bdrm tv for a while waiting for a good deal and this is BY FAR the best deal I've seen. I would've been happy with 720p at this price. I didn't want to spend too much and was origionally looking at 32\" 720p tv's that were around $300, so when this popped up on the screen with 4 1/2 stars from so many customers I was definately interested and started reading reviews.There seems to be a common problem with this TV showing up DOA or with other malfunctions that definately made me nervous. It had me thinking maybe the components inside aren't secured well enough and/or breaking from shipping jostling or some other OEM defect so even if it arrives fine, it could quit working after moving or something. After looking at it though, and putting it thru some initial paces and comparing to the pic on my other tv, I don't think that this will happen. It seems like a pretty solid unit. It could have been a bad batch or being thrown around by the delivery people or anything really, though it doesnt instill a lot of confidence. After seeing it and having all of my requirements completely met and surpassed, I would say that if you get a bad one take advantage of Amazon's awesome return policy and have 'em send you another because I believe you won't be disappointed. If something goes wrong down the road there's a 2 year warranty so there's not much to worry about (although some are saying the OEM's customer service isn't great)- you'll still be able to get it taken care of eventually. A warranty's a warranty. Just come back and tell people what happened on here- that seems to get their attention as one review I read seemed to infer.I just got it this afternoon so I'll update if anything of note happens, but as it stands you can't beat the price and the quality seems to be there too! Great product so far, and an unbeatable price on a 40\" 1080p tv!UPDATE 2/2/2012: It's been a week, absolutely no problems, good solid operation. I popped back on to say that I too checked the back of the display panel through the vent holes and it DOES say SAMSUNG on it which doesn't suprise me considering the great picture. I notice motion blur a little watching streaming vids now, but you have to be looking for it and it's to be expected with a 60hz refresh rate. Don't notice it gaming though. Still a great product for the money. Oh, and the buttons on the remote stick for a sec after being pushed...kinda weird but it's gotten better already.UPDATE 4/21/2012: Still going strong after 3 months! I havent noticed it lately, but I did notice it making ticking noises as it cooled down after shutting it off.  It sounded like a baseboard heater popping and cracking (not near as loud but you get the idea). I don't think it's done that for a month or so now. It was probably just \"settling in\" but I was a little concerned about that for a while.  Overall the picture is still great- it's darker overall than my other one- not as much contrast in the blacks but that's to be expected. Hey, it's a $300 tv, but at least it has a Samsung screen!  Gaming is still as good as ever- perfect control.UPDATE 9/19/2012:  I love this tv.  It's still doing just fine and I tend to watch more of this one than my living room tv so LOTS of hours on it now.  It's still got the ticking sometimes for a bit when I turn it off as it cools down, but it's still great other than that. I noticed the price went up $100 tho since I purchased it which puts it in competition with some other decent brands- not the smokin deal that it was.  I can say that I've had a good experience with it tho and the warranty's pretty cool so best of luck with your tv hunting:)AMMENDMENT: I just saw that there is another prime option for this tv that is $360 so that's only $30 more than I paid and is still well worth it:)", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture, easy setup and plenty of inputs", "Author": "Jennifer Ray", "ReviewID": "R1L6X67BTREGG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been waiting to upgrade to an HD television for a number of reasons, chief of which was I wanted to wait until the prices came down a bit. After watching the prices more closely in the last year, I decided the time was right to upgrade.When I saw the TCL L40FHDF12TA 40-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LCD HDTV offered as a Deal of the Day at Amazon, I was torn. I'd never heard of the TCL brand before, and I couldn't envision how big a 40-inch LCD TV was. While I deliberated over the decision, the deal sold out within just a few hours. Determined to not miss the next opportunity, I researched the TCL brand. When I learned that Samsung has outsourced production of some of their LCD TVs to TCL and that TCL also makes the RCA TVs in North America, I was sold.A couple of days later, the same television was back in stock, and again on sale for a fantastic price. So I bought it.It arrived in just a couple of days in very good condition. I started setting it up as soon as I arrived home from work. The hardest part of the whole set up was lifting my heavy old standard definition television off the entertainment center. In comparison, the TCL L40FHDF12TA was extremely light.It does require some quick assembly - you simply need to screw the base onto the television, which was very easy. After that, it was just a matter of plugging everything in, which is a no-brainer. I plugged my Roku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player and my TiVo TCD746320 Premiere DVR, Black into two of the HDMI ports and my DVD player into the composite input. All devices look fantastic on this television.The TCL L40FHDF12TA sports a decent amount of inputs: three HDMI, two composite, one component video, one RF, one PC video, one PC audio, and a USB 2.0 port.The remote control is logically laid out and very easy to use. I was able to quickly learn the most often used controls by touch.The audio on this television is very good. I'll eventually add surround sound to it, but for now the built-in speakers work perfectly well for me.As for the picture, the colors are beautiful, the picture is crisp and everything I've watched looks beautiful, no matter which device I've used.I want to upgrade the television in my bedroom to HD soon, and the TCL brand is definitely at the top of my list of considerations when I buy another television.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than expected, TCL is great.

There are no bells and whistles with this set and that's just fine if you intend to use this as a bedroom set like me.  Delivery only took a few days and I paid zero shipping costs. The packaging was standard. Everythingwas intact and  functioning.Attaching the glass base took only minutes. Connecting all the wires took even less.  There are plenty of ways to connect this television to almost any component, including 3 HDMI ports.  I was a little confused by the numbering of the HDMI ports. It seema the 2 port should be where the 3 port is. Set up was a breeze.  Remember, you will need an HDTV cable box.The picture quality rivals that of the 50 inch Panasonic plasma that I bought almost one year earlier.  The contrast on the TCL is superior to the plasma but the color crown belongs to the older set. Definition and detail are pretty even.  The sound on this TCL is adequate. It's loud but doesn't have a lot of depth. Again, for a bedroom set, this is just fine.We will see how this television lasts through the weeks and months.  All things considered (price, set up, quality) I'm very pleased with this purchase.**UPDATE**Two months later and the television its still going strong.  There were a few instances where the screen turned to snow for about one second.  However, I can't rule out the possibility that it was caused by my cable signal and not the television itself.  I also find that the volume button stocks on my cable remote from time to time.  But again, it may be the fault of the cable remote and not the television.All things considered, this purchase was a steal.***UPDATE***After one year of use this television is as good as day one.  There was a period of time about 9 months in where the picture would turn to snow about 2 or 3 times a day.  It would last about 30 seconds to one minute.  This issue occurred for about 1 month then went away as suddenly as it started.  Other than that weird occurrence, I can honestly say that the television has performed beautifully.

Does it handle fast action, like football, spot on with no distortion? No--its an LCD, so that is to be expected.  But does it handle it outstandingly for the price I paid?  You bet.________________________I had initially decided to wait another year to buy my first HDTV to replace a conventional 32-inch Sanyo bulb set (which stills works fine, I was just ready to move up to flat screen HDTV).  I had even settled in on getting a plasma, probably an LG.  Then I saw this 40-inch TCL on sale as a special Holiday Deal ($259).  I was impressed by the features and the low price.  I ordered it that Thursday morning.  There is still a warm place in my heart for a good plasma, but the price here swayed me.Amazon shipped it so fast that they tried to deliver it two days later on a Saturday.  And that was the free shipping method!The TV came out of the box in good order.  Installation was pretty easy, as I am just using the stand.  And the base is a thick piece of glass, so very nice touch there.I have seen some well written reviews here advising of defective units out of the box, and some reviews from people who, well, let's be honest here, did not sound like they could turn on a toaster without some assistance.  Defective units do happen--read reviews on any product, especially TV's, and you will see more than a couple of valid cases.  I had my concerns.  But, I've had it hooked up for two days now, and have to say I am truly amazed at the picture quality for the price of the unit.  After tweaking the picture settings I can say that I have not seen as good as an image on some more expensive, non-LCD sets.  I really have to wonder if owners of the name brand LED sets don't bother to adjust the factory settings much.  Now, I am aware that if you put this TV next to a good Sony that you would be able to see the difference in picture quality.  But it won't set you back the $ that a good Sony LED or even LCD will.On the sound quality, with just about any flat screen TV, don't expect much out of the speakers.  You should plan on having a surround sound system or home stereo hooked up to the unit, or else the beauty of 40-inch HDTV will be marred by flat sound (though it does have an equalizer that can & should be adjusted to make the most out of the on-board speakers).So, after a few days of use, I am floored by the quality relative to the low price of the unit.  And I am comforted by Amazon's 30 day TV return shipping policy and also by TCL's Two Year warranty.

But I just bought an LG Infinia 60PZ750 60-Inch 1080p 600 Hz Active 3D THX Certified Plasma HDTV, so I do have something to compare as a performance reference (the LG being a rather well reviewed plasma TV).The picture is bright, contrast is good, viewing angle seems very good for an LCD. I am using it in our bedroom, so 40 inch is an appropriate size given the space. I agree with some that the styling is not quite state of the art (which is subjective, granted), but it's subdued enough and not really noticeable when you're actually watching TV (as opposed to staring at the powered off set). It has no real \"Internet\" features - but it's connected to my LG BD570 Bluray player that offers plenty of that, so I wasn't concerned. It's very nice to have those, but there is more than one way to skin a cat, so to speak.Thanks to another reviewer, I was even able to easily program my Comcast remote to control it (it was the first code he listed - 11447) and I can control volume, power, even the sleep timer(!) - all the necessities for a bedroom TV.It seems very light, but I imagine that's just compared to the 60\" plasma I just unboxed a month ago. Packaging was really very sturdy, with nice braces to frame the box, and unboxing it and attaching the stand (which only mounts one way, a nice touch, with just 4 sturdy screws) was no issue at all for just one person. It seems well balanced and very steady on the stand.Hey, I can't comment on the durability - I just got it. My experience with these panels is strictly from my life as a software engineer, which I seem to notice they usually fail out of the box or shortly afterwards and then last far longer than my desire to keep it. So far I'm pleased with the performance, and VERY pleased with the price ($260). I'm sure people who bought Vizio's and LG's years ago were hesitant, too. A little research indicated that TCL is the world's 6th largest panel manufacturer, and OEM'd some other (granted, less desirable) brands like RCA.

I was watching TV in the afternoon when it just decided to shut off. Tried to turn it back on with no luck, plugged it into three other outlets and did a hard reset to no avail. Onto the customer service, I called on July 6th only to be greeted by a woman who was speaking very broken English. After 15 minutes of information trading, she tells me that this was the wrong number to call and that I would need to call another number. So, dialed the new number to be yet again, greeted by a woman who I could barely understand. After wasting another 15 minutes for info trading, I'm told that it would be 7-10 days before I would receive the parts needed for the repair, and on top of that, it would be another 2-3 days for a technician to come out and fix it. Then I'm asked to email my proof of purchase to them, because apparently the serial number and all personal information isn't enough, so I sent that through email not 2 minutes after I got off the phone. So at this point I am very cross towards this company, but at least it'll be fixed soon...right? WRONG. A week goes by with no parts, but an email. An email that thanks me for sending in the proof of purchase and asks me to provide the issues I am having along with the serial number. So I call back to see what is going on...Now, I'm told that my information nor the order for the parts are even in the system, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So once again I have to give my information, give the serial number, explain the issues, and email the proof of purchase. I was told that it would be at least 2 business days to get the order processed, then up to 7 business days to get it shipped, and then another 2-3 for the technician to come out and fix it. So by the end of all of this, 1/4 of the time I have had this TV will be in a broken state. NEVER again will I even consider this company for any product.

My normal dvd player worked great with the tv.The PROBLEM I had was with my PlayStation Three.  I plugged it in and used the \"hold the button\" method to reset the output.  The PS3 located the TV's HDMI 1080p just fine.  But on the screen it was \"snowy\" dots all over the screen, and the sound did not work very well at all.  I switched the PS3 to 720p and it worked just fine, lower quality, but worked just fine.  The problem was not with the PS3 because I have been using it with other flat screens successfully.  So I decided to test the 1080p with a 1080p player.  Plugged it in and it had the same problem.  I did some research and sometimes slim PS3s don't work on every TV, so I do not know for sure that the TV was having a problem.

The box was falling apart at the bottom and I had to help the FedEx guy bring in the box.  The package arrived a day later than Amazon had predicted.Tv Looks:  5 StarsIt's a good looking TV.  It's thicker than you would expect.  The base of the stand is made of glass, but is sturdy.  Attaching the base seems a little off.  You have to screw in the 4 screws up through the bottom of the stand.  The screws themselves seem Janky and out of place, but are not visible once set up and seem to attach the base well.  The shiny black plastic around the TV looks nice in contrast with the silver lining the bottom of the TV.  The black tempered glass bass fits well and is plenty large enough to hold the TV firmly.TV Picture:  5 Stars (For the price)It's a pretty good picture with the help of calibrating from those that have reviewed this TV before.  It's 60Hz which you will notice with sports and movies but the overall 1080p does look a lot better than 720p.  DVD's look good (The Dark Night), cable looks like cable should, and the Wii looks just like the product it is.  Netflix looks better on this TV for some reason.  The darks are just dark enough.TV Set up:  4 StarsPlenty of quality inputs make it a breeze to get up and running.  The base is pretty easy to install.  Calibrating is easy thanks to the lack of options that a higher end TV would offer.  The actual TV setup process is quick and easy.  The base screws (silver and cheap) should be black and strong to match the TV's aesthetics, and a few more options for the TV picture calibration would have been nice.  Maybe a \"gaming\" option for screen picture would have been nice, but \"Cinematic\" looks fineTV Sound: 4 StarsThe TV for a flat screen actually doesn't sound as bad as I expected.  The speakers are downward firing and though they lack bass, they sound clear and get loud enough.  The thickness of the TV probably allows for bigger speakers.  Compared to other flat screens, it sounds as good as the others, but not great.  Get a surround sound....Overall I'm very happy for the money.  It looks and sounds better than what you would expect from a 40\" LCD Tv for the price.  I highly recommend.This is comparing it to:LG Scarlet 42\"Sony 40\"LG Plasma 50\"That we use in the house.

Reviews here are all either love or hate on this item, which left me a little worried when I made my purchase. I took the plunge as the price is unparalleled anywhere and it is from Amazon's fulfillment center. I know first hand how great Amazon is for returns. I felt absolutely confident that if I got the lemon, a return would be hassle free. And from the reviews it kind of seems to be a crap shoot whether you get the functional or non functional one. When they work no one has any complaints, so I crossed my fingers and waited for it to arrive.The FedEx driver asked me to come out to the van and decide if I wanted to accept the delivery a the package was damaged which worried me. Damage seemed superficial to package and trusting Amazon's excellent customer service I accepted package. And luckily mine is perfectly functional. This experience, however, leads me to think MANY of the issues with this TV that have been reported on reviews, may very well stem from FedEx employee's heavy handed treatment of TV when they unload it from planes and load it onto trucks, etc. But who knows on that score.I only have two issues on this tv. I have purchased two antenna's for it and have been unable to receive ANY reception. I previously had a computer monitor hooked up to my Roku and Bluray, so I never watched broadcast television. Since this is an actual TV I figured I'd go ahead and check out broadcast television after a many year hiatus, but mine will not receive reception. I live in a city and can find no reason why two separate antenna's would fail to function. But as I am already accustomed to life without broadcast TV, I don't find it an adequate reason for the fuss of an exchange. But I do find it an adequate reason to give it 4 stars instead of five.My second complaint is that some older DVD's look appalling on this screen. So pixelated and grainy, it seems lower quality than a VHS tape. I tried these DVD's in both blu-ray and Xbox and reduced image to 480, which did not help. Though this is not necessarily a fault of the television, it is worth noting that upgrading your hardware may also necessitate upgrading your software. Otherwise my bluray discs and my Xbox games look FANTASTIC. Gaming is significantly improved with clarity of image and large size of screen.Good luck on your purchase!

(for it's screen size)- Quality a lot better than expected!- EASY setup (Took no more than 10 minutes to set up, plug in, scan, and watch [see review under for more details).- Energy Saver! (Estimated yearly savings is a lot lower on this TV than many others [or so they claim).- 3 HDMI ports, one on the side (HDMI port 2), a USB port on the side, and many other plug ports in the back.- GLASS stand instead of plastic (as people have stated the past model of this TV had either a plastic or metal stand).Cons:- Wider than most flat screen TVs; about 1 and 6/8 inches wide (excluding the rounding part on the very back), considerably, but no overwhelmingly, wider than most.*- Will update if anything wrong comes up with the TV; along with the time frame of when it happened / how far from the purchasing point.Highly Recommend this product for those of you in need of a cheap, yet decent (if not, good/great) TV, with 3 HDMI ports. I will update if anything wrong comes up. More details in the review under this.So I was a little skeptical about purchasing this TV initially after reading a lot of reviews about negative aspects (such as the TV not turning on at all, blanking out, horrid customer service, etc.). Despite this, (as the same as a lot of the products I purchase from Amazon), I figured that with the price (I bought it at $300) for a 40\" being very reasonable, I thought that I'd go ahead and try this TV out; and boy was that a great choice.The TV was supposed to arrive on the 29th, but it arrived on the 28th (props to Amazon for the speedy shipment; Amazon Prime), so that was a plus. When I opened the box, I was pretty surprised to see that the TV was a little wider than I had expected; the TV was about 1 and 6/8th (approximately) inches wide, excluding the rounding back area, which is considerably wider than most LCD's nowadays. Ex; My Samsung 46\" is a lot thinner, nearly half as thin as this. Despite this, I was not too disappointed about the width. As for the set up:The setup was relatively fast, and easy. To set it up, you simply had to take the TV out, place it on a carpet (or the flattened box) upside-down, place the glass stand in it's place, and screw it in. Yes, Glass stand which is a lot better than the plastic ones I've heard the past TCL televisions obtained. Screwing in the glass stand took no more than 2 minutes, and my TV was in place within minutes.Another plus about this television is that, compared with a lot of other Televisions that are 40-46\" + 1080p, this TV has 3 HDMI ports (from my knowledge [considering the price as well], most have 2 HDMI ports), including one on the side with a USB port included. Plugging in my cable box was also quick and easy, as it took less than 1 minute to simply screw it in. Now for when the TV was turned on;After turning the TV on, I was prompted to pick a few settings. The TV channel surfing was rather quick to my pleasure (I'd say about 3 minutes or so), and my TV was ready to watch in 4-5 minutes (Grand total of 10 minutes or less to Set up and watch my TV). Initially, I was disappointed with the picture quality, but after browsing through the TV settings, I noticed that the Television was in ECO mode for picture, and after switching to Vibrant, the quality was fantastic! The sound was also clear, I had no problems and had no need to update firmware as past reviewers have stated doing so.As the final test, I plugged in my PS3, and for the first time, used the HDMI cable to get the best quality I could get. Simply plugged everything in, plugged in the HDMI cable, switched to HDMI 2 (which is the HDMI port on the side of the TV), and my PS3 was ready instantly. Overall this TV is great, so far I have had no problems with it, and I highly recommend this TV for those of you with a budget, yet are in need of a decent, if not good, TV.

Know your hook ups and know what you are looking for. This TV is a great buy at $303.98 shipped to my door.2 weeks later... TV on about 5 hours a day with no problems. The only problem I see is I have my input to HDMI1 and if the TV is off for a long time, I have to select that input before I see a picture. I think it should remember your last setting and keep it.

I was a little nervous, but felt like I couldn't go wrong with Amazon's return policy. I just received it, and so far am very pleased.Pros: You really can get a good picture working with the settings. There are moments that you can tell it isn't pristine, but the picture is as good as any tv close to this price range that you would see hanging on the wall in a big box store. The design is fairly low profile and modern, and the remote is fine. Obviously the price for the size is a plus.Cons: The sound is pretty poor in my opinion. Before using the EQ it's awful, so thank goodness that setting is available. After the custom EQ it is bearable, but I have some bookshelf speakers hooked up that I will probably use 99% of the time. And again, there are moments when things look a little washed out...I'm not an expert but it seems like when there is a brighter background you lose a little definition.Overall, don't be scared to buy the tv.

So if you order one of these and it fails within the Amazon return period, all you have to do is take it apart, repackage it, and send it back to Amazon, who will have UPS pick it up.

It was an incredible deal -- too good to pass up.However, I think for people who are considering buying this TV, my advice to you is to temper your expectations.Sure, this is a nice, simple TV -- easy to set up, easy to install, fairly lightweight, and looks decent enough.  BUT, it's not a Samsung or a name brand and that means you should not try to compare it's features to that of a $1000+ LCD TV.Seriously folks, those of you comparing this TCL 40\" with a Samsung 40\" are out of your minds.  This is a $259.99 TV!  What you get for this price is GREAT.  It's a 1080p, 40\", new (not a refurb), and has a 2-year warranty.  I can't comment on the warranty part but most TV's come with only a 1-year warranty.The picture is great but there is some motion blur when there is a lot of movement on the screen.  Also, you'll have to adjust the settings quite a bit.  They have several pre-set modes such as Sports, Cinematic, Natural, ECO, etc.  However, depending on what channel you're watching, it's a bit of a pain to keep switching picture modes.For example, if I'm watching an NBA game, the \"Sports\" mode is clearly better and more clear to watch than let's say -- the cinematic mode.  And if you're watching a movie on Cable, you probably want to use the Cinematic mode rather than the Sports mode because it'll be easier on your eyes.  It's definitely a bit of a pain to keep having to switch.  As far as I can tell, there's no \"one-mode-fits-all\" type of settings for the picture settings.  I believe this is one of the weaknesses of the TV and the reason why the TV manufacturer TCL decided to pre-set the different picture modes in the first place.  It's a good effort to mitigate the issue but still a bit annoying nonetheless.In any case, the bottom line is -- this is a $259.99 TV.  For that kind of price, you're getting a steal.  There are weaknesses such as lack of a one-size-fits-all picture setting, some motion blurs and the sound is average (at best) when compared to a premium TV like a mid-high end Samsung, but for the price, it's a terrific TV that I would highly recommend if you're looking for a bargain.Hope this helps some of you folks.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hauled this baby across the country and it's running fine.", "Author": "J.Steve", "ReviewID": "R3JXA5I3ZJYSAF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV about 2 years ago and it's the best TV I ever bought.

Really just no complaints about this TV whatsoever.

Now here it is 4 months later, and I am still very happy with this TV.I have not attempted to contact warranty support, so I cannot comment on that issue. I hope they will be helpful if I do need to contact them, but I made my purchase with the knowledge that I may not actually have a real warranty.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy with TV", "Author": "Becalyn", "ReviewID": "R10IHWCT4WAE4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased for $329 Jan 2012 with free shipping.  I read multiple Amazon reviews of this product (even the bad DOA ones) and decided to purchase even though I'd never heard of this brand before, mainly because of the 2-yr warranty and the customer service described by others when they needed to use the warranty.SHIPPINGTV arrived ultra-promptly.  Purchased late night on a Wed, arrived via FedEx Fri.  I wasn't expecting it so soon, I had free super-saver shipping and wasn't expecting it for 1-2 weeks as I live in the mid-west.PACKAGINGI was concerned about purchasing such a large TV over the internet and having it shipped but the TV was well-secured and heavy-duty-cardboard boxed.  Nothing was broken or scratched.  2 large yellow thick-plastic-type straps were secured around the box which made it easier to carry.  The straps didn't dent the cardboard much which showed how solid the cardboard was.ASSEMBLYOnly thing needing to be assembled was putting the glass stand on the TV.  Took just a couple minutes with the screws that came with it.  It's nicely-sized and thicker glass so it worked well.  I ended up mounting it on the wall so took the stand off ultimately.OPERATIONI like this TV.  I'm not a big electronics guru that has to have the latest stuff so the easy plug n play feature was great for me:  movies on DVD, antenna cord hookup, Atari Flashback, and headphones are all I needed to plug in.  I like the various input/output options too...you can hookup on the side or in the back of the TV (as shown by the Amazon.com pictures).The visual and audio are great.  I sit about 12-15 feet from the TV and I get a clear picture and sound.  I can change the picture mode based on what I'm watching (natural, sports, eco, vibrant, etc).  I really like changing the screen from full-screen to normal to zoom to expand; it feels like I'm in a movie theater watching movies when I pop a DVD in.  Only thing I don't like about that...putting DVD subtitles on when it's in full-screen/cinematic view.  The subtitles appear below what appears on the viewable TV screen so you can't see them to read them.  Odd quirk, not a big deal though.  Just switch back to 'normal' view and you can see the subtitles appear.REMOTE CONTROLThis control is easy-breezy to use.  Keys do not stick and it works from 30 feet away, don't need to point directly at the TV either.Happy with this TV.

I've played multiple FPS games on it (MW3, Halo Reach, BF3) and all have looked beautifully.This TV owns cinematics as well, such as the ones in Final Fantasy 13-2. Just comes to life, especially in the dark! That being said, you may want to toy with your settings to get the look you desire ( I had to do this ) The Wii looks very good too, so long as you hook up with the component cables.Blu-Ray / HD TelevisionExceptional quality for both spectrums. I stream netflix and Hulu Plus in HD and the results are fantastic. I still cannot believe the bargain I got on this TV.Sound:The sound is a bit left to be desired. Sometimes the volume seems to go up and down. It might just be me. I suggest toying with your sound settings before you do much viewing.

Can't believe it took so long to find this TV. 300+ reviewers and 4.5 stars is a rare and beautiful thing to find on Amazon, and this won't let you down.Don't be put off by the relatively unknown brand name (in fact, TCL Corp is globally the sixth-largest TV manufacturer - known in the Americas as RCA - and Samsung even outsources some of its TV production to TCL) or the suspiciously low price (I paid $320; I know it has at times dropped to below $300 but that's still a fantastic deal for a 40\" LCD).Some reviewers have mentioned that the item's packing arrived battered and torn up from shipping. My box was spotless, but regardless the TV was packaged so well that I'm sure the box could take a beating without affecting the TV at all. There was lot of compressed Styrofoam and reinforced cardboard to protect the device.Installing the stand took about five minutes. The stand itself is very impressive, made of glass with black glossy paint covering the top and bottom, save for a stylish thin clear glass border running along the sides. I love this look, but it should be noted that the stand in the picture looks like it's silver. Mine was black. The stand screws in flawlessly and sturdily using four provided screws, so be sure you have a Phillips screwdriver.The TV itself looks great, with a glossy black border and a soft blue light in the bottom-left that illuminates when the TV is on. This is fantastic for me; Samsung, LG, and other big manufacturers have a habit of putting their giant illuminated logo right beneath the screen or something annoying like that. If you prefer not to have the logo shining in your face while you're trying to watch something, this is a great plus.Connecting the device was a breeze, thanks to the numerous ports on the side for easy access (there are also connectors on the back for your more permanent fixtures). I lost count of the number of HDMI and RCA inputs, but it all felt very solid (some TV backings seem to cave a bit as you apply pressure to insert a cable). I did feel that the power cord could be longer; I don't know exactly how short it was (maybe it's in the product specifications), but consider buying an extension cord or longer power cord if you'll be placing the TV more than 4-6 feet from a power source.Once turned on, you might need to toy with the screen to get it to look as bright and vibrant as you want. There's a great review in here (currently it's rated as the most-useful, so hopefully ou can find it there) that provides some good guidance on what might work for you, but keep in mind it all depends on factors such as other light sources in your room, proximity to windows, etc. I've had my TV for four days and still occasionally play with the color settings, depending on what I'm watching. It's a little finicky, but I'm sure I'll settle on something soon enough, and it's better to have more control than less. But the screen is crisp and bright, especially when I'm hooked up to my computer via HDMI in full 1080p high-definition glory. Changing inputs (I'm regularly bouncing between HDMI input and standard composite RCA - that's the Red/White/Yellow cable) is a quick process; some other TVs take a few seconds to load the new input, and this takes less than one second to recognize and display the new input.I don't use the remote control (synced the TV with an RCA universal remote), but it came with provided batteries and initially worked fine. Keep in mind that RCA is a very popular universal remote manufacturer, and as TCL owns RCA, you'll have no problems at all syncing RCA remotes with this TV. I also don't use the built-in speakers (running through a receiver and independent speakers), but I'll echo that they're not fantastic and would better suit a casual listener, perhaps in the bedroom, rather than an enthusiast in an entertainment room.Finally, the included 2-year warranty is terrific. I'm also buying an additional 3-year warranty via CostCo (it's $20 cheaper there with a CostCo Membership).All said and done, this is hands down the best consistent TV deal out there.

The picture is clear, sharp, free of dead or stuck pixels, and the backlighting is even. It also has a nice solid picture, unlike many other cheap LCD screens which show obvious distortion and a kind of \"swirly\" pattern. The color quality isn't quite as good as a 4x more expensive TV, but it's still very nice, and I have no complaints there! (also, I looked in the back, and it is indeed a Samsung LCD panel)Second, there are more inputs and outputs than most any other TV under $1,000. It features one output that most other TVs lack at this point, and that is analog RCA audio out, so older sterios and receivers can be hooked up without a digital to analog adapter.Third, the 60Hz, 8ms refresh rate is perfectly good for gaming. I'll be using this for gaming more than anything, and the movement is nice and smooth with both the Wii and the XBOX 360. It also works well with my HDMI capable Asus netbook. There is a little stuttering with 24fps movies, though (typical of 60Hz screens).Fourth, the sound quality from the speakers is decent after adjustment. It's pretty flat sounding out of the box, so I used the internal equalizer to add more clarity and depth by turning up the high and low frequencies. This does not affect the audio out, which is completely separate from the internal speakers. It's nothing great on its own, but the TV speakers combined with my sterio setup sounds excellent!Fifth and last, the TV looks great. The screen is anti-glare, but it doesn't sacrifice clarity. The simple frame and stand look very nice as well as clean. The glass stand is also very sturdy, and doesn't let the TV wobble (it is fixed though, and can't be rotated). Power is indicated by a tiny blue LED in the bottom left corner. The remote is basic, but functional. I couldn't ask for anymore from it at this price.Although it lacks some of the premium features of more expensive TVs, like internet or a 120Hz refresh rate, this  is without a doubt the BEST value in its class, and I'm glad I found it!

Another problem is that with the connection to the PC, there is a problem connecting in 1920x1080P resolution using HDMI or DVI to HDMI cable.

I took a chance on this TV since it was so highly rated. I can see what all the hype is about! This TV is certainly the best budget TV I have ever seen.Pros:+ Probably the most important point: picture is very nice. The display is really made by Samsung and it has nice colors and a good backlight (some light bleed though, that never really bothered me). I don't have HD cable but the basic cable looks really good. Tried a movie in 720p (see below) and it looked fantastic.+ Speakers are decent.+ Easy setup, good menus for tweaking options.+ Lots of jacks including HDMI ports, very cool.+ Channels change pretty quick, a lot faster than other HDTV's I've seen.Cons:- VGA port (-1 star). I wanted to also use this TV as an external monitor for my laptop to watch movies on and I was unable to get 1920 x 1080 resolution (only outputted 720p). Another Amazon user said you could set some of the options up in Windows 7 to force 1080p but I was unsuccessful in doing so. Yet another user experienced the same issue, contacted TCL and they were told that it could not handle 1080p in VGA, only in HDMI. Pretty odd in my opinion. I haven't hooked up HDMI yet but I will attempt this and hopefully I can get the 1080p output from my laptop. Else, I will force the resolution via non-Microsoft software via VGA (easy to do but has the chance of ruining your TV, others have had success). Think carefully if you want to use this as a computer monitor if using VGA only.- Minor point but the USB port is only for pictures and mp3's. Your external drive has to be formatted to FAT to do so (older standard). Didn't bother with this but I suppose it's nice to share pictures on a USB stick.Overall, I couldn't be happier for the amount I paid for this. It is easily worth an extra $200. It is not perfect but know what you are buying. This is not a smartTV or a high end HDTV.

This was my very first HDTV purchase, and I was looking to find a high-quality HD set at a good price.After searching around, I saw many TV's in the 40-inch range were all at least $400-$500.  For $300, the most you could get was 32-inch sets.  That's why when I saw this for about $300, I jumped on it.I've had it for a couple weeks now, and here's what I like:- I know many reviewers were complaining about the sound, and I did find the sound somewhat \"tinny\" as others have described.  I changed some of the sound settings as other reviews suggested, and it sounds much better now.- The display itself looks great - crisp and clear.  I played around with some of the picture settings like brightness, etc. like the other reviewers suggested.  Note that your exact settings will vary based on the lighting conditions around your TV and your own personal preferences.- Cost.  Again, big screen for the price.- It came well-packaged and I had zero dead pixels.  Also, I did not have to do any type of firmware upgrade.- You can remove any inputs not in use from being displayed (so you won't need to cycle through a long list of inputs when all you have is 1 being used).Here's what I don't like:- You cannot label the inputs with your own label.  You can only use the Presets they have available (Blu-Ray, Game, etc.).  Since I hooked up both a PS3 and XBOX 360, I have one of them labeled as a Blu-Ray (the PS3) and the other labeled as Game.- Splash screen.  Every time you turn on the TV, a splash screen comes up with the name of the company, \"The Creative Life.\"  Kind of annoying, but it only lasts a second or two, and I've become accustomed to it.Overall, the things I dislike are minimal in the grand scheme of things.

It arrived quickly and in great shape. Set-up was fairly simple, the longest part was attaching the stand. I had everything working and it had a clear, crisp picture and great sound. Later in the evening I turned the TV back on and channels started changing by themselves. I orginally thought it was scanning or I had hit a button and it was stuck. I checked everything, had to turn the TV off to get it tt stop. The next morning it did it again, so I checked on-line and for this model it was suggested to install the firmware update. Thanks to the previous reviews I found everything I needed and completed this process. The final step in the process was for the TV to \"reboot.\" It shut off and was supposed to turn back on in 30 seconds. Not only did that not happen, I could not get it to turn on again. I tried many different things and nothing worked. I called TCL and they were not open on Saturday. Thanks to Amazon's wonderful return policy UPS is picking up the TV on Monday and I am going to try this again. I am taking another chance because I LOVED it until this happened. I am hoping that the next one does not change channels or turn on by itself as others have indicated, because I do not want to install the update again.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "First time LCD owner", "Author": "TXGarrett", "ReviewID": "RALT81L3MQ6CS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Sony Trinitron died right after Christmas.  I had been thinking about buying a new tv for Christmas because I knew the prices would be great.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that Amazon still had great prices for this tv even after Christmas.  I purchased this tv at 3:30pm cst on Thursday for $299 and it was sitting in my living room by 9:30am Saturday!  It was supposed to arrive on Friday, but there was a shipping hiccup which delayed it by one day. One phone call to Amazon and they refunded me the $3.99 for one day shipping PLUS made sure I received Saturday delivery to get my tv asap!  Thank you Amazon for correcting the problem fast.On to the TV:I made this purchase because of a previous review from another Amazon customer who showed that the LCD screen itself was made by Samsung!  I wanted a Samsung, but was going to go with a smaller size because of the prices.  My parents have a 42\" Samsung LCD HDTV, My sister has a 42\" Samsung LCD HDTV, and I love Samsung products as well.  The price for the product is fabulous AND it's true that the LCD screen is manufactured by Samsung.  I've got the same product number and Samsung stamp that the other customer was talking about!!!!  The picture quality is wonderful!  No dead pixels, fuzzy lines or any other things one could worry about.  Remember I'm coming from a perspective of a person who has never owned a LCD, Plasma, LED, or any kind of HDTV.  However, I've seen lots of them in the stores, restaurants, friend's houses, etc.  Therefore I feel that for the price this television blows the competition away.  It came with a 2 year warranty and since I bought it with my AMEX card that warranty will be extended by another year.  3 year warranty on a $300 LCD TV with awesome color and clarity.  The speakers on the set itself isn't wonderful, but it would suffice until better speakers could be purchased.

If you know where your USB port is and can find the firmware upgrade on their website this should be no problem.  Maybe they decided to drop the price to get rid of the ones that needed the upgrade?  I scanned my channels and the TV is up and running.  I wasnt too proud about the TCL logo on the front of the unit so I took a black sharpie and colored it in.  I let it dry and went over it again with a second coat.  My wife looked at it from about 2 feet away and claimed that she could even see where the loco used to be.

I knew I wanted to buy a big TV, but did not want to pay $500 or $600.  I found this TV and was a little bit cautious due to the incredibly low price and relatively unheard of brand.After doing some research, I found that TCL is currently only being sold through Amazon.  Seeing how Amazon has the best customer service in the business, I assumed that they must have done their homework and checked in to TCL before carrying their product.As for the TV, it is perfect.  Upon opening the set, I had to disagree with all of the negative reviews I had read so far.  The remote control is not cheap feeling, the sound is comparable to any other set with stock speakers, and the picture is top notch.  I am fully satisfied with my product and would purchase another if I needed one.Another aspect I enjoyed was the included base.  Instead of a plastic base to stand the TV, this one is made of glass and is very good looking.  Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, but it really does a great job keeping the TV in place.  It is a sturdy mount and I do not have any concerns about the TV being knocked over.5 Stars for this TV, great buy.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "2 line showing on the screen after 9 months", "Author": "Peng Xiao", "ReviewID": "R24MITCG3PDMZQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Both the TV and amazon are good.2 things I want to mention,1.

While I was trying to figure out what it was, another line (this time green and horizontal) appeared...and as of the moment they are still there.....and every once in a while the screen becomes completely green???I really wanted to like this set and give 5 stars, I really wanted to be one of those lucky ones who buys an off-brand that produces great picture and costs so little, so that I can brag about it to my friends :),,BUT no...sorry..not happening, not to me at least.I am sure you all noticed how many DOA products TCL has shipped out with this particular model and I really dunno why...I really dont wanna go through this hassle again and seems like I am just gonna return it not replace it.

I have bought 3 of these TVs so I can't say I hate them...just know that I am not willing to spend 600+ for a 40 inch 1080p screen quite yet. I am saving for Pioneer Elite Plasma. I go big or don't go at all really.  The problem is white bleed from the corners (upper left and upper right).  Flip inputs and go to a black screen and boom....you got some major white bleed through from the LCD panel.  This is a NON-REFUNDABLE issue though.  I didn't even ask TCL but if things hold true from other TV's makers...it's a part of the process of making LCD panels and sometimes...you can get lucky and get one without much bleed through.With that said...my first one was the worst.  It's kinda of annoying bleed through too.  Sometimes it can stretch up to 4 to 5 inches in...depending on the temp of the LCD panel.  I find myself just full screening Low Def content just to stop my fixation on the flaw.  My other 2 that I ordered....pretty good.  One has a little spot on the upper left...and that's it.  Compared to my first...(that had it both up left and right)...it's acceptable and I don't notice it while watching content that didn't fill the area.  3rd one...even better.  Nothing. Nadda. No bleed to speak off.The other 2 are going back in the boxes as gifts (I am keeping the bad one...just in case this issue progresses and I need to RMA).I am only giving it \"4 stars\".  Just because of the luck of draw on the quality control issue.  Turning my TV on...before shipment should have resulted in being tossed IMHO...no matter what price.  It's quite annoying. Other 2 are good....so I took just one star off.I DON'T want to discourage ANYONE from buying a good 40inch though.  It's unbeatable price and picture is great for 320.00.  I can't say for CERTAIN that my issue is normal.

I woke up and checked Amazon for the deal of the day and found this 40\" TCL for $259.99. With Amazon points, $118 out of pocket. It doesn't get better than this.The TV set up quickly. Menus easy to navigate. Great picture and works with the Harmony remote (need to do some tweeking on this one today). Combined with a Samsung Wireless Blu-Ray  with SmartHub who needs a smart TV.I got it to replace an 8yr old Sony 42\" Grand Wega that did not have HDMI inputs. The Sony still worked great but at this price I did not have to listen to the wife complain about the switch. And it has a much smaller footprint than the Sony. She did notice this smaller footprint in the living room.BTW, the shipping was free and I was stunned when it was here the next day 12/24. This was above and beyond for an order that was  not Amazon Prime*****************Just to update. The TV has been set up for a week and all is well. Still love the Hi-Def picture, color is great.I was able to get the Harmony Remote working better. The issue appears to be that their codes don't have this model listed yet and I had to use the codes for the 11TA, which has one less input. I renamed one input on the Harmony menu to match the 2 Component color inputs on the 12TA, this may not have been necessary since it appears that the Harmony steps through the inputs but it made it easier to follow the progress.  And I deleted one input on the TV so the Harmony would see the same number of inputs as it had in it's code list. The Harmony now steps through the inputs and the TV has integrated nicely into the AV surround sound system.Getting it all working together took an afternoon - AV Receiver, Blu-Ray wireless connected player, WII,Harmony remote,VCR (yeah I know real old school), Netflix, and Cable.Hook time was NOT THE FAULT OF THE TV, I think it simply shows that the days of simply plugging in a TV are long gone as systems become more complex.******************Someone else reported a problm with a Dark Picture.

It did, but then I learned Dish Networks' HD DVR (VIP 722K) does not provide enough outputs, those available were used for other devices.With a call in to TCL customer service then made to figure out what to do with a 2 year warranty coverage... they offered...eventually...wanted an 'original receipt'...to send a replacement board.But the board was 'not in stock', so \"let us know when you receive it, we'll backorder for you...then we'll call a tech to come to your home to replace it for you\". Great, I should have asked for that in the beginning, but didn't realize the SIZE of my TV was what was used to determine if a 'tech would come' to our home.

I asked how they know what parts are needed since no tech has came out and they reply new power board will fix all  the problems. Ok fine we are at 35 days later still no part no technician and no TV TO WATCH ! I call again this time Im told the first story about a tech coming out to fix it. I explain how I have been told two different storys already and still have no working tv. I get put on hold and then hung up on. I call back get another person who says oh sorry The dept that deals with the parts is closed for lunch. She will call me back in an hour and  1/2. I am sure that will happen just like Im sure some one was coming to fix my TV 35 days ago. I will call again and get a new set of exscuses as to why it has not been taken care.

Unfortunately that doesn't help without a technician to replace them. Never got a call back. Emailing every week I would get the same response, don't know what's going on with techs, techs are busy, etc. After a month I started attempting to call A&D;, I tried multiple days during their business hours and gave up after spending an hour+ on hold.

I had low expectations because it was such a low price for a 40\" set. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works great.I have a PS3 hooked up to it for blu-ray and Netflix, and an Xbox for games.The only beef I have with this set is that it does have some motion blur, which is to be expected with a 60 HZ set. It's only noticeable to me on animated type shows, like South Park. This is the most obvious when they show the character's eyes in South Park, which is just a black dot surrounded by a white circle to make their eye. If there is any movement, you can see where the pupil of their eye was just a second before. This is because cartoons use the whitest and blackest pixils, so it makes it obvious.Game play is great on this tv, no lag while playing MW3. Blu-ray looks great, but the sound is sub par so you will want to get a sound bar for this set. The price to quality ratio is off the charts, don't spend an extra $100-$200 for a brand name set unless the brand name on the TV means more to you than the picture. It's easy to set up.

The only thing I do with this TV is play PS3 games and watch movies and TV streaming from my computer, using the PS3's wifi. No problems with any blurred images, or ghosting or whatever.I set the TV to Cinematic mode, turned sharpness to 0...the only thing I have to do is change the brightness level for certain games....some games are darker than others and I have to adjust the brightness accordingly. I'm not an expert, but I know what basic over saturation is and when things just don't look right. The lighting in the TV is pretty even, blacks look black, colors look natural.I don't care about the TV's included speakers, I will never use them and people that do use the built in speakers are idiots. I have a 5.1 surround sound that is not fancy by any means, it's a 200 dollar Pioneer sound system that was made for the Xbox 360 like 6 years ago that you can't even buy anymore, but it's a great sounding system for the price and I'll continue to use it until it dies.I'm sorry but even if I was using this TV in the bedroom, which I also think is stupid and I don't understand why people watch TV in the bedroom, a bedroom is for having sex and sleeping...watching TV is meant for the living room on a couch. Anyway, even if for some reason beyond my control a TV magically appeared in my bedroom, I would hook up external speakers, as all speakers built in to TV's since the creation of the very first TV have always sounded at best sub par, and at worst more horrible than even a pair of 6x9 1980's car speakers that had a blown voice coil but people think it sounds good cuz it has the \"bass\". A flat screen speaker simply does not have the proper dimensions to accurately reproduce sound of any type...forget about bass, and even the mids and highs will be tinny or harsh or just bad since I doubt they have actual separate piezo tweeters or anything actually good....so just save your ears and get a 50 dollar set of Logitech computer speakers to connect to the TV, it will be light years beyond any built in computer speakers.Bottom line is, this TV is awesome, I would not hesitate to buy TCL in the future in an even larger size when it's time for me to upgrade. This TV has more input and outputs than all the TV's I looked at in the price range...I would have to pay over 500 dollars to get a better TV of the same size or slightly larger 42 inch, and that was out of my price range, plus none of the other TV's had a 2 year warranty, or a USB port.

My 55\" Samsung DLP would've cost over $500 to replace and with 720p technology I figured it wasn't worth the money to replace it.  After researching various brands online and in stores I decided I didn't want to plunk down over $500 dollars for a comparable \"name brand\" model with the same specs.  I am extremely happy I purchased this product.  The two year warranty really sold me on this product though.  The picture quality is pretty good but wont blow you off your feet.  You will need to adjust the heck out of it to get the right quality for your viewing pleasure so take your time with this part.  The sound quality is not the best but I have a Vizio 47\" LCD 1080P in my living area and that sound quality is not the best either.  However, I decided to put this TV on the wall and it made a heck of a difference as the speakers are on the bottom front of the TV. Therefore, the sounds \"bounces\" off the wall. Much better than on the stand.  Amazon Prime allowed me to receive the TV in two days which I truly appreciated.  If you are a previous HD owner you will be pretty happy but not as happy as someone who never has owned one before if that makes sense.  First time buyers will be AMAZED but previous HD TV owners will do A LOT of adjusting to get just the right picture.  The cost value if worth it though.  I paid $299 with no tax or shipping.  How can you go wrong right?! You can't beat the price and if it doesn't last past the 2 years you still received the bang for your buck.

I've lived with the TV for a week and it's been great so far.  I am using this as my primary TV.PICTURE QUALITY:At $350+tax+free prime shipping, I cannot complain at all.  1080i from my cable tv looks good, everything is bright and vibrant.  Just be sure to turn it off eco mode, which detects the light in the room and dims the backlighting (can be quite annoying and useless).  1080p from my xbox and computer looks even better.  At 60hz refresh rate, you will not get that life-like frame rates from your blu-rays.  One issue with the picture is glare.  Dark scenes will catch a lot of glare if you have a lot of windows or lights.  My next TV, i will definitely watch for this.  There is some cropping on the sides, not too bad, i find using \"NO OVERSCAN\" works best for most situations.SOUND QUALITY:Not great, but you can live with it.  I purchased a pyle mini amp from amazon to power some old bookshelf speakers.  Plugged it into the audio out with the rca cable, and the sound is great.  However, you cannot control the volume of the rca sound output from the tv's volume, you have to use the amp's volume controller.  Slightly inconvenient, but if you hook up a receiver, you might have a remote to control the volume.  Doesn't bother me for the price i paid.ON/OFF:Takes approximately 15 seconds to boot on and off.PICTURE SETTINGS:Does not save picture settings across different inputs, at least not for HDMI.TV STAND:Wobbles, and is not even.  A pain to screw on.RESPONSIVENESS:Pretty responsive in terms of remote input.  I know this may not be the case for other low end TVs.ISSUES:Did not output sound when i hooked up HDMI #2 to PC from the RCA out, but it worked when i hooked it up to HDMI #1, and HDMI #2 with my tv works with RCA out.  Not sure why that happened.LONGEVITY:My biggest concern is will this TV last me?  I am well aware that this TV comes with a two year warranty, but would it be worth the hassle to get it fixed?

One thing that i notice though is that when its hooked up to like basic cable it doesn't show up as clear. I live on a college campus so you know you dont get the best cable. Overall it shows pretty great. I would recommend digital cable though because you get a box with all the HD inputs and outputs and it shows up really clear. Also one of the things i was hearing was dead pixels that people were getting when they bought there tv. I did have one on mines but it is barely noticeable unless you have the tv on showing a black screen but other then that you cant tell. One thing that i liked about this tv besides the price is the HDMI. I like to watch my videos from my computer or my camera on the tv. I have a professional studio camera and it looks amazing on this tv. the quality is so clear even when im watching youtube videos from my computer on the tv. Its also good for playing your pc games on the tv as if it were an xbox or playstation. The sound and picture is amazing on here. it has all the ports to connect any computer and pretty much and device. it evens has USB which allows you to play music straight from a usb drive. all you do is plug the USB in and go to media, then it reads the USB and plays the music. also it lets you play photos from there as well. My sister and her husband bought a 46 inch tv from walmart for almost $600. it has the sames features it just cost way more. This is a good buy...plus you get a 2 year warranty so you cant beat that. Also its so cheap that i think this item has a high resale value. So i think if you buy it and decide to sell it you can easily make your money back or possibly make more.

I'm from China and i know it's great domestic brand there, obviously not as good as SONY, Panasonic or maybe SHARP here and there, it's for sure better than Dynex or whatever sold cheap here that is nothing in US or China. So if ur not considering high-end TVs as those three and choosing Made-In-China, choose some brand that is trusted there and those trying to build their name here in US.Back to the TV, starting is slow as commented before, but not as long as 15 sec i think.

Cable not ready yet so unable to test with ESPN HD.One more thing, i failed to find the energy info prior to purchase, and it's on the label of the real thing so it's better to share it now: \"$23 based on  11 cents per kWh and 5 hours use per day\"Overall a steal to own a '40 1080P TV with 330", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Non Technical Person.

They have confirmend that it is a problem they are working on but don't know when it will be resolved. For more info see discussion groups at end of the review section.Bought two of these for spare bedrooms about 30 days ago. One set was dead on arrival so it went back to Amazon for an exchange. The other set worked but had a couple of quirks. The biggest one was the USB port. The set offers to show photos from a USB Memory stick which it does but the system is not very intuitive. The biggest problem is that when in slide show mode there is a banner with the picture description and file information that does not go away. When you bring up a single picture the banner goes away after a few seconds but it will not go away in slideshow mode. It takes up a quarter of the screen and looks ridiculous. I called their Customer service line and they said they had heard about the issue before and asked me if I could send them a photo of the screen with the banner. I did that several weeks ago but have not heard a thing. Dropped the CSR rep an email telling him that I was going to have to return both TV's to Amazon if I didn't hear from him. Still no word so I am going to call once more before sending the TV's back. The picture is acceptable for the price but is not as good as the bigger brand names.

The color is great. Sound is better than the large tube TV that we just got rid of.If anyone has a problem with the sound then just add a separate sound system, this HDTV is large enough to justify it.As some mentioned there is a *faint* light bleed thru in the upper left corner.This can ONLY be noticed when the top part of the screen is very dark or black.But YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT. Strangely enough I don't recall many movie producers that pack a lot of action up in the corners.No stuck pixels.The remote IS a little touchy. Button presses have to be quick. Hit a 4 and if it isn't fast you get 44.

It's got a nice price tag, and that one reason I purchased this over something like Sony or Samsung or any of the more popular brands.Second, I give this a 3 star because I can't seem to find an email address to contact TCL to write them about an issue I'm having with Blu-ray at the moment.  Because this is my first HDTV, I'm not really sure if this is normal or not.  Here's what I wrote in my email to them:\"Hi,I recently purchased a TCL 40\" HDTV off Amazon.com, and I have noticed something that is a little peculiar about the picture quality.First off, I bought the tv in order to watch Star Wars on Blu-ray (so yes, I also have a Blu-ray player).  I watched the first 2 movies and didn't notice anything, but when I was watching the 3rd and 4th movies (thus far, I haven't tried the last 2), my brother and I noticed the quality shift between being really clear and kind of gritty (almost like older films will look like).  It's most noticeable while looking at a plain background during the movies, but up close it can still be seen.  I'm unsure of how to describe it really, but I was wondering if all HDTVs have something like this occur?  Or if it might just be the one I own?  I have yet to try other Blu-ray videos so I'm not sure if this is an isolated incident concerning the video choice or not.  But I will try to watch other films on Blu-ray and watch out for this same problem.  If you have any information for me regarding this issue, please let me know.\"Again, I'm unsure if this is normal or not, but it can be distracting when watching a video.  If anyone has had this happen and if there is a way to fix it, please let me know.  You can contact me at aquatec1234@hotmail.com.  Just make sure to write in the subject line something to do with this issue.  Or you can just comment on this review.

There isn't a user selectable picture size adjustment and the range or picture color, brightness, backlight adjustments seem limited, you notice but it hasn't been a problem.

Bottom line it works well and is very sharp and clear and a small group can see clearly at 1920x1080 resolution which was my goal.Several specific observations:1) I can set the resolution at 1920x1080 using componet video (RGB) input.  This is how I have it set up, as the second of two monitors attached to my PC running Windows7.  I also use it as the PC's speakers using the RCA audio inputs.2) Using VGA input there is a quirky issue.  If I power on my computer connected to a different monitor at 1920x1080, and then switch the cable to the TCL display, the TCL monitor displays 1920x1080 just fine.  But if the computer re-detects the monitor (e.g. after rebooting) it sets it to 12??x768 and will not allow higher settings (even after checking a Windows option to allow settings that the monitor does not support). I think that this is a firmware issue with the TV and if the TCL monitor reported to Windows that it supported the higher resolution that it would work.  TCL phone support just said that the 768 resolution was the highest it supported with a VGA connection.  They said \"best\" performance required an HDMI connection, but could not say that this would solve the issue.  I have not tried using the HDMI input because I do not have a DVI-to-HDMI (DVI being standard computer digital video output) cable, but I know that they are available.  But as I said it works OK using the composite input on the monitor.  I use the SVIDEO output of the computer along with a break-out cable that provides the separate RGB cables.3) Regardless of how I connect the TCL monitor, at 1920x1080 I lose a little desktop on all four edges.  This would be a big problem if it was the only monitor attached to the computer, but since I have it set as my \"second\" monitor it is not a big problem.4) Since it is after all a TV I just had to go buy a $10 indoor antenna, and in my city office it receives about 25 over-the-air stations just fine, with good picture quality.

I couldn't find remote codes for TCL on my FIOS remote, but the search feature on the remote seems to have worked ok.  We can turn the tv on/off, control the volume and inputs with the FIOS remote.  The hardware seems sturdy and looks good.  I think it has 4 HDMI inputs in all which is good, but I wish there were more than two on the back.  I don't really understand the side inputs for HDMI.  Also, the default picture quality for the TV seemed to be something called ECON which I would guess is \"economy\" and looks really dark and bad.

It was very easy to set up our DirectTV, DVD player and Xbox 360 inputs, as well as switch among them as needed.The picture needed very little adjustment out of the box. We identified three scattered dead pixels on the edges, which is not bad on a 40\" screen. We would never have noticed them without closely examining a completely black screen. The viewing angles are really excellent compared to many LCDs I have seen. You have to be far off to the side (far enough to clearly see the cables in the back) to see any changes in picture quality.We never had a separate speaker system with our previous tv so we are quite happy with the sound, although it is certainly not theater quality. There are multiple ports to hook up an external sound system if you want one.Since I gave this a 5-star review you can guess that we haven't dealt with customer service at all.

The reason I got this TV was for my grandparents.  They usually buy whichever TV is pushed onto them buy the electronics store, so I wanted to just get them a basic TV that would meet all of their needs without costing a fortune.  This TV does that.  My grandparents have an up-scaling DVD player and HD satellite TV, but other than that they really don't nitpick the little details that a home theater fan might.  They noticed that compared to their previous 32\" Toshiba, their sound was much louder & cripser (probably due to larger speakers).  They also mentioned the picture seemed smoother & clearer - which probably is more because of the newness and higher refresh rate, compared to their 3 year old Toshiba.  They also mentioned that the remote was easier to use - easier to see the wording & less buttons.I can also add that the TV seems really light and mostly plastic around the edges (except the base which seems to be made of a heavy glass or gorilla glass type substance).  When I set up their TV I moved it direct to their house without breaking a sweat.  Any person with enough strength to carry 30 lbs, will do fine.  This could be a plus for those that hate the weight of moving TVs or fear the wall mounting process due to heaviness.  The \"mostly plastic\" exterior could also be a negative if it is dropped - I wouldn't expect this TV to be built for very much abuse.I think this is a perfect entry level TV for someone just getting into HD and wanted to test out a new Blu-ray player, etc.  If your looking for bells and whistles, look somewhere else though.  Most TVs now push the added features such as Wi-Fi, 3D, built in apps like Facebook, etc.  You will not see those premium features here, but you will get a good picture with surprisingly nice sound for such a low priced set.  I could've gone with a different and more established company name, but instead I decided to get a larger set.  My grandparents saw how much more TV they could get for the money and they were happy.  In many cases the big tier companies would sell a 26\" set for this price, maybe 32\" in the mid range companies.  That is a lot to consider when you realize your needs.  This 40\" TLC works great and coming from Amazon allowed me to feel secure that customer service issues would be handled quickly and professionally.Sure I haven't had to use the 2 year warranty, but I feel that if this TV lasts through the 2 years that would be longer than some LCD & Plasmas I bought in the past.  I spent over $100 on a warranty for a TV at Walmart that died in less than 30 days, so even warranties are worthless if you pay high prices for them (the warranty didn't extend to the replacement TV).All and all, consider this a beginner's HD TV.

You have the option of naming all your different inputs which would be nice if this were my living room t.v. where everything is hooked up to.2) Audio quality is good. No complaints. Loud and clear at just \"10\".3) Video is very good for a t.v. that is around three hundred dollars for a 40 inch screen. Comparing it to other display models at retailers I think it holds up with a couple hundred dollars of its price range. Obviously when you get into the $800-$1500 Sharp, Sony, Samsung t.v. range the quality goes up significantly. You can't complain for the price you're getting. Its VERY good just not top tier.4) If this were my main viewing t.v. I would probably spend more money for the best picture.

The cardboard box is what you would expect for a flatscreen and the styrofoam blocks were very sturdy. I'm not a fan of two-piece boxes but it worked out fine, even with being transported 250 miles in the back of my car. I hate seeing reviewers give 1 star for the product because the shipper destroyed the unit in transit - I don't see what more you could expect from Amazon or TCL as far as packaging. The TCL box was packaged as well as any display I've purchased in the past.Others have complained about the base, but I have no issue with it. Mine was fortunately not broken in transit. I'll wall-mount it sooner or later anyway.As for TV performance, I've had it set up less than a week but so far so good. I've owned two Panasonic plasmas over the past 5 years (a 42\" EDTV and a 50\" HDTV) and a Samsung 42\" plasma, as well as a 26\" Panasonic LCD. While I prefer the plasma's picture, the TCL has a bright, crisp picture, and definitely shines in brightness and color, as most LCDs do (compared to plasmas). I am pleased with the display for the price I paid. SDTV picture on analog cable has some ghosting, but that seems common to LCDs. My plasmas do not exhibit that behavior. The HDTV picture is sharp and shows depth, though my cable HD channels exhibit the typical compression artifacts - an issue with my provider, not the TV. The TV found all of the analog and digital channels I expected it to find, so I have nothing to report about the tuner other than it works well. Netflix in HD on my Roku looks great, but I do need to play with the picture controls a bit more.I do find it amusing that others complain about a lack of features on a $300-320 TV. I guess my mindset is a bit different - I hadn't bought a new TV in about 2 years - so I don't expect to have Netflix, Hulu, etc. built into the TV. I use my Xbox/PS3/Bluray/Roku boxes for that as necessary. Buy a $45 Roku LT or WDTV player and you're set. In my opinion, the TV has plenty of ports, with the only negative being the lack of an optical audio out. Coaxial audio will work fine, though.All in all, a super value. 5 years ago when I bought my first Panasonic plasma EDTV (848x480 resolution - take that 1080P fanatics! the TV is still running great too) I paid over $1200 for it.

We've been using it every day for almost two weeks and so far so good. We have had no problems requiring updates like some mention. The picture quality and sound are great. The only issue I have with it at this point is that DirecTV does not list remote codes for TCL brand televisions. Reading the reviews of others, I tried ALL of the RCA codes and none worked. I decided to call DirecTV to verify if their remote is incompatible and learned that they do not currently have codes for the TCL brand. However, when I mentioned that I had read that RCA worked for some people the DirecTV representative had me try several RCA codes again only this time I was to try turning the TV off instead of trying the volume like the on-screen remote setup instructs you to do. Well, after trying about 30 different remote codes, several did turn the TV on and off, but we were not able to get any of the codes to control the volume. Regardless, I was elated that I could at least turn off the set with one remote when done watching without having to search for both the TV and satellite remotes.One of the codes that did turn this set on and off was 11953. If this does not work for you try the other RCA codes that are listed. Just remember to try turning the set off instead of trying the volume as the instructions tell you to do. I hope everyone finds this helpful and I wish all a Happy New Year!By the way, I subtracted one star because of the remote code.

With this in mind, I certainly didn't want to spend a lot so when I saw this Amazon deal for $299, I decided to jump on it.  It appeared to me that if it worked when it arrived, then I would probably be okay since most of the bad reviews involved a unit not working after it was unpacked.I ordered it on a Thursday and it arrived the next day.  It was easy to unpack (in fact, a little too easy - they should probably protect it and the stand better in the packaging, but both arrived unscathed in any case).  I connected the sturdy, glass stand with the 4 screws and hooked up the PS3 with RCA cables (don't have the HDMi cable yet).  Turned on and everything works very well.  I was a little concerned with getting a 60Hz screen for gaming, but all the games we have played so far - MW3, InFamous, Gran Turismo, Force Unleashed - all work perfectly.The picture is excellent and the sound is much better than expected.  One disclaimer on the sound - our setup is in a small room and we are playing within 7 feet of the monitor.  Not sure how the sound would be in a larger room like a family room.Since we don't have the HDMi cable yet, we have not played any Blu Ray movies, so perhaps I will update this review when we have done this.Also, I have not applied the firmware update since I have had no problems.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.All in all, I am very satisfied with this purchase and hope to never have the need to use the 2 year warranty.  If something happens after 2 years, then I figure it was only $300.1/4/12 Update:  Got the HDMi cable yesterday and hooked up the PS3 with it and WOW - what an amazing picture!  I really didn't expect that big of a difference in picture quality, but even the 720p games look better.  In 1080p, Gran Turismo looks so real.

Looked like it was worth taking a chance on it even though I'd never heard of the brand.  Wrong!

Checked the outlet, but knew it was fine because the little blue light on the front of the TV was glowing.  Replaced the batteries in the remote control.  Nothing.  No sound, no picture.  Pressed the power button directly on the television.  Nothing.  As instructed in the instruction manual, I unplugged the television and let it sit for several minutes.  Plugged it back in.  Nothing.With a sinking feeling I decided I had to call the TCL service department.  After the person who answered asked a multitude of questions (needed all the TINY numbers on the back of the TV read to them, my name, address, etc., etc.) she ran through a list of things to do.  I had already done them, as I had read the instruction manual.  By the way, I had to laugh when reading the trouble shooting portion of the manual.  It said that if the TV won't turn on one of the things you should do is press the \"MENU\" button on the remote and check something on the menu screen.  LOL  If the TV has no picture, how does one manage to see the menu, I wonder?After talking to the first person at TCL who knew very little, she told me I would need to call another number (surprise!) and not only would they need the information that I had just given to her, but I would need to look up the email which was sent to me confirming that the package was shipped.  Wha?  I had the serial number on the TV, I had given my name, address and other information.  Why is even more information necessary?  When calling a service department, is it not obvious that I indeed owned one of THEIR televisions and was having a problem with it?  Why else would I be calling?  Why do I need to be grilled on every detail of my purchase?  Do they suppose that I am joking and actually do not own one of their televisions?I give up.

Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. I am probably gonna keep it for a bedroom TV but get a good one for my HTPC setup.-- Edit 1/15Finally got 1920x1080. I am not sure how but I think it normally overscans. i hit it off on the remote. picture is terrible though. I had to turn the sharpness way down, around 40, just to read text. It still tells me 1280x 720 is default, but ignore that.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "1st TV DOA, 2nd TV Alive!!!", "Author": "Skyhoneybear", "ReviewID": "R39DYRL196JWIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update (1/13/11)I got the replacement TV in two days (longest two days ever!) and the TV is Alive. It started right up.WOW! I agree with what all the 5 star/4 star reviews say. I am blown away. Coming from a 27 inch CRT to this 40 inch is amazing. All I can say is I didn't realize how the newscasters for the local stations really looked. Bought the cheapest HDMI cord from Walmart, and the picture is streaming just fine.The best part is that my previous TV was an RCA, so Time Warner cable remote works perfectly for the TCL, no programming was needed. So I echo those trying to find codes for your remotes, try RCA.Speakers sounded fine, without our surround sound system, we keep it at a level 10-15 as this is our main TV. When we do use the surround system, it has theater sound quality. Wii looks very good on the TV as well. Because the Wii has WiFi and Netflix, I don't think it is a big deal the TV doesn't have \"apps\" or Internet (or whatever).I have no complaints although it has been less than 24 hours. I was going to give this review 4 stars due to defective first TV, but decided on 5 to include Amazon's awesome return policy.This is a great deal for this size of TV.

Plugged up the TV, and nothing. It seemed like no power was getting to TV. Tried different outlets, nothing happened. All other electronics plugged into outlets worked.The TV looked nice.I'm going to give it one more try and have requested Amazon to send a replacement. If the 2nd TV does not work, I will request a refund. I've already printed the return label and will be dropping off at UPS today. Thanks Amazon for a great return policy.I want this TV to work.

I bought it new from amazon for about $190 and you can't beat that price for any 40\" LCD TV. The picture quality is I'd say a 6 out of 10 in my eyes. Aside from the backlight and contrast there's very few controls to tweak the colors, although the image presets are fine for most uses. The sound is obviously sub-par and has very little base but it does have some volume, and it doesn't distort when turned all the way up. The Remote though, is the worst one I've ever seen on a device, because even though it works and it looks OK, the individual keys stick. One thing that scared me a little bit is that when I went to pick it up at my local UPS location (I missed the original delivery) the box was split in half as if the bottom was never attached. I had to take the TV out of the box at the UPS building because it could not be carried in the bottom half of the box. I inspected of course the TV for physical damage and it looked fine, but I think I got lucky.

Turned the tv on and and everything seemed to work just fine. Hooked up HD receiver and the quality of the picture was perfect although some tweaking may be necessary.

Garbage dump?) now since the first of August 6, 2012.  That makes it 3 months.In talking to my husband last night he said \"I bet the reason these TV's are so inexpensive is they bought up all the discontinued parts sitting around in China, assembled the TV's and sold them dirt cheap.\"  So what if they break?  They are disposable!  Trouble is they don't inform the customers that they are throw-aways.  Instead they talk about their warranty!  And their Customer Service!!!.  The disposable TV theory makes sense to me particularly given the treatment we have gotten.  I am putting this review on EVERY TCL TV even though we only bought the 42 inch version.In looking at other reviews (and not just on Amazon) TCL has this same ho-hum attitude about customer service for ALL of their TV's.  I promise to eat crow if we ever see that TV again, but I don't think I'll be burping feathers any time soon.  I would bet money we will never see that TV again.  I'd appreciate any comments where people have had satisfactory customer service - it might restore my faith that I will see that TV on the front porch in the next couple of years.----------------------------------My original review written in October still stands:When we set it up, we were very happy with the picture quality, there were a few dead pixels, but that doesn't show up much and we weren't concerned. But the whole panel died after only 6 months. We aren't big TV watchers either. The thing was on less than 5 hours a week.So we contacted TCL (after several tries to get them on the phone), they gave us the number of the repair shop we were to send this TV to. After several tries, I got them on the phone. They agreed to send us a box to ship it in (a whole other fiasco, but that's not to do with the TV).We received the packing box (after a couple of weeks). We packed it and sent it to them Fed-Ex the same day.Now the Big Wait begins. After 3 weeks I called (again, several times, for several days before an answer). Oh, its here, it is in our shop and they are working on it. Sometimes it takes a couple of weeks because we are So Busy!!OK. Fine. We wait some more. Three more weeks. I call (yes, again, several times over a period of days before I get an answer). NOW there is a problem getting the part. But it should be in 'any time now'.Hmmm. So I wait some more. Another 3 weeks. I call (here we go again! several times a day, for several days -FINALLY an answer). This time someone let the cat out of the bag and told me that the 'panel' that my TV needs is on 'back order'. They have a warehouse full of TCL TV's waiting for this part. She was honest enough to say that it could be 3 months or 3 years before it is received. They simply do not know.Of course it is not the repair shop's fault. I am mad at them for not being more forthcoming, but it is TCL's fault for not providing proper warranty service - TCL simply does not care about customer service.I will update this review as things change, but things probably won't change. This week I am due to call again. I am nothing if not persistent.So, you can go ahead and buy a TCL TV, and you might get lucky and get one that works for a while. But then you can send it to the repair shop so it can keep mine company - in the 'warehouse full of TCL TV's needing repair'.Fair Winds,Cap'n Jan", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well worth it.", "Author": "Shawn E.

Where do I start...... I bought this tv from the warehouse deal section. It was described as used with a few cosmetic scratches on the stand. I received the tv on time. The tv was packaged well however the other parts were not. The stand was simply inside the box loose and so was the remote and hardware. By the time it it reached me, the remote had been smashed around so bad that it separated into 4 pieces. I am a pretty handy guy so I attempted to snap everything back together. I noticed the metal springs which serve as the battery contacts were lost. I removed similar springs from an old tv remote I was getting rid of and modified it to fit. I snapped everything back together and installed batteries and it works. Second issue was the 4 screws that attach the stand to the back of the tv were also missing. My wife suggested sending the tv back at this point. I rummaged through my screw collection in my shop and found 4 that were the correct fit.The tv is together and working. This is the first \"not new\" product I have ever bought, and I was nervous. This tv is for my patio and i did not want to put an $800 tv outside. This set was $314 so I knew there was some risk involved. The description was that there were scratches on the base of the tv. Luckily the plastic film coating on the glass base had never been removed. After removing the film, the scratches went with it! The film was scratched, not the base. What was NOT in the description was a dead pixel on the screen. This I didn't like. It's bright green and quite noticeable, especially in dark scenes. Since I don't normally buy off brand, seconds or used things.... I'm not sure if this \"is part of the deal\" or not. There were two tv's left at this price. If one or the other had described a problem with the screen, I would have chosen the other one. I was ready to accept cosmetic scratches, NOT screen issues. ANYWAY.... more care in packaging would have made my experience better. A simple Ziplock bag with the hardware and remote control in it and some tape, would have earned this rating another star or two.

ripe-old-age of 25 (please excuse my speech in the video if it isn't clear; the procedure was in my mouth).  For my recovery, my wife and I thought it would be nice to go ahead and pull the trigger on getting a bigger, nicer TV than the 32\" we normally use.  We saw this unit on sale and decided we couldn't pass up such a great offer!  We received the unit on time, and instead of spending the day relaxing in front of our new TV ignoring the stitches in my mouth, I had to spend it trying to troubleshoot a busted TV, calling customer service, and writing a review to warn others of what I found out the hard way.  The silver lining is that getting so mad at receiving this bogus unit DID help me keep my mind off the (albeit mild) pain.  You do get what you pay for and this time it didn't work in my favor.Amazon agreed to send me another unit at the same \"next day\" shipping speed, but since it is Friday, I will have waited 4 days to receive my product that I originally ordered \"next day\".  Amazon was even kind enough to knock $40 off the $115 shipping price.  Amazon is doing a great job of making up for this poor TCL product.  I'll definitely being using Amazon again, but pending how good the replacement unit is, I don't expect to purchase another TCL product and will recommend the same to my friends and family.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "VGA can't support 1080p resolution", "Author": "Leizar", "ReviewID": "R2VMXGGN0Z0FBD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to use it also as a monitor, but I can't set a 1920 x 1080 resolution using the VGA port...

Otherwise, it's a great value.Longer story: I bought one of these and was very happy with the picture quality, etc, but had big problems with the reception. I live less than 10 miles from the broadcast antennas for all the major stations, but wasn't able to get a reliable signal from them even with a decent antenna and a signal amplifier. I plugged the same antenna into a small old TV and got all the major stations without any problems. I returned the TV, got a replacement, and had the same problem. I know it's a small sample size, but it's convincing enough for me to think that the poor over-the-air reception is an inherent problem with this TV. I returned my replacement, got a used Samsung, and I'm much happier with it. The Samsung with an old set of rabbit ears works way better than the TCL with a nicer antenna placed in a different room where I got better reception, plus a signal amplifier.  When you include the cost of all the extra antenna stuff (not to mention the time and hassle of messing with the antenna), the used Samsung didn't cost much more.I'm only giving the TV 3 stars, but I'd give Amazon Customer Service as many stars as I can. Returns were easy, fast and free, the replacement TV showed up in only a couple days, and they were very nice to talk to on the phone. I couldn't be happier with them.One other note for people trying to get broadcast TV.

I called the company and was redirected to the \"second level\" where I was told that I needed to repackage the television and send it back to Amazon since I was still within my thirty days of purchase. Apparently, there was a problem with the motherboard.  I appreciate the ability to return the item, but, frankly, having to repackage a 40 inch television was an annoyance I could have done without.  I made the decision to get a refund rather than a replacement because I just don't have much faith in this company anymore.  Also, we had issues with the smaller television and its stand.  (This company needs to do some major work on its stands and the screws.) Although I called about the smaller television and the fact that the stand does not fit properly, I have yet to hear back. . . still waiting.As far as a review of the television during the period of time it actually worked, I would say that it was an okay television--nothing particularly great.  I guess for a cheap price, it was adequate.  I would not purchase another one regardless of the price.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "First impression -- I LIKE IT", "Author": "JLD \"JLD\"", "ReviewID": "R4BSUQEADVV8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I am a female who is not really all that into TVs but I am technically capable. I know what an HDMI cable is and how to troubleshoot most issues I run into. I cannot comment on how this TV compares to all the other high level brands.  I bought it because of the price, size and options it has.  When it comes to TVs, I am not a high end girl.  I just finished unpacking and setting up my TV, cable remote programmed and all.  It was a snap.  It took me (all by myself) less than an hour to complete, from opening the box to sitting down to write this review.  Keeping in mind, I am a girl so I read the directions.  Also, I did find other reviews very helpful, especially the remote codes that one reviewer (thank you very much) supplied.  Using their advice, I picked the most common RCA code (1000) for ATT cable and it worked.  Just remember, you need to make sure the AT&T; button is reselected on the remote or some weird things may happen.  Like, when I did the guide button, I got the TV guide even though other options were working fine with the remote/TV.  I do have some concerns with quality but like my friend said, with TVs, if they work for the first 90 day you are usually pretty good to go.  If I do have any issues with support, quality or service, I will update this posting.  As for picture and sound quality, looks and sounds good to me.  Much better than the one it is replacing.  This is the biggest TV I have ever owned and that is an adjustment.  Also, the size and picture quality are doing to push me to buy a new DVD player.

If you're concerned about the dead on arrival issue, don't fret, Amazon's got your back!Picture quality:  Excellent. We watched Terrence Malick's \"The New World\" last night and the detail and color depth were stunning.  If you love watching movies, getting this TV is a no brainer.Inputs: Very generous.  It has three HDMI inputs, two component inputs, and a VGA input for computers.  For comparison, my dad's $2500 Samsung LCD only has one HDMI input!Design: Understated, but certainly not ugly, as other commentators have shared.  The speaker grill cover is a nice accent, and the glass base is very substantial; no worries about it toppling over.Setup: Easy.  The first thing the TV does is go through the setup options which makes it easy.  The color management options are very detailed, and run on a 0-100 scale which allows for a lot of fine-tuning.The code that worked for me with my programmable remote was to use an RCA television code: 11781.  (Other RCA codes that may work are 12002, 12187, 12247, or 12234)Cons:Only a few, which is remarkable for a low-cost TV.1.  The first TV that arrived didn't work.  As mentioned, Amazon took care of it, no problem.2.  Light bleeding in the top corners.  Only noticeable on letter box movies when watching at nigh time.  Can be drastically reduced by turning off the \"Light Sensor\" and \"Dynamic Backlighting\" options in the advanced menu.3.  The remote has buttons that are difficult to press.  They can get stuck in place when pressed.  Not a problem for me though I'm using my universal remote from my Insignia amplifier.4.  The screws that go into the bottom of the glass plate are difficult to screw in, I almost stripped one of them by trying to muscle it in, which would have been very bad!Overall a great TV at a great price.

In fairness, I got the Wal-Mart version which appears to be exactly the same as this television listed here, with nearly the same model number (L40FHDM12) - my understanding is the slight variance is that Wal-Mart orders large enough batches to deserve their own #.  I'm reviewing it here because the listing is not maintained on Wal-Mart's website (as it was a temporary special) and I also relied on Amazon's reviews in making my purchasing decision.The Good:*Connections - Amount of connections are good, several HDMIs, AVs, Component, a VGA connection as well as USB connection.  All of them worked well except for the USB, which is largely useless as it has a very small range of file types it will read.  Basically, you can look at .JPGs with it (and about two other file types) but that's it.  I tried a few videos and other files, no luck.*Sound - Reasonable for built in speakers.  I have no complaints.  If you want to shake the floor you'll need something more substantial, but the speakers are good for casual tv/movie watching.*Settings - There are a wide range of settings on the TV.  Only complaint here is that you can't change the actual individual color settings (i.e. red only).*Picture - This goes good and bad.  The good is the picture is quite crisp.  The HD does not disappoint.The Bad:My one complaint - the complaint that killed the deal for me - is this-THE PICTURE COLOR - The picture color on the televisionS (yes, multiple) are awful.  The crispness is fantastic but the colors look drab.  Everything looks like it was shot on a rainy day.  To compensate for this I tried upping the color, contrast, brightness, etc.  What I wound up with then was a horribly contrasted overbrightened (blacks look high gray) picture, still with bad color.  And believe me, I tried.  I used calibration images, everything.  I tried it with regular DVDs, Blu-Rays, hooking up a computer, streaming video, you name it.  Using a calibration disc to make sure contrast and brightness were correct resulted in the colors being extremely drab.  No manner of shifting settings would work.  For instance, at no point did any of the greens ever look normal.  And the presets that came with the TV (i.e. cinema) all looked universally dark and drab.  Playing video games was hard as well, for instance the gun in Call of Duty looked about 90% like a black blob with no definition.After reading reviews here and at Wal-Mart (mostly good) I figured the TV I bought was defective so I got a replacement set.  It looked *exactly* the same - I ran them side by side, same scene, same movie, at the same time.  Awful color.My conclusion is it would be an ok set to throw in a guest bedroom but in my experience using it for day-to-day viewing would be distracting.  And I suppose if one was upgrading from a 27\" tube TV it may look good in comparison to that based simply on the crispness.  $300 for a 40\" TV is ridiculously low price but I figured I would try it.
