Found this Sharp at a good price so decided to give it a try.  I don't have the HD upgrade on my Direct TV, but the picture is OK for me without HD.  I like the sleek, thin, glossy black cabinet.  I installed it on a wall mount & it worked perfectly.  Have heard other brands have problems with the screws not working to attach the wall mount.  There is a slight problem with these tv's with such thin profiles in that the speakers are really small.  The sound (volume) needs to be turned up all the way to hear it.  I can hear it fine when the volume is all the way up.  I'm happy with the tv, but only gave it a 4 star because of the sound volume.  I would have given it a 4.5 star if that option were available.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV", "Author": "Joo-Hyung Yoo", "ReviewID": "R2KPCZLXEE3F2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, the picture quality is very vivid and nice...  People comment on the sound quality is a bit less than expected but since it's small sized for small space, the sound is ok.  The most benefit for me is that the tv has both tuner, digital and analogy so I can watch all the programs even in Seoul,Korea.  The reason I did buy it is the weight which is too light to handle.  I am moving a lot so i only need some information such as tv news or similar programs.  i am very satisfied for the purchasing this tv.  I have watched it for almost 5 months, and still like it.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "april24", "Author": "Red Book Worm \"Terrie\" \"Red Book Worm\"", "ReviewID": "R24NK2PNKNS4FY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this item on Amazon.  The Sharp LC-22SB2*UT 22\" HDTV is wonderful.  I needed a stand alone TV for my kitchen that would fit under my cabinets, on my granite counter tops.  This fit the bill.  The picture is super sharp and the volume is adequate.  Not the best I've heard, but it is fine for the kitchen.  I really like it!", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "great TV", "Author": "joejenn", "ReviewID": "R2JJ050XQFIPOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this as a refurbished model from the factory and it is working great!  (so far--had it 3 weeks)  looks brand new had everything wrapped up like new except for special box that said refurbished and no batteries ffor the remote.  I can not tell in any way that it is not brand new.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great display", "Author": "GD from ND", "ReviewID": "R3M7N7HUWBPKA5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our 3rd Sharp Aquos TV. We have two other TVs and I wish they were Aquos too. The viewing angles are terrific, the screen is plainly visible from almost anywhere in the room. You don't need to adjust the picture controls much and if you do it is easy to set these TVs so they look the same as you move from room to room.The sound is adequate, we run this at about 14 to 18 and it is plenty loud in our bedroom. I don't know how high the sound indicator goes but 14 to 18 is well below half the meter.We are very well pleased with this TV and think you will be too.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Satisfied Customer", "Author": "Evelyn R.
