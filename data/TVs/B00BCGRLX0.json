{"Reviews": [{"Title": "TV will keep you happy until 4K is perfected & prices lowered", "Author": "Concerned Consumer \"Al\"", "ReviewID": "R2B2OOM2YWEIUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*Updated after 9 months*Overall: I have had this TV series for about 9 months now.  I am VERY pleased with the purchase.  Glad I went to the 60\".  The previous ES8000 model was plagued with cloudiness, banding--both gone in F series(55/60\" tested).  Flashlighting is minimal on this set and improved over the ES series.  I needed a LED TV upgrade and was on a budget ($2500 OTD/with tax) that didn't place me in the local array dimming technology zone(I believe to be the best type of TV right now).  Plasma's are too reflective for my environment and the extra heat is unwanted (check out the Samsung PN51F8500 though, sounds like it is well liked).Right away I noticed how solid the TV itself felt.  IF I had to do it over again, I would definitely recommend the 55\" OR 60\" F8000 for others to buy over the ES8000.  Just ensure you get the best deal for it as the MSRP is way overpriced.  For ES8000 owners...I wouldn't upgrade.  No way.  This TV will hold me over until 4K's are on the market for awhile, helping companies perfect the tech and lower the price.Be wary of some of these random 1 star reviews, as many users do not even own the F series TV!  Or they had an issue because they didn't have the right settings configured.  If you read the comments, under those reviews you will see they fixed their issue.  I feel this TV rates 5 stars as I believe this tech is at it's \"ceiling\" and there is minimal room for improvement using edge lit tech.For those who wish the short and simple, thats it!  Keep reading for indepth review.Current FIXABLE problems with firmware 11.16:-3D setting \"light control\" settins on \"high\" resets to \"low\"-Netflix, Vudu, Amazon Prime, DLNA video's all have cinema black disabled(supposedly this can be fixed in app updates but its remained off)Picture Quality: The picture quality on this TV is fantastic especially after a few color tweaks (posted below).  The blacks are so DEEP compared to my last tv(direct lit led).  There is a SMALL amount of flash lighting in all four corners(more noticable on 60\" when in PC mode); I believe this is a fault for ALL edge lit tv's as that is how the image functions.  I can only notice flashlighting in all black lighting with something like movie title in middle of screen and black on rest of screen, or if in PC mode with a most black screen.  Unless you are really looking for it in a black screen and concentrated on a corner you will not notice flashlighting.  Also when testing it, please play a movie or something, as when the menu is up or the TV states \"check source HDMI not connected\" flashlighting is more evident and nobody uses their TV to watch a blank screen.Viewing Angle:  Fairly limited until it begins to wash out(ALL edge-lit tech will have this issue).  You will notice the farther off center you will notice more of a degradation in picture quality.  This doesn't bother me as my \"seat\" is always right in front.  Most end users are not as particular or picky as me when it comes to picture quality, many will not even care or notice a difference until a more extreme angle(an angle you can't reach in the room my TV is in).  I sit about 14 feet away and if I go 4 feet to either side, I cannot notice the picture washing out.Price:  MSRP is overpriced.  Ensure you get a good deal and get a store to pricematch to best price you can find.  The 55\" should be around $1730 and 60\" $1945.  I attempted to get Amazon to price match a store that was not on their official authorized list and they refused (attempted multiple times, through different numbers and chat).  It was a $500 difference.  When I was looking I found the 60\" as low as $2400 at the time. I ended up having the local Best Buy price match this tv for me.  I bought my last flagship Samsung TV in 2008/9.  The A850 model(now in bedroom, this TV still satisfies me and looks better than many lower model new Samsung TV's on market today).Stand:  I hated the TV stand.  To feng shui for me.  My wife loved it though.  It actually fit our TV stand, be warned if you have a small TV stand it will not fit...this stand is very wide.  This helps the tv to appear to \"float\".  It even came with some sort of oversized plastic screws and rope that ensured a child couldn't pull the TV down (smart).  I planned on mounting this TV though like my last TV, so the stand doesn't matter much to me.Wall Mount:  I opted for a low profile wall mount from Monoprice.  The one I picked was $14 and the product ID number is 5918 from monoprice's website.  I linked the same mount below through amazon but it is $8 more here.  This places the TV pretty much ON the wall with this mount.  It's about 19mm off of the actual wall.  I was able to run the power cord and a Redmere technology HDMI thin cord(10ft for $17 over at Monoprice..same cord is cheaper on Amazon)Monoprice 10-Feet HDMI Cable with RedMere Technology.  It came with all the necessary bolts and spacers for the F8000 (1 small/1 large on top bolts and 2 smalls on bottom bolts).  Monoprice Ultra-Slim Low Profile Wall Mount BracketHeat: Had the TV on for 12 hours and couldn't find any hot spots or to much heat to make me worried with how close the TV was to the wall.  Was an issue on certain ES8000 sets last year causing a V spot of cloudiness.Remote: The remote is solid and touch part feels just like a laptop.  It's not a gimmick at all and actually works great.  I find it easy to type with there on screen keyboard.  Came with crappy batteries so I opted for some standard spare ones I had in the house.  It would have been nice to get a standard remote though for older generations that do not like touchpad technology.  *update*  The TV now comes with a 2nd standard remote.  For those of you like me that did NOT receive a remote, apply for free standard remote here: (LINKS not allowed, look in comments for direct link) To manually do it, goto samsung's website and locate your TV i.e. UN60F8000 and click the \"Support\" tab.  On that page at the top there is a blue box that states \"click here to see if you qualify for a free IR remote\".  Click that link and fill the form out and it will inform you if you can recieve the free remote.Extended Warranty: I bought my warranty through Costco's squaretrade deal for $99.  It will cover ME for 4 years.  If I used my American Express card it would have been 5 years.  Research your own warranties and determine if you are ok with how squaretrade handles their warranties, they will not put more money into it then what the TV is worth (pretty sure it is actually what YOU paid for it).  You do not need to be a Costco member to purchase this warranty.Smart Hub/\"Smart TV\" features: Easy, smooth.  It would be nice if it was a bit more customizable.  Its nice to have all apps in one system.  I liked it better than my blurray player app system(panasonic). Browsing the internet is as smooth as Safari on my iPhone 5.  EXCEPT when dealing with flash, then it slows way down...I'm not sure if flash is compatible.  Netflix and Amazon Video stream fine, just wish they had the Smart LED feature.  S-Recommended works for many different providers in my area to include my service which is newer(Century Link Prism TV..similiar to FIOS tv).  Not a fan of motion control, not useful yet, to gimmicky.  Voice seems fairly well if you practice at using it although I had a movie set it off twice in a matter of 3 weeks.  I prefer to hit buttons myself, using your voice still isn't natural to me.  I was able to stream DLNA sources easily(up to 1080P 3D) with no issues wireless on a 5ghz network.  Only issue is DLNA servers on Samsung TV's don't let you fastfoward so you have to find a workaround for certain movie formats.  My solution was using ZappoTV(free app on iphone) to inform my NAS DLNA to stream to TV...then I could FF/Rewind on tv with touchpad remote(flicking remote left or right) OR doing it form my phone.  Samsung's media center is caveman like and basic.  PLEX and other apps available on the TV look so much nicer.  They really need to overhaul how it functions especially since this TV has such a fast processor.Smart LED: This is certainly more of a \"personal\" setting depending on what you prefer to stare at.  I believe if you are a videophile that is obcessed with \"trueness\" leave it on low or off.  I went from 'low' to 'standard' and really enjoy it there.Cinema Black:  I love this feature it certinaly makes the bars more black on widescreen movies.  Again you be the judge of this feature, let your eyes guide you.Devices:  Hooked up my 10-13 year old 1st gen microsoft bluetooth mouse and keyboard.  Worked just fine, somewhat impressed how functional it seemed to be.Banding:  I did several different banding tests and had no banding.  I found none on the 55\"/60\", I have yet to see a 65\" without minimal banding.Stuttering:  I really had to work on finding something to get this tv to stutter.  My bluray player on any movie?  No.  Streaming all different types of formats up to 1080P 3D quality on my laptop to TV via HDMI..no stutter.  Streaming from my NAS(Synology DS213+) to TV with same formats/qualities listed above.  No stuttering.  Other users have noted stuttering on Verizon FIOS though and had to set their AMP to clear.  Mine works great on custom(settings below).Sound: No idea, disabled it to use my own external speakers(newegg runs crazy sales on polk audio speakers) and a Denon 2112CI..link to the current model Denon AVR-2113CI.  A few years ago I spent $700 for Samsung's HTIB.  HUGE mistake, multiple repairs in and out of warranty.  Do yourself a favor and invest in a real audio company that has longer warranties and stand behind their product for longer for audio.The firmware I'm currently running is 11.16.  Right when I started the TV and setup network it notified me that I had an update available.  I click do not update and selected to turn automatic updates off.  Still, Samsung updated the firmware (they are known to sometimes do this) initially.  This can be a bad thing as in the past on other sets they sometimes take away features or make the sets look worse--not better.  Fortunately this has not happened again(6 updates and going strong). On my last TV it was easy to upgrade OR downgrade firmware...now it's a PITA to downgrade but still possible.Evolution Kits:  I think until these kits prove themselves they are a complete and utter joke.  UNLESS these kits prove themselves somehow improving picture quality.  It is possible though with a better PCU, better color accuracy could be obtained.  If they don't at most I might update the last year its \"compatible\" with my set to upgrade the processor.Game Mode:  This setting helps reduce lag while playing through your gaming consoles(Xbox One/PS4).  Its important to update to 11.16 if you want to try game mode as it functions well on more current firmware.  I played BF4 on my Xbox One and did not notice any input lag.  On earlier firmware's there was a noticable different between how great PC mode was and game mode.  Although on firmware version 11.10 and later versions \"Game Mode\" seems to perform slightly better similiar to PC mode.  This is great news as you have much more control over color settings in game mode(such as smart led).  Game mode tests around 26ms and PC mode 28ms.  This is great for gamers!Menu>System>General>Game Mode>OnNOTE: PC mode can only be accessed on sources not assigned to a \"Samsung\" device(i.e. Samsung Bluray) or any input set up with their universal remote system...it renames source forcing a keyboard naming option that does not enable PC mode.  Simply select HDMI 1/2/3/4, select tools(top right), a drop down list should appear, select PC and select it.  This mode/dropdown list is ONLY accessible from HDMI's that weren't previously assigned to a Samsung Product or your universal remote.  If you wish to assign PC mode to a port previously assigned to STB, just delete the universal remote settings.The features currently disabled in 11.16 are:Game mode settings not available:Picture Options:  Film Mode  Auto Motion PlusAdvanced Settings:  10p White Balance (forced off)  Motion LightingPC Mode settings not available(MUCH is disabled):  Picture Mode: Entertain OR Standard only  Color  Tint  Picture Options:  Digital Clean View  MPEG Noise Filter  Film Mode  Auto Motion Plus  Smart LED  Cinema BlackAdvanced Settings:  Dynamic Contrast  Black Tone  Flesh  RGB Only Mode  Color Space (Forced Native)  10P White Balance  Expert Pattern  Motion LightingSummary: This TV is an excellent purchase for the right price.  I believe it deserves 5 out of 5 stars as it has very MINOR flaws: somewhat pricy, stand wide, stutters nonexistent on my tv service(Century Link Prism TV), flashlighting (BARELY there, doesn't even bother me as I believe edge lit tech is as good as it will get and Samsung needs to hurry up and take over sharp's patents so they can get back to local dimming array models OR get more OLED's on the market).Current Color Setting's I'm using from an online forum member's home calibrator's settings and slight tinkering of my own(remember, all sets are different and you should use this only as an end user as a good \"base\" too start with and tweak to your liking's..thats why mine do not match his, also I added turned on cineblack/smartled):Backlight=6(night)-16(day) with best backlight to use being 10-12Movie ModeBL 10Cont 90 (try 95, user preference)Bright 45Sharp 0Color 50G/R 50/50Pic Size - screen fitAdvanced SettingsDynamic Contrast - Off (using it can crush blacks too if not careful)Black Tone - OffFlesh Tone: 0RGB Only Mode- OffColor Space - Auto works well but if unhappy these:Color Space Auto (some might prefer native)White Balance:  ro 23  go 23  bo 25  rg 16  gg 25  bg 2710p White Balance OffGamma- 0Expert Pattern- OffMotion Lighting- OffPicture OptionsColor temp - Warm 2Digital Clean View - OffMpeg Noise Filter - OffHDMI Black Level - LowFilm Mode Auto 2 (if available, otherwise off)Auto Motion Plus > Custon > Blur = 10, Judder = 0, Clear = off (NOTE: if you get stuttering, try turning it from custom onto Clear, the clear option in custom can be \"on\", user preference)Smart LED - StandardCinema Black - OnSystem, Eco Solution, Eco Sensor: OFF3D modeNote: Press the 3D button on the remote and select 2D>3D to put the F8000 into the 3D modeTurn off everything that says Auto to Off Except Film Auto2 in Picture OptionsMovie Mode - Note 2D and 3D on the same HDMI Input have separate memoriesBacklight 20Contrast 100Brightness 46Sharpness 0Color 50Tint 50/50Picture Size - Screen Fit3DPerspective 0Frame Depth 5Light Control > HighAdvanced Mode -Dynamic Contrast - OffBlack Tone - OffFlesh Tone: 0RGB Only Mode- OffColor Space - CustomRed R-38, G-0, B-6Green R-15, G-23, B-9Blue R-9, G-0, B-51Yellow R-47, G-52, B-9Cyan R-14, G-51, B-53Magenta R-41, G-0, B-48White Balance 27 29 28 0 8 50  ro 27  go 29  bo 28  rg 0  gg 8  bg 5010p White Balance - not accessible in 3D modeGamma -3Picture OptionsColor Temp Warm2Dig Clean View - offMpeg - offFilm - Auto 2Auto Motion Plus - Custom - Blur 10 - Judder 0 - LED Clear Motion Off(if having motion problems, try turning custom off and onto \"clear\")Smart LED OffCinema Black OffXbox One Calibrated: Game Mode OnStandard ModeBL 15Cont 94Bright 46Sharp 0Color 50G/R 50/50Pic Size - screen fitHDMI Black Level: LowAdvanced SettingsDynamic Contrast - Off (using it can crush blacks too if not careful)Black Tone - OffFlesh Tone: 0RGB Only Mode- OffColor Space - AutoWhite Balance:  ro 23  go 23  bo 25  rg 16  gg 25  bg 2710p White Balance OffGamma- 0Expert Pattern- OffMotion Lighting- OffPicture OptionsColor temp - Warm 2Digital Clean View - OffMpeg Noise Filter - OffHDMI Black Level - LowFilm Mode Auto 2 (if available, otherwise off)Auto Motion Plus OffSmart LED - StandardCinema Black - On", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a wonderful television", "Author": "CC reader", "ReviewID": "R1SQELEXDUI0BF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We researched extensively before replacing our 10 year old set.  We knew we wanted backlit LCD rather than Plasma and we wanted to go bigger.  We looked at many sets but settled on the Samsung UN55ES7200 and UN55F8000.  Based upon the reviews there were some issues with the ES8000, which was an early generation of Samsung smart tvs.  While that set is meaningfully less expensive we are glad we went with the F8000 released in 2013.  The picture is incredibly crisp and, despite its size the set is slim and light weight.  The clicker has a touch pad feature and the connections with the internet, HBO, Amazon, Netflix are very easy (even for a non-technically savvy person like me).  It connected easily (although it was missing 2 screws which Samsung sent out very quickly) so set up time was nominal.  There have been no resolution or lighting issues (as have been described in the ES8000).  I have only one constructive comment, the resolution is so very good that you can sometimes see the artificial nature of the movie sets in older movies.  If that is the only problem we encounter I believe that is something that can be overlooked.  We are really pleased with the purchase and, as always, Amazon delivery was fast and convenient.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV Stand is too wide - 1st Thoughts", "Author": "Corey Fisher", "ReviewID": "R2J3ZB1IEYDXU0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am currently reviewing one of these units and will post a more in depth review soon. However, I needed to post this right away for those considering purchasing this tv..Right now, the tv (55-inch) is currently 48 inches wide. The problem I am having with this TV is that the stand is also 48 inches wide, which will be a huge inconvenience to most people. It's too wide for 90% of TV stands out there so be warned before purchasing this tv. It currently is also measured 12 inches depth too. I have yet  to find a tv stand other then an ultra wide or expensive shelf to sit it on. This is another poor example of form over function. I have a feeling Samsung will bite the bullet on this one because of this mistake as most will have a difficult time find a stand to put this on or it will be un-achievable on their current existing stands. This won't be an issue for those wall mounting, but before you buy this TV, you better measure where you'll put it first.**UPDATE - 03/06/2013I have been testing the unit for a few days now and we found a TV stand that can hold the thing. I've raised the review 1-star due to the picture quality being extroardinary, however, I strongly believe the stand is very impractical, hence, the deduction of 1-star. I've actually reached out to Samsung to see if they can design a new retrofitted stand that hold the set and be a bit more practical and release as an accessory, because this thing is ridiculously wide. Alright, enough with the stand now.As for the initial picture quality results. They are outstanding. The back panel is comprised of literally thousands of miniature LED lights that produce very strong light and can dim all the way down to be completely turned off. So far, the factory calibration is much improved over last year's, I doubt we will have to modify it much. The image quality is much better as well, there is currently no observable light bleed or halo'ing around images. Darks are much much darker then the ES series, but the ES series were edge-lit, these new panels are not as they are full back-lit set's. The new sets do eliminate most of the image blur found common on LCD sets and it appears, at least initially, that the image is much faster and responsive. However, fast paced scenes like those in Transformers and etc are still not as clear the Plasma panels, but either way are improved still. Black levels are insane for a LED set and depending on when we measure against the best from LG and Sony, might be some of darkest blacks on a LED set yet. I should note that we havent measured it yet. However, we have put the set in complete darkness and tested it and all we could see were images and no halo, which is huge.3D performance is in fact definitely brighter and smoother and I am unable to identify artifacting or crosstalk whatsoever, however I should note that last year's ES series did a pretty good job at crosstalk reduction, but the new sets are in fact much brighter.Smart Hub - more on this later, but a MASSIVE improvement over anything we've seen yet. The interface is ingenius and amazing at the same time, just make sure to youtube this as the picture will not do it justice. Not only is this software elegant looking, the TV defaults to it when it's turned on as it is essentially the control hub for the set. The quad core in this set makes this dashboard wicked fast and apps pop up in mere seconds. In comparison to last years sets, its seams about 5 times as fast. The last year models will get this functionality via a \"evolution kit\" when Samsung releases those next month.Other misc features - The camera is much improved, more accurately coordinating your movements. Last year models weren't that great until they released several firmware updates to make it usable and practical, but still wasn't that great. These new models are better at tracking movement and resemble the smoothness of the Microsoft Kinect, which is great news for those waving a burrito at the set and dont want to grease up the remote. The voice activation is WAY better, coming close to the ease of use of Siri and maybe, just maybe even surpassing it. So far, I would say the voice recognition is about 90% accurate, compared to last years sets, which I would probably peg at about 75% after the firmware updates. This is likely due to the new software and quad core A15 chipset this new set has. I would assume the new sets will be just as good when they get the evolution kit.If your thinking of this TV or The Samsung F8500 Plama's, I can tell you right now without a shadow of doubt, the F8500 Plasma panels are KING and are much better in image quality and they seams to even be closing in to the quality of an OLED set, which are currently priced at $10,000. The F8000 LED sets are nice, but not F8500 Plasma nice. You'll need to observe both to understand what I mean. More on this later.More to come...**UPDATE 03/07/2013**To clarify, this TV does not appear to be a full array back-lit set, but it uses new technology called Precision Black, which appears to be some kind of hardware filter on the TV set. See below for Samsung's description taken from the manual spec sheet.Micro Dimming Ultimate:Displays a picture that is as true-to-life as possible by maximizingthe contrast between light and dark. Our innovative technologyscans zones across the image and adjusts brightness to deliverdeeper dark tones and brighter whites. It also eliminates the\"halo\" effect and image distortion that can happen with diffusedlights. The Ultimate version of this technology optimizes thequality to new heights by scanning 2 times the number of zonesin the image.Precision Black (Local Dimming):Produces a much greater increase in contrast and black levelsby dimming LEDs behind dark areas of the picture, thus makingblacks darker without affecting brighter elements of the picture.**UPDATE 03/08/2013**One thing I've noticed that might be an issue for a lot people is the smart hub and its multi tasking capabilities. The new Smart Hub is essentially a full blown operating system and can open multiple applications. However, I recommend not opening more then one app at a time. I've noticed the more apps that are open will significantly slow the TV down to the point of almost freezing. So be careful using the multi tasking capabilities.**FINAL UPDATE 03/28/2013**The TV has now had well over 100 hours of burn-in time and we have calibrated the TV. The image quality after calibration is pretty much near perfect color accuracy, which we've never seen before in an LED set. After calibration, the results are amazing and the black levels are the deepest we've measured on an LED set, even more so then the localized dimming sets from Sony and LG last year.Our final calibrated settings are as follows. (Note, this is what worked on our set and shouldn't be duplicated unless by a certified professional or by using your own eye with blu-ray calibration software).We started out with the movie mode, decreased back-light to 8, set gamma to -1, scaled contrast back to 75, left sharpness at 20 (some pros will tell you to eliminate sharpness, however, I find that a little bit actually helps with clarity, just not too much). We only changed one color and that was blue (this has to be done with almost all led sets since predominantly blue). We set black levels to \"darkest\", dynamic contrast to \"low\". We left cinema black alone, since we were unable to identify any differences with it on or off. We also set dynamic backlighting to \"high\" since this also improved contrast and black levels during dark scenes, but standard also does just fine. The black checker-board was almost 100% reproduced with dark blacks and whitest whites and no uneven light. The end result is basically a perfectly calibrated set, almost 100% color accuracy. Can't ask much more then that if you ask me.All in all, the best LED TV set I've reviewed. We've been messing with the F8500 Plasma, which I believe, along with the Panasonic VT60 to be among the best/ most accurate picture available until 4K and OLED become mainstream. However, this LED set still comes pretty close to the image quality of the top plasma's today. I still recommend the Plasma's over the LED's hoever because they have much faster refresh rates and smoother motion, especially in movie scenes and video games.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable!!", "Author": "K. Coste", "ReviewID": "R1168H8IT1ZLPF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a professional video producer who is seldom truly impressed. My previous TV was a Panasonic 50 inch plasma, which was working perfectly, and I had been waiting and watching the industry for when I should jump to the next level. This, among other choices, including new plasmas, was it. Pricey, but some things in life are worth it.Out of the box, I was not happy at all, and it turns out there are a multitude of factory settings that need adjustment. The biggest culprit was something called Auto Motion Plus, which Samsung should never have made the factory default, and should be turned off forever. It was designed as an aid to fast moving action scenes utilizing the high refresh rate, but it turns a stunningly beautiful movie into a soap opera video. The rest are a matter of personal taste, as in color balances, contrast, saturation, black levels, etc. I keep the Cinema Black off, as this unit does a great job with the blacks in other areas of the menu. Skin tones are the true test.Off axis viewing is less than ideal, and there is some edge light visible at times on dark scenes, but I continue to be stunned by the image, especially the 3D, which is mesmerizing, super-vivid and hyper-real.There are those who are saying 3D is a fad that will pass, but they are dead wrong, and obviously have NOT seen the likes of this TV in a dark space. 3D is no more a fad than experiencing life with two eyes rather than one. I would add though, that for 3D to be effective, the screen must be large, as it can be a little like looking through a window if too small.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Overall Television but not Perfect", "Author": "D. Hayes", "ReviewID": "R3KN2P72LYQW48", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this television for several weeks now and first and foremost I'll say that the picture quality is outstanding. It's pretty much the best LCD television you can buy this year. For those deciding between this or the 8500 Plasma, the LCD is better in a wider range of viewing situations (such as lots of ambient light, many windows, rooms that are sunny) due to the brighter image but if you're purchasing for a basement or dark media room then the 8500 will easily win over this unit.Picture Quality:As so many people have already mentioned the picture quality I won't say much. I'd recommend enabling CAL Day/Night modes and calibrate based on those rather than just using standard or dynamic. You can find some excellent calibration settings online if you don't want to pay to have your unit custom calibrated. Content looks fantastic, colors are very accurate and black levels are great. You may notice some odd dimming of the screen on dark scenes such as a dark scene on a black road with just a car's tail lamps trailing away. The television senses that the scene is mostly black and dims the backlight down to make the picture look as black as possible. It also means that the one area of the image that is supposed to be bright gets dimmed as well. This is pretty much a trade-off because the alternative would likely be flashlighting/halos around the bright part of the image or significantly less deep blacks. You can adjust the intensity of this with the Smart LED controls but at the very least you should probably leave it on low so you get the picture quality improvements.I've tried a few 3D movies and games and have enjoyed them very much though I don't find the glasses that comfortable. They aren't incredibly heavy but I was certainly ready to take them off after a two hour movie. Brightness in 3D mode is very good and I experienced very few issues with ghosting.The one real downside to the picture quality is viewing angles and this may be very important depending on where you place your television. Picture quality is awesome when you're sitting in front of the screen but if you're off center, in any direction, the picture quality drops from fantastic to just good. I have mine sitting on a television stand and there's a noticeable drop in quality between viewing the screen while sitting on my couch (eye level) and viewing the screen while standing (below eye level). The black levels aren't as great and the image looks a little more washed out. I mention this because it seems fairly common for people to place their televisions above fireplaces as many rooms are designed with the fireplace in the center of a wall rather than off into a corner. If you are placing this television above a fireplace and will sit below it you absolutely must get a mount that allows you to tilt the screen down toward the viewing area or else you'll miss out on the fantastic picture quality.Design:The overall objective design of the television is fantastic. The stand, subjectively, is also fantastic but some may not like it as it's more a matter of personal preference. The bezel is incredibly small making the front of the screen look nearly edge to edge. It also means the television is physically smaller. It's actually smaller than the 50\" plasma it replaces because the bulk of the bezel has been removed. The entire unit is incredibly thin and only has a marginally larger part near the bottom where most of the internals are housed. This also means that things like A/V and component cables require adapters as they've tried to minimize wasted space. The adapters essentially look like an aux/headphone jack on one end and the a/v or composite connections on the other and are included with the set. I've had no problems using them and quality does not appear to suffer as a result of their use.Back to the stand, it is true that the stand is large. Many people claim that the stand is the same width of the television but it is in fact slightly smaller than the screen (at least for the 55\") model. I was under the impression that I'd have to replace my television stand as it would have been about a half inch over each side (I was worried about the screen tipping forward) but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the stand actually fits. Amazon quotes the width as  48.2\" with the stand but the stand itself is just shy of 47\" at its widest point (on the 55\" model). It may not seem like a huge difference but it was very important in my case. Additionally, the stand keeps the television tilted slightly rearward. You can't notice the tilt while watching but if you stare at the screen from the side you may notice. My guess is that this is done to help lower the tipping risk since most people won't anchor it.It's a beautiful television and I've found myself looking at it when a walk into my living room, even when it isn't on, just to admire it.Smart Features:This television is packed with extra features beyond just the quality of the screen and this is where it becomes sort of a mixed-bag. It's absolutely great that they include them but some don't work as well as one would hope and are obviously first attempts at what may become awesome later on. I've run into zero problems with the apps thus far (such as Netflix, Amazon, HBO, Camera and the browser). They all work well and using them is fairly straight forward. I've also had no problem playing mp4 files from usb drives plugged into the back of the screen. I've yet to try out things like Twitter or Facebook because I don't really see the point of including them on a television. It's far easier to just reach into your pocket for a phone or grab a computer than to deal with such features on your television. However as a tivo user I greatly appreciate the TWC TV app that allows me to access on demand content straight from the TV since I don't have a Time Warner box.There are several ways to control the television and this is where the television really feels like a first generation product. Firstly there is the remote which I will discuss below but there is also the ability to control the television with gestures and with your voice. The gestures are interesting in the sense that basic tasks can be completed simply by raising your hand. In order for them to work however you need to be in a well lit room and take care to pay close attention to what you are doing. I've had several times where the television would select and item (normally by closing your hand) instead of swiping a screen (normally a sort of wave like motion) because I moved too quickly. It can also be a little frustrating to hone in on certain smaller items because as you hover over them the television will initially track your closing hand as movement and thus move the cursor before you're able to select. Additionally they don't work universally across the television. You can use hand gestures to launch the Netflix app but you'll have to pick up a remote to actually navigate inside the app. It's a neat concept but in the end it's probably easier to grab a remote for most tasks.Then there are voice commands, the one I have the largest problem with. Primarily it's clunky, awkward and slow. It's never going to feel natural saying \"Hi TV\" and waiting for it to pick up your voice to activate voice control. There is a processing delay so you have to say it and wait for the on screen prompt to tell you that you can proceed. While it seems to do a great job of understanding me, you are required to use very specific wording. For example, if I want to turn my television off I must first say \"Hi TV\", wait a couple of seconds, say \"TV power off\", wait for it to recognize the speech and then ask me \"Would you like to turn the TV off?\". Then you must confirm with either \"OK\" or \"Cancel\". At which point it then takes several seconds to actually complete the command. You have to say \"OK\". Saying \"Yes\" yields no results or makes it think I've said cancel. If you use the microphone on the remote it seems to respond a bit faster but the vocabulary is still limited.I've also run into a problem where the voice command is activated at random times. It's only happened when using Netflix but if I rewind it happens at the same spot. Essentially you'll be watching something and then it will suddenly mute the audio and bring up the voice command overlay. It doesn't seem to activate the ambient microphone so I need to press voice on the remote and say \"cancel\" to make it go away. It's happened enough where I've had to turn off voice commands completely though I don't feel like I'm missing out on much as I would not have used them otherwise.The Remote:The remote is equal parts awesome and terrible. It's small, very high quality and the touchpad feature is essential to navigating the Smart Hub and using the browser. However, it's also very limited in its buttons/functions. Many common tasks are hidden in an on screen remote since there are so few buttons on the actual remote. To do things like enter numbers, jump to Netflix, activate game mode, turn on the external speakers, play/pause/FF/RWD, etc. you have to press \"More\" on the remote and then scroll between one of three on screen remotes to find the command you want. It gets old pretty quickly. I ended up ordering a second, full size remote because I just use the missing buttons far too often.Additionally there are some design issues with the remote. While the touchpad is great, it often feels jumpy when using and you can't really tell if swiping your finger left/right or up/down will move the cursor to the next item or skip down two or three. They've also placed the \"Recommended\" and \"Search\" buttons ON the touchpad at the bottom. The touchpad really isn't large enough to have this button and on several occasions while scrolling around the on screen keyboard or using the browser I've pressed recommended search by accident. This clears out the keyboard and all of the inputs you've added thus far and brings up another menu.Finally, the backlight on the remote is useless as it only illuminates the buttons and not the labels. You'll need to study the remote to memorize what you're looking at in darkness with the backlight.In the end the remote is cool but was frustrating enough to require a second remote for normal use.Etc:The built in speakers are acceptable, especially considering how thin the television is, but they aren't awesome. They're perfectly find for normal television watching but I also use a home theater system with it for movies or just when I want higher quality sound.It's nice that you can play videos, music and images from directly attached hard drives and usb drives as well as networked computers but I was a little disappointed to discover that the TV can't see the hard drive connected to my router. I have a lot of stuff stored there so it can be access by multiple devices without having to turn my desktop on but from what I can tell thus far I can only access content stored on my computer, not the networked drive. I'll have to keep playing around with it to see if I can get that to change. Additionally, it requires you register with Samsung and download software in order to work which is a bit annoying. I'd rather the television just detect what's being shared on the network automatically without the need of additional software on my computers.It may seem like I have a lot of small complaints and thus does not make sense I rated it 5 stars but it keeps its five star rating because as a television it's brilliant. The smart features are secondary, in my opinion, and having to get another remote wasn't enough to knock it down a full star. It truly is an excellent television. You'll just simply have to learn how to get around or deal with some of the minor annoyances that pop up with the extra features that are built in. If you aren't likely to use such things then all of those annoyances are irrelevant. For overall satisfaction and quality, this television is definitely a winner.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "SmartHub DROPS SIGNAL + TV Requires Manual SW Updates!", "Author": "Michelle Petty", "ReviewID": "R1V9Q5L85BZ0G3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Before buying this TV, I read all the reviews on Amazon. I also conducted my own research online, comparing a number of Smart TVs on the market. While I'm happy with the basic functionality of the television, I'm quite disappointed with \"smart\" part of the TV. What the reviews and research didn't tell me was the following:BIGGEST ISSUES:1. SMARTHUB DROPS WIFI SIGNAL EVERY 5-15 MINUTES, so if you're trying to use the SmartHub to watch Amazon Instant Videos, for instance, your frustration level will likely build to a point that you'll want to take a sledgehammer to the television (no joke!). Every time the signal drops, which can be every 5 minutes or every 15 minutes, you have to reset the network on the television, including waiting for the television to recognize your WiFi and then reentering your password. There are numerous  Internet forums, articles, and discussions on this issues. Simply type in \"Samsung television drops internet connection\" to find/read them. As these articles, etc., explain (and I can attest), it is not a signal strength problem; therefore, moving your router closer to the tv and/or adding a signal booster is useless. You will continue to experience this problem. In fact, Samsung is aware of the issue and recently released a software update to address it ... but the update doesn't work! The problem persists. And that brings me to my second issue ...2. SOFTWARE/FIRMWARE UPDATES ARE MANUAL. I didn't even know there software/firmware updates until I was trying to fix the above-referenced issue! Now that I know they exist (and are a pain to deal with!), I have to remind myself to check for the updates, since Samsung doesn't notify me that they've been issued. In addition, the website has some errors, so if you look for the update on one screen it doesn't exist, but if you manually search for your television model, the update shows up.3. ALLSHARE IS LIMITED. My example is related to viewing photos. I assumed I would be able to view all the photos from my computer, but that is not the case. AllShare only allows you to view a limited number of folders (I believe it's 9,  but I can't remember). And then, each folder can only have a limited number of files. And on top of these issues, it often takes a while for the photos to load ... and to get from one photo to the next. These limitations, and other similar limitations, render the AllShare \"feature\" virtually useless for me.OTHER ISSUES:1.  CAMERA IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO USE B/C OF ITS LOCATION. We have a 60\" television and a relatively small living room. Because the camera is located on top of the television, we have to back up into the kitchen in order to even try to use the camera.2. VOICE RECOGNITION LAUNCHES RANDOMLY. This is a minor frustration, but a design flaw nonetheless.At the end of the day, I wonder how smart I was to buy such a \"smart\" television at such a hefty price tag, when a regular television and an Apple TV (or similar) offer many of the same results at a substantially lower cost.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wall Mounting Information", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2HDR9URQXQEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the TV and all the positive comments by others are accurate.

Several TV purchases & comparisons later I'm finally Happy!", "Author": "Brandy.A.", "ReviewID": "R1ER96WJRJSO69", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a very happy Lady! I just had to write this review, hoping it helps someone else make a decision that might be struggling like I was with picking a TV.  I'm a bit picky.  I mean, I figure if I'm going to spend $$$$ for a TV, I had better be picky.  Right?  I'm also a tech geek and I know what to look for in TV.  I had went through several TV's before buying this Gorgeous Samsung UN60F8000.  I'll start with the comparisons before ending with my review of the Samsung.First, I had purchased the Vizio 60\" MD10d this years current model.  I was hoping to save money and still get a good TV.  The TV was nice, a little thicker than most of the new ones for this year.  3D was great but that is where it ends.  Bad Flash-lighting, and a few light bleed issues, software glitches and the TV freezing up due to the Yahoo and YouTube apps, no power buttons on the Vizio at all, and the only way to fix the problem is unplug it from the wall and restart.  Vizio had no real solution.  The Apps are there, but they are small widget windows on the left side of the screen and with the Amazon app, search is awful and you can't access your watch list.  Needless to say, the Vizio was returned back to Amazon.Next, I purchased an LG 55LA7400, this years current model.  Beautiful TV, Slim, Stylish.  Great interface, but several Flaws.  I immediately got the impression that LG had downgraded their quality control department.  I had 2 red stuck pixels, severe clouding on the screen in right and bottom left areas of screen.  Banding that was really distracting the picture itself.  Again, I was disappointed.  Especially, since I have had LG TV's and loved them in the past.  My Mother had purchased last years model, and was very happy with it.  Great TV, made in Canada.  This year,  they are made in Mexico.  At least the two LG's I received were.  I also got a 47 LA7400 for the bedroom at the same time I bought the 55'.  Opened it up got it set up, and immediately at the bottom left of the screen a big jagged line of black and white pixels.  I would estimate 100+ of them.  This is unacceptable!  I had to call Amazon again.  Two LG's returned in one day!  It's not Amazon's fault.  It's the quality control of LG.  I read several forums and as it turns out many have had this issue with LG this year.  It's a hit or miss if you get lucky enough to get a good one.  I went to Best Buy,  determined to get an LG since I wanted to save money but still have a good TV with 3D.  Got another 55\".  Again,  same issues.  Stuck pixels and clouding.  Went back for an exchange.  This time, only one stuck red pixel and minimal clouding.I had hit rock bottom.  After taking a couple of days to think it over and getting my husband to agree,  I decided to go ahead and spend more money to get that \"perfect\" TV.  I bought the Samsung 60\" UN60F8000 from Amazon.  All I can say is, \"OMG\".  I honestly was so thrilled with my purchase I was nearly speechless with awe.  The packaging was great. It felt like Christmas.  You can tell the quality control was there.  Even the QC's name was on some of the packaging, assuring you it was inspected for quality and passed.  The setup even better.  The stand, solid metal.  Sturdy and gorgeous. It's designed to make the TV look as if it's just floating in mid air.  The TV, the thinnest I have seen.  The bezel even thinner!  I plugged it in and crossed my fingers, praying.  Power On.  WOW!  Perfect screen...flawless! No clouding, no flash-lighting, no dead or stuck pixels, no banding.  Just PERFECT.  The way a TV should be.  I immediately tried the 3D.  Again, perfect!  I tried the Apps, Amazon Instant, HBOGO, SHO, Vudu, YouTube, Pandora, Crackle just to name a few.  It does have Hulu and Netflix.  Interestingly, there are also Fitness/Workout and Yoga Apps and plenty of free educational apps and 3D documentaries for kids.  All work excellent and the interfaces for those Apps are nice and simple.The Samsung app store offers tons of free Apps unlike LG which costs $. There is a lot of 3D content (way more than LG or Vizio) that will keep you entertained for hours. Great for kids!  You will never get bored with this TV. Voice Control works great.  The Web browser is snappy with a very well thought out in design.  Motion control is good, will take a little learning though. Think of Xbox motion control and you will get the idea.  The built in camera is sharp and clear.  Excellent Skype app!  I LOVE the remote.  Those of you that have an iPad, or use any device with a trackpad, will immediately feel comfortable with the remote.  I actually prefer it over the LG Magic remote.  The Samsung is also fast with a snappy response.  Apps are almost instant,  Boot up of TV is extremely fast.  Ease of use is a huge plus.  Set up was the easiest of the TV's I had tried.  Interface is clean and simple, but gorgeous in soothing colors of blue.  The TV came calibrated right out of the box and I've had to make minimal adjustments. Unlike the Vizio and LG, which took a while to get the colors and picture right and not as \"pixelated\".The Samsung has the best picture of them all.  Incredibly life like, it will leave you breathless.  The quality difference to me was night and day.  You certainly get your money's worth.  I had read reviews at CNET and LDCTvBuyingGuide dot com.  One had stated they felt Samsung was practically giving away a 4K Ultra TV in this model.  The picture is that good!  I have to agree.  I have found no motion issues or glitches with mine.  For any one that does,  simply turn off the Auto Motion Plus feature.  You only should have it on if you are watching sports or really fast action scenes.  I have watched a few movies with fast action and have noticed absolutely zero judder or blur.  The LG and Vizio simply couldn't match up in this department.  For gaming,  I have noticed minimal lag if any at all which is far better than the LG which lags horribly.  The 3D glasses each come in a protective sleeve.  They are very lightweight and comfortable.  I really like them.  In the end,  if you are willing to spend the extra $,  you can't go wrong with Samsung.  This is my first Samsung TV and I found a winner and they've earned a loyal customer provided they keep up the quality in the future models.  I was so happy, I went and purchased the Samsung 46\" UN46F7100 for the bedroom.  Again, a perfect TV!  It had a little flash-lighting in a corner.  All I did was loosen a screw on the back of the TV in that corner and problem solved.  Couldn't be happier!  I could go on and on about this TV, but I won't or I will be here all day.

I don't want to repeat everyone and write a 2000 word review just to get a free gift from amazon. So, I want to be to the point.TV:Picture quality is amazing including 3D. Product appearance is by far the most appealing compared to other brands. Speakers quality is actually really nice (my TV hangs on the wall, so the sound bounces back to the room) and loud enough. Don't fall into the sales pitch - sound bar is not needed. I always say, want a good movie experience, go to the movie theater.Now the frustrating part:Whenever I'm using smart TV app (netflix, youtube, hulu and etc), the TV remote functionality is not constant, one minute work fine, another - you need to make sure the remote is in the direct line of sight and close to the TV's infrared sensor. Really frustrating having to get up and seems like it never works when you need it (pause, play, volume buttons). All of this works fine when you are watching videos from external device (usb flash, media players)Just noticed another day that wi-fi is very slow. I'm using a comcast blast internet (50 mbps). When watching netflix, video is almost never HD (10% of the time), not even digital - blurry and sometimes needs to reload constantly. So, I've decided to try watching netflix through a gaming console (PS3), what a difference. Never knew that my TV picture quality is so great while watching netflix. Fell in love with my TV again. Remote works fine (meaning, you can point anywhere to change the volume level), video loads in 1 sec and 100% 1080p HD quality. So, this tells me that SmartHub is not so smart.SmartHub constantly updates (about once a week) so you can't use it for about 10 minutes (this is livable, and any software should update - but it's getting on my nerves to deal with it once a week).So, to sum up - TV is great, SmartHub not so. I stopped using it. My point is, I bought this TV for the smart feature, so I get rid of external devices and wires, and it turns out to be just a great screen.I don't recommend this TV if you are looking for great smart experience (same exact problem as with the 2012 samsung smart TV's).

Clients immediately comment on how sharp it is and I have the setting very very low (15?).

Clients also note this. So, design is A+, picture dead on is B (compared to my previous A+ Panasonic VT50). Picture off-angle? See next section. Spoiler: it sucks bigtime.How the panel sucks: My 80\" wide couch is positioned about 9 feet away (head-to-screen distance). At this distance, viewers on either extreme of the couch (about 20 degrees off center viewing angle) see noticeable picture deterioration in terms of contrast (most noticeable) and color loss (less noticeable but becomes very noticeable the more you go out). The deterioration is confined to the farthest side of the panel while closer content is normal. I notice this immediately because I do color correction for photography. Clients don't immediately notice it and aren't as picky as I. But, for this price, it's a very big drawback considering the rest of the panel. Other issues are uneven backlighting (side-lit zones aren't uniform), wavy uneven brightness off-angle (normal to edge-lit LCD), extremely wide stand, remote that has so much potential but is handicapped by shortsightedness and bad design.

Plusses and minuses to both, and everyone with their own opinion on which is best. My previous TV was a Samsung LCD, so that\u2019s all I knew. Because of my very positive experience with that TV, I wanted another Samsung, and I wanted the biggest TV possible that would fit my entertainment center. That gave me a choice between the PN60F8500 (plasma) and the UN65F8000 (LED). The LED was slightly more expensive because it was 5 inches bigger. Even comparing the same 60\u201d models, the plasma was slightly less. At the time, more reviews could be found on the plasma than the LED, and they all raved that it was one of the best TVs since the Kuro. So I went with the PN60F8500, and my review can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R361IQ3MSROPA9/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R361IQ3MSROPA9I was very critical of that TV, despite it having great picture quality, and I ultimately returned it. There are a lot of people that love that TV, and you may too if you decide to purchase it. It just wasn\u2019t for me. That now brings me to the UN65F8000. I\u2019ll try to touch on as many aspects of the TV as possible from my own personal experience, starting even before turning it on. If I miss something you\u2019re curious about, feel free to leave a comment, and I\u2019ll respond.Shipping:I always recommend you go with the \u201cwhite glove\u201d delivery if available. It really just means that someone will bring it into your home, unpack it, and plug it in before leaving, instead of just leaving it at your doorstep. In my case, the first TV that came, when it was turned on, the screen was busted. I was able to refuse the shipment, they repacked it, and took it away. Meanwhile the next order was being placed, and on the way. Between returning the PN60F8500, and then getting the busted UN65F8000, it was quite the lengthy process to actually get the TV that now sits in my living room, but customer service was always excellent, and they helped expedite the process as much as they could.Styling:Without turning on the screen, this is a TV that just looks nice. It doesn\u2019t overwhelm you with accents. It\u2019s minimalistic, small frame, a nice touch of chrome, and barely a bezel. There\u2019s a very small Samsung logo at the bottom middle that will be lit by default, but can also be always off, or only on when the TV is off. Those settings can be found in Menu>System>General>Light Effect. I prefer it to only be on while \u201cIn Standby\u201d so that it\u2019s not distracting while watching TV, but you still have the nice light when the TV is off. In my case, I use the stand, and it first wasn\u2019t sure if the TV was sturdy enough, but there have been zero issues, and it does what it\u2019s supposed to \u2013 hold the TV upright. I\u2019m sure if you wanted to put this TV on a wall, it would look great too.Picture Quality:Out of the box, the UN65F8000 has great picture quality. My couch is a little on the close side for the recommended viewing distance. I\u2019m only about 7-7.5 feet away. For a 65 inch TV, most of what I read said 8.5 feet, but have also seen 6.5 - 10.3. If you\u2019re upgrading from a smaller TV (in my case, 52\u201d), then there may be a little shock factor in the beginning. Everything is amplified on a bigger TV. Meaning if you took the F8000 and compared the 65\u201d to the 46\u201d you\u2019ll likely see some pixilation, motion blur, etc, that would not be seen in the same version of the TV, but smaller. That being said, the UN65F8000 is crystal clear. It is best when watching blurays or other video that is 1080P, and when the frame rates are higher. If you\u2019re watching a DVD, you won\u2019t be getting the full experience. For an LED, this TV has fantastic black levels, even without some of the additional settings turned on. Whether you\u2019re watching sports, news, reality TV, or playing video games, the TV performs well. Also, because of how the TV is styled, all you notice when the TV is on is the picture on the screen. No distractions, just a picture that practically floats in the air.Picture Settings:How you choose to do your settings is personal preference. There are a lot of forums that will offer up full settings so you can copy what they did, but the reality is that a TV will look different based on the room that it is in because of the light conditions, and possibly the colors in that room. I\u2019ll list some of the settings I feel helped improve my viewing experience below, but I highly recommend you play around with various settings on your own to find what appeals to your eye the most. Some of these may be default, but I can\u2019t remember what default was and what wasn\u2019t--Picture Mode Standard-Backlight 15-Contrast 80-Brightness 48-Sharpness 25-Color 50Advanced-Dynamic Contrast Off-Black Tone Off-Motion Lighting OffPicture Options-Color Tone Standard-Digital Clean View Auto-MPEG Noise Filter AutoAuto Motion Plus Custom  -Blur Reduction 10  -Judder Reduction 5  -LED Clear Motion On-Smart LED High-Cinema Black OnSound:I would suspect that most people buying this TV also have surround sound or at least a sound bar, so there are only a few things I\u2019ll say about the sound. If you are using the TV speakers for your primary sound, it\u2019s actually not too bad. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it personally, but for TV speakers, they do alright. It\u2019s too bad TV manufacturers don\u2019t just do away with the speakers though. Anyway, the main thing I want to point out about the sound is regarding the output to a receiver/surround sound system. Older TVs would allow you to run your various video/audio sources through your TV, and out via an optical audio cable. For example, DirecTV and PS3 hooked up with an HDMI to the TV, then an optical cable from the TV to the receiver for the sound. This was a nice way of doing it so that you wouldn\u2019t have to change the receiver to another input. You can still do this with new TVs, but you won\u2019t be getting greater than 2.1 surround anymore. Apparently, this isn\u2019t just a Samsung thing. There\u2019s some stupid law that says that you can only output greater than 2.1 directly from the audio source. I read about it when I noticed I wasn\u2019t getting full surround sound from the new TV. It will try to compress a 5.1 audio down to 2.1, and it doesn\u2019t do a great job. You\u2019ll end up missing out on a channel or two sometimes. The fix is just to run it all through the receiver instead of the TV. That being said, if the TV is \u201cthe source\u201d (ie. Smart Hub apps like Netflix), then you will still get 5.1 with optical out. Otherwise, I suggest you do not run any audio through the TV. I like great sound almost as much as I do great picture, so this was a must for me. To try to be clear, and give an example \u2013 You have your Cable/Satellite box, take an HDMI cable and plug that into your receiver, and then another HDMI cable from your receiver to your TV \u2013 OR \u2013 From the Cable/Satellite box take an HDMI cable and plug that into your TV, and then take an optical or digital audio cable and plug that into the receiver (from the Cable/Satellite box, not the TV). The only time you should be using the audio out from the TV is for when you\u2019re using the SmartHub Apps. I hope that all makes sense\u2026Network:The UN65F8000 allows for a wired Ethernet connection or WiFI. I personally use the wired connection, but the WiFI works well too. I\u2019ve only done minimal testing with the WiFI, and my router is not far from the TV, so I cannot comment on range. The wired connection works well, as it should.SmartHub:The SmartHub is great, and has a ton of apps. The ones I use \u2013 Netflix, Amazon, HBOGo, MLB.tv, Spotify, YouTube and MGo. It\u2019s easily accessible from the Samsung remote, and replaces most needs of having another device like an AppleTV or Roku.Guide:It is possible to use Samsung IR blasters to control your cable/satellite box, and if you are set on using the voice control features, then you might like this feature. However, I find the Samsung guide to be insufficient, and does not allow you to control your cable/satellite box with the same capabilities as the normal cable/satellite remotes. When setting up your TV, it will ask you what provider you use so that it can populate the guide. Since this guide is separate from the box, certain features like setting a recording, or bringing up a list of recorded shows - which I think for most people, if you have a cable/satellite box, you probably have a DVR too. So for me, I don\u2019t use the IR blasters or the Samsung Guide. If you\u2019re like me, then here\u2019s a helpful tip I picked up somewhere else: When you\u2019re setting up the TV (or you can change this from settings), do not select a cable/satellite provider. Instead select antenna. This way, when you hit the SmartHub button, it will open directly to the apps instead of the guide. If you are not like me, and want the Samsung guide, then another tip is that you can also choose a setting to open the guide when the TV turns on. All of these settings should be found under Smart Features when you hit Menu on the TV remote, or by going to System>Setup.Voice Recognition:In general, I\u2019m not a fan of most voice recognition technology. Think about the experience you have when you make a call to a 800 number, and have to say what you want before getting to a live person, and it misunderstands you multiple times, so you just keep saying, \u201cRepresentative, Representative, Representative!!!\u201d Well, same applies to trying to control your TV that way. So I just turn this setting off. It sounds cool in theory, and looks cool in commercials, but it\u2019s just not quite there yet. Plus if you\u2019re not using the IR blasters to control the TV, there\u2019s very little to control with your voice. The voice control can sometimes pick up on words/noise in the room, and think you\u2019re trying to give a command, when you\u2019re not. If you would like to turn it off, the setting is under Smart Features after pressing Menu on the remote. (Side note \u2013 Google Now\u2019s Voice Recognition is actually really good, but that doesn\u2019t apply to this TV review)Camera:The camera is decent, and if you Skype, could be a cool way for you to do it. The camera is a pop up camera at the top center. It is a manual pop up. You have to press it in. Same to hide it as well. There is a small roller on the top that will adjust the angle, but it doesn\u2019t allow for a very big variance up and down. For me, the camera wouldn\u2019t angle down enough to see much of except the top of my head. I don\u2019t have much use for the camera, so I leave it down. Plus, after getting an Xbox One, I needed somewhere to put the Kinect. I found that the Kinect will balance nicely at the top of the TV without the need for a bracket because of where the camera recedes into the TV, creating a small area for the Kinect to sit on. And if you do have a Kinect, then you\u2019ll probably want to Skype or whatever from that camera instead anyway.Motion Control:Motion actually works pretty well, but I still think remotes are easier to use. So I turned it off. This is also under Smart Features. If you do want this feature on, then the camera has to be up. If the camera is down, and the feature is on, you\u2019ll get notes on the screen every time you turn on the TV about how the camera needs to be up for motion control.Remotes:There are 2 remotes. You don\u2019t actually need 2, but they are both very different, and I like one and not the other. First, the one I like \u2013 It\u2019s very similar to the remote Samsung has been using for years. Long, black, the usual buttons for everything, plus a SmartHub button, Netflix button, and Amazon button. If you use Netflix or Amazon a lot, these buttons are awesome! I\u2019m a fan. Not much else to say about this remote because it works just like a remote should. The 2nd remote, however, in my opinion, is not very good at all. They call it the Smart Touch Remote, and there is a HUGE learning curve to use this remote. There are only a few actual buttons, no numbers, and uses a touchpad for most of the controls. It\u2019s incredibly difficult in comparison to the other remote. Needless to say, I do not use the Smart Touch Remote, and would not recommend it. One thing to note if you\u2019re considering the PNxxF8500 (the plasma I mentioned earlier) \u2013 for that TV, it\u2019s the only remote that comes with the TV, which would be very frustrating to have to use. I hope that Samsung will continue to provide the normal remotes for future TV models. Whatever the case may be, I\u2019d also recommend you consider the Logitech Harmony Ultimate. I got one as a gift recently, and it\u2019s fantastic, making all of my equipment work together just a little bit easier.Other Settings:Under System, there are some other settings you might consider-  -Eco Solution \u2013 I\u2019ve gone back and forth on these settings. I currently am only using the Eco Sensor setting, and set the min backlight to 10 since you may not need the screen as bright in a dark room compared to when the lights are on.  -General \u2013 I turn the boot logo off. It just what show the Samsung SmartTV boot screen. Not sure this saves any time booting, but just felt I didn\u2019t need to see the boot logo everytime. I also mentioned earlier I changed the Light Effect to \u201cIn Standby\u201d which is the lighted Samsung logo at the bottom of the screen.  -Auto Update \u2013 This is found under Support>Software Update. I have it on, but I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s been updating automatically because I recently did an update by manually pressing update now, and it skipped over a couple of software versions. Whatever the case may be, the software updates do bring nice updates to the TV, whether it be settings, function, SmartHub, or something else.3D:The TV does a pretty good job with 3D. Unfortunately, there\u2019s just not a ton of good content. I mentioned earlier that I sit about 7-7.5 feet away from the TV, which for 3D on this TV, I think is too close. You probably need to be at least 10 feet away for better 3D viewing.Overall:I\u2019ve been very pleased with the UN65F8000, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a top of the line LED TV with great picture. I\u2019ve had the TV for about 6 months now. I\u2019ve had a Super Bowl party, movie nights, played plenty of video games, and streamed plenty of video, and the TV has not disappointed. If all goes well, this will be my TV until 4K gets cheaper and has more content. Keep your eye out for a good deal on this TV.

I have not had to make any changes to video settings or do any calibration tweaks. The picture quality is still the best I've seen on an 1080p LED panel. I still feel like it was the best choice to go with this model over Samsung's 4K model. That was another factor in play when making the choice between TV's but as content for 4K isn't really there yet I stuck with regular 1080p.The TV's black levels still continue to amaze me and motion blur is at a bare minimum. Brightness has also continued to impress me as again, we have full windows with lots of natural sunlight to compete with if our blackouts aren't drawn during the day. Little to no glare on screen as well.I know this isn't anything I haven't said in my original post, but time has proven it even further.+Original+A few months ago we finished off our basement. I began the search for a TV that could be used in the theater I had planned to put in. We have windows that get a lot of natural sunlight where the theater space is so I needed something that could compete with the sunlight for my wife during the day but looked incredible in dimmed / dark conditions for movies as well in the evenings. After countless hours of research I settled on this TV (UN65F8000) and I can assure you that this TV does NOT disappoint. It can handle all types of environments and so far has been flawless.I've used this TV for over 2 months now and each time I walk into the room with a live sporting event or movie playing, I do a double take as the TV still amazes me.  It is probably single handedly the best LED TV I've ever seen. Having a crisp, razor sharp detailed image was very important to me when making my choice's about what items to buy for the theater. Nothing is worse then motion blur and \"grey\" blacks. I was worried that with the 65 inch screen size that there would be blur lines and motion clarity lost. I was corrected very quickly after I watched my first baseball game. Looking at textures in 1080 is incredible. The level of black detail this TV is able to reproduce puts it up there with some of the best plasma's w/o all the headache of how a plasma can interfere with your set up.VERY IMPORTANT:Samsung \"out of the box\" picture settings are HORRIBLE. I used the CNET settings to achieve the best picture possible.Those can be found here: [...]Secondly there was a very annoying message that would pop up in-between selecting video sources via the HDMI cable. After some research the fix was easy - Go into the settings on the TV and locate the \"Universal Remote\" option. Remove any component options it has listed and the problem will go away. Very simple fix for an extremely frustrating problem.I won't go on and on but I could - the bottom line is if your willing to spend the amount of money this TV cost, you will not regret it.Happy TV hunting.

I've tried contacting Samsung 3 separate times and their only recommendation is to just use an ethernet cable.

It was time to upgrade my existing LN-4695-D Samsung 46\" model from 6 years ago. Technology has come a long way since and I did extensive research on the new TVs and this model seemed the most promising one and in-store picture was good (though hard to tell).One has to assemble the stand (no big problem there) and the TV itself is pretty light (very thin). It has a nice stand but it is not a swivel stand so this may be an issue for some people.I didn't buy the TV for the smart features. I didn't even bother with voice/motion activation or the like. Having a camera with Skype can be handy at times but I don't make any usage of the smart features - I bought the TV for its picture quality and its ability to connect to Amazon/Netflix for streaming (previously that was done through the DVD and was quite slow).The TV start time is pretty good and its ability to connect to Netflix and download streaming is significantly faster than my older Samsung home theater system (which I no longer have to power up).I initially was disappointed with black levels as when the menu appeared it was the \"usual\" dark gray that was in my earlier TV. However, once watching a movie or playing the xbox, this disappeared and I could see a great difference between this TV and my older ones. Black looks very black now and the image is very sharp.I also tried watching a 3d movie. I didn't expect much but after putting the glasses - OMG!!! Imax like. Images are popping out of the screen. Amazing!Pro:===* excellent picture quality* fast start up time and Netflix/Amazon streaming connection/buffering* easy to follow TV configuration setup* very thin bezel (screen frame\") - reduces overall TV size and weight and makes its appearance more appealing.* I paid around $1,770 grand total for this TV from Amazon (Black Friday). I don't consider this inexpensive but for what you get, a top of the line TV, I think it is a very good bang for the buck.Cons:====* one has to assemble the TV to the stand (not a problem for me but might be for some).* cables are no longer connected to port in a 90 degree angle. They are inserted sideways which is kind of hard sometimes. Perhaps this was done to keep a slimmer profile.* if you don't have a TV stand which can support 46\" stand you can't put your TV on it. It is not a small swivel stand but a static one.* When turning the TV on and the last input device is off (or turned off) the TV alerts you about it (kind of annoying) instead of just going to a different input or showing the main menu and input devices.* I myself don't like the smart features - rather have a dumb TV which just knows how to connect to Netflix/Amazon and show a picture.

The picture quality is absolutely amazing short of 4K. I was between purchasing a 4K 65 inch TV and this 75 inch 1080p LED TV. 4K has not been perfected or optimized as of yet and there are limited things that you can watch on 4K. Plus the price is a little out of my range (25 - 30K for 84-85 inch TVs).This is the best possible 1080p TV you can purchase with a size that is perfect for my one bedroom apartment. Anything bigger would not fit in my apt, and you wouldn't be able to see the whole screen without looking right, left, up, down, etc from the distance I'm watching at.

The smart capabilities are way improved also. I've received many many compliments from visitors and some smirks of jealousy.Of course no product is perfect because everyone has different preferences.Three things that I find annoying:1) Volume control increment - the increments are too small. The perceptible volume difference between volume setting 30 and 40 is hardly perceptible for some movies. Maybe there is a way to change this, but I have not yet researched on how to do this. Laziness on my part, I admit. Also you can't adjust the volume when there's nothing playing on the screen. Ex: browsing through the smart TV feature for videos, can't adjust the volume until something is playing (Minor criticism).2) Smart TV controller - Takes a little while to get used to. A little cumbersome at times.3) Default settings are pretty terrible for watching sports broadcasted by cable companies. Someone on amazon in the past has posted some awesome settings advice for football, basketball, etc so look out for that. After the adjustments, the picture quality is amazing.But that's about it.

I was pleasantly surprised at the plasma like black levels on this TV when set in the standard picture viewing mode. This is rare for an LED TV. There is minimal glare even in broad daylight. To get the very bright vivid color you can set the TV on dynamic though I found the standard mode to be more impressive. You can easily adjust the color settings too to your preference. 3D pops on this Samsung tv especially when connected to a good home theater audio system blu ray/receiver with a high speed HDMI cable which supports 3D . There are numerous features that may be appealing particularly if you enjoy streaming. There is a smart hub which connects you to all the apps and you have access to the usual netflix, pandora, hulu, amazon,etc. offerings including a cool HBO Go app which gives you temporary access to past episodes of the more popular HBO shows. There is a camera app which can pan down with a good view of those in front of the TV that facilitates the use of Skype. There are also a lot of gimicky features like voice control and gestures. I turned these features off and have not missed them as I found that using the cable channel controls were easier. Navigation within the TV menu is quite good with the small silver touch screen remote provided. This cool remote control cannot navigate the menu of other devices that may be connected to the TV and therefore multiple remotes may be required especially if your WIFI network provider is cable. Another bone to pick with this TV is that despite the built in quad processor downloading photos are a pain - a common problem in most smart TV. Internet surfing at least is somewhat quicker especially if you get the QWERTY board. Overall, I love this TV because of the awesome picture quality in both 2D and 3D and highly recommend it especially for those who plan to hook it up to a good home theater audio system to take full advantage of all the features. I hooked my TV to the Samsung HT f6500w (see my review on Amazon)and found that it was easier to use the wireless smart hub from the HT than it was the TV itself.

I read many not so great reviews on last year's version of this tv and decided to wait to purchase due to quality control issues from alot of people. I waited until I read better reviews for this 2013 version.The tv is easy to set up right out of the box and connected smoothly to my home wifi network and internet as well as my dvr box. The stand design did not work for me since I use my tv at an angle and the new stand would have toppled over off my bookcase. I had to pay an additional fee to have someone install an arm into the back of my bookcase to hang the tv and not use the stand. Now the tv \"floats\" at an angle which works great for me but I wish there was still just a stand in the center with a swivel. Possibly being so thin..the screen cant support a center stand anymore.As far as the actual tv picture...I can notice a sharpness in the images that my older tv lacked which is due to the micro dimming feature and the blacker blacks. This tv displays a more natural looking color than the bright over the top colors of my previous tv.As far as features like voice command and hand gestures.. they dont really work for me. When I first started using the tv...when a louder song would come on ..the tv would just decide to change channels on its own thinking I was telling it to do something. I tested the same place in the program again and it changed the channel again? I had to turn the voice command feature off.  I tried to set up the hand gestures too and got error messages that said the feature would not work in my living room ..who knows why...but when the tv comes on..it waves at me...Hey back? Sometimes when I scratch my noseall this stuff comes on the screen and moves around and then disappears..weird. I had to turn that feature off too.The tv comes with a standard remote and then another fancier one that has a track pad to move around when using the smart tv options. Its pretty easy though I really wish Samsung would include a keyboard remote. They sell a bluetooth keyboard remote separately but at this price it should be included. There's an app I loaded for my Ipad that says it gives you a keyboard option. I tried it...but all I can find is a picture of the remote on the iPad but no keyboard option. I have to continue to play with that.The Smart TV apps work good so far. They have netflix so I dont have to use my Apple TV for that anymore. HBO GO is easy to use too. I wish they would add a Uverse or Comcast app as wellas Showtime Anytime and Starz. Maybe in the future.So bottom line..Great picture and size which is what I bought the tv for.

The only way to alleviate this problem is to completely turn off Auto Motion Plus, the feature that compensates for motion blur and judder. It goes without saying that if you turn this function off you will have bad motion blur and judder. Another issue with this smoothing feature is motion stutter. The screen will literally stutter like your TV is having the hiccups. You're immersed in a film and all of a sudden wonk, the whole screen shifts. I went through 5 updates with the first set and this issue was still present. Like a sucker I hoped one of Samsungs magical placebo firmware updates might fix it. Nope. Nothing fixed. Why would Samsung introduce a feature into their TV's that doesn't work correctly and is useless when turned on? How is it possible that such an expensive TV is released with such defects? The artifacts appear in most AMP settings: Clear, Standard, Smooth, and Custom with any introduction of judder reduction. The motion stutter will appear in all settings save for AMP OFF.3D: If you're a fan of 3D like me look elsewhere. This TV has bad crosstalk. If you don't know what that is google images will tell you. While watching 3D there will be outlines around objects. I've seen lots of crosstalk and this is pretty BAD. CNet mentioned this crosstalk in their review stating it was worse than the Sony but making it seem like no big deal. I believe the word was \"slightly\" worse than last years ES. I will attest: I watched hundreds of hours of 3D on the ES and there was NO crosstalk. Crosstalk is very annoying and a serious issue for any fan of 3D. What happened Samsung? Last year we have some of the worst panel uniformity imaginable and good 3D, and this year 3D is traded for slightly better uniformity? Not cool.Processing bugs: Read the owners thread at AvS. There are so many processing issues this TV will piss you off. You will get the TV turning off and on while watching content, you will have annoying pop ups that can't be remedied unless you disable something in your TV, you will get screen pops for SmartHub that are half the size of your screen (a previous reviewer posted a picture with the NetFlix screen which I've gotten about 5 times), you will get screen tearing, and your TV will freeze up. Samsung seems to know how to market their product nicely. I guess marketing makes more money than quality. Both hardware and software for this years model is bad.Uniformity: It's much better than what I saw last year, but let's be realistic, a 3 thousand dollar TV with giant white blobs in all four corners? I'm not talking about a bit of flashlighting from the sides or corners, I'm talking about clouding. But here we go again, I can just compensate for the defects by enabling some Smart LED feature which crushes blacks. Oh wait, I can still see the clouds. Guess my backlight has to be set to 6? Nope, clouds still there... maybe 4? (remind me why I went with the LED over Plasma? Brightnes???) Same song from Samsung.Off angle viewing: All LED's suffer from it. Not a big deal. The only thing I want to throw in is that while looking off angle at an all black screen the clouds and bands actually appear green. Strange but not a problem.In the end this TV sucks. It has caused me a headache and time. I'm extremely disappointed with Samsung and vow to never buy a single one of their TV's again, I will think 10 times before looking at any of their other electronics. I was a big fan up to this point but after blowing 3000 and giving Samsung another chance this year, it's over. I will inform every friend and family member and spread word on all social media available about Samsungs cheap quality. This TV is going back, this time not for a hopeful exchange but for good. Cheers and happy viewing.Addendum: Before I bought this TV I read a review by someone who I thought was \"slamming\" Samsung. This is one of the very first 1 star reviews posted here and it has hundreds of comments. I read the glamorous \"professional\" reviews and nearly happy customer ratings and shrugged off the pesky one star reviewer as some sort of anti-Samsung crusader. Since then my view of this TV and this company is much more in line with that of this reviewer. I actually believe half of the reviews posted here and elsewhere for this set are marketing gimmicks (worked on me!). And no, not *every* TV has \"its issues\" - coming from experience. A high end TV at this price shouldn't have any issues period.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Even with a little bit of trouble, it's worth it", "Author": "Maevyn", "ReviewID": "R1EA9GWAB8WUBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review will encompass our TV as well as the experience getting it replaced. I will update that process as it goes on.The good:Lovely picture, easy to navigate with the swipe remote, and no more using an external device to stream videos. My husband and I enjoy watching Starcraft 2 streams via twitch, and now we can easily do that on our TV, as well as taking advantage of our Amazon Prime free video selection. The expanded menu buttons (more button) also have shortcuts to Amazon and Netflix. It also controls our Verizon Fios cable box without me having to pick up another remote. Our receiver, however, is too old to control. Not a big deal. The 3d works pretty well, and the glasses that come with it are comfortable. They also shipped them with batteries.The annoying: We were watching the Avengers in 3d (which was great on the TV, btw)  and something in the movie triggered the voice commands. We have since disabled that. A nuisance more than anything. Also, we didn't fancy the standard eco lighting settings, and have since made it brighter. Not a huge mess, just a small configuration. The 3d glasses seem to have a fickle time staying connected. Perhaps it was new user error, but once we paired them to test and make certain it was working, we had to re-pair them to the TV later when we decided to watch a movie. You can pair the glasses about 4 times on a battery charge, from the indicator's graphic, it seems. We're going to look into rechargeable glasses if we intend to use the 3d more often.The bad: We had to do a firmware update out of the box just to be able to connect to Samsung for the Smart Hub. It could connect to our internet fine, but because of the firmware version, it didn't know what to do. Samsung's chat help, if not contacted from their front page, would disconnect me after I asked the question. VERY frustrating. Also, when going to update via USB, you really do have to wait 3 minutes or so for it to be able to pick the update off of the stick. The first time I tried it, the stick was recognized right off, and asked if we wanted to view the pictures or anything on it. You have to wait before you can update the system via USB. That was really frustrating, and I couldn't figure out why we couldn't hit the net. Granted, we got it all squared away, but still.The Ugly: We had dead pixels. Not just one or two around, and they weren't easily noticed. It was a rectangular cluster with an almost comma like shape at the bottom about 5 inches from the top right of the TV (as you face it). I wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't been testing our Amazon instant video with Skyfall. There was a part where there was quite a bit of white on the screen at the beginning, and I finally saw it. It wasn't really visible when I was fiddling with the TV's Cable earlier in the day.Since we purchased the TV through Amazon, the return is going through Amazon instead of Samsung. I was trying to hook the TV up for my husband's birthday, and had spent pretty much the entirety of the day on the setup and wiring for his receiver. As it was an older one, without HDMI inputs, we've had to run optical out for his 7.1 system. I won't lie, it took forever. The other TV we were replacing didn't have HDMI either, and to take the thing down off the stand and re-work the wiring would've been a nightmare. I am eternally grateful to Amazon for sending a replacement ahead of the return, as we were willing to get another tv on our card and return the damaged one to avoid the wiring trouble. They sent the replacement TV overnight, and all seems well with it. The install process went MUCH smoother this time, as I already had the firmware update, and knew what to do. For now, we are having to pay the cost to return the TV, which is over 200 dollars to ship UPS (requires confirmation, and is a large package. Too large for me to drop off, so extra money to have it picked up), but I have been told by Amazon that since the unit was defective, we won't be responsible for the charges. I will update to confirm or warn people of how this goes.Bottom Line:Despite the trouble, I love this TV. I've already tested the TV mirroring on my Samsung phone and tablet, and am very happy with the unit as a whole. The picture is great, and we haven't fiddled with it. We're talking about getting a bluetooth keyboard in the future to help make search functions a little faster, but beyond that, it's been very nice so far. My recommendation to anyone who is getting this unit is to download the most current firmware first and be ready to install it right off the bat. After that, test the picture, and then enjoy.UPDATE (1/23/14): The tv is still working great, and after a bit of trouble, the return shipping was covered by Amazon (although not the entirety of it all in the beginning). I really wish it hadn't been such a fight, but it is what it is. This does, however, make me a bit more hesitant to buy something this big online from them. I am not, however, completely turned off to the idea. They took care of it all in the end, I just had to fight harder than I feel like I should have for it.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed", "Author": "Ghostwolf \"shadow-sphere\"", "ReviewID": "R2FKYGJW7HF4PV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "To make this review easier to read, I have refined it. In some areas I was able to compare to a store model:Picture (3.5 / 5): At times the picture deserves 5 stars, but there was some annoyances that took a way from the overall experience. And I go into detail below.Clouding: On my model, the clouding was there. This was most noticeable in the opening of Star Wars. I didn't see it that much on new movies (Spiderman / Lotr), but older movies (1970s,80s), I did see clouding in dark scenes. On a store model showing Avatar, I did not see clouding in the dark scenes.Motion: With motion enhancement turned OFF, I thought the TV handled motion well. I did see motion blur, but it is better than the skipping, stuttering, you will likely get with motion enhancement turned on. (Not to mention the dreaded SOE)Colors: Colors were vibrant, but flesh tones seemed off at times. For instance, Roger Moor in Moonraker looked like an orange in certain scenes. Blacks were also deep, but tended to lose details in things such as someone wearing black clothes or a very dark scene. The sewer scenes in the new spiderman appeared to lose a lot of detail.Viewing Angle: On my model, there was about a 30% decline in colors and detail moving to the sides. On a store model, I would say about 10% to 15%.Dirty Screen: The screen does suffer from this effect. Also, on bright scenes, I noticed these strange vertical gray streaks when the camera was panning. I checked the store model and saw them there as well. It is subtle, but when the camera moves, it almost appears that several gray lines (spaced out about 10 inches apart and quarter inch thick) are running down from top to bottom of the screen. You can see them better from a side angel, but dead on you can also see them.Sound: 3/5 -- The sound was fine. Nothing spectacular, but I'm assuming people will have a sound system (like me) to produce your sound.3D: NA --- I didn't review the 3D only because I will never use it.Smart Features: My current setup (Bluray,Xbox) can do all this without the need for the TV to do it for me. Therefore, I will never use these features.Gaming --- I used guitar hero to measure input lag. With gaming mode on, I got it to about 28ms. With all the smart features turned off and game mode on, I got it to 0ms.TV stand: Very unstable in my opinion. It was very wobbly and felt like it could tip over.Screen Reflectiveness: It wasn't bad. I don't remember being distracted from reflected images.Overall: This isn't a bad set. Although, I don't think it is worth the money. I would give it a 3.5 stars based on the problems I experienced.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "UN65F8000 REVIEW FOR DUMMIES AND OVER 50 GROUP", "Author": "Hydrawand \"golf addict\"", "ReviewID": "R2F4WYOPCGMZ9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think I am the first to post a review for the 65\" 8000 series, since they just started delivering them the last week of May.  Before ordering, I read the many techie reviews of the smaller 8000 models, so I thought I would write about the nuts and bolts things I love about the new set for older people like me.PICTURE:  First off, I went to several stores viewing the  Samsung 65\" 7100, and 7050  series models  (the 7050 comes with a keyboard also in the box) next  to the Sharp, LG, Sony, and Visio, and its very close, but to  my eye the Samsung is the best.  It is also the highest priced.  The 8000 is almost 2000 dollars more than one 65\" model.  That said, I am thrilled with the HD quality on such a large screen.  Watching Blu-ray movies on this is an incredible home theatre experience, and I am sure the kids will be thrilled with the 3D movies.  I also have to say that I don't see any difference between the picture on the  8000 series and 7000 series, which is selling for a grand less.  So unless you are very picky, and don't need the quad-core processor for the SMART features, you might be happier spending less money.  I do like that the 8000 got rid of the sheet metal edge trim on the front of the 7000 series and moved it to the side, so the front is all black.  All in all, this TV is a work of art, from the beautiful finish on the back,  with covers for power and input sections,  to the very sturdy stand, to the unique remote.THE REMOTE:  This is the coolest remote I have ever seen.  It has a carbon fiber back and a metal top, with raised icons substituting for buttons, so you easily feel them with your finger tip in the dark.  It is small but hefty, like a well-balanced gun. The touch pad is brilliant, allowing you to swipe through all the app and function icons on the screen, as well as a pop up number pad or keyboard.  The way you can rip though the channels and the volume with the UP and DOWN icons on this remote, is really what makes this TV the KING.  Unlike other HD TVs where the screen goes blank for about 2-3 seconds when you change channels, this TV is simply amazing.  It's instantaneous.  In fact you can hold down the UP or Down channel icon, and rip through about 20 channels in 2 seconds, which totally spoils you for any other TV if you like to channel surf.  To top it off, you don't even have to point it at the TV!Footnote:  My only wish is they would have put a \"RECALL\" button where the LIGHT button is, so that I could instantly jump back and forth between two football games, instead swiping the popup pad on the screen.  I see no need for the LIGHT button, since the icons all light up every time you press one anyway.  I went all out and also bought the Samsung keyboard to go with the TV, which has a few more handy function keys than the small remote.  The mouse pointer that comes on the screen when the keyboard is turned on does seem to be really slow and occasionally freeze. I am hoping there might be a way to fine tune or adjust this.SMART FEATURES:  When you turn on the TV, the current channel is playing in a PIP in the upper left hand corner, plus pictures of 12 other suggested channels, plus the menu at the top to swipe any other app or function. Very cool, being  connected to the internet,  you can download movies, programs, games, apps, and surf the internet with no computer, although it seems much slower than my powerful desktop PC and laser mouse.  You can also view what is on screen with your tablet, or phone screen.  I  am not sure if you will be saving any money by getting rid of cable or satellite boxes, since you will have to pay as much or more,  for a high speed Wi-Fi connection to prevent buffering, and you also have to pay for most of the premium internet programs you download.  It seems EVERYTHING is now smart.  The TVs, the game console, the 3D Blu-ray players, even the new home theater receiver's, so I am guessing you will now have to decide which remote to use to run apps.  lolThe speakers do not have the punch of my older 55 inch Samsung LCD, but are OK for everyday TV use, and I have a 600 watt home theater system for movies anyway.  I also bought  the new Samsung 3D Blu-ray player, and when you turn on the player it immediately shows the player menu screen, so you don't have to use the TV remote to switch inputs, like I did with my older TVs.I think the stand is beautiful and much steadier for a TV this size than a swivel, but I hung mine on the wall for the ultimate modern look to hide the cables, and sit higher than most cabinets.  In summary I think I will very happy with this TV  for at least 3 or 4 years, until the 4K prices come down, and I decide to get a 75 or 95 incher, where the 4K resolution will rule.UPDATE JAN 2014:  Still love the TV, but have a few beefs with the remote that would make it perfect for me if they would update it somehow. 1. Definitely change the light button to a previous channel button, using the on screen keypad is not quick enough for channel hopping between two games. 2. The battery life sucks. I have been putting new coppertops in every 2 months. 3.  the case is hard to open to change the batteries, but pops off and the batteries fall out if I just barely drop it.  GREAT NEWS! SAMSUNG is now offering a FREE 2nd REMOTE with standard buttons with this TV model.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks great. Sounds great. Overall Great. Did I say great yet?", "Author": "Daniel Ramirez", "ReviewID": "R1E1YZSNKI8YYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly, I was a little hesitant buying another Samsung TV. My last one had issues shortly after I got it and needed replacing after just 4 years. But I did a LOT of research on both LED and plasma sets. Long story short, I decided to go with LED and this one is the set everyone said I should get (hey, that rhymed!).Picture:Amazing. Personally, I find everything I throw at is just looks VERY good to great. The set even seems to bring older DVD disc picture quality up a notch. Remember though that for great picture, you need a great source. Your cable box for the most part will give you VERY good picture. If you want to see the best picture though, you need a better source like blurays or 1080p digital video. One thing that sometimes takes away from the picture though, like almost all sets on the market, is a VERY shiny/reflective screen. Coming from a matte LCD, this took some getting used to because I have a rather large window that this TV faces. As a result, at least during the day, for optimal picture quality I have to shut the blinds/curtains. Even at night you can sort of see a rainbow like reflection from light bulbs that may be on in the room. Like I said though, this is the majority of the sets on the market now. Even the highly reviewed Panasonic and Samsung plasmas have this issue. If you are buying this TV and will have it facing a window, this may annoy you. As a vampire who hates light to begin with, I finally have a good reason to close the curtain.Side/angle viewing:Like all LEDs, this tv looks the BEST when viewed straight on. You do notice a contrast change at extreme angles. If you are a super videophile, you will notice this. Then again, if you were REALLY a videophile, you would have probably gone with a Plasma for this very reason. Personally, I don't think it is a dramatic enough change that it bothered me in the slightest, but I thought it was worth mentioning for those of you who forget about such things.Stand:It's been mentioned in many reviews so I am just confirming this, you don't want to put this on a table that isn't as wide or wider than the stand. If it is shorter, the TV tends to lean forward and will most likely drop. I didn't have a table to put this on so while I was waiting for my TV mount to come in, I sat this on the floor and it still seemed to lean forward a bit. I ended up putting a few pieces of cardboard under both ends of the stand just to be sure it didn't tip forward.Inputs/power:Plenty of inputs on the TV (hdmi digital, etc) I'm not going to go over everything as it's in the specs. I sort of wish the power plug was closer to the HDMI ports on this though. When I put the TV on the wall mount, it would have been nice to have just one bundle of cables coming from the TV. Instead on one side I have this one random cable leaving the TV and on the other everything else. This was probably a decision based on the thickness of the TV and very minor. The power cable it came with was not long enough to make it to the floor once I put it on the TV so if you aren't routing the cables through the inside of the wall (I had a few reasons I couldn't do this) then you will need an extension cord. Another thing to keep in mind is if you have one of those cables with the big bulky ferrite cores, it may put undue stress on the port on the TV. I had a bunch of those and ended up getting some new SUPER thin Redmere cables from Monoprice which worked perfectly. If you don't want the super thin redmere, the Amazon Basics cables work GREAT as well. I have a bunch of them and they are very reasonably priced.Sound:I was surprised how good the sound was on the TV. I had a cheap receiver I was going to use with this, but even before I plugged it in the TV speakers were loud and simulated surround sound amusingly well. On a related note, once I did put the receiver in place, I started to notice a difference between when people would move their lips on screen and when I heard the sound. Based on some research I did, this is a result of all of the processing the TV does on the picture. When the TV is in Game mode (all of the processing turned off) the lag goes away. Unfortunately the receiver I have is a cheap RCA one, but on better receivers I read you can adjust the timing on the sound to resolve this. From what I've read, the sound is 100ms off. If you want to hear what I am talking about, turn the TV speakers AND the receiver speakers on at the same time and you will hear an echo (where in game mode you don't).Smart apps/camera:I haven't tried this out too much. I didn't buy the TV with these in mind. I have tried out the skype app and the youtube app. The skype app works great. Inputting your information with the remote is a PAIN though. If you intend to seriously use the apps, get yourself a compatible keyboard. Trust me on this one. The camera is VERY clear. We tested it with my sister's android skype app and the first thing she said was \"Damn, that's a clear picture.\" Thing is though, you can't move the camera to point in other directions so when mounted, I had to stand up for anyone to see me in the camera. While sitting on my couch, all you could see was the top of my head. The youtube app I sort of discovered accidentally when I pressed a button I had never seen before on my iPhone and suddenly the video was playing. It was VERY clear and sounded great, but then again that will most likely depend on the source. Some lower quality videos looked awful on the big screen.Online/Internet:I didn't use the browser (and as I have lots or other devices with browsers I probably never will). However, connecting to the Internet was SUPER easy and the connection seemed fast as the first firmware update I did downloaded quickly.Smart apps/features I haven't tried but will eventually:Honestly, this TV has a lot to it and I could spend a month playing with it. If I did though I would never watch TV. A few cool things I noticed was the ability to choose programing right from the TV for my cable provider. I think it has the ability to control the cable box (optional IR cables?) and graphically show me popular TV programs about to appear. It had a Fox app for viewing fox programing (it required a little setup so I didn't try it yet) too. Many other things. Honestly, I should have left this out since I can't even remember everything it has, but I definitely plan on spending my next vacation time finding out. I'll update the review if anything interesting comes up.3D:The TV can convert 2D content to 3D, and also split picture (side by side or top and bottom) 3D. There MAY be one more thing, but off the top of my head I don't recall. The 3D looked great in movies designed with 3D in mind. I watched Madagascar 3, Journey 2 and Pacific Rim. All looked like the high end 3D in the theaters. 2D to 3D was very good, but definitely not as good. I took the glasses off to see what it was doing and seemed to switch a lot between 2D and 3D (maybe so you noticed it was working?). Speaking of the glasses, were actually pretty comfortable. Sure they felt like cheap plastic and you have to put them together, but I had them on for a while and they didn't bother me. The battery in the device is a coin battery (like a BIOS battery for your computer). They have a button on the top, but I have yet to master what everything means. What I mean by that is, I don't know when they are on and when they are off. SOMETIMES the TV displays an alert when I turn a set on, sometimes it doesn't. The set comes with 4 pairs of glasses. One thing I don't like is that the arms don't fold so storing them is a pain unless you take off the arms every time which looks like it may eventually break the plastic.The remote:It comes with two remotes. One is the standard TV looking remote and one is the voice control remote. As the standard remote did everything I need I haven't even taken the voice remote out of the box it came in. When I do and if I have anything to add about it I will include it here. One thing I wish that the standard remote had is a better backlight. I have a popcorn hour (digital media player) which has an AMAZING backlight (Google it). Every button is SUPER bright when clicked so you can clearly see what you are doing. This has some light, but definitely not enough.Price:I wanted the best. I paid for the best. Did I over pay for a TV? Would I have been happier with a cheaper TV? Maybe. Maybe not. Honestly, I don't think I can answer that without buying hundreds of TVs at different price ranges. I purchased this TV based on several reviews here and on other sites and I am happy with it, so I guess it was worth it. Not to mention, I first tried to buy this TV from a company called Abe's of Maine because it was a good amount cheaper. Trust me, NO savings is worth the hassle of dealing with that company. STAY AWAY and buy from Amazon.Amazon:Amazon is the best. The price of the TV dropped shortly after I purchased it and they refunded the difference during what I have to say was the FUNNIEST online chat I have ever had. I've never had a chat rep say w00t w00t to me before. It was definitely a pleasure.\"WHITE GLOVE\" delivery:OK. So I didn't pay for delivery so I guess I can't complain too much. I live in Long Island NY. The company that delivered my TV was CEVA. This isn't my first time getting a TV delivered from Amazon. The first one was exceptional. This time, eh. The first time, the guy called, showed up at the time that I expected him with the TV on a hand truck. At the time I didn't even think about why I would want to turn a TV on before he left, but he insisted so that I new the TV was working. Then he gave me the sheet to sign off and left. I tipped him well. I believe the company was called Eagle at the time which may have merged with CEVA. Fast forward to two months ago when I got the delivery. The good thing was that the guy called and asked if he could deliver it earlier. Funny thing is, I liked that as I had some cancelled plans and honestly was just waiting around for him. The guy had a heavy accent but was VERY nice. He gets to my house (I see him drive up), jumps up to the back of a very large truck, gets my TV (by himself mind you) and slings it on his shoulder as if it was an 80's style boom box. He jumps down and then walks into my house asking where I want it. He puts me down and makes me sign the delivery paper and leaves. No chance to open the box and test it, no removal of packing materials. Nothing. I didn't tip this guy. The TV was fine, but just seemed a bit unprofessional. Then, later i check, and the tracking said I received a two person delivery, that the TV was set up, that I tested it and that they took away the packing material, none of which was done. So I guess the good was that the TV got into my house and worked and the delivery guy was VERY nice, but everything else left a bad taste in my mouth.Overall:I am very happy with this TV. It looks great (both picture quality and the build) and has more features than I could ever need or use. If I would change one thing about the TV I would make it a matte screen even if the picture would suffer a little. This would eliminate the glare. Honestly though, you get used to it and eventually your eyes learn to ignore it. If that is one of your biggest criticisms about this TV, I say give it some time.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but a little expensive with so many useless add-ons", "Author": "joe schmoe", "ReviewID": "R5ZB999PPEMNR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The good:Great picture quality.  Bright whites and dark blacks.  One of the only LED's that don't look pixelized to me.  The front bezel is also so thin and it just makes the whole tv look so sleek.The bad:I don't care for the new stand, but I wall mounted mine anyways.  I also don't like the new style remote.  I use a universal remote and it just makes programming it difficult.  Way too much menu - meaning that I don't care to have so many apps and menus.  It makes using the DLNA movie feature a pain because I have to use the tv remote and not my universal and even with the tv remote it still not very convenient.  Price - it's a bit expensive.Story:My Pioneer Plasma just died on me so I've been shopping around and actually buying and trying a few replacement TV's.  I also just added a new window to my tv room so the room is very bright in the daytime.  First off, I tried to replace my Pioneer with a Panasonic st50 plasma.  While the picture was pretty darn good and the price was great - I wasn't overly blown away at the picture quality - particularly a grey hue on the screen unless the room is really dark.  So, I went into a retail store and compared the new Samsung UNf8000 side by side with the Panasonic St50 plasma.  After toying with setting for a long time, the samsung was the clear winner.  It had such brighter whites and darker blacks and for the first time every, I didn't get a really pixelized led look.  The unfortunate part is that it retails for more than twice the cost of the panasonic, but I think its a great tv.  I wish that they made a model with the exact picture quality but saved some money on apps, camera's, voice recognition, motion control, etc...

Setup was easily accomplished by connecting the cables to the well labeled inputs.  One tip for those who choose to mount this TV (or any TV for that matter) on the wall as I have - you really should make all of your connections prior to mounting on the wall, especially if you have a low profile mount.  Otherwise, you may not have enough clearance to make your connections between the rear of the TV and the wall's surface.  You may even want to purchase a \"swing out\" mount to ensure easy access to the rear connections.The image is impressive and truly is worth the additional expense, especially when you consider that this TV is comparable to the best of plasma screens (which are on their way out it appears).  The Smart TV functions are well laid out and the Smart Interaction feature works well, but you may find that you don't use it very frequently unless you can't find one of the two included remotes.  The Smart Remote is well designed and easy to use with practice.The sound is reasonable for such a thin and large TV, but if you truly want excellent sound, purchase a home theater speaker system.The 3D images (even those that are upgraded from 2D sources) is very good.  The images are clear and bright and the 3D glasses are incredibly light, although not rechargeable.  Honestly though, the batteries are very affordable and do have a pretty long life.Some gripes - I do wish that this TV came with a longer electric cable, but a trip to Radio Shack should solve that problem.  I also think that this TV should come with a keyboard instead of at an additional cost of about $99.00.

The 8000F has surpassed the older set in brightness and definition, although not dramatically.  What I like best about it is the reduction in the bezel around the panel itself, and it is so low-profile, it makes the set appear to be floating in air.  I added the Ikea multi-color diode kit to the back of the display to create attractive ambient light reflecting from the drywall in back of the set and it reduces eyestrain and lessens any need for lights in the room at night.Another surprise?  My five-year old flat panel is at least three time heavier than this light-weight beauty.I did make manual adjustments to the factory presets in the set-up for contrast, backlight, sharpness, color saturation and other settings to achieve a more realistic color and offset the too-vivid settings that seemed to be over-driving the panel and in cases of faces, \"blooming\" in highlights.I'm getting used t the new smart remote, and like it so far, but am irritated by the too sensitive microphone that is always listening for a command and can shunt the sound off if it detects at a threshold level.  Solution?  Turn it over facedown when not in use or move it away from any rear speaker.I haven't really used the 3D capability as it is still an immature format and there isn't enough programming or media available for it, although I'm ready with a 3D capable Blue-ray player and the 8000F.I've bought at least 7 Samsung flat panel LCDs ove the past 8 years for my home and my family.  Except in one case, I have been well-pleased and am very impressed by the technological leap of this model.  Can't wait for the OLED versions once they are fielded, tested and proven reliable.

It is unstable. (It's in danger of falling forward even on a flat floor) AND impractical as you need A 53 INCH WIDE TABLE to accommodate this unstable freak!  OH! you say... How can this be true?  Does this reviewer know what he is talking about? Well, the stand IS fully as wide as the 60\" wide-screen TV!  (51 inches) and the two tips of the stand only extend TWO AND A HALF inches in front of the set... Now since the set is 32 inches high, just a small force on the back of the TV and it falls forward on to what? THE SCREEN!!  And if your table is 2 inches too narrow you cannot support the last inch of the 2.5 inches holding the TV back.  As far as the picture and \"smart\" issues...  I'll have to wait until I find a WIDE coffee table or buy a 54\" wide piece of 3/4 inch plywood to go any farther than I am now...  to actually WATCH my tv at eye level!  Pardon my excitement.  P.S.  The stand does extend 9 and 3/8 inches behind the TV so it's relatively safe from being pushed over backwards. Great work Samsung.Okay.. I'm better now. I cut a 54X17 piece of 22/32\" finish plywood (35$ a sheet) so my set is safe and happy, and the picture is GREAT! I cut down on the brightness and color and I have an exceptionally clear and natural picture so I've added 2 more stars. I did buy the set on the strength of reviews on the picture so Samsung is vindicated for its mechanical shortcoming. I may even get a compliment for my natural wood-top TV table now.

Janapa \"Djei\"", "ReviewID": "R1RVCACVWS2P4O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I upgraded to this beautiful looking tv from another then (2011) beautiful/sleek tv UN55D8000.I purchased this 60\" TV from PaulsTV almost a month ago, they were then offering no Sales TAX along with the standard samsung promotion of 29\" UN29F6400 or Soundbar. Amazon now charges sales tax for CA residents, so had to look for other options.First impressionI initially felt that the 2011 one was much sleeker than this, but eventually and with the bare back i was completely bowled over with the design. It is definitely the best looking 2013 TV in the market and Samsung has always maintained that for long time now.Very easy to setup as always. i configured my timewarnercable box with the tv and pairing the remote is as well pretty easy.Picture qualityPicture quality is simply amazing, considering the size of the TV. Now and then i felt the picture felt like pasty/painting kinda thing..but guess that also depends upon the channel/show you are watching.Overall i would say that the picture was very sharp, the colors were very natural and bright. I loved watching regular tv shows, streaming videos using apps and from my macbook. simply the best picture.SoundThe sound is definitely much better than the 2011 TV. i guess the reason, might be that the speakers are now at the bottom of the tv instead of being at the back. I felt the need for my bose speakers with my 2011 tv but with this one i feel i can manage with out external speakers. Not great sound but pretty decent i would say.Smart TVAll the apps that you can think of are on this tv. Has a very beautiful interface, easy to access or browse through.Based on what you watch, the TV provides recommendations or what are the next programs in line that you might want to watch as it syncs up with you cable setup box. It is a really cool feature but i havent used it much.The interface is grouped into multiple sections, such as SMART apps (internet streaming content/videos), social, current tv and recommendations and movies (lists out all new movies and then gives you options to choose from where you would want to watch them from say, cinemanow or vudu)One bad thing is it doesnt give you an option to play from amazon instant video.I also like the way the source options are lined up now, instead of vertical they now appear horizontally on the top of the tv.CameraBest thing compared to the 2012 tv is that, you can now hide the camera when you dont need it and when you need it just by pushing it the camera will appear. I had not tried the camera on 2012 tv, the picture with this one is very sharp/clear. guess it is a 720p camera. I once skyped with my family and they were amazed how sharp the picture was.Well just for trial purposed, i used it. But dont think anyone would want to skype using a tv :) What are ipads and iphones for?RemoteWhat a sleek remote. Easy to navigate, very small. I like the fact that now you operate everything using the virtual remote on the TV.at times gets on to your nerves, because everything (changing channels, options) are not in one place. I will have shift from one window of the virtual remote to the another :) slight inconvenience.MicHere is the defect i have noticed. To speak with the tv one is supposed to press the mic button on the remote and then speak to it. That communication is just great. The TV understands you very well.The issue is, some times the mic just pops up on the tv and expects me to speak. This is annoying when you are seriously watching a movie or a show, the mic popsup and silences the background tv show / also blocks the view.I have taken out one star, for the inconvenience the mic causes now and then. Also add the slight inconvenience one faces with operating the virtual remote.One more thing, try out the samsung tv remote app for ios. Its simply cool. If you have to step away from the tv, you can still watch it on the phone. there is a small window on the remote app, which displays the tv show being aired on the tv. This works only with the cable tv and not if you are watching netflix or any streaming apps or if you are streaming videos from ur laptop.Still a cool feature, but i dont think i would use it on day to day basis :)Overall a great tv, sleek and the only amazing looking tv, with a great picture quality, decent sound.Would highly recommend this to anyone.Also i did not come across any uniformity issues or clouding like others have faced. The only issue i came across was with the mic. I have talked to paulstv and they are now going to replace it for me.

Friends that came over to help me install really wanted the tv too after they saw it.The Bad:1) And this one really bugs me.. There is light bleed at the bottom of the TV. It is almost all the way across. Size of a sliver,.. but of course noticable. It is between the back edge and chrome edge of the TV. If i stand up i cannot see it. The only way to notice it really is if I am sitting at eye level to the bottom of the tv. I think to resolve i may be able to discretly plug with electrical tape or something... but not what i was hoping for with a $3000 + purchase.2) I think the sound can be better. I may need to play with settings more. But diagolue very quiet compared to action scenes when i was watching movie. I'm also investing in a home theatre or couple speakers.. so this won't but me as much soon. but could for other people.3) It is defaulting to non-hd channels from the smart interface.

TV's of this class have never been cheaper.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step is to look at the features that are offered with the TV.  Here are some offered by this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In and 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.Clear Motion Rate (CMR) is another feature that comes with this TV.  CMR gives you motion-clarity that can display action-packed movement with superior sharpness, clarity and contrast.With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter.

It's impressive even when it's off. And the screen is so thin (front to back) it's amazing. In terms of picture quality, despite the edge lit (rather than \"full array\" or \"back lit\"), the blacks are inky black and I see no light escaping at the edges. It's really good. I see no banding in images with shades of black. Color seems spot on. It's a great set.I also like that I can plug a thumb drive or hard drive with pictures or a videos into one of the USB ports in the back and watch a home video rather easily. The port should have been on the side however. Once I wall mount this, it will be harder to do such things. The two remotes seem to be largely redundant and unnecessary.There are some issues, however. The menus are elaborate and will take some getting used to. The images are so large and detailed that some movies tend to look amateurishly taped on a home camcorder. Slight movements in the camera are obvious on the screen, and this screen is unforgiving when there is bad focus in the original material. It seems that many sources are just not up to satisfying this monster's ability to resolve details. I also have a Panasonic plasma and the picture on the plasma just seems richer. But plasmas are going away and LED/LCD sets like this one do overcome bright rooms far better.I was torn between UHD and \"really large,\" and I concluded that UHD standards have not quite been decided upon and that I don't want to get a UHD set too early. Sets with H.265 and HDMI 2.0 are not yet available, for instance, and I don't know when they will be. So I went large.

Looked at Sonys, Vizios, Sharps, and Samsungs, including the 4k models.  Through the course of research, I went through the different brands, and finally got to see all the top models of each brand in person.  All were pretty good with the Sony 4k set really being the best, but that was only with a 4K signal being sent to it.  It was also more than $5K in price.  In general I found Sharps had an ok picture, Vizio's had a good picture, but quality control worried me, Sony 550 series also had a good picture, but not one to take your breath away, finally Samsung F-8000 seemed to have the brightest and best picture.  4k sets just had to be dropped from my consideration due to price.  TVs are in a flux period with 4K signals, and OLED sets.  The Samsung seemed to be a good compromise for the next 5-8 years, a great picture that will still hold up for the next 5-8 years.The picture is really tremendous.  I used some on line setting for adjustment and have watched a number of BR movies and they are spectacular.  Black detail seems good to me along with minimal to no soap opera effect.  Where I am really impressed with the TV was watching the baseball playoff and the World Series, along with other sports.  The World Series was just about about perfect (I am a Red Sox fan) in picture quality and results.  I didn't think fox was know for a good signal but they outdid themselves with the World Series.  I should mention that my signal provider is DISH Network.  The best picture I have ever seen was a Wyoming Football game on Root Sports.  It was really like sitting on the 50 yard line.There is a lot of conectivity with the TV.  WIFI, movies over the net, and more stuff than I have been able to get to let alone figure out.  the remote seems good but I mostly use the Dish remote, which hooked up with no problems.hOff angle viewing seems to be pretty good and I am surprised at the people who downgrade this TV for poor off angle.  Screen reflection is not as good as I would like, but after looking at just about all the major brands including the Sharps (known for low reflection)  I found them all to be similar.  I can watch this set on a sunny afternoon  in a room with 4 1x5 foot windows that are south facing and not get a washed out picture.I can find no evidence of flash lighting or dirty screen effect.  Hockey ice looks white with no evidence of banding nor DSE.  Dark corners show no evidence of flash lighting, but I have not purchased a test disc to to absolutely sure.  If it does flashlight it does not appear to show up in content.Sound is good but weird, with superfine adjustment on the levels, and kink of a strange sound staging due to the downward firing speakers.Amazon also had a deal when I bought this TV of throwing in an additional 29\" Samsung LED TV.  That coupled with free shipping, a great return policy, no sales tax, and setup through inhanced shipping seemed like a no brainer for me so I ordered.Inhanced delivery in the state of Wyoming consists of the truck driver telling me \" I help you get it off the back of the truck, and help you carry it to you door\"  After pleading my case I got no wheres with the truck driver.  I did call Amazon to complain and they offered me $100 credit on my CC.  That seemed like a great deal to me, so no stars deducted for delivery.If this set has good quality control and I have no problems I will be very happy.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Spectacular image and mostly amazing features, but motion and voice recognition fail.", "Author": "Blankstar", "ReviewID": "R1BJ9YPJ9VVKGD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This television is amazing.

So is it worth it.....Pros:  Excellent picture.  Blacks are black,  excellent contrast and color.  Netflix, Amazon Prime, Skype, Facebook apps all preloaded.  Remote control is easy and intuitive.  I did not notice any edge bluming as others have seen.  Play a BlueRay disk and the detail is really impressive.  It does a good job of upscaling standard def media as well.Cons:  If I sit off center by 50  degrees, the color starts to wash out.  Reds become a faded red, etc.  Voice control kicks in when my kid is too loud, had to turn this off.  Facebook app is clunky.  Comes with an IR remote line to stick in front of your cable box, so your TV remote can control your Dish or Direct TV box - this simply did not work for me.  I also connected to our home network where I share my media files,  the Samsung simply cannot access the files.Conclusion:  The Samsung F8000 series is a solid performer.  It has some problems with the features, and  there is some washout at obtuse angle viewing, but sit back in the sweet spot and play a BD of LOTR -  you'll see the money was well spent.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "darryl huyett", "ReviewID": "R3MPEN79T9VHNX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Three weeks and happy.

But after going through SO many issues with last years model (es8000) I thought I was through with Samsung. All it took was one visit to best buy to see the picture quality on this set and I was sold. The picutre is absolutely pristine in every way. Colors are vibrant and so crisp and the black levels are deep and very clean. I have yet to notice any clouding or flashlighting with this tv unlike last years model. Besides having a couple times where the remote had just stopped working for a few minutes, it is a hundred times better than last years remote and is very smooth when navigating through the features. Voice recognition and hand gestures are very much improved as well, though I don't use the hand gestures much at all. One other issue I've had is the apps freezing. This has happended a couple times when opening the app and once into it, it would just freeze up and I would have to exit it. I wouldn't necessarily consider that a glitch on the tvs part though. The popular apps such as netflix, hulu, and amazon instant have worked flawlessly which is really all I care about and use most of the time anyways. When browsing the web this thing is lighting fast!! I have found myself using this as my new computer on my down time rather that my 27 inch Mac desktop. I also purchased the samsung wireless keyboard which also works great and so much more convienent than typing with the remote. I am a perfectionist, and overall I could not be happier with this TV. If I had to pick one main downfall it would be that it's a 60 inch. Just seems a little too small for my liking. I will more than likely trade this in for the 65 inch once that is released in the upcoming weeks. I would definitely recommend this set.

The ONLY reason this gets 4 stars rather then 5! Amazon called on our behalf, however no movement on the date change. Not happy there. The TV arrived and it was ice cold so I decided NOT to plug it in until the set became room temperature. Once I plugged it in and concocted all the devices, I was blown away with the claret of this set! I did nothing out of the box and to be honest, I have never watched a movie until I watched it on this set. Breathtaking clarity. Even in full HC 3D the picture was amazing.

So far so good but I'm still learning all its capabilities. I bought this TV along with a Samsung Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Note 8. They do all work together but it takes some trial and error.One thing I've been sorting out is all the add-on apps that come pre-installed from various vendors, many all do or offer the same features so you have to try each and decide which work best for you. Some you find out after going through the setup that's its a 'Trial' version so they want you to download the full version or buy the monthly subscription for $9.99 pr/mo.  It's like when you buy a new PC and the first thing you must do is uninstall or disable all the add-on crap.If you plan to hook this TV to wan external audio receiver you'll need to take note. Regardless of what receiver you own you'll need to connect it to TV HDMI 3 (ARC) or your TV audio will never go through the receiver speakers, instead will sound through the TV speakers.The speech recognition takes some getting used to and doubt I'll use it very much. It only understand part of what I'm asking it to do. I was born in the US so don't have an accent but keep in mind where this TV was made when you use it. Also, I've seen the TV react to what it thinks is a command while watching TV while the remote is sitting on the coffee table untouched.The camera is ok but pretty sure I won't use the motion detection for interacting with the TV. This feature might be fun to keep kids entertained but for me, its unnecessary so I turn it off.There is another annoyance but maybe I haven't figured it all out yet. When switching between inputs on the receiver, the TV will popup a message that it can't detect the Set Top Box (STB) when all I'm doing is switching to the DVD player or game box. You have to stop what your doing, pick up the TV remote and click OK or the popup won't go away. A real pain in the butt if you have to do this often. I would like to turn that popup off somehow since I could care less.Overall though, the TV is nice, picture is great. I wish I could customize the SmartTV apps though. That is to hide or minimize features I don't have or want instead of having to page through them all. It's funny too that a lot of the suggested TV shows are on channels I don't subscribe to on DishNetwork. What happens is you don't it until you pick it and then have to pick up the DishNetwork remote to back out of the popup asking you to subscribe.  Would be great if I could customize the listing to offer shows only on channels in which I am a subscriber.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung 46F8000", "Author": "Lu C", "ReviewID": "R1HTJKVQWYEUD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic product.

I looked at quite a few other TVs and it very sharp compared to many others. The extra features of this particular model have been discussed at length by other posters.I wish the on/off button on the set was not so far from the edge.  Ours is sitting in a cabinet and the edge is right up against the side.  You can't reach the button from under the unit only from the side.I don't find the voice response usable and actually a distraction so we turned it off.The stand is a tip hazard,  If you move either tip of the stand more than four inches off of the surface it is sitting on, You have to support the TV. The stand looks good, just doesn't work that well.  Fashion over function issue.Now the really bad.  It has been only 9 months since we purchased the unit and it is starting to have a problem turning on.  It starts cycling at start up multiple times.  It just clicks on and off without getting the screen to start up. Now, it is still under warranty and will probably get fixed, but that is not the issue.  Samsung TVs have had this same problem on so many different TVs and for so long that you have to assume that they just can't really correct the issue.  Getting it fixed sometimes seems to just delay it happening again.  There was a multi-year class action lawsuit that addressed this exact same issue.  That specific lawsuit ended in February, 2014.  Obviously, this particular unit is not in that lawsuit, but there are so many websites that talk about the same problem and it doesn't look like they have fixed it even on their most expensive/new units.

I was able to get around this problem by simply unplugging both and powering them on simultaneously.The music interface and navigation menus for extended storage like an external USB drive in the TV's firmware leaves a little to be desired. It will most definitely play music but it isn't a Windows Media Player or Winamp experience by any means.

The service from Samsung is horrible.After owning the TV for just over a month, it starts randomly rebooting itself. I called Samsung for repair and after two repair centers contracted by them said they could not service my area, Samsung agreed to send a replacement.I was told by Samsung the delivery company would take the old TV off of the stand it was mounted to and place the new TV onto the stand.On the day of delivery Samsung denies telling me this and expects me to lift a 50lb+ TV off of a stand. I am just hoping the delivery company will assist with this.I finally received the replacement TV, which is after a week, already doing the same thing by randomly rebooting itself. Called Samsung again and was told to unplug it from the surge protector, plug it directly into the wall and call back if it happens again. Once again, they just want you off of the phone. Two days later it rebooted again on its own. Samsung has now told me they are aware of the issues with this model and are working on a Firmware to fix them.I seriously doubt this. They would not have shipped me a new TV the first time were this the case.Purchased TV in late December of 2013 received a replacement in late February of 2014 and now it is March and I am back on the phone with Samsung with the same problem.Do Not buy this TV.If and when Samsung ever makes this right, I will gladly update my review.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really nice, but not too different from lower cost model", "Author": "Raudi", "ReviewID": "R1ZPAG8PS0CA6P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I compared this side by side with a Samsung F7050 bought locally. This TV is very nice with a nice picture and awesome slim design (considering I upgraded from a 10 year old plasma). However, I have it side by side with a 2013 Samsung 7050 (from everyone's favorite warehouse club). My F8000 is a 60 inch and the F7050 is a 55 inch, otherwise I can barely tell the difference in picture quality or sound.The F8000 does offer more picture and sound features, but I can barely tell the difference in quality.Ultra Clear Panel - The F8000 does have (a little) less glare from ambient lighting, however the Ultra Clear Panel on the F8000 is marketed far better than it performs. I have *severe* reflections on the screen during the day and a decent amount of reflections at night, something I am very disappointed about and lowered my overall rating by 1 star. TVs at this price point should not have reflections of this magnitude on the screen.Voice Control - The voice control is not very useful. Saying 'Volume Up' requires pressing the microphone button then saying 'Volume Up.' The volume only increases by 1. You can say 'Volume Up 25' to increase the volume (or lower it) by 25, but the TV mutes while doing this, so if you are currently watching something you will not hear what is going on. It is far quicker to just press the +/- button to adjust the volume.Motion Control - It works, except in dark rooms. The motion control seems cool at first, but I doubt I will use it very often. Sometimes I have difficulty getting the motion control interface to initiate. Overall, it is simpler to just pick up the remote control and do what you want.Clear Motion Rate - One reason I leaned toward the F8000 was the specs (Clear Motion Rate of 1200), but having the F7050 side by side, which has a Clear Motion Rate of 720, I see no difference.Quad Core Processing - Again, side by side with the Dual Core processor of the F7050, I see no difference. The apps might load a little faster, but I cannot swear to that.Apps - My biggest complaint with the apps is the overall volume for all Apps is far lower than when watching TV. Sometimes I have the volume maxed out at 100 when in an app. Seems like a simple programming fix that Samsung could/should implement. The Netflix app works mostly well with occasional glitches. The Amazon and Vudu apps also seem to work well. The YouTube app is horrible with many videos not being available and many that say they are available just provide a black screen when trying to view. The Web browser is beyond horrible. To compensate for YouTube and the Web Browser, I am just going to hook up a Mac Mini once I find a cable that lets me connect it to the TV.If it was not a pain and if return shipping was free through Amazon, I would prefer to get the F7100 or F7500 60 inch to save money. However, unlike another reviewer, I very much prefer the stand on the F8000. It is less obvious and creates a more minimalistic appearance - one of the biggest reasons I chose Samsung over other brands. I like how the picture appears to float in the air. Just too bad the reflection from ambient lighting ruins much of the presentation.If you realize that the voice and motion control will not be used much, the Samsung F7050 (or similar lower cost models) will suit you just fine and let you save some cash.Overall impression - Samsung is promising the future and useful features. They are not delivering as well as their marketing department will lead you to believe. 3 star rating - 'It's OK' but not what I expected for the amount of money I spent.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tv with some minor problems", "Author": "Keeso", "ReviewID": "RODJQOMXQGC2Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The overall picture on the 60\" is fantastic. The cinema black feature is great for watching wide films. It shuts down the LEDs in the black bars so that they just disappear. After setup with the WOW disk it really looks fantastic. I have a few gripes though. In an all black scene, such as credits, the flash lighting is very distracting. Otherwise you don't notice it.Also playing DNLA videos can be a hassle since few formats allow ff or rr and don't keep your place. If you want to watch it again later you have to start all over again.My other complaint is that the cinema black feature only works on outside source films but not from apps such as amazon or vudu. Amazon movies don't show up in the movie recommendations or searches. These issues must be fixed if aSmartTv is really going to live up to its name.As for web browsing it truly is fast.

Everything works automatically; you just have to choose the source. The only problem I've had is with the wired network connection. Network speeds vary from 25Mb all the way down to 150Kb, causing Netflix to freeze & crash the TV (requiring me to unplug it). To avoid this, I've had to get the Samsung WIS12ABGNX WIS12ABGNX/AA LinkStick Wireless USB LAN Adapter 2010 2011 & 2012 Smart TV's . After a 2 minute auto configuration, it now connects to Netflix with no twitching problems of any kind.The built-in speakers are good, as most Samsungs tend to be, but you won't want to rely on them if you want to get the most out of your HD movies & TV shows, Get a good 5.1/7.2/9.2 Amp with good speakers.

So you have to scroll through 1000 channels to get there.  There is NO WAY to adjust this.  I have been researching it for a month.  You can use the STB (Set Top Box) guide button instead, but it's slower than when using the Time Warner remote.  Also, when I press the INFO button, it goes to the last channel.  Hello Samsung!!!??? Of course, if you don't have Time Warner, this may or may not apply to your TV.  The voice command feature is ok but sometimes annoying and doesn't work perfectly.

Imagine that you want to play a show you've DVRed - not exactly a double back flip with a twist degree of difficulty  The IR remote doesn't have a button to access DVRs.  The smart remote does, but once you're there, some of the smart buttons control playback, some don't (such as the \"Play\" button, for example).  Samsung customer support's response? The smart remote buttons are designed to be compatible with that function (nor, although is allegedly a universal remote, designed to be compatible with other things that might use Play, Fast Forward, and Rewind buttons, such as DVD players).  Which of the 3 stooges designed this device, or failed to ascertain that it's not market-ready?  You might get lucky and some functions might work - in our house Fast Forward and Rewind work, Play doesn't for DVR, nothing works for DVDs, and either remote controls the set-top box fine (except, as noted, the IR remote has no way to get to the DVR list).

The stand is pretty cool, looks like it floats in the air and no need to hang the TV on the wall. I wish the stand would be a little more narrow from the wall its about 10 inches and its as wide as the TV. I bought this for $1720 on e-bay brand new sealed from GEARS4Less and comes with a 1 year warranty from Samsung.Since I check out with my PayPal MasterCard the credit company doubles the warranty so I get 2 years total why spend more $$ on warranty. People reading this please remember most credit card companies offer to extended manufacture warranty so save your self some cash.Okay lets talk about the TV now, its amazing, Picture is great actually the best I ever seen on HD and Blueray, users complain the quality is low I disagree I give it 5 stars across 100 %. The touch features work GOOD during the day. At night yes maybe people have issues not enough lighting to work well, thats why I have LED light bulbs around the house. Bright and White clear lighting. The picture dots on the conners there is none compared to the old UN46ES8000. There is no lag, apps run super fast and smoother. The 1200 Blur Motion Rate is amazing on channels what a difference. I wish the Samsung APP store had more apps to choose like your android cell or Apple.Talking about the 3D its great, I love it, the fact Samsung offers free shows, documentary right on the TV its an APP built in. Everyday there is new shows in pure 3D. The conversion 2D to 3D not as good as the real 3D shows or a blue-ray DvD of course however its better then watching 2D. Trust me it makes a difference, do I always use it no I do not. I do use the touch hand controls, I use the smart-tv features, apps, and skype with family across the globe is cool that you can see them right from your TV set. The remote is easy to use, super easy, well for me I am Tech savvy. I believe for anyone it should be easy to use. The setup was simple from day 1.I love turning the TV on with my voice everyday \"Hi TV, Power On\"All the features this TV offers I have no complaints,Crystal Clear HD.

Perhaps this is unavoidable with edge lit, I'm trying to just ignore it for now. But disappointed as some of the reviews made it sound like this was solved.The problems that are more unexpected are the software glitches - Netflix froze up and went to a black screen, and I had to unplug the TV to get it to reset. It's turned on a couple times out of the blue, and other times I've turned it \"off\" but the Samsung light remains lit up (normally it turns off). Other freezes have happened, about half can be fixed by exiting, half require unplugging the TV. Also had some lip sync issues - assume it's with a faulty source, but it's happened randomly on both TV and Netflix and I never noticed with my previous TV, so not sure.Picture quality is stunning, and the physical appearance is spectacular... but I'm beginning to think that going for the Sony 950 would've been the better choice.One other positive is that the build quality does seem better than the ES8000 - the frame just feels more sturdy.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV! 3D works with Plex!!", "Author": "gadget-o-holic", "ReviewID": "R2S1QY24419DGV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV at Best Buy open box and am extremely happy with my purchase.  I'm coming from a 1080p Epson Projector that projected on to a 100\" screen.  I had decided that I wanted to try the newer LED tv's out since we were moving anyway and did not want to bring the projector with us to our new home.I primarily looked at two TV models when I was looking in to TV's, the Samsung UN60F8000 and the LG 55GA7900.  I actually bought and tested both of the TV's out.  Below is a short Pros/Cons review and conclusion on both TV's.LG 55GA7900-------------------------Pros- Price... much cheaper than the F8000- Google TV integration for Apps (apps to enable airplay/etc)- Decent picture quality- Awesome remoteCons- No ARC capability for HDMI audio passthrough- Plex app does not play 3D SBS files- Not all apps in google play store are available- Google TV interface for Tivo integration not the bestSamsung UN60F8000-------------------------Pros- Awesome picture quality- Innovative, if somewhat limited, remote (would like more dedicated buttons and a QWERTY keyboard- ARC capability!!! Can use single HDMI cable to pass 5.1DD and DTS audio back to receiver from apps like Plex, Amazon Instant Video, and Netflix- Built in Skype and camera- Built in Plex app supports 3D SBS files natively!!!Cons- Limited app selection (though the essential apps are there - Plex, Skype Amazon Instant Video, Netflix)- Price... would have liked it to be a few hundred cheaper- ARC setup is not intuitive and there is limited documentation on how to get it set upCONCLUSION-------------------------After testing both TV's I ended up keeping the Samsung UN60F8000.  Although I was impressed with many of the bells and whistles that the GA7900 provided, I ultimately did not find many of the features to be useful and I found many of the apps were a little buggy and the interface was not entirely intuitive.  I really only use my TV to do 2 things... watch TV and watch movies from Amazon/Netflix/Plex.  Everything else is really unnecessary for me as I find that browsing the internet and things like that are better suited for a tablet or laptop.  Overall, the F8000 seemed like a better TV for my purposes, plus I really like that I can use HDMI ARC to send 5.1 and DTS signals to my receiver when watching movies through netflix/amazon or Plex.  The final plus for me with the F8000 is that the Plex app is much better IMO than on the GA7900.  The plex app on the Samsung F8000 comes pre-installed and can play 3D movies natively whereas the GA7900 using the plex app could not play the same 3D movie.  I couldn't be happier with my TV choice... if you use plex and need HDMI ARC the F8000 seemed to be one of the few TV's that could actually send 5.1 and DTS signals over the ARC interface.  5 Stars!!!", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this TV", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "R3STO9M12V9WQL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best TV I have owned.

I was disappointed to discover that what is advertised as SPDIF digital audio out with Dolby support truly only supports 2 CHANNEL AUDIO output.  Even if your HDMI input source, or Netflix, or Hulu, or streaming video directly connected to the TV includes 7.1 / 5.1 surround audio - you only get 2 CHANNEL AUDIO.  Sigh - this was a huge disappointment.  What good is a 'hub' if you can't use it?  If you have a home theater setup, don't expect to use this TV as a video hub, and if you want to use the built in apps such as Netflix, or Hulu you will have to listen to them in 2 CHANNEL AUDIO on your SPDIF output.UPDATE 11/1 - I have been able to get 5.1 Dolby audio from the Netflix app.  However I am still unable to get anything more than 2 channels out on the SPDIF jack when watching an HDMI input source that has 5.1 Dolby.  I have looked into changing the audio settings but the only available option is PCM.  Dolby, DTS are both disabled.If anyone knows how to get 5.1 audio from this TV when watching an HDMI input source using the SPDIR output please let me know.  For now I will have to use an external switch for getting the 5.1 audio to my AVR before I send the signal to the TV.With these expensive TV's it sure would be nice to keep your AVR on one setting (put your remote in the drawer) and use your TV as the master viewing switch.  You can configure the Samsung smart remote to control your AVR volume:) - But you can't control the AVR source selection - so you still have to have a table full of remotes :(Otherwise I am happy with this TV, the picture is great and the apps are useful.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV (really WOW) but very bad foot stand design", "Author": "A.

On Tv 1/4 the screen shows what is on the current channel while around it is what is on other channels or coming up in the next hour - pretty neet stuff. 2. Movies & Tv Show they suggest you click on and pay for to watch - hmm never used this feature. 3. Photos, Videos & Music - My system is set up to receive from my computer so I can big screen my photos from my camera that I downloaded onto my computer - good stuff. 4.Social - This picks up the Your Friends off facebook if they have a youtube video or other video and you can watch it on the TV. Also it has SKYPE which I have not used from my TV. 5. Apps - Now I get to complain. Some apps are locked onto your scrren - you know the ones that cost money to watch (not saying its bad but I wanted to remove some of them)  Netflex, HULU, ShopTV, Amazon, etc. some I want some I would like to remove but can't.  Then there is your choice.couple of hundred choices some free some have cost - you choose what to load and unload to your tv viewing pleasure. The issue is not the program apps though I wish there was even more - but every time the tv upgrades its software it moves all the apps to the buried apps page and you have to go move them back to the front page again. The Tv overall is great - 60 inch at 12 feet away and you can see when the camera mans talent.  If he is not set up just right you can tell.  If your a real tv addict there is like 50 different settings you can change to make your viewing and listening pleasure tuned to you specific needs. Don't forget the internet connection - there is 2 things to check on here 1. speed of internet connection on download - streaming video takes some band width- check and see how much you need, 2. does you service provider charge if you extra if you download a certain amount. say 200gig a month. the overage charges can rack up fast.

The picture is very clear and bright. You can change the quality and brightness to suit you. The standard pic mode did not work well for me however because I found it too dim in most situations.  The sound is pretty good , but not so good that I would give up my sound system ha.  The stand , eh , it's nice looking but you really need a wider than normal tv stand because of the design. I was going to and did mount it on my wall , but I would have preferred a more centralized stand.  The 3d so far is fun and the picture is movie quality in my opinion. I tried out Skype and the camera was super clear and I will use it again for sure.  The smart hub interface is easy to learn and use and I do like the recommendations, even though I do believe it is still learning from what I watch. You tube, netflix, Pandora and more all available and easy to set up and use. The only suggestion would be that the keyboard be easier to use. It does try to predict what you are typing , but for example , when searching on youtube , scrolling through the letters can take a while.  The last thing is the remote. I totally love it. The touch pad is more functional then I read about ,and I have worked out how to draw out numbers on the remote and control my dvr and cable guide. I have almost been able to make it my only used remote.  Oh almost forgot ! Gestures work well and I've had no trouble so far using the motion abilities. The voice however , I have found useless. It has really only done a couple of things I've asked without telling me it was unable to find or do what I was asking. I use voice on my Xbox and phone and don't have troubles.

After going through Samsung's on-screen Universal Remote Setup which had an option for a Bose sound system, I was able to properly sync the TV with the sound system.  The problem is that it only lasts for that session and goes out of sync for every try afterward.  With both the Bose system and Samsung TV off, as soon as I turn hit the power button on my remote, the TV turns on but my sound system turns on, off, on, off, on, off, on, off, on, off...over the first 5-10 seconds, and eventually lands on off, so now I have a TV that's on with a sound system that's off.  Once I hit the power button to turn the TV off, the sound system turns on.  As you can see, the dilemma here is that you can NEVER have the TV and non-Samsung sound system in sync.  Samsung has told me that they are aware of this issue and that they see this issue a lot for non-Samsung sound systems but that they can only guarantee the functionality of Samsung sound systems that are compatible with this TV.  So if you have a Bose, or Sonos, Sony, or other sound system, don't count on it working with this TV as the Universal Remote will control it but you'll likely either be left with video and no sound, or sound and no video.Issue #2:  HBO Go crashes every 20 minutesThis TV has a quad-core processor but the HBO Go app will crash the TV to a point where you have to completely power off and turn back on the TV for anything to work.  It's like a blue screen of death but with a still of the image of where you left off.  I was hoping that I wouldn't have the need to connect my Apple TV here, but I have no choice if I want HBO Go to work on this TV.  Don't ditch your Apple TV, Xbox, PS, or Roku here as SmartHub can't handle HBO Go.Also, the camera and voice recognition are just a gimmick - they cause more interruptions than the functionality they provide.  Just turn them off if you decide to buy this TV.I'm hoping Samsung fixes my 2 primary issues here - I'll update my review if that ever happens.

I am very loyal to Amazon but I was afraid of shipping and what if I don't like it so I just felt more comfortable buying it retail.  I am the biggest critic in the world.  I complain about everything. But this TV is superb. The picture quality is out of this world for the pop and smoothness that is constantly at me.  I never thought I'd buy another LCD /TV again after my Sony XBR4.  After returning that 3 times I had and still have a pioneer 720p which in color accuracy beats anything out even this. That is the Nature of Plasma's. But this TV is much for fun to watch and use !!.  The color is awesome and so are the blacks but nothing will beat a Plasma sorry. Go to any store look at the grass on a golf course via plasma  (I don't care what brand you use with LED) you will see what I'm talking about  the grass is greener with a plasma. With a plasma you don't get that pop in the eye and the ultra smoothness as you get on this set and it's not as sharp.I was in Best Buy for 4 hours in total watching the set.  I didn't have a direct comparison because the 75 inch (F8000) was out which had full array panel. The 55 has edge lit.  I took my cue from the es8000 Samsung (edge lit)  and compared that to the Sony 950 (full array) and the Samsung Blew it away in vibrancy smoothness.  The Sony and even LG. colors a little deeper but the sets is dull.  But trust me with the natural setting at home the color setting is very natural and great and picture is as sharp as a whip and I can't be any happier.  I was up all night watching this thing.Smart tv is very cool but confusing to set up at 4am when Facebook says not connecting to servers. but after 3 hours of sleep I figured out for myself since (tech support was not opened at 6am) that you have to link everything social networks to your Samsung Account.  but stuff like Netflix you just log in.The only thing I am having an issue with (as with all LED's /LCD's but I knew it going in is that the old analog shows such as All in the Family, Emergency, Honeymooners don't look that good. But it's not terrible on this set. The plasma is a big winner in that area but for everything else I can't take my eyes off of it.I recommend this set andTake it from me I return things all the time if I say something is good it's awesome  (Btw I don't see any flashlights):UPDATE:Per request there is a correction I must make.  The TV I saw at Best Buy was a 75 inch un55es8000 Which I was told was a full array.  I am not sure about that since I was researching the un55f8000. At first I was told that 75 in Tv was a UN55F8000 which was the only size that was full Array. When I got yelled at by some people on Amazon I went and double checked. There is no size in the F8000 that is Full Array, but the edgelit I have looks beatifulThe sales clerk was wrong, thus I was wrong based on the info given me.UPDATE 7/23/2013  I'VE BEEN READING AND IT'S TRUE.  I HAVE MY TV HOOOKED UP COMPONANTS TO RECIVER AND THE RECIVER TO THE TV ALL HDMI CHOCOLATE AUDIO QUEST CABLE.  NORMAL TV IS FINE THE AUDIO (AS STATED BY COMCAST COMES IN DIGITAL AUDIO)  Blue Ray IS DTS ETC.BUT BUT BUT YOUR SMART HUB ONLY WORKS IF IT'S HOOKED UP ALL HDMI (AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND)  IN 480P INCLUDING VUDU AND STANDARD DOLBY DIGITAL SOUND.  THOUGH MY BLU RAY PLAYER THE PIC IS 1080P AND DOLBY DIGITAL.I'M STILL HAPPY WITH THE SET BUT MIGHT HAVE LOOKED FOR ANOHTER SET IF I HAD KNOWN THIS.

But if you don't wall mount this TV, be mindful of this.Lets get to the reason why I am sending this TV back... the picture quality is horrendous.  The TV is plagued with frame rate issues and horrendous lag.  I was watching a BluRay (and before you ask it was Skyfall with most up to date software on both the TV and BluRay player) and whenever there was a lot of moving scenes it would get noticeably more choppy than normal and it would actually lag and look like it was skipping.  I know for a fact that it isn't the BluRay disc because it did the exact same thing watching Netflix and Cable HD TV.  I know the LED-LCDs aren't the best in regards to picture quality compared to a Plasma but this was terrible.  It would randomly skip around looking like lag and it would get choppy for no reason.I played around with almost every picture setting the TV has to offer and nothing helped.  I would say that if this was a $800 TV I wouldn't be this upset, but for $2,000 you expect to get something that is top quality.

Both sets were very capable of producing a very high quality image and had great Smart TV features. However, there was an issue I couldn't overlook. I am a photographer and videographer, so picture quality is my life. This TV (both sets) displayed vertical banding (also known as DSE or Dirty Screen Effect). When I watched a scene that was fairly bright, I could notice darker bands of pixels on the screen. This problem showed itself even more when watching Hockey. With the bright background and the fast movement, the issue jumped off the screen and did nothing but annoy me.They say some people are more sensitive to banding/DSE than others, so this TV may work for you. But as a videophile, I don't believe I should have to watch TV as if I'm looking through a dirty windshield on a vehicle.There is a great possibility I received two sets that both had panel issues and that maybe if I had given it a third chance, I might be happy.

The clarity on the smart hub and netflix are visually unsurpassed so we decided to put in 3 movies to test the quality of our new tv.  Terminator 3, Lord of the rings, and the Avengers.  Immediately in terminator 3 my wife and I thought we noticed motion blur in certain scenes, but we ignored it because we thought it was how the movie was made, so we proceeded to put in lord of the rings.  In the very beginning of the movie when the orcs were running toward the elves I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, because I thought I saw motion blur again.  I kept my eyes peeled on everything after that, and in the scene where they were filming the shire I saw the motion blur clear as a day when the hobbit was pushing the wheelbarrow.  Needless to say I was pretty pissed off at that moment and thought the best movie to test for motion blur would be the avengers, because it has the right amount of CG and action scenes.  Surprisingly fast movements and fighting scenes yielded no motion blur, but in parts that moved slowly I could see it clear as day.The whole reason I bought a new TV was because of motion blur, if I'm gonna pay $2700 for a TV I am going to have no motion blur!!,  And in case your wondering, Yes I have a PS3, Yes I am using High Quality HDMI cables and I have put it in Gaming mode which helps but does not eliminate it.  I will not pay this kind of money and have to resort to always making sure I put it on gaming mode first.

However, the picture quality is not as good as Sony.  Since picture quality has a higher factor to me than features, if I had it to do over, I would have purchased a Sony HX instead.  Besides, the cost of memory and code writing these days are relatively cheap.  Yet, comparatively, this TV is quite expensive.  Therefore, you would think the rest of the cost would be in the actual technology of the picture, which is very good, but not on par with Sony's HX series.OK, so I can control the TV by using the remote, hand motion, or by voice.  That's all nice.  But, in the end, it will be the remote.  The other methods are nice novelty features that ultimately wears thin.  However, the remote is not a full remote.  Remaining control comes by way of a on-screen virtual remote, which, again, is cute, but not efficient.  Furthermore, the style of the physical remote is small and slippery.  There is a smart phone apps that controls all the features.  But, even it is divided into three screens and the app often has connectivity issues (at least the iPhone version does).The amount of apps available is crazy.  I'm just waiting for the day I can cancel DirecTV, which leads to RVU connectivity.  It automatically syncs to DirecTV Genie without requiring a STB client.  It even automatically programs the remote to accept DirecTV commands.  The programmable features are just too numerous to mention here.  If features is what you're looking for in a TV, this one is for you!  And, with the available addition of the Evolution Kit, the features will never grow old.However, if you often entertain and have several persons viewing the TV simultaneously, then only the three people looking head-on will get a quality picture.  Anyone viewing from an angle of 45 degrees or more will see a washed out picture.

Of course, Samsung is under no obligation to assist in the repair of my 7000 series, but from a business standpoint, losing a customer who has already purchased (2) of their higher-end models, and the negative publicity I intend to disseminate as a result may make their decision a poor one.

But look at all the bad reviews on their last years \"high end\" model, and maybe you could see just how many issues others are having. When I see a product have as many 1 star reviews as their are, 5 star reviews, I take that as a \"Red flag\". the \"reliability\" on these TVs aren't that great. They really have one of the worst quality controls I've ever experienced. If your looking for a TV to last a couple years, then this may be it. If your looking for a \"reliable\" TV that will last more then 4-5 years with \"NO\" issues, then you may want to look elsewhere. Just read all the reviews from past models. Read the 1 star reviews, and you will see what I mean.http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN55ES8000-55-Inch-1080p-Silver/product-reviews/B00752NJMC/ref=cm_cr_pr_top_link_next_2?ie=UTF8&filterBy;=addOneStar&pageNumber;=2&showViewpoints;=0The \"Smart Evolution Kit\" has been confirmed by Samsung, that it WILL NOT IMPROVE THE PICTURE QUALITY! So please don't buy this TV, just because of this future kit, thinking that every year it will do this. Don't believe others when they say it will. Don't fall for the Hype and Marketing like myself and others did last year. Your better off buying a Blu Ray player or Xbox or something, then spending $300+ on this kit, which seems like its doing the same thing a simple Firmware update can do. Yes, it's a great idea, but not for $300 or $400 as its priced now. Even the Apple TV cost $200-$300 less then this, and the Apple TV IMO, is faster then this Smart Hub is, even though it has a Quad core chip, which is strange, cause you would think this Smart Hub would run faster.Also, I keep hearing that Samsung is getting ready to release their smaller, more affordable 4K \"UltraHD\" TVs. Could they be doing this at the end of next month at the CEA event in NYC? I heard they have a F9000 and F9500 coming out as well. It looks like many may have \"buyers remorse\" and wish they waited, if this does indeed happen next month. I also keep hearing that some of Samsung's TVs are using a \"PenTile\" display. Is this true? No one seems to know exactly which models and sizes use this. I'm shocked that Samsung hasn't mentioned this. I would think that the consumer who buys the product, has the right to know if their TV has a PenTile display, but its been quite the mystery, which makes me wonder why they aren't talking about this. Could this kind of display be cheaper? Could it have a negative effect then the other displays?  I honestly don't know at this point.Edit - 5/1 an article was released stating that SAMSUNG has put 14 MILLION INTO MARKETING THEIR 2013 SMART TVS.  14 million is a lot of money to market TVs. Especially since they are already established in the flat panel market.If they are so good, as some of these 5 star reviews claim, then why would 14 MILLION be needed for marketing?  I would be very wary of 5 star reviews .  Especially since its now known they spent 14 million to M-A-R-K-E-T these TVs.And also, because of the recent investigation, that they paid others to review their competitors products, while rating their own products very high. That alone would turn me off from any brand. IMHO, that's a very dishonest thing to do and they should be ashamed of themselves. This TV is way overpriced! You can buy a TV with the same picture quality for $1,500. For smart features, you can buy something that cost only $99. MY ADVICE, READ THE REVIEWERS COMMENTS along with their review. IMO, it seems that some are trying to bury the truth here, and keep the \"marketing tactics\" ones on the topEdit - 4/16  BREAKING NEWS - The Fair Trade Commission has reportedly launched an investigation into Samsung  on allegations that they are paying people to post negative online comments and reviews about another Manufactures products, while writing 5 star glowing reviews on Samsung's products.Cnet .com posted an article last night if your interested in reading. My point in bringing this up, is because i was just saying the other day that their seems to be way too many glowing 5 star reviews saying their products are perfect and don't have flash-lighting, or clouding, banding, or studder.. And they do! Which makes me me wonder about some of these reviews on Amazon now.i know a few that already are on their 3rd replacement of this TV. So glad I returned mine.EDIT- 4/14Please do your research on these TVs. There are banding reports on the 55\" already. Read the AVforums.com and AVS forums on these and others. There seems to be many \"Glowing\" 5 star reviews that are being made by company PR's. please don't make the same mistakes I made these past 7 years.Last year, before everyone bought one, They promised if we bought these TVs, then next year we will be able to buy this Evolution kit and it will make our TVs have \"Better\" picture quality, and bring our 2012 TV up to the 2013 specs. They made it seem like once you buy these TVs, you won't want to buy a new one for 4-5 years cause this $300 kit will make your TV new every year. Now, they changed it to the \"Smart\" Evolution kit. It wasn't called \"smart\" last year.Everything you get for $300 , except the \"quad core\" processor, can be done with a Firmware update. We the consumers should NOT have to pay $300 for something we can get from a simple S/W update. People are saying that you need a quad core to run this new Smart hub..haha! Then how come the new F6400 and models below have it when those TVs have a dual core? It's all a scam IMO and I hope the \"Attorney Generals\"  and the \"FTC \" do something about all this, cause its all bs IMO.If Sony can add 3D to a 7 year old game console like the PS3 through a Firmware update, without consumers having to go out and buy a new one, then Samsung can give the people the new Smart Hub as well through a simple Firmware update  IMO.Read the Cnet forums on any Apple or Samsung article. You will see all the ones being paid to live on these forums to defend the company everytime  someone posts the \"TRUTH\" about them. Its getting very easy now to notice the ones that are promoting the brand and doing the sales pitch to sell these TVs. Read all the reviews from the past 2012 models.You will read many reports of consumers $3k plasma's screens cracking and Samsung NOT fixing it and blaming it on the consumer. Look up models E8000, D7000, D8000 on here.Please just research before you spend your hard earned money. It's too bad they don't learn from there mistakes from all these years and stop being so greedy and put more money into their quality control and better customer service.I understand they want the most money and profits they can squeeze out of these vendors and customers, but seriously, start caring about your image a little more and your quality control, and fix it already! If Apple can have a good quality control, then there's no excuse why Samsung can't also IMO.Maybe Stop paying so many bloggers and reviewers and PR's to write 5 star glowing reviews on all your products and having them monitor and practicly live on all the forums day and night, and put that money into having a stricter quality control and a better customer service so more of your customers are happy.If others can do it, so can you. You make some of the nicest looking products IMO, and You can be the \"Best\", but your quality control is so bad, that it over shadows your nice looking products. its very bad,  as is your customer service. Maybe start standing by what you make more, cause there are way too many complaints out there saying you didn't stand by your products, and I'm getting tired of reading about so many unhappy consumers.Imagine you saving for months to buy your dream TV that you think is perfect cause of the price you paid, and because of all the paid people writing reviews, to only discover its plagued with very bad vertical banding, to the point when your watching soccer, or any panning scene, your basically watching these thick grey bands the whole time and can't even enjoy your $3k set. People shouldn't have to buy a plasma to avoid this. I don't hear about Sharps 70\" 80\" and 90\" having issues with banding like your 65\" and 75\" do.And your firmware/software and smart hub updates.. Ha! Something very fishy is going on with those IMO. I've watched my sets picture go from amazing, to horrible, back to amazing, to good, then back to amazing and just good again. What's up with that? firmware should not be changing the picture so drastically.  And what about removing settings to control the dimming like shadow detail? Yes! Your firmware wiped out these two settings last March on my ES8000 sets. You removed the Black enhancer setting from the consumers in the UK and now they are forced to use Standard mode, because movie mode has too much clouding and flash-lighting. Why would you remove settings from us that help mask these issues?  We're you that desperate to make your 75\" ES9000 look that much better, or different, so you can charge $10k for it when really its the same exact TV as the $3,500 65\" ES8000? Only difference is the pop up camera and the gold trim and stand. That's it!  So basically you were charging over $7k just for 10\" more of screen size?  GR _ _ _ Y!Once Apples TV comes out, then it may be too lateEdit- 4/11I just thought I should post what this manufacture did to these poor journalists recently.  This is a good enough reason for me to not ever buy another one of their products. Please be careful reading reviews. Don't go by what others say. Look at what else they reviewed and how they reviewed other items to weed out the P.R's  and \"Biased\" ones. Google the model # and manufacture to see what kinds of issues may pop up.. Google \" Samsung bribes bloggers\"  for the article on the Next Web dot com.Watch YouTube videos of the product. ( it may be hard to see any YouTube videos showing problems with this set, as I've heard another owner posted one already and was contacted by Samsung to take it down. If you can afford to buy a new TV every year, then this should NOT matter to you, but if you expect this to last 7-10 years, you may want to do some more research on the net about their reliability. I have had 6 sets go bad either right after the year warranty, or the second year, and a few within warranty. And if you buy any Samsung set, Buy the $99 extended 4 year warranty on .....ORIGINAL REVIEW -The difference of this TV and last years ES8000 seems to be this new model has the settings to control the dimming to mask the clouding and light bleed, and the ES8000 doesn't.  I have a feeling that the ES8000 is capable of and has the hardware to dim just as this new F8000 does. i have a feeling that since the ES \"may\" have the hardware, the only thing missing is the settings to control it.  So what are these settings called? Cinema black and Smart LED.. Every Samsung or Sony that used to use Samsung's panels and is now using LG's this year has a dimming called \"Ce dimming\" this is a dimming that owners of the ES8000 cannot control and it dims the whole screen based on dark scenes. Sometimes even turning off the screen. This is what I think they are calling \"Precision black\" this year. All that is, is Samsung's term for \"Local dimming\" aka CE dimming. Then of course there's the Micro dimming ultimate which dims the zones and is \"software\" based and controllable.When I say software based and controllable, I mean they have control over these zones that dim the picture in the corners to eliminate or mask the light bleed in the corners and clouding which Samsung now says its \"within specs\"  The other thing is the panel that's in my F8000 is the same TS01 panel that's in my ES8000. This means that the only difference between these models is the  \"so called\" quad core processor IMO.So my advise would would be either wait until the price drops on this model, or buy the heavily discounted ES while you still can. I seriously think that the ES is capable of having the cinema black and smart led setting, but Samsung left the settings out, or took them away like they did with the \"Shadow detail\" and \"edge enhancer\" through the very first FW update the ES had back in March last year!  I also find it strange that they removed the \"Black enhancer\" setting from the owners in the UK when they updated the FW on their ES last year.I also think its bizarre how much the picture on my ES has been changing after updating the FW and \"Smart hub\" through out the year I've had it. Its also bizarre how there's never any patch notes on these FW updates. So once you get your TV and it says there's a FW update, you won't be able to find out what its even doing to your $3K TV! Thats strange as even apps on my cell have detailed patch notes.What's also strange to me is when they released the 75\" ES9000 in May, they also released a FW update and a \"Smart hub\" update on the ES and when I updated it, it made my picture look bad. When I say bad, I mean it had clouding and flashlighting that it never had before. Was that done on purpose to make the 75\" ES9000 look like its the \"top\" dog TV?I have owned all Samsung's past years 8000 series and I can say they all seem the same to me. Yea, some have better black levels, but that's because of their dimming going on IMO. Without any of Samsung's mysterious dimming, these TVs will look horrible or just like any other TV on the wall IMO.  Whats interesting is how much control Samsung has over this dimming through FW updates. The ES has had more FW updates then my 2009 iMac! that's just bizarre to me. A TV is not a full computer.. Its a TV! And shouldn't need so many FW updates period!I have before and after pics of my ES from before FW 1046.2 and after FW 1046.2 and you would be shocked to see the difference in what Samsung can do with these FW updates. They shouldn't have control over our TVs like they do. And they certainly shouldn't be taking out settings from owners after they bought the TV. The black enhancer is a setting that's very useful using movie mode. It really helps the clouding and Samsung took it away on the UK owners but left it on the US TVs..Now, I am not saying this is a bad TV, or doesn't have a good picture at all. I'm saying that its not worth over $1K then the ES right now.IMO.  I'm also trying to explain that consumers shouldn't let the marketing tactics get the best of them.So why is the UK version of this TV, NOT getting the \"Smart LED\" setting that this US version has?  Could it be that the people in the UK have a very strict consumers protection law and manufactures can't get away with things they can get away with here?  My honest opinion is, the ES and this F are the same exact TV except for the quad core and the 2 settings I talked about.. Also,  Samsung said last year that if you buy these TVs, you will be able to buy a kit the following year that will make the PICTURE quality even better! And just recently they announced at as \"Smart Evolution Kit\"  Where Before, it was just called \"Evolution kit\"Samsung can easily give last years model the same smart hub that this has through a FW update IMO. No one should need a quad core in this TV. A dual core should be super fast enough. It's all marketing tactics to make more money every year.  whatever you choose, Just please do yourself a huge favor and buy the extended warranty.. Trust me! You need it with these Samsung TVs...FYI, I bought this in the 46\" at a local dealer just to put it side by side with my D8000, ES8000 to see what the differences are, and of course it only looked better when the F8000 had the \"cinema black\" and \"Smart led\" enabled compared to the ES8000 that doesn't have these settings as Sammy either left them out, or took them out through F/W updates..I also noticed that the shadows and details were being crushed with these settings on, so these settings aren't really doing that much to help anyways.This company \"Samsung\" a \"Korean\" company, IMO maybe aren't playing a fair game and is why the Japanese aren't doing so well IMO.. Think about it, When Samsung first became well known, they were a very \"Affordable\" manufacture and now 8 years later, they are still using the same cheap parts in these very expensive TVs and are now charging more then Sonys!  Sony just released the price for its 55\" and 65\" 4K TVs and i cant believe that their 65\" 4K cost less then Samsung's 75\" F8000  that's only 1080p??Edit- the reason for me pointing out this and writing \"Korean\" is because I've been getting comments saying that Samsung isn't Japanese. I have never stated that they were a \"Japanese\" company, but some read it that way so I felt the need to point this out. This has nothing to do with Korean or Japanese and only worded it like this so people understand that Samsung is a \"Korean\" manufacture and \"Sony\" and \"Panasonic\" are a \"Japanese\" manufacture. Again, this has nothing to do with race here.Edit - 3/29Since writing this review i have found out some interesting things. 1) Anyone looking for a very large set that's close to Samsung's 75\" F8000 that cost well over $7K, should look at Sony's new 70\"  \"KDL-70R550A\"  which is starting off at only $2,700. This is $1k less then I paid for my 65\" ES8000 that's plagued with bad \"Vertical Banding\" and cost $3,500 at the time I bought it. It will be very interesting to see if Sonys 65\" \"X900A\" will be able to make this panel with no visible banding under normal viewing, unlike the 65\" Samsung's last year.  It will also be interesting if Samsung's 65\" F8000 is able to pull this off as well, since the 2010 C's and 2011 D's  had issues with the 65\" panel when it came to banding. Last year, the ES8000 came out with \"mostly\" all excellent reviews reviews, until the 65\" sizes started entering consumers homes.If Samsung can pull this off this year and make the 65\" have no visible banding under normal viewing, then that's when I will say this F8000 is an improvement from the ES8000 and up the star here. Otherwise, the 46\" I bought and \"OWNED\" for a day,  was very similar to my 60\" ES8000 that cost $1k less then this F now. Also, people looking to buy the 75\" F8000 or even the 75\" F7100, check out the Sony 65\" X900A that's 4k and cost less then Samsung's 1080p 75\" F8000. I even think the Sony UltraHD 65\" cost around the same as the 75\" F7100. I find it very strange and completely unfair that the 65\" F8000 cost $3,500 and for only 10\" more, you have to pay $4,500 more if you want the 75\" F8000 IMO.  I mean, the 55\" F8000 is only a $800 price difference from the 10\" larger panel 65\" F8000  and the same 10\" jump in size as like the 65\" to the 75\" So why should consumers have to pay over $4,000 if they want to buy the 75\" over the 65\", but not that much if they want the 65\" over the 55\" is very .,,, no comment.  Please don't comment back saying, \"we'll, maybe because its a 75\" panel and bla bla bla, cause look at Sonys new 70\" panel that cost only $2,700.I sure hope Samsung realizes this before they release's the  75\" F7100 and F8000 at those ridiculous prices because that would definitely make others look elsewhere. I think the 65\" F8000 is priced at $3,500 which is still a little high, when you factor in 1080p is going to become less and less popular, once the Chinese brand \"Hisense\" comes out with their 4K UltraHD sets and Vizios 4k sets as well, but $3,500 for the 65\" is much more reasonable compared to their original price last year for the 65\" when it first came out which was over $4k! IMO. The F8000 does seem to be a better built then the ES, and I do love the smaller bezel and the different back on it and all around the frame is very nice indeed, I just wish the prices started out even lower this year since so many others are about to release the newer tech \"UltraHD\" very soon and would hate to see consumers have some major buyers remorse come then when their 15 day return window from BB is up, or their 30 day Amazons is up and now their $3k set cost less then $2k and worth way less then they paid just 2 to 4 months earlier.EDIT - 4/12Attention all Samsung affiliates; I KNOW YOUR READING THESE and I am furious!

After about 4.5 years of very light use (The TV is in my media room and mostly used only when we watched movies), last week, it started displaying overlapping double images on the top quarter of the screen. I requested repair service from Samsung, agreeing to pay the service charge ($70 for visit and diagnosis). Service person came and told me that the LCD panel needs to be replaced. Estimated cost is $1200!!! I called Samsung, explained the situation, and asked their help to mitigate the repair cost. Samsung said \"too bad\". The warranty expired so they won't help. I know the warranty is only 1 year but should I just swallow the fact that the TV I paid a couple of thousand dollars for lasted only 4 years? And repair costs as much as buying a new one? It's ridiculous. As automobile manufactures do for power-train, TV manufacturers should provide longer warranty for the most critical and expensive parts like the LCD panel. I have many Samsung products including another 52-inch Samsung LCD TV, Galaxy Note tablet, smartphone, etc. but I'm done with buying Samsung products, at least Samsung TV's. I'd give a 0 star rating if I could.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor quality and service", "Author": "Grady Parker", "ReviewID": "R39QE7VRSK021V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have  a 67\" Samsung DLP TV that cost $2500 from Costco.
