{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good in some areas ridiculous in others", "Author": "William K", "ReviewID": "R2N71C1RLM8EXL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this tv for about a year and a half. And although the picture and sound are both fairly good, it's really hard to get the picture to go full screen without a lot of hassle. I watch netflix a lot on this tv and every movie and every tv show has to be manually adjusted to fit the screen as each movie and show is different in resolution. There is no auto full screen option and often manually adjusting the picture either makes it come up short of full screen or the picture goes just over the edge of the tv screen enough to keep you from reading some of the captions/titles/names in the shows and movies. So you wind up with about 90 percent of the picture that you wanted to watch. It really does stand out enough to merit a 3 star review on an otherwise 4.5 star tv.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Sanyo Dp47840 47-Inch Class LCD 1080p  60hz Hdtv", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AgwMgrdRL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008HS3JF0"}}
