{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good TV, great gaming monitor", "Author": "Six", "ReviewID": "R2KKWO0D50KEBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw this tv at my local Brandsmart and was impressed; it had perhaps the best picture among standard LED tvs. An LG rep said the LB5800 series use an IPS panel with full array LED backlighting. With help from another Amazon member, we were able to determine the 39\" uses an MVA panel, while the 32\" uses an IPS panel (see comments). On LG's claim of full array LED backlighting, I assume it's valid, perhaps without local dimming as found on the LB6300 series.I wanted a large screen gaming monitor to sit on my desk. This tv is pretty much all screen so no wasted space. Legs are sturdy, metal with plastic finish. Powered off, the screen is dark and not quite glossy but not quite matte. Colors are bright and vibrant, blacks are deep, screen is bright and uniform.As a monitor, the 60hz panel works because input via HDMI from seems limited to 60hz anyway, meaning I could not overclock the 60hz refresh rate using several methods. I suggest not getting hung up on advertised refresh rates though, screen is fast and blurring is minimal even during gaming. TV does have a gaming mode which turns off video processing. While I can't assign a value to input lag, I can say this tv feels more responsive than my old Samsung with no gaming mode. Desktop text is fairly sharp, but doesn't compare to an IPS 1900x1200 monitor.I find these settings optimal for monitor/gaming:backlight = 80contrast = 80brightness = 50color = 50sharpness = 10picture mode = gameenergy saving = offOn general TV functions, menus are easy to navigate, Netflix streaming tuned in at HD with no buffering. Sound is okay, it's bottom firing, with some voice clarity lost behind the screen. Sound bar recommended for best experience. 120 motion index makes movement, especially people moving across screen seem somewhat animated, looks good though.Lastly, LG uses sturdy Styrofoam packing and box material. Box is study, corners hold fast, box center doesn't yield much even with decent pressure applied. Easy assembly and menu config, up and running in under ten minutes.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for...", "Author": "Calvin G", "ReviewID": "R2ZT14BE6GD78Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started out just looking for a tv for my home office. Nothing special, just wanted it to have some basic smart features. I started out a VIZIO 32\" E320I-A0 and was far from satisfied.  Outside of the quality reminding me of some sort of cheap knock off electronic, the interface was slow and horrible. Luckily I came to my senses and decided to spend a little more for this model. The LB5800 is a solid smart LED TV. It looks great, A/V performance is excellent, and feels like it was worth the money. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a under 40in TV.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture, Great Features", "Author": "J", "ReviewID": "R1OEGF9LZ7GET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV! This has a great, clear picture. The other features such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube just add even more bonus to the purchase. I love how I can control YouTube from my phone and send the YouTube video from my phone directly to the TV (via the YouTube app on my phone and on the TV). This makes searching for videos much easier than trying to type with the TV remote.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just as nice as my 42\" LG Smart TV", "Author": "Robert \"Old World Traveler\"", "ReviewID": "RXN598S9UY8EH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is ONE big problem that I ran into.  I ordered the Magic Remote AN-MR400.  This TV is a 2014 TV.  Prior to ordering the Magic Remote I asked a lot of questions and went to the LG website.  I never saw that one must get an MR500 to work with this TV because the MR400 does not.  The MR400 turns the TV on, but there is NO cursor, making the remote useless.  Amazon does not have the MR500 so I have to go to LG for that.  I learned all of this through a long chat with LG.  There is always something that costs you more time and more money.  I should have known better because LG never responded to my questions about the remote, as in \"Does the MR400 work with this TV?\"The MR400 is awesome on my LG 2013 42\" Smart TV.It would be nice if there were more information on such things.

Unfortunately, several of the apps I had planned to use (Dish Network Virtual Joey, Pandora, etc.) are not compatible with this model. Very disappointing that LG would have a current year item that does not play all its 2014 LG Smart World apps. LG's web site also does not provide this information until you have the TV and register for Smart World. In addition, the on-screen registration is tedious and difficult to enter required information.

Customer support thought the screen might have been damaged in shipping, so I ordered a replacement.  The replacement was much worse.  Though the unit appeared fine, when it was plugged in the screen looked all cracked with wild colors -- like it had been hit with a hammer.  Both the original and replacement were shipped in OEM box, with no outer box protection.  I don't know if this is a manufacturing issue or a packaging issue, but LG needs to fix this problem.  In the end, I ended up ordering a different manufacturer's monitor.  On the plus side, Amazon handled the returns with no questions asked, and free one day shipping for the replacement.

So I first bought a TCL 30\" 1080 HD television. However little did I know, words and stats do not mean anything. Apparently HD can be anything from pixelated images to blurry movements. I bought that TV for $289, obviously got what I paid for. So I returned the TV and decided to go with something a little high-end. So as I asked around, the Frys, salesman was really persistent on selling me this particular TV. I thought he was just trying to get commission or something. I asked about refresh rate and how it would affect the TV. He said something like it really doesn't matter, something along those lines. He didn't tell me that low refresh rate would mean laggy picture and blurry fast movements. Hence the fact that 60hz is not well suited for action movies. I hooked up my macbook pro and mirrored my display on the TV and that's when I knew it was the last straw. It may be a small tiny detail but that detail annoyed the **** out of me. The mouse pointer on the TV was lagging behind maybe 1 second or less. I mean I paid $599 for this thing! Why is it laggy, and why are the fast movements blurry!!!I wouldnt recommend this to someone who watches a lot of action movies or if you like to connect your computer and actually know your mouse pointer is moving the exact way you are in real time.However if you want a SMART TV and looking for a large screen with a good size for the price and definition then this may be it for you. Just know any fast pace movies will be affected by the low refresh rates.Overall average tv for the average consumer.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": "Refresh Rate: 60Hz (Native); Motion Clarity Index: 120 (Effective)\nBacklight: LED (Direct LED)\nSmart Functionality: No\nDimensions (W x H x D):  TV without stand: 34.8'' x 20.6\" x 2.2'', TV with stand: 34.8'' x 22.3'' x 8.6''\nInputs: 3 HDMI 1.4, 4 USB 2.0, 1 RF, 1 Component, 1 Composite, 1 Digital Audio Out (optical), 1 PC Audio, 1 LAN, 1 Headphone", "Name": "LG Electronics 39LB5800 39-Inch 1080p 60Hz Smart LED TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rVfVYvLfL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00IGXE7EI"}}
