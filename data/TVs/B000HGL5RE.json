{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrific set", "Author": "Jason Shumate \"jshumate9\"", "ReviewID": "RHKKS7W0AS19J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is really an excellent set.  I have waited a long time to buy my first HDTV and I finally bought this because it had a price I liked and the right features.  I haven't yet been able to test it on a high def picture (that will happen tomorrow), but it's terrific for standard definition.  I have tried it on VCD, Divx, DVD and regular cable and it looks great on all of them.  I do have a few suggestions on how to get the best picture from this set.1) Some will disagree, but if your source is not 16x9 (either anamorphic DVD or widescreen HD broadcasts), you really should watch it in 4:3 mode and not have it needlessly stretch the video to 16:9 mode.  You can change the viewing mode with the remote control.  If you don't like black sidebars on 4:3 viewing and only want to see full screen for everything, don't complain if the stretching makes the imperfections in the original source more apparent.2) Use a component (NOT composite!) output or HDMI output from your DVD player to the TV and set the output on the DVD player to progressive (if it supports it).  My DVD player is a cheap Philips DVP-642 and the output of everything I have tried looks great.  Even low resolution VCD looks really good on this TV.  My DVD player is too old and cheap to support HDMI output, but component output looks great.  I compared S-Video output with component output and component is the way to go.3) Don't sit too close.  My viewing distance is 9 feet and the TV looks great at this distance.  If you sit only 2-3 feet away, imperfections are somewhat more noticeable.  If you are going to sit very close to your TV, you need a smaller screen unless you can live with being able to see every minute imperfection in everything you watch.", "Date": "December 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Can't wait for Wimbledon in HD", "Author": "D. Hicks", "ReviewID": "R7K0TRG0WBMA9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Samsung LNS4096D for about a month.  Lacking previous knowledge or experience with HDTV I researched the subject extensively on the web and in several stores, comparing this model to Sony XBR and others.  The Samsung has met or exceeded my expectations in almost every area.  If I were to make my buying decision today I would again select this model.Pros:  excellent picture quality, connectivity options, swivel is handy.  I was surprised by how good my old $75 DVD player displays, guess it's because it has progressive scan.  Also, concerns about pixel blur with subjects in motion were unfounded.Cons:  sound is somewhat tinny, not same quality as picture - but hooking up an old pair of powered speakers solves the issue for me.There's still a lot I don't know about \"Definition.\"  Some non-HD broadcasts look as good as they do on my older Sony Wega SDTV while others are poor.  And one week an NFL game on an HD channel is crystal clear but the next week it looks like SD.  I switched to Verizon FIOS thinking that an all-digital transmission would make everything look at least as good as the digital content on Comcast's Digital package.  But that has not been the case.  I guess it has to do with the entire video chain, from capture to transmission to display.  And that LCD still has trouble matching SDTV on a CRT set. Hopefully the dissappointing channels/shows will only get better as broadcasters upgrade their technology.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good TV Terrible Service", "Author": "Richard Van Horn", "ReviewID": "R3KGP12XLY0159", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have two words of horror for you, Electronics Expo.  I purchased this set through Amazon, who then relied on Electronics Expo to send the TV.  First off, they sent it via UPS rather than a qualified TV delivery service like Amazon uses.  When I hooked up the TV, the picture worked for 30 seconds then went to a green screen and blinked once in a while.  I called Samsung and they said that they would send someone out in about a week, but if the problem occurred during shipping, the waranty wouldn't cover the repair.  I decided to email Electronics Expo to request a new set and ask for a shipping label.  They emailed me and told me that they wouldn't accept a return of a TV over 20 inches!  I read the return policy and noticed that it only applied to returned items for unwanted items, not defective items.  Electronics Expo then ceased to return my emails.  I called and spoke to a manager who tried telling me that if the item was damaged while shipping, I would have to wait for them to be reimbursed by UPS before my new TV was shipped!  The TV looked great for the 30 seconds that I actually saw a signal, but if this is being shipped by Electronics Expo, play it safe and spend the extra money to buy it elsewhere.", "Date": "March 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Product - Not Great Customer Service", "Author": "Laura L. \"Laura L.\"", "ReviewID": "RYLWYBKVPVX1K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Samsung 40\" LCD model is fantastic.

However there are additional vendors linked up with Amazon that sell this same model and one was being sold for $2,099.99.  Our TV arrived and a month later, I realized that $2,099.99 was charged to our credit card.  After calling Amazon numerous times for assistance and not getting anywhere, we have decided to put the issue to rest.

It's truly amazing!  The picture is crisp and clear.  Movement is fluid and the contrasts are amazing.I was also considering Sony's KDL-40XBR2 but noticed a number of reviews with \"Clouding\" problems.  I went to a local store and noticed \"clouds\" on the Sony in-store display!  I did extensive research between the two TVs and found out that Samsung makes the LCD panel for Sony.  In fact, the LCD panels are exactly the same!  The only differences are Sony's shell and the internal image processing that's driving the display.  Sony must be pushing the LCD backlighting too far and it causes clouds.  A side by side comparison (between the Sony and the Samsung) will reveal Sony has a slightly better contrast but it comes with the chance of clouding.I highly recommend the Samsung.  I bought one and I'm very pleased (and I'm a very picky person).  The bottom line:  Great picture and a great price.

Amazon price was ~$2150 with free shipping and no tax at end of November and is already lower and dropping. The set arrived quickly and with some of the best packing I have ever seen. The picture is excellent, easily in the top level of the many I looked at in local stores. Two hdmi inputs work very well, but if you have Comcast, their Motorola set top does NOT allow hdmi first to your AV receiver and then out to this set, which is very disappointing. You will need to use various cable setups to work around this problem. The onboard audio for this set is nothing special - sounds about the same as all other TV's I have ever had, and WAY below the quality available when you use an AV receiver to process the sound. The controller offers numerous options to adjust picture - convenient when the hdtv channels seem to be all over the map in terms of format (16:9 is not necessarily always being broadcast). All that having been said, it is phenomenal to watch the individual snowflakes falling on Monday Night Football in enough detail to almost count the crystals.

The picture quality is amazingly clear, colors are accurate, blacks are deep, etc, etc.  I paired it up with the new Oppo DV-981HD, which upscales conventional DVDs to 1080p, and movies look phenomenal -- I would highly recommend it as an appropriate accessory (it's only $239 from the manufacturer).  I visisted many electronics stores and the picture looks as good or better than any TV they had on display, the vast majority of which were much more-expensive.If you've been doing research on HDTVs, then you know how rare 1080p in a 40-inch flatscreen is, and how pricey 1080p can be in general.  This TV is the unquestioned best-value for a top of the line HDTV below 50-inches and below 2-grand, bar-none.  I looked around for a long time, both online and offline, and the LN-S4096 fitted all criteria I wanted.  I've got a somewhat tight budget, and don't have an enormous living room (for a gigantic TV) so it made perfect sense for me.  If you need a bigger TV, or price is not an obstacle, then I would say go for a 50 or 60-inch (or a 40-inch Sony Bravia) for 3-5 grand -- picture quality will be just as good.  But, for the price, there's not a better value that doesn't compromise quality -- do yourself a favor and go for it.Like someone else mentioned, the sound is nothing special, but what flatpanel TV puts out great sound?  That would truly be a marvel of engineering lol.  If you're concerned about sound, just buy an HTIB or virtual surround set, and you'll be good to go -- you will need it for ANY flatpanel TV though, so don't base your decision on that.I don't usually write reviews on products that I buy, but I thought that Samsung did a great job with this, and I wanted to let other people know that if you're hesitating for any reason, just take the plunge and you'll be glad that you did", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "All around great TV", "Author": "E.

The picture clarity and deep black definition just did not compare to the other two.The Aquos was decent as well, but when viewing a nature show with high contrast side-by-side with the LNS4096D, it wasn't even a contest.The XBR is the most beautiful TV I've ever seen for less than $5-grand.

Ham", "ReviewID": "RJRGU2IUGMUS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great tv as expected.  I don't know about you guys but buying such an expensive television online (not tangible) made me very nervous.  The price vs. risk/reward was worth it and so far it has worked out perfectly.  I saved 5-600 dollars buying from Amazon over the local CC or BB.  Bought a $80 Peerless mount from Mounts and More, hung it up and it looks incredible.  Standard def programs look very good considering it is a 1080p high def tv trying to process and display a regular crappy cable signal.  I truely believe for the price I paid it is the best bang for the buck in the 40\" lcd category.  I sit approximately 10-16 feet from the set and it is plenty big.  I personally think people are buying much bigger TV than they need, and what they don't realize is that with most HD big screen tv's (40 and up), the picture is pretty fuzzy from close up.  Some of manufacturer's viewing distances are a bit low in my opinion.  If you're getting a 50 or bigger, you better be sitting 15 feet away at the closest spot.  Anyway, this Sammy is really a good piece of work - quick changes between inputs, razor sharp hd picture, nearly equally sharp standard dvd picture(pscan), and very good standard def picture.  Picture and picture is great - I can watch one half from the digi cable box and on the other half is the standard cable picture per a splitter.  It only has 1 tuner but that's all you need for most PIP users.  Remote is good, but I don't use it.  I use my receiver remote that learns keys.  It starts up very quick compared to my dad's lcd rear projection - 3 seconds after hitting the on switch and it is running full blast.  Sad thing is, this review will probably be worthless because this set is almost obsolete since Sammy's new models just came out a month or 2 ago.  But if you can find one I wouldn't hesitate.

I'm not an expert, but the reason why I ultimately chose LCD was largely because my room is very sunny and I have heard that glare can be an issue with plasma sets.Once decided on LCD, my decision-making came down to this set and the Bravia set from Sony.  Both, in my opinion, have outstanding HD images.  The Sony is said to have a bit better HD image, but many complain about Sony's performance with a standard def image.  If you're new to HD (as I was), you'll quickly realize that you'll still end up watching a lot of standard def programming-- so it's important to have a set that performs well on both.As I mentioned, the picture quality is outstanding, especially on channels such as Discovery Channel HD and ESPN.  It can be quite mesmerizing, and the set performs extremely well.  The one downside of this set, as others have mentioned, is its sound performance.  I, as others did, got around this by wiring the sound through my amplifier and then through my stereo speakers-- but if you are unable to do this you may be disappointed with the sound (especially the bass performance).One last caveat on HD, that isn't particular to this set-- you'll end up spending a chunk of money on cables.  An HDMI cable alone can run you $100 easily.  You may want to look for some bargains on the cables (I became impatient and just wanted to get the darned thing to start working).Overall, extremely happy with the set.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Samsung 4096D", "Author": "Warone", "ReviewID": "R1TKFCM7625WH5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this TV in yesterday.

After getting the HDTV receiver, boy was I surprised.  Suddenly, all the normal channels 1-80 look great.  All the HDTV channels look amazing.  No complaints here.  I had been reading all the reviews on the Samsungs and Sony's and Sharps etc.  I spent a week or so comparing the 4065 the 4095/6 and the 4061 and a bunch of others.  I went to Best Buy, Sears, Circuit City and others and stared at all the HD displays.  Finally I found a great review and some guy called Mr. Samsung on CNET forums explained all the differences and likenesses.  I decided on the 4096D.  I got a fantastic deal with free shipping from One Call for around $1800.  I had never done business with them but after researching rip-offs and reviews I went with them.  Customer support was good.  Delivery was great.  This TV Rocks.  Finally I hooked up my Wii with Call of Duty 3 and Wii Sports.  Looks great.  Not fantastic, maybe just a little grainy with CoD3 but I'm completely happy with it.  This is a 40inch screen.  Wii Sports looks excellent. The Wii is not HD so the game resolution isn't Hi Def but is does look very good.  Kids would be totally happy with it.  Adults will be satisfied with the channels, inputs and picture quality.  I highly recommend this TV if you want to save an around 500 hundred bucks then go with this TV and get it from One Call.Oh one more note.  I read a few comments about bars on the side or top on the screen.  Haven't seen those.  Maybe it's the feed or source.

HD channels are very clear but still bars on the top and/or sides. Need to use the zoom picture size to fill whole screen and lose a little of the picture on top/bottom. All these 16:9 TVs seem to do this. The cable guy said it is because this is an 1080p TV and there are no broadcasts in 1080p yet so nothing fits exactly right. I don't know if I believe this. YellowFreight delivery company said I had to stand in my driveway so they could find my house??? He drove right by, then called up my wife and started screaming. I live in a numbered house on a busy road, very, very easy to find, yellowfreight just blows. Yellow also called me to tell me they would not do anything but lift it off the truck, they went out of their way to tell me how bad their service would be, very odd. Can you imaging if UPS or Fedex worked this way?

I've had the TV for a month and I still love it - it is great for playing xbox360 it comes out clean and clear. I like how the base is very stylish, it is also functional as the swivel action really does come in handy.I only ding it a star because it has a huge bunch of unusable features; they really aren't designed to be easy to use and most people won't be using any of the things that samsung went the extra distance to include. I think this tv has some strange internet and photo viewing capability but it doesn;t really seem worth my time to figure it out.

The picture quality is excellent. However, I am afraid I can not say the same thing for everything else.1) The regular Video input is very senstitive to interference. If you run the video cables next to the power cord (bundle together), you will see purple stipes on the TV. After I switched to HDMI cable, no more problem.2) For some reason, it does not allow the user to label the digital channels (analog channels are OK). It becomes very frustrating that you have to remember all the channel numbers.3) The remote controller is the worst. The commonly used buttons such as FAV. CH are small and hard to locate. It is extremely slow and take several seconds to respond to a button push.4) There is one design flaw with this TV.  When a cable card is installed, the fan behind the cable card slot is constantly ON even the TV is OFF. I contacted Samsung.  They initially thought it was a faulty controller board.  After replacing the controller board, the problem is still the same.  I am still waiting for the answer from tech service.In general, I am disappointed with this product even I am happy with the picture quality. It is just not that user-friendly.I also own a Sony KDL-46XBR2 (46\", 1080P). Similar picture quality but much user friendly.
