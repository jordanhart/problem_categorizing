{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Aquos Quality at an Afforable Price", "Author": "Alan Seals", "ReviewID": "R37LMZTYOT81YR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this television for about a month and it has every bit the quality of any Samsung or Sony I have seen in other's home.  Though only Blu-ray now offers 1080P programming (except for some movies on DirectTv) I know more programming is coming so its nice to be prepared.  I don't have a Blu-ray player yet though I have ordered the Denon 2500 BCI.  As far as Aquos Link goes, I don't know if this television has it or not.The remote does not have keys for a DVD-Blu-ray player (one sign it might not) and Sharp told me it doesn't (though they didn't seem sure) but advertisments I seen on other sites says it does.  So I wasn't sure enough of this to order a Sharp Aquos Blu-ray player.  The Denon was a better deal.  Sharp should be clear on this point.  And since Aquos is the high end line of their electronics, shouldn't ALL their televisions have the Aquos Link?Anyway, the television is great.  The stand does require a couple of screws, but setup was fine.  Remote is simple and easy to use.  I would recommend it and I would gladly buy it again.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "SHARP AQUOS LCD tv 46\"", "Author": "Chi N.
