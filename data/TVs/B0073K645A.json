The choice was between this one and a cheaper Panasonic that had lots of good reviews. When I went to the store, I expected to buy the Panasonic, but this one seemed to have a better picture.  The clincher was the sound quality.  This one was much better.  I could actually hear this one, but the other one sounded muddled. Maybe the speakers were blown on the Panasonic, but I couldn't hear it.  Since I have a wood pellet stove, there is a lot of background noise in my living room, so I needed good sound.  This one has some equalizing scheme that allows it to sound better at lower volume. Perhaps Toshiba pumps up the gain on the highs which makes it easier to hear.As for the picture, it is fine.  Not near as bright as my friends TV of the same size that cost over twice as much, but okay for what I want it for, which was primarily to watch netflix at 480P.When you first hook up the tv, it asks you if you want to take it out of \"store mode\"  Which is why it looked so great to start with... I guess it pumps up the brightness, and contrast so it looks great in the store, and makes people want to buy it.It isn't quite as bright as it looked in the store, but it is fine.I don't regret my purchase, and as long as it turns out to be reliable for years to come, I will be satisfied with my purchase.I could use some separate composite inputs.Overall, it is fine.I increased the rating of this TV to 4 stars after I found the following EXTREMELY HELPFUL TIP ON A BEST BUY REVIEW posted by USofANDY.\"The picture looks excellent, however, I did need to make a lot of changes to the menu settings to achieve this - the picture is too dark at default settings but the two key settings to remedy this are the energy saver settings and backlight intensity.Turn off energy saving and crank up the backlight and you have a very bright picture, the remaining settings can be easily calibrated to your preference.Make no mistake, I love the picture quality and the screen itself has low reflection.\"The picture was always nice, but the first thing I noticed was that it was a little dark.  I didn't like it, but could tolerate it.  Turning that energy saving mode off, made a HUGE difference!  Now I have a nice bright picture, which looks much better.I am really glad I found that tip by chance, and I hope you find the tip either on Best Buy, or here on Amazon.That one little tip made me give it another star.  Now I am completely satisfied...James Ruffin Says:\"1. Hit the menu button,2.go to \"preferences\" in the menu3. press the down arrow key to scroll down (the energy settings are sort of hidden at the bottom),3. hit the enter button to select energy savings4.

I have discerning taste, and I can say with a clear conscience that the picture quality of this set is on par with what I've seen from Sony & Samsung. The black is black, the contrast is great, and the colors really pop. It is truly a stunning picture! And completely unexpected from a set of this price range (and brand name).I read reviews that disparaged the sound quality before I received the TV - but I was pleased to learn upon setting it up that the sound quality was fine. It's average, mind you, but not terrible. I have it currently set up in a 14 x 23' carpeted & fully furnished family room and it sounds fine. I just wish it had an \"analog audio-out\" port so I could hook up one of my subwoofers to it.Besides the picture quality, the HDTV antenna reception was an unexpected surprise. It's outstanding! I don't have an antenna connected to the TV, yet it pulls in every local channel that I get on my other LCD TV (that has a highly rated Leaf antenna connected to it)! In fact, this Toshiba TV provides BETTER reception than my other TV. None of the channels \"come in and out.\" They just work, all the time, clear as day, in high def.  Pretty impressive stuff! [In the spirit of full disclosure, my other LCD TV is a few years old and might not have a great tuner. So maybe all LCD TVs have great in-the-box reception these days. Take my feedback for what it's worth.]All in all, I'm very impressed with this set from Toshiba. I never would have purchased one of their sets if I hadn't gotten such a good deal on it, but now I've opened my mind to their TVs. They certainly did a good job with this one! Particularly around the picture quality and over-the-air HDTV reception.Quite impressive for this price range.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am mostly happy with this TV", "Author": "L.

Some frequently used buttons are very tiny and poorly labeled.  The mute only goes to half mute when first pressed.  If I wanted to turn the TV down, I'd turn it down.  I expect the mute button to mute the TV.The large complaint is that the audio is not very bright.  The maximum sound level is barely enough for me to hear over my fan or when I am cooking.  If you like to watch TV loud or if you are putting it in a large room with background noise, you will be disappointed. I am going to have to buy some external speakers.  I am not a gamer and don't care about extra bass--I want a crisper sound in the midrange/human voice levels.  I keep rewinding to hear what is said during movies and dramas when conversations are soft.  News shows and game shows are OK.That said, the picture is very sharp.

I was tossed up between this television, and the Panasonic VIERA TC-L32C3, and picked this. At the time there was a negligible difference in price, under five dollars difference. This was a great deal for a tv that is barely used. The main reason I picked it was the screen the panasonic had was an IPS screen, after looking online, although I had trouble understanding the specs, the info led me to believe this is brighter as it has a different style of screen.(Wikipedia IPS and CCFL) The picture is crisp and sharp and the sound is fine for a bedroom, it is currently more than loud enough On half volume at 10 feet away. The only cons I had was I had to screw the stand on to the television, and the remote feels cheap, although it works well. The USB function does not play video for me so it was essentially useless, and the screen defaulted at 4:3 and I had to set it to 16:9 so the image would fill out the screen. I know I am nitpicking because all the cons with the exception of the remote were easily solved.

I didn't need anything fancy since I use it to watch news/weather/traffic in the morning or as a TV for my daughter to watch cartoons. I am very happy with this Toshiba as it has a good set of inputs, a decent picture, and a reasonable price ($250).Anyone buying this TV should read the review by Mark Fellows. You have to turn off the auto brightness sensor to get a sufficiently bright picture (see instructions below) or keep it in \"retail\" mode. I took off one star for the frustration of trying to find the energy saving options.  Turn off the auto brightness sensor and you'll be more than pleased with the picture quality.How to turn off the auto brightness sensor:1.

We've had it a week and we're pretty happy so far. We bought it in June 2011 at HH Gregg in Myrtle Beach after reading online reviews. Paid $270 inclusive. We'll be using it as our main set in the living room, primarily to watch cable tv. It is comparable to the 27\" tube we had; just wider. If money was no object we might get a slightly larger one but it is adequate for our needs. I have a larger, older projection model I'll be setting up in another room for football.  Picture and sound are both very good for this price point. Sound is not overwhelming but this type tv doesn't have much room for speakers. We live in an older house with a good-sized living room and it's plenty loud. Movies might be a problem since the jacks (\"ports\"?) don't match my old dvd player. There's no yellow jack and hooking yellow to other jacks yields a black&white; picture. Guess we'll have to buy an \"S video\" or \"HDMI\" cable. That's all Greek to me; I'm a Triceratops. But I'm sure something can be worked out. It would be nice if Toshiba had included a manual to explain this sort of thing. As noted elsewhere, it takes its own sweet time changing channels, so if you're a channel-surfer you might want to look elsewhere.I was concerned over reports that models like this one with fluorescent backlighting/edgelighting (as opposed to LED) might be difficult to view from extreme angles off to the sides. I checked this out in the showroom and at home and I don't find this to be a problem at all. Unless I'm standing next to the tv, I can see just fine from any angle or distance.  Setup was pretty easy. The stand screwed right on and I only had to make about four or five choices on the setup menu and the scanning began. About ten minutes later we were watching tv. Five minutes later we had our two universal remotes synched to it. Speaking of remotes, for some reason you have to press the button twice to mute the sound. First push just yields half-mute(?)  We can't speak to durability but I was reassured to find that Toshiba recently merged its LCD screen production with Sony and Hitachi in some sort of Japanese gov't.-sponsored deal. This model comes with a one-year parts & labor manufacturer's warranty.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great balance of economy and quality", "Author": "Lee M. Roller", "ReviewID": "R150LO4JVNZ3Y5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am extremetly happy with this set.  I have had its' 40\" companion model 40E220U in my living room for several months so I already had a pretty good idea what I was getting.  I actually purchaed two of these.  One for the master bedroom and one for a guest room.  I have found this line of Toshiba sets to be affordable with a very good picture once set up properly.For those who have complained about the picture I think it is only fair to point out that the proper settings on ANY television make all the difference.First, as has been mentioned in other reviews, turn off the auto brightness sensor.  Under the preferences menu scroll all the way to the bottom, past the Regza-Link control option to the Energy Savings Settings (this item is scrolled off the bottom of the screen initially  below the Regza-Link option).  Select that item and turn the auto brightness sensor off.  You will immediately see the picture brighten.Next make sure the basic adjustments in the Picture menu are set well.  Go into the Picture menu and try the following range of settings.Set the Picture Mode to 'PREFERENCE' (you probably set it to STANDARD in the initial quick setup)Go into the picture settings and try the following range of values play around with them since there are small varaiances beetween sets and between environments...CONTRAST  90 to 96BACKLIGHT  90 to 96BRIGHTNESS 55 to 58COLOR  45 to 50SHARPNESS  5 to 8As I said, play around with it a bit to suit your room and your taste but I find these settings to be very satisfying and the calibration disk I use bears out that they are as they should be.One other note, you will need to repeat the picture settings for each input.  Antenna, HDMI1, HDMI2, PC...they all have their own settings that the set \"remembers\".  This is good if your cable or satellite box gives a \"hotter\" picture than your DVD, unless of course you are running all your switching through an AVR (which I do in the living room, however  my DirecTV and my BluRay look equally good on the same setting on HDMI1)", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value/Great Television!", "Author": "A.

The speaker sound is as good as to be expected when you don't have a home theatre system set up.  But, this is in a bedroom so the sound is perfect.

For $220 and free shipping, the TV got to my dorm the same day i arrived, and it was not damaged in anyway, (it was fulfillment by Amazon). I read a few reviews previously about this tv and how it has sound problems and doesnt always turn on. All i have to say is that i disagree with everything that read.In my opinion the sound could be better, but it really doesnt matter, i mean if you need it at 87 to hear it perfectly then thats what you leave it at, there is a reason why it can go up to 100. Although i dont even need it to be that high, i actually keep it around 15-18 when going to sleep, so i dont keep anyone up at 3am, and i can hear everything fine. but during the day i usually have it at around 30-40 just because i like my stuff loud. I will say that i actually like the mute button because the first time you press it it only halves your volume. But everyone that is complaining about it needs to chill out, i mean all you have to do is press it two times, i mean your finger is allready on the button, HOW LAZY CAN SOME PEOPLE BE!!!Also, you definetly need to change the brightness settings by taking the energy saver off. it makes an incredible difference to the picture quality. I used to have a vizio which is a great tv and Always has great reviews, and i think that this tv has pretty much the same quality as my other hdtv. so the two things that actually matter about the tv are actually great for the price.The only thing i dont like about this tv is that the remote is retarded, it only has two hdmi ports, and it does not have picture in picture mode. My vizio had it, so i was really bummed that it did not have it on the toshiba. However The tv does have a favorites button which i have never seen before. (in college there is no cable box, so it is cool to have a favorites button on the actual tv itself).I would definetly choose to buy this tv again if i could go back in time.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture; Easy Setup; Perfect First HDTV", "Author": "Vishmandu \"Born To Shop\"", "ReviewID": "R127BG0A8PAORA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our first HDTV and replaces a Toshiba 19\" color CRT TV that's about 15 years old (and still worked as good as new).  We watch TV only for the occasional DVD or national emergency, etc., so our requirements are very low, maybe 1 or 2 DVD's a week, tops.  We just leaned how to stream movies from Youtube and Hulu so we might increase our viewing, but seriously, who has the time?  Anyway this Toshiba HDTV was a super buy from our perspective.  It allows direct hookup of a laptop, and has a USB input, so we can view digital camera photos right off the SD Card; really convenient and absolutely the best way to show photos to friends. The picture looks amazing to us, which you might expect coming from a much older analog CRT display, but we compared this to a Panasonic and a Samsung, which were much more expensive and no better picture.  Another advantage to this relatively smaller screen is the unit can be lifted with one hand.  We store the TV behind an antique Victor crank victrola that sits in front of a picture window, looking out on the Appalachian mountains.  We did not want the TV to spoil the view, so it sits on the floor behind the victrola till needed, then I just lift it off the floor onto the victrola cabinet and we're ready to view.  When done I just put in back on the floor and cover it with the foam dust cover it shipped with.  The poor man's hidden HDTV setup.  I had to rig a strap using two of the wall bracket mounting bolt holes on the back of the unit; no problem.  It's almost too easyWe have a DVD player and a VHS player piggy backed onto the composite video inputs, which seems to work fine.  I used \"Y\" connector RCA plugs, two female in to one male out.  There does not seem to be any loss in picture quality, but we don't have an HDTV DVD player.  It just puts out 480dpi so there's not a lot of HD to be lost.  There really is some advantage to not being spoiled with super high def expectations.  I find the control easy to understand and use, with the most frequent adjustment being for picture size.  This is a button on the control you just keep pushing and it rotates the picture through the various sizing options till you stop at the one you like.  This feature is also nice when displaying digital camera photos.  The sound quality and volume is good.  You may get some buzz with high volume of really dynamic sound, but you can use the audio capability through the RCA connectors and run it to a stereo system.  We haven't found the need.  We sit about 12 feet from the screen in a fairly large room and are delighted with the viewing.  Remember we are coming from a 19-inch CRT, so it doesn't take much to beat that.I'm sure we are using this unit at the lower end of its capabilities, so I am not describing all its more sophisticated features.  HDMI will be used for displaying streaming through a Macbook, but I haven't gotten around to get that implemented.  The signal from my PC laptop through a 20-foot VGA cable is just great, using the VGA input port on the unit and a separate stereo sound patch cord from the headphone output of the laptop to the same connector input on the Toshiba.  You have to tell the TV to use the PC input and analog sound but that is an fairly easy menu access and adjustment.Overall a good TV and a great price.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic no-frills HDTV", "Author": "KaneRobot \"kanerobot\"", "ReviewID": "R3DM2TPX2OPQHU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is right near the top of HDTV's I've seen as far as bang for the buck. While they don't throw in a lot of the bells and whistles (ie built in apps, tons of connection options), I wasn't looking for any of that. I just wanted a bedroom TV that looked good and was affordable. This is about as good as it gets in that regard.While it is only 720p, it is highly unlikely anyone really needs 1080p at a size of 32\". Unless you're sitting with your nose on the screen, there isn't really going to be a difference. Blacks are excellent, very close to LED quality. It even includes a VGA input, which is becoming more and more rare for the less expensive sets. Between 2 HDMIs, one component, one VGA, and the antenna, I'm more than satisfied at this price.TV cosmetically looks fine, no annoying lights while the TV is operating and no ridiculous \"touch of color\" style stuff like you see on Samsungs (nothing against Samsung TVs, but I hate how the ToC style looks).Admittedly the built-in sound is kind of \"meh,\" but again, at this price I'm not expecting theater quality out of my speakers. The built-in speaker is fine for your run of the mill TV watching if you're just watching Simpsons reruns or whatever, but if you're settling in for Game of Thrones or Band of Brothers reruns you're probably going to left wanting if you're just going through the TV speaker.Also, off angles are not the best compared to other recent HDTVs I've seen. They are not awful, but this is something you're going to want to be sitting pretty straight on in front of. Pic begins to look a tad washed out as you move to the left and right.Despite those minor qualms, highest possible recommendation. I'd advise getting the warranty, as due to the low cost of the TV itself, the warranty is very cheap as well (around 30 bucks).Couldn't be happier with this purchase so far (about 2 weeks in)....just be sure to turn off that auto brightness thing (sort of hidden under the energy saver settings in the preferences menu) as soon as you set it up.

At the same time, there was a sale on this 32\" Toshiba, and it was cheaper than the 26\" TVs they were looking at, so they took my 26\" Vizio, and bought this one in replacement.When it came a couple days later, I thought I had finally had my first mess up on Amazon, because the entire box and everything weighed less than the Vizio by itself.  Once I took it out of the box, I noticed that it had roughly the same depth as a typical LCD HDTV, but it was definitely much lighter.  It was a breeze to setup, and I had everything going in about 10 minutes.Pros:-Great picture.  The picture on this Toshiba is much better than I expected for an LCD.  Colors aren't over-saturated like on the Vizio, but yet aren't undersaturated either.  The blacks are very black as well, which surprised me considering it can't reach true black...more on that in a minute.-Like I mentioned before, it is considerably lighter than you would expect.  It's weight makes it a breeze to move around if you need to swap cables, or swap a room around.-REGZA-LINK!  This is an amazing feature that I absolutely love.  Sony and Samsung have technology built into their TVs and Blu-ray players that allows you to control your player with your TV remote.  Toshiba has the same tech in their TVs, but it works with ANY DVD/Blu-ray player connected over HDMI.  That way you only need one remote to change the volume and control your player.  It also recognizes when you turn on your Blu-ray player and switches inputs automatically.-Double Mute.  When you press the mute button, the volume doesn't completely mute, but instead, gets cut in half.Cons:-Only two HDMI ports.  It's understandable on a smaller HDTV, but I did expect for it to have three HDMI ports, so I'll be buying a switcher soon.-The blacks.  The TV is a little dark even with the backlight maxed out, but that's my opinion.  Not too dark where it's like the backlight is dead, but more like \"cinematic\" dark, so the good comes with the bad.-Double Mute.  Though it's a nice feature to have, you have to press the mute button twice to completely mute the TV, and once more to return it back to the previous volume.  I'm sure they could have programmed some sort of time delay so that you could press the mute button again and it return to normal volume.Hogan's Wrap-Up:I have throughly enjoyed this TV.  It is awesome to watch Blu-Rays on (I'm on a HUGE Big Bang Theory kick and I just bought Band of Brothers on Blu-ray to watch again), and my Xbox looks super sharp and crisp.

This was decent for the money, but I had my doubts about longevity and service with an off-brand. The final straw was that I could not get it to work with a universal remote. That's a necessary convenience for me.Next up was an Insignia 40\". It was too big for the space.I tried the Panasonic VIERA TC-L32C5 32-Inch. It was the right size and worked with the universal remote I have, but the picture was only mediocre, and the design very simple. The owners manual consists of 8 pages. For its size, this Panasonic is costly. You pay for the name.That brings me to the Toshiba. The picture is clear and crisp. The manual is 130 pages, showing plenty of features and adjustments. (Get it at [...]%2040E220U%20LCD%20HDTV%20Manual.pdf) The speakers are higher wattage than the Panasonic--10 watts vs 14 watts. The Rezga Link feature of this TV works with my internet enabled Sony Blue-Ray player that I got to watch Amazon Prime. That means the TV remote can control the Blu-ray player.I have had good service with Toshiba products I have purchased in the past, so I'm hoping if I have problems Toshiba will be there.The price here on Amazon beat the sale price for the Panasonic by $40+.So far this looks like a great choice!", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Details....

It forced me to go through several menu steps to get to it- most annoying.)And, this TV's sleep timer has 10-minute increments! I love that. And it goes all the way up to, I think, 6 hours.I typically like to use the sleep timer both at night, for obvious reasons; and in the morning when I am getting ready for work. I like to set it to turn off a few minutes before I need to leave- a helpful reminder to get me out the door on time.Also, I'll add, as another reviewer mentioned- this TV does seem to pick up more OTA broadcast stations than others. My last 2 bedroom TVs did not pick up our local PBS station- despite my trying multiple antennas. This one does.

Vasser", "ReviewID": "R8Z4808MUSVQW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Toshiba model is a \"5 Star Value\" but I'm giving it a 4 star rating because it isn't the very best of the best 32-inch HDTV's out there, but good enough for my needs. Honestly for the money you can not beat this model.I also have the Toshiba 40 inch 1080p version of this same set which is about 9 months old and the great performance I've enjoyed with it is at least part of the reason I decided to go with this 32 inch 720p version for the bedroom.  I already had a ROKU HD box in the bedroom which is also 720p so the two are now working perfectly together.  If I bought a 1080p HDTV I'd feel like I needed to upgrade the ROKU also and thought I'd try this 720p TV instead figuring that really I'm not a big watch TV in bed guy.Before deciding I looked in person at this one and at 1080p 32 inch sets by two other good name brands that cost substantially more.  Really on the 32 inch sets at five feet away the difference between 720p and 1080p didn't make all that much difference and I just didn't see spending so much more money for so little benefit.  This set was to replace a non-HD CRT that was over a decade old so about anything would be an improvement.  If you must have the very best of everything you probably aren't reading reviews for this model anyway because it is not 1080p.Cons:720p not 1080p.  This is a big deal for some people, I found that to me it isn't such a big deal.Large frame around screen so it isn't as compact as other good brands with thin frames that cost a lot more.Remote sort of clunky but functional.Takes about 12 seconds to boot up.Channel changes are not instantaneous but lag about 2 seconds behind pushing the button.2 stage mute.  Push Mute button 1x and volume goes to 50%, push again and it mutes 100%.No WI-FI, SMART TV or built-in DVD/Blu-Ray, just a basic HDTV.Pros:Great picture for 720p with really good colors, no dead or stuck pixels.  Sharper than I expected.Surprisingly robust full range sound with no external sound accessories required.  A real strong point!Audio leveling tames blaring commercials but can be defeated in the setup menu if you want commercials to blare.Cheap!Good brand name.Easy to set up.Really sturdy fixed stand that also is stylish.Versatile compliment of inputs including 2 HDMI, 1 Coax, 1 Component, 1 Computer, 1 USB.Various format sound outputs, more of them than some other budget sets, including Dolby digital.Good build appearance that doesn't look like a cheapie.Low key green pilot light on front isn't overly distracting.No freaky or unpleasant odors.Fairly energy efficient with a $13 sticker on it.200x200 mounting pattern for wall mounts.All programmable & universal remotes (cable/satellite/etc) have TOSHIBA codes.Simple to set variable SLEEP timer.I shopped around quite a bit making lots of comparisons by \"showrooming\" several stores.  I decided on this one and waited for a sale.  Amazon and a local Big Box had the same sale price for President's Day but I went with Amazon because of no sales tax.  That way I could get the extended warranty for about the same cost as the TV alone at the local Big Box.  My only concern then was having to return it if damaged or malfunctioning but I know from experience Amazon is great to worth with on returns.The set arrived on time with my free 2-day Prime Member shipping.  The box had a huge gouge in one side but the TV itself was fine so the box did what it should.  Stand assembly on these takes about 3 minutes or less and requires only a Phillips head screw driver and a smooth flat surface like a bed or sofa where you can lay the display face down with the bottom hanging over the edge in order to attach the stand and secure the 4 included screws.When you first power it up it will boot to a screen that asks you to choose between HOME or RETAIL mode.  I chose HOME and then it did a channel scan which took at least 5 minutes and then was ready to go.I found the tip about turning off the automatic brightness function last summer on these Toshibas.  Turning the auto brightness off does perk up the picture and make the colors vivid.  Turning this feature off makes it look like it does in the store in \"retail\" mode.  Turning off the auto brightness does make the display run at 100% all the time so it uses slightly more energy and I suspect it also may shorten backlight life, but still if you find the picture too dark or colors too dim this is a tip worth trying so I'm repeating it here:1. Press MENU.2. Scroll Right to PREFERENCES.3. Scroll down BEYOND the bottom of the visible menu to find ENERGY SAVING SETTINGS and press enter.4. Press RIGHT control once to turn Auto Brightness Sensor to OFF.5. Press MENU and press Menu a second time to exit menu.  Done.Under PICTURE category in menu settings I suggest you leave the DYNALIGHT function \"ON\" as this is completely different from the Auto Brightness function.  Dynalight improves contrast and it looks slightly better to me with it turned on, which is the default setting.  This is especially true on night scenes or any scene with lots of dark colors such as an old black & white film.Also under the PICTURE category on the main menu I set this one to DYNAMIC mode and it looks great with no other video adjustments at all.  All the video settings were left at the default except I turned the Automatic Brightness off and set the mode to DYNAMIC.Next I adjusted the sound EQ and set the bass to +8 and the treble to +2.  It sounds amazingly good for watching movies or normal TV shows. Dialog is crystal clear and music sounds ok.  Some 32 and even 40 inch TV's have weak sound and leave you wanting more, but both my Toshibas have great sound and don't need any external sound augmentation for normal movies or TV shows.  I think Toshiba's sound is way above average because bad sounding or weak audio is a frequent complaint, even with some other good brand names.I really like this 32 inch HDTV in my bedroom.  I'd buy this exact model again, especially when it is on sale.  I really shopped around and I don't think you can do better with a top name HDTV for the money.  I looked at some cheaper ones too.  I liked this one better than the cheaper ones and better than some of the more expensive ones.  Again my previous good experience with my 40 inch Toshiba weighed heavily in my decision.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Solid Television", "Author": "Thomas Marks", "ReviewID": "R13LAQ9KU13180", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this television for my Wife's craftroom for Christmas.  She didn't want a 1080 HD so I looked through the discounted 720p 32\" LCD televisions.  I had it narrowed down to this Toshiba model and a Samsung.  The Toshiba had several good reviews not only about the picture quality but the sound as well - so I bought it.Other reviewers have commented on the picture quality and what settings to use to get the best picture.  Apparently, it you leave it on an eco power saving setting, the picture looks washed out.  I followed their advice and did get a good picture.  Eventhough this TV is a 720, it does have good color and picture clarity.What I like about this TV is:- It's light weight.  I mounted it on a wall mount that swivels.  I was able to lift it onto the mount very easily.- It has 2 HDMI connections plus several others; I've since plugged my wife's computer into the television and will also connect it to a Directv receiver.- The genaric wall mount fit the TV with no problems.- Amazon discounted this TV to a good price.I really can't think of any negatives so I will recommend this television as a good solid purchase at the discounted price.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quality of Picture Poor", "Author": "Orin W.

The picture quality seems great, and the speakers are decent as well; no distorted sound at normal volume, though I can't say I'm as picky as some about sound.  One odd thing about the sound is that the mute button has to be pressed twice to completely mute it.  The first time it's pressed it turns the volume down halfway, then mutes it completely on the second button press.  This isn't necessarily a con, just out of the ordinary and something to be aware of.A few reviews voiced complaints about the difficulty of assembling the stand, but I personally had no problems there.  I was able to use a small screwdriver on a swiss army knife, although a regular screwdriver with a longer shaft admittedly would have made it easier.  It's possible that they have changed the stand since those reviews were written.This is a pretty basic TV, so there isn't much else I can say about amazing features or anything, other than just about everything works fine and it seems like a good quality device.  Which is exactly why I bought this TV, rather than a cheaper off-brand one.  I personally don't need anything beyond the basics right now, just something that looks good and does the job.  As long as it continues to work well for a long time, I'm happy.  There are just a couple things that could be better.The settings are intuitive and easy to navigate, as are the buttons on the remote.  However, when turning the TV on, it seems to be extremely particular about the vertical and horizontal angle the remote is held at.  I often have to hit the power button several times from different angles before the power light comes on.  I don't have this problem with any other buttons on the remote, even the power button works fine when turning it off, so I'm not entirely sure whether it is just a defect with mine or not.The last issue I had was that the picture was pretty dark out of the box, and it was almost impossible to see images in darker scenes.  Fortunately, this is easily remedied by upping the backlight and turning off the energy savings mode.  A helpful review by Mark Fellows cited another reviewer's explanation of how to do this, so if you are wondering how to change those settings, check that out.  After changing this, I had no complaints about the picture.I would definitely recommend this TV to anyone looking for a good quality device that looks and sounds good, but has few extra features.

After researching both options, I went with the Toshiba that I believed was only 720p capable.It arrived (as always with amazon) right on time at my door on Friday the 4th. Setup was simple - had to attach the stand to the tv itself with a philips head screwdriver. However, the picture out of the box was horrid. I had to go into picture settings and turn Dynalight on, which brightened the picture right up. I also adjusted the tv to the following, to give it more clarity:Contrast 75; Backlight 95; DynaLight On; Brightness 60; Color 70; Tint 0 and Sharpness 15.People looking to buy this for console gaming: When I setup my 360 with the HDMI cord, you have the option to play up to 1080p, which was a complete surprise to me. I had thought this was only a 720p max resolution tv.Audio: Not tinny at all. In my room at night, I had the volume down to 1 and it was still very audible. Between 10-15 volume, I could hear voices and sfx effects about 40' away as clearly as if I was sitting in my bedroom with the TV. I don't believe you can hook up external speakers, but they aren't necessary in a small/medium size bedroom.Viewing: I sit 5' away from the screen when gaming/watching TV in HD (have to pay for high definition channels)and honestly see no difference between the two resolutions. The viewing angles: from the left side, the picture loses it's contrast and is very bright. I suggest staying in front of the TV at least 4' away to see the best results.Overall: TV is an all-around suitor for gamers, people looking to watch sports/casual TV in standard OR high definition, and finally, makes for the perfect PC monitor.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good deal at a great price.", "Author": "cosmo", "ReviewID": "ROSOY64I9UQQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Installed it in my daughters bedroom, didn't send it through a HD comcast box and it works very good.

Over the past few weeks I've been traveling for work, and have encountered about a dozen new tvs of various makes and sizes. The max volume on all of them was not what I would consider loud (not loud enough for everyone in a good-sized conference room to easily hear, for example.) A colleague suggested that they're now being made that way in order to encourage people to buy external speakers.  Maybe so -- but I wonder if it's really because they are using cheaper internal speakers that can't handle what used to be considered a normal loud volume.

The problem can be almost exclusively attributed to Microsoft Windows.  When I connect my Mac to the television over HDMI, the color is just fine.  Windows on the other hand, had a lot of issues with this tv.  When I connected the PC up to it originally (it's a Dell Studio Hybrid running Windows 7 by the way), I had to fumble around with a bunch of settings in Windows just to find a resolution that worked with the TV.  When I finally found one that fit properly and started a movie, I noticed that portions of the picture that were really bright yellow (almost white) actually came out lime green.  After spending an unreasonable amount of time messing with Windows trying to get into advanced video settings I just gave up and used a 3rd party program that let me manually manipulate values in the registry.  Even this didn't work though.  I could make the green go away, but as a result the image was overly dark and difficult to see.  I eventually decided to try it with my old Windows 7 laptop.  Running at the same resolution, I saw the green spots, so I went into the advanced video controls on the laptop (the laptop has a fancy-ish Nvidia video card so I there was a nice Nvidia control panel that gave me options Windows didn't seem to) and found the color panel (I forget exactly what it's called now), one of the settings was to change the color from RGB to YPrPb (or something like that) which fixed the problem with the green spots, but back on the Dell, there was no such option because it has a generic Intel integrated graphics chipset thing.  I finally managed to convince Windows to listen to reason and show me all of the available resolutions (one of which was normal 720p).  Once I changed it to that, the problem went away.  So moral of the story, make sure you have any computer running Windows set to either 720p or 1080p because Windows won't give you any of the options necessary in order to make the color problem go away on other resolutions.Also, for the settings on the TV, I recommend turning the automatic brightness and dynalight settings off, because they're useless.  I don't actually know which one was causing the problem, but whenever I had the fluorescent lights in my dorm room turned on, it looked like the image was flickering.As a final opinion, if you know what you're doing, you have a Mac or Linux machine or are not afraid to show Windows who's boss, and you don't need a whole lot of inputs other than HDMI, this is a great TV.  Once I got past the coloring problem it was smooth sailing, I haven't had to mess with much else since.", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice to see all the action with a great picture as well", "Author": "B. Nelson", "ReviewID": "R195PLE7HFN3TM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is our first LCD flat screen TV, so keeping that in mind here's our review. We've had this TV for approx 6 months and it works wonderfully. In researching these types of TVs I considered the size of our living room and how close we'd be to the device. We have a small living room so a large LCD was not what we wanted, this 32\" size  works well for our needs. We enjoy movies and some broadcast shows, but we didn't want a large TV to dominate the room and thought it'd be like sitting in a front row at the movies, bigger is not always better. Also we are not video addicted to a point that we must have a 1080p over a 720p, in looking at LCD's of each didn't seem to be that much different to me. Also, technology these days upgrades every few months (right now LED's are all the rage) and you never catch up unless you have a bottomless bank account. Toshiba has had consistent good ratings for quality and it was so nice to when Toshiba 32C120U went on sale.The picture is very clear and there is a night and day difference between the old 100 lbs TV's and these, it seems though only a 32\" model the picture is larger than that which is nice. Also, it is great to see all the action as well and especially all the characters with the HD letter box format without that squished down, shrunken picture feeling when watching on a square TV. The audio is average though, as this is not a larger TV and as thin and light as it is there doesn't seem to be much effort by most of these companies put in even above average sound. So if that is important to you or it will be the only sound you'll use for TV viewing, then maybe a bigger model would be better or start saving to add a sound bar or system to it. You of course get a remote and lots of menus to figure in setting up your viewing which is fairly self explanatory. OH, and make sure you know where it is at all time as this model does not have buttons on the actual device, without the remote you don't operate the TV unless you've programed it into another remote, say for Sat dish or cable. We found though that even programmed with the DirectTV remote we still need the Toshiba TV remote to switch to the DVD player and back. We are pleased with the quality and the price of this Toshiba and if you're looking for a smaller size in LCD I would recommend this.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Clear quality of picture and videos", "Author": "Satyanarayan Thakur", "ReviewID": "R2PLKN9QO31JU2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is really good with good. its cool and looks nice. wider viewing experience and good quality of display", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice TV for the price", "Author": "The Saint", "ReviewID": "RUOG8XG50HGDJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good TV for a bedroom or someplace small.

The picture is actually really good considering the limitations of size and resolution. The picture is bright, colors are vibrant, and there are no dead pixels, ghosting, or other artifacts that show up on cheap panels.I took a star off for two things that annoy me, both of which are minor and would not have stopped me from buying it.First, there is lag between changing the channel and the TV responding. I understand digital tuning has lag. I have a bigger, better Toshiba TV in the living room that does not have this issue. Yeah there's a little lag because it is digital, but the big boy TV switches channels twice as fast as this one.Second, like I said, I have a bigger 1080p Toshiba I bought about six years ago before prices came crashing down (if only I had waited four months...). Anyway, in that time, Toshiba STILL can't seem to put a \"dash\" button on the remote. I don't want to enter channel 8, then press the up button to get to 8-1. The cheap Dynex in the bedroom even has this basic feature. I would think that with digital being a requirement in the U.S. now that this would be a standard feature on TVs, but I guess not.Other than that it is a good TV.

No further adjustments on the brightness contrast, backlight , would give much help. That day was cloudy and little light was coming through the near window. I was going to send it back and even got a return RMA shipment tag.  Then the next day I turned on the above lights with a Lumens of 2400. Low and behold..the picture slowly got brighter and brighter where I had to actually turn down the brightness on the TV. I tend to be creative, and I thought if I could get more light into the sensor, (next to the on-off light) it should get even brighter. so I got a little flexible mirror that would re-direct the above lights directly into the sensor. After a few adjustments, again it got even brighter.  So, I wish that a company that installs the light sensor to conserve energy, allow the owner to decide about energy consumption instead of literally forcing it on the consumer.

The only few slight negatives are the lack of a swivel stand, so you have to turn the whole TV (no biggie), and the fact that it probably takes a good 20 seconds to turn on, which is also no big deal (as I said this is a spare TV).

However, my sister will be using her Philips CSS2123B/F7 'soundbar with the subwoofer' system to take care of the audio duties for this TV. Philips is a killer system and a way better audio device than any built-in TV speaker by a far margin and for so little money to boot. I got the Philips soundbar system for $89 on sale last Christmas, but not here on Amazon.Now, let's talk about this Toshiba. The Toshiba really shines in the picture quality department, but you must turn off that dreadful 'Energy Saving' thing in the 'Preferences' because it dims the picture way too much. Picture tweaking over several days with different program material will further improve the picture quality and you can really tune the picture of this TV to your personal taste. The only caveat is that you only have one custom preset on this TV so you will be a bit challenged to find a happy medium for all your devices connected to it, but it is doable and my sister loves the picture from all sources.Also, if you are not buying any external speakers, make sure you are getting the best possible sound out of its built-in speakers because that is definitely possible. Go into the TV's AUDIO settings and change the default setting from 'Dolby Digital to 'PCM'. The 'PCM' setting will give you the clear, dynamic and uncompressed stereo audio from your TV's speakers and the sound will be much improved over the default 'Dolby Digital' setting. Just remember that Dolby Digital is always compressed and that's why PCM mode sounds better with those tiny TV speakers.

It seems comparable to any other budget 32\" flatscreen TV.  The biggest flaw, for me, was that the remote would operate my Rabbit Air MinusA2 (model SPA-700A covers 700 sq. ft.) Ultra-Quiet Air Purifier - Stylish, Efficient and Energy Star\u00ae Certified, Wall-Mountable!, White, Pet Allegy whenever I used the number buttons or the up/down navigation buttons.  It would turn on/off, change the speed, change the mood light, make it make sounds, etc.  It was meant to be a bedroom TV and that's where the air purifier lives.  I tried covering the IR sensor with a piece of tape, but it turns out the IR sensor was used as an ambient light sensor, which means that if the purifier was in \"automatic\" mode, which is where I keep it most of the time, it would shut off within 5 minutes of covering the sensor, which is what you want if you're trying to sleep.The second major flaw (for me) was that after putting it up my wife reallllly wanted it to be as close to the wall as possible, but the cable connections are on the back, oriented towards the wall, so right angle adapters would need to be bought (not available locally), and it would still be very awkward.Instead I bought a VIZIO E321VT 32-Inch 720p 60Hz LED-Lit TV for the same price ($250) locally, which doesn't have a remote that makes my air purifier go crazy and has the connections facing downwards and to the side, which makes it easier to mount flush to the wall.

I ordered this TV and had this unrealistic expectation that it would operate when I took it out of the box. It did NOT. The remote initially could not turn on the TV, and when it did, it would sporadically bring up the screens to set up the TV. When set up screens did come up, some times it would time 3 or 5 minutes for the TV to respond. After about an hour of the TV not responding to set up efforts, I contacted Toshiba Custormer Service. After 30 minutes on the phone with the Customer Service Rep, he wasn't sure it was the remote or TV. After trying the batteries that came with the remote and my own new batteries, the problems did not go away. He suggested ME not him, going online to order a new remote that would take about 5 days to get, and if that didn't work, a tech would come to my home. When I talked with the Customer Service Supervisor in Asia, he suggested I go online to order a new remote that would take 4 or 5 days to get. I asked why I couldn't go to a local dealer to get a remote and that wasn't an option. When I asked why Customer Service could not go online and order the remote for me. According to him, that wasn't an option. I told him his options were NOT an option for me. Toshiba in the future is NOT a selection for me. Now you know why I say run or run faster from this TV.The best part about this experience is how well Amazon handled the process of me returning the TV.
