{"Reviews": [{"Title": "top of the line, unbelievable.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3VG9EE9MX602Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV 2 months ago (9/2008) from a local store.  This TV is hands down the best TV on the market!  5 stars.  I haven't found a single thing that I don't like about it.It is hard to put into words how much better this TV was compared to every other TV in the store.  The picture is bright and crisp. Hands down had the best picture in the store...  Why? Bright Colors and a million shades of black.There are so many more shades of grey and black that you'll see on this TV that you won't see on another TV until they are side by side and you see what you're missing.  One of my all time favorite movies is Apocalypse Now.  When you watch a movie like Apocalypse Now that has a lot of night scenes, you'll notice so much more detail because it doesn't come up as just black.  You'll see the water move, you'll see the detail in the dirt...  There are all these details that you never saw on a regular TV (or older plasma for that matter).If you look at my other reviews, you'll see that I have a Samsung LCD TV that I reviewed a year ago.  That is a great TV that hangs in front of the treadmill.  The samsung is great where it is and is just fine for watch the evening news or for watching 30 Rock.  But if you want to see the details in movies, you need to get a KURO.  The KURO blows that TV out of the water for picture quality and for sound.  There is a big price difference, but you'll see the difference in the picture!***  Additional comments on the picture***  I watched the final table on ESPN the other night on my Samsung LCD.  On that TV the Phillips fan in white t-shirts were all blued out because of the black lights and you can't make out the people at all.  I just flipped the channels and see that on the KURO, they aren't blued out and you can see all them and make them out.  Truly amazing.  I don't know how much of this is because of Time Warner HD or the TV set, but there is a remarkable difference.Another thing that I've really noticed is that text is so much cleaner and the lines of the text are perfect.  There is so much difference it's hard to put it into words.This is an expensive TV, but you wouldn't be reading this if you weren't interested in buying it.  So, if you have the money, this is the TV that you'll want to buy.  The picture will blow you away.I keep editing and adding to this review because I keep finding more and more things that I really like.  I've talked about the picture, but the sound is truly amazing for a TV.  You can watch any action movie and use the TV speakers and you won't be disappointed.  I have mine hooked up to a Denon 4308 amp and 6 Klipsch speakers and the sound system is great.  BUT HONESTELY, YOU COULD ENJOY ANY ACTION MOVIE WITHOUT THIS SETUP.  The dialog is crisp and has more bass than not expected.  You could very easily get a silimar effect by getting a small subwoofer and connecting directly to the back of the TV.  Overall, the sound on this set is very good for a TV.Options-  This TV is loaded with customization and options.  If you're like me and want to have the adjustments to get things just right, you're going to appreciate the many ways you can adjust the picture and sound.To wrap it up-~The best picture possible~Great sound right from the included speakers~Lots of options and the ability to customize all aspects of the picture and sound", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Hands down the best TV out there right now!", "Author": "GErianne", "ReviewID": "R2FZUYYVL610W1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Pro-111FD Kuro ('black') certainly lives up to its name. It produces jaw-dropping, deep blacks that make its true-to-life colors look all the more beautiful and stunning. The wide range of user-selectable as well as automatic features that protect it from 'burn-in', largely eliminated this as a concern for me about buying a plasma TV. The Energy Save feature of this TV also reduces the long-standing concern over the cost of operating a plasma TV.The picture is as bright as it is beautiful, putting it on a par with some LCDs for brightness. The user-selectable automatic light sensor and automatic color sensor work well to automatically adjust the picture brightness/color for different room lighting conditions.Sound output from the (optionally) side-mounted speakers is excellent, with automatic as well as user-cusomizable settings to adjust the sound for a wide variety of tastes and environments.There are 4 HDMI input terminals and other outputs, as well as a USB port, Ehternet cable port, and PC input terminal that provided me with a wide range of interconnection possibilities for my home theater set up - with lots of expandability left over.The seven AV settings (picture presets), except for Optimized, can be customized. There are two 'hidden' modes, ISF-Day and ISF-Night, that will appear if this TV is calibrated through the service menus, and can be locked so the settings can't be changed without accessing the service menu again. Although the Standard AV setting is the only one that can be customized for EACH input (cable, satellite, DVD, BluRay), the other customizable settings that are shared between inputs provide enough versatility to support most tastes - or needs.Buttons on the remote are somewhat small and some are not backlit, making selection in a dark environment less friendly than it could be. On the plus side, the remote is comfortable in the hand and can be programmed to operate a variety of devices using codes (provided in the User's Guide) or via a learning mode.This Pioneer Elite is truly a class act. Even the User's Manual, with it's glossy, deep black cover, smacks of class! The absolutely stunning picture on this TV vastly outweighs any minor shortcomings this plasma TV may have. In short, if you love home theater, movies, and watching high def TV, give this Kuro very, VERY serious consideration. It is, without a doubt, worth the price. I have absolutely no regrets about purchasing this fantastic TV and would recommend it to anyone - in a heartbeat!", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "All HDTVS will be measured to this mighty Pioneer KURO!", "Author": "Porfie Medina \"Porfie Jr. Medina\"", "ReviewID": "R2S1LJRJ6Y1DER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Pioneer Pro 111-FD a little over a week ago and I absolutely love it. I am pretty familiar with HDTVs since I purchased my first 1080p TV in October of 2006. I am upgrading from a SONY 46 inch XBR3 LCD which I also loved. The colors on that TV would just pop out and the sound was great as well. There were a few things about that TV (and many others on the market today) that I could just not get past and that was the black level. My old SONY LCD was top of the line and had better blacks than most TVs even on the market today, but once I saw the Pioneer TV at a magnolia Best Buy I was blown away at how black the blacks were. I mean the blacks on the TV are like no other, and no plasma, LCD, or even LCD with LED lighting can compare to this Pioneers amazing black level especially when viewing from any angle. The colors look more realistic and no so cartoonish and fake. I have been accused of being a huge SONY fan boy and some people even accused me of working for SONY because of the TV review I did for my old TV here on amazon in late 2006. I have always loved Sony products, but lately I have been disappointed with the direction (greed) Sony is going in. I never thought I would purchase a TV other than SONY, but seeing is believing and this PIONEER Kuro pro 111-fd is the best looking and most highly rated HDTV on the market today and I researched this for months. I also loved the fact that unlike my LCD the colors don't get washed out of foggy like when you're watching it from an angle or not directly front and center. Even though I am familer with HDTV I am new to the whole plasma scene and was concerned about plasmas not performing good in high elevation and the risk of burn in. I can assure you I have NO problem with this TV working here in Colorado or image burn in. I did do a 150 hour break in process to evenly wear out the TV pixels. They say the first 100-200 hours are the most vulnerable for plasmas that's why the recommend the break in process and watching only material that feels the entire screen to break in the plasma properly. After the break in process you are good to watch whatever you want. I love the 24fps that my previous TV never had. I also love the 4 position Split Screen picture in picture which lets you watch 2 things at the same time such as a blu-ray movie, and a TV show. You can also change the picture in picture to a little window instead and position it in any of the 4 corners of the screen. One other thing that stands out for me is the sound this TV gives out which is amazing and the best I have ever heard on a TV. I highly encourage anyone who has or plans to get this tv to Google \"Pioneer Pro 111fd break in process\" to get more info on how to properly break in this TV. I highly recommend this amazing HDTV. Sadly this will be the last generation of Kuro TVS that Pioneer will ever produce, but they are going out on top and with a bang.

Green", "ReviewID": "R3KC4Z0W0AY8DI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is easy to find detailed reviews of the Pioneer Elite PRO-111FD on the internet.  However, nothing beats a careful comparison in an high-quality electronics store of this set with ostensibly comparable models from other manufacturers.  In particular, go to an electronics store where you can spend time watching some of the programs that you normally watch.  If you like sports, watch some golf, baseball or something shot outdoors to see how realistic the color of the grass is on the 111FD compared to a highly rated Samsung or Sony, which make grass look like artificial turf.  Then, or if it's all you can do, compare the skin tones as rendered on the 111FD to those on competing televisions.  I had a highly rated Samsung (which by technical measures was on par with this Pioneer), and despite every conceivable adjustment, the skin tones were horrible, while a minimal amount of adjustment of the 111FD has given me a picture that is virtually perfect.  This set is a pleasure to watch every time you turn it on.It is nearly five years since I wrote the preceding review, and 5 and 1/2 years since I purchased the Pioneer Elite PRO-111FD.  I am pleased to say that the set continues to work perfectly, providing remarkably realistic colors, and free of any faults.  Unfortunately, not enough people valued the quality of the images they spend hours a week (or a day) staring at for Pioneer to be able to continue to produce these sets.  If you can find one used, you are likely to have to pay significantly more than the price of a new Samsung LED or Panasonic plasma, but you will be buying the best TV available (assuming you can find one).  I've waited for Samsung, Sony, Panasonic and others to achieve the picture quality that Pioneer achieved six years ago.  I have no doubt that they could do it, but they don't because they would have to sell a 50 inch set for $5,000.  That doesn't work when the 50 inch LED set next to it is $500.  When consumers don't understand what they are buying, they opt for what is cheaper.  But, life is short.  If you're going to watch anything on a TV, try to find a Pioneer Elite that is five or more years old.  Otherwise (and perhaps better) get a library card, and spend your money on a comfortable chair and a good reading light.", "Date": "December 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "Funkster", "ReviewID": "R213YHOKU3MT0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had this TV for a few weeks now.  I researched the entire Samsung LCD and Plasma line, looked at the XBRs from Sony and some of the higher end Panasonic plasmas.I used 12 criteria to evaluate each of the 16 TVs I looked at.Kuro Elite was best in class in every category except for vibrancy and SD picture blur reduction. LCDs are clearly more vibrant. If you are looking for a picture that immediately jumps out at you and demands your attention, you're unlikely to find it in this TV. I much prefer realistic looking scenes (I'm also a photographer), so it's very important to me to have an image that is a reproduction of the original with the least amount of alteration.  That is indeed exactly what the Elite delivers. The Samsungs have some post-processing that allow you to reduce the blur/hard-edges on a SD (standard defn.) source. Since I watch mainly Bluray, do HD gaming and cable, this isn't important to me.The Elite won out in all the other 10 criteria (I did not evaluate native sound, since I use external surround sound).So if you want completely realistic video/images with incredible crispness and black levels that you don't even notice after a while, because they are so darn good, this is the perfect TV for you!", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best TV I have ever seen!", "Author": "S.

My Sony Bravia XBR was one of the best when I bought that 2 years ago. This Pioneer makes the Sony look very average. I have read alot of articles naming this tv one of the best on the market and from what I have seen there is alot backing it up.The picture looks great straight out of the box. No picture or color adjustment required like some of my past TVs. The TV is also surprising slim for such a big set.One thing I do wish was better is the look of the menus. The layout is fine but the look of it is a little dull and plain. I think for the price point of this they should have something a little fancier.

The Samsung did not overscan though. The Samsung was top rated by consumer reports. geesh- its not even in the same league!!After I saw the elite, the Samsung went right back to Amazon. Amazon took the Samsung back, and refunded my money, in full, including shipping both ways.  Amazon gets 5 very solid stars.The Pioneer seems to run cooler than the Samsung-even with the power save function turned off on the pioneer.There are annoyances with the pioneer but I still have no regrets.The Samsung had better HDMI control functionality:If you turned on the blu-ray player, the Samsung would automatically turn on and the change input to the player! I miss that.The Samsung allows HDMI control for EACH HDMI input. With the Pioneer, you have to go to setup and choose a SINGLE input.The pioneer HDMI control is really lame. The HDMI control worked fine with my Panasonic blu ray and the Samsung (except the pause button.) It is flaky and thus unusable with the Pioneer. Tech support said that HDMI is flaky and not a good standard. geesh. Pass the buck!I miss the swivel stand too.The Samsung remote was bigger and more usable in darkness.The pioneer remote is difficult in darkness.The Home Media Gallery is not much more than a curiosity to me, even after I setup a freeware DNA server for it.Just too inflexible and I am spoiled by having an XP box plugged in to it with Bluetooth mouse and keyboard. I would have traded the HMG for the swivel stand.The included speakers are awesome for tv speakers-too bad I am not using them.I am just whining because the picture quality more than makes up for the relatively petty grievances.Turning off the orbiter to avoid the over scan is scary, especially when connecting to the PC.So here is what I did to the:1. Auto hide task bar.2. Set screen saver to 2 minutes.3. Set desktop to Grey (18% or so)I hope this is sufficient.I like to view my photos on it.BTW, the person complaining about the grey bars on the side during 4:3 viewing should know that you can turn them off or darken them a little.

Perlo", "ReviewID": "RTEE1RI5WUXWJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded from a Samsung 61\" LED DLP which wasn't too shabby.  I spent a good 3 or 4 months crawling around various electronic stores in Manhattan comparing models and was finally able to hunt down a Pioneer Elite Kuro PRO-111FD at an insanely low price ($2499).  I've spent a little over a week with the TV and have to say that it really lives up to all the lofty praise it has received over the past year.  The blacks, in a single word, are stunning and the colors are equally impressive.  Last weekend I fired up my PS3 and watched the Criterion Collection version of Chung King Express and was blown away by the clarity and color depth.  HDTV, especially programs broadcast in 1080i, are also excellent.  I have mixed opinions about SD content on the TV (sometimes it looks great, other times not at all) but I can't offer an objective opinion because my AVR (Pioneer Elite SC-05) handles the processing and upconversion for those signals.I still have a lot to explore (namely the 24p 72hz film mode) but can safely say that this is the best TV on the market.  But keep in mind that there are plenty of other options that are just as drool-worthy.  Namely the LED backlit Samsungs (A950 series) and the Sony XBR8s.  And in terms of aesthetics, the new LED edge-lit Samsungs are beyond chic...you deserve to see how slim they are in person.  The new Panasonic G10s also look great and couldn't have a more seductive price.

The first thing I have to say is WOW! what a phenomenal detailed, colorful and accurate picture. Blackest blacks, most colorful colors, & super fine detail. The features are mind blowing too!I have been following the Kuro line since the day it was announced as being introduced to the market. I read, dreamed & drooled over what I saw and read. One thing that floored me was the prices! They were astronomical. I knew PIONEER was getting things right from the information I gathered over the years but those prices singled me out as a potential buyer. After reading & wanting one for many years, I sort of forgot about them or owning one due to lack of funds for a few years. Then just this year I reached a point I could afford one and was hoping I could find one available either new or stightly used.Was able to procure one at the small price of $1800 a new showroom display model with full warranty.For the last three years I was using a really old PIONEER V402 4:3 Full Screen monitor for all my viewing purposes.Were talking around second generation plasma here! I bought it used for $400 and surely got my money out of it for what it is, and was my first introduction to owning a plasma. The original price of that commercial version was $15,000 and was only capable of 480p at best.I went from that to the Pro-111 so the difference was night & day to say the least.Even Laserdisc & VHS viewing is great on this thing although nowhere near DVD @1080p they still look better than  older CRT's. But of course DVD 1080p is where it's at on this set. I don't care for TV so I don't view HDTV, but thats all been covered here for the most part.I have been everywhere I could think of over the years viewing, comparing TV's & monitors wanting to get the best bang for my buck. Talking with knowledgeable sales reps when they could be found as if I was going to buy that day, viewing instore sets displaying, HDTV, DVD, BluRay, Xbox, PS3, etc.. to educate myself on what I really wanted in a monitor. Not just settle for some descent set that could display my video sources in a mediocre fashion.I am glad I held out over the years, for what I really wanted, it was worth it. I got a bargain price and like many have stated on the web there is nothing out to date that can top the last PIONEER plasmas.Although they may be toppled from their throne someday I WON'T be running out to purchase the newest set boasting better blacks & picture over the PIONEER's.This is the first for me running 1080p DVD movies & Xbox 360 personally, before only viewing it in stores or other people's homes. After viewing movies like the Matrix, the Green Mile, and so on it was so obvious my previous plasma was so outdated. Along with that I have never witnessed such vivid movie viewing on anyone else's set I have ever seen before.Just recently I purchased a PS3 first generation console. So Blu-Ray is coming into play on this fabulous monitor.I cannot tell you how awe striking a quality Blu-Ray transfer looks on the Pro-111. It's downright jaw dropping, awe inspiring, glorious beauty! Avatar said to be the pinnacle demo disc (and it is!) is unreal, along with the likes of Gamer, Watchmen, Stealth, Law Abiding Citizen, Up, The Dark Knight, even the Searchers just to name a few. It's like seeing movies in a theater only better!Everytime I turn on this set it just knocks me out just how great the picture can be.Xbox 360 games are just phenomenal!It's still in the break-in period and I am running various programs suited for plasma break-in so it's only going to get better!Everyone has been sucked into the marketing machine by many manufactures & stores namely Sony and Walmart that you can get a great 720p LCD for under $700 or a 1080i for around $900. Although this may be somewhat true PIONEER plasmas will knock them out of the ballpark everytime. Sadly many have abandoned the plasma market in favor of LCD because they sell like hotcakes.I have been convinced that plasma was the way to go since day one but always tried to give LCD an unbiased chance.LCD in my opinion is an epic failure compared to the likes of PIONEER's last 9th gen. plasmas. Of course everyone is going to have their own personal tastes in what they are looking for in a displays picture.Its really disappointing that PIONEER bailed from plasma production. Just as they were at the head of the class and were only going to get better at what they do, sad indeed!You will do yourself a big favor if you do some research, if you want the best and can find a Pro-111 50\" or a Pro-151 60\" get one while you can! You won't regret it. Prices are getting really reasonable but availablity may get scarce after awhile since PIONEER no longer makes these.I won't go into the specs as they are well listed here.You just have to see one for yourself to really get the full impact of what everyone is writing about these.Otherwise you fall prey to the marketing machine and Walmart's LCD for $500 on Black Friday are just as good, NOT EVEN CLOSE!Most people I talk to have no clue what a Kuro is, they just turn their head sideways like a dog hearing a strange sound. They just don't know how PIONEER ruled the plasma market for a time.Bottom line as it always has been, 'You get what you pay for!'Kuro Lives!", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best TV", "Author": "M.

I was somewhat hesitant about buying this product as Pioneer is no longer going to be making them, as I understand it.  But after all the research and the price coming down to $2,800 I had to go for it.  I love the picture.  A negative reviewer wrote about bars on the side, mine automatically scales a 4:3 to 16:9 and it looks pretty good. Sure, when all broadcasts go to the wider format it will be even better but there are a lot more widescreen HD channels now.  By the by, this TV is incredible coupled with a Blue Ray player.  I bought a basic Sony stand alone and everything looks fantastic.  I'm glad I took the plunge. As for the reviewer who didn't like the clock, my advice is to buy a watch and enjoy the TV.", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lots of money for a bad clock", "Author": "A.

Lots of imputs, lots of settings available and good sound.However some have some minor problems that shouldn't exist at the price of these beasts. Mine has the following problems:1. The clock is one hour out for the time zone and there is no way to adjust the time.2. The DST time function doesn't change the time. Even over a weekend.3. When watching standard definition images the bars on the side of the image are almost white when the manual say they should be grey or dark grey.This was reported almost two months ago and Pioneer still have no fix.If these are minor issues for you it's a great TV but I'm not happy as these problems shouldn't exist at this cost.", "Date": "November 19, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001CE06GQ"}}
