I'm lucky (or unlucky) enough that I got this television as a gift, so at least I didn't have to waste my well earned $150 bucks on it. Simply put, this television is terrible!!!General Issues:TERRIBLE VIEWING ANGLE- the only way you can see the picture is if you're looking straight on directly at the television at eye level. I have it in my bedroom on a table, and I can't lie down or sit in a chair off to the side of it because the picture goes COMPLETELY blackPOOR SOUND- the highest level volume still isn't enough for me to hear the dialogue if I have my window open or my bedroom fan onProblem with my unit:I had installed a digital antenna to pick up local stations, but tried to attach it to my cable the other day. My cable wasn't working so I decided to plug the antenna back in for the meantime, and now it doesn't work! The TV won't pick up ANY channels, can't get any help from the company and am completely s.o.l. Now it's basically a glorified 'not so portable' DVD player. It's completely useless- I can't wait until I can buy a new TV.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dead after four months", "Author": "Stephen D.

However, the picture started freezing this week, and now it doesn't get any channels at all.  It may be under warranty, I'll check.

I got one for the kitchen, then another 2 for bedrooms.Only problem I've had with any of the 3 so far, is after I used one as a computer monitor, the color never came back in right, for the TV mode.  I'm getting a lot of red blotches on the tv mode, for the one I used as a monitor.As long as you never use them for computer monitors, they are really good little tv's.  Great for a small room.I also can't find any specs anywhere for wall mounting.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money", "Author": "A.

We contacted the manufacturer, who took two weeks to return our email but could not resolve the problem.  Then we tried to send the unit back to the Amazon seller, Ocean Reef Electronics, who refused to take it back because it had been just over 30 days.  We should have checked out the seller first, who has a terrible reputation (complaints on RipoffReport.com, etc).  We're surprised and disappointed that Amazon would allow this type of seller to do business through their website.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "15\" Inch HD TV and Monitor", "Author": "Best Value", "ReviewID": "RQNAAV4CQI5YH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Out of Box this unit provided instant resultsNeeded HDMI inputs and it had want i needed.didn't care about the sound because we are using head phones forthis application.Works great, thanks", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Renny", "ReviewID": "R2HQ6F2Q0UUQ9F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little tv for the price!

However, it is unwatchable because it turns itself off and on constantly. and when I say off, I mean no juice whatsoever.I am hoping it is the adapter, I have not tried to replace that yet.

Requested a return through Amazon, received a reply from the seller within a few hours with return information.  The seller stated in that reply that they do not offer exchanges, just returns and then you have to re order.  Considering that they did not reply to phone messages or email (except when requesting a return through Amazon) I am not interested in re ordering.
