{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great LCD TV - Much better price at Sams Club", "Author": "Robbi Shumaker", "ReviewID": "R3A9B9RQEMJ5DJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've only had this TV for a day, and we don't have our High Definition Cable service yet, but the picture is still really good.  My husband says it will be even better when we get HD channels (our new service is on the way).The colors are great and I love the fact that there is no glare on the picture.  We were going to get another TV with a few more features, but the picture had such a glare on it, we changed our minds.I will say though for anyone buying this TV at this price - think twice - we honestly only paid $748 for this exact TV at Samsclub.  We just got it today, August 25th, 2010, so I think this price on Amazon is horrible - more than twice what we paid.The TV is very stylish and easy to set up too.  If you decide on this one, and buy it somewhere cheaper, I think you'll love it.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "awesome tv", "Author": "happycamer", "ReviewID": "REK9VM7S1B0M8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have just purchased the TV and it is awesome,easy set up and so light.I only paid $599.00 and then I purchased an extended warranty.We have never owned a flat screen tv,all of ours are the old heavy,bulky TV's.
