We had a budget of under 650$ and I had some basic requirements like a HD input and USB ports. We have been using the tv for a little less than 3 weeks now.PROSThe tv is packed with intelligent technology like light sensor to match the lighting of the screen to that of the room for comfortable viewing and clear sound i guess to make the levels of dialogues stand out from background noise in movies.The tv has a very quick refresh rate.. reduces the stress on the eyes if you are a TV surfer.It is extremely simple to operate.. one would think that latest tech came with complicated controls.. but the remote and the control options put you at ease immediately.There are two HD input slots for your cable box and your PS/Xbox etc..CONSNow this is a BIG one and has me upset to no end. The USB reads only music and pictures. It doesn't play movies etc. One of the main reasons for me to purchase the TV was that and it let me down.So if you think you don't need the USB like I do, then you have no reason to shy away from this TV.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "No Audio Output!", "Author": "Ziggy", "ReviewID": "R1H1HBGC2Y7VPH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would normally give an LG product \"5 Stars\", but this model does not have an audio output, so there is no way* to connect to an A/V receiver that I know of.

I was torn between a more expensive LED vs more economical LCD. Both were fairly feature rich (multiple hdmi, etc) but when i got down to my main reason for a new tv - i discovered i want quality, reliability and a good picture - not features. I get netflix through xbox, so i dont need a smart tv, i dont need to  connect 12 devices, 3d is lame at best, so  I purchased a decent sound system to go with the tv and called it a day. It's true the tv has no audio out whatsoever - which I find quite unusual - but it could be the reason for the great price. My universal remote turns everything on and controls the volume, my sound runs directly from cable box /Xbox to my stereo. No issues at all. And the picture is terrific! Just my 2c worth...

I paid $530 at BJ's Wholesale Club.  It was a simple setup and the directions made sense for once.  Right now we are using the stand but I will be mounting it on the wall this weekend.  We also have Comcast for TV service.  The LG factory settings made the colors looked rather bland and washed out so I've been tweaking the color, tint, brightness, contrast settings.  I think I have the picture looking pretty good now.  At least the colors are more vibrant now and peoples faces don't look like a pallid corpse in a casket anymore.  However, we do have an older 42\" Sony LCD HDTV in another room that frankly has a better picture.  That said, that Sony cost us $2500  about 5-6 years ago.  So spending $530 for the LG is just fine.  We have the LG in the bedroom and we are not into Blue Ray, DVD's, DVR's, TiVo, etc.  We just wanted a good, crisp TV picture so we could at least watch the news, some sports and read the words and numbers scrolling across the screen on every channel.  The LG 42LS3400 has a refresh rate of 60Hz but there is no blurring, \"judder\" or ghosting even watching fast action football games.  I also think the sound is very good.  I don't understand all the whining about a lousy, tinny sound.  I use the remote from Comcast and it kind of sucks.  It has more buttons than an accordion.Bottom line for me is; the LG 42LS3400 is a pretty good TV.  A Sony or a Samsung might be marginally better but you'd pay far more for those.  So the LG 42LS3400 is definitely the better value for your money and it looks just fine.  We do not want or need a Smart TV with internet connectivity saddled with all the buttons, bells and whistles.  The LG 42LS3400 may not be as eye-popping as a Sony or a Samsung but it is much less expensive, easy to setup, easy to use, easy on the eyes and is a perfect choice for a bedroom TV.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG 32LS3400", "Author": "Eestlane", "ReviewID": "R2HFNQSJ6BTKWQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have had the product now for 2 - 3 weeks, and it has performed flawlessly.

For the price it's a great bargain, I was in WalMart the other day and they had another 32 in. for the same price but a no name brand.  How could you beat this?! :)  I definitely recommend this TV to other people.  DO NOTE ONE THING: I took a star off because when you are putting the pieces together, you will need a skinny screwdriver as any mechanical ones can't fit into the tight space where 2 of the screws go.

While it does not offer all of the bells and whistles that the latest and greatest TV's offer, what it lacks in gizmos it makes up for in spectacular picture quality, color rendering and an extra wide viewing angle all of which exceed many far higher priced TV's.  This is also a backlit LED (not side).  Like all TV's you'll probably want to visit some review sites and custom calibrate the color to their exact specifications if you are like me and are never fully happy with the factory settings.  This TV gives lots of options to tinker with the picture to your liking.  When calibrated, this TV is like looking out your window... I think the color rendering is as close to perfect as you can get.  This is a 60HZ tv.. not 120HZ.  The 240HZ or 480HZ have been called pure nonsense and a money making gimmic.  I personally saw no difference between the 60HZ and 120HZ but maybe you can...  if so they make this TV at 120HZ as well but you'll pay more.  Personally, 60HZ works just fine for me.  If I were to guess 60HZ works better on a quality screen like this than 120HZ on a cheaper one where $ has been spent on more gizmos you won't use.  Overall, an excellent purchase for a 42\" LED at around $500.  Check it out in a store and compare it to the higher priced TV's on the wall... especially the viewing angle!

It is fairly good looking from the front and sides meaning it bezel is small and its thickness is pretty low for a TV this cheap. This makes it come in at under 20 lbs for a 32 inch screen. The picture is great, and at 32\" the 720p only becomes noticeable from 1080p at around 4 feet or closer. I have never been let down by the picture. For a bargain TV it has enough connections, 2 HDMI is the absolute minimum as the are used up with an Xbox and a sound system. I thought the sound performed well for a TV this size, but as I desired it to fill a 10x12 room I had to add a small sound system. I am slightly disappointed when comparing it to the LG 32CS460 32-Inch 720p 60 Hz LCD HDTV, which is the LCD version. Even though you step up to LED you get the exact same frame, meaning it is not thinner like most LEDs. I do feel the picture is a lot better though as the LED do a better job of generating light. (brighter whites and that sort of thing.Pros:+Physically attractive looking bargain TV+Great picture for priceCons:-Not thinner than LCD model-Underwhelming sound-Bare minimum 2 HDMIs", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG 42LS3400 42 inch 1080 Pix/60 Hz, LED-LCD", "Author": "Frank J.
