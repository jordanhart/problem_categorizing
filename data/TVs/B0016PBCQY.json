As with most LCD's there is some backlight bleeding on darker scenes and off angle veiwing is a bit washed out on my set.Prompting me to return the first set.Both sets were about the same PQ-wise (great)HD cable and Philips 5982 upconversion dvd player.Let me tell U this is not your everyday 720p LCD.WELL....GO GET IT!!!!", "Date": "September 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "TV Alrite...bad luck/service!", "Author": "Prashanth Menon \"PMEN\"", "ReviewID": "R18JTNQQ4UKZQ9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this TV in late November.Delivery/Wt : On time and in good shape. Different vendor though. Light weight.Price : Very attractive($699)Video : Everything seemed alright, the SD pictures were just OK (I have comcast with a cable box, so I'm assuming it is decent quality feed). HD reception over the air was excellent. Connected to a PS3, played games and watched Blu-Ray/DVD, no complaints. With the hdmi cables the pictures were just perfect. Of course, the blacks aren't perfect black and not considering this to be a top-notch LCD tv out there, it was a given.Audio: Disappointing actually, doesn't go loud enough. Thought I would  connect it to the external Bose speakers, but the analog audio outs didn't seem to work.Looks : Piano black looks great, speakers hidden. Simple yet effective.Swivel stand was very helpful.A few days earlier (outside the return window), the TV shuts itself off as I was watching!!! Had to call the customer service after all the trivial actions failed. Now I have been told they are replacing two of the boards on it. I had to always call the repair vendor for an update, LG wouldn't provide me with any! Although they say it is a home service, after a visual inspection, TV was taken.Now it is an eternal wait to hear from them and hope it resolves the problem.Overall: I'm in two minds to have given LG a try, keeping my fingers crossed for any future issues. Would I recommend? Based on my current experience \"NO\". This is my first HDTV and of this size, so not sure if other TVs have similar problems. I assume I'm just unlucky with the piece I received.I have been counting on reviews and I hope this helps.All the Best!", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice picture quality but lousy UI", "Author": "S. Shelton", "ReviewID": "R18UQ1S5ZD4G8G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture quality on this TV is great but the UI (user interface) is bad.No PiP.  What year was this manufactured in again?  198...?  In 2008 (when this was manufactured), wasn't this feature, you know, about as standard as the ability to change the volume level?The various aspect ratio options (4:3 / 16:9) cannot be handled on the fly.  If you want to change them you must go into the menu system in order to change the setting.  On the one hand it's handy that the setting is saved per input, but with many SD networks airing 4:3 and letterboxed 16:9 it would sure be nice to use a dedicated remote button to toggle between these choices.You can name your input sources to some pre-selected names, but if you have a DVR you're out of luck because the designers decided not to give you that option.  You must call it either a \"Set top box\" or a \"VCR\".I have a Sony HD dinosaur from 2003 that has all of that stuff.  You'd think that by now the features would be standard and superior to what I bought years ago.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a great prive", "Author": "Michael A.

I use a Radio Shack antenna on the roof (80 inch VHF/UHF model) and the antenna signal goes through a splitter so I get FM radio signal for the receiver, a converter box for an old VCR, and the TV. After checking out the \"antennaweb\" site, I aimed my antenna as per the location of the broadcast towers, and I get ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, and three public stations including the high-def ones. I also got some religious stuff that I promptly deleted from the channel list.The TV gets great High-def broadcast signals so we watch all the prime time shows that we like, plus the classy public stuff like Masterpiece Theatre and Nova. I also bought a factory-refurbished Harman-Kardon 355 surround receiver that drives two Large Advent speakers at the front, and a pair of Smaller Advents as the surround channels. I have an Oppo upconverting DVD player that allows you to have hi-def compatible signals using ordinary DVDs, and the picture I get is every bit as sharp as the broadcast hi-def. I recently watched \"Wall-E\" and enjoyed it even more than I did at the theatre. The surround system balances up perfectly and is just amazing. No subwoofer needed.But even with the receiver turned off, the LG TV speakers are clean, uncolored and smooth. They only lack the deepest bass but not a problem for 95% of the program content.The Oppo DVD player is a great item, and it has excellent audio outputs including discreet channel outputs which work in the HK direct channel inputs. It plays every type of audio and DVD disc except Blu-ray. But I won't be getting blu-ray anytime soon, as the Oppo gives a great picture that looks high-def to my eyes, especially since I am over ten feet from the screen. One more thing-When I am watching hi-def broadcasts, the TV's digital audio out goes directly to the HK receiver via an optical cable, and the receiver automatically switches to \"Dolby Digital\" so you get pure surround audio with the picture. Can't beat it. I am a cheapskate but I don't like to compromise, so do yourself a favor, save some money and buy this TV!", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Impressed", "Author": "R. Lavoie", "ReviewID": "R1P1FCHYYFQT6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very impressed. My roommate recently moved out and took his 50\" Samsung DLP with him. Fortunately, this TV was not only cheaper, but also MUCH higher quality than the Samsung. The entire Southern wall of our apartment is a sliding glass window, and this TV shows absolutely no glare. The viewing angle is amazing! The contrast is beautiful - I have never seen a TV that looks this sexy.I would STRONGLY recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 42\". 720p looks 100% the same as 1080p for this size TV - you'd be paying more solely for bragging rights (but anyone who knows better will be laughing at you).My only complaint about this is the speakers. For any AV input, the speakers are plenty loud and I set the volume to 15 out of 100. However, for cable the sound is greatly diminished and I have to turn the volume up to 60 or higher. You don't want to be using a T extensively at near maximum volume because the speakers will eventually tear. I have some loud computer speakers, but unfortunately there is no Audio Out jack that size on this TV, just the red/white RCA cables jacks. No problem though, I'll just have to throw down a few bucks for a conversion cable.Overall 5+++ stars. I bought this TV from [...] with an amazon card I simultaneously opened. I got 6% back just from using the card, and $[...] off my first purchase, so the TV only cost me around [...]. Shipping was free, and [...] got the TV here in less than a week in perfect condition.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Television !!!!", "Author": "Joseph W.

We have not had to make any changes to the factory settings.  We have no problems seeing the picture even from extreme side angles.  This TV is on our lanai so there is a lot of natural light but the picture never looks washed out.

I feel that it is really crappy that I have had the TV for less than 3 years and LG only gives you a 1 year warranty with it.  Now I have to pay to get it fixed.  To me it is unfair to pay as much as I did for this TV and not even get a free $35 service call.

I can't comment much on the sound quality because it has always been hooked up to a surround sound system.Picture quality is to par on HD programming, on Standard D programming be it DVD, or cable, is below par. I.E. I walked in the living room the other day to see my wife watching Twilight on our up converting DVD player. In fast motion scenes this TV can't keep up and you get a lot of pixalation.One thing about this TV is lack of Features, My last TV before this one was a 32 inch Sony Wega(which i am still using 5 years later) It had more bells and whistles then i could ever know what to do with. LG not so much, The menu is very simplistic, It is missing some basic features that ALL TVs should have like CLOSED CAPTIONING.Now for the life:This tv doesn't have a great life span, Mine is already starting to go out....Turn the tv on, light flashes like it is about to come on, then no picture no back light nothing. Turn it off and back on starts perfectly.The second issue I am having with this TV is with HD programing, Flipping through SD channels it takes no time for the picture to catch up. On HD channels I can be waiting as LONG as a minute for my picture.Just a FYI: I am using HDMI cables for all my connections(blu-ray, Cable-box, and PS3)For Audio: Everything is Optical", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "A solid, 42 inch TV for the money.", "Author": "squashpup \"squashpup\"", "ReviewID": "R3E4CPIT596EXX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Don't worry about \"settling\" for 720p.  You really can't tell a difference between 720 and 1080 on this size television.  I've compared both head to head.  If you plan to sit within 3 feet of the TV, spring for the 1080.  Otherwise, get this one.TV does a good job, Audio is okay, but I'd like to see a headphone jack, so you could easily connect a computer speaker system to it.  That way you could significantly improve the audio without sinking a lot of money and time into installing a home theater system.Picture looks great with Dish Network's HD broadcast.

Overall I think its a good TV but I do have a few problems with it. I have a 42inch Panasonic plasma as well and when you put both of these side by side I do like the panasonic more.THE PICTURE:The picture quality on this TV is good but when I am watching HD programs from Comcast sometimes the programming doesn't look HD. I am not sure why this is happening. Blu ray movies on the other hand look spectacular I play them off of my PS3 which looks amazing on this TV so it makes me think that there might be something with comcast. When playing SOCOM Confrontation on PS3 there are some minor video problems, One being that every now and then the TV will freeze up for a second or 2 which makes me feel like the game is lagging when I think it is really the TV trying to catch up with the video. Also I am using the original video settings for this tv which other reviewers say are horrible. other reviewers say that once the TV is calibrated properly it looks 10x better, I am yet able to figure out the correct calibrations... If anyone has any please E-mail them to me Nathanj89@yahoo.comThe Audio:The audio  is different from other TVs of this size. I personally found it to be off when I first took it out of the box but then you get used to it. The biggest problem I have had with this audio is when playing Playstation 3 games. When playing SOCOM Confrontation on this TV it is fine when there are 1 or 2 gun shots. But when there are lots of explosions or even lots of rapid gunfire the Television lags in when the gun is firing on the screen and when the gunshot sounds are coming out of the audio. This is something I cant figure out and I am working to try to fix.Again if anyone else has this TV and has optimal settings or knows how to correct any of there problems please dont hesitate to email me!Nathanj89@yahoo.comTHANKS!", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "My Feeling", "Author": "Maurice A.
