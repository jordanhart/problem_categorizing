However, I did not see much offensive negatives in the foreground and was very pleased with the detail offered in 480i. The processors did a very nice job. Color rendition was not oversaturated, if not sometimes a little muted.With our Blu Ray set to 720p resolution to match the TVs resolution we were very impressed at the bright sharp images and intense color offered. The TV really has a lot of pop with HD material. We also did not note the negative background judder with HD material and this proved out with our HD HQV processor testing as well. Black levels were deep and occasionally oversaturated but not often enough to really be a strike against. Dark shadow detail was totally acceptable for a TV of this size and price range.Off center viewing was average on this LCD TV with the contrast and black levels fading at around 35 degrees off angle - again not bad for this price range.Calibration: Calibration through the menu was easy and the C350 did a nice job calibrating to near D6500K. There are advanced white balance controls included on this TV which is unusual for this price point. There are also many more advanced settings than I would have thought such as Black Tone, Dynamic Contrast, a Gamma setting, and a nifty Flesh Tone setting that will take the onscreen flesh tones from a yellowish to a pinkish appearance at your whim without changing the overall color appearance of the picture much.Picture settings as calibrated from the Custom Setting:Backlight: 8Contrast: 92Brightness: 46Sharpness: 10Color: 53Tint: UnchangedBlack Tone: DarkDynamic Contrast: LowGamma: +1Color Space: NativeWhite Balance-  Rgain: 27  Roffset: 24Flesh Tone: +1Edge Enhancement: OffAs far as aesthetic considerations go, the LN32C350 has straightforward design and better than the other 32\" models on the market except the LG's. You almost cant believe how light the TV is upon lifting it, a scant 15.7 pounds. The TV is 3.25\" in depth and 8\" with the stand. The included table stand is very light and inexpensive and the TV must be turned on its head and the table stand screwed on upside down to accomplish the assembly. It would be more convenient if Samsung would just include the stand already assembled on the TV, same as some other manufacturers. The table top stand does not swivel side to side. The 2\" bezel framing of the TV is gloss black and non-spectacular but does contain a sloped design element at the bottom.Audio Output: The two inbuilt 5 watt speakers barely get the job done. From 10 feet the user will need to keep the volume control at 75% of total capacity. The volume quality also is lacking with a tinny character and no base - but that's about all you can expect from 5 watt speakers.For more plus the overall ratings see LCD TV Buying Guide.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture for this Price", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R2LZLV8W0ZKYTV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's rare that i'm so pleased with a purchase so I just had to write a review.  After a very... very extensive search and looking at a lot of TV me and my GF just got this TV, it was our first big purchase together after moving in together.  Simply put this tv has amazing picture quality for the price we paid.  Also alot of people are complaining about the amount of inputs this TV has... but it's an HDTV, samsung isn't expecting you to connect your stuff to it with composite cables... what a waste!  I bought an HDMI cable for our cable box and one for our xbox360 and now we can hook up both and enjoying amazing HD quality picture.The one weakness of this TV is the sound is so weak! But all the TVs we looked at in this size/price range had weak sound so i guess that's just the way it is now as most manufactures expect it to be used with a home theater system.  honestly tho, compared to the other TVs this sound quality sounds really good... it's not at all loud, but at least it sounds good.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Bedroom HDTV", "Author": "Don G.

I had another brand of HDTV in there first, but with the new HD Receiver I purchased, I couldn't get a picture on it.  I moved it to another room and with the Samsung I had no problem at all.  I now have 3 Samsung LCD HDTV sets in my house, Living Room 52\", bedroom 32\" and 23\" in dressing room.  I couldn't be happier with my purchases of Samsung HDTV TV Sets.I have had several people tell me that they have never seen a better picture on a HDTV than the ones I have.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV for the price!!", "Author": "W. H. walters", "ReviewID": "R2CG8O48CFMSVC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second 32inch Samsung purchase.  My first was 6yrs ago and I paid $1450.00 for a 32\" that has less features than this one at $329.00.  So when the wife and I decided to get rid of the old CRT TV upstairs we jumped on this deal.I was a little worried about the sound quality because of the reviews but the sound quality is excellent!  It has 2 10watt speakers and a 5 band equalizer that comes with 5 presets and will allow you to set it up however you like. I honestly have no idea what people are talking about unless the volume coming out of their cable box is really low.  I turn my volume output of the cable box all the way up, then turn on the TRU Surround sound and set the EQ to the movie preset. You wont need to turn the TV volume past 15.The picture quality is fantastic and you have lots of adjustments you can make if needed.  Mine was perfect right out of the box.The USB port will allow you to view pictures & listen to mp3's and is controlled with the TV's remote.It is super lightweight and takes only a few minutes to set up.  I recommend you get an HDTV BOX with am HDMI output from your cable/satellite company.  Comcast even included an HDMI cable at no charge.Bottom Line:  If your looking for a basic model HDTV that has a great picture & sound look no further. I know its only 720p but honestly the human eye cannot tell the difference between 1080p & 720p on sets that are less than 42inch's.  My parents have a 32 inch 720p Samsung in their bedroom and a 52 inch 1080p Sony Bravia in the rec room and both of them agree that the Samsung has a better picture. In my opinion Samsung TV's have the best picture out there and amazon.com has worry free customer service.

When buying a TV that size in that price range, it is important to do research and try different models, more so than on a more expensive set. This is because many of these models are entry level/ value sets and you will most likely have to sacrifice in some regard. If you could find a perfect TV for under 500 bucks, it wouldn't be under 500 bucks.Anyway, this was one of the models I tried. The TV is extremely light, which is a plus. In fact, after trying out other models before this one and having a general idea of the weight, I actually thought that there was something missing when I picked up the box at Wal-Mart. REALLY light compared to other 32 inch non-LED models. Unboxing and set up was very easy. The stand is probably one of the easiest stands I've ever assembled. Just a few screws at the bottom. And it looked and felt like a decent, sturdy stand, so that was not sacrificed. When first turning it on, I was pretty satisfied. The picture was amazing. And this was just the standard setting without manual tweaking. There was some slight vertical banding, but that is too be expected. Very minor, however. The sounds was fine. I've read some bad reviews about the sound, but I was OK with it. But it must be noted that I'm not one to blast the volume. I had it set at 20 and it was more than adequate. So everything looked fine... until i noticed some ghosting on fast moving images. It was pretty annoying. Not the standard motion blur, but rather a ghosting pattern on fast moving images. A puck during a hockey game would leave a streak behind it, things like that. I tried to get used to it, but I just couldn't. I ended up returning the set.Now, it must be noted that i read several reviews about this TV and did not notice anyone with similar issues. So it is possible that maybe it was just a problem with my particular unit. Either way, because of the ghosting i give it a 4. Without that, this would definetly be a 5. Real nice picture, decent sound, decent everything, and great value.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Limited Inputs", "Author": "Jennifer D. Gregory", "ReviewID": "RNV23T9VYFYCN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture quality is pretty good, and it's one of the cheapest HD sets for this size. But there is only a SHARED component/composite input so you can only have one device of either type plugged in at a time. (Composite switchboxes are easy to pick up, but good luck finding a switch box that handles both composite and component.) Since all the female plugs are in the back (none on the side, as mid and upper range TVs for easy access and switching of cables), this is very inconvenient. This set was for our son, who has both a GameCube (composite) and a PS2 (component). He just plays the PS2 and the GameCube collects dust.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "L.

It's an easy fix if you go into the volume range settings on your cable box.  There should be settings for narrow, wide and normal---just switch until you find the one that fixes the volume for you (but make sure you have already configured your cable box remote to work with the TV).  I have 2 of these Samsung TVs and they are both amazing.

I suspect complaints about sound come from sets that had 5 Watts x 2 speakers. They now are 10 Watts x 2. Mine is plenty loud. (Also, apparently some people have forgot to remove the clear tape over the speakers!)Also, when released, the response time was 8ms. The later sets now have 6 ms. Both of above make it an even better buy than when released.Don't sweat the 720p ... on a set this size, the difference in quality from 1080p is not noticeable, so don't spend the money.I love Samsung.

The picture quality is very high.  No noticeable glare.  The speakers, even at max volume are frequently not loud enough.  Some adjustment on volumes of different frequency ranges helps with, but does not solve, the volume issue (bass seems to outweigh treble as the default setting).  The sound on the 10 year old TV it replaced was actually better, which is a little sad.The specs for connectors above list only two HDMI connectors, but I was pleasantly surprised that it has component video, standard audio, coax and VGA as well.  No standard video RCA video port, which is sort of annoying, but it hooked up to my xbox and comcast cable box fine.  It did not detect the correct aspect ratio for component video and that needed to be manually changed from 16:9 to 4:3 on the cable box.Overall, it seems like a decent but not great TV, but it is worth the money.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very poor sound with a good picture", "Author": "Iva H.

The  picture was good but the sound was very bad. The sound worbled at a low and medium range and you could not get a loud volumn range at all. It was very difficult to understand what was being said. I returned both after contacting Samsung who agreed after listening to the souond test on the one that I had hooked up that the sound was not ok.I held the phone if front of tv so he could hear sound test. He suggested I send it to Samsung for a tech. to look at it.I was going to do that but  I later tried the other one thinking it might have only been the one set. The 2nd set was worse then the first one. I could have returned the sets to samsung for repair but with both being bad I didn't expect this particular model to be much better after repair. I elected to return both to the seller VONN. I have bought many items from Amazon because they are great to deal with.

The set-up was pretty straight forward, and so far we've had no issues with it. If I had one thing questionable about it to mention, it would be the volume...At times, particularly on some DVD's, it seems to be on the low side, even when turned up almost to the max. This isn't a big issue, and certainly isn't, in my opinion, reason enough to return it...The pluses far outweigh this rather minor, and only, negative.

If you're looking for movie theater sound, purchase a receiver, sub and the other speakers. The in-TV speakers aren't meant for that.I found the picture quality to be great for a TV at this price point. The only thing I would mention is that if you're planning to extensively watch sports, you might want to consider a 120Hz display instead of the 60Hz that this set offers, but LCDs with such a refresh rate tend to coincide with 1080p and, thus, a higher price tag. I would also recommend calibrating the set to make it a little less bright, and to make the flesh tones more realistic. These settings can be found online.My only gripe would be a lack of HDMI inputs (this set has two), but I'm sure the average consumer would find it to be adequate for a cable/satellite box and a DVD/Blu-Ray player.In summary, this is a great LCD at an even better price.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice TV for price!", "Author": "K.

The picture is great, it was easy to set up, and the sound is ok.... thus the 4 stars.  but it's like that with every LCD TV I've ever looked at.  We normally hook ours up to the stereo anyway.

Any kind of flat screen.  Up until just a couple of months ago I was still watching one of those big heavy tube style TVs that finally died. After much searching the stats and reviews here on Amazon, I settled on this Samsung model, for my last TV was a Samsung and it lasted what seemed forever.  I also have to admit that a TV set to me remains just that, a TV.  I don't do any gaming on it, hook it up to any computers, or any other premium stuff beyond the DVD player.  So this review is strictly from the standpoint of an old fashioned couch potato.The Samsung is very easy to set up, and pretty much simple to get started and even customize without getting into the instructions, (which all men hate doing anyway).  The picture right out of the box is acceptable, but just about anyone will want to customize whatever is offered with that feature.  One thing I noticed about this model is that it carries very little in the way of preset color schemes, like some others I researched have. There are only three, and my experience with the trio left me with no great impression of them being just right.  All three will still have the average Joe wanting too fiddle with the contrast, brightness, etc.  However there is ample offerings in that area to satisfy anyone who strives for the perfect picture.  As far as the sound is concerned, I am afraid that I have to agree with the other reviewers here who feel it is substandard.  It is indeed a disappointment in that it has no real depth or power to it like one would hope for.  It's sufficient in how loud it can get, and sounds better than my last set to be sure, but it isn't much beyond that in either quantity or quality. (Also, a built in equalizer offers the user the opportunity to boost the loudness on 5 frequencies, which did make quite a difference). If you're one of those people that likes real theater sound along with your movie, you will have to settle for adding a better sound system to this model, and bypassing the TV speakers.  Something that is as easy as selecting it on the settings menu.Finally, one thing that I was surprised and disappointed at was the blurriness of of the picture without an HD signal. Though the color and brightness of this TV is excellent, for me no amount of tweaking with the settings or the sharpness control gave me a picture that was as crisp and clear as my old TV.  Some online research on the problem has proven to me that its all about the input signal from your cable or satellite provider.  Without going into a lot of technical mumbo jumbo, let is suffice that no matter what kind of TV you buy, this may be a problem you run into if you buy a new LCD and opt for sticking with a standard, or digital signal.  Like just about every other kind of electronic device, when the industry decides to move ahead on something and make it \"better\" they don't have a lot of patience for those that choose to remain nostalgic.  For me its just a problem I will have to live with until I decide to move up to HD TV.  Certainly not is the picture so blurry as to be a deal breaker and have me returning the TV.  I still feel it is an excellent, solid TV that will provide you with many years of service, and that still displays an excellent picture with rich color and brightness...Recommended for the track record I have enjoyed with all Samsung TVs....", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stay away from Samsung TV's", "Author": "aeo", "ReviewID": "R1R2979Q7VMHDM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this TV 2 years ago.

I almost bought the LG even though I have a silly love for Samsung products. Then i got on eBay, found someone selling it for the price of the LG and was sold :) I got it and boy I do not regret it one bit. The color is amazing (you'll have to mess with the settings a bit if you're a gamer). The only downfall isn't really a downfall, if you're wanting this TV for a big big room invest in some speakers, however if you're like me and it's for a small/medium sizeish room it's great. BUT! YOU MUST CHANGE THE AUDIO SETTINGS otherwise even with volume maxed out I could barely hear my Blue Ray DVD playing over my air conditioner (it's a sorta loud A/C). I actually got sad when I noticed this and then I remembered someone mentioning in a review to check the audio settings. I was watching a blue ray on my PS3 when I noticed it (by the way blue ray looks lovely) and the person also mentioned that it can some times be settings on your blue ray player, cable box or even ps3. I haven't tinkered with the ps3 settings yet because turning all of my audio settings up on the TV was the ticket for me, now at half volume the TV is pretty loud and very clear.Gamers will not regret this TV one bit if they take a few minutes to tinker with the color settings. When you first play a game you'll think it's insanely too dark, mess with it a bit and the quality is just lovely. I was playing Uncharted 2 on it and it's the prettiest I've seen it yet.One last comment for those skeptical because it's 720p and not 1080p, don't be. On a 32inch screen it makes no difference, the human eye cannot discern the difference between 720p & 1080p on a 32inch screen. You really don't have to shell out the big bucks for amazing quality or because it has a 1080p sticker on it.Anywho, hope this review was helpful. In my opinion if you are able to get this at a good deal don't settle for something else cause it's $30 cheaper or something, you will regret it. The only other flaw I think anyone could have with it was not enough inputs, I used the HDMI for my ps3, the VGA for my Xbox 360 and the RCA for my Wii but I also wanted to plug in my PS2 (RCA) and there wasn't enough space, but for any person besides me I'm sure it's plenty.All in all 5 stars!

Because this television is in my exercise room, I actually watch it more than the bigger 1080P LED TV in the living room. A 32\" screen is probably about as big as you want to go with 720P, which could be why a lot of brands jump from 32\" 720P to 37\" 1080P without any choices in between. The set only has 2 HDMI inputs, so it limits how many HD devices you  can connect. I've got a Roku in one and a BluRay in the other. For audio, it has RCA inputs, but a 3.5mm output instead of RCA outs, so I had to get a 3.5mm to RCA adapter to connect an old stereo receiver. The TV remote does not control volume on the audio output, so you need your receiver's remote for volume control. It also has a set of component inputs, and a USB port for viewing your own media and installing upgrades via thumb drive.Antenna reception is excellent. I really like the tuner on this set, it gives you a listing of all the stations you've programmed in, and show descriptions of every group of channels you've surfed through (provided the broadcaster included the information in their signal). Digital air channels typically have one HD primary (11.1 for example), and one or more SD sidebands (11.2, 11.3, and so on). So if I've hit one of the \"11\" channels, all of \"11\"s program listings can be displayed. And if I hop on up to \"13\", \"11\"s listings aren't forgotten. Analog channels are seamlessly integrated by channel number - I go from 13.2 to 15 to 29 to 31.1. I definitely like this TV's tuner better than the one on the living room LG set.The remote is very comfortable, and is ergonomically shaped so you always know that it's pointed the right way (I often grab my other remotes \"backwards\").If you're looking for a second or third TV, or have limited space for your primary TV, this 32\" Samsung is worthy of serious consideration.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung 32\" LCD TV", "Author": "JOHN CHAVANNE", "ReviewID": "R2U4EFKKWYDKAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased two of the Samsung 32\" TV's for our second home master and guest bedrooms.

Overall, we are very happy with it.  The picture quality is excellent, and it is easy to set up and use.  Having the VGA input is great: we can use Youtube, watch DVDs, and play games with ease using our computer.  We also use the AV input for our Wii.We have only two complaints.  First, the sound quality is not great, although of course you can always use your own speakers.  Second, there is a stupid glitch: if the AV or VGA input is selected, and the input is off, the TV goes input power saving mode after a few seconds.  The would be fine, except that this happens even if you're in the process of trying to select another input!  This makes it rather difficult to switch inputs.Overall, it's a very good TV, and a good value.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for Small room!!", "Author": "JP from TJ", "ReviewID": "R3M4K7YNLO8D7W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV after having an awful experience with a Westinghouse 32'led HDTV, i returned it with no problem at all, got my money back and then got this Samsung for the same price and a $20 dlls disscount for the bad experience on the Westinghouse.

Regarding the TV, itself, I originally wanted to purchase a 1080p but a techy-friend advised that 780p would still provide a great picture for a 32\" TV.  WOW!  What a great picture - so smooth and bright, very clear and sharp.  I have NO REGRETS!  I don't see reflections of items/people/lights in the room on the TV screen, which is always a nuisance.  Set up was easy and straight-forward - it automatically pops up when turned on.  Sound is good overall, but I have to really crank it up when I'm walking on the treadmill - but maybe that's a treadmill issue (oops).  And, I didn't give the 'design layout' 5 stars simply because I prefer a matte border on the TV frame.  Otherwise, I think I really got a deal.

Everyone's preferences and needs are different. Take the time to mess with the settings, it's worth it.Set up is extremely simple, the only \"assembly\" was 3 screws for the stand.
