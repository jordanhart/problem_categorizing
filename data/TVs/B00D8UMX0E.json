{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great CPU Monitor", "Author": "Craig Fries", "ReviewID": "R121ZAATC2BDCZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Anyone looking for a big screen for a computer monitor look no further this is it! I have tried many others and nothing compares to this (specially price) crystal clear and there is absolutely no distortion of any type. Truly amazing! The only draw back is you can't sit to close or you will have to turn your head left and right to pan across to see the entire screen! I am a contractor and I use this to view blue prints and this is as good as having paper plans! Truly amazing/awesome/spectacular/high definition", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$679.00", "Features": "NEC 42\" LED Edge-Lit Commercial Display w/ Tuner", "Name": "NEC Display E424 42\" 1080p LED-LCD TV - 16:9 - HDTV 1080p", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KfYIKk4RL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00D8UMX0E"}}
