I was not sure how much added value the internet TV would provide, but after having it for a few weeks I am very glad I went with this model over the non-internet models. I haven't tested every feature yet, so this review is based on taking the usual features for a spin.Delivery: White-glove service was fantastic (on-time, no damage), but then again it would be pretty hard to mess up walking the set 15 feet inside the doorway. Nonetheless, they did great.PROS:- Pandora rocks. This is by far my favorite internet feature to stream music through the TV. I don't have a big stereo system and FM reception is spotty, so this really was a welcome feature.- The sound is just fine. I know some say the Samsung sound isn't up to Sony, and that may be true, but how often are you blasting the volume past, say, 20? The room we have it set up in is relatively small (15x20), so it suits us just fine.- YouTube, Vudo, Yahoo, Associated Press, Weather, and Flickr feeds are pretty cool. You can download movies from Netflix and Blockbuster, but i'm not sure this is any better (cheaper) than most cable services. I guess if you don't have cable this would be great.- I have AT&T; U-Verse, and the SD picture is great when tuned to non-HD channels. The HD is amazing.- The Automotion is great, but only for sports in my opinion. We turn it off for regular programming as with HD and Automotion on, the scenes look a little on the cheap side (maybe too real??). It is like you are in the room, which i don't like. This is probably just a personal preference thing.- The TV itself looks amazing and the lack of the red-touch-of-color I think is a good thing.- Controls to tweak the picture seem more than adequate to suit anyone's preferences, though I'm not a A/V guru.- AllShare feature lets you access music, photos and videos contained on networked computers through your TV (after downloading/installing samsung software on your PC). This worked flawlessly and setup was intuitive.- Plug-N-Play media contained on a thumb drive works great too.CONS: I can't think of any major ones, but I'll list a few initial thoughts...- AnyNet+ seems before its time (you have to have all Samsung devices to use as far as I can tell)That's about all I have. If anyone has any questions, I will try to answer. All in all, I have to give this TV a 5. The potential uses for the internet connectivity seems huge.UPDATE: 4 months in and we still love this TV.  No problems whatsoever. There are some new Samsung Apps i thought I'd mention...- Google Maps App, can get live traffic just like the web version. Hard to get any accident data though.- Other new apps (but haven't tried): Napster, Hulu Plus, Facebook, CinemaNow?, DailyMotion?", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV (first impressions)", "Author": "T. Hladish \"gecko13\"", "ReviewID": "R2F3PEKXFQLZUT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had the TV for a few hours, but I have only good things to say at this point.  The image quality is awesome, the box was pristine, and setting it up was really easy.  The delivery guy even helped me get it mounted to the stand, which I don't think he had to do.  I like the menu system--it looks cool and is intuitive and well organized.There are a few things I was concerned about after reading reviews of other Samsung LCD TV's, but I haven't found any of them to be an issue:- The remote is not finicky.  You can point it in any direction, even backwards, and it works perfectly.- While you would not mistake the sound from the TV as coming from a good stereo, I'm very happy with it.  I've only turned it up to about 15 out of 100, and even that seems loud in a quiet house.  If it scales linearly, I can't imagine ever needing to turn it up all the way.- Some people complained about a system Samsung uses to dynamically adjust the backlight to get deeper blacks, and that this system is really annoying.  This TV either doesn't use it, or it's not annoying, or maybe I just don't know what I'm supposed to be ticked off about :)- One guy got the wrong stand for his TV.  I think he might just be incompetant.  I admit when I looked at the TV and the stand, I wasn't sure how they went together at first.  When I found the bracket for connecting the two (with good, albeit unnecessary instructions), it became obvious.- I'm not a big fan of the touch of color business, but most of the time you can't even see it.The picture quality is so beautiful I've even found myself watching (some) pre-recorded commercials, admiring nature shots and cars with sleek lines.  The new interest in commercials will presumably wane with time. :)If I discover any problems, I'll come back and update.UPDATE (5 months):  I still love the TV, and as predicted, I've gone back to skipping commercials.  With regard to the remote sensitivity, I believe the sensor on the TV is in the lower right.  At one point we had the Wii sitting there, partially blocking that corner, and it seemed that the remote connection became more finicky.  (The solution, obviously, is to keep that area of the TV stand clear.)If you have a laptop, the internet connectivity may not be worth it; check the price of the LN46C630 instead, which is basically the same minus the net connection.  Occasionally it's useful, but trying to type with the remote is clumsy, not all YouTube videos work (this is a licensing issue, not the TV's fault), and I can't open my Picasa account, despite going through the procedure to register my account.  Since connecting a computer is really easy, I very quickly lose patience with the built-in system.  I should try Pandora; I noticed another reviewer liked that.  I still love the TV, because it's good at being a TV, and I don't need it to double as a computer when there are four in the house.Regarding Auto Motion Plus:  At first, I just noticed that everything looked kind of weird and smooth--the best description I have is that everything looked like a soap opera.  Ultimately, I decided I hated it and turned it off.  As I understand it, it's a way of interpolating frames when the input is slower than 120Hz.  It seems like a good idea, I just couldn't get used to it.  If I could bring myself to watch a soap opera, I'd be curious to see how much soapier it can get with Auto Motion Plus.Also, do yourself a favor: buy a ~$5 HDMI cable online, rather than getting suckered into the $50-100 cables that do the EXACT SAME THING.  Keep your cables short and use as few connections as possible, and you'll be just fine.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "RGJOL07UOUBWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the TV for only a few days now, but it really is a great set. The picture is amazing and the black reproduction is really good. Internet widgets are extremely easy to use and were truely plug & play; no additional set up required. This set does include netflix and pandora, even though it is not listed above. One thing to note if you are purchasing this set is that the DVI audio input and audio output connectors are stero headphone connectors, not RCA red/white ones that are usually present. This led to some scrambling to find an appropriate converter when I was setting the TV up! Also, the screen is of the glossy variety. I personally am not too bothered by it, but when the screen is dark and the room is light, you can see reflections of the wall behind you. Again, not that big of a deal for me!", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overall very good picture quality, sound quality eh..", "Author": "S. Bhattacharjee", "ReviewID": "RKK6Q1D6RIFUW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered through Amazon, and had white-glove delivery w/no problems. These guys give you a call, and can even setup a Saturday appointment.Out of the box picture quality was too vivid for me. But the controls are extremely easy as is typical with all samsung tvs. In complete darkness, if the tv hasn't been playing for a while, you can notice some glows around the edges, but its typical of most lcd tvs. You can tweak to get the picture quality to exactly what you would like.The main difference between this and the LN46C630 is the internet option in this one. You need an ethernet cable, no wireless built in. But you can apparently get a wireless dongle. The main thing, I use it for is Netflix streaming. It has yahoo widgets, but being someone who spends a lot of time with computers in/outside of work, I wasn't too impressed with the other options. I paid the extra hundred or so bucks to mostly be future proof, but you can skip it. And instead get a blu-ray player with internet options, which should give you exactly the same experience. And if you already planning to get a PS3 or waiting for the rumored nintendo HD wii, then you might as well get that instead of spending the money for the internet option on the tv.The main disappointment with it, is that the sound quality isn't great. Specially, with my attached blu-ray player. I can't really tell any of the difference of HDTHS among other things that the blu-ray player is suppose to support. But if you are any serious about sound, you will invest some amount of money on a receiver anyways, so you can't reasonably expect a TV to support it.If you are a bargain hunter, then your local Fry's (at least here in California) could have a better deal, but I really liked the convenience of in-home delivery and  setting up on the swivel and stuff. Getting it from a local store does give you the option of exchanging it for a different one, if you dont like it or something. But I had pretty much setup my mind on this anyways.", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing,Beautiful TV, Amazing Deal.....Amazon is Amazing", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1PZZIPPCXW0NM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been actively searching for an lcd tv for 6years. Every newspaper circular etc.I have a crt tv that worked fine and I really enjoyed seeing the prices on lcds drop and drop and drop.

I have almost pulled the trigger on a few, like sharp or panasonic  but then as I became more educated by reading specs over years on the hi-def LCD, I realized Samsung was the leader in the game.

Taylor", "ReviewID": "R39QOE1SEEN42L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research, and this model was one that kept coming up as a consumer favorite.First, Amazon: although it said \"out of stock\", when the deal popped up to get the LAN stick for free, I couldn't resist. I just figured I'd have to wait forever. I even went ahead and priced the model locally in case I had to cancel the whole thing and start over. (I found it at Best Buy for $1097.)Amazon's price for me was $891 with free shipping and a free LAN stick. It took about 2 weeks before I got the message that they had one in and it had shipped, despite the fact that the product page always showed \"Temporarily out of stock\", and I know . . . I checked every day.The delivery service called me on Monday to arrange for delivery. Then they gave me a courtesy call 30 minutes before they arrived to let me know they were coming. Everything went smoothly, and he made a point of showing me the Customer service number in case I needed to arrange for a replacement, etc.First impression: so . . . it took a little while for the thing to power up that first time. It hasn't been a problem since, but I kept wondering if I was missing something.I've only owned the product for a few days, so I'll wait a few months and add a note, but so far, I love this TV!The remote is a little clunky around the \"cursor\" keys (i.e. directional keys). A couple of times I went for the side key and ended up hitting something else, but that's very minor. I did turn off the auto-motion while watching movies, because it does give it that surreal \"soap opera\" effect, rather than the film effect, but everything works smoothly. The response time for the remote is quick.Once or twice the widgets might stall (I was having connection problems, which I'll go into later), but pressing \"exit\" got me out of trouble. Even while I was playing with the Internet TV features, the regular TV program played in the PiP and I could still change channels.I mounted this on the wall with a Cheetah Mount APTMM2B, which was pretty easy, and my only complaint there is that the TV is so slim and so close to the wall that I had to take it down again in order to attach the coaxial cable. The other plugs are a tight squeeze (RCA plugs from DVD player, etc.), but I can get them in and out without having to take the TV off the wall.I'm really enjoying the Internet features. I've spent the last 2 days struggling with the LAN stick. There are problems there, and not tons of answers, mostly depending on your router, etc. It works great for some people; and doesn't work for others. I did not use Samsung support, but went through the CNET forums, where I tried everything, and have come to the conclusion that my router may just have been too far away from the TV.Now with the connection issue fixed, I'm streamed a movie off of Netflix with only a few stops for it to \"catch up\" (it also has Blockbuster, Hulu, etc.) and I've got Pandora streaming now.The widgets are nice, though a little limited. It's interesting that the button to access the widgets is literally labeled \"Yahoo\". I wonder how much Yahoo paid for that. There are informational widgets for weather, sports, news, and a few limited ones like Showtime, etc., but nothing jaw-dropping.Back to the connection: I have spent a lot of time trying to make that work, playing with routing settings, TV settings, reading the forum, so that has been an issue. There are either some compatibility issues OR the LAN stick isn't quite powerful enough. I'm guessing if your router is strong enough or close enough, you won't have an issue. If not, get your glasses on and start hitting the forums.So to recap: it's light, thin, beautiful color, good sound (I haven't plugged into external speakers yet), but for PC and internet connection there are some issues (even those people running cables to the TV were on the forum asking about the dreaded \"Gateway Ping Failure\"), but once you've got it working, it works well.All it has to do is keep working and not suddenly conk out or go haywire and I'll keep this at 4 stars.***UPDATE***So, now I've owned this TV for about a month, and I really do love it.Networking (LAN Stick): I finally bought a different router to see if it would make a difference and the answer is yes and no. I changed from a LinkSys to a D-Link. The connection speed is slightly faster with the D-link (not by much), but the setup is much much easier. Where I spent hours finagling with the Samsung settings to get it to recognize the Linksys router, the D-link set up so quick I almost wasn't sure what had happened. The Linksys would either not work or it would stop at the Gateway Ping. The D-link router had no problems.Widgets: I've come to consider these a novelty and nothing more. I play with them every now and then, just because they are there, but I wouldn't base my purchase solely on these, and unless a lot more interesting widgets get added, I doubt the true value of them. Maybe if you're deep into sports, you can get scores. Facebook is there, as well as Flickr, but MySpace isn't, nor is Twitter. In the month since I've owned the TV, I don't think I've spotted any new widgets.Internet TV: The three applications I've most enjoyed so far have been YouTube, Netflix and Pandora streaming radio. Netflix and Pandora both require a setup, meaning you have to go register on the internet and put a code into the TV at the prompt. Not much difficulty here, and once you've got it setup you don't have to worry about it anymore. I would like to see the ability to register a YouTube account though, since I have an account but haven't figured out a way to get \"my\" YouTube preferences setup on the TV.Speakers / DVD: I set up my older DVD player through the components (RCA plugs, etc.) since my player doesn't have HDMI or anything fancy. I've had no problems and movies look and sound great. I plugged the TV into my receiver and there are times when the TV is louder and better sounding than my speakers.TV Reception: Since I live in the country, I don't have cable or Satellite. Yes, I actually use an antenna. I'm using a Phillips HDTV antenna and since the DTV conversion I've had a lot of difficulties with reception. This is not a fault of the TV in anyway, but I thought I'd mention it since the TV seems to draw in more stations and at a higher quality than the DTV converter box ever did.USB: I truly love being able to take content from my PC (or someone elses), slap it on a thumbnail drive, plug it in to the side of the TV and watch whatever I've loaded. This is a great feature. I should probably invest in a slingbox or some other utility, but this is working for me so far.I gotta say, I'm still really liking this television and haven't had any difficulties with it yet.Update (12/17/10):Networking: No issues. Once setup, always setup. Moving the D-link router around got me a better connection.Widgets: I hardly mess with them.Sound / Picture / ease of use and remote: All excellent. There are only tiny details about the remote that I would change (like moving the Favorite channel key closer to the channel change key), but those might be a personal preference.DLNA: I finally figured out how to stream media content (avi, mp3, jpg, etc.) through the router to the television.(NOTE: some formats are not compatible, such as .mkv, but if you're dedicated there are free shareware programs that will convert mkv to avi and do a resonably good job.)It took some doing, but it wasn't a Samsung issue; it was a Windows issue. I'd see folders show up, then not show up. I tried every sharing trick I could find, and again hit the CNET forums to figure out what I was doing wrong. The PC wasn't in sleep mode, so it wasn't that. I even downloaded the PCShare software that Samsung offers on their website (onto my PC).Here's what finally worked: In Windows Control panel, under networking, I would see the network map, but not see the TV listed. I also didn't see \"Play to\" listed in the dropdowns on any of the folders, and in Windows Media Player the \"Play to\" feature was missing and the \"Play to\" icon was greyed out. In the network map, at the bottom I finally spotted a \"device\". The icon looked more like a phone, but when I clicked and installed it, suddenly my shared folders had the \"Play to\" feature again. I'm not sure if the device showed up because I downloaded PC Share (which I've sense deleted, since this version of Samsung TV didn't require it) or if it had always been there, but I hadn't noticed it. Note: the \"Play to\" icon on Windows Media Player never did ungrey, but right clicking a movie or song and chooseing \"Play to\" brought up the choice  \"HDTV\".I still had difficulty figuring out why some folders would show up in the Media Play on the TV and some wouldn't. Right clicking and choosing share on the folder in Windows didn't help. Right clicking and choosing properties, then choosing the Share tab and clicking the box for share was the first step. The next step was to right click on the folder and choose \"Include in library\". It seems like those two steps are necessary, though I couldn't tell you why.Now everything is working the way it was intended.Outside of that, once or twice when loading Netflix movies, the screen would go black and freeze. I had to unplug the TV and plug it back in. Once or twice when loading Netflix or media content the TV would go black and freeze then suddenly turn itself off and on. Those occasions have been rare, and for all the hours I've watched TV, DVDs and content streamed from both my PC and external sources (Netflix, YouTube, Pandora), it's been an excellent purchase.Samsung could've provided better support (it sounds like) when their customers needed help connecting their TV to different routers, etc. But overall, any device your connecting to your PC wirelessly is going to have the same kinds of issues. That's more of a windows issue than Samsung's fault. In other words, I'm not sure how much of this problem is Samsung's failure to design a TV that works easily with most mainstream routers, and how much of it is the complexity of networking through routers and windows. There is enough blame to share evenly, I think.If your choosing this TV for the networking features, be prepared to spend some time figuring it all out. Once done, however, you won't be sorry.****UPDATE*** 9/20/11Still no issues. I've noticed more widgets, including Twitter, Pandora, etc. but nothing amazing. Netflix, Pandora and other Internet apps still work fine, better since Netflix updated its interface to include search capability.As for as the file sharing, it appears to work through Windows Media Player. I can share any folder, but unless I open Windows Media Player and let it \"find\" the content, it won't appear in the shared folders on the TV.Once or twice the connection has been lost in mid-stream and I've had to re-establish the Network settings (enter the PIN of the router), but then it works fine.The most troubling feature is that there is no good rewind/fast forward feature for shared media content. You can skip ahead and back by a few seconds, but no actual fast forward. (Internet content like Netflix fastforward fine.)Another little troubling feature is that I often have to edit my internet applications. Some times I have to re-add them, because they've disappeared (usually after an update). Twice now I've gone and deleted the ESPN application, because it falls from the recommended apps down into my loaded apps.These little troubles pale in comparison to everything the TV does.", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN46C650", "Author": "S.

This TV is amazing: beautiful picture, lots of great features, all at a great price.  Like most people, I turned off the \"Auto Motion\" feature fairly soon after buying the TV, but like having the option to go back to it in the future.Touch of Color:  I almost went with the LN46C670 at Best Buy because I was worried about the \"Touch of Color\" on this model.  If you've thought about that, I'm here to tell you the color is completely unnoticeable, unless you're looking for it.  The only time I was able to see the color from more than 4\" away from the set is by shining a flashlight on the bezel.  Seriously, don't let the color keep you from buying this TV if you're considering it: you won't even notice it.Internet Features:  I thought the internet features might be interesting, but considered buying the model without that functionality because I didn't think I'd use it much.  I can say that I've used it much more than I thought I would.  Pandora and You Tube are great, but Netflix is really amazing if you've got an account that allows you to watch streaming video.  I have my TV hooked up by a physical LAN line, but consider the wireless dongle if that's not an option for you based on where the TV is going.  I hope they add more apps in the future, I really like the internet functionality.Glare:  I was worried about glare on the screen after reading some reviews, but I haven't found that to be a problem, even in my fairly bright room.  I notice it more on the bezel than on the screen itself, but as long as you have at least a moderate ability to control the light in the room you'll be using this TV, I think you'll be fine.Miscellaneous:  You can't really tell from the photos of the product, but the difference between the \"rear\" and \"side\" inputs is minor.  The HDMI and other ports are all easily accessible, even the ones on the back.  The only way I could see you having trouble accessing them would be if the TV is mounted to the wall.The TV swivels on the included stand (for table top viewing, not wall mounted) very easily.  It's really a smooth swivel to position the screen just right.  I'd estimate the screen swivels about 30-40 degrees in each direction on the stand.  Updated, Nov 2010:OK, so I've had the TV for about 6 months and thought I'd revisit.  First off, I still love the TV.  Picture and sound are still great (this is my first HD TV, so I'm not a screen resolution/refresh rate expert, but I am still blown away by this TV).  I've had no problems with the set, and would still recommend it.Glare: I've noticed the glare a bit more since my original review.  It's not terrible, but if you have a bright window or light behind where you sit, you're going to see some glare.  I have the ability to block the light in my room, but the bright summer afternoons would be tough if you don't have good curtains.  The TV has a setting for room brightness, so you can set it to accommodate your needs, but like a lot of the settings, it's buried in the menu.  The screen picture setting (different from the room brightness setting I was talking about above, this is the standard, movie, sports, options most TVs have) is easier to get to, and will probably help you switch the picture quickly.Auto-Motion Plus: it's growing on me.  It looked a little too sweeping and motion-sickness-causing at first, but it may just be that I wasn't used to the more realistic view of HD.  Anyway, I like it for fast sports programs.Internet: Since my first review, I've set up my Twitter and Facebook Accounts on the TV.  It's a novelty right now... there isn't a way to click on links or pictures on Twitter (that I know of, anyway), so it's not going to replace my computer for that, but Facebook is kinda cool.  I wouldn't use it for posting, but reading statuses and walls and looking at pictures is great.  It's great to look at pictures of friends/family when you have guests over.  I still use Netflix streaming ALL THE TIME.  It's awesome.  I see that they've added a Hulu Plus (the upgraded, paid account service) app.  I don't have an account, but I'd guess it works much the same as Netflix.Photos:  I talked about Facebook photos above, and there is also a Flickr app in the Yahoo tools that displays photos.  I find, though, that the TV is a great way to display photos for guests right from my digital camera.  The interface with the TV is really great, it lets you use the remote to play videos and flip through still photos or start a slide show.  You just need a camera with a USB connection.  Finally, a friend is a computer geek and downloaded a movie onto a USB drive, which played right on the TV, once he saved the file as the right type.

The TV was described as \"good\" condition with minor cosmetic damage to the front/side/back housing of the TV and accessories which seemed okay to me. The shipping took FOREVER, about 10 days to be delivered so I'd recommend paying for shipping rather than waiting that long. Second, I had to call Pilot and schedule the appointment for delivery because they just let it sit in the warehouse without bothering to call me (I plan to call Amazon and complain about this). Third, there was only one delivery guy that brought the TV and he dragged it along the ground to get it to me and claimed the box was dirty because it had been sitting in the warehouse (yet another point I plan to complain about).The TV came in it's original box and packaging and upon inspection, I did not notice any cosmetic damage to the front/side of the TV but it does have a small dent on the back of the metal housing (no big deal)and the remote was in like new condition. The user manual was a bit wrinkled so I guess that's the accessory they were referring to with having minor cosmetic damage. Once I unpacked the TV and got it connected, the picture during the day was quite good. I owned a Samsung LNB52750 before so I knew what to expect from these CCFL TVs and the picture was very similar to that model. I also owned a Pioneer Kuro so as far as black levels go, the Kuro blows away this TV but the brightness for this panel similarly blows away the Kuro so there's a trade off. The menu is quite robust and snappy. The sound needs some tuning via the equalizer to make it sound good, it's too weak/tinny out of the box.At night I hooked up my Alienware M17x-R2 notebook--which incidentally also sports a Samsung made 17\" RGB LED--to the TV and used the Boxee application to watch some TV shows. I turned on The Event and noticed during dark scenes that there was flashlighting coming from the upper left corner of the display. I immediately paused the show, switched the notebook desktop back on and set a blank screensaver. I was disappointed to find quite visible flashlighting in the upper left corner and slight blotching/bleeding in the center right side of the panel as well. Sometimes taking a microfiber cloth to the LCD and massaging it can lessen the flashlighting and in this case it did for my TV but not enough to make it disappear, it's still visible at night during dark scenes.As for the picture quality, it's quite good and I'd say it has better motion handling than Samsung's LED 240 hz TV's despite only being a 120 hz display. The auto motion plus works quite well and I prefer using the standard setting. Raising it causes a bit of jittering and increases the \"soap opera\" effect too much. I still do not understand why companies like Samsung have difficulty building a large panel without these kinds of issues. The Samsung RGB LED panel in my Alienware M17x-R2 is flawless, it has absolutely no light bleed and the colors are as vivid if not more than my LN46C650. In fact I'll go as far as saying Samsung's notebook RGB LED panel looks better than their consumer grade LED televisions in color fidelity, contrast ratio and black levels.I was strongly contemplating returning the TV last night because of the flashlighting but then I looked online and noticed Amazon bumped the price of the TV back up to $1056 so that idea went out the window. I might try to push for an exchange if they allow it otherwise I'll have to live with these flaws.Overall I'm happy with the TV and recommend it despite the flashlighting. The menu is easy to use, the picture quality is very good, the sound is adequate and the bezel design is quite nice. I haven't tested the internet features of the TV yet (I really have no use for them) but will get to it eventually and update this review. I am definitely not happy with Amazon Warehouse's slow shipping nor was I happy with the way Pilot handled the delivery process. Fortunately the TV was in very good condition and I would say that if you can save $150+ versus buying it new, it's worth giving Amazon Warehouse a try. Just keep in mind some of the caveat's I mentioned when purchasing from them. Samsung LN46C650 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV (Black)UPDATE: 12/11/2010So I've had over a week to play with the TV and finally got around to hooking up the TV to my router for some internet action. I subscribed to free trials from Netflix and Hulu Plus and found both work quite well with the TV's built in interface. With Hulu Plus, you are given a similar interface as the web version except more streamlined. It lets you filter your preferences based on what's popular, category and has a search feature. However, the downside of using Hulu Plus for Samsung TV's is that some shows are web only and not licensed to work with the TV. One such show was Dead Like Me--bummer for having to pay for a service and not being able to utilize it fully.Netflix tries to customize it's movies and tv shows to the viewer's preference by asking a series of questions to get an idea of what you like and do not. Once those questions are finished, you are greeted with a screen that lists popular movies and tv shows, instant queues and breakdown of movies and tv shows by category. My biggest complaint with Netflix is that no matter what category you pick, the first 3-4 movies are recent releases and the rest are very old (70s-80s releases). If you're a movie buff that enjoys watching 20 year old movies, then Netflix is for you. Their TV show selection is quite weak, Hulu Plus does a much better job in that regard. I plan to cancel Netflix and instead download movies I want to watch and stream them over my network. I did that last night with Transformers 2 (1080p bluray rip) and it worked great.Other applications like Pandora work quite well, they have a clean simple interface that works very similar to the web version. Facebook lets you get a quick glance at updates but don't expect to be typing status updates. The news ticker works quite well, not much to say there. I haven't bothered with the other applications since they do not interest me.Overall I'd say that using a home built media box that is linked to your home network with a remote control (e.g. logitech remote) would be far more effective than any of the aforementioned applications. You could run Boxee off the media box for all your TV show needs and if that doesn't cut it, simply switch over to DVI and use the web browser to find what you want on the web. Or better yet, download all your favorite TV shows and movies and stream them from the media box to the TV directly. Alternatively, one could put movies and tv shows on a USB external drive and connect it to the TV's USB input. The only time I would recommend Netflix and Hulu Plus is if someone is not technically inclined and has to settle for these services.12/25/2010Final update: I wrote Amazon an e-mail with a complaint of the issues I experienced along with some other problems the TV had.

Then, shortly after the manufacturer's warranty ended, the TV started flickering regularly.  After checking that it occurred on all inputs, I found numerous postings about this issue online.  There's a video online with nearly 20,000 views that shows how to fix this problem in about 15 minutes.  I figured before becoming my own TV service technician, I'd check with Samsung Customer Service.  I asked them if there was a service bulletin about the flickering issue or if they'd logged similar issues from other customers with the same model #.  They denied knowing of any common problem and suggested I download the latest firmware.  I told them the firmware clearly states that it's for fixing a \"USB Power Overload\" message.  They suggested that downloading the latest firmware fixes most problems and that I'd need to call back for a service repair estimate if it didn't.As expected, the firmware download didn't resolve the flickering issue.  I ended up following the fix described online, and in 15 minutes, my TV was fine and has been for months now.  If you can use a screwdriver and clip a \"jumper\" wire, you can do this!  I completely understand that there are manufacturing issues in all industries.  What's important is how companies choose to address those issues.

This is my first LCD TV, after thinking (daydreaming?) long and hard about it for quite some time.  Here are some of the things I had wondered about and what I discovered:Q.  Is 46\" the right size?  Too big?  Too small?A.  I sit approx. 10 feet back, and 46\" is a great size.  I had thought about 42\" in the past, and I am glad I went with the 46\".  A 50\" would have been too big for the amount of space I have in the TV area, but otherwise might have been okay.Q.  Does this particular LCD have dark enough blacks?A.  Yes, I think so.  I had leaned toward plasma in the past because I really like dark blacks.  But I have personally been satisfied with the blacks I have seen on this one, even in a darkened room.Q.  How's the sound?  I've heard it is horrible.A.  I wouldn't say horrible, but adequate.  When I watch a movie, I route the sound through my receiver system anyway.  I would recommend a similar approach for any TV.UPDATE 1/11/11After having more experience with this TV and seeing my comments above again, I want to comment on the \"dark enough blacks\" item.  If you like to watch TV in a VERY dark room (i.e., no lights on) and you really like dark, inky blacks, you probably want to go with a plasma TV.  This LCD TV had good black level scores from the stuff I saw online, so if this is pretty much as dark as LCD TVs get, seriously consider plasma.  I watch with a low wattage bulb on (easier for the eyes to switch between light and dark scenes), and I have been satisfied with the black level on this TV.  There are some uniformity issues, but not enough to regret my purchase.  And I want to reiterate that I am very glad that I went with the larger 46\" size.  To me that has been about the best thing in getting a new TV is the larger size.  I really enjoy it.  I would recommend nothing smaller than 46\" unless you sit very close to the TV.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV - Great Picture!", "Author": "Blackie", "ReviewID": "RL0SX2LFEX7UX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first tv purchase ever and I did a lot of research.

Sound quality is what you would expect from a TV (in my opinion same as the previous years model which I was able to view at best buy).

Currently however, Samsung Apps is not working and Samsung has not acknowledged the problem or a estimated timeframe for a solution over chat or by phone.

Do a google search looking on Cnet forums for the thread regarding \"Network Interference, try again later\" for more details. Until this issue is fixed, I wouldn't buy the set over a non-app set.

The picture is fantastic, the sound is more than good enough for my tastes, and (apart from the slightly-annoying lack of an s-video port) it sports a great selection of interface ports.So why not five stars?  The internet set-up.  This set's internet capability was a major discriminator when I selected it and, even though all seems to be working now, the process was painful.Note: I am using the add-on wi-fi dongle (available from Amazon) for my TV's connection.The first problem came when I was ready to connect the set to my wi-fi router.  When the character selection screens came up so I could enter the WPA2 key, I realized they don't offer an apostrophe!  There were many other symbols available, but not the one I needed for entering my key phrase.  Why that omission, when they had much more rarely-encountered symbols (who uses a caret in a pass phrase?), makes no sense to me.  My choices were abandon the idea of using wi-fi for the TV, or change the pass phrase in my router (and hence in every other wi-fi device in my home network, of which there are many).  Add to that fun the fact the interface for entering the phrase is klunky, and completion spits you back to what looks like \"it didn't work\" screen, and the process was far, far more painful than necessary.Next problem: Pandora and Netflix didn't work.  The only two internet apps I cared about, and neither functioned.  Netflix simply refused to start, and Pandora froze at \"connecting.\"  After a great deal of Googling and reading, it became apparent this was a widespread problem, and the recommended solution was to download and install a firmware upgrade.  The built-in interface for the TV didn't recognize any such thing were available, so I was forced to download from the web site and go the thumb drive route.  Next problem:  the only available file was listed as \"all OS\" but is really a Windows executable archive.  All my computers are Macs or run Linux.  The only thing between me and an angry call to Samsung's tech support was the fortunate availability of a Windows virtual machine via secure shell to my work system.  Once that nontrivial undertaking was accomplished I had a thumb drive armed with the needed files, which the TV recognized and installed with no further issues.  A reboot, and the internet apps began working just fine.Now, finally, I'm possessed of a fully-functional Samsung.  As I said above, I'm quite pleased with how the set works, and it looks wonderful--but Samsung has a TON of work to do in the set-up arena.

Traughber", "ReviewID": "R2MR11MIH94LSB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Samsung LN46C650 for about 1 month now.  So far, I am very impressed with it.  The picture quality is amazing.  Even analog SD cable channels look clearer than on my old CRT type television.I use this TV primarily as a second monitor connected to a desktop computer and also I use the DLNA streaming quite a lot to stream video over the LAN from a computer to the TV.The DLNA streaming works better than I expected.  The Samsung PC Share Manager software also works nicely and seems stable running on my Windows 7 64bit desktop.  The Samsung PC software is pretty basic, but does work well.  I also tested streaming directly from Windows Media Library, and that seems to work quite good as well.The TV's media player does a good job with most of the latest video and audio codecs.  h254 and xvid videos play flawlessly, as do many other formats.  The only thing I have had any issue with are some .wmv files. The older WMV2 codec is not supported at all by the TV.  The newer WMV3 codec is supported and does seem to work, but sometimes, it is quirky.  I have come across several wmv3 videos that will start up and play fine until you try to skip ahead or backwards.  When you do that the first time, the video will freeze for 2-5 minutes, then start playing again.  From that point on, you can jump ahead and backward with no problem.  If you stop and restart the video, this behavior will repeat.Also, once in a while when jumping ahead or backward while watching a streaming video, the TV will suddenly display an error 'not supported codec' and drop you out of the video.  When this happens, I just restart the video, then use the resume feature to jump to where I left off.  It's a minor annoyance and only happens rarely.  I think this is likely more of an issue with the video file itself than anything else because this only seems to happen with files which are of unknown or questionable quality.I want to stress that the issues I have had with streaming have been the minority.  By far, most videos I have tried to play have worked flawlessly.  Only the occasional glitch or weirdness with some .wmv files has been observed.Also, I had some trouble finding this info:  The DLNA streaming feature does support subtitle tracks, but only the kind that are in a separate file (.srt and a few other formats) - Subtitle streams embedded in the movie container (.mkv - matroska most often) are ignored by the TV completely.To use subtitles, you need to make sure the video file and the .srt file both have exactly the same filename.  Only their file extensions will differ.  Place both files in the shared directory.  When you play the video on the TV, you can press the Tools button to turn the subtitles on or off.  It seems to work very well for me...I also had a Samsung Blu-Ray player already before I got this TV.  I didn't even realize the Blu-Ray was Samsung, because I got it as a gift last year, and have barely used it.With it connected to the TV, the AnyNet feature is activated.  It's actually pretty nice.  You can come along when the TV and BD player are both powered off, press the eject button on the BD player and insert a disk.  This will turn the TV on, and automatically tune the source to the BD player.  It also means you can control both TV and BD player with either one's remote.  Also, it means that you don't have to have all of the Anynet components within line-of-sight to control them with the IR Remote.  If any of your Anynet devices can 'see' the IR from the remote, it will send the command to the appropriate device.  When I initially read about AnyNet, it sounded like a lot of marketing hype to me, but I see now that it really does work, and is a nice little feature.  I am considering a Samsung surround receiver to replace my aging Yamaha just so I can have a full AnyNet system...I have also played around with both the Youtube and Hulu+ applications.  Both work well, but as others have said, typing with the remote is a pain.  Sadly, the TV does not support a keyboard at all.  There are rumors that Samsung may be planning to add support for a USB keyboard in a future firmware release, which would be awesome, but I wouldn't hold my breath...My only real complaint with this TV besides the lack of support for a USB keyboard would be with the Remote:  In general, the layout of the Remote is pretty good.  Also, the back-lit keys are nice.  HOWEVER, the navigation keys are NOT illuminated, and they are the ones I use the most, so that is a bit annoying.  Also, the Return and Exit buttons are very close to the left and right navigation keys, which means you sometimes accidentally exit the video when you only wanted to skip ahead, etc. because you hit the wrong key.  That is also frustrating.  All in all, though; Not deal-breakers for sure...I would and have recommended this TV to others.  Despite a few minor shortcomings, it has exceeded my expectations.  I plan to buy another LCD in a few months.

Two composite AV connections, 4 HDMI connections, ethernet, 2 component, 2 USB, and a DVI. I might even be missing some of the connections - it has everything. The USB ports, one of the HDMIs, and a composite AV connection are on the side for easy access, but the TV stand swivels easily enough, so it's not hard to reach the ones in the back, either.Internet/Netflix: Plug in an ethernet cord and you're ready to go. I'm streaming netflix from my TV without bothering with my Wii or computer, which is nice, but the TV apps are really insufficient. You can access your instant queue for netflix, that's it - there is no search feature or anything. Netflix instant streaming does look pretty bad on this TV though because streaming is not HD. There are other apps as well, but they are equally terrible - you cannot do a search on facebook, so if you want to find a friend's page and you have a lot of facebook friends, enjoy scrolling through hundreds of pages manually.Also, if you want to go wireless, be warned: you need to buy a very expensive adapter, the TV does not support wireless from the box!Media: If you connect this TV to your network (via ethernet or wireless adapter), you can stream things from your computer. Nice, but it does not support many formats such as MKV. Again, there is no search, and it displays your media in a really odd form - if I want to play music by a specific artist, I have to manually scroll to get there. Fine if you want to play \"Beatles,\" not fun if you want to play \"White Stripes.\"The solution to the bad media menu/apps is to hook a computer up to the TV, which is very simple to do if you buy an HDMI cable and your computer supports that. Buy a wireless keyboard/mouse to go along.Glare: Although not a huge problem, I do notice a bit of glare on the TV from the lamps in my living room - luckily I do not have any windows. I'm not sure how much of a problem natural light would be for this TV.Picture quality: The TV really looks excellent. However, be sure to disable some of the advanced features - most shows look really funny if you enable a refresh rate of higher than 60Hz. I especially notice the quality when I hook my computer up to the TV. At full 1080p resolution from a distance of about 10 feet, I can make out the text of icons on my desktop. Amazing!Remote: definitely my biggest complaint. I like to switch between antenna/computer/Wii a lot, so I am frequently using the remote. Unfortunately, the \"source\" button is way up top, but the arrow keys used to scroll are in the middle! Someone did not think that through.Other: The TV takes about 3-5 seconds to turn on. This is pretty standard with HD TVs, but something to be aware of. It makes a sound after it turns on instead of as it is starting to turn on which makes no sense, but if you look at the red light in the corner you can tell if you have successfully turned the TV on, as it begins to blink instead of staying solid.In summary, this TV is great for the price range, and I do not regret my purchase, but it does have some minor flaws, especially in the media area. However, most competitor TVs do not have these features at all, so it is still a step up.", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "C. Regan", "ReviewID": "R288MHJR9NCR1H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I even review the actual product, let me say that the delivery service of this TV was great. It is a scheduled delivery that you choose at your convenience to ensure that you'll be home, and it's free shipping (well it's from Amazon, so of course!). They even help set up the TV and test it out before they leave to make sure that the TV is in perfect condition.As far as the TV goes, the picture quality is AWESOME. I tested it out right away by playing The Dark Knight blu-ray, and I was absolutely blown away by the crystal clear clarity. I felt like I was actually at the bank in the first scene with the Joker's bank robbery. The sound on the TV alone is pretty good too - not great, but this isn't really a big deal to me since I have a Home Theater system.The customizable options of this TV, the way it's set up, and the features of it just make this TV a great buy. There's honestly too many cool features and options with this TV, so I'm not gonna go in to all them. But for one example, a nice little perk of the TV is that this TV communicates with my Home Theater so well that I can actually use my TV remote to control the HT system volume (even though they are different brands). This was not possible with my last HDTV, as I was only able to operate my TV with its remote, and my surround sound with the home theater remote.I gave this TV 4 stars instead of 5. This is because the screen is not \"matted\" like many of the other HDTVs out there to eliminate glare. The screen is considerably reflective and shiny, making dark scenes hard to view during the day. This is usually a pretty big deal to me, but this TV is so good that I can easily deal with one moderate drawback. I definitely recommend it.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "An excellent TV, an excellent value, some weak menus.", "Author": "J. Dollak", "ReviewID": "RX81RGPPVNY63", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My TV was delivered yesterday.  The box was in great shape - pretty much as good as anything off the shelf in any store.  It took a little more to set up the TV than I expected, only because the TV is wide enough that it's difficult to move with only one person.  But the setup amounts to just screwing a connecting element to both the base of the stand and then to the TV.It picked up my DVD player, Xbox, Apple TV without a hitch.  I still haven't hooked my Wii up, but I don't expect any difficulties with it.The picture looks spectacular.  I'm mostly using broadcast TV, and it still looks great.  Playing a bit of Borderlands with this TV is amazing.There are two complaints, but they are minor.1 - I don't like the remote layout/menu layout.  I don't watch much broadcast TV.  I mostly play games, and watch stuff on DVDs or the Apple TV.  The button to switch between sources is up at the top of the remote, and the button to scroll through those choices is toward the bottom of the remote.And the menu layout is a bit annoying when it comes to this too - if there isn't a live signal on one of the device's lines, the TV treats the device as not being active, and shuffles that device to the lower end of the list.  The net effect of this is that you need to turn the device on before you switch the TV to that source.2 - By default, an effect to make panning really crisp is on.  This is an effect that a lot of people have pointed out.  The annoying part of it is that this feature can be turned off, but it's a bit harder to locate in the menu than it should be.I haven't used most of the internet features of the TV yet.There is one other thing to note - the product description leaves off a few things that this TV has.  There are two Component and one Composite connector as well.This is really useful.

I bought it for my basement den. The reviews that describe mediocre sound for the TV are more or less correct, but since I am not an audiophile, it sounds good to me.  Sound varies greatly in volume depending on source: CATV or DVR.  The picture is very good, especially in HD.  I am now addicted to HD.  The video still has some motion artifacts even at 120MHz, but you have to really be looking critically at the picture.  If you are just watching a show and absorbed in the action, you probably won't notice.  I have not bothered to try and \"tweak\" either the picture or sound, though I will probably spend some time on that in the near future.  I paid $1097 delivered.  The delivery was much earlier than I expected, and I was excited to receive it.  After inspecting the box, I must say I though it was going to be DOA.  The box had a large hole on the top that had been taped over.  On the bottom it also looked like it had been pierced with one of those loading vehicles with the two metal lift arms.  Both the truck driver and I though it was in bad shape.  The impact sensor had also been set off.  We noted all the damage on the bill of lading, and I was thinking of refusing delivery, but began to examine the TV inside the box and surprisingly it looked OK.  I went ahead and accepted the TV and then unboxed it.  Hard to believe, but it worked just fine with only one slight blemish on the bottom of the frame.  The view from sitting on the couch looks perfect.  I've let it run for a month and all I can say is that 46\" is awesome, and whoever designs the packaging must be pretty good.  The folks from ONECALL were good about contacting me ahead of time, letting me know what to expect and good instructions.  When I left feedback they called me personally to let me know how much they care about customer support.  I was impressed with ONECALL, despite the way the box arrived, and would definitely purchase from them again.  The Samsung LN46C650 is really a good value in my opinion, and the delivered price from ONECALL was worth the time I spent evaluating the purchase.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "What a pleasant surprise", "Author": "picasso", "ReviewID": "R25H5109X3O62C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As i was researching purchase of a TV, i came across this product on Amazon.

Amazon shipped this product through CEVA and I must say I was pleased that they took the time to open the box, inspect the product with me and set it up for me and did not leave until they were certain everything was working and satisfactory.The TV has performed fantastically and has far exceeded my expectations for the price. I have had it for 2 months now and still come home from work to fiddle with it. Movies show great on this (particularly interesting picture with auto motion plus). I have this connected with the WIS09ABGN wireless adapter and it works pretty well. I haven't had any issues with it other than the cable company screwing with the signal  (a la verizon) when I stream shows, particularly in HD. The internet apps are awesome and include vudu, netflix, blockbuster, cinemanow, hulu plus, pandora  etc etc. which i use constantly (hence the cable company nonsense).Overall I am beside myself with how this purchase turned out.

Netflix works seamlessly and so easily that anyone in my home can figure out how to get a movie streaming.Pros:Crystal clear life like image. Internet@home apps really are nice and I'm sure they're going to only get better down the road.  Rotating base, I now see how nice it is to have this.  HDMI-CEC, which gives the ability to control my receiver and PS3 from my TV remote control.Cons:The screen is extremely glossy and unfortunately the window behind one of my sofas glares off the screen during daylight hours.  However, I beleive the extremely clear image quality may in part be assisted by the glossyness.  It's easy enough to rotate the TV to help reduce the glare.  The audio output is a 3.5mm headphone style output.  I'm not a fan of this because it is easy to damage the output should the wire snag when rotating the TV, and actually this had happened to me on the television I replaced with this model.Amazon's Free Super Saver Shipping:5-9 business days is correct.  I ordered the TV on a Sunday and it arrived via Pilot Freight Services on Thursday of the following week, so it took nearly two weeks.  The evening before delivery I received a call from Pilot to inform me of the four hour delivery window.  The solo delivery guy called me 30 minutes prior to his arrival and at delivery I assisted carrying the TV inside.  We pulled the TV out of the box, carefully laid it against the wall and plugged it in to make sure it worked.  I signed for the TV, and off he went.  It would have been nice of him to offer assistance in puting the TV on the base since no one else was home at the time but I guess he was in a hurry.********  August 28, 2011:The TV has started flickering, as if the LCD panel is losing power or signal multiple times per second.  Samsung says I am 28 days past my 12 month warranty period, but whoever I spoke to says he will attempt to extend my warranty 3 more months in order to get the TV repaired for me.  I had a bad warranty repair experience with a Samsung BluRay player that was given to me for Christmas last year, and now this.  [holding my breath]********  September 2011Samsung extended my warranty by a couple weeks and paid for replacement of the internal power supply which was causing the flickering issues.

It took a while for Amazon to get some more in stock when I placed my order, which was a little frustrating but they made good on their end of the deal. The TV is svelte, and can be managed easily by a marginally strapping man. Getting the included base properly inserted into the TV by yourself can be tricky though - so maybe you can invite a friend over for that step?Picture quality - once calibrated using the settings others have posted - is great!!! Definitely disable the AutoMotion because it is distracting as hell and I feel doesn't add anything to the viewing experience. On top of that, the processor that handles the AutoMotion can get bogged down and the picture will stutter every now and then - the antithesis of what it is trying to do!The Internet connectivity is awesome if you have Netflix - I just wish they'd update the app. The app itself isn't buggy but to say it is kind of basic in functionality is being polite: my biggest gripe is that it can't seem to buffer adequately (perhaps the TV doesn't have enough RAM available for this?) because HD content will almost without fail have to stop and buffer at least once. I wish it would autodrop down to a lower quality or atleast let users select what quality to watch in. The app also gives no indication of how far along you are in playback which I would consider to be the easiest thing to implement.The biggest wow-factor with this TV is its ability to play content that is shared wirelessly on the network (if you have the TV connected to a router or get the wireless USB dongle accessory) or content that you've downloaded onto a USB stick and plugged into it. It has yet to not be able to play anything I've downloaded off the internet. I guess the internet at large has adopted X264/H264 encoding as a standard which the TV understands.Overall I've been impressed with this TV.

(So pleased I ended up taking a pass on that 52\" RCA projection TV back in 2005...)I've looked at TVs in pretty much every big box store there is... each time being blown away by the display from Samsung.  I had been leaning toward the latest offering from Vizio, but as much as my wallet would have liked the cheaper price, my eyes were sold on the quality of the Samsung.Here is my take on the LN46C650:This TV is dead sexy.  Totally sleek and cool form factor.  The clear outer bezel with touch of red feature is just that... a nice touch.  I was initially worried the red would be too much and distract from the TV itself, but it's not.  There's just enough of a deep shade that you really only see it when you look for it.Speakers are on the bottom, facing down.  This does not appear to have any impact at all in the sound quality.  For movies, I do plug into an external stereo system, but for everyday viewing, the built-in speakers are fine.I'm blown away by the options to tweak the picture.  Everything from movie modes to a grossly overdone Dynamic mode, the tweakability is totally up to you.  For the first few days, I was always watching TV \"through the menu\" because I was constantly messing with the settings.  Being able to make these kind of adjustments is a good kind of problem!One setting that I did immediately turn off was the Auto-Motion Plus.  I've only since turned it back on to show off how realistic the TV can make the picture.  Unfortunately, it's just too realistic for everyday viewing and kind of ruins the TV or movie effect you're used to.  Makes it look like you're actually there in the scene with the actors and is a distraction.One of my favorite things about this TV is the playability of files from a USB drive or external hard drive.  The TV natively supports the .mkv container, so playing 1080p BluRay rips from an external HDD is as easy as plugging it into the side.  Very cool.  This has allowed us to say goodbye forever to the DVD player.  Physical media is on the way out.Streaming to the TV over WIFI is also cool.  I've had no trouble at all using the Internet@TV feature.  Mostly, though I just use the Pandora app for music.  Streaming movies only really works up to 720p, apparently, due to bit-rate.  1080p becomes too choppy over WIFI.  I followed the suggestion of others on a Samsung forum to use a program called Serviio as a DLNA server instead of the Samsung product.  Serviio works great, is free, and is always being updated by the developer.In conclusion, I'm so pleased with my purchase of this television.

My previous TV was a JVC 32\" standard TV that I bought back in 2002. The picture on this new TV is quite amazing. Colors pop, images are sharp and everything looks fantastic, particularly games and DirecTV via the HDMI input. I do notice some traces of ghosting with the component cables (I have some other consoles hooked up via component), but the picture from them still looks good. The internet connectivity has worked well for me with no issues thus far, and I'm excited to see what else will become available for that feature in the future. My only beef with the TV is that the digital audio out only supports 2 channel audio unless the signal comes from an on air broadcast. This came as a surprise to me, as I was expecting full 5.1 support for HDMI components. I had to workaround and get the audio adapter cable for my old model Xbox 360 to get HDMI picture and Dolby Digital 5.1. I also took the digital audio and the HDMI out of my DirecTV separately for the same reason. Other than that hiccup, I really like this TV!UPDATE 10/10/13: I am happy to report that after 2.5 years of use that I have not encountered the problems associated with Samsung TVs.

The picture is outstanding. I can't get over the detail and the vivid color. The controls, including the remote, are very intuitive and easy to use. The pedestal, which allows turning the unit in different directions, works well and is a nice feature to have. The only design feature I would criticize is the unit controls at the bottom right of the screen are very difficult to see. In ordinary room light, I would need reading glasses and a flashlight to have any hope of using them. Since all of these controls are normally performed using the remote, this is not a problem of any consequence.The internet apps seem to work well enough, but I don't have much need for them since most everything I would be interested in has a charge and is probably already available from my satellite TV subscription. I had hoped maybe to save money by using the internet to replace some of my satellite TV subscription costs, but it doesn't look like that is going to work.This replaced a 37 inch 720p TV. Prior to making the purchase, I was concerned that I was wasting money on a new set and that I wouldn't notice much difference. Believe me, the difference is night and day. I have glasses with a very slight long range prescriptionand rarely wore them when watching the old set, however, I rarely will watch the new one without them. The detail just adds so much to the viewing experience.I chose to buy an lcd rather than an led, because I had read many reviews that indicated that, due to the thinness of the led housings, the speakers were not usually large enough to give satisfactory sound.

In some ways it the little brother of my Samsung 850 series 52\" main TV but this LN46 is a newer generation and has the Internet connectivity the 3 year old 52\" lacks. So I mostly knew what to expect and Samsung didn't disappoint.  Great picture (once I tweaked the settings and changed from the preset \"standard\" mode to \"natural\") and an interface I am familiar with. No trouble setting up the Netflix and Yahoo widgets and in an initial test they worked well.  But The TV did have to do some updating which took a few minutes.A couple of nits, though.  First, like my 52\" Samsung, when you set the audio to \"external speaker\" all volume control via the TV is disabled so you need to use the remote for the other device (like an a/v receiver) to control the volume.  Some other TV brands, like my old Tosh LCD and Mitsu CRT, still pass through variable volume control so that you can use the TV remote and be able to change channels and control the volume from one remote.  I know, could use a universal remote, and in fact I have a nice Harmony I use with the 52\" setup that is fantastic.  But down in my workshop I would like to keep it simpler and cheaper.  So I need to find a cheap universal that will allow a control of the LN46 channel and Yamaha receiver volume w/o having to select the specific device, like my Harmony does.... or I need to keep the 2 remotes handy while working out which is not an ideal situation.  Samsung should include an audio setting that allows the user to select it to pass through a variable audio signal to the external system.Another minor nit: the power cord is ridiculously short.  I mounted the TV on the wall and routed the cables down from the middle under one of those flat plastic beauty covers to keep the mess invisible.  The power plug barely makes it through with a fooot or so extra.  So I had to move my surge supressor from its nice neat accessible spot over near this to be able to plug it in.  I am probably going to get a short extension cord to fix this but Samsung should have used a longer cord in the first place.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV but jury still out on Samsung support", "Author": "Bernie", "ReviewID": "R3GVTSJDSJVRVQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this TV on Feb. 25th 2011 and have now been using it for about a week.

The real issue is how poor Samsung support has been throughout this time.  My experience seems to match that of many other user's which is that Samsung's different levels of support don't seem to have a clue about what is going on.  If Samsung continues to have such poor customer service and if the Apps function never works properly, I don't think I would recommend a Samsung Internet capable TV to anyone.  5 stars for the TV itself but a reduction for the customer service issue.UPDATE - After the first week of ownership, Samsung apparently fixed the Apps issue and I can now access the Apps purchase/download area.

This set seemed to have all the specs I was looking for and the reviews seemed to praise the excellent picture quality which is always most important to me when choosing a tv. The design of this set is great and the swivel stand is very convenient. The styling of this set makes it suitable for any room with its \"Touch of Color\" design which features a very subtle deep dark red border and clear bezel overlay as shown in the pictures. Alot of people have complained about the speakers but they seem to get the job done. I plan on purchasing a soundbar so tv speakers werent very important to me. Besides tv speakers arent meant to blow you away anyway. As far as the picture, this set has so many image adjustment features that will allow you to adjust the picture exactly to your liking. The auto motion plus feature is pretty neat at times. It does make everything seem like its right there in front of you, but it can look nice at times. I usually only turn it on for sports since it gives you that feeling like your right there in the game with them! Alot of people confuse Auto Motion Plus with 120hz. The TV will always do 120hz regardless if Auto Motion Plus is turned on or off. Auto Motion Plus is just a feature that helps smooth out images and get rid of juddering. The remote control is backlit which comes in handy when channel surfing in the dark. Some people have complained about input lag but I have yet to experience any lag when gaming on xbox live or on my pc.

First off, it's a little intimidating  because all of the features it has, but once you start to get to know how to use these things it's really cool. Actually Samsung Customer Service is truly excellent. They will stay on the phone and walk you through stuff and seem knowledgble. When you first get a TV with this picture quality, it's gonna seem a little strange, because it seems like the faces of people are like in 3D or something, but that is just the clarity of HD. Sound on the TV is great. It is internet compatible, which i didn't actually hook up till this month. Well, because the first time I tried just hooking the Ethernet connection of my Time Warner Cable service to the back of the TV nothing happened. I don't know what I did wrong the first time, but it didn't work. The second time I inserted the Ethernet and turned off the set and and turned it back on, it recognized the internet connection and I hit the \"Internet TV\" button and it was all good after that. Once you start downloading the Samsung App widgets like Pandora it is the ultimate home sound system. The speakers I read somewhere are only like 20watts or so, but they sound like 80 and it trully has nice sound. I even hooked up my Blackberry HDMI cord into the HDMI connection on the set and played the music on my blackberry. Some song didn't play and I don't know why, but if you have downloads from the ITUNES format of from ITUNES you will probably be able to play back all of them. The system has cool levels for watching your picture like, Natural, Movie and Dynamic, Standard, all are great, I like to watch live action in Dynamic, IE Jet Games(i'm a big fan) it's so cool.Picture clarity is great. But it will take your eyes some used to . I just hooked it up to a sourround sound home theater system I had from Sony for about 15 years and with the jack input for sound and audio it made the sorround sound possible. I'm probably gonna bye either the Samsung 5500 Blue Ray Home theater or an LG.  Now you can't browse the internet with this thing, but you can check your Facebook account. I have downloaded the Widget for Napster and Facebook, but I can't figure out why it wont let me use my current account, i'm working that out. It also has a Netflicks widget which is one of the coolest of the widgets. You download up start and it give s you a code end the web address to sign up with the code and it automatically starts on the TV. You must load the movies you want to see in your \"Instant Que\" at the Netflicks site. Once you add movies to your \" Instant Que\" using the 30 Day trial they give you, it's all good. You probably not go the movies ever again. All in all, I never owned any piece of electronic equipment this cool.

This is especially noticeable when the picture has darker images.TV is best placed in a darkened room where few reflections are present.

I have not been disappointed.  The picture quality is great, internet features work beautifully, and the tv itself looks nice in our family room.  The delivery company was prompt and kept me updated by phone as to when they would be at the house.  They set the tv up for me with no problems.I upgraded our cable internet service for streaming Netflix content and am running the internet through the house's electrical system from our router.  This saves having to run a physical cable and lets me connect wherever there is an outlet.  I also added a small Acer computer with wireless keyboard/mouse and the set makes a great monitor.My only quibble is that when streaming Netflix content, the \"smooth motion\" function seems to be always on, giving the movies what I call the \"soap opera\" look.  I.e., the action looks unrealistically (or maybe over-realistically) smooth and silky.  I have turned off the smooth motion (I forgot the actual name of this function) control in the options, but I haven't found a way to stop it when playing internet content.  Tech support wasn't much help, since they told me twice to turn on the function in the main options after I told them I had already done that.All in all, a great purchase at a very good price.

Otherwise, simply shutting the power-off button only puts it into a stand-by mode, which is certainly not power efficient as opposed to the set being fully shut down.Secondly, the TV was advertised as having the \"red-light\" feature technology, which I suppose was a manufactured feature just to evoke the \"wow\" factor to the viewers, but mine never seemed to work at all.  Either I didn't hook the TV up correctly initially (these modern, newfangled TV's are not just plug-in and turn on anymore), or the red light feature is completely defunct/defective.

Seems to be true.I watch a lot of Netflix, and do a lot online, so I bought this TV for the 'apps' and particularly for Netflix, instead of getting another TV that was similar but much cheaper because it lacked the internet functionality.So I tried to use the apps today.  The Netflix one doesn't work.  It's not that I have it configured wrong, or it was hard to set up... it doesn't work.I don't know how many ads I've seen for Samsung apps that use the Netflix logo, etc., which is unbelievable because the app is useless. It's just a picture on my screen with no functionality whatsoever.Google this problem--You will find a lot of discussions going on about the fact that a lot of the apps, particularly this one, are very temperamental or just broken, yet Samsung keeps advertising them and has not fixed them.The TV, as TVs go, is great.  Great picture, sound, whatever. A lot of TVs have that.  What makes this one special, and hundreds of dollars more, is bells and whistles that don't work.  So go buy a different one that's cheaper and does the same thing--and buy it from somebody besides Samsung, because it's clear that they only care about getting customers, not about treating them right after they made their purchase.I completely regret buying this television.***UPDATE***After apparently more than a year of selling TVs without a working Netflix app (not all their TVs, apparently, only certain models), Samsung has fixed the problem.  I've only given the TV two more stars not because it isn't a good TV, but because now that I have it I think the extra features just don't justify the extra cost.  There are so many ways to stream things to your TV now, I don't really think it's worth it to pay to have all this extra functionality built into the TV--especially if you have to pay even more to get the wireless USB connector.  If you get a really good deal, then go for it I guess, but just make sure you check out your options and think about which features you're actually going to use.Beyond that, it's hard to give a good rating to a company that misrepresented a product for so long by continuing to make a show of advertising an app that was not functional.

Well much to my delight they had this model, my friend had this C650 C meaning this years model, the display was a B meaning last years model and i was about to go with it but they had none. So i said ok just give me the new one. I got mine at Sears so i sat with two remotes, one for this and one for the 1899% LED 46\", the picture on this just crushed it, i adjusted all the same setting on both and it was just like night and day, and this was just BASIC CABLE!! So i was sold, got it home, hooked it up, had it set up within like 5 minute with little to no fine tuning and its just the best picture you will find on any model of Samsung out there. This is a higher end model and it has the glass panel covering the front, as some do, and some don't, this give it a real glass type look, and movies just out at you almost like 3-D. Avatar looked amazing and my father about fell over when he saw the picture compared to his 52\" Samsung from last year(which looked great) but nothing like this. So you think LED's are overrated? Well this will prove you right, i've been through many TVs trying them out, tweeking them etc. and nothing can top this one, sure the Panasonic had very deep black levels and a great picture, but it didn't have the 120hz Motion Plus and didn't swivel. The 600hz that is broken up into 60hz each all around the Plasma HDTVs doesnt compare to the fluent motion of the lcd's, you still see judder and motion blurr, just a little less blur, but lots of lag.

The generally excellent reviews of picture quality are well-deserved. However, the premium in cost for this model (650) over the lower models that do not include the Apps and Internet TV feature may not be worth it. Buyers should be aware that a lot of people are having problems with these features, particularly if you use Verizon FIOS as your ISP. A google search of Samsung TV along with internet connection or network interference will show you that this feature simply does not work for many people, and Samsung has not addressed it at all, and has barely acknowledged it in any way. It is amazing that these tv's continue to be sold with this feature non-functional for millions of people.Even getting the yahoo apps to work (which I eventually did) takes hours and hours of trying different things, resetting the tv, playing with your router settings, etc. I am a very sophisticated user with a lot of knowledge of networking, electronics. etc and it still took me hours of internet research to get even the basic apps to work. LIke many others, I could not get the Samsung apps to work (which include netflix, vudu, etc)I would recommend getting the next model down and finding another way to get internet access on your tv until Samsung deals with this issue. I will be filing a claim with the better busines bureau over this issue as I believe samsung is charging for a feature that simply does not work for many people. (Note that the only response from Samsung on this has been to blame it on Verizon, but that's nonsense given that Verizon is one of the biggest providers of internet access and generally has very high quality technically. The best explanation I've been able to find is that this feature depends on using a port that Verizon blocks to keep people from using home service to provide web servers. I'm not sure if this is correct as Samsung has never provided any technical info on what ports or services are required for this feature to work.Update March 2014I do have the apps working now.  Not sure whether a firmware update from Samsung, app updates, or Verizon updates did it, but it all works now.  I changed it to 4 stars now as I'm quite pleased with the tv at this point.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "PLEASE DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG, FOR YOUR SAKE!", "Author": "PistoleroDR", "ReviewID": "R1QDTUQAK7PON5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After many hours reviewing brands/models, I purchased a brand new 46\" Samsung LN46B650 TV.
