I previously owned another SAMSUNG LCD (still in use) and a VIZIO LED. This TV beats them both in every aspect. I compared this tV at Best Buy (where it was selling for $200.00 more)and the color and clarity could not be mathched by any of the other brands that they had on display. I placed the TV in our upstairs TV room and connnected to my wireless N (cisco) with no problem. NETFLIX looks awesome when compared with my other two TV sets. Like any of the new TV sets that come with a good group of APPS, navigating with the controller does get irritating but thats an issue with all of the TVs that are on the market. Invest in a remote with a keyboard and that will resolve your issues.This TV beats out the Sharp AQUOS (with QUATTRON) and the new Sony Bravia's. If samsung makes a 60 or 70 inch version of this TV I might buy it.AWESOME TV.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture, the Smart TV area is just so-so", "Author": "Carlibra", "ReviewID": "R3JMC3IVSRMQ1V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it at Costco, mine was a returned item so there was an additional 25% reduction in price.  I got it for just $1025, regular price was $1425.  Three things it doesn't have, 3-D, Skype or internet browsing, more on that in a momment.  Those would cost another $1000 to have in their newest and best models.  I soon noticed that when the whole screen is black, there seems to be some kind of faint light spill-over from behind the screen.  This may cause me to return it, but I have time to decide about that, but once the screen has a picture, it's not noticed.  The remote has the familiar four direction arrows and centered Enter key, the problem is they are not each defined by touch alone, so you are almost always forced to looked at the remote to be sure you are using the right key.  I noticed the newer remotes have fixed this problem.  Ok, so the picture it makes is really great!, but how about the Smart TV?  When you go into the Smart TV screen, which is beautifully arranged, you can still see your current channel in the upper left, while then being allowed to select apps.  Another slight annoyance is that after I navigate to the fourth app icon, the system \"thinks\" for five seconds before it will allow me to continue to navigate to other apps.  The All Share in the Smart TV area allows you to retrieve data from your computer on the network such as your, music, photos and videos.  Some file types will not play, however.  When you play a video, an overlay with various options appears for several seconds.  I wish there was a way to turn that off.  When watching photos, the slide show feature has left out probably the most useful mode: the dissolve effect.  Instead you get \"spiral, checkers, linear, stairs, etc., this was quite disappointing to me!  Btw, your photos will look super stunning in 1080p!  I contacted Samsung, this model will not have Skype capability.  As for internet browsing, you could hook up your computer to the PC imput but for $99 you can get the Logitech Revue powered by Google TV, that has a web browser, plus it comes with a nice wireless QUERTY keyboard.  It also makes your TV into a \"Smart TV\", but in a more useful manor than what Samsung has done so far.  I'd give this TV a 9.4, I hope my review has been useful.  Set-up was extremely easy.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "TanMan", "ReviewID": "RAA5UUVY7HP74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing TV. The picture is fantastic, as is the sound. Another reviewer here said the sound was lacking, but I have no idea what he was talking about. I have the TV mounted above the fireplace mantle, and the rear-facing speakers can bounce off the flat wall, so perhaps that's why mine sounds better.I got this TV primarily because it connects to my wireless 802.11n network (it supports both the 2.4GHz and 5Ghz bands), and it supports DLNA. I have an extensive video collection that I stream to my PS3's using software called PS3 Media Server. This is just a DLNA server, so I wanted a TV that could stream using my existing server. This TV fits that bill perfectly.The way you select the DLNA server is using the Source button on the remote. The DLNA server appears as a source, just like HDMI, DVI and PC. Once there, you just navigate the folders to find the video you want. It couldn't be easier.$1500 plus tax at Sam's Club.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Power Supply Issues", "Author": "jdornma", "ReviewID": "R31DN3KO7UWL2E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "No, I would not recommend this to a friend.So, this TV worked well for a few months, as others have described on the site... then it began to randomly power off several times per night. I generally don't use the TV remote for anything other than powering it on, so I'd have to go pick up the remote to turn it back on.When the problem first cropped up, I spent a few months trying to isolate the source... it appeared to be the TV, so I called for warranty service and Samsung sent a technician. The repair lasted less than three months before the powering off problem started all over again.And here's where it becomes fun: Samsung made me replace every piece of equipment attached to the TV: my DVR, my BluRay, my DVD/surround sound... insisting that the problem was one of my devices being incompatible with their superior TV. Yet, no matter what devices I connected, if anything at all was connected over an HDMI cable, the TV would power off.At that point, I replaced the TV with a Phillips LCD TV, and tried a Sharp TV as well. Both TV function flawlessly with all three devices connected over HDMI cables. However, swapping back to the Samsung TV finds that it continues to power itself off.After four months, and multiple technician visits, I was offered a refund for what appeared to be an irreparable issue. All I really wanted was a functioning TV, but Samsung's executive relations team denied my refund, and told me once again: it's not the TV, but it must be a \"source issue\" from the DVR. (Never mind that it occurs with multiple DVRs, multiple brands of BluRay players, multiple brands of DVD/Surround Sound systems.)I isolated the DVR by running it over coaxial cable, and suffering through low-definition TV for several weeks. It works fine, as long as none of the HDMI cables are connected. At which point, I reconnected my BluRay player and my DVD surround sound system. Once again, it randomly powered off several times in a night of watching TV. I unplugged the BluRay player, and continued to have the power cycle issue with just the DVD surround sound connected. I disconnected the DVD surround sound system, and plugged in the BluRay player and once again had the power cycle issue. If any device is connected over an HDMI cable, the TV powers itself off: multiple DVRs, multiple models of BluRay or DVD surround sounds... any device connected, whether powered on or not, results in the TV power cycling at random intervals.What good is an HD TV with single component input, if you cannot run any HD devices over an HDMI cable?I informed Samsung, and they told me that ALL of my devices are defective, but not their TV. They will not service the TV, will not replace it, will not refund me. I have spent money replacing equipment that they told me would fix the issue, but the only device that doesn't work is their TV.I was told that I was the only customer in the country to report an issue with the power supply on this TV (yet... their own website lists several other customers with power supply issues, and their own customer support rep told me that this was a known issue with this model). I guess it just became too expensive for them to own up to the issue.I will not only never buy another Samsung product, but I have reported their failure to address a defective product to the Better Business Bureau. I definitely do not recommend this product.Cons: Poor quality, Did not meet expectations, company fails to stand behind their product, will not fix issues, will blame anything but their equipment", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "R. Jackson", "ReviewID": "R1JTDRLC5B5KLX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I too purchased this TV at Costco and it included the wireless adapter which I think is a must to get the full worthiness of this tv.  Total cost with tax was $1613.00.  The only downside are the speakers, they suck but I plan on purchasing a receiver and surround sound speakers so that will remedy that issue.  I think I got a steal for under $2000 which is what I intended on paying.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV for the Price", "Author": "J. Battocletti \"Ellsswhere\"", "ReviewID": "R17YHH15RXZGJ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this set now for 6 months and I could not be happier. Went to Sams Club and saw display unit going for 1,100$. Snapped a photo of the serial number, went online to check manufacture date. The unit had left the factory 3 months prior to seeing it on the shelf. Went back to Sams and it was now marked down to 950$ Snatched it up but Sams could not locate wifi dongle. Contacted Samsung and emailed my receipt letting them know the issue. Samsung shipped out the dongle in 3 days time.Review:Picture quality of Samsung set is second to none. They make the most crisp and clear panels and it really shows when you stand them side by side with other brands. The thin form factor and bezel are amazing but the Flashight effect can clearly be seen in the corners if you look for it. When watching a movie or playing a game with dark scenes you will see this if you like staring at a 1 inch corner of the tv. The 240hz motion crap is worthless on this set as you must realize these displays have little computers in them that are interlacing frames or highlighting blacks etc and a 6000 series will have your cheapest processor. Anytime during true 1080p bluray use of these features actually destroys your picture quality with massive amounts of clipping and stuttering. I have ALL true motion and post processing turned off and the picture is stunning and has the added benefit of removing the 'soap opera effect' Keep in mind movies are shot at either 24fps or 30fps so a 120hz set is throwing 3 extra frames in every second to make motion 'seem smoother' which only really helps during sports.Wifi is nice for linking your phone or tablet/pc slideshow and video using Samsungs Allshare. Anything else (Netflix Pandora) is worthless for 2 reasons. Horribly slow (again slow computer in your this set) and most, myself included, have a ps3 xbox or computer hooked up to your tv these days which is 5 times faster and smoother. Menu on 'Smart Tv' leaves much to be desired and menu for settings is not great. Having true motion menu and other general backlight etc settings in two completely different drop downs is just stupid. After you have your display set the way you like it though its a non issue so a minor gripe.Speakers are okay but anyone who buys a tv in this day and age should know they are not really meant to be used. Like buying an mp3 player you are going to get cheap headphones with it just so you can actually use it out of the box but you should really buy something else. Anyone thinking different needs to consider the fact that speakers main goal is to make sound out of vibrations and you don't want your screen to vibrate... get something dedicated.Conclusion:Massive quality Samsung display at a dirt cheap price. Forget the 240hz crap and so called 'Smart Tv' and you have a killer image. I have friends and family that own their own sets and every single one of them (not exaggerating) has told me they love the Samsung display over any brand they have. Oh and if you want to see the 'soap opera effect' in all its glory watch a show like CSI or similar with a lot of close up dramatic lighting with all the true motion and edge highlight dynamic lighting etc on... it is glorious!", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's going back.", "Author": "Tom in San Diego \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R2V0ULJVHWSTEW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice picture.

I have a brick fireplace and wanted something that would fit in the area above the mantle. This Tv was perfect, about 3\" left over all the way around. Went to home depot bought the ryobi corded hammer drill and a set of bosch masonry bits for about $80. I was able to mount it with what was included in the box. The hammer drill is a must, don't bother with the cordless one for a $100 dollars more, unless you plan on using it a lot. I have surewest cable and internet. The cable is run through an onkyo receiver, then to the tv. I will say the tv did recognize the receiver so I can control the sound with the cable remote, which is very nice. Internet was easy to set up, with surewest's off brand piece of crap router. Picture is amazing, and I think surewest only broadcasts at 1080i, I haven't hooked up the blue ray yet, but when I do, I'm sure it will be fantastic. It replaced a 3 year old 37' lcd sony xbr, which cost me about the same price, so twice the screen size, better picture, less energy, same price. What a deal!!

With this model, some stations that broadcast in better quality look really nice on screen whereas others look pretty bad.
