{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Spectacular TV and service!!", "Author": "R. Glynn", "ReviewID": "R2Q4CT20MB6ZRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was originally going to buy a Kuro 50 inch plasma after looking at all the online reviews from many different sites.  The Samsung 650 was also ranked very high, but there were some small negatives about the tv (some glare issues primarily) that had me holding off for the Kuro.  Amazon originally had the Kuro for about 2k, but I didn't pull the trigger quick enough, and then it went away, and I couldn't find it anywhere for under $2,500.I wasn't sure if I was going to go ahead and buy the 650 when I looked on Amazon one day and saw the new 50 inch 760 on sale for $1,599.00.  After reading some professional reviews on this product (there wasn't a whole lot due to how new it was), I decided that this was an upgrade from the slightly older model, and decided to pull the trigger.  Best decision I could have made!  Not sure if experts still rank the Kuro higher than this television, but if they do, the Kuro must be out of this world, because this Samsung is UNBELIEVABLE.  This is my first plasma tv purchase, and I was used to watching television on a 36\" Panasonic traditional tv, but after seeing the picture on the Samung, I was blown away.  Watching sports on tv makes you feel as if you are at the event.  The color is amazing, the tv looks nice, and the swivel on the stand allows me to turn the tv to face me when my wife isn't around.  It even makes bad movies good (think Spiderman 3), awful movie, but awesome special effects in high def!  I think the sound was decent as well, but it didn't have enough booming bass for me, so with the money I saved over the Kuro, I purchased a Denon soundbar to go along with the plasma to add better surround sound and booming bass.  Now wherever I am seated in the room, I can turn my components to face me and enjoy a pretty good surround sound system.  If you don't want to add a surround sound system, this tv handled sound well, but as I say I was really looking for more booming bass when I watched movies.  It would have been great if there was a way to add a subwoofer directly to this television, something the Kuro has, but not the Samsung.There is a teeny glare on the OUTSIDE edge of the television on the part that is not actually the screen(not sure why Samsung made it almost a mirror like edge), but nothing that is too distracting, and I got used to it pretty quickly.  I have this in my living room which gets very little light when the shades are closed, but even with lights on, or during the day, the glare issue on this tv is not noticeable.  I was a little leary given past Samsung reviews, but I can tell you that if possible glare is holding you back from buying this tv, don't think twice about it...not an issue.  Also, you can watch this tv from anywhere in the room and see it clearly.  The controls on the remote are extremely functionable, and everything is VERY easy to setup and tweak.The other part of this purchase that is EXTREMELY important, and should be emphasized, is the process of buying DIRECTLY through Amazon.com.  As long it is directly through Amazon.com (and not through an affiliate), shipping is included in the price, and the company handling the deliveries is TOP NOTCH.  When I initially looked around for purchase possibilities, the thing that bothered me was that most companies had a policy where they would deliver the plasma to your front door only.  You had to open the box, make sure that it worked, and then sign for it.  If there was any type of problem, some would tell you to refuse delivery, and others would tell you that you had to get it fixed through the warranty process!  The last thing I wanted to do was to get a defective set, and then have to get someone here to fix it!  When I went with Amazon.com, the company delivering for them brought the plasma into my house, took it out of the box, put it on the open table, hooked it up, put batteries in the remote, setup the initial configuration, and made sure that it was working fine BEFORE I signed for it.  This piece of mind often called \"white glove service\" elsewhere costing anywhere from $100 - $150 additional dollars was ABSOLUTELY free with Amazon.com.  I can't stress enough how important this was.  I had read about this service beforehand, and it was a primary reason (along with cost) as to why I was pretty much holding off until I found the right television on Amazon.  This service alone made my purchase through Amazon.com worth the price over other services, but the price was also also at the lower range of ANYWHERE else.  A friend of mine owns an electronics store, and told me point blank that he doesn't understand how Amazon.com can price merchandise the way they do it, but he had heard good things about them, and although it would hurt him by recommending Amazon.com, he told me to buy from them if the price was right.I highly recommend this television as well as purchasing from Amazon.com.  The final way you know how happy I am with this purchase is to keep the following in mind....I RARELY spend the time to enter reviews after purchases, but I was so happy with this purchase, that I couldn't wait to share my experience with everyone on Amazon.com", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung PN50A760", "Author": "Santa Fe railfan \"baduga\"", "ReviewID": "R3MWY9ZZU5N3A5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a great experience all around. Not only does the 50\" Samsung plasma have a beautiful picture, it also has enough inputs for a number of peripherals, ie, Wii, karaoke, BluRay, DVR, and older DVD/VCR player. I had a hard time locating this particular model but Amazon had one via VANN's. My only complaint is that none of the TVs I looked at mentioned that you need extra cables to connect the various peripherals. The quick-connect instructions accompanying the TV gives a list of several different cables available, and lists these in \"good, better, best\" format for picture quality.", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Crummy Picture, Broke Right After Warranty", "Author": "Jeffrey P. Simmons \"seesawheart\"", "ReviewID": "R2H0XTS8N1ZMME", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The picture doesn't compare with newer, less expensive brands out there. It doesn't have the clarity or depth you see if newer LCDs. Often the picture needs to \"catch up\" with images on the screen. After the 3 year warranty was up, it started getting black horizontal lines on the screen. Samsung does not admit this is a defect that plagues many of there TVs though look around, everyone is beginning to see this issue. An expensive TV that only lasted 3 years. Sorry, that's not acceptable. Don't buy Samsung. Go buy a Vizio or Panasonic.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "madisonroamer", "Author": "madisonroamer", "ReviewID": "RK3C87PVO1W4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung PNA760 50\" plasma television is amazing and Amazon White Glove delivery is top notch.The White Gloves Delivery man and I unpack the television, placed it atop my entertainment center, plug it end, and turned it on.  The picture was incredible without any adjustments.  We currently have 4 flat screen televisions in our home, two LCDs and two Plasmas.  Although the LCDs are excellent televisions, they pale in comparison to the two plasmas.  The primary differences are motion blur and black level.My only negative comment concerning the PNA760 50\" plasma is reflection glare.  Probably would not want to place this Television in a brightly lighted room without heavy curtains to block out ambient light sources while viewing.  In a dark room this television is perfect in all aspects.  I highly recommend Amazon's white glove delivery too.", "Date": "April 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "Adam L.

Another nice feature is being able to connect to your home network & watch picture, movies, & listen to music all without a media center extender. Amazon shipped the item very quickly & it arrived at the delvery hub by VESA. VESA, on the other hand, held on to the item for about two weeks without calling to set up a date to deliver. I had to call Amazon & ask why they were not delivering, needless to say it was delivered the next day. Other than the contractor amazon uses, it was a great experience.", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung 50\" Plasma HDTV", "Author": "L.

This is my third Samsung Plasma.  I put this one in my bedroom.  Only problem is the heat it generates while in use.  Add to it a cable box, receiver, and blu-ray player and it generates about 90%.  Had to install a air return behind the unit.  Picture is fantastic.

Maite \"I love books\"", "ReviewID": "RYC147PJM4KQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My whole family is in love with this TV. After looking at any number of TVs, on display and those owned by neighbors and friends, we chose the Samsung and haven't looked back. There are all kinds of input options, including quite a few HDMI inputs, which means that video components and game consoles can all stay plugged in without any juggling around, and the cord keeper on the back of the set keeps the cables all but entirely out of sight.The picture quality is terrific, especially for sports events, and the sound quality, while not able to match surround sound, is perfectly acceptable.The one caveat is the Touch of Color. It happens to works very well in our room, but might not be for everyone. The red color borders the black in the clear edges around the base and picture frame, and is very contemporary and cool looking, but is actually not that noticeable. Samsung told me that some people rig a can light behind the set to make the red effect more noticeable. The one aspect of the Touch of Color with which I was unaware is the red cast to the screen. When you are used to big black screens, it's a bit of a surprise. Although it is not terribly noticeable when the TV is on, it is quite evident when the TV is off and might not work with every style of decor. Whether or not it was designed to do so, the red cast is actually very helpful in reducing screen glare if your TV happens to catch any glare from daylight coming into the room.All in all, this is a beautiful set with great quality and options for picture fit that increase with the type of cable used (HDMI having the most options and the best picture quality). The TV and remote are very easy to figure out, so much so that you hardly need the manual. In addition, Samsung customer service was helpful, very knowledgeable and seemed happy to walk me through whatever questions I had about the set.We could not be any happier with this purchase.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "hmmm", "Author": "Giorgi Kazakhashvili", "ReviewID": "RCTWZJG077S63", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "come on guys, first watch Sony, Philips, Panasonic, Sharp, Pioneer TVs(new Models), Samsung is the worst chois in the world, everybody knows this, All Professionals will Agree that Sony has the best Colors in the worldP.S.sorry for bad English :)", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001H4Q3KE"}}
