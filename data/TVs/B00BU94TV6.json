It's 50% brighter -- excellent for a well lit room  The edge lighting doesn't produce the diamond pattern on bright, solid color backgrounds  The screen corners are not dark  The bezel is very small. It feels like it's nothing but screen.  It's a better looking TV from a furniture perspective.  It has 3D (not a big deal to me)  The 3D glasses are blue tooth so you don't need to keep them pointed at the TV to maintain sync  Better IR sensitivity. The 732 was a bit picky about having the remote pointed in the right place  10 point temperature calibration  The OOTB default color calibration wasn't too bad in Movie modeCons  The battery in the 3D glasses isn't rechargeable.It's necessary to buy a battery every 100 hours (according to the manual)  Flash lighting in the 4 corners. In my case, it actually looks more like corner clouding than traditional flash lighting. With my backlight set at -10 (at night), the corners aren't a problem, even in very dark scenes.  Like all edge lit sets, the center of the screen isn't as bright as the edges. However, it takes a long exposure photo to see this issue.  The Color Management has some issues. It's been impossible for me to get the blue primary calibrated correctly and still maintain the correct blue luminance.  The Motion Enhancement settings above 120 High seem to affect color and gamma in ways that I find unacceptable. 240Hz in particular should be avoided  Moving contrast higher than 32 is going to start effecting colors. The set runs out of red at that point and your luminance balance will be off.  Slight less contrast (using the ANSI contrast grid) than the 732. I haven't noticed this in watching TV, however.  It's 50 pounds heavier than the 70\" 732", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Satisfied!", "Author": "McCr8", "ReviewID": "RA3O458PZIO92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had been holding off for a few years to purchase a new TV to replace our 60\" Rear projection TV. (which served it's time perfectly for nearly 11 years).After extensive research, comparisons, and reading the many reviews of this TV and other TV's in this category (Samsung 7100 series, Panasonic T60, Vizio M series, and Sony XBR)...the decision was made to go with this one due to: Cost value; Sharp's reputation for large screens, phyical appearance, and the calibration options.Cost Value:We were willing to pay the price for the Samsung unit, but this seemed like the better value being about $500 less.On the other hand, it was $500 more than the Vizio M series which many people think is a better value.But with more options to tweak, the Sharp was the final choice since we could make deaper adjustments if there were any complaints.Many reviewers on various technical forums seem to think the Sharp 'Quattron' and 'Aquomotion' settings are just an unnecessary marketing ploy.  Although that could be true to a degree, I'd rather have the option than not.Appearance:This TV is beautiful to look at even when it's off.  It's like a nice piece of furniture. The Wallpaper option is also a nice touch if you have company and don't want the TV on.  It's not make or break though.Viewing:The appearance off is nice, but it's about what the picture looks like when on that counts.Out the box (connecting to Directv HD Receiver), the picture was ok, but definitely needed adjustments.  Using settings from other tech sites and forums, I changed a few settings and was immediately pleased. (coming form a 60\" 60hz LCD Rear pro...this was to be expected).  The Directv picture was good,but it still wasn't 100% what I was expecting.  But then I put in a Bluray (via PS3)...and then I knew we made the right decision!  It was perfect.  Very bright and the colors are amazing.  Especially Reds and Yellow.  And even blacks, considering this is an LED and not a Plasma.Random settings:Using the 'Movie Mode' and viewing normal TV at the 120hz High setting.  But I switch to 240hz when watching sports.Most complain about the so called \"Soap Opera\" effect these TVs with higher refresh rates have.  This can be turned off via the Film Mode option.  But personally, I actually like the effect depending upon what is being viewed.  A live concert gives you the feeling you  are in the stadium with the Film Mode on.  But watching a movie...it is too much.Other than that, some of the detailed color and gamma setting have been adjusted, but nothing too drastic yet.  I will eventually use one of the calibrations discs to do further tweaking.  But it's more than pleasing right now.Extras:The Smart Tv options are nice.  But most of these apps I prefer using from my Apple TV.  However, I think overtime, I may like the convenience of watching direct from the TV.  Especially the HULU app.Web browing is nice and looks pleasant, but I don't see myself doing a lot of browing on the TV.Internet connection is perfect.  My connection spead is 23Mbs and I have a lot of gadgets connected in the house.3D:I'd love the TV without it and there is not much content to watch.  But it does look nice.  Especially on Bluray.  Pretty fun for when guests are over.CON(kind of):The only negative experience so far is, one particular channel from our Directv was not synced with the audio and picture.  Oddly, this happens only on that channel.  Changed multiple settings and only had a slight improvement.  This is our local CBS channel.But...while watching NFL on Sunday via the Sunday Ticket...I watched several games on the other CBS feeds and there was no syncing issue.  This led me to believe that it was just an issue with my local CBS.After a couple of weeks of viewing I honestly think the syncing has improved though.  (this could just me mentally thinking it's improved, but...I'm not as annoyed anymore so...I'm keeping the 5 star rating because I think it is a DTV issue).Amazon experience:I've never purchased a TV or other large purchase on-line before.  But I knew what I was getting in the TV.  However, I did not know how the delivery experience would be.  The free Standard shipping option worked out perfectly.  I ordered on a Thursday and scheduled the delivery for the following Thursday.  They showed up within the 3 hour window provided.  Unboxed, installed the TV on it's stand and plugged it in to make sure it work.  They also took all the trash away.And lastly, I just happened to click on Amazon.com, exactly a week after purchasing the TV, just to read some other peoples reviews on the unit.  To my surprise, I noticed the price was now $500 less than purchased.  I clicked on the Amazon \"found at a cheaper price\" option, and was notified in 24 hrs that I would be refunded the difference.  Awesome! Especially when the price has now gone back up slightly.Overall impressed with the TV and find myself watching movies again like they are new.This is a morelengthy review than I expected to write and I'm not one to write reviews.  But hopefully this will help someone else looking to make a purchase (or not).", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazed at the picture quality on the 70\" 857 HDTV from Sharp!", "Author": "B. Coomer", "ReviewID": "RW9295U8M0Z1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Below are some key points to consider and why I chose this HDTV (Sharp LC-70LE857).1) First, in observing the ratings at the time of my review, 6 of 8 people who provided ratings less than 4 stars did not even buy their Sharp HDTV from Amazon (they are not listed as Amazon verified purchases).  Who knows if they even purchased this exact TV at all, and why would someone give a review on Amazon if they didn't buy it from Amazon and go through shipping experience, etc.  If you are going to write a review on Amazon (or give negative feedback), then you should at least have purchased it from Amazon.  For all we know these folks could have bought a product off eBay labeled new that was actually refurbished, or they could work for a Sharp competitor.  Just saying...Be cautious of any review on Amazon where the reviewer did not purchase the product from Amazon..2) We purchased this HDTV in August 2013 off Amazon.com, and after more than 2 months we have had no issues.3) Our first HDTV was a 46\" in 2005, and by coincidence was a Sharp Aquos that had the best specs and ratings at the time.  We have had no problems with that HDTV after 8 years, and at a time larger HDTVs were just coming out and I had several friends with bad experiences from other brands.  Though I don't consider myself a \"Sharp person\" (no pun intended), Sharp has been a great experience for us.4) My biggest concern about purchasing a 70\" HDTV is MPG compression, and the distance we sit from the TV.  To achieve greater through-put, broadcasters and/or the video content provider will increase the MPG compression, which also physical distorts the images just like JPG.  It's particularly noticeable around sharp edges such as text on the screen.  If you are too close to the TV, you will see the distortion around the edges of letters displayed, such as the right angle point of an L.  There is typically a guide that you should sit so far from an HDTV for a given size.  Contrary to what your parents told you about your eyes growing up, this is not health related, but rather so the MPG distortion blends at a greater distance and you don't notice it.  We sit 10 feet from our TV, and our 2005 46\" TV was certainly victim to this rule; however, this latest technology HDTV from sharp is incredible!  The 70\" HDTV's processors blend and eliminate the distortion.  In fact, the recommended viewing distance for 3D on this TV is 8 feet.5) Consumer reports stated at the time we purchased the TV that Sharp has the most advanced manufacturing facilities of any brand.  Sony and Samsung are really good, but I agree with Consumer reports that Sharp is the best (at least at the times that we've been in the market for HDTVs for 46\" or better)6) Looking at TVs in stores are demos and made to look best under the store lighting and not in your home, but it's still a good comparison side by side, which we liked the 70\" Sharp the best, but the stores here did not carry the top end 70\" Sharp with the extra brightness (Sharp LC-70LE857).  There is a lot of light in our room and wanted the extra brightness; glad we did.7) The hardest colors for LED HDTVs to display is red and yellow.  Sharp has always been known to display great reds(one reason we bought our first Sharp); however, most LED HDTVs make up the picture with red, green, and blue (ie, making up the primary color yellow without a true yellow pixel), but this HDTV has the quattron technology that allows it to display a perfect yellow, and if you look real close, you can see the pixels are made up of red, green, blue, and yellow (4 colors instead of the typical 3).8) Black is also difficult for all TVs because black is the absence of light, and TVs are trying to create a picture using light.  The Dynamic contrast ratio is the HDTV's ability to produce dark blacks.  Our first HDTV was 10,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, and only Sony had a 8,000:1 at the time we bought it in 2005.  Now most decent HDTVs have over 1,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio and it's not a great problem today.  Most TVs that appear to have a light, washed out picture, is because the dynamic contrast ratio is very low.9) The motion is non-blur at 240Hz, but then again, I watch NFL football and tennis, and I really didn't notice much difference from our 60Hz HDTV from 2005.10) There is a really neat wallpaper mode that can display your own pictures or have really nice stock art pictures that can display one or rotate through.  Since we removed the mantel and mounted the HDTV over our fireplace, it does add a nice appeal than just seeing a big black box.  They say it's very low power, but I'm not sure the exact watts.11)  We mounted the HDTV into the mortar over our fireplace with a VideoSecu Tilt TV Wall Mount kit from Amazon.  This kit was very impressive, steel, lots of screws for different needs, level, and a 10ft HDMI cable.  The 70\u201d weights right about 100lbs.12) We had a Sony Blu-Ray player that supported 3D, but this is our first 3D HDTV, and I wasn't sure if I needed a Sony 3D broadcaster or what like in the older days...This HDTV ships with 2 3D glasses, and other than tuning the 3D glasses with the HDTV, there was literally nothing I had to do in order to get the 3D working.  Simply connected the Sony Blu Ray, placed a 3D disc in, the HDTV autodetected 3D, and it simply worked.  The glasses use CR2025 batteries, which I bought a backup 5 pack of Maxell lithiums off Amazon for $1.89 w/free ship.  Ratings say the glasses get around 100 hours of viewing time off a battery.  One thing I have learned about 3D on Blu-Ray, not all are the same...When at the movies, the 3D projects outward, and I remember watching the first of Avatar and feeling like a water droplet was right close to my nose.  Avatar 3D on Blu-Ray does not project outward like that, but rather it projects inward.  More like looking into a 3D box than being at the movies; however, this is not the fault or capability of the HTDV.  This difference (and why most people are not in love with 3D on TVs) is due to the producers, because at the start of The Guardians 3D on Blu-Ray, when you start the movie, Jack Frost hits a snow flake and it does project out of this HTV and into your face.13) Being highly technical and detailed, I tune the heck out of everything from my TV to stereo, car radio, etc...Though after going through all the tuning settings for this TV, I only changed a couple of settings (I believe the default refresh was 120Hz and I changed it to 240Hz), and found most all the coloration was pretty much set very well out of the box.14) Sound was irrelevant since I use a surround sound receiver.Overall, we are VERY happy with this HDTV, and as expected, everyone compliments it, even people who have large HDTVs.  Too, with the 70\u201d, others have also commented that people on the TV such as in interviews, look life size.  We almost went with a 55\u201d, but now I\u2019m so glad we went again and bought a 70\u201d.  We settled on the 70\u201d versus larger simply because this HDTV is about 1.5\u201d wider than our fireplace.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "White Lines In Letterbox Movies", "Author": "moviefan", "ReviewID": "RHRQN757X4BGZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love this TV so far. This version just came out in March and has the latest technology in parts. One thing to consider if you are a moviephile like me, though.  Any letterbox movie Bluray or broadcast will have an irritating white line imbedded around the picture in dot by dot viewing mode.  The only way to  to correct this is to switch to zoom mode, taking half of the movie away with it . It has to do with what pixels are being displayed and what the TV detects. Sharps says it is in within the specs and that all letterbox movies should be displayed in full screen mode  to remove the white lines. This sucks. If the movie is in letterbox , it's for a reason.  Zoom up Ben-Hur?  Chariot scene is lost. My Samsung DLP TV never had this problem. Be warned, fellow moviephiles.

The split screen feature where you can watch TV and surf the internet is much more useful than I expected.  The 3D with bluetooth glasses is also amazing.  The picture of this set is far superior to my XBR2 Sony Bravia and I am having no lip sync issues what so ever. I also checked the AVSForum to see if anyone else is having this issue and couldn't find anyone reporting this.  I think the previous reviewer reporting this may have a bad HDMI board and should get his TV replaced.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Massive in every way", "Author": "Kid_Again", "ReviewID": "R9TYS71CWQHNP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is so large that the wall hanging bracket is heavier than my 65\" plasma TV.Other than the fact that this TV decides for itself where it wants to go, the product is outstanding.  I am no a/v geek so I'm just running it on the default settings and the performance is spectacular.  I wasn't sure whether going upscale to the Aquos model was worth the money but I saw this and the base model running side-by-side but the shadows run much deeper with the Aquos.  I also could make myself believe I saw a bit of juddering on the cheaper model.  I think I would have been OK with the cheaper model but I'm over the top with this.  A benefit is that it sits in the basement rec area and I can shut the lights off on that side of the room.The audio system is not bad at all. I suppose the engineers had a bit more space in the frame to fit larger speakers?.  Did I say this thing is massive?I'll get the best settings from some place like CNET and fiddle with it down the road.  Interestingly, CNET didn't give the Aquos a great rating; it was a good rating.  I usually follow their advice carefully but this TV is absolutely worth the bucks.I bought the Avatar 3D BluRay disk and temporarily hooked up a two speaker-only stereo system and everyone who's seen it is blown away.The only two points that I would note are the two 3D glasses that come with the set are not rechargeable.  I bought two extra Sharp rechargeable glasses BUT they only come with a universal cable and NO CHARGER.  Now, that is cheap.Second, I was surprised to see there is no audio-out RCA plugs in the back for those who like a less brittle sound than the new audio equipment.I haven't hooked up the home theater system yet because I'm running old second-gen transistor audio equipment and have ordered an HDMI-to-RCA phone plug cable. Probably not a concern for 99% of the people who might buy this.Minor concerns, really.Also, the TV found our wireless network easily and we immediately got to Netflix.I'll need sun block if I watch this thing too much.Invite your biggest friends over for a few brewskis to lift this puppy onto the wall mount.  BTW, I had access to the back of my drywall and put the mounting lag bolts through 2x4 cross studs that I screwed to the vertical studs.  I would not mount this on plain drywall as I think the combined weight of the TV and bracket may be around two hundred pounds.Edit....AHEM! Now that I actually READ the instructions, I note that the glasses will charge off the mini USB cable when it's plugged into the back of the TV and the TV is on.

I did a lot of shopping around for tv's and this is what I ended up going with in the end. The tv has very bright colors (thanks to the super bright), are vivid, blacks look black and whites look white.I did run the Disney Wow calibration disc which helped a lot with getting the colors where they should be. I highly recommend getting some kind of calibration disc rather then just using the built in settings Sharp gives you. Most either have washed out colors, sharpness is a bit off, etc..I used movie mode myself and tweaked it from there and am impressed with the results.Don't forget this set has a 12,000:1 contrast ratio not a 10,000:1 like most other tv's.I had 0 issues out of the box. No flash lighting, no banding, no light bleed, etc..The Aquamotion 240 (which is really 120) works well with helping prevent as much motion blur as possible. The 960 is only good for fast motion sports. It's to much for normal tv and really bad for movies. You can get the so called soap opera effect if you use it all of the time so it's best to only use it on sports if you have to.Apps work great for me and one great advantage of having a Sharp is the screen is semi matte and not semi gloss. This helps really well with reflections.Sharp uses active 3D and it is amazing on this set. The 3D glasses are bluetooth so there are no worries about having to keep your head pointed at the tv to keep it paired. They only give you 2 glasses which is one down fall and really the main reason I gave this tv 4 stars instead of 5.A lot of people don't know it, but on a lot of the newer Samsung tv's such as the 7100, Samsung is using Sharp panels on them. You have to look at the label on the back of the tv and look at the numbers which will let you know if its a Sharp or Samsung panel.A reviewer on here complained about white lines on letter box movies. I do not get this.Some have mentioned lip sync issues. I do not have any at all and I'm going from my set top box and blu ray players directly into my old Sony surround sound receiver.The sound on the tv is bad. Sounds like a single mono speaker, but this is the norm with edge lit tv's these days that's why it's best to use an external system with it.The remote control is long, but pretty basic and simple. I personally use a Logitech Harmony remote so I have no use for the stock remote.Overall I am really impressed with the tv and hope it lasts as long as my last one did.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Owned TV for close to a year nice TV , Poor Customer service, on 3rd TV", "Author": "Victor", "ReviewID": "RYU2GI4EL523A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "These 80\" screens have major issues.1st TV went bad , 2 months in.

One thing you must note when dealing with Sharp HDTV's is they have 3 different product series, and there is a noticeable quality difference between them.  I know this now having bought one of each series and compared them.My original 52\" was an 8 series.  I recently bought a 60\" 6 series on sale at Best Buy for $899.  It wasn't at all comparable to my previous 8 series in clarity and brightness.  I took it back and upgraded to the 7 series.  It was better and would likely be fine for anyone who previously had not seen the 8 series.  My friends thought it as a great picture.  However, when I ran both TV's (7 and 8 series) side by side there is a noticeable brightness difference in the 8 series over the 7 series, along with other clarity comparisons.  You wouldn't know this unless you've seen them both side by side.Anyway, I took it back again and tried to buy this particular 8 series on sale, but it was recently discontinued at Best Buy for the new incoming 2014 models.  I was then able to find it on Amazon through one of their selling partners, and am so glad I did.  Now I have the quality level I had come to expect from Sharp with vivid brightness and infinite adjustability.  This is a 240Hz 3D version which although isn't necessary, it's nice to have.  The TV has a built-in web browser which is functional, but tedious to use.  It also has many other built-in apps such as Netflix, Facebook, Hulu, etc, etc., all of which are easy to access and use.  It's really a great TV with stunning visuals for the price range.  I've been running my previous Sharp 52\" for three years with no problems, and to this day I'd compare it's quality to being better than almost any other HDTV of that era.  This new 60\" is the same.  Just make sure you get the 8 series so that you can enjoy the whitest whites, deepest reds, and images that seem to explode off the screen.  It's worth the extra money, but still comes in at less than many comparable Samsung or Sony TV's.  I got my LC-60LE857U on sale for $1,572 and it was shipped free from CA along with not having to pay sales tax.  It's a great looking unit too.  Slim, sleek, and doesn't look cheap like many of their competitors.  Great deal!

Elsewhere on these product reviews and other Amazon forums, customers have complained about the shipping of such a large TV,  and how it was unreliable, showed up days late, lack of communication, etc. I had the exact opposite experience, and because I was anxious about purchasing an item of this cost and size from Amazon, I felt I should add a positive review for others that are contemplating the purchase.During the purchase process, I was offered a calendar to choose a delivery timeframe. The shipping company, CEVA, was fantastic: tracking updates were accurate, and when I called them directly to confirm my delivery time, they were very helpful.  Product arrived within the first hour of the delivery window, two gentlemen brought it into the house. Packaging was in pristine condition. After unboxing and testing it, that was it. From the negative reviews of CEVA, I admit that I was really quite nervous. This was simply not my experience.One other note: Amazon has a team that watches/tracks large/expensive purchases and will reach out to you personally to let you know they are available if anything looks awry or goes wrong. That was a nice touch. They texted me when it was delivered to ensure I was satisfied with everything.An excellent experience overall - and the TV is just stunning of course.Last note: very surprised how well old movies (non-hd) looked on this screen.

Zuteck", "ReviewID": "R3T3WP4M2VYFVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This rating is primarily about the picture, since a screen this large is likely to be used in a home theater, with a separate sound system.  The built in, small, down-firing speakers are OK for watching the evening news, but they don't come close to matching the picture.  Note that I adjusted Film/advanced from 7 -> 0, as many reviews have suggested, to get rid of the \"soap opera\" effect.  Sharp now sets contrast to +32 out of the box, the top level various reviews endorse, and I support that.  The negative side of the sharpness scale is functional and will blur a good image - leave it at zero.  This set should not be fed a signal so poor it needs negative settings.The power consumption of this set is phenomenally low.  The energy star label rates it at $23/year power cost, off scale low on a scale running from $39 to $90, that includes 70\" diagonal sets.  I measured the energy directly with a power meter, and it was 80-90 watts with afternoon sunlight coming in our cathedral windows, dropping to a bit below 50 watts in a dark room at night, with internal speakers on.  50 watts - and its enough light that you can walk around the room and find things, no small room light needed to break the dark.  It hardly seems possible for that big a screen to be that bright, and if I'd not seen and measured it in person, I'd not have believed it.We screened Avatar from BluRay as a test of its abilities, and the detail rendering was excellent.  Plan on using HDMI for all your inputs - even though cable isn't the highest quality feed, the blacks were distinctly muddy when I tried to drive it via the component video feed, as I'd done our prior 60\" Sony; all that size and detail rendering is merciless on signal feeds that aren't top notch, as you will see the feed shortfalls.We've had the set for less than a month, so this is enough for now, except to note Sharp is one of the few makers that provide a no-glare screen in this size range.

The speakers in the rear are horrendous, and even though it sounds nice with the \"built in subwoofer,\" it is beyond flimsy and even at 100 (the highest volume setting) it is barely audible. What's worse is that once mounted on the wall, the sound directly vibrates off the surface, and creates a bit of an echo. This really shouldn't be a huge concern though, everyone who spends $3,000 on a massive 70'' HDTV probably already has a surround sound.PROS:-Super thin, and doesn't create a lot of heat-Amazing picture, only with the MOTION ENHANCEMENT OFF (why on EARTH all these companies want to inject dynamic motion control into TVs is beyond my wildest imagination. It totally strips the cinematic feel from a movie, and makes it look like robotic low-budget home movies dripping in cheesy one-dimensional cinematic vomit)-I like that it has both bluetooth and wifi (just make sure if you use the TVs Native Netflix etc apps, you'll want to run an optical audio cable to your receiver to get sound)CONS:-Like I said, the speakers are basically obligatory, and are as flimsy and worthless as you can possible fathom-My specific TV arrived with a dead pixel right in the middle of the screen, bright white at all times, but after a few phone calls and a few emails to Amazon, they took some steps with some prodding to rectify the situation for me-There are only ONE type of Sharp glasses made for this TV, and they are bluetooth, and REQUIRE a watch-type battery (not rechargeable), which seems odd to me.

It is one of the better panels I have seen, which is the main reason I bought this unit.  Other units will push up the brightness to mask out the lack of dynamic range.  The 4 star rating is mainly for the panel.  I would give the other (lack of) features 1 or 2 stars.Other than the panel, the rest of the features on this unit is very much lacking compared to my smaller Samsung and older Sony.  This is based on my usage which is over the air TV using an antenna and not cable or satellite.First, the response time is poor.  Changing channels can sometime lag quite a bit, especially if the reception is poor and it is trying to lock onto the channel.  In that case the TV will not response until it returns an error message, which can be a quite a few seconds.  This can be annoying if the channel signal is weak.  My Sony and Samsung response much much much quicker in changing channels even for weak signals.Channel menu is lacking.  It does not allow the user to edit added channels from the scan.  In my case it picked up two 4.1 channels, one a Philadelphia independent station and the other WNBC in NYC.  I am not able to delete the independent station or de-select it from the channel up/down buttons (this station signal is weak and not watchable, and see my comments above about the slow response).  This feature is available on both the Sony and the Samsung units.Content summary - My Samsung unit has a lot more information such as description of the show, the name, the duration and how much more time it has, the next show, etc.  This unit pretty much just shows the name of the current show.Channel scan - Sony has one features that neither this unit nor Samsung has.  Sony unit retains the scanned channels list and allows new scans to add to this list without wiping out the entire list.  This can be useful when stations fade in and out.

The picture is on par with others out there. The apps can actually be useful and convenient.

It changes between sources and sometimes it seems even channels on the satellite dish. I can compensate in large part for this by running sources through my Yamaha receiver and adjusting the audio delay. Unfortunately, the delays often change between sources and it requires constant changing, auto-correct doesn't seem to cut it. There's also nothing I can do about the audio coming through the tv speakers from things like the netflix app. Adding insult to injury is the fact my receiver was released immediately prior to the 3D craze and can't run the 3D signal through it. So I can have either 3D or in-sync audio.I've tried contacting Sharp and they have very little to say or suggest about a pretty widely known issue.

As far as quattron goes im not exactly sure what it does but when you walk up to the tv very close up it doesn't get very blurry it still shows clear so im guessing the quarttron adding the 2 million extra subpixels is not a gimmick because the picture is still clear when you get up close.

I went from a really nice Toshiba Regza 46\" to this 60\" Sharp. I also moved in the process, and now have TV through another service (Comcast to Time Warner Cable). I will say I see a lot of pixels and distortion while watching TV. I blame this on the TWC service being over compressed, but I'm really not sure. It could be that a bigger TV means that things get stretched. I don't have a BluRay player so I cannot test a really high def signal to be sure.The TV itself looks really nice and the menus are easy enough to navigate.

But I was impressed with the setup, installation, packaging and out of the box experience. The sound is also really good. This is for my dad, so no stereo, just what comes out of the box. The picture looks amazing. I was a little suprised at the limited non-HDMI inputs. Although I can work around that (throw away the old DVD player and use a Blu Ray HDMI player, I guess I still expected S-video inputs and more than one analog input on the back. But I am not surprised in hindsight. If that is an issue, then look at the specs carefully. I also can say that I bought it from Walt's TV in Arizona, not the default Amazon Prime. I found them very helpful and ready to go. They called to confirm the shipping address (thank goodness since I wanted it shipped to my dad!), and the delivery company was good (not great). The shipper let it sit in their dock for a day and then didn't give me a heads up that they were showing up. And this is important when you ship something so big.

He said to look at the Sharp AQUOS, which is only 60\" and up. After having a dismal experience trying to buy through Frys I thought I would look and see what was available on Amazon since I've always had such stellar service and products through them. Not only did I discover a more updated model than that offered at Fry's but a great price. Since I've become a member of Prime, there could be no better time than this to take advantage of the free shipping. I also purchased the stand for the TV but that's a different product and review. Anyway, the TV came when scheduled, the delivery was great and the delivery guy brought it into the house and put it exactly where I wanted it. I had my TV guy come and set it up for me after I assembled the stand and got things ready. OMG!!! I can't believe the picture on this TV, it's absolutely astounding. I've had the set now for about a month and I think I've watched more TV in that time than I had in the previous year. Phenomenal picture and sound. I absolutely love this TV. I'm comfortable enough that I've chunked up and disposed of the packaging already (hope that doesn't jinx it :)). Football, golf and some of these TV shows that are in HD make you feel like you're right there with them. Got two pair of 3D glasses also but haven't tried that. I've got the set all ready so I can use it with the internet once my new laptop shows up. Okay, enough gushing, just know that this is an outstanding TV. I hope I never have to use the 3 year extended warranty I purchased with it. I am now a solid Sharp AQUOS fan. You should be too.

I used the suggestion from Avsforums for the LC80LE857 settings. You may have to search for it but it did wonders for my colors and clouding issues.The first and foremost thing I want from a TV this large(LC80LE857U) and Expensive is Picture Quality and it lacks this in a big way. The colors are so washed out most non HD Content looks washed out and that is where the Clouding shows up on this TV and makes it look like you are watching it using bad Rabbit Ears.I am using DISH Networks 722 receiver. Even in HD the colors are very flat compared to my 58 Inch Samsung Plasma.***THIS TV IS NOT SO SHARP***Yes, It is Huge and the picture pops out at you. The whites are so white they are almost unbearable. The Blacks are fine I don't look for blacks to be so dark you cannot see anything. As someone said you almost need Sunblock if you sit too close and watch scenes that have a lot of white. Have not seen where the 4th color makes any difference.I have not used any of the Apps.The Remote is OK.So Again the BIGGEST CON and a deal breaker for me is the COLOR Quality and the Clouding. I did see Lip Sync on it especially when the dialogue is fast not so bad when they speak at a normal pace.I bought it from a local retailer in Plano (M***A) and would never buy from them again because their return policy sucks. These days it is becoming so hard to buy expensive electronics because the return policy of most retailers sucks and the restocking price is unbearable so if you buy it you keep it :-) :-).If you need a picture that pops on the Screen with SHARP colors I would not recommend this TV. Make sure you watch a lot of Non HD content on it before you make your decision.One thing though, because of the bad reviews the price of this TV is almost palatable.The Wired Network Connection worked without a hitch and I was able to connect to the Internet easily.
