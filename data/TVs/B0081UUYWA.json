The value for this price is outstanding and I am very happy with the purchase.The unit came boxed well and was undamaged despite the UPS driver pointing out a big tear in the carton. The interior padding saved the day! The setup was easy and everything in the QuickStart guide and manual was easy to understand.- Picture quality is a solid 9. The crispness and color are very good and very life-like.- Over-the-Air signal quality is also very good, I'd give it an 8+.- Audio is not super, but I havene't messed around with the equalizer settings myself, like many other reviewers reccomend. Persoanlly I plan to use my surround receiver for any movies/bluray output. Built in speakers get a 6 rating, as alone they are a bit low and occasionally tinny.- Connections get a 7, as I'd like a digital audio IN...however to be fair I knew that wasn't there when buying. And for this price I can understand why they have what they have.Overall rating 8+ for this TV, at week 5. Buy with confidence.

Dont get me wrong, its not up there with the Samsungs that are 3 times the price as this one. But for the money, I was overly impressed. The picture quality is stunning in full HD 1080p, and believe me, I have a skeptical eye. I own a CCTV distribution company and I used this in my showroom to display some of our Hi-Def 1080p cameras. My cameras look better on this monitor than any other that I have seen. The colors are so bright and vibrant and the blacks are very black. We have an expensive Samsung 52\" at home and I would venture to say that this one's picture quality is on par with that one. Any of the other posters who complained of bad video quality were probably not using an HDMI connection. Rather, they were probably using a component connection and expecting HDTV quality, not gonna happen. This was so good that I just ordered another one for our showroom and I am considering the 50\" version from the same company.

You shouldn't expect Ferrari performance from a Hyundai - the world doesn't work like that.The same applies here. The TV is a fantastic value for what it offers.The \"out of the box\" experience is dull. The TV is pre-configured to \"power save\" mode when you first turn it on, meaning that the you might disappointed with the dark tones and overall unexciting image.Once I spent 10-15 minutes configuring the image settings (essentially getting rid of the power save mode on every setting), I was able to create a crisp, realistic and beautiful image - Incredibly solid.The sound is not the best, but it is also not the worst.

The tv supported the 1080p without a problem. While starting I saw 1080p/60hz, then once the movie was playing I saw 1080p/24hz I think it's how that was spelled. The streaming programs also looked great on the tv. So far I'm warming up to the tv. FYI, fry's has a 50 inch tv for like four hundred in case any one is looking.Update August 16, 2012I found that you can skip the channels you don't want on this tv tuner. This feature is found under Menu/Channel/Channel Settings. Here you will find small boxes, one says skip, the other favorites. This is where you add a check mark for channels you don't want to view and this is also where you'll find the check mark on the channels you have added to your favorites. Now the tv is more enjoyable as I don't need to scroll through channels I don't care for.Pros:-Built-in tuner. I'm glad to get rid of my separate box.-Okay size, I now know I can fit a slightly bigger tv where my old one was, darn. Even 40\" still doesn't look that big, but I am loving the new size.-I love the side placement of the connections and buttons. Makes it easier to connect other audio/video components. You have to use small/thinner cables though or they will show on the side. Farther in would work best, but I still prefer this to having them on the bottom.-I thought I give sceptre a try since they are about an hour from me. My old no name brand lcd tv has been working fine all these years, but I wanted to get hdmi and 1080p.-Remote control is comfortable, a bit long but buttons are a good size, well at least the numbers arrows, and volume keys.-HDMI seems to work fine with my htpc. I now have the computer video and sound coming from the hdmi port. This got rid of two cables I had on my old setup.-Sound is okay, but I use separate speakers.-UPS couldn't find the house, but when they did, the box was fine, it was shipped in the original box, so I was expecting this to have a hole through, but nothing but a small tear on one side, so I'm glad.-The egg had it for 279 which is not a bad deal for this size, but I had to pay for tax so it was just over this 300. Other 32 sizes are going for more than this, so it was a no brainer to try this one. Unfortunately for me I had to pay for tax, but shipping was free so that helped a bit.-It's working!-It's surprisingly light compared to my smaller older LCD TV.Cons or just things I have found about this tv:-No picture in picture for a relatively new tv which I just noticed, this sucks. My 7 year old tv had it and it doesn't even have a tuner.-Many over the air HD channels are coming in as 1080i (Interlaced) not 1080p. I'm in Los Angeles and just use a regular antenna, no cable or dish. These still look fine, but depending on the program you can still see grainy or slight snow which can get annoying at times. This does seem to be more program dependent and more noticeable on lower HD programs, but still noticeable. After playing around with the settings, many do look better, but it's not perfect. A bit of wash (a bit too bright) too so I'm still trying to decide if I can live with it. I have yet to see anything in 1080P. I have turned off the dynamic setting, but still see some things a bit too white which sort of washes out if other stuff on the screen is light color.-Can't seem to delete channels I don't want, like my old separate tuner box. There is a favorites add/delete button so I guess I have to use this which I think sucks.-Remote buttons DON't light up which really stinks for a newer tv. A glow in the dark remote would work too.-Sceptre logo before tv starts, really annoying, it's a TV, we don't need logos on the screen when you turn it on, there's one on the front of the tv, we know what it is. Seriously?-The wall mount only has four screw holes. My old one had two sets which were closer and allowed me to mount my htpc, this one doesn't so I have to rig something up in order to mount that pc on the back of the tv. I used the base mount not a wall mount.-Blue LED on the front left corner is annoying since it stays on when the tv is on, turns red when off. I hate blue LEDs and this one is no exception. It's distracting to me but at least its smaller than others I have seen. I rather see a softer color, but nothing at all is better when the tv is on and even off.-1920x1080 on the htpc with windows 7 pro can only fit perfectly on the screen with the tv screen setting set at \"Full 100%\" and there is no setting to move the LCD left, right, up, or down like on a regular lcd monitor which is fine as I was able to use this setting. Unfortunately the screen seems a bit funny like when your video card settings are not set correctly. It's perfectly viewable, but when I go to an even lower setting the icon colors look much better, but the screen looks a bit fuzzy so I just use the setting above.-No internet applications or connection, so you can't update anything on it, period. What you get is what you get, nothing more, nothing less.I will update later on as time goes on to see how well this tv holds up. The X408BV/X409BV seem to be the exact same tv. I printed out both specifications and couldn't find any difference between the two. I ordered what the description said was the x408, but received the x409. There's no model number on the box, you'll see it when you take the tv out. At lest this is what the yellow sticker had. I'll have to check the back again to see which one it is.

I wasn't expecting too much as this is a very inexpensive TV, but its of a quality far beyond its price. I also bought a Tritton 720+ headset with this for use with my Xbox and PC to add surround sound, the coaxial audio out on the TV helped a ton! I just bought a Coaxial to optical converter, and Viola! Works great.  Only negatives i can see are that the stand is pretty flimsy, but the TV itself is incredibly light so its not a big issue, but its also easily wall mountable so that would solve that problem. And also, the screen is VERY thin. The slightest touch will disperse the screen for about 30 seconds, very unusual.

It has 3 HDMI ports which is useful considering I have a PS3, sometimes like to attach my laptop and have other HD items connected to the TV.

It does have its drawbacks, but then what product doesn't?Many others have complained about the audio quality.  To me it's a TV, not an expensive sound system.  For everyday viewing, sports, news, etc. the sound is okay. The level needed to hear the TV is a bit higher than I was used to, but I get by.  For viewing streaming I just run it through my home entertainment center. Picture quality is middle of the road.  The Toshiba LCD that this replaced had a sharper picture but it was considerably smaller in size.  Also the screen aspect ratio choices are less than with the Toshiba.  Not an issue with me really, but it might be with other users.On the down side the connection plug ins, HDMI and Component are on the side.

No it does not have all the bells and whistles of a Samsung Smart Tv or a Sony Bravia and the picture is not quite as good but it also is way less money.  The picture is really nice to me the only thing is the blacks are not always deep enough in low light scences they are fine for brighter scences. I think what I am trying to say is in night time scenes there could be a little better contrast between dark colors but it is not a big deal. The tv lacks the ARC (audio return channel) feature that makes it easier to use your audio video receiver with your tv. I have a lot more HDMI ports on my receiver so I could connect more accessories easier.  You have to use a digital coaxial cable to get digital sound with your A/V receiver.  I have heard that ARC is better I don't know I haven't heard it but the sound using the digital coaxial cable is really good and definitely better than what you get with RCA or analog cables.  You have three HDMI ports on the tv and you can connect your laptop or a USB device to the set it works nicely. It is better with external speakers the speakers on the tv are only ok.  If you are watching a movie with special effects or a lot of action you will be much happier using external speakers or a receiver.Don't be afraid to try this tv because you have not heard of Sceptre.

Shortly after getting the tv, I purchased (on Amazon) a $60 set of 2:1 Cyber Acoustics speakers.  Great set up. Technically they are computer speakers, but again I trusted my Amazon reviews and they've been working great with the tv.  I use a ROKU with an HDMI cable for Netflix etc. I have the lowest quality ROKU but the quality is great on the tv.  I don't have a blue-ray so I actually find myself drawn to streaming Netflix through the HDMI vs. popping in a DVD through the A/V setup.  I'm not a super picky person about tv.  This is the largest and nicest tv I've ever had in my house. I do feel like I'm pretty easy to please but I immediately felt like all the positive reviews were confirmed when I pulled it out of the box and powered it on.  I think anything that would have given this tv 4 stars was overshadowed by the price.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for the budget conscious", "Author": "4 season commuter", "ReviewID": "R2HWR2HBDZI4Q6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is there tv's out there with a better picture quality and features....probably....but at this price?....no chance.  We have had a glass tube tv for almost 15 years and only decided to get a new one since the screen was really starting to dim and loose color.  We are not hard core tv or movie watchers probably <10 hours a week.  So when we wanted to get a new tv we wanted something that would offer good picture quality at an affordable price.  The audio is not the greatest but for everyday tv watching it is just fine, and the unti has an audio out allowing it to be connected to external sound.  For movies we route all the sound to a receiver and it works just fine.  The only thing we have found that is kind of annoying is the remote sensitivity.  You have to be right in front of the tv at a close range for it to respond.....but don't let this sway you from the purchase if you want good picture quality at a affordable price.  With HD programming the picture is crystal clear.  For a budget unit I don't feel like we were delivered budget features and quality, it meets all my expectations and more especially at the price.

The stereo sound function works, albeit the sound system, like many thin screen, t.v.s, leaves much to be desired; it's over-powered by high-frequency noises and results in a sound floor of shreaky, tinny, noise-rattling harshness.  This is not different from other brands of thin-screen televisions.  Consequently, a Boston Accoustics sound bar and sub-woofer from Amazon were subsquently added, and that completed the picture, so to speak.  This monitor is watched from a typical distance of 10 -12 feet, and it's nice to be able to read the fine print in the sports \"time remaining and score bar\" at the bottom of the screen.

However out of all the TV deals I found this one was the only one which really stood out to me. The price point for this TV is really good for it's size.I managed to get this TV + wall mount (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WYVBR0/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_SC_dp_1) + shipping + tax for just barely under $300! Not to shabby Amazon I can't complain, Black Friday Rules!This TV gets 4/5 stars for the value. But I cannot go with 5/5 because it seems that the picture quality could be a little better. It seems to me that this TV gets a little bit blurry when adjusting it's images (things moving on screen). I don't know if its a slow refresh rate or the pixel/screen quality is just not as good as it could be. However it is not very bad, some people might not even notice. It could just be that I am so used to my very nice LG monitor, and bigger screens always seem to lose some visual crispness/quality with the fine details.I think it sounds OK for a bedroom on low-mid volume settings (while watching TV). But when trying to play video games it becomes VERY apparent that these speakers do not have a good dynamic range. If you want to listen loud or do anything with crazy sound effects you will want a speaker system for this. Although I have only had the TV a few days it is possible the speakers might break in a little bit and sound better for gaming (kinda doubt it).If you want bang for your buck get this TV!

At $259, this 39\" TV is a terrific value.  Setup was easy.  It even came with a small Phillips screwdriver to attach the base.  (By the way, a couple of reviewers commented that their Sceptre TVs fell forward off their table.  I believe they may have attached the base backwards, with the wider part of the base incorrectly facing the rear of the TV.  The set is very stable when the wider part of the base faces front per the assembly instructions.)Mom previously had an analog TV that required a small cable converter to convert the digital signal for her 20 basic cable channels to analog.  We eliminated this converter, and in about 10 minutes, the Sceptre's clear QAM tuner found 40 digital cable channels.  Many of these extra channels were of no interest to my mother and we were able to easily \"skip\" these from the channel scan.  Picture quality is very good.  The remote is logically laid out, but the buttons and labels are a bit small for many older-persons' eyes.The sound was very tinny at first but after adjusting the equalizer settings under a \"user\" profile, we were able to add some bass and reduce some of the treble.

There is no tilt, but it swivels easily. (A screwdriver is supplied.)I've read most of the reviews of this TV. Most agree the built-in sound is not great, and they are absolutely correct in my opinion. Not a consideration for me since I feed the audio signal from the cable box hdmi jack to an AV Receiver. The TV's speakers are weak and a little shrill, however I believe most people will probably use a sound bar or a receiver to process the sound. In addition to the speakers, the TV has a digital sound output jack for a dedicated sound bar. (Keep in mind that the hdmi jack also carries the digital sound.) Also, there is a head-set jack that produces excellent sound in my Panasonic hi-fi stereo head-set.Additionally, the remote is clearly labeled and easy to use, and the initial set-up is clearly described. The instructions note that two people should assemble it, but I'm a skinny old man, and I was able to do it without help.Now as to the picture quality, it is very good. Not excellent, because I couldn't get a setting that would lower the contrast to see detailed dark portions of images, without dimming the picture. But, considering the very low price of the TV, I gave it five stars, relative to it's crystal clear picture, and vivid colors. Most of the low-price 39 or 40-inch TVs are priced around a hundred dollars or more higher, with negligent increase in picture quality. For that difference in price, a sound-bar with sub-woofer, would provide superior sound to any of the more expensive TVs in this class.

First, though I would like to preface my comments with the fact that this is the first flatscreen television I have ever owned in my 24 years of life having only used old box tvs from the 90s. Now with that out of the way lets review the product.I was a bit hesitant to buy this television as I had never heard of the manufacturer. However, after some research I found that some of Wal-Mart's best selling tvs were this brand (take that as you will). I had read some of the reviews here about picture quality as well as audio quality not being stellar but decided that for, at the time $230 w/free shipping, it was worth the potential risk. Firstly I have to say, that coming from a standard old 27 inch Magnavox set, the picture is superb. This is especially true after doing some basic calibration, search google for AVS HD 709, the picture is in my opinion at least an 8 out of 10. I dropped two points only because on the extreme viewing angles on the edge the picture seems to degrade but this seems to be a problem with some flatscreen sets. I mainly use this tv for gaming (Xbox 360, PS2, GameCube) and streaming content (Netflix, Crunchyroll, HuluPlus, YouTube) and I am happy with the results. The specs on the tv say that the refresh rate is 6.5ms which I have only noticed affecting gameplay when I am extremely focused with what is happening on the screen (FPS, Fighting, Racing). As for audio quality I use this tv set in my room, which is about the size of your average american university dorm, and it can get quite loud. I rarely turn it up above 30. Now lets break everything down.Pros-Picture Quality (after some calibration)-Audio Quality (after some setting changes)-Form factor (takes up way less space than my old set)-Inputs (3 HDMI, Component, Composite, PC)-1080pCons-Needs some fiddling with (Out of box settings should be changed to get best quality)-Power Saving mode (when you change settings power savings mode is removed)-AVL (auto volume level sometimes makes content too low or too loud, can be turned off)I would greatly recommend this television set to anyone.P.S. Here are my personal Video and Audio settingsVideo-Brightness 46-Contrast 74-Color 44-Tint 0-Sharpness 35-Screen Size Full 100%-Color Temperature Normal-Advanced Picture Settings all offSound-Bass, Treble, Balance all set to 0-Surround Mode off-AVL off-Speaker on-Digital Audio Output PCM-Equalizer off", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Budget Brand That Won't Break In 2 Years", "Author": "Luke K.", "ReviewID": "R33LYXAMHQV838", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to start off by saying that I DO NOT own this TV, but before you stop reading, know this.

I spent a modest $350 for my TV, which at the time was a very good deal. Apart from single stalled pixel right out of the box, my Sceptre TV ran like a champ and is STILL working just fine.  That's right, 5 years later my Sceptre TV is still running great, no dead pixels, no loss in sound, the worst thing that has happened is all the numbers rubbed off the remote, big deal.Bottom line, if you're in the market for a new TV, but don't want to break the bank, or have a new TV die on you in 2-3 years, this is the brand to go with.

The sound can be adjusted quite a bit with  the bass and treble AND equalizer controls.  It sounds fine to us.Easy to set up with plenty of input/outputs.  We are about 40 miles from Dallas and get several channels on rabbit ears. We use the TV for streaming video (Amazon, Netflix, etc.) via a $50 Roku HD and seldom watch broadcast except for news and PBS which come in fine...most of the time.I would definitely recommend this TV.

Ours was for use in a bedroom so it gets only light use and that was why I was also willing to take a chance with an off brand. I had first purchased a 32\" TV at SAM's but then discovered this 40\" Sceptre on Amazon for about a net $20 difference. Bigger is always better when it comes to TV size. The Sceptre is not a \"Smart\" TV but I don't see that as much of a deterrent. I feel that issue is better handled by the use of a Roku or other more complete separate device than built in features that don't handle input from all providers. The features on the Sceptre are pretty extensive with multiple HDMI ports and a lot of controls on the Remote. Overall I will say that it feels like it is perhaps not quite as \"refined\" as the Samsungs that I have but then it also sells for a much more attractive price for the size. The only thing I truly find to be slightly annoying with this TV is that for some reason they felt the need to momentarily show the name \"Sceptre\" on the screen every time the unit is first turned on. Why anyone at the company didn't perceive that the repetitive nature of this would not be annoyng is puzzling but it is not a major issue. As long as this TV works problem free over time I will be happy. Complaints about sound or picture quality are very user expectation dependent. I found I did need to play with the settings to find levels that I found acceptable but I certainly was able to adjust it to something I found reasonable. It is very difficult if nearly impossible for a TV to be as flat as an LED and still contain speakers that can deliver great sound. If you are very particular then you will likely need to add a soundbar.

It was to replace a 36\" Honeywell bought from a shopping network (I know - never again)4 years ago which works great - I just wanted a larger tv.  Duh...I should have done a LOT more research than just read reviews.For one thing, this tv is smaller than the 36\" in overall appearance.  I just didn't like it on the wall and couldn't get used to the smaller size and then I realized I did have a larger picture screen with the 36\".  I changed the Aspect from Zoom to Cinema to Standard on the Sceptre and did not like any of them - not for what I wanted.So, down it came and back up went the Honeywell.The Sceptre tv itself is a nice looking tv.  The sound is a bit off, but since I am not doing anything with it other than watching movies/primetime it is okay.  I am having to get used to it and am still wishing I had gotten a larger screen.  Now all that is just me.  For the price, I think it is a great purchase.  The picture is clear. There is really nothing to dislike about it.  A remote with a light would have been nice though.I also bought a Haier L32A2120 32-Inch 720p 60Hz LCD HDTV for the bedroom and prefer the look/picture/sound to that of the Sceptre.I think my review would be to point out to not just buy something based on what you think you are reading rather than to sit down and pay attention to exactly 'what' you are reading and do comparisons which I did not.

The reviews were a mixed bag with most being positive actually, you can't always trust everything negative you read, sometimes you just have to pull the trigger and not look back. I have to say, I'm glad I did. The display, like most others will point out. Is just incredible for a TV of this price. The speakers are lousy but thankfully there is a Audio In on the side of the TV which allowed me to hook up my computer speakers with subwoofer for a huge improvement. The stand is somewhat wobbly but not enough to where you fear the TV falling forward or backward just fasten it tight. The width of the TV I would say is midsized, though far from being the thinnest LCD on the market but definitely not the thickest either. Games look gorgeous on my PS3. I just bought this set so it's durability and longevity is still to be determined but if you're looking for a budget LCD that will give you a huge bang for your buck then look no further than the Sceptre 40 class.PROS :Awesome picture quality for it's class.Affordable.Comes with it's own microfiber cloth and screwdriver.

I have multiple things hooked up to this TV, including both of my laptops, Wii, PS3, speakers, Digital Antenna. There is soo much to choose from I rarely use it as a conventional television. It just has inputs for everything. I feel like I need a dedicated smart blue ray player at this point to truely appreciate visual quality. I watched Avatar on my PS3 hooked up on HDMI and although it was incredible and a great first look at your new unit I know it can do more. I checked the unit's speaker quality again to see if I felt the same about them as initially and I concur with my original review, they don't have any bite to them... It's not enough of a gripe to lower it from 5 stars. We are talking about 39\" of beautiful display at a very affordable cost. With those things in mind the incredible amount of inputs from VGA, to 3xHDMI to Audio in analog, to audio out plus more you have almost everything you need. What more can you ask for at such prices? Probably a DVI input.*Update May 28, 2013*This may be my final update unless something goes tragically wrong in the future. I have no buyer's remorse at this time.

First, realizing that Tv's are quickly becoming throw away items, we did not want to invest in any high cost items.  We determined we did not care about the name on the set and we were going to look at cost first and then do all of the investigation we could via reviews on Amazon as well as other sites.  We ended up focusing on this set primarily cause it would fit in our existing armoire.  Most reviews reflected a great picture but terrible sound.  We did not care about sound as we have surround.  Some folks talked about inferior plastic construction, all tv's that I see are plastic. Some talked about how wobbly the stand is but since this was going in a cabinet we did not concern ourselves with it.The television arrived in 2 days via prime.  I already had the old set removed and my home theater ready to hook up.  Set up was easy and quick as we had it turned on within 30-40 minutes.  Part of set-up now days is getting a universal remote to work and many of the reviews had difficulty finding Sceptre remote codes.  Right in the manual that comes with a Tv it stated to use Sony codes.  In fact my old tv was a sony and my satellite remote worked on this set immediately as the code is what I had previously.The picture is very good, better than the Sony that we had. It was pretty close right out of the box but I have ultimately changed the settings to my own liking.  We can't tell you anything about the sound as we immediately turned it off to use our own sound system.  I don't like the sound of any tv with stand alone sound. Watched nfl footbal first evening and there were no issues with motion at all.  One thing I would like to pass on is it is really wobbly. When pushing the cabinet back to the wall it wobbled all over.  There is a screw hole in the back of the base where you can fasten it down to keep it from tipping over if you like.  The reason it is not stiff is because of the swivel ability, they might consider doing away with that feature.  One other tip for you is to turn the sharpness setting up fairly high.  We also have a larger Hitachi in our home that I love but had to turn sharpness up on that as well.Hope this information is useful to those of you that are doing what we just ended doing in investigating a purchase.

In contrast my Toshiba in the living room cost 3 times more and the sound stinks. we have basic cable in the bedroom and the picture is fine to my eyes. Just a little tweaking in picture settings was necessary. HD is probably wonderful. The remote needs to be replaced with a universal that has learning function. the remote follows Sony codes but the select button will not work unless learned from the original remote.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "The picture is great!", "Author": "Jackie Newton", "ReviewID": "R33E0Q6C3G2ACD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This has a beautiful picture, I agree with other reviews that the sound isn't the best but for the price it's acceptable", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great T.V", "Author": "kelvin gauthier", "ReviewID": "R3ETXXCSE9I9RY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This T.V is great for Small to Mid Size rooms.

Honestly I have already gotten used to the sound but if you are concerned about sound might consider a sound bar. Trick is to turn off stereo setting wich helps a fair amount.

After reading all the good reviews on both Amazon and Newegg, I decided I would take a chance on this TV. After all, you can't beat $259 for an 40 inch HDTV. It sounded like a good replacement for our old TV and at an amazing price. Well... sometimes good reviews aren't everything.When I got the TV I was surprised by how much smaller it was compared to our old one. It's not a 40 inch at all. It's more like 36\"-38\" (I think the box says 38.5\"), depending on how you measure it, which isn't all that much bigger than our bedroom TVs. That wasn't enough to completely turn me off to it, but it was a start.The TV is easy enough to set up. We didn't have any trouble getting it on the stand. It even comes with its own screwdriver to put in the screws. We stuck it on the stand and got it plugged in, turned it on and... nothing. The red light turned over to blue but no picture. I was like, okay, what's wrong with it? We looked in the manual, and it states it may take 10-12 seconds to properly turn on. We waited well past 10-12 seconds. It was more like 4 minutes, maybe even 5. I'm not entirely sure. But it was to the point where I was thinking it was broken. I went from the living room to my computer in the bedroom, deciding to google it and see if anyone else experienced this, when I was told it FINALLY came on. Obviously this didn't look like a good sign. Why did it take THAT long to turn on?We got it set up with our HD DirecTV box easy enough. The picture was not great out of the box but with some adjusting we got it to look decently. However programming the remote was a fail. I managed to get the right code put in, but the DirecTV remote won't adjust the volume unless you hit mute first. It turns the TV on and off without problems, but forget working the volume with it. I also couldn't get the input to work, either. Despite it being something small, this was just another thing that bothered me.I just could not bring myself to like this TV. Maybe I'm just being picky but it wasn't at all what I expected it to be. I also worried that maybe something may go wrong later if it had that much trouble first turning on. Just didn't take that as a good sign. I will say the picture is pretty decent. Maybe not the best picture I've seen, but not bad. And unlike most people, I wasn't bothered by the sound. Then again, I've reviewed another TV where everyone said the sound was horrible, and I wasn't bothered then either. Maybe it's because I have a small home or maybe I just don't care that much about perfect sound. Either way, it's not bad. The TV can get pretty loud if you turn it all the way up, and I didn't hear any scratchiness or static when I had it turned up. Oh, and the one thing I DID like about this TV was the fact that it's on a swivel. You can turn it to the right or the left with ease, which is nice depending on your living room setup. It's also extremely light. One person could carry it on their own (though I wouldn't recommend that). It's not heavy it all. It isn't exactly a thin TV, though. It's a little on the bulky side. Maybe because it has so many inputs. The on/off buttons are also on the side.Overall, I'm not going to say this TV is an absolute piece of crap. For the price, I guess it's not too bad. But don't buy it expecting a high quality TV for a cheap price. It's a mediocre TV at best.

The TV was well protected on the corners and had a piece of Styrofoam on the top and bottom, but the sides of the box were relatively unprotected. I probably really wouldn't have noticed this but when I received the TV there were some dents and rips in the exterior cardboard box (I suppose just damage received in transit?). I was a little worried some of these might have gone through, however, thankfully the TV was unscratched on the inside.On the whole, for the $260 I paid for this, it seems like an amazing deal.

I will tell you this, mounting the TV to the wall will improve the sound greatly.  Again, you aren't going to get the sound of a Home theater system or a Bose system, but what do you expect for this price range?  With the TV mounted to my wall, I can hear it on a volume level setting of 10 (very low amount) 3 rooms away.  It provides plenty of sound and you will not have to crank it up to hear it.I can not talk about the longevity of this TV since I just got it, but if you are on the fence, I would say do it.  The picture looks great, more than what I expected for a cheaper TV like this.  (And take my word, I am a TV-phile as I have about 10 TV in my house ranging from projectors, to LED's, to basic LCDs.)

As a prime customer we knew we could get a TV in couple of days.  After a couple of hours of price comparisons and checking out reviews we found that this model TV had the best bang for the buck.  It has a great size plus 1080p HDTV for under $300.00.  I use to own Sceptre computer monitors years ago and never had any issues.  So we ordered this TV.  It arrived from the east coasts in 2 days!  matter of fact it arrived on Christmas eve!  Very nice.  It was easy to  put the stand on the TV.  the quality was pretty good for the price.  No artefacts but the color was rather bland and the blacks are OK. it doesn\u2019t compare to our broken Samsung but that Samsung originally cost 4X as much.  so for the price the Sceptre is a great deal.HE IS OUR BIGGEST ISSUE:  The sound. there is no bass,  it sounds so bad that I thought our TV was broken. After a couple of weeks I caved in and called Amazon tech support who was super helpful.  After troubleshooting they recommended sending out a replacement. The replacement came within 2 days, but it also had no bass in the sound.  So now we are looking to buy a add on sound system for the TV.

I plugged in the Blu-Ray player with HDMI and everything worked like it should.The picture is really good.

The Wii looks great. Streaming Netflix looks pixelated but that's due to slow internet, not picture quality.  I've not played a Blu-Ray movie on it yet, though.The loss of one star is because of the audio.  It's plenty loud and the quality is sufficient, but the speakers are small and it doesn't take much bass to rattle them out at the bottom.  If you choose external audio, then this becomes a non-issue.I bought mounting hardware at the same time and it mounted up just fine.  It has a flat back which makes mounting a snap.

Another MAJOR disapointment, called Sceptre for any advice they might have... could only leave message for them. It is now 24 hours later, and no return call. So be it, I have already boxed it up, pushed the return/replacement on Amazon, and will write a more product oriented review if the replacement unit arrives in full working order.Two days later and Amazon scores high with a fast replacement! Previous problem obviously not operator error as this unit works just fine. Good sound but do not expect it to sound like a full system, it's just a TV! If you want great sound, add an AV system with Subwoofer. Tuner setup finds all the digital and analog channels available on my standard TW cable just fine. HD channels give a superior picture and the analog channel picture is good but not great, as is to be expected with the screen size. DVD via HDMI input is excellent from an up-scaling player.

Since I saw this for sale on Black Friday week for under $270 shipped, I decided to take the plunge.  One of the most important things I want to stress about this monitor is its size.  Here are the official specs straight from Sceptre36.5\"(W) x 25.2 \"(H) x 11.1 \"(D) (With Stand)36.5\"(W) x 22.8 \"(H) x 4.5 \"(D) (Without Stand)26.01 lbs (With Stand)For a 40\" television that is exactly 36.5 inches, it was a blessing for me who had limited space to work with.  Most folks who have old fashioned television cabinets will find it still fits inside the main frame, so that's a plus if you're one of those.Since I don't have a huge background in reviewing electronics or the tools to make accurate measurements; I'll just briefly describe the quality of the picture and the color rendition in simple terms.The quality of the picture at its native resolution (1920x1080 60hz) looks just fine.  I've had no issues with motion blur / lag with the few games I've played on it.  The main thing I want to point out is the color reproduction, which feels over-saturated.  As much as I tried to fiddle around with the presets built into the monitor as well as manually adjusting the sliders to an appropriate level; there's nothing I could do to make blacks look dark.  Most blacks look bluish/gray, and this may turn off a lot of folks who will be using this as a television mainly for movies.  I also want to note that the white presets are bluish on \"Cool\" and \"Normal\".  I actually found \"Warm\" to be what most televisions consider \"Normal\" in terms of color temperature.I would recommend this television primarily for its size first and quality second.  It's a heck of a lot better than most budget televisions out there on the market, and I think as long as you keep your expectations in check for the price you paid for this unit you'll be happy with it.

The seller of the mount assured me that it would fit, that he had gone to the manufacturers site and that it is indeed 200 x 200 Versa. I took pictures of the back of the TV, sent them to the seller of the mount and he was shocked. It is not 200 x 200. Now he is welling to do whatever to make me happy. Is even sending some adapters to make the mount fit. He's a least trying. Amazon on the other isn't and hasn't. They advertize something that is clearly wrong, cost me a lot of time, has cost the seller of the mount extra time and money, but won't even answer my emails. Amazon screwed up on this and won't do anything to address it. Nothing, Zip, Nadda. So buy the TV if you want to but be forwarned it is NOT standard Versa 200x200 if you intend to wall mount it.

This set is actually the second set I am trying because I originally ordered a LG set that did not work for a full month. I returned that set and chose the Sceptre televsion. I am totally hoping this one lasts for a long time. After reading some of the reviews I am getting skeptical and trying to decide if I should return it. Due to my experience with the LG I will definitely return it at the first signs of any problem. If I could do this over I think I would throw in a little more money and get a well known reliable brand of TV.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far, so good!", "Author": "Cyndi", "ReviewID": "RH3ILNIOXXAD7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So we haven't hooked it up yet, but will after Christmas.

The sound quality, as others have mentioned, is very poor. It has an extremely tinny quality which makes it very hard to hear dialogue without turning the volume way up, but considering the price that's something you can probably live with.However after a few months I came home from work to find the TV lying on the floor with the screen cracked. I'm still not 100% sure what happened, but it looks like the TV toppled over and the stand was a little too small for the size of the TV. We can see no other reason why the TV would have fallen. If you do purchase this item, I strongly urge you to find some way to weigh the stand down. Although really I would urge you to pay out a few bucks more and get a better TV, honestly it's worth the investment.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unhappy", "Author": "Zenny", "ReviewID": "R2494NZTS1UHIV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Excited to receive the unit but when it arrived the corner of the screen looked like it w as crunched and since it was a used product I don't think anyone inspected it before reselling, box was not damaged at Amazon.I purchased a 93\" TV at Amazon and was very happy with it.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unreliable", "Author": "Brandy", "ReviewID": "R35H9WKJ8D7R9P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've owned three sceptre monitors and they all failed in less than five years.
