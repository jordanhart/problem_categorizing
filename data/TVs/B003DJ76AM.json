Internet apps", "Author": "John Scott", "ReviewID": "R1K0USBVGRI00E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this TV for one day but it has been marvelous so far.  I wasn't really in the market for a 3D set but I bought this for the great 2D picture.  I think it may be the first 480hz refresh rate set out - at least at this screen size. It is amazingly thin and compact for a 47\" screen. Set up involves attaching the included table-top stand - 8 screws total.  I had no problems in setting up for HDMI inputs.  I do not use the built in speaker since I'm running it through a home theater receiver.  But before I set up the external audio, I thought the speaker sounded sounded serviceable during set up (about average for flat panel TVs).  I do not use any other inputs besides HDMI.  SD channels look good while HD channels are quite good.  LED achieves excellent black levels.  I hooked it up to my router via ethernet cable and it self-updated the firmware immediately. I was able to link to my Netflix account for streaming movies very quickly and play around with widgets -- I like yahoo weather & stocks.  Other built in apps include You Tube, and a couple of pay-per-fee streaming video services that look attractive - at least of of them offers rentals cheaper than my sat provider or X-box Live account. I have not purchased 3D glasses (yet) as I don't have any content (yet).  I'll update on that when I pull the trigger on 3D.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV but...", "Author": "yapchagi", "ReviewID": "R3T1AMZVSOEYEM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The good: Picture quality is really good. Better than my 47LG50 2008 model.The bad: Tried to connect my PC via HDMI (GTX 480 mini HDMI to HDMI). PC is using Windows 7 and it won't detect HDCP.Mouse movement is delayed.Also, when connected to XBOX 360 via HDMI with Dolby Digital on, TV won't output Dolby Digital sound via Optical output. My hometheater can't detect any DD signal at all.Even my old 47LG50 can output Dolby Digital sound via Optical output for XBOX 360.Speaker sound is horrible. It sounds like the speaker is breaking. My old 47LG50 sounds better.Haven't tried connecting PC via VGA yet. But VGA is worse than HDMI no matter what. Why bothers.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding HD picture", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R2BJV6ZKFNYJA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a high-def flat panel TV without giving up two key advantages of a good tube TV - picture brightness and freedom from motion blur.  This set easily fills that bill as the picture with from either HD Directv or Blu-ray is outstanding. I don't care about 3D but I read that the demanding technology required for 3D sets yields superior 2D performance. That is definitely the case here as I am amazed at the picture quality. I haven't tried the high end features such as Internet widgets but at least I know that they are there if I want them. The unit's sleek design  is another plus - especially the minimal border and non-existent bezel. Great unit.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Full LED 3D TV 480Hz Great Pics, connected internet very liked", "Author": "Joch \"Jon\"", "ReviewID": "R2CIV7VSX3DS0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Pics qualities with 3D, so many ways adjust pics & audio qualities, it is great for watch sports & games.only thing audio is not very good, and need to be improved.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing purchase", "Author": "Nathaniel", "ReviewID": "R1YGJGO854LMV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This LED display has been amazing and I am proud to say I own it! The item itself is mainly developed for video display, one minor issue is the single speaker on the rear of the TV it provides limited sound. I have a surround sound system so no problem there.

I jumped all over it as competition pricing from other brands was 2-3k, and online, I couldn't find this unit cheaper than $1850.  Not sure why they were closing it out, but the picture is AMAZING, and the wireless functionality works great.  Like all flat panel screens, the speaker volume leaves something to be desired. I love the fact that with the wifi adapter connected, it \"updates\" my tv system software automatically.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "excellent TV", "Author": "C. Ahuja \"CA\"", "ReviewID": "RR8X809VB7ZJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought LG8500 at $1199 from frys. Within two week they offered LX9500 at same price. I jumped on the opportunity and upgraded. I didn't change for 3D or 480Hz. This one has better sound and built-in subwoofer. Another advanted is that it is 20lbs lighter than LE8500. I have no complaint about LE8500, that was an excellent TV, had great picture. Only problem I have seen with LX9500 is that they have supplied a rear stand cover and there is no way to install it. It seems that it has a design flaw and no body tested the assembly. I checked with frys and they said, yes they have heard the complaint and since most people mount it on wall, very few people have noticed it.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Wireless 1080p Ready with USB adapter\nTruMotion 480Hz\nNetCast Entertainment Access: Netflix, Roxio CinemaNow, Yahoo Widgets, Vudu, and Pandora\nTHX certified display", "Name": "LG 47LX9500 47-inch 1080p 480Hz 3D Ready LED-Backlit HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ddDTC7ZeL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003DJ76AM"}}
