First said, The  picture quality is outstanding, and can be tweaked to an infinite level with all the in depth menu settings. The speakers are on the bottom and fire downward.  I find the sound to be very good on all inputs EXCEPT for TV where you are pulling your signal thru a coax cable.  For whatever reason sound level is way down on that input.  But on HDMI, component, etc sound level is strong and actually sounds pretty good. But to note, this weak sound on the TV input seems to be the norm, as I have noticed that effect on my other non Sharp flat screen TVs as well. I have my Sharp TV sitting in an entertainment center, so that serves as an amplifing box and pushes the sounds out in a good strong level. One GREAT thing about this (and most Sharp TVs) is that they have the RCA audio output jacks that can be connected to the older style receivers that do not have the optical input.I just plug my red/white audio cable jacks from the TV to  the matching input jacks on my receiver and like magic, there is great sound being delivered through my stereo system.  You don't even have to turn the TV's speakers off, as the output jacks carry the signal along with the TV's internal speakers.  You can turn the TV speaker volume down to zero without effecting the stereo's sound level, or you can turn the TV's speaker volume up slightly and get a really cool surround type effect.All in all I love this TV and it's quality features. Sharp is one of the leading LCD screen manufacturers in the world, and they usually lead the industry in quality and innovation (Such as the Sharp Quattron screen with the extra \"yellow\" pixel.)Sharp has always made great electronics.  I currenty have a 30 year old Sharp 13\" TV (with remote control) set up in our kitchen and it still performs as well today as it did 30 years ago when it was new.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great 1st HD TV", "Author": "Blue Eyed Love Goddess \"BELGM\"", "ReviewID": "R3NUP0M6WDBIHB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for our 1st HD tv, for our living room.  It is of course not as good as a $1,000 TV but I could not afford that price.  I was concerned with the speaker issue several people discussed on thier reviews...BUT there is NO issue....the sound is great and I usually only have it at about 15.  No need for a bigger speaker.  ALSO someone complained it did not come wiht a manual...but it does, and even if they did not have one you can get it online to download.  Additionally, I was a little confused in the set-up but that was due to the cable box not the tv. All in all...we love this tv for the price.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sharp AQUOS LC40D78UN", "Author": "Daniel E Kelley", "ReviewID": "R2LAT0OR44RZH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this television about a month ago and so far we're very happy with its picture and performance.  We did pay considerably less buying it locally (just under $600).Unlike another comment, I had no problem with the remote control, though since adding a satellite receiver to the television, I find myself rarely using the TV remote. The HD picture is just fantastic and even SD television is a far improvement over our previous CRT SD television.My only criticism of the unit is the sound, which appears to be directed toward the rear of the unit.  As we've got it sitting in an enclosed cabinet, it took a little getting used to, but is no longer an issue.For the price we paid, this was an excellent buy.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV!", "Author": "Kentkatchem", "ReviewID": "R1GMSFZ2YFQMRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV about 3 weeks ago, and I have to say I just LOVE IT!!!  I couldn't be happier w/the choice I made. I had a Sharp Aquos before, a 32 inch that just started giving out. I guess they don't last forever, but other than that I've really enjoyed my experience w/Sharp. I bought this Sharp for 499.99 (which to me was a steal for a 40in) but I also got FREE 2 day delivery! I was just amazed that I was able to buy this Wednesday afternoon, & have it in my room & hooked up by Friday night. Awsome!!!! The picture looks great, I love all the HDMI ports it has to offer... & for me, I'm still old school when it comes to a surround sound receiver so I needed the RA jacks, which most new TV's do not offer, but Sharp does! I also have this hooked up to my Xbox360 & my PS3...I just couldn't get over how CLEAR the picture is! It truly is a 1080p, my first one by the way..& it does not dissapoint. About the only thing that I would say is a bit of a negative (small one at that) is the speakers on the TV are facing down. So the sound would be a little muffled if your not used to it..but I use my surround sound anyhow, so no biggie there. I have not tried to hook up my computer to it yet but from what I've heard,that looks amazing too. Just some final thoughts, I just LOVE how this looks in my room..it barely fit in my entertainment center but I got it in..& now it's just like having a personal Movie theater in my room...PS3 looks Fantastic on here..I get on \"Home\" sometimes just to stare at the clarity of the picture..lol..Oh , and watching Blu-Ray movies on here.. Fantastic! I so wish I would've bought this earlier, it's by far my fav. piece of furniture now.. lol. And by the way, Amazon rocks!!!! I normally would've bought  something of this size from Newegg in the past, but after this experience with Amazon, I'm a believer, I will buy all my future merchandise from them. Thanks again Amazon!!!!!", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous TV", "Author": "rbgiantfan", "ReviewID": "R274NCBNR2Z0VP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for about 3 weeks so I figured it was safe to write a review. I have not gotten into the most intricate features of this unit but I have gone through the basics.  First and foremost the picture is outstanding.  It is everything I hoped HDTV would be.  The 120hz scan rate makes the action crystal clear.  I never owned a 60hz so I can't compare it - I'll just say the picture is awesome, with no artifacts, blur, distortion of any kind.  The colors are gorgeous.  I can't imagine a picture being any better than this.  The cabinetry is also very attractive and stylish.  The bezel is quite narrow and the stand is unobtrusive.  I had to fit this TV into an old entertainment armoire that was only 39\" wide.  Many 40\" TV's can't fit, this one can (albeit snugly).The package arrived in NY about one week from order date.  [...], no tax, free shipping for a 40\" 120hz 1080p LCD.  You simply can't find a better deal.  I was concerned that I couldn't find many reviews on this set.  That is why I am taking the time to write this one.  Buy this TV and enjoy it.  I sure am!", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for Console Gaming!!!", "Author": "J. Clapper", "ReviewID": "R1VLYRQVZ9XMBG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently picked up this TV [Sharp AQUOS LC40D78UN] from a fantastic Seller here on Amazon, and couldn't be happier. I had been pulling my hair out over the last few months looking for a TV to play my XBOX360 and PS3 on, looking at reviews it seems the new 240hz 3D tvs are terrible for gaming because of input lag [nothing to do with internet lag] do a little research and you'll see what I mean. Anyways, after looking and looking I came across some reviews and test results showing this TV to have very low lag, an excellent picture quality, and a blazing refresh rate. This TV delivers on all levels. I borrowed some settings from an AV forum and tweaked them a bit till they look great for my room and setup.Some reviewers complain about the sound quality off of the TV speakers, but I could care less about this, as I have everything routed through an awesome SONY receiver.Overall this is a great TV. It replaced a Vizio 32 plasma that was not suited for heavy gaming because of image retention [gets to be annoying quickly]. It has plenty of HDMI inputs for both my consoles and HD Cable. I've watched a couple blu ray movies and they look crystal clear even in fast motion scenes. I am very pleased with black levels, no complaints at all.  Since this set is a full backlit and not an edgelit like most of the new TVs being made now I have noticed no banding, ghosting, or halo effects on anything I've watched yet.Again, I love this TV, and any hardcore gamers out there will too.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sounds hardly there", "Author": "Stock Trader \"Globeseller\"", "ReviewID": "R17S0F0B0CL7UR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this Sharp 3 days ago. The TV is plug in to a coaxial cable via a charter TV.The picture is bright and comparable to a SONY 120 hertz. A Tad cleaner and better but a TAD less color than a SONY. I have both so I did a comparison.The Sharp sound is really a dissapointment. I have the TV at 60 volume level and still the sound is soft.(max is at 60 too) Plug it to a Blue ray player and the sound is still nochalant. Very soft and you could ever hardly hear all the sound and what more if you turn on the surround. I have a very quiet house. I compared it to my Hitachi 40 inch too and the Hitachi volume level is only at 20 and yet its loud. Max volume setting on Hitachi is 50.I short, the picture is great and judder free. Color is superb close to a SONY but more better than a Hitachi. But the sound is less than a SONY and much lesser than a Hitachi.If you plug the RCA output sound to an amplifier then you'll have a much better sound experience.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sharp AQUOS LC40D78UN 40-Inch 1080p LCD TV", "Author": "Rev", "ReviewID": "R37OFTI8C9JEBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased from Luzy's Storage Place.

This tv has a great picture lots of features and i've had no issues or complaints! Best of all my Wife hasn't had any Problems! Happy Wife Happy Life!! No Offense to any wives!! I mean that in a good way. My wife is the one who uses this tv the most and she was really happy that I replaced the old tv with a Bigger one. Plus the picture is much nicer.

This is our first HDTV and we reluctantly replaced our 27\" Sony WEGA CRT because we received this Sharp Aquos as a present.What can I say - HD is the bee's knees and so far, this display has delivered.To my eyes, every display starts to look the same after a certain size, so no input there.This display does have a few quirks, but I believe it's not the fault of the display. Here they are:1. No closed-captioning via HDMI. Again, it's not the fault of the display and probably irrelevant in this review, but we had to enable closed-captioning using our satellite receiver.2. The power-saving options are great, but they'll work even when you don't want them to.

Fortunately, it is used in a dark corner of my bedroom (not my main tv); thus, it is sufficient for years to follow.
