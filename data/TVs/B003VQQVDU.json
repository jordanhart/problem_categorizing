The Netflix support works really well, streamed HD over the wireless without any issues, apparently the same quality as my Roku HD box - that alone is worth buying it for.Some of the widgets are pretty useless (I'm looking at you, CBS), they're basically just ad channels, and I haven't found news that's more than two lines long. It would be nice if there were a web browser for it, or a dedicated NY Times app.The sound quality isn't bad for a TV... you'd get better sound adding some cheap computer speakers with a subwoofer, but I don't really blame the TV, it's so skinny there's not really room for decent speakers.All in all, quite a nice toy, great for a dorm or kitchen.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Internet apps are a game changer.", "Author": "P.

Wireless:  Worked great out-of-the-box. Took maybe a minute for it to connect to my home network, and so far the single strength's been great up to 35' and through at least one wall.  I would feel confident that my 65yo Mom could connect this TV wired or wirelessly.2. Self Update: The tv updated its firmware over the wireless within an hour of being turned on.  The newer firmware did wonders for the web apps as far as speed, app choices, and interfaces for Netflix and Amazon On-demand.3. Video web apps:  Netflix, Amazon On-Demand, Hulu Plus, Pandora, and a couple others are all great.  Picture quality can vary from the supplier, but of the few tests run so far the picture quality of Amazon on-demand, Hulu Plus, and the majority of the netflix videos we looked at were HD quality or nearly indistinguishable from HD.  There's some buffering/blocking at the start of Netflix videos, but disappears after 10-30sec.  Watched a few minutes of Battlestar Galactica HD from Amazon On-Demand and it definitely passed our in-house HD-or-not test with flying colors ('Look good to you?' - 'Yup, looks good to me').  Two thumbs up for AOD.4. Other web-apps:  Meh.  The web apps consist mostly of Yahoo Widget devices, and at this stage I would describe them as basic.  The Facebook app reminds me of my blackberry interface.  This TV does NOT utilize a browser interface, only widget/app interfaces. There are a few game apps, but I haven't tried them yet.  The game selections seem basic, texas holdem, spider solitaire, a few young kids games, nothing too fancy.5. No YouTube app, but there is a Yahoo Videos app.  Not explored.6. Speakers:  3 watt tiny, tin-can'ish speakers.  There is a headphone and optical output on the back of this machine, so there are options w/external speakers, but do not expect much other than getting the job done out of the internal speakers.  For the non-discerning they're fine, but anyone planning to get their rock on need to supply their own.  For me they work great, the kids don't care and they get the job done if I'm using it as a second monitor.7. HDMI connectors - 2 supplied and work great for connecting the PS3 with as few cables as possible.8. Remote:  Kinda clunky, kinda cheap feeling.  I'm a little worried about dropping it from counter height onto a hard surface..  Also, there are limited controls on the TV, everything is manipulated from the remote.  Unfortunately, any text entry is done from a selection grid on screen, moving the cursor, clicking 'ok' on the remote, moving the cursor again, clicking 'ok' on the remote again..  Not so bad a task, but the way the included remote is designed the 'ok' key is buried in the middle of the arrow keys sometimes causing more than one 'ok' entry (which then forces you to arrow-key down to the on-screen delete key and then another 'ok' button-cick.. this remote should have been designed with separate delete & enter keys..)  I'm considering replacing the remote with a universal learning one and putting the oem up for safe-keeping.9. Portability:  Given the built-in wifi, there's really only the power cable to carry with the TV as .long as you're watching online video.10. Connections/Video quality: 2HDMI, 1 Component, 1 Antenna/Cable Connection, 1 composite, 1 RGB.  So far I've tested the HDMI only, connected to an AMD video card and a PS3.  The 1080p is fantastic from both sources, and after fiddling a bit with the TV's video color/brightness settings I'm very pleased with the quality of color and clarity for both monitor and gaming use. I haven't noticed ghosting from either computer games or the PS3.For it's price the unit packs some good bang for the buck - Portable, easy setup/use, better than expected image quality, wifi out-of-the-box, and web-apps (Netflix or Amazon On-Demand alone would have made this an ideal purchase) - with the caveats being the kinda klunky remote and the tin can sounding speakers.

The set works well enough, but there are better options out there. In the last year I have replaced all of out TV with Samsung LCDs. 5 in total. Recently my wife asked for a new TV in her sewing room. I figured I'd branch out and try a Vizio unit. While Vizio has sizable market share I can only imagine that it's based on price, not quality. I'll be specific:Weak points- Sound is very tinny and hollow sounding. Allowances must be made for such a small set, but a only slightly larger set in our kitchen sounds worlds better.- The remote is laughably cheap looking/feeling. Not only are the materials cheap, but the button layout is awkward. The four way rocker with select is difficult to use.- If you look closely at the picture of the front of the set you may see printing in the lower left area of the bezel. In person it is really obnoxious. I like the fact that it has all these features, but I don't need to have it plastered on the front of the device. Vizio must be trying to appeal to a NASCAR crowd.- The picture is fairly washed out. No matter the settings the picture looks more washed out and grey than any of our other sets.Good points:- Wifi set was painless. I wasn't even going to use the wireless capabilities, but it found our network instantly locked on.- Netflix app is a nice feature. Selection is fairly weak, but it's a nice bonus.Conclusion:For an extra $50 I'll be going back to Samsung for our next TV.

After uploading the proof of purchase, I was given a case number and told that I will be contacted by the Tech support in 2 business days. However, even after 5 days, no response. Finally I called back Vizio tech support. After holding for a long time, I was transferred to Level 1 support. After reviewing the case number, I was transferred to Level2 tech support. In the middle of the call, I was disconnected. Again I called back. Reached Level 1 tech support and then Level 2 tech support. Finally the Level 2 support agreed that the TV is at fault and asked me to send the TV to the the service center at CA at  my own cost. This means the shipping cost will be around $70 to$ 80 which I have to bear from my own pocket and wait for 2 to 3 weeks. Vizio Tech support is very disappointing.

I took the tv into the living room, hooked up an ethernet cable, applied the firmware update, and was able to connect wirelessly.  Except for Netflix and TedTV, I don't think my son will get much use from the internet apps, but it was nice to get them up and running.I bought this tv because of the internet applications, but after repeated tries, during which the tv found my network, I painstakingly entered my password, and the tv failed to connect, I was not able to to connect wirelessly and try them out.  The tv is too small for the room in which my router and modem live, so connecting with a cable is not an option.  Since the whole point of the purchase was to enable my son to watch Netflix and similar content in his room without my having to worry about him clicking on an inappropriate or virus-enabling link, that purpose has been soundly defeated by the device's inability to connect to my recent model airport extreme base station.  As noted above, a firmware update solved the connectivity issues, so, if you're thinking about buying this, you may want to set it up next to your cable modem / router, and then move it to the room in which you want it.The sound quality leaves much to be desired.  When I was setting it up with my cable box, I had another tv on in the room - an old Samsung 17 inch lcd - that sounded noticeably clearer.That's the bad.  The good is that the picture quality is excellent.  The form factor is lovely.  It leaves a lot more room than its predecessor did on my son's desk.

Technical Service was great but the solution is terrible: although covered by the warranty any TV less than 30 inches needs to be sent by the buyer to the west coast (at your own expense) for repair.  What a terrible consumer policy!  First, you better have room to store your empty cartons until the warranty expires; then pack and send, at no minor cost, for repair and then wait.  Second, VIZIO has a corporate shipping account that costs them a fraction of what it will cost the consumer yet they refuse to issue a prepaid shipping label stating that is more cost effiecient (for them) to have the consumer burden the cost.  This is not stated in the warranty documentation so I beleive that this is a deceptive practice.  Had I known this was the policy I would have never purchased this product. Good luck.

This is hooked up to an indoor antenna and it gets decent reception.  We also have it connected to our wifi router for streaming Netflix and Pandora.Picture: Beautiful.  1080P is really nice.  This is our first LED TV and the contrast is awesome.  No complaints here.Connectivity: Had some issues with it connecting to the internet.  The WIFI router appeared, but we couldn't connect to it.  After 3-4 calls to technical support, we were able to reset the connection by renaming the SSID (I chose a new name without a comma).  Not sure the actual reason, but it connected finally.  Vizio tech support was really quick to pick up (no runaround voice prompts and button pushing).  I was impressed with the support both online and on the phone.Netflix: Works great and the UI is almost as good as Xbox 360 as it allows you to search and browse available movies/TV shows.  Streaming takes a bit to load, but once it's up the stream is seamless.Pandora: We were planning for this to replace our Sony iPhone dock to listen to Pandora.  Unfortunately, there are some bugs with it.  Streams take forever to load and if you do anything to it, like skip or back up, Pandora freezes up.  We have not been able to use this for Pandora reliably.Hulu Plus: Streaming is perfect. Interface is a bit sluggish, but it's nice to see movie info while movie is running in a PIP window.  Overall, nice presentation.Other Apps (Yahoo Widgets): Tried the Weather App and the TV Guide App...both were useful.Reception: The ATSC tuner is not as sensitive as our previous TV (Sceptre X23BV-Naga).  Channels that we were able to get before no longer are available.  So overall, good...not great reception.Audio: I've read the issues with the speakers, but really it's better than the Sceptre we previously had.  Not great, but passable.  Music does sound a bit tinny, but dialog is fine.  Audio Settings were almost non-existent which doesn't help.Mounting: Not VESA compliant and connections are perpendicular to the TV so it's only meant to be a desktop/bartop device.  Not an issue for us, but just be aware of this if you need it mounted.FINAL VERDICT: Highly recommended.  Once the internet issues were solved, TV works perfectly as expected.  For the price and features, you can't beat it.  No Roku or Apple TV necessary.  If you can get pass the audio and no mounting issues, it's the perfect kitchen/office TV.UPDATE 2/28: I just saw in the manual that you can mount this thing with a wall mount bracket that attaches to the back of the unit.

If you move a couple of feet off center (45\u00b0 or so), you start to get major color shifts and it's basically unwatchable. Vertically, it has a threshold of maybe 10-20\u00b0 before it becomes unwatchable. This TV forces you to watch it straight on.

It seems to be well built and feels of quality. The picture quality could not be better for a small and relatively cheap set.The remote is not that bad. I have a drawer full of remotes from various TVs, receivers, and other gear and it is rare that the remote that comes with a product is well laid out and comfortable to use- with few exceptions. Could it be better, yes. Would it stop me from buying the set, no. I think there was a design change in the remote, since the one that shipped with my set does not look like the one pictured in the manual. Buttons are in pretty much the same place, but the shape is more brick-like than curvy. So I guess Vizio made a running change. Not sure if I have the old style or new.Configuring and WIFI was easy to setup. Found my wireless right away. Word of caution: don't spend a lot of time adding apps and configuring them to your liking for the first couple of days, since Vizio pushes firmware updates in the background (which you have no control over) and I have twice had to add back in apps, delete the pre-installed apps I did not want, and (like with Pandora) re-enter my username/passwords. Some of the available apps fall way short of their potential or are pure garbage.The QAM tuner had no problems finding several non-encrypted channels on my Comcast service, and while the process is a bit tedious, it is easy to delete (skip) channels you don't care to watch. One disappointment is that the TV does not allow you to manually apply a label to the channels. While the set tags some channels from the data received over the cable, many are just numbers.The Bad:>Like other reviewers have stated the sound quality is pretty tinny. There is not much hope for it, regardless of the settings and EQ. No low-end at all. This is the major flaw of this otherwise pretty good TV. I'm sure the sound would be fantastic if output to an external amp and speakers.>The wall mounting arrangement could be improved. Most wall-mountable sets are pre-tooled to accept a VESA standard mount directly to the back of the set. This one has an adapter (included) that attaches in place of the tabletop stand that can be wall mounted directly or mated to a VESA type wall bracket. This will make the set stand out from the wall more than some might like when coupled with another bracket. In my installation, this was not an issue (corner mounted with an articulating bracket), but I do not like how the Vizio wall adapter attaches low on the set, making hard to conceal the mounting. An unintended plus: I was able to set the AC power brick on the Vizio bracket hinge to stow it out of sight.>The set has pretty good viewing angles side to side, but not from below. So, if you mount it high on a wall, the picture will wash out if you stand below the set and look up at it. Seems okay from a few feet back, however.>Start up time is a bit long, at about 10 seconds.>The lighted logo. I would say this is very well done with a quality, flush look that is evenly illuminated. It is amber when the set is off, and white when on. Unfortunately, there is no way to turn it off- at all. It can be distracting at times (dark scenes with room lights dimmed) and would be annoying to have that amber glow in a bedroom at night- unless, of course, you needed a nightlight, then it's a bonus! A little black tape does the trick.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice little TV", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R25UOWRHINWNMS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had this TV for a couple of weeks now and for the price I think it was a great purchase. I had been using a laptop connected to my daughter's TV to get Netflix on there and it was just okay. I hooked this TV up as a replacement and its been an awesome upgrade. I can't speak to the performance of the wireless because I have it hooked up via ethernet but the ease of use is very nice. My daughter is 8 years old and she can work the menus very easy, unless we are talking about the sleep timer and I think that she has issues there because she likes to sleep with the TV on although the sleep time is not as easy as a one-button setup. The picture quality is great. The Netflix programs will start off a little pixelized but when the program is buffered the quality smooths out. The viewing angles are good too. One complaint it that the inputs are all directly out of the back. I prefer when they are parallel to the screen so you can mount the TV flat against the wall. That being said we chose to sit it on a dresser where it works fine. The remote seems kind of big, I thought that it had a min-keyboard stashed beneath the regular keypad but I guess its just fat. I haven't done much with the Prime video supplied by Amazon, other than to sign in and get it connected. Once more programming shows up I will have to try it out. As for the Facebook and Twitter apps I can't say much there either. I don't want my Facebook or Twitter stuff showing up on my daughter's TV so I didn't login to those services.

In concept, they are, but the remote is so bad that is makes navigation a pain in the bum. Also, the Hulu app is pretty awful to navigate as well. In fact, one of my biggest complaints with this TV is the remote. The remote either lags or double presses when you use it. The apps are slow to move through - you have to click through each one to get to the one you need. I suspect the interface will improve with time.Though this TV boasts \"SRS TruVolume and SRS TruSurroundHDTM audio\" the sound is not great. I messed with several settings and just could not get a sound I liked. I ended up plugging in external speakers to get a decent sound to come out of the TV.The wi-fi is good.

Unfortunately that wasn't quite long enough: at 141 days the TV tuner's audio function failed (although the non broadcast audio inputs still work).  Even on day 1, the sound quality was no better than a $9 clock radio: very thin case + small rear firing speakers contribute to unusually tinny sound (Folks, what's the fascination with ultra thin cases, anyway?  It only makes the audio engineer's job more difficult).  In the past few weeks the picture has been flickering on and off.  When the picture flickers back on, the channel indicator comes on, which might or might not mean that the signal has been lost because the video portion of the tuner is also failing.  (Or my OTA antenna is not strong enough, or the Vizio's tuner is not sensitive enough.  Problem is intermittent, increasing in frequency)  Regarding the internet streaming function, it takes 2.5 to 3 minutes to handshake with Netflix via both WIFI and hard wired Ethernet cable before a movie begins to play, or to restart movie playing after a long pause.  By way of comparison, a Roku box feeding into the same TV only takes 20 seconds to start a movie via WIFI.  Additionally, the TV has lost track of the WIFI network security code, requiring reentry a couple of times.  Positives are that the remote and case are pleasant looking (the case is ultra thin!), and the picture is bright enough when viewed straight on (there is significant light falloff when viewed above or below the screen's central axis, not as bad laterally).  Too bad that this TV's reliability and functionality come up seriously short or fail in multiple categories.  While many Amazon reviews report high levels of satisfaction with the Vizio brand, from here it looks like a crap shoot.  Stung once, next time I'll put less emphasis on extra features at a low price, and look for more highly regarded brands reviewed on Amazon and ConsumerSearch.  Unfortunately, detailed TV reliability data is hard to find.  Maybe the next TV will cost me an extra $50.  Worth it.Update: sound started working correctly again, who knows what was going on.

The only draw back is when I hid my wireless signal from public searches, the TV no longer finds the signal even after manual input is rendered into the TV itself. But easily remedied by not hiding the signal, which is not required by most users. The 22 inch is perfect for bedroom use, but for some reason Vizio added a light to the Vizio logo and power cord. Surprisingly, the blue light on the cord is brighter than the logo light. While it's cool during day use, it's not so nice in a bedroom, particularly if you like the room completely void of lights. But easily remedied with electrical tape placed over logo and cord. The wireless even works well three stories away from the router.The sound is definitely not the best quality. At first I didn't notice the huge sound discrepancy between stations and the included Internet apps, such as Hulu, Netfix and Amazon Plus. On some shows I could barely hear get the volume past a whisper. I've since hooked up a pair of after market speakers to fix this issue. Unsure if it's an app issue or the TV but regardless the speakers were not working well on different channels, something the new speakers remedied.The remote control was not designed for human hands, it's shaped like a brick with very little comfort but easy to navigate. The keys are somewhat low profile and it's easy to hit the wrong one if not paying attention.All in all I really enjoy the features and only took off one star for the poor quality sound. Everything else is minor in comparison to the quality and price of this t.v.UPDATE: After almost two months of use, This week, I've noticed the TV turns off periodically and reboots. It's quite annoying and after some research I discovered this is an issue with almost all the Vizio T.V.s. Just Google \"Vizio tv turns off\" and you will find others with the same issue and Youtube demonstrations of what the tv is doing.

I have Vizio bluetooth headphones which are an awesome match to my Amazon.com-purchased ASUS netbook. All factors are rated high (pic, sound, etc.) and I still recommend Vizio as a TV brand. The problem was/is in the App; VIA software. Because there's no keyboard, only a remote, the initial setup is time-consuming; however, you'd think that once you do it you are done. However, I've had to do it several times now, as this is the prescribed solution from Vizio, whenever the internet does not allow Netflix, Facebook or Hulu Plus (any internet app) to connect. I will try to connect one, and the results say that it cannot connect to the internet. I can run a connection test, which produces the download speed of the connection; my TV is Ethernet-connected to my surfboard wireless cable modem.I contacted Vizio by email, my preference; they did reply promptly, recommending \"power cycling\" - unplug the TV & Modem for a half-minute and then wait for everything to reset. If this does not work (and it rarely does), then you must reset your TV from scratch; a long tedious process. I told Vizio that no customer wants to go through all these steps just to watch TV. Finally they gave me their toll-free number but offered no final solution, and I believe it's because they know of the flaw; a software problem, but they yet to have a cheap solution (too expensive to recall all VIA-ready TVs). I suggested an over-the-net patch, much like what is done w/computers, for this portion of the TV is a computer.I'm guessing that this is not limited to the Vizio brand however, because the same App program can be found in many other TV brands. Whenever my TV refuses to connect the TV app (the VIA) I can still connect to Netflix (wirelessly) with my ASUS net book tethered to my TV, and watch Netflix that way; the TV becomes a monitor. Now, since you can do this with any PC (tower or laptop) with a wired connection (RGB or HDMI) to any modern TV, the decision becomes, if you want to spend extra for the Internet App on any TV brand, or for now, just buy a tether and use a PC until they master the technology.

I didn't want something huge, as I would be traveling with it also. If I were to spend so much money, I thought, I might as well get one with a TV tuner, or just get a TV that could double as a monitor. Having 1080p, LED, and the ability to stream Netflix were the features of this monitor - excuse me, TV - that were the selling point for me, as I could not find another one in this size and at this price point.Ease of setup without looking at the manual was good, though typing in all the information (name, email address, etc. for registration with Vizio and Wifi and Netflix registration) could have been easier if I could have plugged in a keyboard. Is that possible? I don't know, for I still haven't opened the manual yet. Locating and hooking up to our Wifi router was a breeze except for the former complaint of using the remote to type in the password.I originally was very close to returning this monitor/TV, for the first few minutes using it with my laptop gave me an incredible headache. I then got the bright idea that it may not be the monitor, but the settings. I changed the Picture Settings from Standard to Movie, which made reading the text MUCH easier on the eyes. I changed a couple of other settings that make it more visually manageable, such as turning the color enhancement off, noise reduction to low, Adaptive Luma to low, and Ambient Light Sensor to Middle. Therefore, I'm probably going to keep this thing.The thinness and weight are going to be VERY helpful in my travels; my, have we progressed since the days of luggables!It's much easier to see the pixellation (sp?) of text characters, which is not the fault of the monitor, but maybe a fault of Vista or my graphics processor, which is actually just shared memory. I might need to upgrade to a new laptop soon :-).There's only one button on the monitor itself, the power button, which has a rotating wheel around it. Pressing the power button brings up a small menu that includes controlling volume, channel, input source, exit, and power off. If you want to change anything else, DON'T LOSE THE REMOTE!!!!The aesthetics of the remote are very bland compared to a 32\" Vizio within the family. It's more like a brick - short, fat, and a bit bulky. The buttons have a good clicking feel when pressed; it just doesn't seem like much thought was given to making it look pretty.The stand can let the TV tilt about five degrees down and twenty degrees up. That's a complete guess, and my profession is NOT in geometry.I haven't paid much attention to sound, but I'm sure it's crappy, as what other reviewers have said.

You are able to make changes to the EQ and it does help. A little more mid-range would have been great and there isn't much low end at all which gives it a tinny sound.

I looked forever trying to find a small sound bar but everything I could find was over 30 inches long...would not have looked to good under the tv that is 22 inches.

Stereo separation is not the best but for bedroom sound it really does sound much better. It added more midrange and just enough bass to round it out. The good thing is the Monster speaker has 1/8 input and uses USB to keep it charged so I was able to use both of those connections on the Vizio.Firmware can be a pain. I bought this to use Hulu Plus and it took 3 firmware upgrades before it appeared. You cannot do a manual update. So the tv needs to be in standby to update. Once you turn it on again the upgrade may appear. I had to do this a couple times before it happened.

The set comes pre-configured for wireless connectivity - if you have a router in your home this TV will be able to access the internet - the setup process is very quick and easy.I purchased this to watch TV while I am exercising on the treadmill.  The 22\" screen is the perfect size (I am about 3 feet away from the screen).  The $220 price tag on this TV is well worth it for the quality... and the fact that I am more likely to exercise now!Here are the Internet Video Apps that this TV supports and that I am currently using:- Netflix: currently $7.99 a month - A wide selection of movies and television shows, commercial free.  Unlimited streaming.- Hulu Plus: currently $7.99 a month - A lot of great new television content.  You can watch many TV shows the day after they air.  Unlimited streaming.- Amazon Instant Video: You pay per title, and can either buy or rent.  To get you started, Amazon is currently offering a $5 credit when you link this TV to the Amazon Instant Video app.It is very easy to link your TV to your existing video subscription accounts.  It is also very convenient that the TV keeps you logged in to these services... you don't have to sign in each time you turn the TV on.  Video Quality on all of the above services is great when watching on this TV, and loading times are typically fast (will depend on your internet connection).A note about video search/selection:  The remote does not have any keys for letters, this makes searching for movies/TV shows by name very difficult and it can get frustrating.  I would recommend that if you are planning on using this TV with one of the video services listed above, put all videos into your queue/favorites list.

You're not getting a TV this tiny as the cornerstone of your home entertainment center.

The picture itself isn't the best I've seen at this size, but it's still very good.  Those are the pros.The cons - Sound quality is pretty bad, channel changing is SLOW if you're connecting your coax directly to the TV (rather than an external box), and the remote control has soft buttons that don't seem to \"connect\" with the TV each time they're pressed.  However, that could just be the slow lag of the TV itself, as I stated before.Despite the cons, this TV does what it's meant to do, and is fine for casual \"sometimes\" use.

(I use a chimney mounted antenna for all my TVs)What makes this TV stand out (besides the great picture) are the internet apps.  There are plenty to choose from and it has all the standards such as Netflix, Pandora, Hulu and even Amazon Instant Video, to name a few.  Wi-Fi setup was a breeze and I was streaming to the TV in less than 30 minutes from the time I opened the box.The only negative is the sound.  As others have stated, it's bad!  You can't expect great sound from such a small TV and I knew this.  There's not much you can do about it either except attach external speakers but due to space limitations, this is not an option for me.  I'll just have to get used to it.

In my opinion the  Vizio is definitely better than a three but not quite so good as a four.  Why?Well, first of all the remote control is tremendously frustrating.  Remotes have been around for decades now and one would think that Vizio could have come up with something a little more sensitive than the clunker they include with the beautiful TV.  And it is a little beauty.Second reason for the half-star is the color adjustablity issue.  Adjustment is done on-screen, of course, and with the remote, which is no doubt part of the problem.  There are a myriad of choices for the color and it literally took me days to come up with a combo that actually looks natural and that I don't have to continually tweak to avoid blue grass and yellow skies.  I must say, though, that once resolved, the picture I get is great.Now, for the good stuff.  I really do love this guy despite his wicked stepmother of a remote.  It LOOKS good and is light weight enough (I have the 22 inch model) to just pick up and move to another room if I want.  That could also be a drawback if there are young children or rambunctious pets around...it could easily be knocked over...it is very light weight. However, it does come with a wall-mount gadget if you want to keep it in one place.  I got this for the computer area of my family room but use it more in the bedroom as it turns out.Finally, why have a TV if the picture isn't any good...I think the quality is excellent for this compact little set at a very compact and affordable price.  The sound could be a bit better but is tolerable with lots of room for volume adjustment.  Bottom line is I am very happy with my purchase.  It arrived a day early, the directions are totally easy to understand, assembly requires NO tools and is a dream (just putting the set on the stand) and set up amounts to plugging it in and letting it find your wireless connection.

I also read other reviews where Vizio customer service/technical support blamed the issue on the router, the wires, power source etc.  **shakes head**  Really Vizio?!?!?

The tv remote is ok not that bad it is responsive I don't find my self repeatedly pressing one button cause it doesn't work one con about the remote would prob be that it has no backlighting so in the dark u can't see buttons but not a big deal for me because I have this tv on my office desk.

Pretty straightforward to hook up and to program, and setup too.  Kids love the easy to use remote, easy navigation from one thing to another, and of course using NetFlix, which is primarily what they do.  It does a lot of great things for us, we have had it up for some time now, and have experienced the cool, the strange, and the \"just the way it is, but thumbs up\", of it all.Before I start, I would say we would buy this again.  It just surprised me on some notes, but, after some getting used to it, we now like the things that at first gave us pause.  Mostly.Bad speakers.  But, this is for the kids, and the sound doesn't carry into the living room like it used to with the old tv.  It stays more concentrated within that room, and although it is tinny sounding, it is heavy on the voices, and disproportionately light on any other sounds on anything you may want to watch.  We now realize that we like that.Finicky, to be sure.  When switching from an app, like NetFlix, to watch shows from the DVR in the living room which it is hard-wired to, it seems to take an awful long time, or, it may even restart itself, or turn off.  Not a big deal, just hope that it gets no more freaky than it already is.  Picture is great, considering it is small, and is chock full of all kinds of gear to do that job.  I have to admit, I spent an hour and a half, trying different settings, picture and volume controls, checking for firmware updates, etc., was worried as I worked on it, but we like it now.I am positive, seeing what was out to be purchased at the CES this year, that this all in one, all capable tv (with many more features than what this has currently), will be the trend for all tv's to come.A really great purchase, that the kids are super happy with, all with less sound leakage into the living room for Mom and Dad.

It's perfectly fine for our bedroom. If we want better, we'll get a cheap 2.1 or 5.1 sound system.As for the VESA wall/arm mounting system, it does add an inch or two of depth because of the bracket you need to attach. This is because all the inputs and outputs are at the center of the back of the TV where it attaches so it must be spaced out to allow space for the cables. Works just fine for our swing arm mount but it's not exactly sleek.The backlight control options are numerous, but I'm not sure how helpful the automatic backlight adjustment really is.The firmware upgraded within a day of connecting the system, and after the initial boot-up it doesn't take too long to come on.Considering we kept our previous 15\" Element TV for 4+ years, I'm sure this one will last even longer.

We replaced a 13\" CRT TV with this one and are very impressed.  The picture quality is excellent; we have it connected to a DISH HD receiver via HDMI.I like everything about it except the following four points:- The sound is tinny.- The speakers are on the back of the TV, causing the sound to bounce off the wall behind it. It's an odd effect, but easy to get used to.- The web apps are awesome, but they are sometimes slow-loading or slow to respond when selecting apps. Our local news station has an app which allows us to see the current temp, tower cams, and news videos at any time. We can also stream Amazon videos (Go Prime!) and Netflix movies, as well as choose from a decent selection of other web sources.- Occasionally we'll get a \"NO SIGNAL\" error after closing out of a web app. We'll have to power off the TV, wait a few seconds, then power it back on to get the signal to return.I'd like to rate this 4 1/2 stars because I think the exceptions I listed above are either minor or to be expected, but I rated it 4 stars because I don't want to give an impression of perfection by giving it 5 stars.[8-MONTH UPDATE] After using this for 8 months, I wanted to provide an update. I feel my original points are still valid. However, we have not had the no-signal issue lately, which makes me think it was a bad cable.  I will add that if you turn off the TV by accident, it will take about a minute until you're able to turn it back on. I also find that some of the web apps do not allow you to fast forward video, and if you stop the video, you will have to restart the video from the beginning.

Instead they seem to buy products from no name Chinese companies and market them under their own name.The product in question was bought from Walmart for $229 (with free shipping) in 12/10.While wireless Internet access was sluggish in initial connection, it did actually work.Then, after approximately 18 months, Internet wireless access ceased to function, despite diagnostic tests built into the unit, which indicated it was working properly.My only experience is with this particular unit, not with the larger units that you will find in the big box stores or online, but given my experience with this unit I will stick to a name brand for large units. All our flat screen TVs have been Samsung, and I see that Sharp seems to be getting some rave reviews recently (since Samsung seems to keep their pricing model high).What I can tell you is that I will not be buying any Vizio TV in the future.The Vizio comes with a one-year warranty. All my other big-screen TVs are many years old and have had no problems.The cost to repair this $229 item out of warranty (i.e., after one year) from the outsourced repair facility in Boca Raton, Florida, recommended by Vizio was a $40 inspection fee plus $110 repair, plus one-way shipping (which considering packing materials and shipping costs would equal another $40). Adding that altogether ($190) my potential savings for having the defective unit repaired even though over a year and a half old was $39 even after the grief of going through the process. For less than half this amount I can buy a Roku, hook it up and accomplish the same thing.My review is to caution anyone thinking about buying a Vizio unit is that you are buying something not manufactured from the company selling it to you.  Given my quick Google search \"Vizio sucks,\" it appears that there are hundreds of others with problems far more serious than my own because they bought Vizio's larger flat screen TVs.My advice - stay with a name brand such as Samsung or Sharp (or Sony if you want to overpay!).Otherwise, if you look at a 22-inch TV as \"disposable\" over a short life span, and also get a \"deal,\" then amortize the cost and go ahead and buy it.To me the pain of diagnosing the problem was not worth the effort.Plus just having the broadcast channels is useless!", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "My first TV", "Author": "Anwar", "ReviewID": "RZE054D5HF2FY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Alright, the tv was good for its price, I bought speakers with it as I read a lot of the reviews that recommended getting speakers for this tv.

Kudos to Amazon for both fast delivery and painless return,though. I have owned numerous LCDs and know the initial start-up drill pretty well. This Vizio, though, gave me problems trying to type/label inputs, plus correct entries. I couldn't find any manual or other guidance on how to do this with the remote. The biggest problem I had, however, was loading channels onto the TV. I wanted to use cable right out of the wall rather than a box since this would only be a secondary TV and NetFlix option. I also can get HD stations for all of the major networks right from the wall. Unfortunately, the tuner couldn't pick up those channels; it only could load about 20 pretty average-to-lousy looking analog channels.I already have a Samsung hybrid monitor that picks all the channels; so the Vizio wasn't going to be worth keeping.With a cable box and a little more patience than I had, this TV could be a good solution for someone.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture, inadequate sound", "Author": "Curtis G", "ReviewID": "R3SB5IFJCXOINS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was finally time to replace the bulbous 27\" dinosaur in the bedroom. The original plan was to move the Panasonic TC-L32X2 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV with iPod Dock to the bedroom and put a 42\" TV in the living room, but my wife thought a smaller TV might suffice. Turns out that 22\" is too small (our viewing distance is about 10 feet in a 12x12 room). That said, there's a lot to like about this TV.What I like: Price, easy connection to my home wireless network, headphone jack (I like using wireless headphones), an amazingly clear picture (I found myself watching movies I wouldn't otherwise have watched, simply because I couldn't tear myself away from the stunning visuals), 1080p, and Internet widgets. (Being able to watch Netflix streaming movies without an extra box is pretty cool.)What I don't like: Size, preset picture modes are either too dark or wildly inaccurate (I would run Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics [Blu-ray] if I were to keep it), and the big one: the speakers are terrible. The sound is incredibly tinny and there is no audio adjustment to add bass or reduce treble that I could find.This might be the right unit for a kitchen or an RV, but not for our bedroom.

For a cheap, low-end TV, they are great.  They take a lickin' and keep on tickin'  HOWEVER, for the software necessary with a \"smart\" TV, it is worth spending the extra money for a better device.  This TV doesn't work with NJ Cablevision.  We bought two.  Neither worked with our router and modem.  (Not even when hooked up directly via ethernet.)  We had Cablevision out to work on them.  No go.  We purchased a new $150 Netgear Router.  No go.  We called Vizio - who informed us that their TV's don't work well with Netgear OR Linksys (the two most popular routers available).  We finally through in the towel and returned the TV's.  We went with LG's and have been VERY happy.  We tried the Sony, and although they worked fine with our router and Cablevision, we liked the apps better with LG.  Just a personal preference I guess.  I can't speak to the apps on the Vizio because we never saw them.  Sometimes you need to spend a little more to get a truly \"smart\" TV.

I saw many problems with this, but he insisted that it would be a great thing. When his birthday came around I was at a loss as to what to get him. Then I found this tv. I bought it from amazon on sale. I was interested in it because I could use it without a cable box, antennae, or DVD player.... all things I would not want in my bathroom. I am sick of cords every where so to find a tv that can function with just one was great. The husband was ecstatic. We set it up painlessly that night and watched some videos from the amazon prime service. The screen tilts up or down to make viewing easier.I love the apps being easy to navigate through. Everything runs smoothly without the hesitation I was expecting. I was pleased with the picture quality, but the sound is as others have described. I'm not one to spend a lot on electronics so my tvs are all very low budget, but I have never had one sound this bad.

This particular tv is available at locations such as Sam's Club for about forty-fifty dollars less.  They also offer free shipping.  Another thing offered by legitimate retailers is a warranty.  If you have a problem with your tv, you can easily take it back to Sam's Club, or wherever you bought it, and you will be given an immediate exchange or refund.  No hassles.  Want to return an electronic device to an Amazon third party seller?  Hmmm....Well, good luck.  First of all, you're going to be boxing it up and shipping it back (at your expense).  That is, provided that they will accept a return at all.  Then you can wait several weeks for them to get it in the mail, send it back to where they bought it (Walmart, Sam's, etc) and then get a new one shipped to you.Amazon is great about returns.
