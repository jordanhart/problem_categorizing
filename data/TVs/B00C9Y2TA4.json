I have a built in enclosure and this TV fit it with an 1/8\" to spare. I went from a 46 LCD to a 50\" LED because this item was very slim. The only problem I had once I got it was the picture looked weird and fake. Found the Motion Enhancement setting was on, so I turned it off. Picture went back to normal and I was much happier. The NETFLIX app is great, and you can watch a movie with only a few clicks. I don't like that the functionality doesn't work with my DIRECTV remote, but oh well. So far this TV has been awesome and is much better than the 46\" Samsung it replaced.I am updating my review after a few months of usage. TV works well, except for Netflix streaming. We have had daily drops that require unplugging and restarting the TV. it seems to lose wireless connection or the app crashes frequently. I had to get a wired connection to the TV, and have somewhat better results. Sharp customer support is also very poor and slow to respond. There are better products out there, I cannot recommend this at 5 stars I had before.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive TV with a quality build and picture", "Author": "J. Worosylo \"J. W.\"", "ReviewID": "RPBVKE49R2OD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was simply looking for a replacement of my 10yr (yes 10yr) old Sharp Aquos LC-30HV4U.  Since i had a sharp for 10yr without a single issue, I decided it was wise to stick with them.I paid $728 for this TV last week when it was on sale and boy, what a bargain. They call this a smart tv, but to be honest, i already have an Apple TV, xbox, and PS3 so I didnt really need any more smarts.Picture:  Very good for the price.  when you view off center by about 20 degrees or so, you start to lose color saturation and the contrast starts to degrade, but its tolerable.  Since we view this straight on this is a non issue for us.  The 120Hz is nice for sports.  I basically have two setups:  one for regular TV view and one for sports, both are great settings.Sound:  Compared to my forward facing speakers of the old 30HV4U, the sound was a bit disappointing.  However, having had it for a week now, im used to it.  We have it mounted on the wall and it sounds just fine for regular TV watching (it will not replace a good soundbar or separate speakers with an amp).Overall, i'm very happy with the TV so far.  For $728, it was a steal in my opinion.Let me know if you have any questions about the TV and i'll be happy to look into it for you.UPDATE-1-30-14:  Just FYI, if you're buying this set for gaming, don't.  Though still a great TV for movies and shows, the input lag makes playing games extremely difficult, especially if the game you're playing requires quick reaction time.

I'll never make that mistake again.  I bought it from Sears and the first one kept randomly powering off.  I barely caught the 30 day return period, didn't get their warranty because it's triple the price of a comparable square-trade warranty.The second one would power off and not turn back on.  I can't say enough BAD things about Sharp customer service.  Not-so-sharp non-customer service is a more accurate statement.  Their representative told me that I had the power saving option on and that if they sent a repairman, I would have to pay for the service call.  After popping some nitro-glycerin tablets (metaphorically), I asked for his supervisor who did send a local repair shop to look at the TV.  They ordered parts which took 3 weeks to get from Sharp.After they replaced the parts the TV was worse.  It wouldn't even stay on for 5 minutes.  The repair shop took the TV again and said they replaced all the power-related parts that Sharp recommended.  I got the TV back and it is doing the same thing that the first TV was doing, randomly turning off then back on.  Try watching a Netflix movie while that's happening!So now I've had a TV since July 3, 2013 that has been totally unusable.  That's almost 5 months with a piece of $800 black plastic crap sitting in my living room that doesn't work.  I called Sharp and demanded a replacement TV.  They first offered me a refurbished version of the same model.  I argued with them that I was basically paying $800 for a refurbished TV since I've never had one that worked properly.  The also told me that the warranty was still only 1 year from the original purchase price.  Unbelievable!  They then told me that they didn't have that model in stock and were going to give me last year's model LC52LE640U refurbished.  Are you kidding me!  So I paid $800 for last years model refurbished with an 8 month warranty!Go read the reviews on LC52LE640U (http://www.amazon.com/Sharp-Aquos-LC52LE640U-52-Inch-LED-LCD/product-reviews/B0076LY17E).  They're giving me a piece of crap in place of the other piece of crap.  Sounds like they have some real quality issues with power.

The SmartCentral offerings of Netflix, Vudu, or CinemaNow is pathetic and stays pathetic as Sharp offers no firmware upgrades for this set.  It is was it is and will stay that way.  If you want more services like Hulu or Amazon Prime videos, you will need to buy another set or use your PS3, Blu-Ray, etc...  Picture and set up are OK.  Sound for me is an issue.

I have several of the current generation TV's in my house. I have two LC-60LE650U models (Living Room & Bedroom), two LC-50LE650U (office & behind my bar in the basement) and the LC-80LE857U in my home theater. I have ZERO complaints about any of the other TV's in my house (these 50 inch models were the last to be bought in my home), however I think that the software that is shipped with these TV's is buggy. Once received it ships with v2.12 (at least my models did), if you go to manual update as I did it shows 2.13 is available but when you try to download it it just reboots the TV with no update being performed. Oddly enough I went to try again today after waiting a month or so and it shows that my software is now v2.19 but that version is not even listed on Sharps own website.Furthermore the \"Send to TV\" feature in iOS for Youtube does not function what-so-ever but does function flawlessly on my 60\" and 80\" models with the auto-pair feature. Clearly some type of software issue. The TV's (50 inch) did work for a time using my iPhone 4S but completely stopped again. It has never worked with my new iPad (3rd generation).For those of you looking for a TV with Youtube capabilities I'd look elsewhere until they update/upgrade their software. I am half temped to see if I can put the software for the 60 Inch on these 50 Inch models as they are from the same series, just different sizes and the newer 60\" update contains a Youtube app update which I think is needed on the 50\". I am however nervous about bricking my 50\" TV in the process of trying. Anyone else attempt it or encounter these problems?", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sharp Smart HDTV Reboot Problem", "Author": "R.

I ended up buying this TV because it was on clearance for $799.97, and it is the worst purchase I've made to date. The picture quality is fair, at times the image stutters and this shouldn't even be happening at 60Hz because our brain makes the motion fluid when viewing (keep in mind I'm fully aware of what 60Hz, 120Hz and 240Hz is and I despise watching anything if the refresh rate isn't 60Hz). I tried returning it but because it was on clearance there was nothing that could be done. So I'm stuck with this piece of crap product and definitely don't recommend buying anything from sharp.

Who still uses the TV speakers for a $1000 TV when you can set up a pretty decent soundbar for $150 or put it through a good brand, very competent AVR and speakers for $350?  http://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-YHT-397-5-1-Channel-Theater-Version/dp/B007PU2X76/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1390169800&sr;=1-6&keywords;=surround+sound+systemThe picture quality is excellent - very sharp (sorry) and very adjustable.  Out of the box, colors are not perfect but the adjustments are easy and you can personalize them for different uses.  120 hz motion enhancement works great for sports and nature.  No pixelating.  I have a 5 year old Samsung 1080p and every time I would go to the store, I would say, why doesn't my TV look like that?  Now with the Sharp, it does!  One thing that contributes to this is the thin bezel. A thin bezel really, really helps the watching experience.All that said, the viewing angle is not great.  The TV merits a 4.5 because of that but for my purposes, 5 is closer than 4.BTW, the Netflix app works great.  It works much better than my Sony DVD.  The problem is - like any TV/AVR- you have to get and attach a different cable  - probably optical, not HDMI - to get the sound from the TV to my AVR for surround sound.  This is not a big deal.
