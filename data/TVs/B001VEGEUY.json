After buying two HDMI cables, one for my cable box and one for my DVD player, it was ready to play.  If you have a home theater system I would assume you already have the optical cable for the DVD player as well.  This set is no longer available on Costco online.  I did not know anything about Sceptre.  I read dozens of the reviews they had.  Without the reviews the price made me skeptical about this brand.  The reviews were terrific.  Since the set is not available there, I came here to Amazon where I've had nothing but great experiences buying stuff.  For those like myself, that don't want to waste their time and money on turkeys, I felt an obligation to help, whomever.  I love this set.  The picture is spectacular.  There are lots of adjustments for sound and picture.  The PIP is not only sizable in that little extra screen you can move around, it will expand your PIP to approximately 21\" side by side with your other picture!  Then you can switch the audio.  For a sports fanatic like me, well...wow!  This set is better, yes better than I expected.  For a price so much lower than the Vizio's, Sharp's, Panasonic's, and Sony's, this set is a SLAM DUNK!I'm back. I've owned this set for 11 months as of this writing.  I still love it. FYI: My HD signal is from high speed cable (so I have no opinion on satellite quality). My DVD movies have always played great.  My son gave me a blue-ray player for Xmas and the blue-ray  picture is as astonishingly sharp as one should expect. I noticed the negative review was not this exact model. Don't understand complaints about contrast or anything else concerning the picture. There are four picture modes, vivid, mild, and standard which are pre-sets with color and contrast etc locked in. The one you'll use 99% of the time is \"custom\".  You can adjust no less than 14 different picture components, from the basics of color, brightness, contrast, hue etc. to fine-tuning adjustments for color temperature (3) and the amount of back-lighting.  There is no way you can't adjust this picture to any preference! The only negative (I don't think it's a negative for this price) but the native TV speakers are mediocre at best. I would strongly recommend having your own home theater sound system and this is not even an issue.", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "No it\u2019s not your hearing, it\u2019s the tv!", "Author": "Stephen Fish", "ReviewID": "R1IVRD7GRLLN5P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I\u2019ve owned this television for 6 years.

It\u2019s has a bundle of sound settings, to pick from, but they all sound like you\u2019re sitting in a echo chamber, and is very hard to understand speech.

The color scheme will randomly change to an un-viewable dark green color, and the volume is non-existent or blaring loud. In contacting the company, they made us go through some back-end menu commands to restore the picture and sound; no apology or offer to resolve the actual issue. This continues to happen every few weeks for her.Some time later, I found this model (in a very nice faux wood finish). After hooking up the TV, vertical lines ran across the screen on all inputs. After contacting the company through numerous e-mails over the course of weeks, they offered to fix the issue. They kept the TV for about 4 weeks, and when it was returned, the issue was worse than it was before. I tried to contact them again, and again I was met with slow response. I had to send them photos/video of the issue on two occasions because they apparently forgot about me. After keeping my TV for a few more weeks, I had to keep pestering them via e-mail until I got a response. They offered to replace the TV (though, not with the exact model), and that was about two weeks ago. Still haven't received anything. At this point, they have had the TV as long as I have.Terrible product, terrible customer service. You're better off going with anybody but Sceptre.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Start having Problems after 2 years", "Author": "G.

I did not know alot about Sceptre, but after research it seems they manufacture LCD computer monitors with good reviews.  I took the plunge with this being my first HD set and after over a year in use I am quite happy with the decision.  One thing that you cannot describe in words is that this set has a picture which will rival any high-end set you place it against.  There are ZERO complaint about picture quality at all, and in my opinion if you have any complaints you don't have it set up correctly.  Now some have issues with the picture setting and like a fellow reviewer stated, there are numerous adjustments available and with some (2 minutes) time you are golden.  The sound could be a bit better but for a stock speaker system its acceptable.One issue is that the remote has to be used at no more than 75 Degrees from center or it won't recieve. When sitting at the side of the television this is an issue.  Also, when wall mounted its very hard to get to all of the input/outputs without taking down the television or dislocating your shoulder to reach them.  I have ran VGA off it it a few times and this it a challenge to reach, but I have left one plugged in since and tucked it behind the television for later use.  18 months after purchase, I have no dead pixels or any serious issues to report.  The fit and finish of the television are very nice, the outer shell is beautiful and presents itself as good if not better than a Visio.  I am looking to purchase another televison soon and I will go far out of my way to purchase another one.  At one time Wal-Mart and Costco were selling these but I have since seen they are no longer available in this size.  I sure hope that changes.  Sceptre, well done, for the few who have taken the chance on this purchase, you have long time customers.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "High quality LCD TV. Don't think, just BUY!", "Author": "J. Lerner", "ReviewID": "R8GAKMX6DVDWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV, and wow. Amazing television. People need to understand that a non name brand does not always mean bad quality. I am an IT professional and have worked with electronics all of my life. Sceptre has been around a LONG time, and they are well known within the tech community. Rest assured they are not known in the television world but in reality that means nothing. They have been making monitors for 15 years now, and a television is simply a monitor with a few extra ports and processing.My philosophy is this. If you are going for high end, purchase a Sony. Anything else, get a brand you have never heard of like Sceptre. I will tell you that this television is of better build quality then Vizio, Phillips, RCA, LG, or Toshiba. It is of equal quality of Sharp, and Samsung.Spending lots of money on anything other than a Sony is stupid.Positive points:Size- 46\" shines in any living roomStyle- Rivals Sony and Samsung in stylePicture quality- 1080p is 1080p, rivals all of the major brands if not better. Good contrast ratios, brightness, and response time.Ease of use- Easy setupSound- Sound out of the box sucks, BUT if you turn off theater boost or whatever it's called, SOUNDS MUCH BETTERLCD Panel- Rated at 50,000 hours. That's 8 hours a day, for 15 years straight.Cons (Won't effect most units)From what I've read the power supply can get flaky after a few years of use. No problem though. Very easy repair, and cheap.Get this TV. You will not be disappointed. Word on the street is that Sceptre uses Sony parts, would explain a lot. Also Sceptre is US based.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "for X460-F120", "Author": "a user", "ReviewID": "RX2ACX17N261O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Firstly I own upgraded version of this, not exactly this one. (mine has 20,000 contrast ration, better than this one, and mine has 120Hz enabled.) However I have many problems with this one so I write my review here, for X460-F1201. poor contrast. Maybe the best movie to test contrast might be \"Charlie and chocolate factory\" I tried to tweak brightness and contrast a lot, but still lose details in shadowy scenes. (If I get more details in darkness, I would lose details in bright scenes.) Now I think I got somehow optimal condition to obtain maximal detail in both of darkness and brightness, but then my color looks a little bit weird. (not very vivid, as to say.)2. 120Hz function, as others said, does not work very well for action movies. I got pixelation (square boxes, that is broken pictures) in the case of \"Strong Motion blur free\" I tried other values but still got broken pictures.  Finally I just turn off this function.3. vibrating (blinking) edges: this does not occur always, but if the scene contains many stripes, sometimes they look to be vibrating (blinking)4. Sometimes TV has blackout for less than 1 second. This occures 0~2 times per one movie randomly.#1 and #3 did not happen with my excellent Dell 27'' monitor (which was $650). It is a really good monitor and it gives much better pictures than this TV.In fact, not this TV is not in good price anymore, if you look for \"LG 47LH30\" which might be even less expensive, but bigger. This LG's has far better contrast (50,000 VS 20,000) even though it does not provide 120Hz. Since this Sceptre's 120Hz does not mean much since it does not work well, I'd rather go to LG's proven technology or something else.I think Sceptre should provide firmware upgrade with a better algorithm, at least.", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "46\" Screen Flat Panel TV with LCD Technology for Crisp Images and Thin Design\nDisplays Resolutions up to 1080p\nIncludes Remote Control\nHD Display When Connected to an Optional HD Source\nATSC/NTSC/QAM Built-In\nVideo Features: Hi-Resolution Panel\nAudio Features: Selectable Sound Modes\nHigh Contrast and Brightness\nInputs: HDMI\nOutputs: S/PDIF\nOn-Screen HD Display\n16:9 Widescreen Aspect Ratio\n1920x1080 Resolution\nContrast Ratio: 8000:1\n6ms Response Time\n2 Speakers Front Panel Speakers\nOperational Modes: Multiple Picture Modes\nAdditional Functions: Computer Monitor\nCompatible with 108i/720p/480i/480p Resolution Specs/Video Modes Formats\nViewing Angles: 178x178\nSwivel Base monitor\nAccessories Included: Remote Control Batteries\n1 Year Warranty on Parts and Labor\n44.98\"x31.35\"x10\"\nweighs 71 lbs.", "Name": "SCEPTRE 46\" 16:9 6ms 1080p LCD HDTV X46BV-1080p", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tcckw5jQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001VEGEUY"}}
