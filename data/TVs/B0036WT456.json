{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Frank1701a", "ReviewID": "R36XZFDLLI7288", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had originally bought a Vizio LED 22inch.  It had poor sound and picture quality.  Since 2006 I've been avoiding Samsung products since I bought a DVD recorder from them that records DVD's that only play on the machine that records them.  My recorded DVD's wouldn't even play properly on another Samsung DVD player.  Back then I called them to tell them my problem; they basically told me I was out of luck. I was hoping to Archive some old home movies.At my house I have a Samsung DLP, and the beformentioned DVD player that upconverts the DVD's to high definition.  I also had an old style 13 inch Samsung TV that gave good service.I chose this Samsung 22 LED since I had seen it at Best Buy and saw that the picture quality was very good.  There is pixelation on dark scenes but this may be due to AT&T; U-Verse.  Aside from this the picture quality is very good and better than a supposed 1080p Vizio I had bought.  I later learned that the only place you can get 1080p is from a Blu Ray player. Cable/Satellite companies are broadcasting in 720p.The sound on this TV is excellent and it comes with different sound options, all of which sound very well.The only drawback so far on this TV is the on/off timer.  This is a feature I wanted to keep since my old 13 inch Samsung had it.  The weird thing about their On/Off timer is that when the TV comes on you can only choose from two source options, the USB drive or the coaxial cable connection.  So you can't wake up to the HDMI source setting of the TV, I don't know why they put this limitation into the design of the TV, it's very odd.  Hopefully they'll have a software update to correct it.From what I've understood from reading the manual it can't play quicktime movies, I haven'd had time to try one.  If it can't play quicktime videos that's another limitation the set should have corrected in the future.The design of the TV itself is very nice, and while the remote is a bit bulky it has all the basic functions.  I like that it has a sleep button right on the remote.  Some other TV's make you go through a long Menu to get to the sleep setting; when you are falling asleep pressing a button a few times is a lot easier than some intricate navigation menu.The OnScreen menu is easy to use once you figure out how to navigate around it.  A thoughtful feautre they put in is that when you highlight a choice such as \"digital noise filter\" an explanation comes on at the bottom of the screen indicating what this feature does.I liked that it has a PIP option.  The only thing you can watch in the PIP window is the coaxial cable connection though.  I hooked up my computer to the TV and was able to watch regular TV in the PIP window.I would definitely recommend this set to a friend.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "Eric F", "ReviewID": "RB07FNR975XWR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very happy with this samsung tv, purchasing it for my bedroom, its a much better fit in my small bedroom than my previous bulky 27\" tube tv. My only real complaint is the volume can be a little soft at times, but that is not really a major issue for a bedroom tv.  Still very highly recommended.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal TV!", "Author": "Lorraine", "ReviewID": "RMRBUP4HJD9P3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We are very happy with this TV. We had a 15-inch Sony Wega for 5+ years and the picture on that TV was a hard act to follow (we were sorry we had not purchased the 20-inch version 5 yrs ago).  Then, a couple of years ago we tried to upgrade to a 22-inch LCD TV but couldn't find anything that compared in clarity, sharpness, & crispness to the Wega picture.  However, this TV is phenomenal - the picture is excellent and the sound is fine (we use it in a small family room and kitchen - we just swivel it around on a turntable depending on the room we're in).  We had first purchased a Sony Bravia LCD but returned it - it did not compare to the Wega.  However, this Samsung LED does not disappoint and the design of the TV is beautiful and sleek. The only annoyance is that when you use the cable box remote for volume, you can't hold the volume button down and quickly advance the volume level - you have to keep pressing the volume control to advance the number one at a time.  The cable company said this is true with all the Samsungs and there's nothing they can do about that - so we just use the Samsung remote when we need to move the volume up or down quickly (not a big deal for us)and the only reason we gave it a 4 instead of a 5.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "A.

I noitcted that the higher end tvs from samsung have a higher refresh rate of 120hz which creates a motion blur, this tv on the other hand is 60mhz which there is no motion blur created when playing games.

Both are excellent sets with easy installation & exceptional picture quality. These sets are a part of our multimedia system where the main set is a 1.5 yr old 52 inch HDTV Samsung. All three sets have excellent TV tuners which seem to be a weak point on other manufacturer's product and, so far, the reliability of all sets has been 100% which is consistent with industry reliability reviews.

Terrible service", "Author": "AntonyB", "ReviewID": "R172C61C7MSTPA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "- The tuner wasn't able to detect certain channels automatically or manually, even though I had these channels on my previous TV- The plastic frame has a kind of red glow at the bottom, which is very unpleasant- The logic of the menus is totally insane- Most of all, Samsung phone support was absolutely useless: they don't listen a single thing you say. Even if you are tech savvy, they just take you as the standard moron and repeat advices that have nothing to do with the issues.Samsung TVs are generally great, I bought a 46 and a 32 that gave me full satisfaction, but avoid this one.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love This Little TV", "Author": "AJ", "ReviewID": "R1JWP9CP3VSF78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this TV because I liked the 40 inch version I bought for my living room.  This things is great.  Has all the inputs I need to run xbox, cable, and computer.  I will say the only annoying thing is these touchscreen buttons on the front have THE WORST contrast in the dark and the remote they give you doesn't have backlighting.  Kind of annoying that they couldn't take such a great product the extra mile to perfect.  But I primarily use this to game at my desk and I think it is a perfect size.  Another drawback is I use this and the 40 inch in the same room and the power button controls both (if thats the biggest of my problems I think I'm doing alright).  Picture quality is great sound can get pretty loud however I use gaming headphones.  Definitely would recommend for desktop gamers, dorm rooms, and kitchens.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great small tv", "Author": "Matthew", "ReviewID": "RLY2O21BA3ISG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for a week so far and it's excellent.  I'm using it in my living room for now but it will eventually find it's way into my bedroom.  For my medium- to large-sized living room the TV is definitely small but it makes do for now.  Sound is an issue in a larger room, as the volume is jacked up the sound gets tinny.  I don't think this will be a problem at all when I put it in my bedroom as it works well at lower levels.  At $160 this TV was a steal, I would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for small spaces", "Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "R1OA5IBPODXDN5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV because the screen size and slim design are a perfect fit for my dorm room.The TV has beautiful picture quality, my friends have even commented on how crystal clear it is whole watching various Blu-ray movies. Quality on HD cable channels is also great, and quality on non-hd channels is decent as well. Some other HD TVs of this size don't have nearly as good of picture quality, especially for non-HD channels which often get distorted on similar TVs.The sound quality is also great, although for some movies I have found it to be a bit quiet, but that could be just a personal preferene.Overall, I really like the TV and have not had any issues with it for the past months that I have owned it.

No picture, no audio.Samsung online support (via chat) suggested that I need to fill out a service request after attempting to troubleshoot what was wrong. They said I would not be able to return it to the reseller and that I would be forced to pay shipping to have it repaired, even under warranty (Amazon in this case).So, I can't speak to the quality of the picture or sound. Buyer beware.(For those of you who are interested, Amazon did accept the return without hassle and quickly shipped out a new TV. I stand by my original warning however, as the TV was DOA out of the box. This review is about the TV and the service provided by Samsung, not about Amazon.

Even though this has \"component\" inputs, to get the best performance, you need to use the HDMI cabling from your DVD player.This is for three reasons;1.  The video resolution on HDMI (1280x720) is much higher than on the component (720x480).2.  The audio volume on the component does not have the dynamic range to bring some DVD players up to a reasonable volume. The HDMI input does. The volume at 30% on HDMI is louder than 100% on component.3.  The component video input does not have high enough dynamic gain range to bring the video up to a reasonable brightness.As stated above, I do not watch on the air TV and cannot comment on the technical qualty of reception, only on the intellect of anyone who would watch on the air TV, but the naughty word filter on amazon would not let the accurate descriptive words appear in this review.
