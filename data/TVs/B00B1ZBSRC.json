{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Deal", "Author": "AfflictedEdge", "ReviewID": "R2ZF9I0WZA2JO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I chose super saver shipping and still received this bad-boy in one business day.  That's impressive.  I see what amazon is trying to do to beat the competition online.  And they are doing a great job in this respect.  I bought this TV for 529.00.  TV retail is around 800.00.  Got the TV setup and tuned to my liking and I can honestly say I would have payed 800.00.  The edge lit led Picture is above average, I'd give it a 8 out of 10.  Not a lot of noticeable light bleed on the corners or on the screen when just a black screen is present.  Very little in fact.  And the back-lighting is very even (not blotchy) for an edge lit led TV.  Set it up right and colors are true and vivid and the picture very clear/detailed.  Very easy to setup and adjust.  Now this TV is 120Hz.  Which isn't bad, not the best for sports but one thing I do like, is when this TV picture (smoothing) technology is engaged, there are no hovering artifacts around fast moving objects within the picture.  Which a lot of LCD/LED TV's have at a refresh rate of 120 to 240Hz with their picture smoothing technologies engaged.  I rate the sound on this TV 10 out of 10 for being a slim led HDTV at this price range.  The speakers are forward facing and sound great.  Engage the XinemaSound 3D acoustic and post processing technology for best sound.  Living in an apartment, with this TV I have no need or want for a soundbar or surround sound.  This TV's sound is plenty.  Enough bass and overall again, the sound for this price range of TV is awesome.  The TV stand was easy to put together and is sturdy.  Everything is easy to get to and use on the TV.  The remote is boring but works well and serves it's purpose.  This TV has no smart features, wifi,browsers, streaming apps, ect ect and only two HDMI ports.  I wish it had one more HDMI port but I could care less about the over stuff you pay hundreds more for on \"smart HDTV's\".  Overall if I had bought the TV for 800 I'd rate it 8.5 out of 10.  For the price I paid, 9.5 out of 10.  Great buy here on Amazon.I'm going to go the extra mile and post Calibration settings that work well with this TV.  With a few adjustments, you can calibrate the JVC BlackCrystal JLE47BC3500 to match HDTV industry standards as I did. Beneath this section is a table showing the factory settings and my calibration using several standardized tests provided by DisplayMate software.Setting  Default/ CalibratedBacklight 80/ 100Contrast 50/ 42Brightness 50/ 50Color  60/ 46Tint  0/ 0Sharpness 10/ 5Color Temp.  Natural/ CoolNow peoples eyes are different.  So you will need to adjust to what you like.  These settings should be a great start though.  Now when it comes to the Dynamic Contrast and Vivid color systems on this JVC, that is also your preference.  My advice, is to have these either turned off completely, or set to a low to medium setting.  Anything above that and yes colors pop, but look over done and unnatural.  I hope my review helped!  This is an awesome TV for the price.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thank you Amazon!", "Author": "D. Rice \"Woodworker\"", "ReviewID": "R2NAYWNFKHMJ2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first seen this TV last year around thanksgiving on a \"shopping channel\" for 699.95 with six \"easy payments\". I debated back and forth about making the purchase and waited too long as the shopping channel took away one of the easy payments and raised the price, and was charging almost 30 dollars extra to ship. So I decided to dig my heels in and wait for them to put it on sale again around Christmas, well it never happened, New Years, price never moved. Then last week I am cruising Amazon.com and I find the EXACT TV on sale for 529.00 and free shipping (Super Bowl sale). I couldn't pull the CC out of my wallet fast enough and placed the order, and within 24 hours UPS is arriving at my door with the TV! Did I say I checked the free super saver shipping and it still arrived at my house in one day! The TV is perfect, sound quality and color are great, the only thing I found weird was when setting the TV up and adjusting color and other settings to my liking I found the volume would be great while watching something but as soon as it went to commercial the volume would blow you off the couch. This TV has an audio channel where you can use the factory presets or make adjustments, I tried everything but the volume when going to commercial was very loud. For some reason JVC put some other AUDIO controls under the picture setting controls and its under a sub-button called \"advanced picture\" click on it and you will find a button for Noise reduction and you can set it low-med -high. Set it to high and it will control the very large difference in volume between TV shows and commercials. Go figure. Other than that this is a really nice TV at a really nice price and free shipping to boot.

In our area there are only a couple stores to go to.  There is a lot of choices on-line and you can spend a lot of money.  We wanted a simple but nice T.V.  We watch T.V. occasionally and mainly taped shows, movies, and sports.  We didn't want a Smart T.V. because we didn't want to battle with the kids about turning the T.V. into a play station.  They have already figured out how to plug the lap top into the T.V. if they want a bigger screen than the computer for games but they have only done that a couple times.  The biggest feature for us was the fact it has a soundbar built into the front.  My husband needed to turn off the 3D option to make the lower volume clear.  After he did this the T.V. sounds great.

It would be awesome if Amazon had a monthly billing program for larger purchases, but the price was so afordable and an absolute deal that I could not refuse.

It was so easy setting it up and putting it to the test.  I have HD so I'm satisfied with the picture quality but having some issues with the sound.  One of the main features is the Xinema sound.  I was watching the news and one of the anchor people's voice was booming, clear and just perfect.  It cut to the other anchor and the sound was drastically lower with the levels fluctuating.  Last night I was watching Miracle, the 1980 Olympic hockey movie.  I was watching the final scene and the crowd noise was perfect but the dialogue was, again, lower and fluctuating.  I've been playing with the sound and when I turn off the Xinema the sound is fine but drastically different.  I want to utilize this purchase to it's fullest potential but am getting frustrated with the sound.  I checked the speakers individually to make sure they both work as you can play with the LR Balance. They work individually fine as I was worried one may have been damaged or bib-functional.  The sound is fine in most programs but where there is multiple sounds going (e.g. crowd noise with dialogue etc) the sound mixture is off.  Any insight or pointers would be awesome and super helpful.

Did days of research.  This TV was made by Amtran Video of Taiwan under License of JVC.  These are the same people that make the Vizio TV.  I have had a Vizio for 6 years now and it works fine.  The JVC is an upgrade from the Vizio.  I do not expect this TV to have a picture as good as one that costs double.  I needed a set that was a major label, well made, and has a good picture.  I will not buy a brand X item, unless it is a single digit cost.  This is a great TV for the price.  It also has an output jack that allowed me to plug it into my old analog stereo and most big screen TVs only have the digital output plug which means buying an expensive sound bar.  Buying a $3 cable gave me great sound.  Also, the sound from the TV is quite good, surprisingly good, better than I have heard from most large screen TVs without the add-on sound bar ($$$).I should explain that we do not watch broadcast TV, but only watch movies, both DVD and Blue-ray.  I took the TV out of the box, put on the base, plugged in the TV (with surge protector) and the DVD player, and it works great.  Again, I am not expecting it to be as good as one that costs double or more.  I think that the picture is great and it cost only a little more than the brand X.

To start with I didn't want 3D or too many bells and whistles.  The TV was very easy to set up and integrate with my sound system and my new Blu-ray from Sony.  Fast and easy installation.  The picture quality is excellent.  When viewing football games in high-definition and the surround sound, it's as close to being there as possible - have not noticed any issues with blurring.  Not being a 'gamer', the number of HDMI ports is not an issue.  At some point in the future we will go bigger in the family room, but for the time being this is a huge improvement over the 31\" CRT.

I would have given the review 4 stars based on that awesome price, but I want to review against what the actual price point (currently $529) is. My first unit appeared to be an open box, but was promptly replaced the very next day by Amazon.I'm no videophile, so I wouldn't necessarily be able to distinguish good vs. bad quality unless seeing this one side by side with other sets. For the price, though, I took that chance. I will say that I can see patches of \"light leakage\" sometimes on black screens under certain lighting conditions - I read that this is normal with most LEDs though, and it doesn't interrupt the viewing of most shows and movies. I can't really judge the TV watching experience accurately, as I live in a fairly rural area and only get 4 HD channels - 3 1080i, and 1 720i that can sometimes be choppy due to signal strength (I don't have cable, so I use an antenna).When a TV show is actually coming in clearly, or watching a DVD/Blu-Ray, or playing a PS3 game, this video delivers a good picture (again, not a videophile). The thing that really turned me on to how good it was, was watching the intro to Gran Turismo 5 on it. I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed racing games until then - beautiful picture.The sound is also very good for a TV, but I still use a set of surround speakers for most movies and gameplay.I've found the remote, of all things, to be very irritating - you have to point it exactly in the right place for it to work properly.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too glare/screen reflection, blur, too red , unclear clear picture.", "Author": "y2g", "ReviewID": "R2ML11FZW7UBAK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv last week from Amazon but I am not happy with the picture quality.

But I was really surprised to see poor picture quality compare to 60HZ tv. This JVC JLE47BC3500 47\" 120HZ model has more motion blur than 42\" 60HZ tv. Another big problem is glossy screen.

What do all the positive reviewers here see?", "Author": "Allen Jackson", "ReviewID": "RDG4943B9X6J8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As a HAPPY owner of a 1998 JVC 32\" tube-type TV, I had SO looked forward to seeing this one.  High definition now!  I relied on the 100% positive reviews of this TV here-- and how wrong I was to do that.Well, was I disappointed.  These other reviewers acting like it's perfect or a perfect value . . . have these people ever SEEN a beautiful HD TV picture?  Ever?  I had titled my review with \"Mediocre\", then had to be honest and go back and change it to \"Bad.\"First of all, this JVC wasn't shipped by Amazon for 5 days and arrived on the 6th, using Free Super Saver shipping; no \"next-day\" service here.  But I'm not complaining about THAT.When this TV came, and I set it up, the picture was BAD.  VERY SOFT focus (hi def--my behind!), and I called my cable company to make sure my HD box was calibrated to the full 1080i.  Then I called JVC for technical help, though I am quite proficient technically with TVs.  I made sure to watch only 1080i broadcasts (full Hi-Def), and they were TERRIBLE.  Again, soft focus, and like Vizeos, tending toward brown/green/yellow--just an ugly picture.  Blu-rays looked like crap, too.Value?  Uh, at this price, yes, well, you get . . . a 47\" TV with good sound.  Yes, very good surround sound with ample volume, unlike many HD TVs.  But the picture is the WORST on the market.  And I had wanted a great picture, with vivid colors and excellent fleshtones, as was the case with my old, 1998 JVC tube model (which still works great today).  Of course, these HD sets are a whole new ball game vs. those, and what's more, yesterday's manufacturer of JVC is not today's (as is the case with most brands).  Brand-loyalty from years ago is irrelevant today with HD TVs.The remote control is decent, but cheap.  O.k., fine.  The OUTER BOX is brown, NO color at all, no photos, unlike boxes for the competition.  But o.k., fine, we're not buying it for the box.  This TV arrived with ALL the screws on the back of the set and on the bottom of the stand slightly loose; I could have tightened all of them slightly, but decided to leave them alone.I already have (as of three weeks ago) an AMAZING Toshiba (Toshiba 50L5200U 50-Inch LED TV, also sold on Amazon), and whether you buy the 50\" or (the identical) 46\" model of that ($649 and $499 at Costco, respectively), you're getting an unmatched value and the BEST picture of all brands--including the \"great\" Samsung--a picture that is infinitely sharper, more realistic, more \"luxurious\"-looking than on this JVC.  It blows the JVC away.  Different leagues, truly. (And the Toshiba had previously been hooked up in the same room to the same cable box as I later hooked up this new JVC to.)As someone who loves his other (1998) JVC TV and had lots of best-in-class JVC VCRs over the years, I have to say that this JVC TV has the worst picture among HD TVs that I've ever seen.  And I checked, for many hours, these brands: Toshiba, Samsung, Sony (1 model), Vizeo (which they really push as \"best\" at several Costcos), LG, Phillips, and JVC.I returned the JVC TV the day after I received it and set it up.  Yuck.There WAS, at some Costco stores, a 47\" JVC (LCD, 60 Hz) for something like $440 that DID have a nice picture--much nicer than this thinner, LED JVC.  It wasn't the best, but was at least average for an HD TV, maybe above average.If you want a great picture and you have LOOKED IN PERSON at other brands, you'll never like THIS JVC LED being reviewed here in comparison to those.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Slim design with edge LED backlit\nXinemaSound 3D acoustic and post processing technology\nBrilliant image quality with 120Hz Crystal Motion & Crystal Color  processing\nSmart brightness control with ambient light sensor", "Name": "JVC JLE47BC3500 47-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED HDTV (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Bxf-W2CyL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B1ZBSRC"}}
