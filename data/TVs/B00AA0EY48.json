{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent tv for the entertainment experience", "Author": "Rambo", "ReviewID": "R3FG7BE19SXEYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is a 2009 model. It looks like I'm so far the only one to write a review about it on here. It was a popular model up for grab during Black Friday back in 2009 at WalMart stores nationwide.I purchased this TV (on eBay) because I wanted a bigger size. I owned a 40\" Sony KDL40BX421 (which is a 2011 model). But since I watch a lot of movies and play games, I wanted the full entertainment experience on a larger screen,something that would mimic the movie theater experience. 46\" seemed right for the basement where my entertainment center is located. I still, however, wanted to stay within the plain LCD family (as opposed to other classes like Google TV, Internet TV, 3Ds, etc.), because I already own devices that would make the unit smart (Playstation 3 and Roku).This TV is not disappointing me (I've had it for two days). As I like to say in many of my reviews, I'm not a videophile, so excessive attention to picture quality is not my focus here. That said, the picture on this unit is nonetheless very good. If you play a movie from a Blu Ray or DVD source, you will be happy with what you see (I watched the first \"Lord of the Rings\" DVD and it was spectacular). Even video feedback from sources like Netflix are really clear. For example, I watched \"Cop Hater,\" a 1958 movie that is in black and white and it was a true cinema experience (keep in mind that I also own a home theater, Sony BRAVIA DAV-DZ170 Home Theater System for a better sound. If you're going to buy an HDTV of any kind, you might as well invest in either a home theater or at least a sound bar). This unit has three HDMI ports where you can connect your other devices for a better picture and sound quality. In my case, I connected both my Roku player and my home theater. I'm really happy with the size of the unit. I know there are even bigger sizes in the market but this is perfect for me. There are also better sets out there (especially newer models). Samsung's name has been synonym of quality for the past few years and Sony has been struggling in its electronics division. But with me being highly satisfied with this unit, Sony definitely remains my number one choice for electronics.
