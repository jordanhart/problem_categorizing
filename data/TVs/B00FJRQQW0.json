{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV if you find a hot deal", "Author": "Billy Bob", "ReviewID": "R15J9S59ZNWCD6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this on Black Friday for a smoking deal. Hooked it up the day I received it and it worked great right out of the box. Easily mounted to my Cheetah Mount that I purchased for it. The color out of the box seemed a bit off for my taste, but it wasn't too bad. After adjusting the color in the settings, it's a lot better. I also use it as a computer monitor and it seems fine but it doesn't look as good as it does when watching movies/TV (this is the only time I've ever used a TV as a monitor though, so that may always be the case). Speakers are about what you would expect for a low end unit...not great, but not terrible. I use it in my bedroom, so I haven't cranked up the sound that much anyways.Pros: Very easy to set up. The stand took two screws that were very easy to install. Mounting it to the wall the next day was also very easy. Inputs are in convenient locations for wall mounting and the panel itself is very thin and light.Cons: there's no buttons on the panel except a power button...everything else has to be done by remote. Seems a bit slow to turn on compared to other LED TVs that I've used, but it's not terrible. Inputs are limited (only 2 HDMI), but it gets the job done.Other: Neither a pro nor con, but the TV that I received is flat on the bottom edge (unlike what's shown in the photo that has a little bump down area around the brand name). The color is also a gloss black (unlike the brushed looking black in the photo). See my attached photo for what it really looks like in the area of the brand logo. Even the Westinghouse website has a picture of a different looking TV. Also, if you search around the internet for this model number, you'll find various places that list it as 120Hz which is incorrect. Also, the manual lists that 1280x1024 is a supported resolution, but this is also incorrect. When I set it to that resolution on my computer, the screen said unsupported mode. Another strange thing is that there isn't really a power indicator light that's visible. There's a hole under the logo where the power button is with what looks like an LED in there, but I only see red shining inside of the panel...you can't see it shining out of the hole. Not sure if it's supposed to be like that or not. Doesn't bother me...just seems strange.Bottom line: I paid less than $200 and it's an outstanding deal at that price. I'd purchase it again if I could go back in time.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Balancing Cost and Options", "Author": "Alex S. \"Alexander S.\"", "ReviewID": "R306F0PO7UH77P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV has a lot of limits. You can't turn off the speakers. If you use the speaker out jack, the USB PORT DOES power your USB speaker but you have no way of controlling the volume. Simply, the TV has no variable sound control. It also lacks any Hi-DEF component cable inputs and houses only two HDMI inputs hence the reason for the cheap price. Antenna signal receiving High-Def local channels look good but nothing like a Samsung or other high end TV's. A jump to name brand TV is like $100 more. A 37\" Panasonic is $250 at Costco. I look at this purchase as buying time and waiting for prices to plummet again when 4k's hit the market in full force next year. If you are using it in a dorm, office, kids, condo rental or small bedroom, you saved 52 dollars over the recent better $250 value at Kmart with more features (using Mr. Rebate's 4% and 5% Visa or Discover rebate). It is very difficult tuning the colors on this TV. Hopefully, someone will list the settings on one of the TV forums. Lastly, the $1 universal remote at the Dollar Store is better made compared to the remote Westinghouse gives you with this TV. I got it for under $200 and it is going into my office. I did however, buy the SquareTrade warranty and recommend the same to anyone buying this brand.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware", "Author": "James Fenton", "ReviewID": "R3TVV685628SYE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this set through Sears.com. It was fine for the first evening. It would not turn on the next morning. The included material indicated not to contact the seller but to call Westinghouse customer service if there was a problem. The Westinghouse person when told I had a problem with one of their TVs asked for the model number. I started to give it and by the time I got to the second digit she filled in the rest. She indicated that there were known issues with this set and that they could not help me but I should go to the seller of record. When I entered the \"return\" info on the sears.com web page during the process I was told that they can not accept returns of this model. When I did reach Scott at Sears he did facilitate a return to my local store. After I  made the inital order I suggested to my son in law that this looked like a good choice for him. Thank goodness that like most sons in law he ignored me. But I now feel honor bound to give you all the advice I just gave to him - ignore me if you like - Do not consider this set! Do not consider any Westinghouse set! and most importantly remember what I temporarily forgot  - Buy your product from Amazon. If I had I would not have wasted my time and effort in getting a satisfactory resolution to my problem. Jeff- I am sorry, it won't happen again.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "39\" LED TV from Westinghouse offers a large viewing area\nslim bezel design and dynamic 100,000:1 contrast ratio\nEnergy Star and meets Federal energy efficiency standards.", "Name": "Westinghouse - 39\" Class LED-1080p 120Hz Backlight Scanning HDTV-UW39T7HW", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413NcRyavVL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FJRQQW0"}}
