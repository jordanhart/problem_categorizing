I would be surprised if I have used it a total of 20 hours. The picture suddenly faded and went black ...now all I get is sound. Anyone want to buy a 19\" radio?

My 4 year old Dynex has been having issues with the sound for the last several days. Turn it on, no sound, unplug, shake, do a little dance... you name it... and EVENTUALLY you could get sound again, but once you turned it off and back on again... no sound. So enough was enough and I bought a brand spanking new Samsung (which on the Best Buy website was very well rated). Got it home probably about 10 hours ago, hooked it up, set it up, tested it for about 10 minutes and left it off. I headed to bed several hours later, popped the tv on to laze around waiting to get sleepy and suddenly the picture went black, I changed channels thinking it must be the cable, but no, it was black on every channel.I got up, unplugged it, unplugged the coax cable (which goes directly into the wall, not through a cable box) and hooked it back up. The picture comes on for a split second and then goes dark, so dark that it looks black, but at certain angles you can actually see a VERY faint image. Frustrating. I did a quick google search on samsung and sound without picture and voila! Apparently this is a somewhat common issue with the brand. A few people were able to get it to go away by unplugging the tv from power for 24 hours (not so handy) only for it to return weeks or months later. Tomorrow I get to bring it back and switch it out for something else. On the bright side, I'm just a few HOURS into ownership and well within my 30 days. On the downside... they just don't make 'em like they used to. I suppose I could have both tvs set up... one for sound and one for picture! Ha!Anyhow, would I recommend this tv? I don't think so. The picture WAS good for the full hour it worked, sharp as glass. The audio is ok (it is quite a small set), but after my very brief stint with it and then seeing that this issue is easily found with a quick google search I think I'll try another brand.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, Nice design!", "Author": "kiddrule \"kiddrule\"", "ReviewID": "R3DK09RK6JC6M7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good TV.
