{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An In-depth review about Seiki's 32 inch LED tv", "Author": "pennywyze", "ReviewID": "RYX5W4VAKX2SE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Where to begin...where to begin? Well, I won't bore the readers with a story; but here's a little background info about this TV.This Black Friday, I had a choice between standing in line at Walmart and waiting for a 98 dollar Funai or being smarter and getting a 98 dollar Seiki TV on Amazon. The reason why I went with Seiki is because I have yet to run across a review for a Funai TV; and secondly, I've actually seen the Funai in action via a family member that got one. While the Funai wasn't bad, it certainly lacked some of the connections and presented a less crisp image. Anyway, onto the review-TV build/Accessories-This Seiki 32 inch TV comes with a remote, 2 batteries, a stand that you'll have to screw on with a Phillips head screwdriver (which is standard), an instruction manual and a one or two page colored diagram that shows all the TV's features and connections. It could've come with an HDMI cable, but being that I own about 5 of them, it's no big deal. However, in the accessories department, an HDMI cable included would be the only thing that's missing to make the deal a little sweeter.The TV's build is a bit on the light side. In fact, the TV is extremely light and can be picked up by anyone.The stand is just alright; but I'll get into that part later.Score- 9/10Connections-This TV's connections includes 3 HDMI ports, a USB port, a Component port, VGA port, Composite/AV port, 3.5 mm audio cable (this can be used for headphones/earphones/speakers/and supporting soundbars), A Coaxial cable In port (also for soundbars) and finally, an RF cable out which would be used for antennae support.So as you can see, the Seiki gives you a lot of options for connections, however, I only wished this TV had stereo AV in ports for AV stereo AUX support with soundbars. If you have an AUX out soundbar, you'll need to get a two-way 3.5mm audio cable which are really cheap.Score- 9/10Image clarity/Options/Menu options-Ok. Here's the more important part of the review that I saved just before I list the cons of this product. The image clarity!!! This is important to me because I'm a gamer and light TV watcher, I also watch my Roku box and Youtube with apps such as Hulu Plus, Netflix, Crackle and PBS etc.The image quality for this TV is really good. In fact, I own a Vizio, Samsung, LG and a Magnavox as well as the worst of my TV's being a DYNEX (DO NOT BUY A DYNEX) and I'd have to say that the Seiki's image clarity is on par and in some ways better than my Vizio, It's somewhat on par with my LG (but I'll give the LG a slight edge in crispness)...heck, even the Samsung's quality is about on Par with it but I'd still give Samsung a slight, and I mean very slight edge. One of the problems I have with this Seiki TV is that the contrast and color are really, really good but can be a bit overbearing to the eye. In fact, how I tuned this TV was by turning the contrast and color down a load and fiddling around with the Dynamic Luminance. Here's a tip if you end up buying this TV and want a high contrast setting. Simply turn down the color and blast the contrast. In any event, it has a bright, colorful and crisp image.Initially, I was afraid that the SEIKI wouldn't hold up; but the quality is impressive, especially considering it's price and the size of the set.The menu options include Picture settings, Audio settings, Time settings, Parental Lock and a channel set up. Within these options you'll be able to fine tune the TV's color, color temperature, Noise reduction for image clarity, enhance the sound with PCM or RAW sound output with supported surround sound and equalizer settings between bass, balance and treble. It also supports French, Spanish and English audio.  There's also a built in NTSC/AIR antennae tuner, a QAM tuner, and a cable tuner with IRC and other options.The channel scan is relatively fast and lasts about 4 minutes. Yes, it does pick up DTV channels and local channels, all you need is a cheap antennae or some rabbit ears. Perhaps even a piece of wire would work as well. Currently, I have a normal antennae plugged into the RF port and it found over 40 local channels in 4 minutes. I didn't bother adjusting the antennae since I really don't watch much TV except for news, some movies (which I watch on Roku anyhow) and perhaps some sports games. Overall, it has a load of options, but it is missing some features that I would've liked. It also does have an LED backlight and luminance option.Score- 9/10Gaming/Xbox 360/Xbox One/PS3/Wii/PS2/etc-Being that I game a bit, here's the rundown with gaming.This TV does support 1080p resolution. On the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, it's pretty good. However, with consoles like the Wii, I'll have to tune the color a little and turn it almost all the way down because the color's really strong. I've tested it with PS3 and PS2. With PS2 I noticed that gaming does look a bit better especially if you have component cables (blue, green, red, white, red)and honestly, the PS3 games look amazing on it, especially at 1080p.At first I assumed since this is a 720p set, it would only upscale, but the games are actually in 1080p at 60hz, so playing games like Killzone, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Gears of War, Mario etc look really nice. The image is really crisp. With some games I'll change the video output to 720p or 1080i being that 1080p tends to pixellate some games horribly.The response time is good. I tested this online with Battlefield Bad Company 2 conquest mode and I haven't noticed any lag, again, the image is crisp, although to be honest, I may prefer the color of my Magnavox because it isn't so strong...once I tune the color or simply put it on a setting, it's just fine.Cons-The biggest con thus far with this TV is THE STAND. Let me clarify, the stand is supposed to be screwed in, which I did, however, it's slightly wobbly. Not to the point that if you bumped the TV it would wobble, but the stand's built awkward and the TV has a minor lean. Despite the minor lean, the viewing angle is excellent, so I haven't had any problems but it's still worth noting.The second con would be that the Tint option is grayed out for some reason. I'm not sure if it's grayed out because the tint adjusts based on the color temperature or if it just doesn't have a tint adjusting option, but in any event, it's just a gray option that I haven't been able to fiddle with.Finally, there's the audio. Yes, you get many options, but the sound is not good at all. It's just passable. But in comparison to my Vizio (which has excellent sound), LG and even my Magnavox, the sound is bad. It either sounds really tinny or just cheap. I found that adjusting the bass and boosting the treble really high helped a bit, but overall, it still sounds terrible, especially during some commercials or when listening to music. Do yourself a favor and get some speakers or a soundbar. I highly recommend soundbars by Haier or RCA.Overall-I highly recommend this TV for anyone on a budget who'd like a quality TV with a crisp image. While certain cons such as this TV having one of the worst screw-in stands, a lack of tint customization and the TV's audio which sounds really cheap even when tuned nay bug some, the overall image clarity and the viewing angle of this TV is fantastic. It has really vivid colors and again, produces a crisp image. It's not bad to view TV on or watch Roku/Apple/apps, it's great for gaming and it's lightweight. This was a steal for Black Friday, but I could see myself buying this tv full price. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the stand and the audio. If it were possible, I'd give it a 4.5/5 but Amazon doesn't have half point increments.Edit (December 8th, 2013)I also neglected to mention the following features of this Seiki TV. This TV features a memory store for color/audio and picture settings on each source chosen. In other words, If I picked HDMI 1 and set the color, then chose TV and set the color, then chose HDMI 2 or component or AV, it will memorize all color settings for each source chosen.I have finally resolved the \"Tint\" issue with this TV and it's a little weird. First, you'll have to go to factory settings by pressing \"Menu\" and then hitting \"0\" four times. (then look for \"Others\" then select \"Color Temp\" and adjust IF YOU WANT TO. To exit this mode, simply press exit or menu twice. I am not telling anyone to go to the factory menu) Keep in mind that when entering this menu, you DO NOT WANT TO MESS WITH ANY SETTING THAT YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH. (I accidentally enabled \"Burning mode\" and got a screen full of colors until I held down the power button on the TV for 10-20 seconds and pressed it again to get it off)Anyway, from the factory menu, there are settings to add \"Green\" \"Red\" and \"Blue\" or to \"offset\" Green, Red and Blue, and what I did was slowly add small amounts of Green and red to even out the tint.The downside to doing this is that it will save it to one of the color picture presets and you'll have to keep the preset in mind. I personally used this for the \"Cool\" temperature setting in picture settings just to knock the reds back a tad. (But again, that's just me)The good part about the factory menu is, there's also settings for the \"Backlight\" which I've put all the way up to 100. There are settings to enable QAM as well. But I just wanted to speak on the QAM being enabled through the factory menu a second because I saw other recent reviews that are a little misleading. If you enable QAM, indeed, you'll get a few more channels, but don't expect every cable channel possible. For the antennae channel scan, at best you may get 10 or more extra channels. (at the moment, my tuner found 58 channels via antenna with QAM enabled, whereas, before, it found about 40 or so channels. It's a difference, but it's not a huge difference)Also, there is an option available to scan cable channels, which I'm assuming works, but you'll have to give Seiki an e-mail (which is provided if you call their customer service line. In fact, it's an automated message and it's literally the first thing they talk about before connecting a call), I got my code via e-mail in about a minute flat. (It seems to be an automated e-mail anyway)I also resolved the TV stand issue by simply and carefully tightening the stand screws, and it wobbles a lot less.Anyway, I still stand by my review.

First one I received had a bad pixel but Amazon sent a new one to me really quick - be sure to check for stuck / dead pixels on your unit after initial setup.Once I received the 2nd unit, I hung it on the wall rather easily as the TV is so light. Then I hooked it up to the cable coax, I was off and running. The picture was not so great and I wasn't getting high def channels. After a bit of googling, I found that the tuner necessary to get high def channels without a cable box comes disabled on this TV. After enabling the tuner it makes a giant difference. The TV goes from kind of washed out to looking great. (see below for directions)As far as the hardware goes, the tv is light, has a small bezel and is pretty good. The remote is kind of weak and feels flimsy but it does the job.How to enable QAM using the remote:1. Press Menu button2. Press 0 four times3. Select \"Others\"4. Select \"Other settings\"5.

Contrary to other reviewers, I think the sound is more than adequate for just the TV. If you want Theater sound, you better buy an external Dolby system with Digital input. The setup is simple, just set it for Antenna or Cable and do the automatic scan. The remote control is good, except you must use the full channel number, IE:45-1, or 22-2, or it stays right where it is. There are two rounded indentations on the back that align your thumb over the Channel and Volume keys if you put your first and second fingers in them. Most of the keys are conveniently placed so it is easy to use in darkness or dim light. I tried what others said to do to enable the QAM tuner, but found no mention of one in the setup-other list. If you have Digital service, the TV is usually set to channel 3, and the channels are tuned by the digital converter that your service provides. I see no need for more than this TV provides, no set I have had was any different! If my luck holds, and I didn't get one of the 5% or so that tend to be Lemons, this TV should last ten or more years.

I've been slowly updating my parents' home over the last couple of Christmases. My sis and I got them a nice entertainment center downstairs with an AppleTV and 5.1 system for movies and such. That seemed to convince them they could handle some new tech. (Ha!) We got this TV to replace the \"cheap\" TV upstairs that they just watch broadcast TV on.For a \"dirt cheap\" option, it actually looks nice, and it's SUPER lightweight and compact. (Like, my mom can just lift it off and move it for cleaning.) It's so light that it feels cheap, but it seems surprisingly sturdy when you mess around with it. And\u2013 it's held up great for half a year so far!It did great with channel tuning, and the remote seems great (also really tiny and lightweight). The menus and interfaces aren't amazing, but they far surpass many cheap, generic TVs I've had. They're fairly intuitive and look decent (i.e. clear and easy-enough to read for my old man. ;] )We eventually got a new AppleTV for the downstairs system and moved the old one to this TV. It connected without a hitch!

The top and side few inches are as thin as my cell phone, but then the housing for all of the inputs is somewhere between an LCD, and a DLP TV, it is much less thin than a 8 year old LCD that i have, and about the same thickness as some of the newer DLP backlit TV's. Though it is extreemely light, so you know it is just empty plastic space. This could have easily been corrected with a more slim casing. (thats part of what you pay for with the name brands)The picture quality is so-so, i cant say for sure in comparison to other 720P TV's because i only have 1080P TV's to compare it to, but honestly if this is the difference between 720 and 1080, i can say for sure that 1080 is the way to go because there is a massive difference. I think that if i was using this TV as an actuall TV (im using it as a computer monitor) using it for gaming, or using it for movies i would probably return it/ not recommend it. but it is working just fine as a computer monitor, and i dont do much else on my computer besides internet and word processing, and the occasional photo editing.Pros: Very cheap price for the size, the TV has 3 HDMI inputs which is really nice, It is very lightweight. It does have standard wall mount pattern on the back and worked great with the mount i bought. The big and only A+ is the speakers, i guess thats the benefit of the large encasement, but the speakers on this are some of the best built in's i have ever heard. they sound much better than the other TV's i have owned, and though i know LED's are known for bad speakers, the others are high end TV's and dont sound this good. I have to use a sound bars with those, and with this on my computer i would be perfectly happy without having any sort of speaker or soundbar.Overall, for the price i think it is worth it, but if you want something to watch HD movies and play games on, pay a bit extra for 1080, again im not sure that even a high end TV with 720 would cut it for me now that im only used to 1080.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not waste your money.", "Author": "Barbara Hanlon", "ReviewID": "R3U5F4G0F3C53B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a 32 inch flatscreen which I bought less than a year ago.

I got the 19-inch, Model No. SE19HY10. The first one I bought had a stuck pixel, but the store took it back and gave me another one with a perfect screen. It connected easily to my Roku and DVD player and I even get a few local HD channels with a cheap basic indoor antenna with rabbit ears. I connected my Roku with an HDMI cable. My DVD player is connected with a regular AV cable, but I can also hook up it up with a composite cable, if I so choose. The rabbit ear antenna I connected with a coaxial cable. There is also an audio jack if you want to hook up an external audio device, a headphone jack so you can listen with headphones and a VGA connection so that you could use it as a computer monitor. The AV connections are located on the side of the television and the other connections are located along the bottom back. I switch between devices by pressing the \"source\" button on the remote control or the selection buttons on the top of the television.The picture is beautiful on HD movies and programs. Colors appear true and I haven't had to make any adjustments to contrast, brightness, etc. Set-up was very easy and it's small enough to fit in the limited space I have in my bedroom. The only complaint I have is that the stand is a little hard to attach and the screws quickly become stripped, so I don't recommend removing the stand once you have it firmly attached. I learned this after returning the first one to the store, because I had to take the stand back off. The stand fits on only one way, so be sure to have a good Phillips screwdriver and push it down tightly while you're screwing it in. As far as I can see, it's not wall-mountable.I can't speak to the quality of the speakers, because I use portable PC speakers connected to the speaker jack through which I listen with stereo headphones while I'm working at my crafts table. I look at the screen straight on from about 4 to 5 feet away and I haven't noticed any fade-out when changing viewing angles like I did when watching movies on my laptop. The best thing is that I can now turn my computer off and watch Internet TV on this through my Roku.

I saw the great price and decent reviews online and decided to take a risk and purchase a TV that had mixed reviews... Boy do I regret it.It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for only $50 more. Trust me, $50 extra is worth the better quality TV and not having to deal with a bad quality TV and returning that bad TV.If you want a QUALITY 32 inch TV, check this one out -----> http://amzn.to/1gYLcMs, it is here on Amazon.

When connected directly to the PC video card it works great!The USB port only seems to recognize JPG photo files and nothing else. I tried AVI, WMV, MOV, BMP, PNG, FLV, MKV...none of those files were even recognized and did not show up in the menu.The speakers are kind of crappy but so are the ones on my new and slightly expensive 47\" LG - normal for nowadays.It stands up without the included stand, but I suggest using the stand for full support.Nice to see that it uses LED lighting. My old monitor went out because the old mercury fluorescent lights burned out.3 HDMI ports was also a nice surprise.Audio INPUT is through using the 1/8\" (3.5mm) headphone jack.Audio OUTPUT has the standard two RCA Red & White connectors.Digital Audio Output SP/DIF RCA connector.VGA 15 pin for PC/Computer video.Although it is not full 1080p, the 720p size is just fine for my needs and price range.It is so much nicer to see things larger!I am not a gamer, but again, for the price, you get a pretty good & large TV/monitor.CON: If it cannot find a channel through the \"scan for channels\" function, you cannot select a channel unless it can find it first.There is a way to fine tune the advanced options and adjustments, but using the controls available I can get a great picture.The text is fairly easy to read, but the greys seem a little green when black text is not as bold. Not quite as sharp as a dedicated PC monitor, but works well enough for older eyes, and did I mention the nice larger screen? -lol.It has a energy saving mode that will shut itself off within a couple of minutes if there is no signal present, so that works well with the PC screensaver and/or power off modes. It automatically senses a signal and turns itself back on. (energy mode.)It takes about 7-8 seconds to \"boot up\" maybe not as fast as others, but \"geez, eight seconds ain't fast enough?\"Stand is cheap plastic and fairly sturdy if not violently abused.(Sure would have been nice to get this for the ninety-eight dollar black Friday price.)I paid full price, plus the extra warranty and am quite happy.If there are any dead pixels, splotchy screens, dark, etc., send it back until you get a good one.This was the first one I was sent and it's a keeper.Hope this helps!", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Clear picture", "Author": "Claudia", "ReviewID": "R24JNDVDALA5ZI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my daughter at college she says she like it and the picture is clear and very nice size.

In store, the display on these things looked BREATHTAKING. Better than most of the high end brands. So I thought, wow, what a deal! I'm not a huge cable person for my bedroom setup, mostly DVDs and retro games, and I've seen fantastic image quality on relatively cheap televisions when it came to watching films so I was sure this was exactly what I was looking for.Then it came, and, well.Setup is easy enough, I'll give it that. It's attractive. A little thick, but not horribly so. Stand was sturdy, screws went in easy.However, immediately I noticed two things:1. The quality in terms of sharpness was phenomenal for a low price TV. No complaints there.and 2. The colors, particularly on skin and hair tones, were quite desaturated.Assuming this was only the cable quality, I stuck in a DVD to find... it looked worse. Unless a scene was very highly saturated (abnormally so), skin took on an almost gray color. The contrast seemed off. I had to adjust the brightness way down, and even when I did, the black on the screen was incredibly unbalanced and actually appeared navy blue. I tried putting the colors to the 'warm' setting, and still found everything took on a blue/purple hue. I played around with it for a good 45 minutes trying to make something look good, but between fighting with the menu that was half the time, unresponsive, or jumping back to options I didn't want, and half the time appearing on it's own... I gave up. Unfortunately, it was a bad enough picture I opted to have it returned.Yes, it's a cheap television. Yes, you get what you pay for. But again, I've seen better for less, and to see such a poorly colored picture on something that looked so deceptively nice in-store was just a bummer.Maybe it was just a defective set, but who knows.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Got this for $98 on black friday via amazon lightening deals and gifted it to a friend", "Author": "David Zuckerman", "ReviewID": "R8667QKIMQDLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My friend likes it.
