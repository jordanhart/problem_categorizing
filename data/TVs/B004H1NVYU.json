{"Reviews": [{"Title": "You get exactly what you pay for!", "Author": "Gerome E.", "ReviewID": "R3V5AV7QN2T4P3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV back in late 2010.  The product looks very nice and has that modern \"feel\" to it.  All of the TV's options are touch-sensitive buttons for volume,  channel, and power.  On the side, the TV has a cable output, VGA and audio input for computers, and a headphone jack.  On the back, there is space for component/AV cables.Picture Quality:The picture quality is not the greatest, but it is exactly what you pay for.  You are still getting 1080p output, but i suggest changing the sharpness higher in a custom template.  This dramatically improved the quality, especially in gaming.Sound Quality:The sound quality is decent, but maybe the worst of any HDTV.  First of all, the sound at \"Volume 1\" is extremely low while moving it to \"Volume 2\" seems loud, especially when others are trying to sleep.  Your best bet is to find some computer speakers which will plug in easily into the headphone jacks or just wearing headphones.  Once again, the sound is just terrible.Product Design:The overall design is great!  The TV is very thin which allows more space.  One flaw about the TV is the base of the TV.  The stand constantly moves a lot and is not stable.  As long as you do not touch the TV too much, it should be fine.  While looking up other reviews, this is how every stand was made for this product.Overall, the HDTV deserves a 4 star rating for its good picture quality and its sleek design.  Although the sound may be its biggest downfall, a pair of computer speakers fixes the problem.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "bedroom TV", "Author": "Key West Dave", "ReviewID": "RNME6UJGMEKS2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I finally had to replace an old CRT in the master bedroom.

I've used it as a second computer monitor for a year now and it's been decent to me. Almost no problems, though I haven't really seen anything in 1080p on it when on TV, but I think that's because of my own TV channels not being in HD.For what it's worth, it's definitely a decent buy.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "Patty Sabella", "ReviewID": "RGMKUCYHDKHZ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Dynex tv arrived packaged in its manufacturer's box, safe and sound.

In addition, many of our customers prefer big brand names.  But the Dynex 24\" LED does a great job of accepting multiple video sources and produces an  excellent picture.  Unlike many other smaller monitors (under 32\") the Dynex speakers produce surprisingly high quality sound.

After ordering, I waited to see what would happen.  It arrived right on time, the seller was quite prompt in shipping it out. The box was sized very well to fit the product and was clearly marked \"fragile\" and \"this way up\". The top of the box was torn a bit however, despite the warning. The product was securely packaged inside and had no damage. After unpacking, I found everything promised was there, stand, remote and tv. Hooked up and plugged in and tv worked perfectly. For a small type of tv this has a a very sharp and clear picture, due to the 1080p and the led backlighting. I am quite pleased, and recommend the seller MPM Products for your needs.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Short Life - Not Worth It", "Author": "jalfonso475", "ReviewID": "R2NDNY125H47RF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I basically got what I paid for - under 2 years service out of the TV.Poor sound quality due to rear facing speakers.

The fairly sturdy and surprisingly slim design has basic needs stereo audio speakers which are understandably limited in range and volume.  They are however surprisingly capable in small to medium-sized rooms (kitchen).  There are adequate ports/connectors for most audio/video devices. Minor gripes: For rare instances when you use the front interface, the physical buttons (actually \"touch spots\" ) are incredibly difficult to see, and are oddly positioned opposite the natural direction of the navigation on the screen.  i.e.  Volume Up is on the left and Volume Down is on the right - which inclines you to press the exact opposite.  All adjustment buttons are reversed as such. Changing channels often results in a lag or delay of a few seconds - insignificant to some, intolerable to others.  Final \"entertaining\" annoyance is the range of the remote.  Despite new batteries, still limited to 10' max (direct line of site). Beyond that distance, the remote must be skillfully aimed at the sensor.  Mounting the unit higher on the wall (despite tilting appropriately) seems to exacerbate the problem.  Still recommended, if the aforementioned issues are tolerable for your intended use.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dynex 24inch", "Author": "G.
