This was given to me as a Christmas gift in 2007, bought from Walmart ($700), less than 6 months, I noticed distortion of the picture in upper left hand corner.  So, I went on the web looking for causes/problems.  Did I ever get a wake up.  Warranty not covering, I thought I will make the best of it, my problem was minor compared to others.  Well today, turned tv on, heck of a racket after a few minutes, picture is all distorted and tv shuts off.  Completely waste of money, Amazon take note of this!!!", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV But Not Made To Last", "Author": "Mississippi Mom", "ReviewID": "R1DWV3OG5IDRO6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV just over a year ago because out of about 40 televisions on display, this one had absolutely the best picture quality of anything in the store.  For picture clarity, color and display, I give this TV 5 stars.  However, after only about 9 months, we started having minor problems, such as, when the TV was turned off, the picture went off first and then the sound about 15 seconds later.  We didn't think much of it until the TV was about 11 months old and one morning it was \"stuck\".  You could watch the TV, and even change channels with the Satellite dish, but the remote didn't work and the volume couldn't be adjusted nor could you change the mode (ie. to put it into video mode to watch movies).  We brought it to a TV repair shop and they said that the \"brain\" was not working.  The part was still under warranty, but the repair shop was very reluctant to work on the ILO because they said that ILO is VERY slow at reimbursing for parts under warranty.  I spent about $85 on the repair (labor only - not too bad).  Another minor drawback is that you cannot synchronize this TV with your cable/satellite remote (so that you can just use one remote) because ILO is too new and it is not recognized by the sattelite company's remote (DirecTV).  Anyhow, it is not surprising that, in a time where cell phones and other electronic devices only last a year or two, that this is a pretty common problem.  All in all, this is a great tv if you are fortunate enough to get one that lasts.", "Date": "March 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Do not buy from this company", "Author": "Kathleen Ryan", "ReviewID": "R15YYPAWSRGJYB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from Walmart for a little over $600.00.  The TV lasted about 6 months then just stopped working.  No support from the company even though I had a dated receipt.  Basically they told me to send it back at my own expense and tough luck.  Tried to get it fixed but no repair shop will deal with this company.  Do not waste your money on this shoddy product with poor company service.", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "ilo 3200 32 Widescreen LCD HDTV Monitor w/ HDMI\"", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YAhWw9n3L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00143VUC4"}}
