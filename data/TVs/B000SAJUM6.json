{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "H. Fitzpatrick", "ReviewID": "R1BBS08KWHUKC0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is amazing! The first one I got had some issues with fine detail (particularly with single-pixel-wide sharp contrast). After some investigating I determined the set was messed up and I exchanged for a new one. The problem is gone... It looks great!I am particularly impressed with the power consumption and energy saving features that come with this TV. Make sure to adjust the \"energy saving mode,\" if you are an energy-miser like myself. I hooked the set up to a Watt-meter and got the following results:ON (displaying a basketball game):(\"energy saving mode\" @ max): 263W(\"energy saving mode\" @ half): 180W(\"energy saving mode\" @ min): 119WOFF:(quick on) 17W(norm on) 0W (resolution of meter does not show fractional Watts - so it is probably between 0W and 1W)The energy story is great, but I got the TV for the picture - which looks amazing! Halo 3 @ 1080p - looks fantastic. Watching Monday Night Football in HD makes me wonder how people watch sports in SD anymore. I'd put this JVC HDTV up against a Samsung or any other brand any day.My only complaint (other than having to return the first one) is that there is no DVI input - Hardly a problem considering it has 2 HDMI inputs. I am very happy with it.", "Date": "December 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "E.

The negatives make it useless if you like Blu Ray.It does not accept 1080p/24 sources and dsiplays them as such.  No extended color gamuts.  No 120hz, although I will admit that it does fine without it.  The blacks look purplish or burgundy - which annoyed the hell out of me.  I could not watch Star Wars or 2001 a Space Oddessy because space looked burgundy and not black!Other than those negatives, the set offered a very fine and clean picture.  The built-in tuner was more precise than on previous JVC LCD models.  The styling is hot.  JVC clearly thinks so which is why subsequent models have the same styling.I used to buy only JVC TV's as they were the best for me since 1992!  This TV turned me off and the fact that I could not find the 120hz 1080P version in store or online made it hard to buy another.  Add to that my calling JVC to ask about the WHERE to buy the 120hz versions, they could not tell me ANYTHING!  Since the clowns did not have an answer, THEY became frustrated and told me: \"If you can't find it, don't buy it!\"  Of course, what other choice would I have?  So JVC's own employees basicaly told me to get lost and don't buy from us.I put a lot of people onto JVC Tv's and made them believers.  Now they buy only JVC.  Myself, after this experience, I now buy Toshiba and I am still open to any brand.  No more JVC's however...", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great View", "Author": "Lilgoalielvr \"Lilgoalielvr\"", "ReviewID": "R35AAP10WL2AT2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband and I purchased this same TV from RC Willey and got it alot cheaper then Amazon.. (The wall mount if 1/2 price from Amazon though)The picture quality is so amazing that you really have to see it.. We do have a problem with a few of the channels not having any sound. We are trying to make contact with JVC for this issue.. We purchased a playstation 3 to use as a blue ray disk player since it was more economical for us. We really enjoy this TV and the features that it offers.", "Date": "February 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "42\" JVC HDTV", "Author": "Mr. Rodney J.
