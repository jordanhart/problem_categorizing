I wasable to get the monitor and tuner for $410.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Monitor!!", "Author": "MOD", "ReviewID": "RBAMF0F5599Q6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I also bought this LCD monitor for a cheap price ($400) because I like the way it looks.  It's a nice dark tan bezel without any visible controls at the front (i.e., minimalist look) because the controls are on the top.  Like the other reviewer stated, you should understand that this is a monitor that is HDTV-capable, only with an HDTV tuner that can be purchased separately.  I bought the ICS-SP31 HDTV tuner for another $175, so I have a beautiful Hi-Def TV for $575 all in.  Not bad.A couple of words of caution though:  If you're wall-mounting this, the KLH-W32 is not VESA compliant because it's marketed primarily for commercial use.  So you'll have to use a wall mount that's suitable for 32\" monitors without VESA mounting. Also, as I mentioned above, the only controls are at the top of the set, so you'll have to use the remote to control the set.  The biggest caution is reserved for installing the HDTV tuner (e.g., ICS-SP30/31).  Make sure you buy the HDTV tuner from someone who will support the product because proper installation of this tuner is not easy or fully-documented.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Viewing Angle: 178 Horizontal / 178 Vertical\nMaximum Resolution: 1366 x 768\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nContrast Ratio: 1300:1\nColor: Dark Silver", "Name": "Sony Bravia KLH-W32 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310wB8QNO3L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000LI412E"}}
