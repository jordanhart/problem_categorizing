Detailed info is hard to find, but it was available for store pickup so I took a chance without seeing it first since I could return it easily. I am glad I did. I cannot imagine a better picture. Observations:Container is 56-1/2\" x 40\" x 21\" with 2 hand holds on each end. Two adult males handled it without much difficulty. Comes with stand attached. Clip the bands, lift the bottomless box up and put it where you want it. I did not, but plan on 3 people to wall mount it.You are not going to get home theater audio out of any unit without a subwoofer. It is simple physics. This one sounds pretty good for what it is. You can easily connect it to a home theater system with the Digital Audio Out or RCA ports. It has no separate Subwoofer Out port.I read an article that expounded on the limitations of the human eye to distinguish contrast at any one light level. Think of waiting for your eyes to adjust to bright or dark conditions. The point made is that contrast specs are BS. Test eqpt might measure another TV as having more range than this one, but I don't think your eyes would detect a difference. This TV has good black levels and maintains them as you crank up the brightness. I still think plasma has the best picture but can't live with its shortcomings. I question the benefit of LCD LED backlight beyond reduced energy consumption and a skinnier unit. Maybe it improves black levels?If you have digital cable as a primary source, don't blame muddy dark areas on a TV. It is just excessive compression they use to save bandwidth. Sat TV is generally better. OTA broadcast is beautiful. Everything falls short of 1080P DVD. A gamma adjustment can help tweak this problem. This TV has some \"expert adjustments\" including gamma and black level. I haven't played with them, yet.One of the imaging engineers I work with gave me a chart that shows the limitations of the human eye with respect to HD. Per the chart, you have to get a lot closer than normal viewing distances to see the difference between 480, 720, or 1080 resolution. This TV is big enough that it might matter to some folks and it looks great up close. I start to see the screen door effect at about a 24\" viewing distance. Even with eagle eyes you would not see it at a comfortable viewing distance.SD content looks very good but you can't make it HD. The interpolation algorithms work well. NTSC (the old analog standard, what you get from a VCR) is 320 x 240. Standard DVD is 480P. This is an area where you could see big differences between products.TV's are moving toward becoming personal computers. I can see future units having a PDA for a remote and full capabilities. That will be cool. I can't wait. This one doesn't have any of that except a USB port for displaying pictures and playing music. It appears that computer capability is what makes a big difference in price. In my opinion, the most capable units are still pretty lame. This is the bottom of the line model but the only difference is the computer features. This TV has a PC port. Online streaming content is 480P, at best, and extremely compressed. I don't think it looks good on a big screen.Menus are well designed. This TV makes it easy to optimize to your preferences. I did not like the \"Auto\" setting for picture brightness. I wanted it brighter. Otherwise, the initial setup wizard did the job.No S-video. Seems like it is being dropped by the manufacturers.I would like to have 2 antenna inputs but the only TV I found that has two is Mitsubishi.Since broadcast frame rates are around 30 fps and interlaced only refreshes half of the lines, I think the effectiveness of 120hz (240hz)refresh rate is pretty subjective and content specific. Same goes for the 24 fps movie source stuff on DVD. This TV has settings for these features. If I find them useful, I will update this review.I could gush awhile, but I think I will watch the TV instead. When you read other reviews that gush, apply them to this one.Thanks to all of you who share your opinions and experiences with us. It helps a lot. For TV, even visiting a store will not help much because they do not optimize the picture and the store lighting is usually green.

I was going to wait until Christmas and get the best price on a large 52+ inch LCD or plasma but saw this model on sale at Worst Buy for just under @1500. Checked Amazon and they had it for $1418.19 and thought with free shipping and no sales tax, I was getting it for a super bargain.I was concerned about some consumer reviews I read. They all said the picture quality was fantastic, but there was a problem with the sync on the sound. I already had sound system hooked directly from my Comcast Digital Cable box so the sound sync problem never was an issue. In playing with the TV, I did try the speakers to hear how good they were and I wasn't very impressed. There is a sync problem when using the internal speakers so I just turned them off and will forever use my sounds system and get great sound.The picture quality is really great. I was watching a few of our favorite shows on the first night we had it, and I noticed how much more detail I could notice with this TV. My old LCD was a Sharp 46 inch and while the picture was fantastic too, the detail level that this 55 inch provides is so much better.Shipping was free and very fast. The item shipped from Phoenix and took a total of 7 days (ordered on Sat and delivered on Friday to be in my home.Just a quick follow up. I have seen that the price on this TV has dropped.....but I also have noticed that the availability of this item is also very scarce. When you factor in free shipping and no sales tax, the price I paid wasn't bad at all. Also, the home delivery and set up is a great value.I am very happy with this purchase. The low price and free shipping made this deal a super value! The only negative I can point to is the sound quality of the internal speakers and the sync problem. I read on another forum that they were able to overcome this with composite cables but I wanted the advantage of HDMI cables.Overall, super TV image, super seller, and outstanding quality for the money!One year update:I have had this TV for over one year. There picture is still perfect and haven't had one lick of trouble. I am guessing you can't buy this anymore. The LED LCDs seem to be the new trend as they command a higher price.Too bad this TV will probably last 20 years....and as long as it works, I am not buying another big TV.", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV for a very good price", "Author": "Heinz E.", "ReviewID": "R148XN201SPB83", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for a few weeks now.

I started a year ago and was pretty convinced with Samsung but glad I didn't get any of them (650, 750...series, etc.) because the reviews a year later are not so hot.  I was going to buy Walmart's Visio 55\" 120hz this week for $1398 because it looked like a great flat and the reviews weren't half bad either.  I went to Best Buy to get a surround sound (research on customer reviews was minimal for these because the flat was tiring enough, lol).  Anyway, I saw the LG 55\" 120hz for around $70 dollars more.  The only perk over the Visio was this one had 70k ratio vs. Visio's 50k.  Took it home and with the help of a friend, had the flat up and going an hour or so.  Most of my time was invested with centering and installing the support bracket on the wall.  I probably could have hung the sucker myself being it is only 70lbs but better to be safe.  I hooked up my 5.1 and Blue-ray today.  I am not hard to please as I have endured over ten years with an old tv (small tv at that, lol) from 1995 with no surround sound.  I really think it's an awesome flat.  I haven't adjusted one thing and the flat looks absolutely great.  You will want a surround system or sound bar, the sound is just good ole tv quality sound.  I will probably try some fine tuning when I get around to reading the manuals.  Anyhow, for those that are interested, I bought the Sony DAV-HDX285 Home Theatre system and the Samsung BD-P3600 Blu-ray player.  I don't like integrated units because of the possibility of one part going bad.  I bought this particular Sony BR because it has the wireless network technology...I am listening to Christmas music right now from [...] as I write this novel, lol.  I also use it for my Netflix movies.  All of the components mixed together sound just like the movie theater in my living room, of course my living room is close to the size of one, 1200 sq. ft., lol.  Anyway, I will report back here if anything goes haywire.  One last thought, I didn't buy any of those very expensive warranty packages.  The manufacture is good for one year.  I figure if your product can make it one year it will probably do well for you beyond that.  Merry Christmas all....Dave", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Almost Great HDTV", "Author": "A.

I continued to ask for a fix for the issue but he was a robot only able to answer from what he was instructed to give, which I made a comment about and he became indigent and hung up on me.I have worked on the set for awhile now and with all the individual settings and the ability to tweak those settings I finally got a beautiful picture with my satellite, blu ray, and even my DVD's, everything looks great and would be perfect if the tru-motion would work a little better.I do wish they would address this issue with the tru-motion/video noise circuitry problem.I have some commercial experience with LCD TVs in my job and understand they do have the means of helping to resolve this issue or at least able to tailor it so it's not as troublesome (low key).I know this probably won't help out a lot, but I purchased a very expensive HDMI cable which not only helped to have a better picture it helped to a smaller degree with the ghosting.Over all I'm very happy with the purchase now and if I had it to do all over again I would stick with the same set.LG really needs to work on their customer relations skills and come up with a better plan for dealing with the tru-motion issue other then apologizing for the trouble I'm having and stating it's all better when you turn it off, what's the point in having the tru-motion if it's always off?", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "warranty", "Author": "Mr. V", "ReviewID": "R3G8VHEFDMZEVH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Nice TV until the picture went out 3 months after the new warranty expired.

Here are some notes. I would have kept the 47\" led LCD if it weren't for two big glaring issues: not just flashlighting around the edges but serious defects in certain places (over-brightness) that were annoying in dark scenes. In addition, while it had seperate controls for anti-judder / anti-blur, the more you turned UP the anti-judder, the more the image would judder! WTF? In addition the 120z created horrible artifacts, even while just looking at wikipedia!I ended up settling on this one. Why? It's huge. Sure, it doesn't have all the little gadgets, and it doesn't have network support. That's ok, I'm fine with that. What I DON'T understand, is why they removed the option to play videos from USB. Now it's just jpg or mp3. Yeah, right, like I need a 55\" mp3 player or a big @ss digital picture frame. No. Ok, so I got over that. Then I started playing around the 120HZ on this set. And I THINK, I finally understand it. Here's the deal: because this technology is still really in it's infancy, you HAVE to accommodate IT, it doesn't accommodate you. Case in point, this technology basically relies on you not watching any one thing on the screen in particular, but to \"take it all in\" so that the improvements gained by 120hz OVERALL aren't judged by the minute but frequent errors in this still pretty undeveloped tech. If you use the \"high\" setting and watch regular tv, you will be amazed at how smooth fast action is and how it almost seems like it's going at 1.5x speed. You will ALSO be frustrated when you realize the tv doesn't get it 100% right all the time. LARGE judders not present when 120HZ is OFF will have you scratching your head from time to time. I think this was just the compromise they decided to make... as it is, with the setting on high GAMES look awesome and it definitely helps. I have it hooked up to my PC, and the difference that 120HZ over 60hz makes it a -must- for full-screen fast action games on a  set this size. Movies, TV shows, etc, will look superb with it off: with 120hz on you may begin to notice all too frequent \"guessed\" frames that just don't sync up with the action. Whether it's just an underpowered chip, or needing a firmware patch, or someone to get in the service menu and do some tweaks, 120hz is not for everyone and NOT for all the time.Other than that, what can I say? The picture is clear and great out of the box but of course for tweakers the picture options like all LG sets are phenomenal. That being said, like all the big lg's I've had, it doesn't sit completely level on it's stand which might have you using a shim... the control isn't back-lit which is just... retarded. It's 2010.I got this for $1200, and really, it's a pretty good deal. At $1600, I would think there are better options, but, if you just want a good barebones 55\" inch lcd, this is it.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bought it elsewhere but you still need to know about it", "Author": "M.

Contrast Ratio, 120Hz vs 240Hz, 3 vs 4 HDMI ports, I was looking for the best bang for my buck and found it in this TV.  I paid $1499.00 at a local appliance store and since Amazon now charges NYS tax there was no real deal to be had online.  Also purchased with this was a Five Year warranty for $159.00 almost $150 less than the three year plans the big appliance stores and Amazon is offering.  Considering that the company servicing all of these warranties is the same this was a no brainer.  At 55 inches it is a huge screen, just barely fitting over my fireplace mantle, but the picture it delivers is fantastic.  Plugged in the HDMI Out on my FIOS cable box and into the port on the back of the TV and TA DA, beautious 720p HD picture.  Out of the box settings were a breeze to tweek with the easy to use remote.  And while professional tuning will get you the \"best picture\" possible, you don't need to be a \"GeeK\" to get a picture you are extremely happy with.The sound is what it is... tv sound.  Not tinny like some of the thinner tv's so surround sound is not instantaneously necessary.  It's 4 inches thick, and while you can't pack much speaker in that kind of size, the back facing invisible speaker is more than adequate insomuch that it is not necessary to change the volume up and down on DVDs being played to adequately hear dialogue over the background noise and music.Out of the box the TV comes with the stand attached and fits just fine on the standard TV stand that my old 36 CRT TV was on.  This TV though, is not light.  At nearly 100lbs it takes two able bodied people to lift it and mount it onto a wall mount.  400 x 400 VESA standard mounting holes on a flat back make buying a mount rather easy and once it's there, all I can say is WOW.

The prices seemed to be unstable, and since we missed a really good deal, we kept waiting for it to happen again, especially after Christmas that year. The prices went up instead.So around Christmas 2009, we started again, but this time 55 inch LCD TVs were the big thing, and after looking at several, this LG seemed to have the best combination of features at the price point we were evaluating. I was on the edge of getting it when it was at $1479 one morning, but didn't. Later that afternoon it was $1399, less than the local price, and with no tax and free shipping with white glove delivery and setup, it was hard to beat, so I jumped on it.

I think I'm going with LG products on TV's and Blu-ray players for the foreseeable future, as the quality appears to excellent. Hopefully, they won't become like Sony and after many years let everything go to pot. I can't bring myself to buy anything Sony anymore, with all the products that I've had by them more recently that fell apart far too soon.Just a word about the delivery if bought through Amazon -- it was a wonderful experience. I was able to schedule a delivery time range, and when they brought it, they took everything out of the box, set it up, and took all the trash away, so no TV box out for trash pickup advertising to everyone what we got.

Any bigger would be just too big (and you will start seeing pixels if you get a large TV in your small living room.)Plug the TV, plug any regular rabbit ears antenna, and in no time, you may start to receive digital TV signals. I was able to pick up ABC, CBS, KPBS, and Fox channels all in High Definition just by using an old antenna. I don't watch that much TV so I'm not going to subscribe to Cable or Satellite. The channels I got are more than enough especially during prime time. I plan on renting or buying BluRay movies.I haven't purchased a BluRay player yet, but when I do, it will be the LG BD390 (because it has NetFlix, CinemaNow, etc. internet-based entertainment services (This TV model does not have it. The model LH50 TV series does.). So, I haven't really tested this TV to its full potential. The LH40 and BD390 will be a great combo!I like the EnergySaver mode. You can select presets (Min, Med, Max, Auto, etc.) on how much energy you want it to save. It will dim the picture which is perfect because at night when I dim my living room lamps, the picture is just too bright in the room. Dimming the TV using the EnergySaver modes helps with this issue.The swivel stand is very useful.If you're about 7 feet away and you have 9 guys sitting side by side in the living room, about shoulder-to-shoulder width apart from each other, The guys in the middle get the best viewing angle while guys #1 and #9 will be at a viewing disadvantage. The picture becomes dim for them, but still acceptable.There is no S-Video input in case you plan on hooking up your old S-Video devices. Waaa! It would have been nice, but not really necessary.In the first week of use, I noticed 2 dead pixels. This is a problem with any LCD (even my Samsung 24\" computer LCD monitor has a dead pixel). But it's not noticeable at all when you're 3+ feet away and watching your favorite programs. You have to be about 4+ feet away so you don't strain your eyes anyway, dummy!All in all, this is a great LCD TV.

The picture quality straight from the factory was good, but there are also quite a few adjustments available to really fine tune the picture to your own particular liking.I've read some complaints on here about a lip synch problem with the 40-series LG televisions, however from what I can gather this problem is caused by people using the wrong HDMI cable with the set.  You just need to make sure you're using an HDMI cable that's version 1.3 and category 2 certified and you shouldn't have any problems.As for the sound, I think it's actually okay for what it is: speakers within the television.  Obviously you're not going to get home theater-quality sound out of the television itself, so if you adjust your expectations accordingly you should be satisfied.  With that being said, I think anyone who's willing to shell out the amount of money it costs to get a set like this would obviously do well to also invest in an actual home theater system so you can enjoy the whole experience.Overall I'm completely satisfied with my purchase and can't wait to round out the rest of my system as soon as the PS3 is available again...", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly pleased", "Author": "Zaeolora", "ReviewID": "RDQVUI3PO8F3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a 46 or a 52 inch television, but found this one on sale.

I moved it and set it up; and I was instantly happy with the product. The only thing that still shocks me a little is the massive-ness of the TV, it is much bigger than I thought.The picture is beautiful and bright. The sound is adequate for my needs, but my movie sound goes through my home theater system. Some times the TV is a little too crisp, but I have not fiddled with the settings much yet, so I hope to tinker with the settings a little.Over all, I have had this TV about one month and am exceptionally pleased with it.

I bought Sony for my first one (Gift for my parents) and I am glad that I found this one for myself. I think that Sony, Samsung, and LG, they are neck and neck in quality wise. However, price for LG is unbeatable. Sony cannot beat this price, because they don't own LCD. They just buy LCD from LCD manufacturers (including Samsung and LG) and assemble it. Therefore, premium price for Sony is not for their quality. It is for their cost. Samsung and LG, they are both from South Korea, and they have been rival each other in South Korea for last forty years. What I mean by that? They are equal in quality wise. However, thanks to their excellant marketing stretagy, Samsung has gained much bigger reputation in US and LG is trying catch up. This is why LG offer this agressive price.

The TV looks nice, but after set-up on the swivel stand was completed, we immediately noticed the unit is not level. When facing the TV, the right side is lower (where the power indicator light is located), you can't miss it! It could be the stand that is not strong enough to carry the unit's weight.Another problem is when switching channels, the screen turns completely black, no picture for at least 15 seconds, very annoying. I use an HD cable receiver and I don't know what's causing this. I didn't experience this problem with my smaller HDTV that I used before this one. I'm considering returning it, 'just wondering how the process will go due to this unit's size (55\") and I don't know if I will ever get a full refund. I'm afraid I'll end up losing more money than saving on tax and shipping.9/6/2012 Update:Changed to 1-star since there's no option for no star. About two and a half years later, the unit died. We heard something popped inside while watching on Thursday morning, 9/6/2012. It never worked again. Customer service said the problem seems to be unrepairable.What a sad story!

As soon as the picture was up I was not happy. The colors were dull. And there is not a lot what you can do about it. Contrast ratio is bad too. I had a DVd in  and that looked afoul. Big chunks of unformed  colors. Even the Blue _ray was not clear and HD as it suppose to be. And I dont know what it was, but motion was sometimes hard to watch on tv.  Felt weird for the eyes. I do understand, that just a standard tv channels can not look that good in a huge TV, but this was not good at all. Colors and clarity are deeply off.So if you just want  a big tv without quality behind it and you are just willing to go and waste your money on that, then go ahead!We returned it and got ourselves Sony VE5 Eco.
