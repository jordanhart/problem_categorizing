It has no HD tuner, and is intended for use with HD cable tv to bring in the HD signal. It does an excellent job of that without having to worry about maintenance of the HD unit. It has a very fine picture, as good as I've seen anywhere. I purchased a 5 year warranty on the unit, and it just expired without ever being used, and with virtually -0- problems with the TV.  I just purchased a three year extension to the warranty for $400.00 & I'm happy with that too, it means I have at least another 3 years with no additional maintenance costs.  I intend to keep it for as long as it lasts.", "Date": "November 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Super beautiful HDTV if you have the room for it !", "Author": "gtippitt", "ReviewID": "R2VAGXLPC179IF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE after 18 months -I've been using this TV with a home theater PC running MythTV software for the past 18 months.  It really is a wonderful TV.  I can surf the web and email from across the room in a recliner or watch TV with really great video quality.  Adding an inexpensive used PC with a usb TV tuner lets this display really show off what it can do!..........I recently bought a SONY KP-57WS510 TV and love it.  It is a 57 inch HDTV.  It only has two major drawbacks.  The first is that it only has an analog NTSC tuner and will not tune in ATSC digital broadcast channels or cable clear QAM channels.  You must use a cable or satelite box or a digital tuner for OTA digital.  The TV is HDTV ready in that it can display 1080i or DVD 480P.  The TV's 2nd drawback is that you cannot hang it on the wall like a picture frame, because it is lots bigger than a flatpanel and weighs about 150 pounds.With a 16:9 HDTV display that is 57 inches diagonally. This is a really BIG DISPLAY.  It is 50 inches wide and 30 inches high.  For a non-flatpanel, it does not take nearly as much space in the room as I was afraid it might.  I was replacing an old 32 inch TV with picture tube.  The display of this rear projection TV is twice as wide as my old TV, but the cabinet does not stick out into the room as far as the old TV did.  The cabinet of the Sony KP-57WS510 is only 27 inches deep from wall to front of display.Before looking at this TV, I had always hated rear projection TVs, because they were fuzzy looking if you were standing less than 20 feet away.  The picture on this TV is not only huge, but sharp and crisp from only 5 to 10 feet away.  If you try to watch it from less than 7 feet away, it is somewhat tiring on your neck, because you must turn your head from left to right to see the entire picture because it is so wide.  When my old 32 inch TV died, I could not afford a new flatpanel that was as tall as my old display.  I started looking at large-used TVs that had been replaced with flatpanels (by people with more money to waste than I have).This TV rolls easily on its own wheels.  The seller and I were able to lift it onto the bed of a pickup truck.  I was able to unload the TV easily by myself at home by using some boards for a ramp to roll the TV from the back of the pickup onto my front porch and into my living room.  In less than 15 minutes after getting home with the TV in the back of a pickup truck, I was watching a DVD on the TV and in awe of its beauty.  It cost me less than the sales tax would have been when the TV was new.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still a great TV", "Author": "J. Romo", "ReviewID": "R1RZC0KB14V6HN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought our tv in 2004.  Had it shipped 300+ miles.  It needed to be fixed once while covered by warranty, and the same problem less than a year later.  The repair man fixed it mostly free of charge because he said maybe it was a bad part.  Haven't had any other problems with it.  In fact we've been patiently waiting for it to quit working so we can buy a flat screen tv!!", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "6 1/2 years, a few repairs!!!", "Author": "Kawa Jaan \"THE GAMER\"", "ReviewID": "R2H5XYZEUBCEQY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV for about 6 1/2 years. About 3 years ago, one of the convergence chips broke and had to be replaced. Then, 2 years ago, the other one went bust. The total repair cost for both was about $250.When new, we paid about $2700 for this TV. Back then, I wasn't a huge online shopper and I didn't do any comparison to see if I was getting the best TV or the best deal. Anyway, the picture quality of the TV is still pretty good. DVD Movies look sharp and clear, especially in a dark room, and the speakers produce good sound quality. My only other complaint -other than the fact that it broke twice and had to be repaired- is of the TV's remote control. It has not been easy to program the remote with various media devices; even my DVD player, which is also a Sony, cannot be controlled by this remote! Other than that, the lack of an HDMI input is also a negative. But I guess back then when this TV was made (2004), TVs didn't come with HDMI connections. However, the TV does have connections for all the Component Video and DVI devices that you can possibly have, (I have had up to 4 devices connected to it, with the S-Video, Component, DVI, etc). So, overall, this is a good, big-screen TV that produces good sound and picture and, if bought today, is very inexpensive for a 57\" TV.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "One of the best", "Author": "J.

It is used daily and often on for several hours. It's 2012 now and I still watch it. But I must advise anyone who has a rear projection tv to keep the rear vents vacuumed and dust free. Dust will accumulate inside the tv and should be cleaned every few years. This also applies to all electrical devices (pc's, vcr's, dvd players) because electrical components attract dust by laws of physics. I'm very ashamed to admit this but I did not clean inside this tv for seven years. It's amazing it did not overheat something or quit altogether. Goes to show how durable Sony made this tv. But I know better now after seeing the inside of the tv. I never imagined how dusty it could be until I removed the rear vent panel. If you have pets as I do there'll be more accumulation than normal. NOTE: if you are not comfortable doing this yourself, hire a service tech if you can. There's always risk of damaging parts or electrical shock from a capacitor or something. But I promise the cleaning will be well worth it and lengthen the tv's life.  I used a soft brush attachment on a vacuum cleaner, gently brushing and lighty touching the dust to stir it loose and into the vacuum. Spray camera lens or eyeglass lens cleaner onto a soft cloth and gently clean the three lamps. DO NOT TOUCH the large projection mirror above because it will scratch just from fingers touching it.Anyway, after assembling the panel and turning on the tv, I was absolutely amazed at the picture quality. 100% better. It was like getting a new tv. The dust had accumulated so slowly I didn't realize the picture had become that bad. As with all Sony equipment, this tv model will provide years of great service if treated carefully and kept clean. Do as the owners manual advises, ALWAYS HANDLE WITH CARE!Enjoy!", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Flash Focus Auto and Manual Convergence\n3D Digital Comb Filter\nIt also accepts 480 progressive (480p) scanning lines from compatible DVD video sources.\nBy using an impregnated cathode and a denser phosphor layer, this CRT produces a 30% tighter beam spot compared to previous models.\nHD Detailer Wideband Video Amplifier", "Name": "Sony 57\" Widescreen HDTV Monitor (KP-57WS510)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21RQXX5V2VL.jpg", "ProductID": "B0000AKMM4"}}
