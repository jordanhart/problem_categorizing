My decision to go with the Philips was based on the extra video processing enhancments that come with this TV and the \"classy\" styling of this unit. As far as the picture quality goes both units provide excellent video but the Philips just seemed to provide a more stunning picture on HDTV and DVD progressive scan. The picture adjustments that can be made to tailor the picture to how \"you\" want it to look are seemingly endless - each input can be adjusted the way you want it. One other notable thing about the philips is the picture with satelitte - This is one of the few TV's with which the satelitte picture looks even good - and when it comes down to HDTV images it is downright amazing. One thing anyone should consider when buying a RPTV is the ability of the TV to provide some sort of screen protection from phosphor aging as I found out from my research there are some Tv's out there that have only lasted 3-4 years before the black bars wear into the screen. I have found that the 4.3 format is what I am using the most to view programming from satelitte so you get the black bars on either side of the screen so the black bar burn in could be a potential problem. The Philips auto format screen sizing is also one of the best available and not many of the RPTV's I looked at even had anything auto period! - you had to use the remote to fill the screen and the resulting picture was quite unporportional. Another deciding factor with purchasing this TV was the dealer I bought it from offerd me an additional 2 years parts and labor warranty as his comment was \" We have very few problems with any of the Philips TV's we sell and that's why we offer the extra 2 years\" . On the downside , (if any) this television as with most RPTVS is the viewing angle - it is very location sensitive - you need to view it sitting down and not to far off center - I have found that about 8-12 ft out and no more than 3-6 ft off center on either side is about maximum.A highly recommemded HDTV RPTV.Mw", "Date": "April 18, 2003"}, {"Title": "Incredible Picture", "Author": "\"tmatop\"", "ReviewID": "R3NUY1FNL1PH94", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the tv for 2 weeks now and I love the picture quality especially w/HDTV signals.  Even the look of the tv is great because it doesn't look like a big square against you wall.  I only have two complaints.  1.  When watching an hdtv signal you do not have the ability to adjust the screen size (i.e. 16:9).  Some hdtv stations broadcast signals on their hdtv channel that are 4:3 ratio. 2.  It needs to have at least 2 HD Component inputs instead of one component and one RGB input.  It's difficult finding the RGB harness at an affordabe price.  This only is a problem if you are planning to watch hdtv (with hdtv receiver) and a progressive scan dvd player.  Other then these two issues, this is the best tv for the money.  Highly recommend purchasing.", "Date": "November 21, 2002"}, {"Title": "Outstanding for the price", "Author": "Evangelist Ed Hensel", "ReviewID": "R1T4MZ3XJYJULI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked at a lot of different rear projection wide screen tv's and found this to be the best.  I opened it up out of the box and it worked great.  The horizontal viewing angles are good, however virticaly it is challenaged.  The picture changes (dims) if you are standing up.  Not bad for the money.  It has awesome features and has one of the best picture qualities.  I also like the sound.

The picture quality is outstanding, especially with Progressive DVD.  The price was unbeatable for the high quality features and benefits this tv offers.  The tv offers features not often found on more expensive models.  I would suggest reading the entire manual and playing around with the remote to increase one's familiarity.

I have had it for 6 years never a days problem. But it doesnt do the true hd in 1080 like it should.  A tech came out hooked it up to Satellite and said it is probably doing 720p at best. Also you cant use the pip if you are using hd. another drawback. Color isnt the greatest hard to fine tune tint and color . Woulddnt buy another Philips nor a projection. Save your money and get a LCD cant beat them better picture.", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Out-of-box home theater--great!", "Author": "R. H.
