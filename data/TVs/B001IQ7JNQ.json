{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good value for the money. Great picture. Good Sound.", "Author": "John Brady", "ReviewID": "R2J9XO2KXCYTFS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very good television with many options for expandability. The four HDMI ports are extremely useful and made hooking up my component add ons a breeze. I attached a DISH DVR, a DVD/VCR combo, a DVD player, a Blu-Ray player, and an A/V receiver -- and it was an absolute delight to find all of them worked perfectly with the Sony. The 120hz picture makes fast action scenes a pleasure: no blur. And, the 1080p shows up as such for viewing Blu-Ray discs. There is, occasionally, visible pixeling for certain scenes -- although they are hard to describe. The sound is the one disappointment that keeps me from giving this a higher rating; to hear clearly from the television speakers, the volume must be turned up to uncomfortably high levels. Using external speakers is the only way to go with this baby. The remote control is easy to use and handles all needed actions. Setup is a breeze. This model is available at high discounts from many places. I got mine at CostCo and have not felt cheated. You will, I believe, find this model -- with most of the latest technical improvements (alas, it does not have 240hz refresh)-- to be good value for the money. My only regret is not getting the 52 inch model; it, however, is overpriced in my opinion.", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony's Bravia KDL-46WL140 W series Full HD 1080p HDTV", "Author": "G. Bojo", "ReviewID": "R3IRLTOA73J0KE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've only had this for a few days, but couldn't be more happy about our purchase. We upgraded from a 32\" Westinghouse, and the picture improvement is beyond words. Watching blu-ray had almost a 3D effect given vivid mode, 1080P, 120Hz, and our Playstation 3 which supports the 24P mode.Have watched in direct sunlight and darkened room, with no issues on visibility of the screen. I don't have the sound issues others have stated, but I only use the TV sound for the Internet broadcasts (have regular sound going through an Onkyo receiver).We attached the included Internet device not expecting much, but were pleasantly surprised by the various internet \"channels\" available. Tested the HD download from Amazon (an Ironman trailer) and it looked great. We have 15mbps FIOS, so thoughput doesn't appear to have any issues.Other channels beyond Amazon's video download (which you can link with your Bravia account for easy purchase) are CBS (with most of their TV lineups available), SI, a trailer channel, and many others (about 20 in all upon its initial search. I haven't experimented with adding anything yet, as I'm curious how hulu will work with this.Overall, a great TV at a great price from Costco. A 2 year warranty tops off the package well.", "Date": "May 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "great value for the price", "Author": "ARCHIE", "ReviewID": "R5QOAEVARMKNN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv at Sam's club on black Friday and couldn't be happier.  The price was 1348.00.  The tv came with internet hardware which I still haven't connected, I bought it to watch tv not some goof on u-tube.  The menu on the tv is very simple to use and takes no time at all to start watching your favorite shows in HD.  The picture is great along with very good sound.  If you find one buy one.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Uh oh, no more Bravo to Bravia", "Author": "loce_the_wizard \"loce_the_wizard\"", "ReviewID": "R3BV8GV471T47Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Update: About 2 months after the expiration of the extended warranty on this TV, I noticed bands of dying pixels starting to be visible on parts of the screen. The process continued, and when a large red, rectangular area just off-left of the screen's center developed, this TV had to go. Sony does not support its TVs once they have any age on them, and the repair bill would have exceeded by far the cost of replacing the TV. One has to suspect that these TVs are simply not built to last or that they contain inferior parts. The JVC CRT was still working fine when I let it go some 7 years after I bought it. Regardless, this TV is gone, a new Samsung now in its place and Sony is, for all practical purposes, just a another 4-letter word when it comes to TVs.BTW, here is my original review.For the last six weeks, we have enjoyed having Sony's Bravia KDL-46WL140 W series Full HD 1080p HDTV grace the wall of the family room, a spot previously hidden by a large wooden media cabinet that contained a 37\" JVC CRT TV. The contrast in clarity and sharpness between the two TVs is amazing, and the Sony's crystal clear picture on HD TV shows just how much technology has changed in just nine years.Before buying this model, I was looking for a flat screen with plenty of HDMI inputs (not that we need them now, but in three years, who knows?), a TV that itself was not ugly or overstated (didn't want any touches of red or other colors as I was not buying a car), and a TV that would make me stop and stare at the picture. A bit of research preceded my expedition to find the right TV (we were saving change for quite some time), and this model was the one I kept coming back to at the large consumer club where I bought it. The other TVs, all getting their feed from the same in-store source and all subject to the same harsh overhead lighting, all paled in comparison. (Plus, this was the last one in the store, showing that I was not alone in my opinion.)We installed this 46 inch on a Sanus rack, and actually our measuring was the most time-consuming part of the installation. The set up menus were easy to follow, and the we had the TV up and running in about 30 minutes. We have tried out some of the options, and after some initial tweaking in the deeper levels of the menus, have not tended to leave the settings as is. I suspect once we add a blu-ray DVD player, we will need to reexamine the options.It took a bit longer for me to figure out all the inputs and get the surround sound working through my older non-HDMI receiver, but I agree with others, that the TV's sound is a bit anemic, and the added muscle from surround sound really enhances movies and concerts.Guests have all commented on the quality of the picture and the size of the 46 inch screen. For us, this is plenty of TV, and we should be \"future proof\" for a few years yet. I have not yet hooked up the Internet component (though it is installed) but plan to run an ethernet cable directly from a router to the TV in the next few weeks.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent, still very happy a year and a half later", "Author": "Didier Juges", "ReviewID": "R1XWSGF9RPB2M9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought I would write a review now even though I bought the TV on black Friday 2008, a year and a half ago. I think it may be of interest to others to know how I feel about this Sony KDL-46WL140 LCD TV after long term usage.In one word, EXCELLENT, 100% positive. In the time I have owned it, this LCD TV set has given me many hours of most enjoyable experience, with a variety of programs including live sport on cable HD programming (NBA, tennis, soccer, football mostly) to Blu-Ray movies (latest one was Avatar, which looks absolutely stunning on this set) to video games. I have never come across a situation where I could fault the Bravia for anything. My children play games (I don't) on the Wii and the XBox 360, and they appreciate the very fast refresh and absence of blur, judder or ghosting.My only not completely positive comments go to the zoom feature when viewing non-HD cable TV programming. The zoom pre-sets do not always allow to adjust the picture size the way I would like, when viewing non-HD programming (programs that do not come natively in the 16:9 aspect ratio of the screen). When viewing HD programming, it is perfect without needing adjustment of course. Please note that this issue is not unique to the Bravia, I have not found one TV that gave me the type of flexibility I wanted for regular (old style NTSC TV programs), so do not use that comment as an excuse for not getting this set.Also, the sound could use a little more bass, but there again, most TV's built-in speakers have the same issue, they are simply too small for good bass. Other than the lack of deep bass, the speakers sound really good and natural. I do not agree with another reviewer's comment that the sound has to be cranked up. Most of the time, my sound level is set around 30, I never had to go above 50 (out of 100 full scale). The TV has 22W real watts of audio power and that is plenty in my very large living room.I like being able to rename the inputs to something more useful than the defaults, but you can only choose from a relatively wide selection of presets (such as \"Game\", \"BD\", \"Cable box\" and such), you cannot not make up your own names.I like also being able to control the TV from the Sony BD player's remote (a Sony BDP-BX1). However, the TV remote does not control the BD player, even though it has buttons intended for that purpose. The remote is not a universal type.The TV has plenty of inputs and works extremely well as a monitor for my laptop, which I use to watch Hulu or other video programming, and occasionally for web browsing.Finally, this TV looks good even when turned off. It has great style.I know today you can buy TCD TVs that are thinner, but this one is fine as it is (4.5\"), and a thinner TV is likely to have even less bass because there will be less space for the speakers, so before you fall for the \"thinner is better\" sales pitch, make sure you need it.In summary, if I had to buy a 46\" LCD TV again, I would definitely get it again. You can get a refurbished one for about $800 and that's a terrific deal in my opinion.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Display Resolution: 1920 x 1080\nInputs/Outputs: Analog Audio Input(s): 5\nAudio: Audio Power Output: 22W\nSpecial Features: Channel Skip/Add, Favorite Channel\nIncluded: Remote Control", "Name": "(Refurbished) Sony Bravia 46\" 120Hz Motionflow 1080P LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21y72-%2BRiOL.jpg", "ProductID": "B001IQ7JNQ"}}
