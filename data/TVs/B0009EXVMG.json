You need this TV!", "Author": "Lloyd Ronick \"Gadget Nut\"", "ReviewID": "R6HQE7WVJ89HS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like the previous review says, your jaw will drop. The picture on this TV is clear, bright and lifelike, and the images are eye-popping. DVD's are amazing, even in 480P. I'm using the DirecTV HD TiVo as my satellite source, and an over-the-air antenna for local HD channels. DirecTV's HD choices are limited, but the picture on those (compressed) channels is beautiful. But the piece-de-resistance is the non-compressed local HDTV broadcasts. Just amazing. Our local CBS affiliate does their news in HD, and it makes the boring local news riveting just for the picture. Getting strong signals from an antenna can be challenging, but it's worth it if you can do it.The set has more options than you'll ever need, but I particularly like the surround-sound simulation mode that plays a simulated 5.1 image over the set's 2 speakers. It actually creates sounds that seems to come from behind you. Of course, you can hook it up to your home theater for the real thing (over an optical connection).I have noticed no rainbow effects that some say appear on DLP's, and the picture is plenty bright, even in my room that has a wall of windows behind me and skylights above me.In short, if you can afford this TV, you shouldn't hestitate to buy it. Amazon has a great sale on it now (July 2005), so it's even less painful. Besides, amortize it over the 10-15 years you'll enjoy this TV, and it's a bargain.", "Date": "July 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "The Lag problem is fixed for video gamers", "Author": "C.

This will reduce \"lag\".  You cannot use the S-video or the Composite inputs...if you do you will experience lag.For new TV's that are built after June 2005 Samsung added a video game mode function to the TV that enhances video gameing.  These TV's have no issue what so ever.  So don't be agraid to buy this TV - it's the best DLP in it's class - perhaps in any class. I compared to Mitsubishi, JVC, and Toshiba.

This Samsung is AWESOME.  I am speechless.  Once I hooked up the HDTV cable box my jaw dropped.  Watching anything HD becomes an experience!TV has plenty of features.  However, the one feature I wish it had was to make the TV speakers the stereo's center channel.  Being such a thin TV you cannot rest the center channel on top as I did with my CRT Projection.No big deal though.If you can come up with the scratch for a TV like this, you won't be let down!", "Date": "June 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "GREAT T.V.", "Author": "Robert Soltz", "ReviewID": "R4889X5E0Q3ZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I probably spent 60 hours researching this TV.  During my research I learned about a few possible downsides; the DLP chip is not the newest, greatest version. Picture quality when going through a digital cable box, in the lower 100 channels is not as good as higher numbered channels or when the cable is connected directly. The PIP controls are awkward. But the pros far outweighed the cons. I ordered the set.The picture, especially in HIDEF is unbelievable. If you like PIP you can actually watch the equivalent of two 32\" simultaneously.One thing I really like about DLP is that there is no worry about picture degradation or burn in.  I also own a LCD TV.  That sets owners manual states not to watch shows that don't fill the whole screen more then 10% of the time.  I don't like having to \"zoom\" pictures to fill the screen.  With the HLR56687W, it is a non-issue.  Those shows that don't fill the entire screen are still plenty big, and because of the design of the TV I usually don't even notice that they are not wide format.Amazon.com was $500 less then Circuit City on this set. Also  Amazon.com only charged $149 for delivery and setup.  Almost all the other internet sites selling this set wanted between $215 and $300 for delivery \"to the door only\".If you are looking for a large screen TV, BUY THIS SET, you will not be sorry!", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Loving this tv!", "Author": "Florian Schouten", "ReviewID": "RG7YIF2P33ENA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had it for about two weeks now.

It faces a couple of big windows but we still get a bright, beautiful picture during the day.If you need a wide viewing angle on your tv or want to mount it on a wall, go with plasma instead.

The TV is amazing - great picture from far away and up close.  I am also happy with the quality of picture from the side angles.  The setup was incredibly easy - I was watching TV within fifteen minutes of the delivery men knocking on my door.  If I wasn't happy before all of this, I watched football in high-def over the weekend, and without question, this is one of the best purchases I have ever made.

I recently hosted my company party at my home - my company designs and installs large scale audio and video systems. All the video geeks were blown away by the high definition picture from this set!I purchased from Amazon, saved about a grand over the local shops and superstores, and delivery was perfect.If I had anything negative to say about it, I wish it had two HDMI inputs, since I have Samsung's DVD player with HDMI output. I am using the one input for the HD cable box.

I considered the plasma's and the LCD's, but this TV is so much better than what I saw at several seperate stores.  The picture quality is great, and even the sound quality isn't too bad either as a stand alone.  When I have my 6.1 suround sound BOSE speakers connected with the TV it makes any movie, TV show or game sound incredible.  For this past Super Bowl we had a party, and everyone commented on the TV and the quality of the HD channels.  I currently go through Comcast for my cable company, and us componet cables for almost everything I have.  I also have a Sony DVD player, XBOX, PS2, Gamecube, and XBOX 360 all connected to my TV by my receiver.  Everything that I play or watch looks great, and I have no complaints with the quality.  My only complaint would be the lack of options on the PIP.  I have an old 32\" Sony flatscreen TV and it came with a lot of options for PIP.  If you do or don't use PIP(picture in picture), it doesn't matter because this TV is still Excellent!!!", "Date": "May 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Investment", "Author": "St.Eve", "ReviewID": "R1L7AEAZVHCG8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally decided to upgrade from my 27\" tube and go with a big HDTV.  I purchased this tv last weekend (03-31-06) from a local Circuit City store.  They had it delivered the very next day, unboxed it, conntected it, and made sure it worked.  The picture quality is incredible.  I also purchased a Samsung progressive scan HD-convert DVD player with this TV.  I don't think I will ever go to the movie theater again.  The sound quality from the built in speakers is decent.  I have the TV hooked up to my HTS so I only use the TV's speakers when I watch regular tv.I hooked up my Xbox to this TV using the component cables and the graphics are incredible.  Be sure to go into your Xbox settings (from the dashboard) and enable 480p, 720p, 1080i, and widescreen.  I didn't do that at first and was very disappointed with the graphics and got nausea from the stretched and blocky image.  Once I enabled those settings it made a HUGE difference.  Also, the menu and setup for the tv is extremely user-friendly.  It is very straight forward and self explanatory.My complaints about this tv are the TV Guide feature, the included (universal) tv remote included, and the \"rainbow effect\".  As far as the TV Guide, it does not work for me at all.  I've keyed in all our local settings and it is not providing us with any listings.  Everything is showing \"not available\".  As far as the tv remote, it's a universal remote which allows you to program and control a DVD player, VCR, and Cable box.  Like I said, I purchased a Samsung DVD player along with this tv and am only able to control \"play\" and \"stop\" from the tv remote.  I am unable to scroll through the DVD menu, needless to say make any selections.  Good thing I purchased a separate universal remote from CC at the time of this purchase.  The \"rainbow effect\" was only something I had read about in regards to DLP's but never actually seen it.  Yesterday, however,  I started noticing it while watching a DVD (24 season 3).  It only occurs in certain scenes, and like I said, I only noticed it for the first time yesterday, so it's only on certain DVD's.Someone had mentioned a loud fan.  If you are watching tv on mute you will hear the fan, but I sure don't.  You will only hear the fan after you turn off your TV.  The fan will stay on for about a minute to cool down the bulb.  Not a problem for me.Overall, the picture quality is incredible.  Watching anything in HD makes up for the negative.  If you plan on using HDMI I'd recommend buying the HDMI cable from Walmart for about $25.  The least expensive HDMI cable Circuit City had was selling for an outrageous $100.  I did purchase a Monster Surge Protector (stage 1) for a little over $100.  I would highly recommend it.  If I could do it again I probably would have invested in a stage 2 or 3 surge protector and paid the extra $200-$300.  I did not opt for their extended warranty.PS.  Our living room looks so much nicer with this TV, it's not only a great piece of electronic, but also a great piece of furniture.", "Date": "April 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Lincoln R.

I was unsure about purchasing such a big ticket item online, but after shopping around and reading all of the other reviews on this site about delivery and no hassles I am glad I didn't settle for what I could gt at a Best Buy or Circut City.  The only place I saw that had a slightly lower price for this model was on Ebay, but that was without shipping.  Did I mention shipping from Amazon was FREE.  I was really happy and surprised about that.So far after watching a DVD (Star Wars III) and flipping through the channels I have to say that this TV is great.  I have it hooked up to a Bose 3.2.1 system and they really go well together.

I am very glad I did. This TV is great and just like everyone says, 15 minutes after opening it you're watching great TV. It takes some tweaking to get it looking better but even out of the box, it's cool. I used the Star Wars Episode III disc to optimize the DVD settings with the THX optimizer and now DVDs look even better. I still have to get the HDMI cable to make the digital cable look better. Great TV, great price. Downsides are just like everyone else said - the TV guide feature is highly annoying. Samsung would do well to get rid of them. I actually can't figure out how to disable it completely yet but I reduced it somewhat. The PIP might not be the best but my digital cable has PIP so I'll use that one. These are SMALL gripes. This TV is amazing and all my pals with high end TVs were really impressed. The family is happy and so am I. Just be careful with it on the stand as it's not that heavy and one good push can knock it off. I'm going to get some rubber feet for it or something...DO NOT Hesitate to buy this television.

First of all, the price is excellent. Best Buy sells this for $2699.00. Plus, you'll pay tax and probably pay for delivery too. Amazons listed price is ALL you'll pay.

The picture is bright with great color rendition. With HD (we have DISH satellite service) it is simply unbelievable the degree of clarity and detail. Using the latest Star Wars DVD as another example you'll see detail you never saw at the theater. We use an older progressive scan and I can't imagine it being any better!On the initial selection process we chose this over Sony based on side by side comparisons. We had a hard time deciding between this model and the 50\" Samsung. We sit 15' away and we were afraid this TV would overwhelm the room. Bottomline, if you're facing the same situation, get the 56\". Also I designed/built a new stand to accommodate the TV.. it's worked out great. The dimensions of that are 24\"deep x 5' long x 26\" high. It works and views great at that level.For those with shipping concers the delivery was great. They had a high end trucking service that brought the TV in , took it out the box and plugged it in to make sure it was OK.This is a great TV!

Two gentlemen removed the set from the box, brought it in the house and set the whole thing up cables and all.  They also gave us plenty of time to look everything over and be sure there were no problems. The picture is so clear and bright and of course there are no words to describe the HD. The price was incredible as even with the shipping charges it was over $800 less than in any local store such as CC, BB or Sears. We decided not to purchase the Extended Warranty but we did register the TV on our Visa and they will give us a second year of warranty at no charge.

Setup and controls are easy with tons of hookups and inputs on the back and side. Plenty of screen setting and did I mention the BRIGHT pricture. I'd say you really need to be at the very least 10' away to see the best picture as any closer you will see some pixelling with regular SAT input without the upgrade to HDMI receiver and HD service.I do recommend that you upgrade all of your cables to the best you can afford it goes a long way to improve the picture. I can use the PIP and run my PC screen on one side and watch TV on the other. Which is handy if you are a ADHD multi-tasker like myself. But admittedly running the PC on a S-Video cable doesn't give you the same quality screen you'll get on the PC. I'm using a laptop so I have no other outputs on it. Might try the PC-IN the TV has to offer on a desktop system and see if it's any better one day but right now it's not an issue. However it is nice to play a game in 56\" and game from regular gaming stations like PS2 or Gamecube look GREAT. Some have noted problems with gaming but most of game we use a slower games and I have not noticed a problem or I'm sure I would have heard about it from the short people. As I noted componant and optical cables do a lot and really do there most with DVD's. I can't say much about the sound I don't use it as I use a surround sound system as I think most people would. It a great TV have a great picture that you can see from the sides as well as the front with no loose of picture like you get on some projection TV.

I have owned many TVs in the past, sticking mostly to the Hitachi brand name because of the success I have had with it over the years.  This was the first time I had purchased a TV over the Internet.  Prior to purchasing, I went to a local store and previewed the TV.  I then purchased the TV on Amazon for $1,999, which was significantly less than anywhere else.  This is a TV that is feature-rich, well built, with good sound and a great picture.  The TV's PC input is exceptional, blowing up the computer screen to 56 inches and making the online experience almost presentation like.My only frustration is that 95% of cable channels are either standard definition or digital, neither of which support the TV's 16:9 viewing angle.  The TV (or some cable boxes) will stretch the picture to fit the \"wide screen\" format, but it clearly disorts the picture and stretches everything.

My one and only complaint is trying to use the Samsung built in speakers for my center channel ( TV Voice ). Hooking the TV in with my AC3 5.1 surround sound amplifier was a complete bust.  The Samsung does a lot of video processing ( de-interlacing interlaced video, etc ) which takes time. Samsung apparently delays the audio feed to match  the video latency. If I use the Samsung for my center audio channel, the delay between the TV speakers and my L+R surround speakers is terrible ( think echo-echo-echo ).

Melcher", "ReviewID": "R28SVL46WEHO96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am flabbergasted at the reviews describing \"lag-time\" on video game play for this set.  It is totally incorrect.  If you are playing legacy consoles such as PS2, Cube or first gen X-box some of the games cannot be played in 16:9 ratio because the stretching to fit this view distorts certain aspects of the game making it seem to lag.  For instance if you are familiar with Mario Golf on the Cube, there is a power bar at the bottom of the screen that determines the strength of the swing.  As the meter crosses the screen you have to push the 'A' button at the yard mark for your shot.  If you are playing in 16:9 mode it looks like there is lag from the time that you hit the 'A' button and where the meter shows that you hit it, it is just due to the stretching from 16:9 mode.  Just change the view to 4:3 and the \"problem\" is solved.  DLP sets are perfect for gaming because of the no 'burn in' design.This is really a great set that looks good and has A+ picture quality.

After a couple of months of researching the pro's and con's of DLP vs. LCD vs. Plasma I finally went with the 56\" Samsung just for the fact that my friend had his for 6 months at that point and had no problem. Now where to order it from? It made no sense to pay the extra cash that the big box stores were advertising the same TV from anywhere from $500 to $2500 more then some on line stores. Now the question became who to choose as my on line store. So once again the research began, pro's and con's to alot of stores, even some bad reviews of Amazon.Com. I decided to go with Amazon, because I had used them in the past for some smaller item purchases and never had any issues. I am glad I went with Amazon.Com as I believe I got the best price at the time for the same TV then several other on line store. Ended up paying right at 1999.99 for this TV. Actually only $200 more then my friends 50\"! The only issue that I had with Amazon.Com was when I initially ordered the TV on a Thurs. the web site said it shipped in 24 hrs and was in stock. Well it was in stock but what happened was that as a security measure from my credit card company, they put a hold on the purchase until verification was given that I was ordering the TV. The problem was that Amazon sent me the confirmation that the order had been received but had not been processed yet and that they would send me another email when the transaction processed. Now it's Friday and I still never receive another email stating the transaction went through. So I call Amazon's customer service, which by the way, was very good! Despite reading some negative reviews. I had no problem contacting them. As a matter of fact they have a cool on line contacting system where you tell them to call you either immediately or in increments of 5 or 10 min. You give them a number to call and BAM your phone rings!  I suppose you just need to know how to navigate their site. I had no problem with it. Anyway, when I did talk to them they said they werent sure why it hadnt processed but was sure it would be ok by 5pm. Sat morning, still no confirmation! So I decided to call the credit card company on my own just to verify that the transaction had even hit their system. It did, but were waiting on verification from me the the order was valid. So I clear that up and they process the order right then. That was the only real heart burn that I had with Amazon, they should have been able to tell me that the CC company needed to be contacted vs. me doing it myself. So now it's Sun, 3 days after my initial order. Get the confirmation email from Amazon saying it will ship on Mon as they don't ship on Sun. Mon morning rolled around and I get the email stating it was shipped out with at tracking number. Well the tracking # didn't work when I went to check it and again I called Amazon customer service and again very good service from the people I talked to. They gave me the name of the shipping company and number and said if I had any additional issue to call them back. I didn't, with the exception of getting the first available date of delivery to my house, which wasn't amazon's fault. So in total it ended up being 10 days before I got my TV. Once it was finally delivered to the house the guys came in unpacked it and set it up. Right out of the box the picture was great! I had read many reviews that a lot of work had to be done to get the pic right. Not in my case. I was waiting on my DirecTV HD box so I just had standard cable but even that looked great running it through my S-Video cable. DVD's spectacular! Once I got the HD TV up and running a few days later and surround sound going it has been the best investment that I have made in awhile. The picture is stellar, no pixallization (sp?) and a lot of local channels are broadcasting in HD now. I acuatlly have had more problems with the satellite feed then the TV itself.  If you looking at this TV it is worth the money. Just don't have that new TV fever thinking you will have it in a few days.

The performance of the TV all depends on your source signal.  Given a good HD signal the picture on this TV is just awesome, but analog signal looks bad due to the large size of the screen.  SD signal produces ok pictures.  Moving pictures in all 3 signal modes are clear with no blurring or streaking.There is plenty of inputs for all the accessory one would need.  I recommend using the component video inputs whenever possible for best picture quality.  My playstation 2 works great on this TV with no delay of any sort.  My buddy says the picture quality will be better if I use the component video inputs, but I haven't got around to buying the cable yet.Most TV of this class have more than 30watts for sound, but this hasn't been an issue at all.  For normal viewing I'm only using about 1/5 of max.  I find the sound quality to be excellent on this TV.I really like the antenna/cable button on the remote, since I have analog cable and use a roof top antenna for many over the air broadcast HD channels.  Most of the 80 or so channels on my Comcast analog cable service is SD quality, and there are only a handful of HD channels.The negatives of this TV so far has been the lack of a HD tuner for the PIP feature, and the lack of a PIP/main picture swap button on the remote.  (PIP won't pickup HD channels, and you have to go into several layers in the menu to swap pictures with the PIP.Speaking of menus, the transparent on screen menu on this TV is very cool, as you can see the effect of the changes or adjustment you're making as you make them.Given my experience thusfar I would buy this TV again, and I'm sure most people will be very happy with it as well.", "Date": "March 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "We love our BIG TV...", "Author": "G.

Of course I was nervous about buying such a high priced item on line from Amazon but I have always had good luck with Amazon. And no you can't beat their price. This TV delivered was still about $700 cheaper (can pay for two bulb replacements)than Circuit City and Best Buy. Delivery only took six days and the guys who unloaded it were very professional and neat. I had it up and running in about five minutes. I just had the cable card installed yesterday to do away with another box and it works awesome. The HD channels are insane!! I wish there were more but in due time. The regular digital channels come in good not nearly as good as the HD channels but that is nothing against the TV. It is my cable providers siganal (Cox). The only two gripes I have are the TV guide system does not put the channels in the numerical order that I receive them from Cox. They are all over the place so I have to sit down and put them in the order I want one by one unfortunately. And I wish they had a swap button for the picture in picture. You have to go through the whole menu to swap the channels but very minor complaints considering the overall package. This TV in a wall entertainment center looks like a flat panel and people do not believe it is a rear projection.

The picture is great, especially wiht HD signals.  I got a CABLE CARD from my cable company so I don't need a box and I can use the TV's TV GUIDE which is less of a hassle.  The only reason why I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because of the remote, espeically the PIP function. You have to go to the MENU to change the PIP inputs and you can only use the UP/DOWN buttons to change the channels.  This is a major hassle during football season when I want to watch multiple games to keep track of my fantasy teams (guys, you know what I'm talking about!).

I did not know that the standard \"broadcast\" channels (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox) on HD can come through via an antenna  - without cable or sat - with perfect reception; the channel is either perfect or it doesn't come in at all. Very cool. In my case,  all I did was hook up an extra coaxial cable to the antenna-out and all those HD channels come in perfectly.  Also, for you novices, the HD channels come in via other channel numbers (so a your CBS channel 2 may be channel 60 in HD - look on the web for listings).Anyway, as I said in the first version of this review, the thing about the TV that STILL drives me crazy that no one else has complained about is the noise the fan makes in the TV. I gotta tell you, that constant  \"humming\" drives me nuts - I can hear it very clearly whenever the sound gets low. And it's coming from the fan vent cover in the back. Maybe I have a defect or something, or maybe I just have very sensitive ears, but my 5-year old 42\" Sony projection TV makes not a hint of noise. Doesn't this bug anybody else?BTW, I switched from Dish to Comcast because Dish requires a $300 up-front payment to get an HD tuner with a DVR (plus a monthly fee). Comcast doesn't charge the upfront cost. I can't tell a great deal of difference between the cable and satellite, although some channels look better than others.
