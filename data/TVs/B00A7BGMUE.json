{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Inexpensive not cheap", "Author": "NeverBend", "ReviewID": "RY6TFT8HJREES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My main family TV is a Samsung 55\" plasma that died twice within 10 months of purchase (Samsung repaired it under warranty).  Great picture but we hold our breath every time the screen does anything out of the ordinary.  The TV is less than 2 years old.I've been looking for a 46\"-50\" basic LED TV in the Black Friday sales to give to my wife for Christmas that could also serve as a (temporary) replacement when the Samsung's dies (as I suspect it will).I had never heard of oCosmo but it seemed like a perfect fit with features beyond the basics that I'd have settled for including USB, QAM tuner and Roku ready.  For less than $400 tax paid, shipped to my door with a 5 year extended warranty I bought it despite no user reviews (at that time).It was ordered on Monday and received on Wednesday.  No HDMI cable was included (do any sets include them?).  The power cable is attached to the set (and protected in foam for shipping). Normally I'd wait before posting a review but there's little history or feedback on the oCosmo brand so I do so with the understanding that my comments are made after only about 8 hours of use.Packaging:  TV arrived well packed with foam and self-stick cellophane protecting the screen.  The oCosmo wasn't deficient in packaging and the set arrived in good order.Install:  Followed the Quick Install instructions and had the set running in a couple of minutes.  All ports are clearly defined (better than my Samsung) and have easy access.  Front panel push button controls are accessible, work and don't feel balky.Setup:  I used the remote to run through the setup.  The granularity of picture/audio control is acceptable for me but less than the Samsung and perhaps not as refined as some would like.  I did find that I had to press several times to access some of the menu items (perhaps the supplied AAA batteries were weak?).Picture:  The picture, out of the box and without adjustment, is good.  I compared the oCosmo to my Samsung (Plasma) with the same shows and movies and the Samsung is a little sharper (on faces but not patterns) and has better color balance.  How much of the difference is Plasma to LED or that I've tuned the Samsung I can't say but the oCosmo picture taken by itself is good or better and it's superior to most similar sized TVs that I recently saw at a big box store.  Whites are bright, blacks are dark and colors have good saturation.Audio:  Sound quality was like most unaided sets that I've heard.  I set the bass to 8 and treble to 3 and this added richness and distinction to the sound.  At 6'-8' and a volume setting of 20 or more the sound volume was acceptable.  There's little gain in volume past a setting of 30, in other words, a setting of 90 sounded like it should have been 40.  If you want it loud or the movie experience you'll need to add that capability.Initial impression:  Since the oCosmo 47\" TV is primarily a Christmas gift for my wife it's already a success since she loves it.  She has no complaints whatsoever.  I'm more critical about picture quality (as noted above) but as a potential backup to the frail Samsung the oCosmo would be perfectly acceptable for as long as we would need to use it and I like the feature set that seems to have been selected for practical need and not gimmick (like the rarely used 3D on the Samsung).Nothing that I've seen, from packaging to manuals, build quality or performance makes me think of a cheap product.  I'd call it inexpensive and at a total cost of less than $400 (including the extended warranty) the oCosmo has the look of a winner.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Frills TV with Great Picture Quality", "Author": "2busy", "ReviewID": "R1TBBJ3FKXGBH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quite frankly, I don't know how they're able to sell something like this for so cheap ($329). So far the TV is excellent. It requires setting the colors to one's own preferences or leaving it in one of the preset modes to get the desired look. Once it's set, it rivals many of the brand names. The speakers are a bit underpowered. However, for this price, we're considering an external set in any event.

As another reviewer mentioned regarding the 40\" version of this TV, the Sony RMVZ220 universal remote control works on this 47\" TV as well - using the out-of-the-box preset factory settings on the remote. The instructions that come with the remote describe the button functions. A programmable remote would probably be better however to capture buttons for some options and Roku functions.Also, as others have mentioned, the TV comes with a coupon and code which offers $20 off (as of 12/12) a Roku streaming stick from Roku's website.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good value", "Author": "H.R.

Based on the reviews of the 40\" oCosmo set I took a chance and ordered one. This set appears to be the same as a Sceptre E475BV-FMDU. The manuals, menus, bodies, etc., all look the same. I wanted another TV to have around in the basement for connecting my last gen consoles to. I wasn't expecting much for the price but figured it'd be OK to play around on.I knew there would be compromises made and here is what I have noticed:-The remote feels cheap and a couple times while gripping it and pressing the buttons I have popped the battery door open. They do give you batteries branded \u201cLT Super Lusty\u201d (LOL) for the remote.-The picture also looks a bit grainy when compared to my other sets. It doesn\u2019t seem to be related to the sharpness control. Maybe it is the dot pitch of the screen but I am not sure what causes it.-The overall picture is not bad once you play around with it. I turned all the extra picture processing features off.-There is backlight bleed and flash lighting from the sides and corners that is noticeable in dark scenes but I expected this with a cheap set. This set is bright. There is no backlight adjustment that I have found. It seems to be permanently set at full brightness. If you are using this TV in a bedroom at night it is pretty bad because of the extreme brightness. In a bigger room or well lit room it isn't as much of a problem. Usually you can temper the backlight bleed by lowering the backlight brightness on a set but you don't have that option here. I wonder if a firmware update could enable backlight adjustment because in the specifications part of the manual it says Lamp Adjust: Yes.-The set doesn\u2019t seem to support HDMI CEC control and I didn\u2019t see mention of it in the manual. It doesn\u2019t respond to my receiver or Sony Google TV box like my other sets.-The sound isn\u2019t anything great and I didn\u2019t expect it to be. I use external speakers with all my sets.-You get a tempered glass stand that I am meh about. I hope it doesn\u2019t decide to shatter one day and drop the set on its face. They do give you a screwdriver and screws to attach it with though.I haven\u2019t done a lot of gaming on it yet because I wanted to get this review up to help holiday shoppers but I will report back if I have any problems that I notice gaming. The manual says the screen is rated at 8ms but the oCosmo website says 6ms. I don\u2019t know which is right.After getting the set and playing with it for a bit I think it is a pretty nice TV for the $329 that I got it for. My whole opinion of this set is based around its price. There is no way I would have accepted this set at a higher price but for what it cost it is acceptable.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised!", "Author": "Melvin Hines", "ReviewID": "R3VWHKDVIICM52", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the oCosmo TV not knowing anything about the brand. This obviously concerned me, but I figured it must be some Black Friday deal. It turns out that oCosmo is (1) a new company formed just this year (2013), and (2) somehow related to the bargain brand Sceptre.Finding all of this out made me understandably skeptical, especially after I received a defective TV in poor packaging when I ordered my 46\" Black Friday Westinghouse TV. When I first received the oCosmo TV, the first thing I noticed was the weight. This was MUCH heavier than the Westinghouse, which concerned me some. Upon opening, I noticed why however. From what I can tell so far, everything about this TV has been very high quality. The stand (compared to the plastic Westinghouse stand) is what appears to be a steel construction. That stand, the TV, and everything else in the box was carefully packaged. Even the tool oCosmo sent to have the TV screwed into the stand was a high-quality screw driver! Once you would buy from a store. Once I put the TV on the stand, I was also pleasantly surprised to find out that it is a swivel stand as well. Then, I turned on the TV. The visual quality was excellent! Now, I had a 42\" Sony flat screen that lasted me nearly 10 years, and in comparison the sound of the Sony TV was much better. But the visual quality of this TV is breathtaking!

I installed it this morning and have the kids checking it out.  My first impressions are it's not the TV you buy to impress everyone on the block with BOOMING SOUND and CRYSTAL CLEAR viewing.  It's the TV you get to upgrade cheaply from 32\" to 47\" and accept it for it's weaknesses.Likes:It's BIGIt has 3 HDMI (1 of which is a MHL - Mobile High-def Link)Bright screenBatteries for remote are made by Lusty (not sure if that's a like or dislike)Dislikes:Remote is el cheapo feeling.

Hopefully universal remote knows oCosmoSound is tinny... gives you that retro 19\" retro tube TV feel.So if you only want to spend $350 and don't care to much about sound quality (maybe you're running to a Sound System anyway) then this is an OK purchase.

I opened it up and noted the quality of the packaging and included materials (including a small screwdriver for attaching the tempered glass swivel base)!I'm not going to lie\u2014purchasing an off-brand TV with hardly any reviews, I was extremely scared.  This is the first TV I've ever bought (being a hard-working full-time commuting college student and part-time employee) and I've never had enough money laying around to buy a big Sony or Samsung!REVIEW:At 47\" and full 1080p, the picture is incredible.  I'm used to the picture of my parents 55\" high-end Samsung, and, while I admit the picture is better on that one, honestly, there's not much complaining to be done about this one. I've seen so many reviews of lower-end TVs with \"bad frame rate\" (at 60Hz or 120Hz)\u2014I played Battlefield 4 for way too long last night (regrettably) and the frame rate is SMOOTH AS ANYTHING.Basically, what you're getting here is a main competition HDTV for the price of something that should be a washed out, disposable plastic box.PICTURE ADJUSTMENT:As I've found, is that, by default, the blacks are black and the whites are white\u2014HOWEVER, the dark greys are also black and the light colors are white too.  This can be fixed by turning off the dynamic contrast (and honestly, I think it looks much better and more natural this way anyway.)  The only other slight gripe I have is that the \"normal\" color profile is a bit too warm and the \"warm,\" of course, is exceptionally yellowy-orange.  The \"cool\" setting is closer to natural white, but (obviously) reduces a bit of the red spectrum unfortunately.AUDIO & INPUTS:It's fine. Seriously, a lot of TVs come with little tin can speakers...and these are better than average.  Let's face it though, people\u2014you're not buying speakers, you're buying an HDTV.  Most TV manufacturers today assume you'll be purchasing a soundbar and subwoofer and give the consumer a couple of cheap, whispery little speakers.I connected the Samsung soundbar my parents gave me for Christmas a couple years back.  Obviously, coupled with the sound, this thing looks and feels like a main-brand Samsung, Sharp...LG...etc.The connectors in the back are plentiful, color-coded and well-organized.  The built-in tuner works GREAT.  I watched several channels in FULL HD, like CBS and ION.  The picture quality there is awesome.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - -  I'm actually really excited to watch movies on this thing.

While the screen's viewing angle might not be as expansive as a Sammy's or as great in the dynamic contrast area, there's no doubt that this is a steal.I have a feeling oCosmo is taking losses on these things to establish their name as a quality TV manufacturer.

I initially bought the Seiki 46\" for the same price on Black Friday. Unfortunately when i openend it there was an issue with the Television (looked like it got dropped and had a fat black line of dead pixels accross it. Since returning it, I bought this tv) which I am pleased with.1. The look of the tv is stunning. It is very slim, much slimmer than the Seiki and has a very cool look for the price. it reminded me of an LG TV in terms of looks and finish. The stand was tempered glass and also looked very modern for the prize.2. The TV itself looks very good. This is a TV that I use in my room and bought it for its size at the cost of what is normally <40\" tv. That  being said, the tv picture quality is grainy, this might be because it is such a big size, and since it is only in my room; I am MUCH closer to the TV than in most cases. In times I am able to view low quality pictures. The settings dont seem to change too much with the tv, but overall it is a very good look for the price. Unfortunately there is no way to change backlight settings; at times I wish it was brighter, and at night lower.3. The tv has 3 HDMI, and 1 USB, the two most important things to me. The USB is not a service port, and thus is fully functional. I have yet to test if it can play .mkv files but will do so soon hopefully. This was great for me, as it actually is able to hide a chromecast fully and keep the visible wires down to one for me (power).4. The remote is quite possibly the worst I have used. This is where my one star reduction comes from. Many times it takes multiple pushes of a button for the tv to register it and changing the settings at the beginning was abysmal. If the remote worked properly this would be great.All in all this was a great purchase for the price. Much better than all other TV's that are in remotely the same price range\\.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceptional value if you want a big TV", "Author": "Chris Moore", "ReviewID": "R2CY0N8XB33S17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV when there were no reviews, knowing that it was most likely a rebrand of Sceptre. I took a chance because I don't need a lot from my TV, and I knew Amazon would take it back if it was really bad. I have actually been VERY impressed with this television for this price.The TV is packaged exceptionally well, especially considering this price point. UPS/FedEx would have to almost intentionally try to smash this thing for it not to arrive in good shape. Set-up was very easy. The base gets screwed on to the TV with five screws. I was going to the garage to get a screwdriver when my wife informed me that it came with one. The TV actually came with a half-way decent screwdriver! I've never seen that. The build quality if fairly good. Not as good as the high-end \"name\" brands like Samsung or Vizio, but just as good as their lower-end offerings.We have an over-the-air antenna and a Roku. The digital tuner is really sensitive. I've had very little luck getting the local CBS station on the Vizio that we own, but it comes in clear on this TV with exactly the same antenna set-up. The on-screen set-up menus are a little clunky, but they are pretty self explanatory. You don't have a ton of control over the picture and sound, but you really don't need it, unless you are an extreme picture/sound person, in which case, you wouldn't be buying this TV.The picture is fantastic out of the box, but everyone likes to tweak to fit their preferences, and you have that ability. I don't know that much about these things, which is probably why I'm 100% satisfied with what I see. Someone else might try to compare this to a higher-end TV and find differences in picture. I cannot. If you are like me, then save hundreds of dollars and get this TV. If you need 240 Hz refresh, know what response rate means, etc. then maybe spend about twice for the same size. Watching football in HD, I actually can see the difference between 60 Hz and 120-240 Hz, but it isn't a $300+ difference for me. Your mileage might vary.The sound out of the factory speakers is pretty much terrible. I have never owned a TV with decent sound. I have never seen a TV in the store with built in sound quality that I find acceptable. Therefore, I already have a soundbar. I have actually turned the speakers on the TV off and use my soundbar exclusively. This is pretty easy to do in the menu. With the speakers on, if I set the EQ to the preset \"Rock\" setting, I get really bad vibration from the speakers when they go above about 15-20. I didn't have this problem with any other setting, or when I just disabled the EQ. Don't know what that is about, but if the internal speaker system is something you are interested in, then be careful. If you have an external speaker system, then don't worry.The remote is really cheap and requires you to mash down pretty hard. I also couldn't control my older Roku with it as it suggested. I'm sure a new streaming stick would work fine, but I haven't tested this capability. I use a universal remote, anyway, so a crappy remote wouldn't be a deal killer for me. Panasonic makes a great one that can learn commands from any remote for about $15. Using that remote, I programed my universal to Sony codes (as stated in the manual), and then swapped the volume and mute buttons to run my sound bar. Happy as can be. One remote for the TV, sound bar, DVD player, and Roku.In summary, for $330 this TV cannot be beat. I rate it 5 stars at this price. If this TV was $650 like the TVs I was looking at before taking the plunge on this one, then I would rate it 4 stars. I would be ok with this TV at twice the cost. I'm ecstatic about it at $330. For $330 for the TV, $60 for a Roku streaming stick, $100 for a decent vizio sound bar, $15 for a universal remote, and $30 for a 4-year extended warranty, you have an exceptional smart TV set-up for about $530 that you can feel confident about for the next 4-5 years or more. I can't even find another TV this size alone for that price.Time will tell if it holds up. Spend the extra $20-30 for the extended warranty if that worries you. The warranty I bought covers in-home technical service on this size TV, so you wouldn't even need to worry about shipping it back if you have a problem 3 years down the road. I usually skip these warranties, but considering no one has ever heard of an oCosmo, and the thing was already so darn cheap, I went ahead and bought it. If the TV falls apart one day after my warranty coverage, then it will still have been worth the price and if oCosmo is still a thing at that point, then I would buy another.

The remarkable Amazon price for this TV on CyberMonday and a few days following with free shipping has now increased by $150.I bought the oCosmo to replace my previous \u201cbig\u201d TV (32\u201d), which is now moved to my office. Handling the 32\u201d is child\u2019s play compared with the 47\u201d (it weighs 42 lbs. with its very heavy base). As an old guy working alone with a bad back, I had to plan every move\u2014getting it out of the carton, attaching the base, placing the table it sits on, and moving it into place\u2014so as not to drop or bump it or end up on the floor myself with back spasms. The shipping carton was in perfect condition as was the TV. Everything worked out, and, once I followed the instructions correctly, got my Dish Network remote to recognize the TV and control the power, volume, and mute functions.The oCosmo remote is big and complex looking but was easy to figure out for making adjustments to the picture and sound and setting the date and time. Lots of other functions are controlled from the remote, including managing an oCosmo sound bar. (I never expect much from built-in TV speakers so am using a low end set of external Logitech speakers that work just fine from the TV\u2019s headphone port.)Overall, I definitely feel that this is a 5 star product based on less than one day of experience. And even at the new, higher price, I think it\u2019s still a bargain. Just one complaint\u2014many important cable connections\u2014including HDMI\u2014to and from the TV face downward from the back of the set, not outward (there are also some on the left side).

Du", "ReviewID": "R20XAPY2A3FCW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this TV today. As a student on a budget, this was a great deal (time of purchase: $329). I will attempt to review this product from an average-tech-Joe's perspective, as I have never had a TV bigger than 21', nor a sound-system of any sort.On arrival, the product is well packaged. Within, you get: the 47' TV, a glass stand (fairly sturdy), a remote w/ batteries, 5 screws, a screwdriver, and the TV manual. It was easy to assemble, and everything was set up within 10 minutes. The remote is somewhat cheap, but it was functional so I really have no complaints.I have basic cable with no HD channels; not-surprisingly, I was not impressed with how it looked. But when I connected my PS3 to it (via HDMI), I was absolutely blown away! The picture quality was clear and beautiful, and the sound quality was crisp. I live in an apartment, so I really don't notice the softness of the TV's audio that other reviewers described. Games (Farcry 3 and GTA V) and blu-ray movies (Avatar and Dark Knight) looked fantastic with no signal-delay. I also did not notice any ghosting. Lastly, I connected my computer to it (via HDMI). Netflix and internet browsing (youtube and ESPN online) looked great as well, with no noticeable image delays.Along with the TV, I also purchased a 3 year protection plan for 15 bucks. Very happy with the quality of this TV. If you guys have any questions, please ask and I will try my best to answer them.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "WORK'S/LOOK'S GREAT!!!!", "Author": "Destoney", "ReviewID": "R3J54VJZIUNCNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will start off to say for quick readers The television is Very Well worth it and Looks GREAT!!!!!When i received my television i got everything hooked up fine. I turned the massive LED TV on forthe first time. The screen was the blue setup screen. First thing i noticed, My remote did not work.So i thought batteries where bad. Found out later remote was DOA. Back to the TV.In Settings there is an option for BLACK or BLUE screen when there is no input/nothing connected.I chose to turn it black. I instantly noticed color change ( Greenish White smokie ) look in one of the corners about6 inches long. For some reason i tried convincing myself it was because it was a 300 dollar Television. How goodcould it get..... So i played games watched movies on the TV and all the colors looked great. But as soon as a blackpicture would come in. It looked like a sunrise in the top corner along with a few other blotches. so i called amazon andthey told me a replacement will be there 2 day shipping and free shipping back on the bad one. I poked the top of the screen where it was bad and the screen was loose. I was disappointed and thought i should have paid 300 extra for a good TV. Anyway I sent the one back and received my new TV. Opened it very Carefully, put the bottom stand on.. Put batteries in remote. Felt the corners everything was tight !!!! YES. Then i waited for the TV to warm up. -21 Degree's here. Turned it on. changed the screen to black to see if there was any fading. ----------------TURNED OUT FLAWLESS Picture was great ! Remote worked good :) Blacks where all Black in the corners. Color pops out ! Great sound for a TV. I do not regret this purchase at all. I did a little review of my Bad TV so other people can check when they receive theirs. Overall I'm very happy with the TV and amazon Took care of me like usual. Assuming Other people will get a Good one and i just got a lemon. the Television works Great For An Amazing price.

I found the picture to be crystal clean with no modification necessary.  The sound is just OK, and if you want to hook up a sound bar other than oCOSMO make sure not to get one that requires an optical or ARC HDMI connection because this TV has neither.  I just bought a nice SONY HTCT260H Sound Bar with Wireless Subwoofer only to find out that the TV didn't have what it took to make it work so I had to return it.Another feature that could have been improved was the HDMI outlets.  They are under the lip in the back of the unit so you're basically working blind trying to get those darned cables in there.Finally, it's no slim bezel television.  It's fat and heavy, but as I said, for the $329.00 investment I won't complain.  The TV has a great picture, but mediocre sound.

Just keep it in mind in terms of value.  During the holiday season I got a great deal on a soundbar and subwoofer combo so even when you consider paying for that, it was a good purchase that I don't regret.

One thing lacking though is that the HDMI ports can't wake up the TV from standby (e.g. which devices like Chromecast can take advantage of so you don't need the TV remote to start watching).As many have reported, the remote needs to be aimed directly at the receiver, like within a few degrees. To fix this, simply pop the plastic over off the top of the remote.  Now I can point the remote in any direction and it works 100%.

Good picture, remote is a joke, horrible sound like other buyers found out. The picture is really good for digital but awful for standard definition. There is light bleeding on right side mostly which is very evident against a black screen (such as on an HDMI input with the connected device off). I turned off the automated features like some reviewer recommended, but I wish someone who knows this stuff better would post numbers for \"best picture settings.\"The sound is horrible which automatically forces the user to attach an external audio set, except my soundbar uses an Optical In, and this TV has no Optical, Coax only. The TV's digital output over Coax only outputs the Antenna Tuner in bitstream 5.1 format, everything else connected to the TV then out via SPIDF is PCM.. So I have an older Bose sound system with Coax that I used with this TV and it works fine, so at least I verified that the sound being bad is caused by bad TV speakers and not bad components or circuitry within the TV..When the Apple TV 3rd Gen connects to TV via HDMI, then out to Bose over the Coax from TV its sound is good bu not great, but when I output Apple TV's HDMI video to TV and Apple's Optical Out to the Bose Optical In it sounds really good and looks perfect. (EDIT: I had thought this was due to not routing the sound through the TV and down mixing to Stereo PCM, but I was told in the comments that PCM is not stereo, so i stand corrected). As far as I know, HDTV Cable audio is the only thing that will go over the oCOSMO Coax Out in bitstream 5.1 and it sounds really good out of the Bose speakers (I have no cable box attached, straight cable into TV tuner).The remote is garbage, so you need to spend another 25 for a universal remote (I have this amazing WR7 Universal Remote but it had a hell of time learning the codes for this remote.. Maybe you just need a real Sony remote).. The oCOSMO remote is so bad that even Apple TV 3rd Gen which is extremely forgiving and is willing to learn any remote, can hardly be controlled by the oCOSMO remote.. But this is not a surprise since the TV itself can hardly be controlled by its own remote. I have verified my Sony remote controls it fine (except for input where the TV expects you to press input then arrows to navigate to input, instead of pressing input multiple times to navigate to your input which is what the remote is designed to do).The TV remote's design is a feat of engineering madness in a bad way. It feels like very cheap lump of plastic and has little logic or comfort, and it is so thin it flexes (and that's not a feature)!.. Its back cover keeps falling off to flash the owner with its \"Super Lusty\" batteries (I kid you not, that's their brand)!All to say by the time you get comfortable with this TV you'd have spent at least 400 (I also bought the 5 year warranty for another 30).. So my recommendation is not to buy it even at 330.. Did I mention how horrible and basic the menus are? Also, if you look at the support website there are no firmware updates and I doubt there will ever be any. Oh, and the shipping box was badly damaged but I don't think anything was broken.The set works for me because I had lots of spare components I can reuse with it and they all work really well to make the set shine, but out of the box it really leaves a lot to be desired.UPDATE WITH RELEVANT NOTES ON SOUND FROM MANUAL:SPDIF - This connection port is used for sending out digital audio signals to digital surround sound receivers. The orange (COAX SPDIF OUT) connector sends out either bit-stream or PCM digital sound signal to a home theater receiver with digital coax input.If you want pure digital stream for your receiver to decode, you must also configure the TV's OSD Sound->Digital Audio Out function. Make sure the option is on 5.1CH.The TV's SPDIF out for 5.1CH is ONLY used for antenna/cable connection. Any other incoming audio signal will be passed out of SPDIF in PCM formatIf your receiver is making static noises when receiving 5.1CH, you must use the PCM option instead.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly AMAZING.

There was maybe one review when ordered so went simply by price and size.Major discrepancy on the posted details for this 47\" is the actual dimensions posted on product details.Claimed size:  47.6 x 6.5 x 34.1Real size:  44 2 x 4.4 x 27, these are without base.Base size:  10.2 x 19.6The base itself is impressive.

Very solid.So here are my Pros:Excellent base.Swivel feature is great!Picture is great.So far remote is working.Cons:SoundAs others have said the sound is not great. And that's saying a lot considering I gave my parents my previous flat screen a year ago and have been watching dvds on a 15.6 inch lap top with only built in speakers for the last year. Going to invest in some speakers which I would want to do regardless. This would be 5 star if sound was better.The price I purchased this TV for is well worth it.

I do think this brand would be a good buy for kids/guest room. And just for more info this TV is only hooked to a converter with antenna until this weekend when we get dvd player and is working wonderfully.12/15/2013 UPDATE: sound has gotten worse, even with constant tweaking. Goes up and down in volume as well as cutting out periodically for a few seconds. We've gotten a blu-ray player and the controlled input with quality hdmi connect makes no difference.

With temps in the 20's outside, I let it warm up a few hours before firing it up.  Initial impressions are very good.

Sound isn't too bad -I would give that 3 stars, but the picture and the exceptional value of the TV bring the overall rating up to 5 stars.Everything works as it should.  No dead pixels.  Beautiful picture!  So far so good!  I will post any updates should the TV start to act up.The remote is fine, although it seemed you had to stand fairly close to the TV.  I am a Tivo owner and I had a little trouble finding the proper remote code b/c oCosmo is not a listed brand.  It took a few minutes, but the thankfully the remote eventually found the proper code using the 0999 code/channel up technique (google it).

Stations that don't broadcast in full 1080hd....my personal opinion, the picture sucks as well.I had previously ordered the seiki 46\" that tv was great all the way around however, there was a pixel distortion that was on the left lower side of screen.

I haven't hooked up too much to it yet, just a wii and an upconverting dvd player so I haven't hooked up anything HD.  Picture so far is ok and the sound is ok at best.  There is some light bleeding and the remote is horrible, but this is for the kids playroom and is replacing a 51 inch rear projection tv, so the picture is still a big improvement over what it replaced.  The remote is very cheaply made and labeling was an afterthought.  Kinda difficult to find what you are looking for.Oh, and whoever can do something about this on Amazons side....how about NOT putting a STICKER on the screen.  I can still see where the sticker was after removing it.  Matter o' fact, I am taking back that 1/2 star from the beginning just for that.I thought it was packaged very well.Assuming it lasts, this will be sufficient for its purpose.

Upon opening the box, I noticed the bottom left where the buttons are supposed to be was cracked.  All of the buttons fell off and some into the tv.

I kept clicking enter to move onto another menu but it was stuck on initial setup.  It would not work, it kept flipping between languages.  The remote or software programming must have been defective.  I was really hoping to get the tv working but, I ended up having to request an exchange with Amazon.  I am returning this defective model received for another one that is fully functional.My first impressions:The screen size is great for the prize and it is thinSome sort of error in the software did not allow moving beyond initial setupNext, I hope to receive my new set in a few days so I can post an updated review.

Guaranteed 2 day delivery, great price, 47 inch led Roku ready tv, what a great deal! Not so much.First, delivery was a fiasco. The set did not show up when it was supposed to. Customer service said it was lost somewhere in the shipping process. The rep ordered a second set as a replacement. Two days later the ordinal set showed up. Two days after that, the second tv showed up. Though it was a pain, the duplication was resolved fairly quickly by customer service.Second, I was amazed at how poorly the tv was packaged. The set showed up on the door step in the retail box only. Very little protection for a electronic device of this size. The container had definitely seen better days.When the tv was finally opened by the gift recipient on Christmas, she found that the stand was scratched up, the frame was cracked through its width, and that two of the function buttons had fallen off (most likely due to the frame damage).This was a very disappointing experience.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Buy", "Author": "dnastar", "ReviewID": "R2KSXTGJ0Z46YY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am writing this review just after placing my order of this item. I know I probably should post the *review* after actually receive the item, but I think sharing my information might do some help to people who are wondering the same questions as me these days.I think some people first time see this TV and this brand may have the same questions as me: what is this brand? why it is so cheap? How about the build quality of this TV?I did some research online, and found something interesting about this TV. However I will not directly tell my opinion about what it is, since it is up to the reader to believe or not. I think the best way is to give the keyword and the readers can do the search by themselves, and make their own buying decision provided the information they found.The keyword is E475BV-FMDU. I think it is not hard to find out another TV given this model number. Check the product gallery, and notice the picture of its back. There is no picture of the back of this oCosmo TV here, but should be easy to find it in the oCosmo official site. Now compare the two and I found they look almost the same.For the other 2 oCosmo TVs on sale, it shouldn't be hard to find their \"sister\" products by looking into that official site of *the* 3rd party brand. So I believe this TV is a re-brand or at least manufactured by *the* 3rd party brand we just found. About the quality of the products from *the* manufacturer, I believe there are a lot reviews on the internet. At least to me, I think it is of reasonable quality.I am looking for a TV which is \"not expensive\" enough so I do not need to worry about its protection, but should have reasonable build/video quality. I do not really care about the sound quality since it is easy to use an external speaker. I also purchased the insurance so I don't really worry about how long will it last - the insurance vendor seems pretty new in this field but I know them from another insurance I purchased.Also I noticed this TV is sold by Amazon, which I think is another layer of \"protection\" because of the best customer support. Based on all these info I finally made my decision to give it a try.If I get a chance I'll update my review once I receive the item. I ordered a chromecast stick too so hopefully I can enjoy youtube on my new TV in a few days!********* 12/6 update *****************some explanation:1. Initially I gave the product 3 star rating since I think I should give some neutral rating before I actually receive it. However I changed my mind, maybe I should give it 4 stars since I would recommend to buy it even I have not received it yet. I will rate a final score once I get the set and try it out.2. Maybe I am not clear about the keyword, search E475BV-FMDU on google. The page I mentioned should appear at 2nd or 3rd entry in the results.3. I posted this early review just want to share my findings and I think it might do some help. I don't want to confuse people. Since I see most of the readers do not find it useful... If you are the reader and you don't think it is helping you, could you please add comments let me know why my review does not do any help? I'll be glad to help, or delete this review if most people think it is not necessary.********* 12/14 update *****************received the TV set on Tuesday. Connected to my desktop via HDMI, also plugged chromecast. after a few days use, i think i should give it 4.5-star by its own quality, but given its price, i do think it should get a 5-star.1. the overall build quality is good.2. this TV set is huge but not too heavy.3. the video quality is nice, but the default setting is not optimal. you may need to do some tweak to achieve best view. the following ratings are based on 5 as best quality:  * sharpness: 4.5  * color: 4  * smooth: 4.54. actually the sound quality is not bad.5. the base allows to swivel which is convenientsome small issues:1. have to point the remote directly to the lower left corner of the TV to operate2. power cord is not detachable3. a bit hard to plug HDMI cable since the space is a bit narrow. I could not plug the chromecast stick directly to the TV, have to use the extension cable4. the packaging says: \"save all original packaging materials. warranty void if transported in other than original packaging\"5. can not find its manual pdf download on ocosmo official websiteoverall, this is a good buy.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV broke within 30 days", "Author": "Tara Reyna", "ReviewID": "R2DPDXG5PF43P3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I only had the TV for 30 days before it broke and I had to return it.
