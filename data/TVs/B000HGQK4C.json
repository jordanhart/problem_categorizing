{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The best 32\" LCD TV on the market", "Author": "Gene Kosobuski", "ReviewID": "R3ET0NUIEX5NWW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I conducted an extensive and exhaustive review of all 32\" LCD TVs currently available prior to making my TV selection.  I narrowed my choices to the following: the Panasonic TC-32LX60, the Samsung LN-S3251D, and the Sony KDL 32S2010.  All had excellent pictures, realistic color rendition and a fine balance between contrast and depth of black level.  I eliminated the Panasonic because it did not have a PC input port which I though long term would be something I would use more and more of.  Also the Panasonic did not have the quality depth of blacklevel the others had.  The Samsung was eliminated since the high gloss black cabinet finish reflected room lights and you could see window reflections as well. This became more and more of a distraction as I watched the TV since my eyes tended to be drawn to those reflections on the panel surrounding the screen. I ultimately decided to go with the latest 32\" Sony -- the KDL 32S2010 and can now report I am completely pleased with it.  One additional advantage of the Sony is that it has very easy to read, understand and navigate owner's manual.  Setting up the TV was a breeze.  As a final point, Amazon (via J&R;) had the best price on the TV of any online site.", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent 32\" LCD TV", "Author": "D. Acharya", "ReviewID": "R7VU21OX9XT43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was waiting for a long time for this TV to come to US market. It was introduced in the UK market few months back and my friends told me that it was an excellent TV. I did an extensive review of all 32\" LCD TVs currently available in the market before making my final selection. I narrowed down my choices to the following 2 TVS; Samsung LN-S3251D and the Sony KDL 32S2010. Both of these TVs have excellent pictures, realistic color rendition and a fine balance between contrast and depth of black level. Though look wise Samsung LN-3251D has an edge over KDL-32S2010 but KDL-32S2010 TV has much better sound quality than the LN-3251D. I own this TV for almost 2 months now and I am a quite satisfied customer. I just love its picture and sound quality. The picture quality is even better for HD channels.", "Date": "November 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "lots to love", "Author": "T. Cunningham", "ReviewID": "RE4E8TU0JKM10", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about a month now and it's terrific.  HD content is incredible, though like other LCDs standard definition TV doesn't look quite as good as on a regular tube TV.  I particularly like that all of the image properties are highly adjustable through the on-screen menus.  One of the reasons I bought this model was the PC (VGA D-sub) input, and it is great with my HTPC.  A drawback, I thought, is that there is only one HDMI input.  I bought a Sony upconverting DVD player at the same time to connect through HDMI, but discovered something odd.  When receiving an HD signal or when using the DVD player through HDMI, the TV chooses the \"zoom\" level and you can't change it.  I tried to play a DVD with a 4:3 image over HDMI and the TV stretched its width and I couldn't change it.  Also, DVD via HDMI is upscaled to 1080i while via component inputs it is 720p, so I went back to component for the DVD player, and the image quality is just as good.", "Date": "November 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Service Via Amazon", "Author": "Earl Johnson \"Hellooo\"", "ReviewID": "R27LNBWG4OZU49", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony LCD is a significantly well-designed package; however, this particular product should have included two connects for HDMI. While waiting for the adoption of HDTV to all locales and the obvious drop in price (currently being manipulated by the mainstay as \"premium,\" but will be mandated a standard in a couple of years), this LCD set works great and has excellent features for the price (plus it's a Sony).Another note I must mention is the fact that Amazon is simply amazing in regards to returns and replacement. We received the set and the top corner was cracked when we took it out of the box. Amazon was notified on-line and they responded via phone, set-up the replacement, and even had the time arranged for pick-up of the damaged set when the new one was delivered. Additionally, a confirmation e-mail was sent to me indicating that they received the returned item; simply excellent service from start to finish. This is the area in which MANY companies fail miserably - - - Amazon shines and receives 5 stars (*****).

Sony Bravia comes in 32\" and 40\", went with smaller, 32\" Bravia because of clarity and color - would rather have smaller Sony quality product than larger of other brands.  Great resolution. Easy to use out of box. Have had it for two months and are very happy with product. Only \"complaint\" is that when put on \"mute\" is does not close-caption.", "Date": "January 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent \"Mr. Sensible\" buy", "Author": "M. Cabrera", "ReviewID": "R2CX2E9CCJ9WOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those who want to test HDTV's out and want a good name with good backing and product quality, this line of LCD's is the way to go. Either your wife won't let you spend more than 1200+ dollars on a television or you want to see the difference at home before spending more, this is a great TV. I've noticed everyone says 32\" is too small for a living room, however, 6-8 ft is the recommended viewing distance for this HDTV size (which really makes a difference). So unless you sit further than 8 feet from your TV, this size is good for even a living room. I did not order from amazon, as shipping a TV is a little iffy to me, but the picture quality is great (HD.... regular TV, as with ALL HDTV's, looks worse than a normal TV, no matter which way you slice it or what type of connection you use). Thats really the only unfortunate drawback. But watching my HD channels and blu ray disks looks absolutely amazing. I've had this TV for over 2 months now, no dimming, spots, black corners, fading, or any visible reduction in picture quality yet as some other reviews stated. For those \"mr. sensible\" types who don't want to drop 8000 dollars on a 900 inch plasma 1080p, when in a year it will cost much less, this is a great \"tester\" you can move to the bedroom later.", "Date": "December 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Sony product, great Amazon service", "Author": "R. Heath", "ReviewID": "R2EKSK7JXXY5W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the Sony KDL-32S2010 from Amazon after seeing one in a friend's home and doing lots of research.  This is an excellent product. The price from Amazon was very good and the set was received on time in excellent condition.  I use a cable service and have found the HD channels are just superb.  Non-HD channels are very good if that channel is very good on your cable system.  Channels that are weak on cable look no better because the weakness is more obvious than on older sets due to the number of pixels on the screen. All digital channels look better than before. As an example in my case my cable system's AMC channel is excellent while the SciFi channel is weak. I also use a DVR from my cable company and combined with the Sony couldn't be happier. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this product.", "Date": "December 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "32 \" LCD HDTV", "Author": "R.

I was a little nervious about making a purchase of this amount online.  It worked out better then I expected.  I ordered the Sony due to having them in the past and they have always worked well for me.  This is just an amazing unit.  Everything is crystal clear.

Goonan \"see profile for URL\"", "ReviewID": "RQ9HNIQTC12UE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Sony TV lives up to all of the industry and Amazon reviews.  It is very attractive with any decor, easy to set up and can truly be viewed from almost any angle with excellent picture quality.  I would say it is ideal for a viewing distance of up to about 12-15 feet.  If you are going to view it at more than this distance, I would get a larger one.I didn't have any problems with ordering, shipping, etc.  The only negative I have to say is that the remote is not very rugged, which is surprising given the high ticket price.  Couldn't they put a few extra dollars and give people a nice remote.You definitely will not be disappointed with this TV for sporting events, correct rendering of flesh tones and adjusting to brightness within a room.  Compared to other HDTVs without all of these useful (sometimes essential) features, it's not an apples to apples comparison.  If you get one of the less expensive types, the color changes when viewed from an angle, the brightness isn't quite right, etc.  Spend the extra money and get something decent, a TV is generally something you will use for a long time.", "Date": "May 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Melvin R.

I had doubts about ordering something like this online, but have had no trouble at all, and counting tax, saved $300 over the Best Buy advertised sale price.

The picture is marvelous.  Two things prevent us from giving it 5 stars.  Jacks for surround sound so you can easily hook things up.  Easier navigating from video 1 through 7.  Maybe these things exist and as we read the manual in more depth we will find them, but they are not intuitively obvious.

I would have liked a little more ability to control some aspects like analog picture tuning.Switching TV/Video feature can be better than this -- at present one has to cycle through all the inputs to get to the desired one.I had some issue hooking up my Notebook to this TV through the S-video cable. But after some tries and a little googling I understood the difference between S-video connection and VGA connection. For S-video connection, I had to use the extended desktop feature of the Windows XP Operating system (actually, I had to move the window playing the video off to desktop beyond the right!).Overall, we all liked the TV for its picture clarity/brightness/sharpness (especially watching HD broadcasting).
