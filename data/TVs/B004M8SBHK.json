Roach", "ReviewID": "RTZ137UMRP6KC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: This is all personal opinion.There was Beta vs VHS...There is Mac vs Windows...And there is Plasma vs LCD/LED...Like Beta and Mac, Plasma is the higher quality technology. Like VHS and Windows, LCD/LED is the user-friendly norm. To each his/her own.I prefer Plasma.PROS:Less pixelation, faster refresh rate, less action-blur, 30 yrs life at 8 hours a day viewing, \"image burn-in\" almost nonexistent in newer models (would require MAJOR user-negligence, and it's a temporary effect anyway), on the average the sound quality is better/resonance, a more durable screen surface (better for people with pets who throw toys around and children who might push at the screen---ask your local dealer to knock his knuckles against a plasma screen and an LCD one, he won't knock on the LCD screen!), and unlike Macs though...\"plasmas\" are also the better technology BUT at the cheaper price. Life usually isn't that kind! The better product for the better price:-) Take advantage of it!NEUTRALS:Some might see the \"higher quality but cheaper price\" is a precursor to a technology that is being phased out of service (like the Beta tapes, or even Toshiba's HD-DVDs that eventually lost to Sony's Blu-Ray). That's understandable! But keep in mind, to my knowledge there are no LCD tv's beyond 65\" as the technology can't support it. Those \"enormo-screens\" like Jerry Jones' \"Everything is Bigger in Texas\" boob tubes are Plasmas! Plasmas aren't going away...CONS:Glare. Period. It IS an issue! The only issue. Personally, I think LCDs show their fair share of washed-out, hazy-glare at various angles anyway, but they still reign supreme in high light. Being a former glass-screen, tube-tv viewer...I don't find it any worse, but the \"glare is there\" so to speak. Can be \"mirror-like\" in the very worst cases. Blinds can solve the problem and setting the tv at a height of 4' or higher in room makes most sitting-angles, couches/tablechairs fine from window light. Still, it IS an issue.\"Plasma tvs run at a hot temperature and drain more energy.\" That's kind of out-dated. And the energy-draw is probably like $2 more a month. (Interesting sidenote...when choosing between the Panasonic and the Samsung, noticed the Samsung plasma screen felt rather warm whereas the Panasonic felt room temp.)CLOSING STATEMENT: Panasonic is/has been Plasma-industry leader since day 1...they've always focused on plasmas unlike Samsung, LG etc (not saying they're bad). Despite selling HDTV's a few years ago at a major chain, I just got my first HDTV a few weeks ago! Couldn't afford one until now. Always kept my eye on the Panasonic plasmas though and the Panasonic TC-P42X3 was worth the wait. I sit (using the old walking-foot count) ~12' away from my tv in an apartment living room w/ 2 larger windows. I'll take the better picture with some \"glare-issues\" in the morning then the lower quality picture with \"little glare\" issues anyday!ANY HDtv is better than the old CRTs (even though I loved them--\"pixelation\"?!? Who ever heard of \"pixelation\"?!!!), but I must confess this is a really good tv. I debated b/w a 1080p 32\" LCD and a 42\" 720p Pan plasma. Wanted great picture. Was afraid I was sitting too close to a 42\" at 12'. Not so. An old worker-associate steered me back in the right direction that was my gut instinct to begin with...a 42\" Panasonic Viera Plasma!

His commission was a pittance but his advice priceless.Hope this review helped...", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "X3: tv and wifi", "Author": "Jacques Antoine", "ReviewID": "R1RI8GHCQNKEQA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got a new X3 for a great price, and here's my experience.As a TV the X3 is excellent. I have it connected to a roof antenna, and the reception is excellent. It has a very good picture on hd broadcasts, and good also on sd broadcasts. The sound is good for a TV. The remote is a good size and easy to use. I could wish for a dedicated sleep-timer button, I suppose, but it's still a well-designed remote. Given that the current price on the 42\" X3 is comparable to a non-network TV, just for these virtues this set represents a great buy.If you want a wifi connection, you'll need a usb network adapter and there are apparently only two choices--the panasonic model DY-WL10 (~$90) or the cheaper Netgear WNDA3100 v2. There is some confusion about the Netgear, since it has to be the v2 and the serial number has to start with 2D4 or 20A (actually, it's really hard to tell the difference between these two sequences when the print is that small--maybe they're actually the same). These are sometimes identified on the package as being compatible with panasonic TVs. There is no particular reason to think the panasonic adapter is better than the netgear. I got both accidentally: the panasonic adapter can be easier to find, but I also found a used netgear on amazon without much difficulty for ~$20.But my experience trying to get a wifi connection has been frustrating, mainly because of a problem with my dsl modem/router. The setup procedure is simple and straightforward. But I had difficulties and worked through the procedure with a cs rep on the phone with no success. I am glad to report that the cs rep was patient and helpful, even though he couldn't solve my problem.Subsequently it became clear that my old modem/router was causing the trouble. It used the older \"G\" wifi protocol, but it was also prone to dropping the internet connection. So I needed to replace it in any event. Anyway, I got the latest \"N\" protocol modem/router compatible with my ISP. As soon as I set it up, the tv recognised the router's wifi signal with either the netgear or the panasonic wireless usb adapter. The reception of streaming videos is flawless--excellent picture and sound quality.Another option not quite as elegant as the tiny usb adapter is to configure a second wifi router to serve as a bridge. That would give you an ethernet connection you can place next to the TV, and as a bonus extend the range of your wifi throughout your house. There are lots of guides for how to do this online.Anyway, the result of all of this is that I've changed my rating to 5 stars for a truly excellent tv. Second, I'm returning the panasonic wireless adapter. The netgear works perfectly for less than a quarter of the price.I couldn't be happier with this tv now. But I would recommend making sure your router uses the \"N\" protocol. I'm not certain that this matters, but I haven't had any problems since I switched my router.Updated 3/26/2011", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful", "Author": "Jake B.", "ReviewID": "R183G6VZ591M1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this from Amazon for $694 and I got $10 off with a coupon I had plus the shipping was free and they brought it right up into my apartment so all I had to do was install it. The install is very simple just screw it into the stand, plug in all the wires and then there is an automated setup process so you just pick your options along the way.The stand feels very secure, it's a big black platform about 2'x1.5' with steal rods that go up inside the TV and screw in, there are 3 screws in each rod that connect it to the platform and 2 in each that connect it to the TV. I was able to do all that by myself but just barely and I'm a pretty big guy so considering the size and weight of the TV it should be at least a 2 man job.If you get the version with the built in Ethernet adapter you can connect to your Netflix, Pandora, Napster and a number of other sites to watch or listen to whatever you want.Then of course the inputs, 2 HDMI, an SD Card reader, 1xRCA and 1xRCAHD, of course read the specs carefully because there are different versions of this same TV (i.e. one version with an Ethernet adapter and 1 without and there might be one that is also 3D ready but it might be more expensive then the one I'm reviewing)The color and picture are beautiful, I play a lot of video games so picture quality was important to me, if you're a gamer this TV is for you. I play halo on Xbox 360 and one of my biggest issues was ghosting (when you look around too quickly and everything blurs) with this TV that issue is almost completely taken care of, there is still some blur but it's extremely mild.As for the picture quality being 720p...well there a lot of people who will say a lot of stuff when it comes to the differences between 720p, 1080p, 720i and 1080i and I can only speak from experience but I do have a 23\" computer monitor that is 1080p and I tried to play the same things on there that I did on the TV (and I have a very good computer with a high end graphics card) and yes I know it isn't a perfect test but it's the best I could do and from what I could tell there was very little difference. So in my opinion for the size, quality and price it's a very good deal.The only real problem with it that I've noticed so far is that if you get too close things look...grainy almost like you can see black spots everywhere on it however if you are even 1ft away you can't see them at all and considering it's 50\" I hope you're sitting at least 1ft away lol.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW!! What a difference!!", "Author": "Jason Bliss \"Mazuko\"", "ReviewID": "R1APK4EF6PB9LW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to get my hands on this TV for $499.99 at best buy last week and let me tell you I am more than impressed.I will first mention that I upgraded from a 32\" RCA CRT TV to this so my differences are much larger than most who upgrade from an older LCD/Plasma TV.The picture quality is amazing, very clear, crisp, and bright.  It has several \"display\" options that change the brightness and contrast with the push of a button that helps to keep you from having to adjust them yourself regularly and depending on what equipment you hook up to the TV.I will not go into detail about all of the features this TV has but I will mention that I REFUSE to pay $100 for a wireless adapter for a TV so I purchased the netgear WNDA3100v2 and it worked perfectly out of the box.  The TV detected it right away (make sure you plug this into USB1 NOT USB2), and once I put in my network key I was able to connect to everything listed.As for DLNA, I noticed a reviewer gave this TV 1 star because they could not connect to DLNA.  On this note the easiest way to set this up it to add your entire library to windows media player as that is how the TV streams your files to itself.  Once I set up my library this way I was able to steam ALL of my Music, Movies, and Photo's to my TV with no issues at all.  In fact it works so well, and supports so many different formats that I will now be selling off my WD TV Live Plus as this TV does everything that it does.The screen definitely reflects everything that has light shining but that is a downfall of all Plasma TV's.  However the picture quality is great and the sound is actually better than that of my old TV.  Sure surround sound would be better but our TV is less than 6' away from the couch so the speakers on this TV are more than adequate and they actually sound pretty good once you configure them to your liking via the easy to use menu system.For those of you that are upset with the limit of composite and rca inputs I would recommend purchasing a switch and there is no issues (these can be had for around $10 on ebay).  Thusly I have the following connected to this TV:Microsoft Xbox 360 via componentstandard dvd player, Nintendo Wii, wd tv live, VHS player, and a Zune 120GB all via RCA + switchVerizon FiOS Set Top Box via coaxBlue-Ray DVD player via HDMISony Playstation 3 via HDMI(For FiOS you still need to use Verizon's remote as there is no point getting rid of the remote that comes with this TV, there is just so many buttons NOT supported on the FiOS remote that you need to keep the one that comes with the TV, so I use Verizon's remote for my channel surfing and the Panasonic remote for everything else.)Everything looks great and it is very easy to switch between inputs by pressing, you guessed it, the input button.  This TV supports 5 inputs with said button, if you use the switch just switch it to RCA and you can than use the selector switch on your unit to select the others.All in all a very good TV, with good sound, and good picture quality.  At $500 you can't go wrong and this TV is a perfect fit for me.The only major draw back once you get the wireless set up and configure your DLNA correctly, is the screen glare, and that can be easily fixed by closing the blinds.  The minor glare you get is common to any glass surface and is ultimately negligible.I highly recommend this TV!!", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great plasma display", "Author": "techmannn \"techmannn\"", "ReviewID": "RVG127LPB3CZI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd Panasonic plasma display and the quality of the picture is absolutely great.  This TV gets 4 stars because the display has a glossy finish and not a matte finish.  This matters in any room that has windows or lamps.  You'll see the reflection of these light sources on the TV screen.  Honestly I have no idea why anyone would want a glossy screen over a matte screen.This is a 720p resolution TV, which is why the price seems low for a 50 inch TV.  1080p sounds great but in reality most folks are not watching _true_ 1080p content.  Even with a lot of bluray content, the original content was a lower resolution (often DVD 480p) and it was simply rescanned into 1080p for the bluray disk.

Netflix, kinda takes long to load your Instant Queue, but well I have like 100 movies in my queue so it might be just me ^_^ , HD TV on Netflix looked quite good, we saw a movie and it was great, one point I did not like at all, is that it has no option to set the Netflix subtitles, really, that's a big fail, and I hope it gets fixed soon, Netflix will have subtitles for 80% of it's content, very soon and really a TV as new as this should have subtitles enabled.. or a way to enable them ( maybe I have not find, it ), And about the other internet apps, I have not tested them.One thing I will test soooon is to see if it can turn off the screen playing audio so you can only use it like a big stereo system I hope it does that.Power Management.It is Epa compatible but I have not found anywhere how much energy it uses so I would like to know that, I find the power management controls a bit stiff, it only has: Turn, off after 10 minutes of no signal and turn off after 3 hours of no activity, I want to costumize that.. I want to super save :S , but still maybe I have not found where to change that, but so far I only have those 2 options :SDNLAI just plugged it, selected DNLA, placed my phone on Allshare and voila, I could see all my pictures, music and video from my phone on my TV, GREAT, it also saw my main DNLA server of my main PC and the one of the HTPC, I failed playing some MP4 content, but it saw the Mp3s, avis, and JPG fine, so really it worked good. sine I already had a working DNLA setup, it just came and recognized it all.USB playbackI have NOT tested this. ( I have to )TV reception:No idea I have my cable connected to my HTPC, but I'm gonna get a signal splitter to see how it detects the QAM channels :DPet peeveThis is not a problem of the TV but it's something that all plasma TVs have, the surface is so glossy it's like a mirror and it is a bit distracting from time to time, just reduce the light and it goes away but, I don't particularly like it.Overall I really like this TV for the price is an excellent choice, 600$ or less and get netflix ( a roku is like 100$ ) DNLA support, facebook, crisp images, no artifacts, good sound, I had no idea it could be this good for so little money !

Overall, for the price of the TV and size (50'), you can't get much better then this.  I own another Panasonic Plasma (400U) and to compare picture quality, pretty much on par.  The fact its 720p really makes no difference IMO.  I play Blu Ray movies and unless you are completely picky about minute subtle differences, you really can't tell a difference.  I have not yet had a chance to hook up this TV to my network for use with Netflix, but I have used my laptop with Netflix via HDMI and the quality of video is decent.  My only \"issues\" with the TV is there is a slight glare I can notice at times.  However, this is somewhat dependent on the location of my TV in the room with light and windows.  My other \"knock\" is the sound quality compared to my other older Panasonic.  My 400U Panasonic had amazing sound and I was hoping for similar sound with this TV.  Now, I'm not saying the sound is bad, but it doesn't compare to my older model.  It is still good (7 out of 10) versus (10 out of 10) of the other.

Panasonics do the important thing right in this price range.  They get you a decent picture.But they are a bit short on features.  And this may come back to bite you in the longer run.  So check carefully.One big feature missing is no analog stereo (normal rca cable) output.For those that are thinking of just hooking up a some simple powered speakers to this tV to enhance the sound you might want to think twice.If you have a big AV receiver already (a newer one) or a sound bar or sound system with optical input then most likely no worries.But personally I wanted to add a nice sounding & simple yet inexpensive Harman Kardon SoundSticks system to mine, but was thwarted because of the optical sound output.You can get around this with a decoding/conversion device (DAC aka Digital to Analog Converter.)  But then you're shelling out more $$$$. ($50-$60 for a simple DAC or closer to $100 for one that decodes DD 5.1) Also they require a plug-in.  And cheaper ones can be noisy.Can't believe they don't put this seemingly simple inexpensive  standard feature on this tv.  Many buying this tv aren't going to have nice av receivers imo.

I own a few LCD's for the other rooms of the house, and immediately the vibrant color renderings and refresh rate become an obvious difference.  I have always read that plasma televisions were ideal for sports and movies with fast moving sequences and now owning one i see why.  The deeper black levels, the 600hz refresh rate, internet connectivity, and oh yes, the price point, make this Panasonic a bargain well worth looking at.  The display does reflect surfaces more than the LCD screen so glare is an issue if placed facing a window, however that is a minimal issue that dark curtains or blinds can resolve.  Plasma televisions also consume more power, however with advances in technology that gap has closed a bit, as is the case with this set.  For being a plasma and a 46\" one at that, it is no power hog.  It is only a 720p display, however when mated to HD sources the difference between 720p and 1080p is negligible at this screen size.  If you are in the market for a budget minded yet feature abundant set, look no further.  Streams services such as Netflix with fantastic picture quality.

A line's minimum true size is the pixel size.  This tv is 1024x768, and while 768 is greater than 720, the vertical dimension of broadcast 720p is 1280.  So the vertical resolution is missing 256 pixels needed to do 1:1 pixels-to-signal ratio.  On the vertical dimension, 4 pixels must produce a resolution of the signal intended for 5 pixels.You can simulate this in reverse by changing your computer screen resolution to something other than its native setting. If your monitor's native resolution is 1280x1024, change it to 1024x768, or any setting lower than native.  Your screen will now be slightly blurry; intricate detail in images will look fuzzy along sharp edge contrasts.  But if you back up 6 feet or so, it is very difficult to detect this blurriness.If you go to a big box retailer and compare this tv to its 1080p counterpart in the Panasonic line, you will notice the jagged edge effect on lines and sharp contrasts.

These were the same connections that I used successfully on a Sony TV for three years.  I worked fine for two weeks and then it stopped.  I called Panasonic Service and they sent out a repair crew (from Tampa..a 200 mile round trip instead of using a local repair firm) and they told me that the main board had burned out.  They said that Panasonic would send the replacement board to me and when I got it to call them and they would come back to install it...which they did.One week later the main board burned out again.  Now Panasonic has the nerve to tell me that it is my TIVO unit that is burning out the boards.  They say that it is very common for any cable box or satellite receiver to burn out HDMI sockets.  They said that they would replace the board this time but my warranty would be void after that.  I was told to call a local repair company for service.  The new company came and picked up my set to repair.  They called me a week later and told me that Panasonic had changed their mind and would not pay for the repair and if I wanted it done it would cost me almost $400.  I told them not to do the repair and they said that I still owed them $60.  I will pay them the $60 just for the satisfaction on taking a hammer to that piece of junk.In the mean time I had hooked up a 32\" Sanyo that I moved from our kitchen with the same connections and again they worked fine.  They are still working fine today.  The problem is NOT with my TIVO unit.  The problem is with the Panasonic set...and with Panasonic employees.My advice....stay away from Panasonic products.

I have to give the edge to my Vizio LCD in screen brightness though, but not by much.The 600hz refresh rate makes this TV smooth as all get out for watching sports and for video games, though I admit that I can't really tell the difference past 240hz.Glare is an issue with this TV and indeed most plasmas. This TV is bright enough to still perform well in a room with some windows, but it really gets good in a dim room. This isn't a set for your sun-room. If you try to watch this tv with a strong light-source directly behind your head, you're gonna have a bad time.But if you're like me and this is going in a room where bright light is not a concern, the picture quality of this TV is off the charts good. Panasonic makes a darn good plasma. I would say only surpassed by full-array LED sets (not the \"edge-lit\" LED tv's.,. know the difference before buying!) and full-array LED's are a whole other price range.Oh and for those concerned about the 720p resolution, it's really hard to tell the difference on a 50\" set. It's kind of like a digital photo. A 10 megapixel image can only be blown up to a certain size before it starts to look pixelated. Well, with 720p video, that size limit is about 50\".

I also didn't like the digital-only audio output to use with external sound, but I did buy the Fiio D3 (from Amazon) Optical-to-Analog converter and it's good to go....minus the inability to control the volume through the TV.

Panasonic has very few bad reviews compared with good reviews. Anybody can get a stinker, that's why there's always a 1 year warranty. My main decision when buying an HDTV that rarely gets any attention is the ability to adjust the picture format. Many cheaper brands do not have this option.

I didn't get to do alot of research as the store I bought it from did not have much to choose from in the 42\" category (I'm limited by size requirements sadly) but since they price-matched best buy and dropped the sales tax, I figured 5 bills was not a bad deal for it. I'm not going to get into technical specifics or the pros/cons of having a plasma vs LCD as other reviews have already covered that ad naseum. What I will comment on is the couple of things I noticed during setup that you may want to consider before buying it: 1) Haven't messed much with newer TVs lately but this plasma is a helluva lot lighter than my last one. I needed a hand getting it out of the box but was able to mount it to my corner entertainment center (the ones with the swivel arm thingy) by myself which was nice. 2) Like with most newer TVs, this one has no RCA audio output jacks--only optical. May not be a big deal for most of you but for us with an ancient RCA-input only reciever, it means we'll either have to live with the TV speakers *shudder*, upgrade your reciever, or buy a digital-to-analog converter. 3) There are no mounting bolts on the back of the TV (they are actually little black plastic plugs) so if you don't already have some M8 metric bolts for your mounting setup, you'll have to go to home depot and try to find them *shudder again*. 4) And not sure if this last one is just me and I love the remote that came with the TV but for some reason I cannot get my \"learning\" remote to learn the buttons off of it. This is nothing major, just don't like having to fumble around with multiple remotes. Other than that, the picture quality for TV, PS3, and Blu-ray is on par with my last plasma so I can't complain there.

The delivery service dropped it off, and I could tell the item had been repackaged (which I expected).  Once set up however, the item looked brand new.  I found no scuffs, scratches, or even finger prints on the television.  I would have assumed it to be brand new.  The set itself was very easy to set up, and even though it comes with a fairly thick manual, I found that it was easy enough to find the items of interest to us (e.g. we could skip sections on how to view photos through a usb drive, etc, and get right to things that mattered to us like adjusting the picture and using the remote).  We had it hooked up to a DVD, Wii, and external sound system in about 10 minutes.  The onscreen controls are very easy to understand, and the remote is intuitive.  I found it easier to understand than our 10 year old TV with inscrutable on screen menu's and symbols.Three things I really liked:1. The inputs can be renamed.  So if you hook your DVD up to the RCA Video input, you can label it as \"DVD\" so that in your onscreen menu it says what it is.  Same for the Wii, etc.  So when you change inputs there is no more trying to figure out what \"Line 1\" and \"Line 2\" etc point to.2. If you either purchase a wi-fi adapter that hooks into the TV, or (as we did) run an ethernet cable to your router, you can access the built in apps for pandora, facebook, netflix, etc.  One important note, although the product description does not say so, Amazon Instant Video is an included app, so you can watch streaming movies from netflix or amazon from your tv, once you have the TV hooked up to your network.3. Adjusting the picture is very straightforward, and you can name multiple presets.  So you can configure the brightness and contrast etc for gaming, and save that as \"gaming\" and another for movies, or black and white, etc.  Then is is very easy to flip back and forth between them.  The TV comes preset with a couple of these, and the ability to add more.  You can reset to factory default too, if you feel like you screwed it all up.  I found the picture to be perfect out of the box, but we did us the presets for gaming (brighter) and cinema.Overall, I am very happy with the picture.  It looks perfect to my eye. I cant say much about the technical specifications, as I judged it the old fashioned way.  I just looked at the picture with some fast action stuff (sports), animation, and black and white film.  Looked great to me.  I have seen other larger screens that look pixelated or just sort of hurt to look at.  No issue here.

The picture is bright enough for daytime viewing. At night the picture is stunning. Even though it is only 720p I have no complaints. The only problem is going from my new TV and new Panasonic blue-ray to my old sound system. I get a low frequency annoying buzz now that drives me nuts. They have RCA analog out on the blue-ray but not the TV. I am going to try a digital link and see if that helps. My old receiver does not have a hdmi and I am not really ready to upgrade my once top of the line Denon.... I'm pretty sure the sound issue is just a problem with my setup, the tv actually sounds pretty decent after playing with the sound settings. I will update once I figure it out. Overall for the price and bang for the buck, you can't beat the plasma. If money was no object I would spend the extra 2k for a high end led/lcd for a real bright room. Then again even if money was no object I don't generally stay inside watching TV when the sun is shining.Update!!! The audio buzz was eliminated by the optical digital audio link added from my Panasonic Blue -ray to the old Denon. Luckily the blue-ray player I bought had this output, not all of them do.

There are different picture modes to try, but I adjusted the default mode to closer match my tube TV, and was much happier. The set also has an ambient light sensor to darken the picture in low light. While a good idea in practice, it tends to make white objects (and the overall picture) grayish.

I looked at both LCD/LED and plasmas.In my case, the 720P/1080P resolution didn't play a factor because I knew I couldn't tell the difference for my viewing distance. Also, since glare from windows/lights would not be an issue for me, the decision came down to buy the best plasma TV with the qualities mentioned above.This plasma delivers outstanding vibrate colors, as good as or better than any LCD/LED I viewed in the stores. I set the saturation, brightness, etc. to 75(out of 100) and the color is brillant! While there is no professional calibration menu, the standard color management menu is definitely fine for most everyone.When choosing a plasma, the thing I was most worried about(image retention/burn) turned out to be a non-issue.I've watched 100s of hours of television(with black bars) and played hours of video games, all with no hint of image burn, ghosting, or image memory of any kind. This TV does have an auto screen saver, but the current plasma technology make image retention a thing of the past.The picture resolution is sharp and the HD is great for football games. From about a 10ft viewing distance, bluray movies and OTA HD broadcasts are absolutely crisp!I love using the SD card slot for viewing photos and movies.In my opinion, I believe the sound is very good. I only have to set the sound at 40-50(out of 100) and it has plenty of power from 10ft away.The only slight negative is that the NetFlix Application that comes with the Viera online content doesn't have a very user friendly interface.As far as price goes, I paid 5 C-notes for a 50\" plasma, so I believe I got a great deal.Pros:- Picture quality is crisp and vibrant.- Excellent price- Great sound- Lots of inputs including SD card slot- Can attach an ethernet cable for online content- Industry-leading manufacturer- Sturdy standCons:- Internet Apps are few, NetFlix UI good be better- Glare could be a problem, but wasn't for me(don't have the tv facing a large picture window)All in all, Panasonic makes an excellent plasma TV.

Has worked great from day one and still think it looks a lot better than a LCD or LED.  When programs are in HD the picture is incredible.  I combined it with a Blueray player and even my DVDs look great on the Blueray player.  The only down side is WiFi availability.  The TV did not come with it.  I read about problems with the WiFi receiver you could buy for this TV and decided not to buy it.  I hooked it up to my modem with an Ethernet cable and have not looked back.  Yes the glare can be a problem with many widows in the room, but I have been able to close the blinds and can live with that problem.Would I buy this TV again?

After that 4 more screws to secure the TV to the mounts and you are ready to go. Setup on the TV is self explanitory and only takes 2 or 3 minutes.

This TV (and perhaps all plasmas) have a mirror-like surface. That means light sources directly in front of the TV will reflect onto the surface of the TV. Light from a window will reflect onto the screen and be annoying during the day. Night-time viewing is better, although any lights/lamps will be visible and invade your picture too. It just won't be as annoying as day-time TV viewing. These problems will be most pronounced when the TV is displaying black and grey colors.Beyond that, the 720p picture is satisfactory. The TV represents a good value for the budget-minded who don't want to pay for the reportedly (per Cnet review) minor difference between 720p and 1080p.

We have no trouble accessing Netflix on other devices in the home (Roku box, computers), so the issue clearly is a Panasonic one. Panasonic tech support initially told us this was a Netflix issue. Further investigation demonstrated that this was not the case. Panasonic collected all of our information and thus far we have heard nothing.In summary: if you don't care about accessing Netflix through this TV, it's a great choice.P.S.

First it is advertised as wi-fi ready but it is not.  You must purchase a $90 wi-fi adapter to get wi-fi to work.  You can buy a Roku HD box for that money that has MUCH better web apps. The web apps are only Netflix, Amazon, Pandora, Hulu and a couple lesser know pay movie channels. Secondly, the resolution is not 720P as advertised.  The resolution is 768x1024 not 720x1280.  Because of its large size and lower resolution you need to get about 8 feet away or more before the picture looks really good and the pixelation disappears.  When you do get that distance the picture is pretty nice.I was a sad to see that burn in can be a problem if you view 3x4 programs with sidebars.  This is stated on the inside cover of the manual.  Since you can not adjust the format of the screen when in the web tools this is going to be a problem.  There is also a fair amount of glare from the screen.I was excited to see that the TV has USB and SD card input that plays MP4 movies.  Unfortunately this is a letdown.  About half my movies are out of sync between picture and sound so they are unwatchable.  My Sony and Roku boxes play the MP4s without issue.  The DLNA feature also does not seem to work though DLNA works fine with my Sony.  It recognizes my PC but will not connect.  This might be a configuration issue but it is not clear.  The USB drive also does not have enough power to run a portable drive like my WD passport.For me I bought this TV to have a large web-enabled TV for my basement that played MP4 movies.  It fell short for me.  Make sure you can return this TV in case you don't like it.  Perhaps for you it will be fine but it is too big and heavy and does not deliver all it advertises for me.These issues aside the picture is very nice from greater than 8 feet.  The colors are very good and the I don't see banding.  I do see jagged lines because of pixelation but it isn't terrible.  If you plan on viewing from a distance the picture is very good but if you sit closer it is worth paying for a 1080 model.  Even on lower resolution input I prefer the way 1080 models upscale.  I upgraded my rating from 2 to 3 after watching broadcast TV for a while.  I think most of the display problems I originally saw were from the source material and not the TV.
