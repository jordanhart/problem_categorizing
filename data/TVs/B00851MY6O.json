It's an excelent tv with good picture and sound.  Being a gamer that has switched from a standard LCD tv to this LED tv I've had the minor inconvenience of switching the brightness and contrast settings on all of my games.  Oh, but it is worth it!  In games I could hardly make out features in dark areas are now clear as crystal.  The best news is the picture settings are saved seperately for each input.This tv does not use front facing speakers.  Especialy for someone who watches the news like me it sounded muffled.  I customized the settings a bit and now it's perfect.  The SRS TruSurround feature makes things sound clearer an in proper proportion.  This tv also does not emit much heat at all.Overall I'd give this high marks for the price I paid for.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good Picture and Sound", "Author": "JAS32 \"jas32\"", "ReviewID": "R1IVD8SHP61OHF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was trying to save a few bucks getting a new 32 inch TV and initially bought a Westinghouse UW32SC1W from Costco.  What a big mistake!  I ended up returning it and getting this Samsung unit instead for a few more dollars.  That turned out to be a good move since this one has great picture and decent sound, something missing from the Westinghouse even after 3 days of endless adjustments.  With this Samsung, I got the picture and the sound to my liking with very minimal adjustment from the default setting.One neat feature of this TV is the very narrow frame and a short stand.  It fits in the same spot where I previously had a 26 inch TV.  It is a bit thicker than typical LED sets (similar to LCD units), maybe because it is a back-lit version not the newer edge-lit models.  Although it is quite a bit lighter, compared to my older LCD 26 inch unit.The viewing angle is a bit narrower than I wanted, so if you are looking for a set with a wide viewing angle, you may want to check it out in a store before you buy one.The joystick control on the bottom right side takes some getting used to but it is much better than other TVs which sometimes only comes with just an on-off switch.Overall, it is an excellent buy and appears to be a quality built set delivering very good picture and sound.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great TV at a great price", "Author": "Adam B.

The picture is crisp and clear, the sound is far better than I was expecting from such a thin device, and it also works great as an external monitor. We have no complaints whatsoever and are very happy with our purchase.We bought this from Costco for $289, so shop around for the best price before buying it here.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "NICE!", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R1BM3UV6PDYETM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with the TV. This was my second purchase to get a flat screen. I ordered my first Samsung from another online retailer, but I think there was something wrong with it. The audio was horrible and the picture was a bit pixelized. It was very disappointing because all the online reviews were glowing and it was the top rated TV. I called Samsung and they couldn't really help me resolve the audio issues which lead me to believe there was something wrong with it. I upgraded to this model because it allows output for a Home Theater System, HTS, just in case the audio was bad on the replacement model too. As it turns out, I hooked it up, and it was great, no need to run the audio through the HTS. I'm very happy with it, and the High Definition channels are unbelievable. The detail is so sharp that it almost hurts your eyes to watch. So, if you get this set and it's not perfect, something's wrong. It shouldn't disappoint.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best For TV for the price!", "Author": "Annoymous", "ReviewID": "R11MM3U092T07I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shopped and reviewed about a dozen of 32\" LED TVs for a couple ofweeks as a hobby before buying the UN32EH4050 to replace my 4 yearold Samsung 23\" LCD TV. Big shocking differences in size andclarity. 32\" was much better. Technology moves to make thingsbetter.I chose the UN32EH4050 after all reviewers gave it the highestmarks.I have to concur and give this TV 5 stars.The picture is just fantastic. I was going to shell out anadditional $200 to upgrade to the 5000 series but most of the peoplewho tried out the 5000 said that it was not that important to theirviewing even with 1080p since most broadcast are still in 720p or1080i. A few programs are in 1080p but you need a digital antenna toget them. So I will wait a few years more; to get a 4Kp. Of course,heavy Blu-Ray users might want to go to the 5000 series.The sound is marvelous with 10 watts per channel. Double that foundin most 32\" TVs.The only con I found is that it has only two HDMI and it located onthe right side of the TV. I love to have it located in the centerside so the wires are hidden from view. It should have 3 HDMIs.One for DVD player, Internet access - Roku box and one for otherdevices.The TV bottom is not leveled so I had to build a custom enclosurefor it to lay flat on the counter. That took some design work but itwas easy to build and complete. Could not use the Samsung standsince it would make the height too high.  My 23\" Samsung was usedwithout the stand too but it has a flat bottom to it and thespeakers were on the front sides.All of my other TVs are ultrathin bezels too and this one is thethinnest yet. Reduce space needs to make a perfect fit in my kitchenat (17.5\" with custom enclosure) because of it.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Great Set If You Can Still Find It", "Author": "Lsqud \"Lsqud\"", "ReviewID": "R3P1SDLA2J2PQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched 32 inch Tv's for a while and finally decided that I wanted this model, my problem was that it was the end of the model year and I couldn't find anyone that still had this model.  Thankfully Amazon still had 3 in stock and they were priced at a very attractive price, even after shipping was added on.The TV works even better than I hoped--it is very clear and sharp.  If there is anything I am unhappy with it is the fact that the volume, even at maximum, is not as loud as most other TV sets.  This may be a minor problem to some but to me it is nothing to worry about since I run the sets volume through my stereo; that way the sound is extra high quality and the volume is never an issue.I would recommend this set to anyone looking for a 32 inch.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just about perfect", "Author": "John D.

As a perfectionist, picture and sound are extremely important to me, and this Samsung certainly delivers on that front. My only complaint would have to be the remote control - could be a little easier to read for us seniors.I bought Samsung because I've had great success with other Samsung products (DVD and Laser Printer). I am quite brand-loyal, and usually buy Panasonic TV's, but I now believe the Koreans are ahead in the electronics race. I did order a Sony Blu Ray to replace that Samsung DVD player - just thought that unit to be the state of the art right now.Thank you Amazon.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice television", "Author": "rja44081", "ReviewID": "R3CDXGP04FG85Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I always have luck with Samsung brands and this television is no exception.

Greenwood", "ReviewID": "R2H3EVV1P6PDX9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We purchased this from another vendor, and it worked so great that we ended up purchasing a similar model from Amazon.Then, after about 10 months a blue vertical line appeared down the middle of the screen.  Since it was still under warranty, we sent it in for service. (Yes, since it's smaller than 37\", you actually have to send it.)Samsung called a couple of days later to tell me there was a \"small\" scratch on the display, so they were voiding the warranty. I'm pretty positive there was no scratch when I sent it, but since I had to mail it (UPS) instead of actually handing it to someone (because I'm sure there are no capable repair shops in Atlanta), there's no way to prove whether it was already there, if it was a problem in shipping, or if they did it upon receipt. They did offer to do an out-of-warranty replacement for only $80 more than I paid for the tv in the first place. (Gee, thanks.) Since I knew I was going to get nowhere with them, I told them to just send it back.When I got the tv back, the display was destroyed. It looks like the layers of the display are completely separated/cracked. I called Samsung and they told me to put in a claim w/ UPS. When I told them that I expected that UPS would reject the claim because of the poor return packaging, I was told that Samsung wouldn't do anything for me because the tv was considered out of warranty due to what I was repeatedly told was a SMALL scratch (which I'm pretty certain had nothing to do with that original blue line problem anyway).So, now  I've gone from having a tv with a small blue line through the display to having a useless brick.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "After jumping through hoops, the TV works fine", "Author": "computer mom", "ReviewID": "RD02RN4F60OIG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my TV on sale at Costco.  Out of the box, the TV was terrible.  The print on the screen was blurry with a shadow & totally unreadable.  The faces were also blurry.  I tried making some picture calibrations on my own, but it still wasn't viewable.  Then I found a website by searching on calibrate samsung hdtv, made the suggested changes & the picture is now very good.  There is a button under the TV which allows you to operate the TV without using the remote.  It involves making selections on an on-screen function menu by pressing on the sides of the button.  It is definitely not user friendly.  Separate buttons would work better.  I am not using the TV as a computer monitor, so I have no insights to offer on that.  I am giving the TV 4 stars because of the hours I spent trying to make it watchable.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't take any abuse", "Author": "Saddened and poorer", "ReviewID": "RC4FBAPJO2302", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well, we liked it...for the whole three months we had it. It seemed like a good buy for a family on a tight budget who doesn't spend much time in front of the tv. BUT...If you have children, this tv is not for you unless you can mount it behind bullet-proof glass. I had heard stories about Wii controls breaking the tvs. But, I had no idea that one hit from a toy by a two-year old would render it completely useless. I imagined that maybe the screen would get scratched or something of the like. But the image goes completely black and can never be fixed unless you want to fork out 85% of the actual cost of the tv. Seriously, I will not buy another one until they can make it in a more durable material.
