{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Comments Actually Pertaining to this Specific TV Model", "Author": "W", "ReviewID": "R22QC4CEUGRNIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to buy LG's (well-reviewed) 42LK520 at the exact time it was discontinued and no longer available. That's what I get for procrastinating. The replacement for 2011's 42LK520 is 2012's 42CS570. On paper, the basic specifications are almost the same as the 42LK520. Since new-model reviews aren't available yet, I had no reason to not get the 42CS570 given the similarities.The owner's manual available from LG's support website details the inputs, outputs, and menu options available on the TV. The manual appears to be accurate and only covers the 42CS570 and 47CS570 models (ie - not too much \"depends on model\" content). Specifications are finally up on LG's product page, though they still have some errors. For instance, they only list one rear AV input. In fact, there is also a second, side AV input.The 42CS570 is a 42-inch, 1080P, 120Hz, LCD TV listed for $699.99. The screen has a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 150,000:1 contrast ratio. On the rear panel, there are 2 HDMI, 2 Component, 1 AV (Composite), 1 RGB (PC), 1 Antenna / Cable (RF), and 1 Audio (RGB / DVI) inputs, with 1 Optical Audio output. On the side panel, there are: 1 USB, 1 HDMI, and 1 AV (Composite) inputs, with 1 Headphone Audio output. The channel, volume, and other controls are touch-sensitive areas on the front of the TV.The TruMotion menu option has two components: De-Judder and De-Blur. Both components take a value between 0 and 10. There are three pre-set options: Off (0, 0), Low (3, 3), High (7, 7). A fourth option, User, allows for either component to be set to preference. The TV comes with a power-saving / screen-dimming feature turned On. At night, I actually thought this was sort of nice. During the day I turned the feature Off. Otherwise, I thought the picture settings out-of-the-box were actually pretty good. Setup was quick and easy.According to an online source, the TV (like LG's other 1080P models) has only IPS panels. My TV has the following product code: 42CS570-UD-AUSYLUR. Other online sources stated that the \"Y\" in the 4th-from-right position indicates an IPS panel.The shipping dimensions (W x H x D) are roughly: 48 inches x 30 inches x 6 inches.I replaced an old 32-inch Panasonic CRT TV. So, obviously this LG HD TV is a noticeable upgrade. That said, I can't really comment on how the screen or engine compares to other HD TVs. I'm receiving over-the-air HD channels through a cheap, GE indoor antenna I've had for years, similar to the 24731. I have my Wii connected through a Monoprice Composite cable. Through a Monoprice HDMI cable, I'm running a Panasonic DMP-BDT220 Blu-ray player I purchased for Blu-ray content, streaming content, and miscellaneous content I have on my Synology DS211J NAS acting as a DLNA server. Just for giggles, I also ran a 25-foot Monoprice VGA cable (with audio) from my laptop to the TV. Everything works as well as expected. Picture is great for all uses. Sound is good as well. With realistic expectations, I haven't run into anything to complain about yet.If you have other hardware to handle \"smart\" services, or just don't care for those services, and don't care to be on the cutting edge of 3D and LED panels, this is an ideal TV. As a 1080P, 120Hz TV with a good set of inputs, this is a quality HD TV that lists for $100 less than last year's nearly identical model.Obviously, I can't comment on the device's longevity. I've run plenty of test scenarios, but I've only had it for a few days. Time will tell. Advertised warranty is 1 year parts, 1 year labor.For the record, I wanted nothing to do with 3D. I had to consider screen glare. I felt a 42-inch TV best fit my living room layout and I had a budget to meet. For my budget, I preferred 120Hz LCD over 60Hz LED-LCD and I preferred 1080P LCD over 720P plasma. Compare to other 42-inch LG models for price and features.42LM6200 = 42-inch, 3D, 1080P, 120Hz, Smart, LED-LCD TV listed for $1,299.9942LM5800 = 42-inch, 3D, 1080P, 120Hz, LED-LCD (not yet available)42LS5700 = 42-inch, 1080P, 120Hz, Smart, LED-LCD TV listed for $1,099.9942LS3400 = 42-inch, 1080P, 60Hz, LED-LCD TV listed for $719.9942CS560 = 42-inch, 1080P, 60Hz, LCD TV listed for $629.9942PM4700 = 42-inch, 3D, 720P, 600Hz, Smart, plasma TV listed for $699.9942PA4500 = 42-inch, 720P, 600Hz, plasma TV listed for $549.99", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Tommy J", "ReviewID": "RYVHQGI08NFNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I finally broke down and bought an LCD tv. After studying LCDs for about a year. I decided against WIFI in a tv. The problem is keeping a wifi tv updated with current apps. It seems that due to models rapid changes that most TV companies do not wish to spend the resources to keep old models (probably discontinued) updated. So the best option is to save the money abd add a Roku to handle the wifi apps. Roku automatically updates as necessary. I have had a Roku for a few years and they are rock solid.I have presently an old 37 tube type tv. It has been a good tv but it is hopelessly outdated. Now the only problem I have is getting someone to remove it (it weighs a ton) and dispose of it. It still works but it is not a digital tv (got to have the \"box\" for conversion) or in my case Direct TV..I also, didn't want a 3D TV. 1. I get headaches watching a neighbor's 3D. 2. 3D movies (mostly cartoons)are hokey expensive refurbs (~30-50 bucks). 3. The glasses are expensive. Also, I didn't want the super-duper \"easy\" controller. Most of these things are a pain. So why waste the money?The LG 570 is very well designed and the menus are easy to navigate. Most are for fine tuning if that is your bag. Me, I plugged it in ran the basic setup time zone, picture, and etc. It works great. I plug in the Roku and wow,, beautiful picture. The remote is well laid out and logical. I dislike those \"control\" everything remotes as they are a major pain to set up and only halfway work.Just a suggestion on unpacking. When messing with LCDs never touch the screen. I turned the box upside down edgewise. carefully cut the tape. Open the flaps tape them open if necessary. Turn the box top side up edgewise. Then simply left the box off while holding the TV. Now carefully study the stand installation in the included manual. There is an extra part (dust cover) which is installed when wall mounting the TV. It covers up the hole the table stand is installed in.The screws are in the bag the manual was in. I wouldn't use a power screw driver. Gently tighten each screw when all the other screws are installed. I propped the TV up by the backside. In my opinion it is not a good idea to lay it screen down even if the surface looks flat. The two table stand parts fit perfectly together. Attach four screws and snug them down. If you have to force the parts you have them wrong. Then drop the stand into the mount hole on TV. Of course the wide part of stand is to the front of TV. Install and snug four screws.I downloaded the full manual (about 70 pages)from the LG tech support website. Note; When searching the model number leave off LG letters. There is a ton of features available explained in the big manual. The included manual is just a bare bones getting started type..I got a handyman coming over take out the old TV (too heavy for me and my bad knee). Then I can hook up surround sound (fiber optic connection). There is no analog sound output. There is an input button on the top of the remote that brings up the input screen. Only those inputs that are active are selected. Also, you can create labels for the inputsI tried out a USB dongle with a ton of pictures. The folder navigator works good. There is a Vista type picture player that pops up when you select a picture and then you can do a slide show. Works very smooth.Ye Gods, 42 inches is HUGE. My first TV (cost about $1000 in today's money) was a 19 inch Admiral (that was a big one in 1950). Hey, 20 yrs before I had a \"cat whisker\" crystal radio. Grandpa said I was crazy to spend that kind of money on a silly box that was just a \"fad\". He sure enjoyed the old \"Oprey\" on the \"fad\".The local antenna input has an automatic scanner that picks out the \"good\"signal channels. It takes a bit of time in the Phoenix area. Just be patient. Geezz,I didn't realize how many digital channels there are. You may have to go back and delete some. The Quick menu is fast for deletes and adding. Note: when local antenna is hooked up no signal will be present until the scan is completed.I will do updates as time goes by. So far I LOVE IT!!!!Update (next day):  AUDIOWell, hooking up the surround sound (7 speakers )was a learning experience. Hooking up the fiber optic cable is a lot easier if you remember to remove the dust covers on each end of the cable (Amazon has them cheap). The sound is incredibly crystal clear. I knew there was loss in the analog cables, but I had no idea it was that much! Wow!! The Bose speakers came alive. I could blow out the windows at half power. My ears would probably go first. So I was careful with the sound level.A big problem with a audio optic output is that there is no volume control on the source. The sound level is controlled only by the speaker power amp. But the crystal clear sound is worth the inconvenience.When using my DirectTV box there was no optical output so I ran the cable (yellow, red white)into AV1 on the TV. I put the Ruko on HDMi 1. Every thing worked great.Now back to the sound level problem: The TV in house speakers are good (not great)but the sound volume control on remote works good. I have a 19 LCD tv and it had terrible speakers so I installed a Logitech computer sound system with bass unit(Amazon) plugged into the headphone jack on TV. Problem solved.As the LG has a headphone jack, I may do the same.Tune the Direct TV to ch 802 power up the surround sound the 1950's Doo Wop rocks (best music ever written of course Glenn Miller and Neil Diamond are close). The bass box rattles the windows. I mute the sound on the TV kick back and let the Malt shop memories flood back (News Flash: To all male younguns out there: Girls are predators and always have been)!Now I am going to dump my old DVD player and get one with optical output.Update:The Direct TV programming code for DTV remote is 10178.The DTV remote programming is in the system menu. You hold down the mute and select buttons until the TV light (move selector to TV) on Remote blinks 3 times. Then enter code. The sound button on DTV remote should popup the volume level indicator on TV screen. If so move the selector back to DTV and you are in business.New Update:  The in house speakers are so, so. I took the logictech computer speaker system and plugged them into the TV phone jack. Much better sound. The bass unit is really good.PROBLEM: When you plug into head phone jack the fiber optic  sound output cuts off. RATS, why did they do that? I wanted leave the computer speakers in and still be able to use the surround sound system for Netflix. So I am stuck with the cheapy in house speakers. The audio features are not well thought out...If you don't need the fiber optic audio out. Then get Logitech speakers with bass unit. They sound MUCH better than the in house speakers...", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "beautiful", "Author": "Terri Junk", "ReviewID": "R3GGHST0H255F6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "just received my new tv - once you turn off the energy saver it has a beautiful picture.  energy saver made the picture go very dark.  easy to put together and the owners manual CD is very detailed and made set up easy.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV ... with only one possible issue.", "Author": "Miggy \"Miggy, the Thief\"", "ReviewID": "R1GPR6M1G6GM8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm stilling giving the TV 5 stars, because the TV itself is fantastic. The picture is beautiful after calibration, and with energy saver mode turned off, obviously. I found that the TruMotion feature works under certain conditions, mostly for TV broadcasts. For DVD and Bluray, I had to turn it off - because, even though it did seem to make the image appear sharper (especially for DVD material), I just couldn't get used to the SOE. Suddenly, the Mentalist characters looked like they wandered onto the set of Days of Our Lives. Just too distracting.Anyway, my only possibly issue involves the stand. I don't know if this is normal or if I got a stand that's somehow defective. To put it simply, the TV wobbles. It's okay as it sits there and doesn't lean in any direction. But if I have to touch it to clean it or plug in a USB drive, I have to grab hold of a corner to keep it still. I took the stand apart and put it together again to make sure I tightened the screws adequately (I had originally worried about that, due to the fact the instructions said not to tighten them too much). After tightening it as much as I could by hand, the wobble still remained. The only thing I noticed unusual was when screwing the base into the TV itself. The bottom right screw had to be screwed in all the way from the outside of the cabinet, but the left bottom screw \"fell\" into the hole without having to be tightened first. I could still screw it in tight from where it \"landed\", but could it be missing some of its hold because of this? Just sitting on the stand, which it is 99% of the time, the TV is fine. I just wonder if it needs a replacement stand.Otherwise, I love the TV and it was a perfect fit for me, as I was not interested in having a \"smart TV\" and the 3D ones I've tried out at Best Buy give me a headache.UPDATE: I contacted LG support for the stand issue and they said it sounded like a defective stand. They sent out a new one. Their support was outstanding, responsive, and I received the part within days. Unfortunately, the bottom left screw still fell into the hole and the TV is still wobbly. It must be a problem with the screw hole on the TV. So I am going to live with the wobble rather than go to the trouble of returning the TV, as well as risking (with my luck) getting a replacement TV that has some issue with the display itself.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "The size and the price were right for me", "Author": "Music Lover", "ReviewID": "RUG6Q6ZCWL9L4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV after my 34\" Sony HDTV's (tube) power supply went out. I was ready to get rid of it anyway since it was a 200lb. monster but it had such a good picture that I hated to part with it.I had been watching TV prices for the past 6 months or more on Amazon and elsewhere. I had read numerous reviews of various models and wanted to purchase a TV that would fit in the 40\" space I have that would not cost an arm and a leg. I thought about all the various options including Internet access which I would love to have, the quality of picture on LCD, LED and Plasma's and thought about 3D a little bit. I decided what I really wanted was a great picture at a reasonable price and this model won out. It seems like Internet connectivity is almost refined now but I can live without it. I can definately live without 3D TV for now.I didn't go to a big box store to look at any models but I was comfortable I knew what I was doing after reading everything I could find online the last 6 months. I knew the style that I wanted and this LG is pretty handsome for a 42\" HDTV.I really wanted the Panasonic Plasma GT50 and still do but it is very expensive. After reading all the reviews I fell in love with it but I had to be practical and scale back my desires due to the cost. Since this LG was less than half the price of the GT50 and it fit into my space so I bought this model.I wanted 1080P and had to decide between LCD and LED. I also considered the LG 50\" Plasma model PA6500 which is only about a $100 more than this model. It has gotten really good reviews and is approximately half the price of the GT50.I am very picky and waned the best bang for my lesser buck. I searched the various brands and stores and decided on this model, had it delivered and the big Sony taken away. The 570 looks good where it sits. Its simple design is sharp looking and functional and is fairly easy to set-up. You can manually swivel the screen which is nice if you are the only person watching TV you can move it towards you.I was thinking Samsung LED or and LG LED also but since the LED's are more expensive I went LCD. This is my first LCD and it is going to take some getting used to. I enjoyed the picture on my tube but it was too small. The 42\" is big and just about the right size for my living room. We sit about 5-6 feet away from the TV.The settings on this TV are fairly easy to navigate thru. I took the energy saving feature off and then played with the picture settings for quite a few days until I was comfortable with what I was looking at. I tried the various modes which you can tweak to your personal taste. I settled on the Cinema picture mode and manually adjusted the settings to my taste. I have also thought about calibrating the picture which I pretty much did myself but would love to find the perfect settings in an online forum. If anyone sees this info anywhere please let everyone know.The sound quality is good. Separate Bass and Treble settings and a Clearvoice feature sound pretty good. There are 3 or 4 audio settings to choose from.I like the TV for the price and hope to learn to love it more as time goes on.

It was so very easy. It's been about a month now and it remains a joy to use. I later bought a LG Blu-ray disc player and once again it was easily mated to the TV and running with a few simple steps. Finally,truly user-friendly machines. The remotes for the tv & disc player can be used almost interchangeably, so there's only one remote needed most of the time. I don't have a single complaint.

Yeah, I would have saved sales tax buying it on Amazon but being able to have the TV tested in the store then being able to control it's shipping to my house 8 miles away was worth the little extra expense to me.I replaced my little 28\" Hannspree LCD LCD so going from 28\" to 47\" was a big, beautiful jump in screen size. The LG 47CS570 had the 1080P and the 120Hz refresh rate I was looking for. The only thing I also wanted was LED back lighting but for this size TV, having that back lighting over the older Fluorescent back-lighting was too much extra expense for the money. The 47CS570 has a great picture only jumping from the little Hannspee to the large LG really shows how much worse 480p is from 1080i or 1080p. On the smaller set, the lower resolution did not really show, on the bigger set, it shows up in a big way and I have trouble tolerating standard definition now on the larger set. Thankfully, my cable company has an HD station alternative for all the old SD stations I used to watch. I've had good luck with LG products so let this void out some of the others who trash LG.

At 60 HTZ I noticed that the game play would not be smooth and vary \"lagy\" .  I would recommend this product to anyone, truly unbeatable price as well.  Also within the first three months of owning it, the screen started to turn of and on randomly without doing anything to it, and it got to the point were it would not stay on at all.  I called up LG told them of my problem they were extremely helpful,  the TV being under warranty they sent a technician out without question.

I bought a 32\" LG about 2 years ago and loved it. However, I went abroad soon after for about a year so I left it to my parents. When I got back they were not willing to give it up. I started doing some research and purchased this TV about a month ago. I decided to upgrade to a 42\" but stick with the LG brand since I liked my 32\" so much. My first reaction was this thing is HUGE but after staring at a 20\" TV for almost 6 months that is probably a normal response.Picture:Picture quality is great on this TV, the colors are excellent and I really like the no blur motion. At first it through me off, after so many years of watching TV and having moving objects blur across the screen. I like to watch a lot of action movies so this was definitely a cool feature that made everything seem more real. Also great for video gaming since there is a lot of motion with the characters while playing.Menus and settings:Menus and setting adjusting is easy to use. There is a very detailed picture adjustment function that lets you set all the colors to your liking. It is fairly easy to switch back and forth between component, HDMI and cable which is not always the case with TVs.Connecting ports:One of the biggest things for me is that there is a PC connection since I like to connect my computer to the TV. While looking for TV I noticed that many of the lower end models no longer have this feature. I was annoyed when my DVI to VGA cable would not work with this TV. Although I was able to find a HDMI to DVI on amazon for cheap it was an added aggravation and expense.Price:Budget was an issue for me but I was not willing to sacrifice quality. That is where I think this TV is great. Trying to find a reliable brand with solid 1080P picture quality, 120 HZ for a good price is not easy.Overall:I am reluctant to give this TV 5 stars due to the hassle with the HDMI cable however this TV delivers on all fronts (plus the cool no blur.)

It is just the right size for an apartment living room.The stand is very well engineered.Fit together well.If you have an LG Blu-Ray player, there is a simplink button that will turn it on and automatically switch to that source and you can also control the bluray player from the TV remote. Happy accident :)Edit: Forgot this pro: very thoughtful of LG. The menu has settings on what to do with the power/standby LED. I have disabled the LED for power, and enabled it for standby. I know when the TV is on, duh! Since I turn off the power strip to save power, I want to know when the TV is on standby vs. when the power strip is on. Very thoughtful to include this setting. I returned a P50UT50 for a different reason, but it had an LED that would be on when the TV is on. Is that dumb or what?ConsSource switching is a bit painful. But I think I will figure out a way in time. I've only had the TV a day.Simplink does not bring you back to what you were watching when you get out. It also does not turn off the blu ray player.Overall, I am very happy though. Especially with the matte screen and sound.--------------------------------Update 5/29/13:I am still kind of shocked at the value I got this TV for. We made a trip to Michigan over the weekend, came home, plugged a USB flash drive, and ran a photo slideshow. The interface is  nothing fancy but the colors were ridiculous. The other day I found myself watching Castle on TNT (worst written show ever!) just because of how good the picture looked. I've been watching Cardinals BB games for the last two months and it's perfect for those as well. I haven't messed with the settings much. I recently switched to AT&T; U-verse and am pleased to report that like my Dish remote before, the uverse remote can fully control the TV including input switching. I did the auto search and skipped the first match and ran to the second match. The first match would work for volume and power, but only the second match was able to switch inputs. With a new version out, I would expect this to be snaggable for $350-$400 in the near future.

WOW!", "Author": "Louis Leikach \"LLinMD\"", "ReviewID": "R1VQPMOACC2RNO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say, my path to the 42CS570 was not straightfowrad.  BTW, I didn't buy this item on Amazon, but that was just because I have a Best Buy less than 2 miles from my house.  I buy a lot of items from Amazon, the biggest, a Broil King grill, but for the TV, the BB was just convenient. Anyway, back to the review.  I bought 2 TVs at the same time, a 55\" for the family room (the LG 55LM7600 - which at the time of this writing, I still have not had delivered - by choice), and then I was trying to figure out which set to purchase for the bedroom. I didn't do as much research as I did on the 55\", and I sort of paid the price.  I bought a 37\" Samsung LED (UN37EH5000) on sale for about $450 - within my price range.  I was still trying to figure out if I liked the set when BB offered the UN39EH5000 for the same price.  I exchanged it. That's when I really started getting into the TV. And I found it lacking. I wasn't happy with how the color washed out and seemed pasty when I wasn't directly in front of it.  A not too sharp angle just left me cold - and my wife too.  I started more indepth research and I think the LED I had is an edge-lit TV.  From what I can tell, the backlit sets are brighter and have less tendency to have the bad angle effect.  I considered exchanging for a plasma - again down to a 43\" Samsung and and a 42\" LG.  But once I got into the store and saw both sets - I was really put off by the color (whites were pink or grey) and the glassy reflective screens.  I know you have to get past the setups in the stores.  The lighting is all wrong, the room size is unrealistic, yada-yada-yada. But I just couldn't get past what my eyes were seeing.  And after all, when all the specs are read, despite what they say, it's what your eyes discern that makes the TV work for you or not.Back to the drawing board. I believe what I was looking for was a backlit LED with local dimming - but it was just a little out of my price range.  What to do... what to do? I went with a little older technology - an LCD. From all I read, they are reliable and have very decent specs. In the store, it passed my eyeball test.  I just had to wrap my head around not going with the \"latest\" technology.  I did want 1080p and I did want the 120Hz.  The LG 42CS570 was the set that fit my scaled back goals. All I can say is WOW!. First, it was easier to set up than the Samsung - which itself wasn't too difficult to set up. The Picture Wizard - what can I say.  Easy as pie to set the best settings for my eyes.  And it was the 3rd TV set in a less than 10 day period that I had done it with.  And the picture... and the sound!  I did pay another $50 to upgrade to the 42CS450 - yes... I definitely feel it was an upgrade.  Picture is incredibly clear and the sound has no need for a soundbar or surround sound. Perfect for our bedroom.

To my delight, Saturday morning the Fedex delivery guy was knocking at my door, just in time for playoff football. Not bad considering shipping and handeling was only \u00a2.99! Setup was a piece of cake. The picture was so nice, I wanted to re-watch some of my favorite shows. So I launched the HBOGO app on my xbox and watched a few episodes of Game of Thrones. It looked amazing, it was like I was watching it again for the first time. I watched some college basketball (Go Hoyas!) and you could see beads of sweat drip off the players face while he was at the free throw line. The picture is almost too good. My old 52' 720p Toshiba seems like garbage now. 3 HDMI ports are key; no more going behind the TV just to watch a blu-ray or play xbox. I tried the usb port, I'm not sure if I was doing anything wrong but when I plugged in my iphone5 it's not talking to the TV but it does charge. For all the people that have issues with the sound. What are you expecting? It's a flat screen TV, the speakers are in the back. If you don't want to invest in a sound bar, you can always buy the simple red/white audio wire and connect it to a home stereo system. it will sound 10x better. Bottom line. buy this tv especially if you have an xbox or PS3 (because it's not a 'smart TV') and invest in sound if you're buying a flat screen.

Its worth insisting on this or you will have to fight distracting reflections.Picture quality generally: This unit puts out one of the most\"accurate\" looking pictures I have seen. Some other tv's  would have some colors that were impressive- basically because they were almost fluorescent- not impressively realistic.Sound:Pretty good. Not Bose surround sound (or whatever).Internet connectivity: It has none -and you probably should not care in the long run. I've been in computers a long time. Checked in with various sources. Turns out that you can get these roku, apple and other set top box's cheap- 65-95 maybe. These are powerful very cheap devices that allow some people to completely turn off their cable or satellite and get all their tv content thru roku using the internet. These are add ons  for any tv. Bottom Line for the long run: Forget about whatever connectivity deal that comes with any tv. Before too long you will own one of these inexpensive- and the main point- continually evolving internet set top boxes. No way that whatever came out in a tv in 2012 will have anything like the capabilities of a set top box (they don't today) and imagine what those boxes will be able to do in a few more years.Overall: Like it a lot so far, really glad I insisted on the matte screen.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV!

No clouding or banding ..colors that were vibrant and beautiful ...I could actually see a great picture even on the sunniest days...I connected a toshiba sound bar and a Sony Blueray player  with built in wifi so it became a smart tv...if you are someone who wants to tweak your set to perfection there are tons of settings to do this..I simply love this set so much that I chose the 47 inch for my living room...guess what...same glorious picture...it connected right up to my surround receiver giving me the theater experience I wanted.

Physical appearance: Great. Picture: Not so great. Here is the issue. I am not exactly sure what terms they use for this but based on what I've read it's called motion blur and it sucks. It seems like what is happenening is when a person moves accross the screen the picture (or the \"information\" as far as the processor is concerned) is not rebuilding fast enough to look normal. In other words, I see an outine around the figure that looks like a mess of blocky, blurry pixels. Its especially noticable when a dark figure moves accross a light background. The tv is advertised as one with a high number of hertz which would eliminate the blur but I find this to be untrue and false advertising. It seems less problematic with the newer films but with the older ones, especially on dvd, it is very distracting. Besides this the picture is great. When things are moving slow or the figures on the screen are still, it looks great.
