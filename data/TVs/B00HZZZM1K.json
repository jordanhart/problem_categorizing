I haven't used the web browser or downloaded movies. I played a bluray and it was great, the depth of the picture and clarity are excellent. I talked with sharp and they told me that soon they will be having a service where you can call them and they can remotely tweak the tv which i am looking forward to. I'm looking forward to 4k in the future. If you decide to get this tv I would definately recommend upgrading your HDMI cables to 2.0 as opposed to 1.4 This tv comes with the 2.0 HDMI built in which is the standard for 4k  If you have a 2013 TV or older check with your manufacturer about possibly upgrading the HDMI inputs to 2.0 , rumor has it that sony will be sending out installers to upgrade customers for free.  I also haven't tried the 3D , I didnt receive any glasses in the box and from what ive heard my older active glasses will not work with this set. Overall this TV seems great for the money, can't wait for my friends to check it outI wanted to add that I used the 3d it works great. the glasses need to be bought separately . Also the 4k ready if used will be 2k not true 4k. The upscaling revelation technology seems to be awesome and is what makes the picture look great I am assuming. If you are looking for a great picture for bluray and HD this set delivers, if you want one with true 4k for the future your gonna need to shell out an extra 2 grand.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Got this to solve my Vizio problems.", "Author": "David L. Laidig", "ReviewID": "RN491LCG6JFP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is just amazing. I purchased two Vizio 70''s and got two duds. I upgraded to this bad boy and never looked back. There are some reviews that state that this TV is complicated, or hard to set up. This TV is totally programmable when it comes to user preferences. This thing is like a new computer. RIGHT CLICK ON EVERYTHING!!!! The color out of the box is heart stopping. The whites are pure, and when it fades to black, with the power light disabled, you cannot tell that it is powered up. The motion as one other reviewer put it, is as smooth as butter. The upconvert is fantastic. Yes upconvert is programmable! The web menu is nice and customizable! The speakers are there. I am not using them. The remote is not backlit. I used it to program my RF10, and took the batteries out of it and put it away. the stand is massive and appears very safe. I am not using that either, rather I hung it on the wall. There is a 25% washout degradation at 30 degrees off center. However, it is no big deal unless you wish to watch it from another room on an angle. The Sharp is very attractive and not too heavy. I am very happy with it so far.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Pic quality viewed front-on", "Author": "Ambuyer07345", "ReviewID": "R25J5HXI0H15F3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update 04/01/2014:Final resolution from Sharp: the wifi module is bad (2nd in a row) and they will not fix the module but replace the TV \"in the coming 2 weeks\". Since this is the 2nd TV and I don't have a firm ETA on a replacement, I am sending the TV back to amazon for a refund. Amazon has been great to increase the return window a tad bit so that the debug with Sharp could conclude. In contrast, Sharp service has been OK at best. Also, I have since looked at a lot more TVs in this 3 week period and a Sharp LCD panel is not something I would not buy in my current setup due to picture washout issues while viewing at a 45 degree angle.If viewing angle and wifi were not an issue, it would be 5 stars. With these issues, I rate it 3 stars. Your mileage may vary.Update 03/14/2014:The Wifi connection issue alluded to earlier has not been fixed despite Amazon providing a replacement TV. Both units fail to connect to my simple wifi setup, regardless of trying various connection methods (WPS, PIN, Manual etc.) and trying out various security (None, WPA, WPA2 etc.). Our ISP is CenturyLink and the LG 60\" Smart TV connects quickly/easily via wireless to the internet....just like the tons of other tablets/phones/PCs/Macs at home. Sharp took 2 weeks before sending a tech from a local service shop. The tech was unable to locate the issue (the TV would not connect to his Samsung phone hotspot while other devices could). Awaiting resolution from Sharp. At this point the wireless module (and specifically, the Transmit path) is a suspect. The wired connection OK and the firmware upgrade has been easy otherwise.If the issue is not resolved a week prior to Amazon's hassle-free return date, the TV must unfortunately be sent packing. While Sharp's support has been so-so (and is just beginning to wake up to this issue which may affect several clients), Amazon has been fantastic so far. In the future, I would rather buy a TV at amazon than deal with the pressure sales at a local store.Review from 02/28/2014:Received today AM, and already, it has impressed me beyond expectations when viewing front-on. This is replacing a new 240Hz 3D LG 60\" TV (which itself has an excellent 1080p picture) and the 70\" Sharp screen beats it hands-down in its depth of colors, clean edges and crisp motion while rendering regular HD 1080p content being delivered by a DishNetwork HD receiver.We also have a 4K PC source (Intel Haswell NUC) and after switching to the 4K resolution proceeded to evaluate quality of some youtube 4K videos. Most of the \"4K\" content turned out to be 2K but the picture quality seemed improved further as evidenced by excellent color separation in the little details being rendered. Haven't upgraded to an HDMI 2.0 cable yet, but I'd expect that to only improve things further, if at all.Cosmetically, this is a sleek unit and complements our contemporary home perfectly.The amazon delivery service contractor (Ceva Logistics) did an awesome job of helping setup this huge monster.The TV sound from it's native speakers ....is puny in contrast. The bass is weak. The sound is surprisingly weaker than 60\" TV in a smaller/sleeker cabinet. At times the volume has to be turned up 85/100 to hear the midrange clearly. The audio path would be rated as 1 star out of 5, if evaluated separately.The panel has a great picture in the sweet spot of it's viewing area. But when viewed from the side, the picture is brighter. Several non-plasma panels suffer in this area, and so at this price point I choose not to ding it and keep the 5 stars.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Incredible TV!", "Author": "mwisker", "ReviewID": "R1J9RIACO3Z49C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I purchased this TV because we needed a larger TV for our living room. I have to say that everything about it is amazing! Picture clarity is phenomenal! The on screen menus are a little confusing as is the integrated owner's manual. I would recommend downloading a PDF of the manual for ease of use. We are certainly not disappointed! There is some information online stating that any active shutter 3D glasses will work with this TV. This is not true. You must buy the Sharp active 3D glasses. Other than these very small things we are completely satisfied with this purchase!!", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great picture, after firmware update much faster. Does not come with 3D glasses", "Author": "J. Haggard", "ReviewID": "RH1NU7MVZBJVF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the opportunity to use both this tv and the similar LC-60UQ17U. These TV's are identical except the LC-60UQ17U features an aluminum bezel and a heavier duty stand. That being said, I prefer this TV over the upgraded version. Here's why.My purpose of a large flat screen TV is to mount it on my wall. I think the LC-60UQ17U (upgraded model) looks really nice, but the bezel is so thin anyways it's hard to really notice it. And in a wall mount application you'll never even use the heavy duty stand.This TV is lighter and easier to move. I could comfortably life this tv by myself and carry it from the floor in my living room to the hutch where it ultimately will live.The connections on this model are identical to the upgraded model, essentially it's the exact same tv minus aluminum trim and it's a few hundred dollars cheaper.So that's the comparison.So how does this TV perform?The TV is really nice. It features an easy to access power cord on the back, and the HDMI, optical, etc are all either side or down facing so you can mount this on the wall without having cables pushing the TV out from the wall. The ports are all easy to access when mounted, but far enough behind that you don't see cables or devices sticking out from behind the TV.In my use I have a TiVO, blu ray 3D player and a chromecast connected and have 1 HDMI and a few USB ports to spare.The TV features one setting I have not seen on other TV's, that is a \"wallpaper mode\". I thought it was pretty cool and played around with it for a while. My wife came in the room a few hours later and said \"what's that?\" I explained and she was not impressed to say the least. She would rather the TV be off fully than on wasting energy even if it's reduced amount.I will say the wallpaper mode does have a few settings you can tweak. One is to select if you want a clock or pictures, the clock is nature themed with leaves making up elements of the clock. It's nice, but I think it makes the TV look a little tacky. The other option is picture mode where you can use pre-loaded works of art which is my preference. It really makes the TV pop, and if you had it wall mounted with a nice border around it you could make it look like a framed piece of art when off. It's actually pretty slick.There is also a setting to use your own pictures that you load on a USB drive, I couldn't get that to work. I put pictures on a drive stuck it in the USB port and the TV instantly pulled the pictures up to view them. But when in the wallpaper mode it never would show my pictures, it always went back to the pre-loaded works of art.This TV does feature 3D and it works great, very easy to turn on with the included remote. What I don't like is this tv does NOT include any 3D glasses, if you want them thats an extra charge. That is where the upgraded model (LC-60UQ17U) beats this one as that one includes a pair (2) of 3D glasses.Power saving modes and the such. So I had this TV set using the defaults and the picture was OK, but it really tries to save power using some light sensors and stuff to alter the brightness automatically. While this is appreciate it kills the quality of the picture, even the wife complained about it so I turned off the eco modes and tweaked until we were both happy with the picture. I do think it's funny this TV features all these advanced power saving modes, then when you turn it off the wallpaper is on which means the display is still on.... Not really a true power saving TV. Yes wallpaper mode is optional, but just an observation.I will add, when I first connected this TV the menus were so slow to load and move around. I was finally able to get the TV on my network using the WPS setup which was great since the remote interface was so sluggish and entering my wifi password was nearly impossible. But once it it was online I hit the firmware update button, it found one downloaded and installed it in about 10 minutes and after the TV came back up it was flying. Looks like they fixed the menu issue so do make sure if you get this TV to check for any software updates first thing.All in all it's a good Tv. The picture is crisp and clear, 3D looks great once you get a pair of glasses, sound is acceptable but I prefer an external sound system still. Wallpaper mode is a nice gimmick, online videos and applications work as expected.  For a 60\" TV this one is really good.Compare that to another 60\" I have, the Vizio 601i-A3 which is a 2013 model and does not offer 4K or 3D but is between $400-$600 cheaper depending on if you buy it online or at a big box store I would honestly prefer the Vizio if you don't need 4K or 3D. The displays are both really good, yes 4K is better, if you have 4K content but there is not much of that out today. If you are looking specifically for a 4K 3D tv, this is good. I have also used the  Samsung ultra-4k UN55HU8550  which runs about $1000 more than this TV and I can't even come close to recommending that one from a cost/feature standpoint.All in all this TV is right in the sweet spot. It has some nice features, it works very well, has a great display you can tweak. It's lacking 3D glasses so it loses one star for that. But everything else about it makes this a really good TV at a reasonable price. If you are using the stand it's a little bit of a let down in it's appearance but not bad. This TV really shines if you plan on hanging it on the wall.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!", "Author": "Chris Brown", "ReviewID": "RS9YKCE5XADSK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the quality of picture with this tv.. also very good on the price compared to the competition.. cant wait for football season!!", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "This TV is AWESOME!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Charles C.", "ReviewID": "R1KIOVTWYQ7QMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, I waited until I had the TV for a couple of months and had everything set the way I wanted it before I wrote this review. This way I can say what is and isn't good about it without it being just first impression. So here are the PROS and CONS:PRO1. This thing is huge!2. The picture is super clear3. The Smart functions and apps work great4. Wireless internet setup was easy5. It streams movies from my computer through the wireless network.6. The 3D is great7. Fiber optic cable out for stereo sound bar8. Did I mention that this thing is HUGE!9. It is pretty light weight for as big as it is {about 70lbs} so it was easy to hang on the wallCONS1. The speakers are awful. It sounds like you're listening to it over a speaker phone. You will need to get a sound bar for it2. Setting the color is going to be painful if you do it yourself. I recommend having the color professionally calibrated  It has 2 more things that I don't like, but they are so minor I can't list them with the CONS. They are that the internet browser doesn't  handle JAVA or Shockwave type games well {this is minor as I don't surf the net on the TV much} and the CODECs for the video player needs to be updated {it doesn't play some of my MPEG or AVI files off my computer}.  So it looks like the good out weighs the bad by a long shot on this and that makes this one awesome television.

I'm not a geek, so I won't be telling you aspect ratio numbers and internet speeds and crap. The TV is big. The frame is small, thin. This means big picture. There is talk of \"soap opera\" effect. If that means sharp, crisp, clear, smooth picture, then I'm for it. There are several settings; movie, dynamic... There is a light sensor setting you can turn on or off. My TV is between two windows. With the setting on, it adjusts to the light. Leaves pop up on the screen, you can turn them off, as the backlight adjusts. I have no glare. I have Directv. Watching TV is awesome. Fabulous picture. Hook up with an HDMI cable is simple. The sound from the TV is not real good. If you have a 70 inch TV and don't have surround sound, well... That was an easy hook up as well. Internet: easy set up to your home network. I've watched Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and used the browser. The only problem I've had was with the Hulu app. Don't know if it's the app, internet or what. I watched some 4K videos on YouTube. Awesome! I was impressed. I found the web browser a little difficult until I hooked up a mouse. I have a Sharp bluray player. When I switch to that input, the player comes on. I found that cool. 3D blurays are great. Of course some are better than others. That's not the TV's fault. I did have to buy glasses. The 2D to 3D conversion is ok. It's fun to play with.You can spend an entire day with all the settings. You can tweek it however you like. The best thing is that the manual is available to pull up right on the TV.I have no dead pixels. No blur spots. No glare. Love this TV. I can't wait for football season.4 stars because the sound is poor, the 3D up conversion is just ok, there is only one kind of glasses, they are active (battery), they are not cheap, and the Hulu app seems to be sluggish.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!", "Author": "E.

I connected it through an Ethernet cable. Movies play as well as they do from a disk.I also connected an Apple TV. The Apple TV streams stuff from my Mac Book Pro over Wi-Fi. It's also streaming fast enough to play in real-time with no pauses or issues with the movie.The cool thing is that I can select the audio control on the Sharp remote and control the apple TV as a learned remote.The Sharp also automatically controls the Sony Home Theater system even without programming.I have everything working with a single remote and I didn't have to actually program anything or find any codes.The most surprising thing is how good the sound quality is directly from the TV.It's almost as good as the home theater system.Some jealous neighbors where saying, \"Well you can't even get 4K content,\" but I have noticed that it makes things recorded in SD look like HD and it makes HD look way better. I can literally count eyelashes on people on the screen even on a Netflix streaming HD movie.Blue-ray movies look incredible! That's all I need to say about that.I also like the wallpaper feature.I put a USB drive into the TV with a folder called WP. It can play the wallpaper photos even when it's off then it turns itself all the way off after 3 hours. This is very good as a store display as well.

The picture is pretty good out of the box and only a calibration disc setup is needed to get great looking picture. When I got my first set, I noticed some flashlighting in the top-left corner, four clouding spots in the middle left of the screen and some LED bleeding along the bottom of the TV. After watching TV for a couple of days and tweaking the TV settings, the spots seemed to calm down, but never disappeared. It was faint, but still bugged me.I decided to take the TV back and exchange it for another one, only to have the same flashlighting and clouding in the SAME EXACT AREAS. Only it is even worse on the second one I received.Now I am going to have to return the second one as it is too distracting to enjoy watching TV. The defects do not show up when watching TV in a bright room, but most of my TV is watched in a dim room at night.I spent a few hours on the phone with Sharp about 3D not showing up on Netflix and it was nothing but a hassle with them pointing fingers at Netflix. I also had Netflix on IM and they told me that the TV checks into their network when you access the app. So it is the TV not telling the server that it is a 3D tv. I currently meet all the requirements to at home to stream 3D content on Netflix and I was able to do it on a Vizio without issue. I also contacted them about not controlling DirectTV in the Smart Center and opened a case. (this might be an issue with direct TV not allowing CEC control) I now have two cases opened with Sharp and I have not received a response back on either one, completely useless support.I also found that turning on their video processing features will cause an audio delay (lip sync) that can't be corrected very easily. I tend to turn most of that garbage off outside of the refresh rate and video upscaling, but be warned.The picture on this TV is quite good, but only when viewing it directly on. If I sit just outside the right edge of the TV, the color and pictures fade quickly. I watched some 4K videos on YouTube and they were quite enjoyable to watch. Standard TV looked pretty good as well.3D content looked OK, but was very blurry with motion on screen and was hard to follow. There is also a lot of cross talk, but this might be an issue with active TV. It would have been nice if they included glasses in the box for the price of the TV. Most other companies do now.I wish they would have also included SKYPE, as that was one of my favorite features on my last TV so I could talk to my out of town family.Overall, I think this set has some good and bad that could be fixed, but I wouldn't count on Sharp to fix it. I really want to keep this TV, but I am going to have to return it as the negatives are too great for me.UPDATE: 4-9-2014To my surprise, I was contacted by the Supervisor/Product Specialist from Sharp based on the review I left above. We spoke about the various issues that I have been having with the TV and I sent him a few pictures to demonstrate the clouding and flashlighting I have on the TV. He said that he is escalating them to the appropriate people to investigate. He said that he would contact me as soon with a solution for the various issues that I have had. I am glad that he contacted me as I was preparing to return the TV tomorrow. I will update my review when I hear back from Sharp...Update 5/2/2014So the people at Sharp offered to test out another TV and inspect it \"in house\" for any clouding or uniformity issues and deliver it to my door. I am happy to say that they stepped up there level of support by offering this to me. They also explained that the other issues I was having are currently being worked on with updates to come in the next few months (firmware updates). I was sad to tell them that I returned the TV, but it was not due to their effort, rather it was because I was able to repair my other TV for about $200.I have a Panasonic TC-P55GT30 plasma that is just over 2 years old and had the 7-blinking lights of death. I was able to find a person on eBay that can repair the board for $100. (I also spend $91 on having a TV repair person diagnose my issue. This was a waist as he did not tell me anything I did not know) Since I spent about $1800 on this TV, I would expect to get more than 2 years out of the think, sheesh!I did not see the need to keep the Sharp and pay over $2000 (with tax and warranty) when my other TV was now fixed. I did thank them for their effort and let them know that when I do need to pick up another TV in the future, that their efforts will be an influence in my decision.Overall, I think that this is a very good TV, that just needs a little more refinement and a little better QC on the assembly line.

The reason for our choice were:- the screen size- the picture quality (we looked at it in a store and found it to be sharp and the colors to be vibrant; quite honestly, we did not see much of a difference in the picture quality of this TV and others of the same size)- the 2 composite, 1 component inputs which allow us to connect our old VCR, DVD and HIFI amplifier (many new TVs have too few)- the 4K upwards compatibility which sould allow us to still use this TV in 10 years when 4K may be the new standard and replace HDTV.- the great reviewsThe TV stand is connected to the TV in a few minutes and the basic TV setup is easy and also done in a few minutes.  We liked the preset color settings and did not change them.At first, we listened to the sound over the built-in speakers and thought that it was not too bad.  Then we turned on our surround sound system and realized how BAD the built-in speakers really are.  I guess, if someone does not have a comparison, then the built-in speakers may suffice, but once you connect external speakers to the TV, then you will NEVER EVER want to go back.  We set the speaker volume to 0 and only use our surround sound system.Some people mentioned that the sound and picture are not synchronized.  We found:- the picture and the sound from the built-in speakers are always synchronized- the picture and the sound from our surropund sound system were not synchronized in the beginning.  This problem was EASILY fixed by adjusting the time lag at our amplifier.  Our amplifier has an input for the distance between the individual speakers and the place where you sit.  The distance determines the time lag between the sound and the displayed picture.Other things that we love:- the ability to connect a computer to the TV via VGA cable- the youtube app that allows us to watch youtube videos without the need to connect a computer- the USB connectivity which allows us to play videos or a photo slideshow.  The slideshow settings are, however, too limited.  This is something Sharp should improve.- the price!!!Other things that could be improved:- it takes significantly longer to start up than our old Sony- it takes longer to switch channels than with our old TV (same set top box, same STP settings)- I would like to see a second USB port- the slideshow settings are too limited; I would like to see the option to select individual folders, have an easier file selection and the slideshow to display the photos full screen- the sound of the built-in speakers- most other 3D TVs have 3D glasses included, this TV does not.  But it comes at a very attractive price, so I don't mindLong story short: We love this TV, are very happy with it and definitely recommend it!", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "4k at 1080p price", "Author": "james", "ReviewID": "R2EE1TTMOSCGP3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very picky and skeptical about purchasing a 4k tv. This is absolutely beautiful. The picture is crisp on every resolution. Its massive, so clear the proper space for it. Theres no difficulty for startup it runs butter smooth with a dual core processor. The menu system is fantastic with definition of each modification you select. When I saw 1080p with 4k i figured it was a gimmick. I watched hours of 4k content on youtube all with crystal clear picture. The sound is surprising excellent which generally blows on lcd tvs. SHARP should be proud of making an 4k television at 70\" and it still cost less that any 55\" 4k smart tv. Xbox one looks very very good with its included hdmi 1.4. It seems like the 1080p picture does in fact get upconverted. Performed a side by side with a 47\" vizio 1080p and there was a significant difference in clarity. Almost bought the seiki 50\" but thank the lord I saved up the extra $.

I have had both a 46\" Sharp LCD bought in 2006, and a 60\" Sharp LED bought in 2011.  Both of those sets worked flawlessly - never any kind of problem - and I sold them with my house prior to an interstate move.This is my first \"smart\" Sharp TV, and, of course, the first one with 3-D.  The major consumer magazine suggested that if a buyer wanted a smart TV, the 3-D feature was probably going to come along with it, whether you wanted it or not.  When I started shopping, I found that to be true.This new set tops its predecessors in every way.  The picture, which has always been great on the Sharps, is even better.  The depth and sharpness of color is absolutely eye-watering.  The only drawback to this set (and all other LED's) is the edge lighting which can produce a gray glow around the edges when watching a picture that is almost entirely black (i.e. shot at night).  But to get away from this issue, you are forced to go to a plasma set and all of its drawbacks (horrible screen glare, and the need for an almost theater-dark room to enjoy the color).  The Sharp LED has a matte screen so there is very little problem with glare.  Even in a pretty brightly lit room, the picture still shows strong colors and contrast.  I find that the picture quality and brightness remain strong even when viewed from an angle.  Two very important things if you buy this set: during set-up you will get an option asking you whether this is a \"home set-up\" or a \"store display\".  Make sure you select home set-up.  Then I would suggest going into the video picture settings menu option, and change from \"standard energy star\" to either \"dynamic\" or \"dynamic (fixed)\".  That is what causes the picture to come alive.  The energy saving setting (which is the default setting the set will be on when you fire it up) is too dull and lifeless to my taste.Sound quality?  Not so great.  But if you're buying a 60\" set you will probably hook it into a home theater surround sound system anyhow.Now, about the 3-D.  When I was ten years old I thought that 3-D was distracting and hard to watch.  Now almost 50 years later my opinion hasn't changed much.  I popped the extra money for the dedicated 3-D glasses that work only with the Sharp TV's and bought a new 3-D Bluray player along with a few movies in 3-D I thought I might find entertaining.  I might have saved myself the money.  I guess it's somewhat a matter of taste.  If you enjoy the 3-D experience in a movie theater, maybe you will like this feature more than I do.  Personally I find the 3-D effect so distracting that it interferes with following the movie.  The 3-D glasses are also a pain in the butt if you wear regular glasses.  Oh - and one more thing - if you do have a sophisticated surround sound system that's more than three years old, chances are that your a/v receiver does not have a 3-D pass-through feature, meaning that if you run the HMDI cable from your Bluray Player into the a/v receiver, and then another HDMI cable from the a/v receiver to the TV, the 3-D TV will NOT get a 3-D signal.  There are two solutions to this.  Buy a new a/v receiver with a 3-D pass-through feature (which most mid-range and higher units now have), or connect your 3-D Bluray player directly to your TV.  Of course, when you do that, the sound will go through the TV speakers, not your massive sound system.  There is a fix to that, too.  The Sharp TV has an optical digital sound output that you can run to your a/v receiver.  WIth a few changes to your a/v set-up you can get the 5.1 or 7.1 sound going through your a/v system, and the 3-D picture feeding directly to the TV.  One last thing about the 3-D feature: the Sharp TV allows you to adjust the intensity of the 3-D effects so you can tune them up or down to your preference.Finally we come to the Smart TV functions.  I can't believe I ever lived without them!  Netflix, Hulu Plus, Vudu, Pandora, You Tube and tons of others (but not Amazon for some bizarre reason) all right there on the TV.  The Sharp TV does have a wireless capability, but you would be much better off buying a dual-band router and running a hard Ethernet cable right into the TV.  If you do that you will have a stable connection and never any buffering.  The Smart functions also include a DLNA input which wirelessly connects to your home computer and allows you to listen to music, look at pictures, or even watch movies that you have downloaded into your computer - all in 60\" glory.  Is life great or what?  I presume that there will be a firmware/software update at some time to add Amazon to the list of apps.  In the meantime, my new Bluray player (Sony) has Amazon in its app list.I recommend this set without any hesitation.  Even shipping the set, which made me a bit nervous worked out fine.  Amazon contracts to a trucking company and the TV arrived in less than a week. The trucking company calls in advance to schedule the delivery and the driver was fine with bringing the TV right into my media room for me.  It was securely packed by Sharp, so nothing was damaged.  When you take the set out of the box you might find you need a second person to help you.
