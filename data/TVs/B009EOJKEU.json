Other review is false.", "Author": "Mohammed", "ReviewID": "RMIGFI8DLFAOM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would like to start my review by commenting on the other review. I viewed the TV at Costco and it is, in fact, NOT the same TV. It has the same specs, but is not in fact the same model number. The TV at Costco had a much more dull, inaccurate color to it as well. I think this is the difference between this tv and the UW40TC1W.On the TV itself: The TV's picture is really good for the money. I am using a Dish Satellite with a Joey Hopper and it looks great. I use it in my bedroom and lie about 8-10 feet away (head to screen). I hooked up my BR Drive and the picture was clear and crisp (not vivid or exciting like a Samsung, but still very good). (Make sure your input is set to 1080p--I was watching 480p until I realized there was a difference in my Dish Joey settings).Pros: Price, picture, size, LED, 120Hz, 1080p, calibration presetsCons: Basic remote, lackluster feature set (hard to adjust and calibrate picture, but see above), not smart TV, and no \"smooth motion setting\"Overall, the TV is priced right, but not a 5 start TV at all. Given the price, I can only knock one star. It is what it is and it's not trying to be anything it isn't. See cons.Update: Wanted to add that I have not attempted to mount this. The TV is breaking in some and looks better every week to me. I have used it with my HP DV7 to play Bluray and they look pretty darned good. I also hooked it up to my desktop via my GTX295 and enjoyed COD4 and BFBC2 with lots of immersion. I have always wanted to play on something this large. Paired with the GTX295 and an HDMI cable, games look great with little screen lag.Side note: I received the TV with absolutely 0 dead pixels or any other cosmetic issues. I might just be lucky, but in the some 12 devices I have owned with flat panels, only my PSP had a single dead pixel. I feel terribly sorry for those with as many as 5-6 with any given brand, but no issues at all here!", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tricky to mount, but here's the secret.", "Author": "Joshua Merrill", "ReviewID": "R11VY7A3YKJRFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV on 11/26/12 (that's Cyber Monday, if you're keeping track). It arrived a couple days later, and everything in the box was in good shape and worked perfectly.The Westinghouse UW40T2BW is a no-frills TV, so there's very little to set up. I connected my Apple TV to it and everything worked great. The picture and sound quality are surprisingly good for a budget TV, and the thin bezel puts the focus on what's *on* the screen instead of what's around it. The TV is slim and weighs less than 30 pounds, making it ideal to mount.About that. Amazon describes this TV as VESA 200mm x 200mm--it isn't. It's a non-standard size, and the molding in the back makes it even harder to properly attach a mount. I tried three different mounts, and the one that ultimately worked was the Sanus AMF112-B1. (I had to purchase it at Target, but if you can get it on Amazon, all the better.) The mount is adjustable for non-standard sizes, and includes spacers, which you'll need to use.I'm very happy with this TV and would recommend it to others. But if you're going to mount it, save yourself the headache, learn from my experience, and get the Sanus AMF112-B1.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you want a 40 inch tv with 120hz and 1080p, stop your search here", "Author": "MMO Man \"gioacchino\"", "ReviewID": "R3T01H93UWBTWU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I almost didn't buy this set after weeks of research leading up to Thanksgiving. The other negative reviews that I read convinced me I should fork out for a more expensive set.I am sensitive to issues others had with dead pixels or problems, but I had no such issues and can only comment on the tv assuming that you get a unit with no problems.The picture is extremely vibrant and rich. Do I notice some differences with higher end sets in terms of sharpness?  Sure. Is there minimal increased motion blur. Sure. But, honestly, I had to really, really, really focus on the screen and stare for hours to notice anything at all.Additionally, if you are hooking up to a computer, like I did for 1080p gaming in Assassin's Creed 3 and Hitman Absolution, the screen has a special setting for super fast response times for pc usage. Max resolution is also 1920x1080. My games looked amazing in this setting and I was so happy.I purchased this set at Micro Center in Cambridge for $299, although the deal here is good too, although local chains might have even lower pricing.Many of the parts for this set are made by the same factory as Toshiba. To get a set in which you definitely notice a difference in screen quality, I honestly think you would have to spend $700-800.Given I got a TV that, sincerely, I believe is 90% as good for half the price, I am very happy and justify five stars based on quality for the price.I am a big audio/videophile person, but given how inexpensive this was, I thought I would give Westinghouse a try and I'm really happy I did.Two more little notes: I had to play with the brightness/contrast, etc, to get the screen to look its best. This was well worth the effort and you will find many guides that given suggestions. I suggest putting the brightness higher than what you would think and using the cool setting for colors as well as the pc setting for the picture.Finally, I tested the set with a number of friends' HDMI splitters and it worked flawless with all of them.Also, aesthetically the set is very thin and nice looking, installs easily to the base, views well from angles and does not generate much heat.I can't recommend this set enough. Consider pairing it with a Geforce 670 GTX :)", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "No Frills, Crazy Wall Mount, High Value", "Author": "Nerd Alert", "ReviewID": "R1JL8CCUEUL6JB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first HDTV was a Westinghouse, and I was thrilled!  It was around 8 years ago, and things have changed quite a bit.  Standards are higher and prices are lower.  With so many companies trying to get our attention, can Westinghouse still compete in the low end market?BUILDMy first impression of this TV was, \"This is a Westinghouse?  It looks fancy.\"  The bezel is nicely understated and pretty thin, and the TV is very slim considering the low price.  Compared to the Seiki TV I recently reviewed, this TV looks like it is from the future.  It does not look like a $1000+ TV, but it doesn't look cheap.The USB port can't be used for pictures or movies. It is for firmware updates, if the TV ever needs them, and would most likely be used only by a repair technician. The port does provide the 5V signal if you need it for a peripheral such as a USB Wii sensor bar.The Westinghouse I bought 8 years ago was built like a tank.  When it recently died, I took it apart and it was full of thick metal.  Similarly, the stand was very heavy duty.  The stand for the UW40T2BW is pretty flimsy in comparison, though I think it will hold up decently.  The TV does easily wobble and needs to be somewhere very stable, though there is an included hole to screw it to the furniture if that is an option.  My TV stand has a glass top.PICTURE QUALITYIf you want chromaticity diagrams of the standard color spaces, I have uploaded them to the image gallery. If you don't know what they mean, the gist is that the color reproduction is pretty standard to better than average for a low end TV.  However, some areas look a bit blotchy.  This is probably not the panel's inadequacy, but some sort of processing that is done to the picture.  Unfortunately, processing can not be turned off on this TV.  Still, I was very happy with the picture quality for the most part after calibration, and 1080p movies looked great.LCD TVs used to be awful with quick motion, such as a camera panning across a scene.  My old TV left a smeary trail.  This is not an issue with most newer TVs, but still is in some at the lowest price range.  Thankfully, the UW40T2BW had no such issues.  The only problem is that there are no options for the way it converts standard frame rates to 120 Hz (motion interpolation, etc.).  Sound like techno babble?  If you've seen a fancy TV make everything look a bit sped up, you've seen a perhaps overdone version of motion interpolation.  Some people love it after they adapt, while others hate it.  Most TVs have an option to adjust it, but the UW40T2BW has one setting, which is pretty subtle.If you are planning to use a TV as a computer monitor, I think it is worth considering this one.  It has a true 1:1 mode, so there is no issue with overscan.  However, with black text on grey, there is sometimes a garbled color field around the text.  This may be the result of the same processing that makes some imagery look a bit smeared.  It is not an issue for most webpages I viewed.EDIT:  I forgot to mention that this TV has wide viewing angles.  I can look at it from a pretty sharp angle before the picture washes out, and even then it looks pretty good.WALL MOUNTINGI would generally not include anything about mounting in my reviews, since I've mounted many TVs and the process is always the same.  However, looking at the back of this TV will give you an immediate migraine if you are planning to mount it.  It is almost like they intentionally sabotaged anyone who would dare try.  The screw holes are place next to a recessed area, so you won't have access to them without building out some strange structure with spacers.While I'm sure that where there is a will, there is a way, I highly suggest looking elsewhere if you plan to mount your TV.  Even if you figure out a way to do it, it will probably look like a mess.EDIT:  There was a will and a way.  Joshua Merrill wrote a review in which he describes the issues with wall mounting.  The size is not the standard one in Amazon's description.  He found that the Sanus AMF112-B1 did the trick.  If you plan to mount the TV, I suggest reading his review and giving him a helpful vote.  I don't know why Westinghouse made it so difficult/specific, but at least there is a solution.  The downside is that this is not an ultra flush type mount.  Those are both cheap and look really nice on thin TVs like this one.  Ah well.Big_G also let me know that he was able to do it in the comments, and I am hoping he will give us pictures and more information.  His approach seems to be more DIY (just buy longer screws and add spacers/shims until it works).  If you go this route, make sure to properly match the threading of the screws to avoid making a return trip to the hardware store.SOUNDLike most modern HDTVs, the speakers on the UW40T2BW do not point forward, giving the sound an echo.  It is sufficient for basic use and I forgot about it a few minutes into a movie.REMOTEThe remote is very basic. It is not super intuitive and does not light up, but it is okay. It requires pointing at the TV.OVERALLIf you plan to mount your TV, stay away from the UW40T2BW, unless you are looking for a challenge and a trip to the hardware store (but see edit above).  Otherwise, I have been very pleased with the picture, apart from some splotchy color areas here and there.  Motion looks very nice, and the overall package compares very well to other TVs in the same price range.  It is great to see Westinghouse remain competitive.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "size/price sweet spot", "Author": "J-J-J-Jinx!", "ReviewID": "RNKB29YXMVC4X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tv hits the size/price sweet spot. It's big enough for an enjoyable viewing experience in a small to medium bedroom or a small living room or a dorm room, but small enough to keep the price low. The quality is not amazing or anything...you get okay sound (although a separate surround sound system of course would be much better) a pretty good picture and all the basics. Six years ago I purchased a 42\" hdtv and I paid 3 times the MSRP that this one is advertised for (which is more than Amazon's actual price.) My previous tv was a higher quality, it seemed sturdier with a heavy duty construction and was still going strong after six years (when I rehomed it) and had a better warranty (this one is one year for parts and one year \"limited\" for labor) but if you are looking for an \"interim\" tv, something better than what you had before or something for your kids to take away to college (some people may think it's a ridiculous size for that, but for many I think it hits the sweet spot for \"right tv for kids away at college\") while you wait for 1.) your kids to start making their own money or 2.) some of the larger tvs with 3d and smart tv and everything else features to come down in price.What I like about the tv (it's inexpensive and practically disposable) is also what I really don't like about it: a \"disposable tv\", not built to last.

First off it is advertised at 200 x 200 VESA mount, this is a lie! Look up the manual online and it will tell you the mount is 266mm x 275mm! So then you think, well as long as i just get a tilt mount with 2 vertical 'hook' brackets for the back then it shouldn't be an issue, WRONG! The back of the TV has a raised section in the middle where the computer board and TV inputs are located, so majority of the TV is .5\" thick, but then in the middle of the back there is a raised section that is about 1\" - 1.5\" thicker than the rest of the TV. There are inputs on the side and bottom of this raised section. The mounting holes are on the skinny part of the tv, RIGHT NEXT TO THE RAISED SECTION! so you have absolutely no way to get a mounting bracket up against the holes, and even if you could you would be blocking inputs, including the power input! Then you think, well most mounts come with spacers so you should be able to use those, NOPE! this raised area is so much higher that 2 different mounts spacers were not thick enough. So in order to get this mounted I had to go to the hardware store and get PVC pipe to use as spacers, and longer screws to hold the brackets.

Here's what I did:I already had a wall mount from Monoprice. I took the screws that came with it and made sure they fit into the new TV - just to make sure the threading is the same. I went to the hardware store and matched the threading with nuts until I figured out what it was. Once I had the threading, I found:- Four 40mm screws that match the threading of the screws in my wall mount. Mine were \"M6\" (This is simply the ISO metric standard of describing the threading, or if the screw will screw into where you need it to.)- Four 1-inch tall spacers that will work with the screws you just found.Basically, the problem everyone is having with this TV is that the space between the mount point where the screws go in from wall mount brackets of ANY kind is shallow by an inch. You have to resolve this by using (1-inch) spacers, and consequently (1-inch) longer screws. Cost me $5 at a hardware store and a total of 1 hour to get this thing from inside the box to on my wall.

I was seduced by its sleek looks, sultry thin bezel, and brushed grey complexion.Unfortunately when I got home to turn it on, the problems that plague it to this day became apparent :(It's possible I received a bad apple, but given some of the other reviews here, and the problems I've seen people bring up to @WestinghouseTV on twitter, and the now mysteriously vanished Westinghouse Facebook page, I now conclude this might just be a badly designed television not worth anyone's money.To put it in the most relatable sense, this TV acts possessed. It turns on when it feels like it, to the point I have to unplug it before going to bed and to work. Nothing like coming home to a TV blasting (could hear it from when I left the elevator on my floor), that must have turned itself on at some point and had been playing at its loudest volume for hours. It was so loud I felt compelled to apologize to all of my lovely apartment building neighbors for the noise.On top of that, when I do turn it on purposely, it often decides that the channel I've chosen to watch is not the one it wants to play, and changes it. It likes to go channel by channel until it finds something to stop at for a few minutes, before continuing to change channels on its own. I can't decide whether this TV is so bad that I've lost all autonomy as a human, or if it's in fact so good, that it's been programmed to give me the remote-clicking-happy husband I never wanted.And then the volume. This TV is unhappy until the volume is raised the entire way up. It must be pretty excited to show off how good it's sound quality is. If you like your sound turned up all the way up, this TV is for you. For those with more sensible hearing preferences, good luck not getting entirely worked up in a remote war with a TV that ignores all commands and keep the volume up as high as possible. My favorite move is when I click \"mute\" and the TV silences for a second and then laughs in the face, barreling its loud sound at me once again. It's a war I wasn't meant to win.Owning this TV is like owning a Furby, except the Furby was cool for the first 16 hours.Avoid. Run.

I would not pay more than $450 though as I think the engineering is a bit off on this one for mounting purposes. 120hz refresh rate is nice as it creates a little bit smoother picture. Overall I would say this is an extremely nice LOW END tv. If you are a TV guru and want something amazing for friends to gauk at, go with something $1000-$2000 more like a sony as this is not your TV. If you want a good tv to play some video games, or watch some football this is good enough without getting to the 'Walmart\" quality TVs.Picture Quality: Quality is good, lacking in the contrast department a little as its only 4000:1 ratio unlike the false 100k posting on sites. I have it in a very bright room and it fairs well enough that I could not harp on its brightness/contrast issues.Features: I really like the remote even though its super old school/basic. It has favorite channel buttons which works well for my setup since its not connected to a cable box.Looks: Brushed bezel on the front looks really nice, makes it look more expensive than it was. It is also a thin bezel around the edges so it looks sleek and doesn't take a large area for a tv this size. Its also very thin other than the bulge at the bottom and middle on the backside of the TVPorts: I would say avg. to above avg. It has a usb port which some will like for digital cameras, video recorders, 'rail camera's for those hunters out there. Also has 2 HDMI ports which is the lowest amt I would go.Details how I mounted: First of all mounting this specific TV is not for the faint of heart. Luckily I was a little creative and had some tools to make this really simple. Mounted this with the VideoSecu Ultra Slim TV Wall Mount at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GRW1KQ/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00 for under $20. I gave this mount 5 stars and could not rave enough about its awesome engineering. I think the person that engineered this mount should have engineered this TV as its a polar opposite. You have to use 1\" spacers with this TV regardless of the mount because the the back of the TV sticks out too far. Unfortunately this mount only came with .75\" spacers and a trip to the hardware store was needed. Even with the spacers you run into a situation where you cant get your fingers into the coaxial port to screw the cable in. (HDMI is not an issue its on the bottom and doesn't require spinning.) Thus, my solution was to make (i'm sure they sell them cheap somewhere) a 3\" coaxial extension for the cable with a female-female connector to extend out of the blocked area from the mount and basically make it easier to connect to the cable, I did that first before I put hte mounting bracket on which covers up the ports and then makes it difficult to get to.If you use this mount  you will need 2 people to hang it at the end of the install - 1 person to hold the TV close to the cords, and another to make all the connections BEFORE you hang it. Reason being is that its so close to the wall that you cant get your hands in to make the connections and the bulge in the back bottom part of the tv blocks our fingers.That said, I liked having it this close to the wall because it looks really nice and professional when complete. Mounted, the VERY FRONT part of the tv is still only 3.5\" from the wall (thats with mounting hardware+spacers+thickness of TV). That is very awesome if you consider a lot of other mounts/tvs as some tvs are 3.75\" thick and they call that slim. Also this mount has side caps on the side to leave a nice side profile view of the bracket, versus jagged edges and metal being seen.Last thing to mention is that I referenced this mount so much because I couldn't believe how perfect it matched up with this tv down to the little things like: vertical bars do not stick out and work perfect with the bottom bulge on tv, width of the horizontal bracket is minimal but enough to suit, i did a pull-up (185lbs) on the bracket so I know it will hold a 30lbs tv, and it has quick release pull tabs to easily remove the tv for readjustment if needed all for under $20!!!!!!K- now back to watching Big Bang Theory on my new Westinghouse TV :)", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "tv turns on by it self", "Author": "Inderpal Singh", "ReviewID": "R1A8TMVWQWE0UC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this tv is possessed. it worked fine for the first couple of months. and now it urns on by it self???it does it even with the autosource feature turned off", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Stopped working in four months", "Author": "Brian A.

As a computer monitor, this is one of the best I have tried.  There is a feature in the menu to turn off the Overscan, which means it exactly duplicates a PC monitor (no cut off edges).  Text is easy to read in the TV's native resolution of 1900x1080* Slim bezel.  Eyeballed, it looks smaller than my other 40-inch TVs but its viewable area is not. It just has a very attractive slim bezel that makes the overall dimensions of the TV smaller.* Very good sound system by Yamaha, including Surround Sound 3D.  Also, if you elect to hook this TV to an external sound source you can completely turn off the TV speakers in the menu (as opposed to muting them).* Matte finish screen.  I personally prefer this for gaming TV and computer monitor.  However, this means the colors are not quite as rich looking as what you would see on a glossy screen TV.  This is my personal observation.  Just saying.* Great menu features for a basic TV, such as Overscan control, TV speakers ON/OFF.* Remote features 8 buttons for all the input modes, as well as a single button that needs to be cycled.  The 8 buttons are much easier.Dislikes:* No paper manual in the box.  It's on a DVD (included).* HDMI inputs are on the back center and under a lip.  Cables connect in an awkward 'upward' direction.* Remote control has limited IR range and angle.  You have to be directly in front of the TV.* For the life of me, I can't get this TV to maintain the correct date and time settings.  Is it because it's not connected to a cable box/antenna and used primary as a playback/gaming monitor?  Don't know, but the clock is never correct.  Not a big deal for me.Overall, I really like this TV for my gaming and second computer monitor.  I prefer the matte screen for where I have this TV located (opposite a window), but other people have other opinions.  I agree that a glossy screen makes colors look richer, but I still think (to my eye) that this TV as a pretty nice picture once tweaked out to my preferences.

I know that Westinghouse does not have the best reliability in the industry....but so far I love it.Features: The TV has a great look to it. It is sleek and does not look cheap at all.  The stand is not like steel....but it will surely hold the TV for it's lifetime. It does not wobble and I am not concerned at all.Sound: All flat screens leave a lot to be desired in this area.....however...the sound is more than adequate. I never have to raise the volume past halfway and the sound quality is decent.RCA Audio Out Jacks: This is a must for me because sometimes I run this through my very high end stereo for movies or music concerts. Very few flat screens have this feature anymore. The trend is the little pin jack for computer speakers. I needed the RCA jacks and the sound is amazing. No noise like some reviewers have noted.I do have all my electronics gear protected by electrical conditioners and surge suppressors (monster power). This is something everyone should invest in for the life of any valued component.......period.Picture:  Out of the box.....the picture was very good......but I was not blown away. I learned that all manufactures \"crank up\" the video settings so that when a consumer views it in the store.....it will \"pop\" compared to the other brands. However in the home....in a much darker setting.....those settings are not realistic. All high def TV's have to be calibrated......period. Their capabilities far exceed what we are capable of without calibration tools. I invested in Disney's \"World Of Wonder\" TV setup disc. There are many discs out there....but Disney's seems to be the benchmark for home use. This must be played on a Blue ray player, but it comes with many test patterns and a color filter that you look through to adjust the color.After calibrating the TV...the picture is breathtaking!  If it were any better....the actors would be sitting in your lap!  I do not see how to obtain a better picture...regardless of price. It is seamless, smooth and almost looks 3-D. Best Buy charges $299 dollars to come to your home and perform a calibration!  That's how important it is!  I paid $15 for the disc......no brainer.Remote:  The remote is not the simplest or friendliest.....however it appears to be well made and it works!Summary: For this price.....this TV is simply amazing.

I suppose I should state this isn't an issue of me not being capable with website navigation/phone menu navigation etc I'm generally the person people call to do this kind of stuff when they're having trouble with it, I'm in my 20's and I've used the Internet since 14.4 dial up back in the early to mid 90's and have worked in offices and in tech support I'm pretty fluent in obscure automated phone menus and website navigation.Updated, dropping rating to 1 star which is unfortunately only partially the products issue and mostly Westinghouses but since it directly relates to the functionality of the product I'm left giving it 1 star. As stated in my original review I over all liked the product and I did end up straightening out the calibration to get a very nice picture out of this set. I however tried to hook my HD antenna up to this TV and was prompted with a need to enter an activation code to enable the tv tuner, I went to their website as it suggested and found that on 3 different browsers there is no way to enter information to activate via the website despite it clearly indicating that there is an easy way to activate. I then tried the automated cellphone text message system which responded to the initial inquiry then the only response given after that regardless of what was sent to it was that I needed to goto the website or call the 1-800 number. I called the 1-800 number and their automated system told me to goto the website then hung up on me. I called back and tried to speak with a representative, I was on hold for 30 minutes then sent to a voicemail... on hold with no indication of how long I would be on hold or even any sort hold music or anything to indicate I was in fact still on hold just dead silence broken every 10 minutes by an automated voice telling me that most problems can be solved by going to their website. Calling back again gave me a busy signal at 2 in the afternoon in their time zone, which would be the first time I've even gotten a busy signal off a 1-800 number from a large company. Calling back again put me on hold for 16 minutes then hung up on me. So I ignored the information given on the TVs setup wizard and looked on the website for different contact info, website lists the same phone number as the TV but also supplies an e-mail so I sent my information to the suggested e-mail and was sent a code within a few minutes without any issues at all the TV says this code is invalid but the e-mail did promptly return a code anyways. I probably could keep wasting my time on this but since I'm still waiting on a response from the e-mail I sent trying to find out if this model allows 120hz to be turned on/of I'm opting to return it before something else happens that requires me to attempt to deal with customer service again since it seems your options are broken automated systems or voicemail as there don't seem to be any actual humans to respond to e-mails or answer phones.ORIGINAL REVIEW:General unboxing impressions: As with some other reviewers I was surprised by the general appearance of the TV the nearly non existent faux brushed metal (actually plastic but looks nice) bezel around the screen with the solid metal back this TV looks expensive.Assembly: Then you put the stand on... stand looks pretty standard when it's sitting still and I'm not concerned about the TV toppling over as the absolute stability seems fine but the slightest tap or bump will make the entire TV wobble and you can literally bend the ends of the stand using no effort at all with your fingers, there is a metal plate in the center that supports where the screws go up into the TV and the forward back stability seems fine it's simply quite wobbly side to side. The stand is also smooth shiny plastic which is in contrast to the faux brushed metal of the bezel that sits a couple inches above it... it looks pretty mismatched like your tv came without a stand so you just went with whatever you found that happened to bolt up to it.Remote: The remote is among the cheapest looking I've ever seen as well, it appears out of place by a couple decades at least... like they just were figuring out plastic so it's all sharp edges and boxy design none of the sleek sexy curves of modern remotes. It also feels a little backwards because the thick end is the front and the thin end the rear which is the reverse of I'm pretty certain any remote I've ever used in my life... The buttons are interesting as well since about 80% are labeled with words or numbers and the other 20% switch to sometimes bizarre symbols such as the \"Menu\" button which is what appears to be lined cornerless paper that mysteriously has a mouse cursor on it. The remote also isn't faux brushed metal or shiny plastic it's just dull matte slightly textured plastic so it matches neither the bezel nor the stand.Screen: Screen is fantastic looking not too shiny that it reflects everything and not so dull that it looks bad. It fits the bezel perfectly with the high end appearance.First impressions turning it on: I have a dead pixel, it's the first thing I specifically check during the black screen before I even set up the inputs. My dead pixel happens to be about a 1/2 centimeter or so from the right side in the middle of the screen and it's 1 single pixel not an entire pixel cluster as is common. It's completely unnoticeable unless you're within 1-2 feet of the screen and are specifically looking for it so I basically have no dead pixels since it's completely impossible to see from any distance you would be viewing from.Inputs: love/hate with input placement. I can be a pain to plug in HDMI's because they're on the bottom of the back instead of a side as most I've hooked up are. The advantage to them being on the bottom though is they are completely out of the way and you can hook and unhook all the other random connections without messing with the ones that are pretty much always left in 24/7. You can also run the HDMI cables whichever direction you want without any problems because they start out headed straight down.Sound: No idea, use externals. Will update if I ever get around to testing the built-in speakers.Picture: this would be my main complaint, It's not specifically a bad picture it just requires a ton of calibration and tweaking to not be a bad picture... the defaults out of the box are some of the worst I've ever dealt with, you can literally change them all by just 1 click and very dramatically improve the picture. To get a good picture you have to change them by a lot more than 1 click but the fact that simply 1 click dramatically improves it makes me wonder why the defaults are so bad in the first place. Expect to spend some serious time tweaking this to your liking, I spent about an hour with some basic calibration images and am now pretty happy with the picture but it still seems off. This isn't me being overly picky about it being perfect either, this is the first TV I've ever had that I spent more than a few minutes messing with the settings to get a picture I was happy with. After spending an hour with this one I'm still at the point of looking at it and thinking it needs more calibration, it's pretty good at this point but still needs work. The clarity of the image is great but the colors, brightness, contrast, etc all need significant calibration before it looks even close to right.Over all, I'm pretty satisfied with the purchase assuming it doesn't die in a couple months or something the 4 star rating will stand. The review seems somewhat negative but I should state the stand and remote and such don't bother me, I would much rather more manufacturers focus on the main use of the product and ignore the peripherals, a TV is a screen for me anything else is bonus. I like the nice bezel because it's essentially part of the screen so doesn't hurt that it looks good as well, the stand the remote, whether the speakers are good or not doesn't matter to me since those aren't what I notice on a TV I'm generally busy watching the screen and it's the only thing I can't easily fix by buying some other cheap product to supplement it. I may lower the rating if after further calibration the picture still looks off as it may simply be that the color gamut on the screen is not capable of providing an accurate image in which case 4 stars seems too high. For now though I'm assuming it's calibration since every basic calibration thing I've done so far has continued to improve the image more and more to the point that it currently looks quite good, so it seems likely that it's just an issue of needing to get the right calibration for it to look even better and not any inability of the hardware to produce a truly fantastic picture.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great bang for your buck", "Author": "skaughtz", "ReviewID": "R1RQK4PS0T0N4Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I saw this TV on sale for $300 on Cyber Monday, I pounced on it.  Now that I have opened it up and tested it, even at the $370 it is currently selling for it is absolutely worth it.  Check around and you'll see that it is hard to find a television with these features at this price (especially LED-backlit and at 120Hz).Some people are concerned about buying \"off brands,\" and rightfully so, because you tend to get what you pay for.  However, televisions are manufactured very similar to computer components.  That is, there are really only a few manufacturers that produce all of the inner workings of TVs, both name brand and off brand.  For instance, this particular model of Westinghouse is the same as Toshiba.  Emerson is the same as Samsung.  Etc.  Quality control is the same for all makes and models when they are leaving the factory.  The only real benefit to buying a name brand television is that you get a longer warranty, more innate features (many of which you probably won't need/use), and a better aesthetic look that conveys that this is a Sony, darn it.But now a quick run down of the important aspects:-Picture:  You will not find a better picture unless you are willing to spend several hundreds of dollars more than the cost of this model.  Even then, unless you are extremely particular about your A/V equipment, I'm not sure how much of an improvement you would notice.  The first thing I do with a new television is turn on the first sport I can find in HD to see how clear and crisp the picture is.  At 120Hz there was no lag to the soccer game I was watching and the picture was great.  Football should look beautiful.-LED Backlight:  LCD televisions are typically lit in one of two ways: Light-Emitting Diode (LED) or Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL).  CCFL is cheaper to produce, less reliable, has a shorter lifespan, consumes more energy and produces more heat than LED.  The CCFL is often what goes up first in a television.  This model has LED.  Score one for the $300 television.-Sound:  Is it THX surround sound?  No.  Should it suffice perfectly for the average person?  Yes.  Sound quality is really a subjective thing... some people still prefer vinyl over CDs.  I think the sound on this television is fine, and really no different from other televisions I have owned.  If you want huge sound, there is an entire industry dedicated to fulfilling your audio needs.-Stand:  I don't like this design.  It is plenty study enough, but it requires the television to be horizontal in order to mount the stand.  Four long screws connect the stand to the television.  A tongue and groove method (or something similar) would have been much simpler, but I'm just nitpicking.Would I purchase this television again?  Absolutely.  If you are considering it I suggest that you do the same.  You simply aren't going to find these options at this price anywhere else.  Or, you can pay much, much more for a name brand logo on the front of the television.

No luck! I don't understand how they screwed this up. Really defeats the point of audio over HDMI although without commercials it's not too irritating.

These sets are perfect for bedrooms, and family rooms. For a large living room I go with Panasonic, Sony etc. for more inputs, and flexibility.Westinghouse improved the speakers in there sets by going with Yamaha, that would be the only knock on my 5 year old LCD. The speakers were just ok, where as with this LED theyre very good. No flat screen made has great speakers anyway in my opinion, so you can always go the soundbar/amp route.Ive seen reviews stating wall mounting problems.....i dont wall mount these so I cant comment on that.

Not only is the TV as slim as advertised (& much less weight than a comparable LCD TV), it has a nice aesthetic.  The Westinghouse \"W\" is not too large and, when on, there is a small red light that is underneath the logo (it doesn't have the logo glow on the front like many TVs).THE GOOD1. The picture is good - good color & good contrast/brightness - not washed out.2. The menu set up is easy to operate.3. Hook-up to a digital antenna was a breeze & the TV recognized all of the available digital channels (I have to go online to get a code to input into the TV in order to get this done, though).4. Hook-up to a Roku was easyTHE NOT SO GOOD1. The remote is smallish & lightweight with a lot of buttons crammed together.  It isn't the greatest remote.2. While the stand has a large spread, and there are 4 screws in the base of the TV, the stand is wobbly and the TV really needs to sit on a solid surface.3. The back of the TV needs a new design.  Not only are the mount holes in a poor location (you are going to need a wall mount that has spacers), the power plug is at the top of all of the other inputs (my other TVs have the power location near the bottom & away from the rest of the inputs).  Additionally, the power isn't just a plug - it has an ac/dc adapter that will need to be secured to something because it probably won't reach the ground.4. The sound is OK. The speakers are behind the TV, so the sound is muffled.  When running on a treadmill, I have to push the sound to the limit & it is still a little soft. In comparison, a 37\" Vizio only needs to have the sound at under halfway in order for me to hear it well.Even with the \"Not So Good\", I like the TV.

My mind works better in pros in cons so I'll list it out for you.Cons:- The audio is terrible. From the middle of the volume level to its peak, there is little to no change. There is no headphone jack to plug in smaller external speakers, so I bought a stereo (red and white) cable adapter to plug in my own speakers. Even after that, the TV cannot control the volume of the external speakers like you would want it to. I have no clue why they didn't just make a mini input for headphones.- At first my TV would change inputs by itself. Like, literally change by itself with nothing touching it. It was embarrassing to have company over, be watching a movie through an HDMI input, and all of a sudden the screen starts showing regular TV channels. My girlfriend advised me to replace it, but the TV is so large that I didn't want to go through the hassle. I'm glad I let it work that kink out because it hasn't done it since the end of 2012.- My TV seems to have some kind of static, phantom thing going on with the buttons. Hovering your finger near the volume, power, etc. buttons causes them to activate and act as if you are actually touching them. It's pretty annoying, I wish they would have just made solid buttons to press to negate this issue.-  The connections are a hassle to get to because they are both on the back and under a portion of the TV set. Not a big deal unless you plan on moving a lot of cables around.-  If you like total darkness, you won't be able to see the remote because there is no glow-in the dark feature for it.Pros:- You can't beat the nearly $200 price difference between this TV and a \"name-brand\".- It has a great picture and really allows a good contrast at times.- Multiple HDMI ports.- The TV is sleek and really blends in well in a contemporary room. It's impressive and really doesn't scream \"I'm not a Samsung\".Overall, I'd say buy it, test drive it, and see if it fits. It's worked well for me and I've owned it since December 2012.

I was looking to replace an RCA 32\" 720p LCD display in my computer room which had a decent picture but was a little small for watching hockey games which was my primary purpose for purchasing this TV.After getting it SUPER FAST and in perfect working condition setup was a breeze with only the base to attach and batteries to put in the remote and plug in the connections and boom you're watching tv in no time.  On screen setup was quick and easy (except for the ATSC digital tv channel scan which requires you to visit Westinghouse's website to gain an unlock code to activate the digital tuner for some reason - seems silly to me).I watched a few programs of varying types, sports, movies, bright content, dark content and noticed a couple of things compared to my Samsung displays.Default settings are pretty good for contrast/brightness optimization if you use the Video Presets to select between SHOWROOM, MOVIE, GAME, SPORTS.  Each has their own ups and downs but after tweaking the settings based on what I was watching, I usually only went a few clicks off their start points to find what was pleasing to me.The 3 star rating comes from a few primary reasons;1) Contrast is majorly exaggerated even set to about 30% of max2) Brightness levels will not produce a legit white without graying up the black levels.3) Cable/Satellite content shows it's flaws in spades.I thought LED would be able to produce a little better white while not losing the blacks with a better contrast ability but as soon as you turn up the contrast (or even use the SHOWROOM or SPORTS settings) you get blooming of the bright details and they wash out.  Darks are SO DARK that it looks like everything is muddied.  Turning off DYNAMIC CONTRAST in the Video Options will help this a little, but it still is a problem with this panel display.My 5 year old 50\" 720p Plasma display beats the pants off this 40\" LED 1080p and just to compare I even hooked up the same content to the 23\" LCD to compare and it was far better on contrast/brightness and detail.More downside;- Color reproduction is not \"true\".  There are 3 color temperature settings and the presets all use a different one. MOVIE uses the warm and over-reddens everything so white becomes pinkish/orange. Cool casts a blue hue and neutral is pretty good but noticeable darker so you end up trading off detail for color. I ended up using Cool the most because I wanted more brightness without losing detail in the super high contrast.- Room settings. There are 3 backlit levels on and easy button on the top left where you can select from DARK ROOM, MEDIUM, BRIGHT ROOM.  Bright room is the only setting that comes close to producing a real white and ends up being the best setting all the time. I tested the contrast/blooming issue with Medium thinking that may help but it didn't which tells me the contrast ratio spec is nothing but number when you can't use even a third of the contrast without losing details in the washout.The upside;- 1080p content looks amazing. The detail is better than any other set. I loaded up the Tron Legacy Blu-Ray to see how full HD content looked and found myself wondering if this is the same TV I was struggling with earlier in the day to find a good setting. The default GAME setting looked incredible with only needing a -1 or -2 nudge of brightness down and actually taking contrast up to 50% without losing any detail to blooming.  Blacks were black, dark greys were still detailed, and the colors jumped off the screen.It seems this display excels are displaying FULL HD content but struggles with processing compressed information (DirecTV and upscaled content). Some channels look phenomenal, some look crappy.  Live NBC broadcast of PGA Golf normally looks incredible on my Plasma, but on this set the color was way oversaturated (Tiger Wood's red golf polo looked like a big red blob with not fine detail of his shirt coming through) and no matter how much I turned down the color and contrast, it just has blooming issues even when the whites were looking gray from being turned down.  So my conclusion is while the tv may feel like a bargain for price/specs, it struggles to keep up with expectations unless you're going to just watch 1080p content.  It's not horrible, but you will certainly feel like you settled for a 2nd tier quality display after comparing it to the pricier alternatives if you look at it side by side.By ALL MEANS, do not use the SHOWROOM setting for watching satellite/cable.My takeaway is this is a learning experience.  I wondered if LED LCD displays had closed the gap on plasma and based on this, I don't think they have. Between black levels, white whites, and smooth color reproduction, plasma is still the champ in my book (and better for fast moving sports as even this 120hz has some noticeable blurring compared to 600hz plasma).  So for a secondary display with very little power consumption and long life expectation, it's good enough, but better suited for watching video games or Blu-Ray movies than anything else.  If I had a chance to do it over, I probably would go back and purchase a 42\" 720p plasma closeout on sale.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT TV FOR THE MONEY!", "Author": "Rome", "ReviewID": "R1G7NXN9WB78PQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this TV to put in my bedroom, for streaming netflix and some light gaming!

Tabor \"Interested Party\"", "ReviewID": "R16IKV6W3HDF18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV after reading the feedback from other users.  After shopping around, it was clear that this was a good overall value when compared to other TV's especially smart TV's with embedded internet channel access.  For the money, with 120mhz refresh rates, this sounded like it was a great buy.I was concerned about reviews that indicated some owners had problems with their units soon after purchasing it, so bought the extended warranty to be safe and still paid less than comparable TV's from the likes of Sony, LG, etc.  We've had it installed for 3 months now and no issues.  The TV works great, provides excellent graphics, contrast, and color.  Still 33 months to go on the extended warranty so if something does go wrong, we're covered.  However, from the other writeups I'd seen, if you didn't have a problem soon after the purchase, you would most likely be fine so I'm not expecting anything else to go wrong.The TV generally has a very slim profile and looks really sharp.  I bought a square swivel wall mount for the TV as we mounted it in a corner and the standard square fittings didn't fit due to the way the back of the unit bumps out.  However, I was able to stack a couple of the spacers and bought 3 PVC fittings 1\" diameter and 3/4\" high and mounted the TV with these spacers in 3 corners between the bracket and the TV.  The screws were just long enough to reach so no other special fitting was required.  One corner fit tighter than the others and that's where I used the stacked spacers that came with the TV.  It worked perfectly and you can't see anything unusual so I'm happy with the way it worked out.  We're using HDTV from an Antenna and get 12 channels with 480-1080i/p quality and all look great.  We watched the Super Bowl on it and other athletic events and the graphics are super!  We're also using Hulu+ and Netflix which are fed from a Roku box!  It's working great!  Tied the sound into my stereo system and have excellent surround sound.We highly recommend this TV as a great buy for it's size.

Using the cinema setting does provide a good picture if you don't want to play with the settings.I do find that the dynamic contrast ratio works well.  I read reviews for and against using this setting but on this TV it works well.  I prefer it.  It is off by default out of the box.Sound is good.The remote is simple but functional.Settings are basic but good enough.The picture is beautiful! People pop out of the screen.This TV with 120 Hz works so much better than the 60 Hz Samsung it replaced.  No more blurring during sports.Very thin and light TV.  As other reviewers have commented the build quality is excellent and the TV chassis makes it look like a much more expensive TV.Cons:This is why only 4 stars.  Our Comcast HD box has HD and non HD channels.  Sometimes when we change back and forth from HD to a non HD channel the TV gets confused and hangs up.  We have to shut the TV off and turn it on for it to reset. Annoying but we can go days between It happening.

We don't have cable or satellite but frequently use Netflix or similar on our pc.This year, we decided to finally get a new tv.  We set a price and specs, then said we would buy one as soon as a TV showed up meeting those requirements.  This TV met those with a lightening deal, and I was lucky.Easy to put together, very sleek looking.  We didn't do a wall mount.When viewing a full 1080p stream from Netflix or itunes (we got an Apple TV to go with it), this TV is IMO indistinguishable from the Samsung TVs we saw at the mall.  Lower quality streams look fine too, just not HD.  Sound is fine too.The interface on the TV is adequate, not fancy.  Cannot pull up a network TV guide like I could with my old CRT TV and converter box, but perhaps I haven't looked hard enough.  The remote is not great and requires a concentrated point at the TV, but no biggie since I typically use the Apple TV anyway, controlled with my iPhone.

During that time; the remote died; then the TV would lose its memory when turned off, requiring you go through the setup process again; and finally the TV itself died needed replacing.During this period I contacted Westinghouse support online and directly by phone. Their support is one of the lousiest I have experienced. Their goal appears to be to get you off the phone or close the support ticket as quickly as possible without necessarily resolving the problem. Sometimes it would take a week to get a response to a support ticket, if you call them you'll be told someone will call you back, and they never do.In order to return the TV to be repaired, I had to send everything back, including the stand (so don't throw that away, even if you are wall mounting it). They will not cross ship a TV (even if you put a credit card number on file), so you'll need the box and be prepared to be without a TV for a while. Our repair (which ended up being a refurbished replacement TV) took just under 4 weeks (3 days shipping to them, 6 days from being signed for on their dock to being acknowledged as received by them, 2 weeks for the 'repair', and 3 days back to me). It could have taken longer had I not badgered their RMA team constantly to get the TV back ASAP.The bad:The VESA mounts require extended posts and bolts as they as set back about an inch from the back of the TV.If you remove the stand to wall mount the TV, then the power LED is not visible, The TV takes about 3 seconds to power on (it's like molasses) and you have no idea if the TV is starting up or it didn't get the remote signal.Very slow power up time, about 3 seconds before the \"Westinghouse\" logo appears.External power supply.Ugly remote.Poor reliability.Poor customer support.Slow repair/replacement processThe good:Picture is what you would expect for a TV at this price.

I agree with other reviewers stop here if you want 120Hz led.  I got this TV for our outdoor patio.  I blindly bought this mount http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GTT0VO/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01 , which as I now, I know it does not fit.  I HAD to have an articulating mount because I have a need for multiple viewing areas.  Well I customized the mount.  Very simple now that you have someone to tell you the steps, if you have a drill and hacksaw :].I cut 4 - 3.5 inch long 1/4 aluminum plate, It was 2 inches wide.  I then drilled 2 - 1/4 inch holes exactly 2 inches apart at dead center of the holes.  I then affixes those pieces to the mount with small 1/2 inch nuts and bolts, with the nuts closest to the wall.  I also had those custom plates on the side of the mount that was closest to the wall.  I then bought 4 m6 screws that were about 1.5 inches long, along with 4 - 1 inch plastic spacers and mounted the TV with the help of my wife and child.

This TV replaced my primary aging 42in Vizio Plasma (720p) tv.  I have always taken a chance with lesser known brands, as with enough research and comparison you will find that most can compare with higher end models.Pros:Easy SetupPicture (1080P looks stunning)Design (Thin sleek bezel, with non intrusive company logo.  Does not look like a knockoff TV)Cons:Tuner - Didnt have any issues with the activation procedures, nor did that bother me; however channels frequently display the channel issue when the selected station alters their resolution.  For instance going from a High Def football game to a low-def commercial causes the channel information to be displayed in the top right.  This could be an issue with some local channels, as this was not experienced on all channels.Picture - The picture overall was stunning, but out of the box the brightness was a little dull to my taste.  Utilizing a THX optimization disk I was able to tweak the brightness / contrast with no issues.  Out of the box the brightness was set to low and the contrast was set to high.  I also preferred the color temperature to be set to cool instead of warm.  I highly recommend that anyone who complains of the picture settings to utilize a optimization dvd when calibrating their tv.Lack of inputs - TV only has two HDMI inputs, which isnt a huge deal.  There is no component inputs.Variable Audio / Video out - I do not utilize the internal speakers, as with any TV especially the real thin ones its near impossible to put good speakers inside a confined space.  What I found is that the audio/video out utilizing the old RCA cables (white / red) is controlled directly by the volume on the TV.  When I first hooked up the surround sound I had to turn it all the way up for it to even be at a comfortable level, so I figured something wasn't right.  Its always recommended you turn off the internal speakers, which this TV does have that feature; however when the internal speakers are off the TV volume in un-adjustable.  The solution to this issue was to turn to something with no sound.  Crank the volume all the way up and then disable / turn off the internal speaker.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Westinghouse 40 in led 120hz hdtv", "Author": "MatthewHawk", "ReviewID": "RD1ERVPMON8O5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing hdtv.
