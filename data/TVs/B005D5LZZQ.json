I sold TV's at best buy (non commission) for over a year. The small (yet noticeable to some people) differences you want to look out for are the refresh rates and the type of engine the TV is using (like a video card for computers). That is what makes or breaks a TV. Yes contrast is important but every company sets their standards for contrast ratio. What the heck does that mean? It means this: say you have 2 TV's side by side and they are the exact TV. Same materials everything. One is made by pita company and one by I dunno stone. (Made up companies) now one company says \"this TV can show 5000 colors\" but the other company wants to sell their TV so they say it has 7500 colors. Unless someone decides to count every shade then who can prove this wrong? So many times I saw the Sony or Samsung or even sharp TV rate their colors under 2000 and the cheap knockoffs say 5000 but when you look at the better TV it is night and day difference (better). People don't know better and want higher numbers so companies make the number bigger. Quality screen.. video processors.. that is what matters. You can't put a jet engine in a 1980's small plane and expect to go 400 miles an hour. The contrast is more likely 1500 to 1 but I will say that when I sold TV's that sharp, Samsung and Sony are top QUALITY (instead of brand) I hope this helps people not fall in the trap of a big number printed on a piece of shiny paper.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money", "Author": "Lanie", "ReviewID": "R2YRXGX8EJQWQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV a year ago and I love it!  I got it at Best Buy for $430.00 on a great sale.  It has 4 HDMI outputs/inputs, not 3 as this article suggests and the sound is phenomenal.  Seriously, my boyfriend is jealous of my TV!  I'm extremely picky about my electronics, but not having $1200 to drop on any one item, I choose carefully and I'll tell you what, not once have I been disappointed.  This 42 inch replaced my LG 32 inch which is now in my bedroom and the contrast is awesome!  Great picture, great sound, all around great TV and worth much more than I paid for it.  Buy one and you'll see!", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Budget LCD TV", "Author": "Vassilena", "ReviewID": "RQYA4UU043FSH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far this Television has given me a year and a half of trouble free enjoyment. After doing a week of research and trying to look for a TV under $400 and around 40-42\", this one came up. Purchased it at BestBuy for $350 and like it a lot. Great picture quality and resolution.There are only two downsides to this television: 1. The sound. Tinny speakers and 2. Picture seems to be a little too too dark at times. For these two reasons,I will give this TV a 4 instead of 5 stars.Other than that, this is an excellent television and in my onion, Sharp is a fine manufacturer of TVs.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent 42\" TV for the Price but with 1 Drawback", "Author": "ShifrinD", "ReviewID": "RGXKBHG2WFT8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV (Sharp LC42SV49U for over a year now and have put it through many paces.  I've watched movies (regular and Blu-Ray HD), played video games (PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360), and watched a variety of TV and HD TV channels. All in all, it's a fantastic TV for the price!  It has GREAT sound, a LOT of HDMI inputs and a good variety of AV & Component inputs, as well.  That one drawback?  It's a bit lacking in audio output.  There is only 1 option to connect the TV to an external audio system (i.e. home theater system), and it uses an old style PCM digital audio out; there is no option for a regular two cable audio out option.  But again, this is a relatively minor drawback because 1) the sound system in the TV itself is excellent, and 2) most home theater systems are designed to be the main conduit for sound & video to and from the TV set. It's a great all-around TV!!", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice", "Author": "Vg", "ReviewID": "R2UF7004E43KJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like thus tv.

Which one is correct? In my experiences at looking at contrast ratios only a LCD-LED TV can give you such a high contrast ratio of 5000000:1, which this model is not. Please do not think Amazon.com did this on purpose, I am positive they did not. it's just an unintentional error.  I have shopped with Amazon.com for 5+ years and have found them to be very honest and always have the very best of products for great prices and the customer service has been excellent, and I will always go to Amazon.com first for products I am looking for because they are such a reputable site and shopping with them has always been a very pleasant experience.
