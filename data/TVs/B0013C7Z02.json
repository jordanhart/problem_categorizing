We've always had a TV in our kitchen and this was just getting so old to where I couldn't even see the picture anymore it just seemed to dark or something. It also seemed as if it was too small especially compared to our nice big flat screen in our living room. So I was searching for a replacement TV for our kitchen but I didn't want to pay an arm & leg for it because it wasn't something that was going to be used all that often as it was only the 2 of us now. So this was perfect for the price. My daughter set it up before my husband even got home from work. The remote was a little tricky to set up with our Dish at first so I left that up to my husband. The only thing that I don't like and I don't know if it's the TV or if its the Dish...but when we're watching the news for instance we can't see all the writing on the bottom because its too big for the screen so we have to switch the mode to a letterbox for that TV and when we go upstairs and watch our TV in our bedroom we have to switch it back to normal so we see it all again. But overall its a really nice TV at a great price. Speedy delivery too. I really didn't expect it for like a week but it came in like 4 days I was amazed. I'd recommend this TV to anyone.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "unsatisfied", "Author": "Jill", "ReviewID": "R1BCMHKLL5SJS3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After six weeks this TV is not working.
