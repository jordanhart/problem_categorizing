{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV - Great Service", "Author": "Jimmy D", "ReviewID": "R3I83PRJPHBNDP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered this TV from Amazon on Sunday night October 22. It was delivered on Thursday, October 26. It came direct from Amazon and had free shipping. It's strange, sometimes Amazon has it, and sometimes it's available from a 3rd party. In any event, I paid $1,999 with free shipping. The delivery was prompt and arrived in excellent condition.My son works with ESPN as a Technical Director and he helped me select the TV. He's a technical whiz at this stuff. We visited several stores and looked at various makes. He was trying to steer me to a DLP but I didn't like the narrow viewing angle and it would not have suited my room. I originally wanted a 42\" plasma but discovered I had to stick to a 40\" since my TV room is somewhat small. We finally narrowed it down to Toshiba, Sony, & Panasonic. Because I needed a 40\", I had to go to an LCD or the Panny 37\" plasma, which to me was too small.Not sorry I went LCD. I has no screen glare or burn-in problems, although I understand the plasmas now have the burn-in under control. And, it seems I sacrificed nothing as far as the picture quality goes. We finally chose the Samsung. The Samsungs have it over the other TV's in the same price range both for features and picture quality. We were almost going to get the LN-S4092D, but then we saw this model which has 1080p capability. While not being used now, it is a feature for the future. Also, look for a unit with dual HDMI inputs. You may not need both now, but you will like it later. When you go into a store, first thing is to tone down the TV's you're looking at. They have them cranked up to max contrast & brightness. Usually the sets will have a \"movie\" viewing mode. Change it to that. If they don't have that, cut the contrast and brightness to at least 60-75%, the sharpness to 10% or less, and the color temp to a \"warm\" setting. That will tone it down to a good level tha will allow you to see the TV's real capabilities. Then, have the salesman put a real SD signal through it. Not a pre-recorded looped signal that splits the screen HD/SD. On some of those they exagerate the SD bluriness to make the HD look better.This Samsung has a great SD picture. Yes, it's not HD, but it's very acceptable and not much worse than my old CRT TV. The HD picture is fabulous. I am in NJ and we have Comcast Digital cable with a DVR. I was watching the World Series last night and when they had a close up of the pitcher, you could count his wiskers. The side-to-side viewing fades a little when you get too far, but it's not real noticable and who watches from that extreme angle anyway? The swivel stand helps.The sound is good TV sound. It's not home-theater quality, but it's good. It has a built-in graphic equalizer so you can customize the sound you like. The other thing that I liked about this TV is the limited surround. It made the overall size a little smaller than the other 40\" units which helped me out considerably as I mentioned earlier. And the gloss \"piano black\" gives it a classy look. Nicer than the silver. I didn't give it a 5 rating, because I just got it, and to me nothing is perfect. There is always room for improvement. But, I love it. A great choice.", "Date": "October 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Looks Great!", "Author": "Timothy Wintemberg \"AeroHead\"", "ReviewID": "R23I6VFV1LMFA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this HDTV for about two weeks and I love it.  I toured various retailers looking at many models before I decided on this unit.  To me it looked better than any other model than perhaps one higher-priced (by +$600) top of the line Sony which looked marginally better.HD programming looks absolutely fantastic especially since I also got a Comcast HD DVR hooked up as well.  Broadcast TV looks very good although occasionally certain ads, programs or channels may have more noise (relative to either bandwidth set by digital cable company or original video source settings). Interestingly, the one or two noisy channels (I believe the fault lies with the cable company, not this TV) look better if I switch my input from HDMI to the pass-through coaxial input--this gives a slight fuzz to the image, but largely gets rid of the noise.Having worked with/ dealt with/ numerous plasma screens over the last 4 years at work, I am wary of claims that they have overcome burn-in issues.  The models we bought last year showed significant burn-in from 5 minute video loops (after about 50 hours of pre-conditioning play of non-repeating video) in just a couple of weeks.  While video loops are way worse than any normal viewing, I do play games that will have a speedometer, etc. on the screen for hours, so  . . . LCD was the way for me.Coudn't be happier with the TV, my wife is wowed and my 6 year old said it was like we were sitting next to the helicopter pilot during a Discovery HD program.The price has fallen about $300 since I purchased the unit--so it's a real deal now.  I used Amazon for shipping and, other than it taking a few weeks to wind its way here (saved $$), it arrived on schedule, undamadged and was quickly unpacked and set in place by their delivery crew.  I had already run my cables and removed the old TV so in literally 5 minutes after they arrived (and I did a quick pixel check, etc.) they were on their way, along with the packing materials.I'm totally happy with this marvelous device so far, but two tiny things and these may be common to other units but they aren't things that show up on the showroom floor: switching video sources is fairly quick, but it takes a second or two to tune in the HDMI source (maybe it has to wind up signal processing?) and it takes about 5 seconds from when you turn the TV on until it actually comes on (I turned off the little chime that lets you know its doing something)--but I think the in-laws got confused and kept turning it on and off before it finished.", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Stunning!", "Author": "Worldfalls", "ReviewID": "R29HC5PQLZXYKG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV via Amazon a week or so ago and the purchase was made through Electronics Expo.  All dealings with the purchase and delivery went smoothly.I was originally planning to purchase the 46\", but believe me, these TV's look smaller in the stores than they will in your home.  I'm wholeheartedly happy with the size of this TV and glad I made the choice to buy the 40\".You wouldn't believe the picture on this TV.  It's just as beautiful as it looks in the stores.If you're not a huge sports fan, watching football on this TV will convert you!  Any kind of sports are unbelievable because the TV's picture is so striking.I agree with the last reviewer that the lacquer finish is disappointing, not necessarily because of the bling-bling effect (I do live in Atlanta after all ;)), but because it dulls the blacks that the TV produces a bit.  Strangely enough, I never noticed that while I was researching which TV to purchase.Some reviewers have mentioned that this TV makes a clicking noise when it's searching for sources.  Mine does in fact do that, but it only lasts for a couple of seconds where two or three clicks will occur.  This does not bother me at all, because honestly, I can only hear it if the rest of the house is quiet and the TV volume is turned very low.  I wouldn't let that stop you from making a purchase.As with any other expensive TV, I'd recommend purchasing the right cables for the best picture quality and also investing in an up-convert DVD player if you're avoiding the Blu-Ray/HD-DVD debacle as I am.  That way you can enjoy your new TV and movies until the prices on the true HD DVD players come down.Bottom line:  I recommend this TV 100% if you're looking to purchase an LCD TV rather than a plasma as I was.  The TV interface is also very sleek and user-friendly.  A great option for you if you're in the market for a 1080p LCD TV!", "Date": "October 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Top of the line LCD panel", "Author": "C. Chang \"book worm\"", "ReviewID": "R3AG4ZB5YRUNQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is equipped with a powerful LCD panel that allows you to exploit the full potential of a HD-DVD player. As a video professional I worked with different LCD monitors over the years. Both my wife and I are very happy with the purchase. The picture quality on this TV when it is displaying a HD-DVD movie in 1080p is unbelievable. Although I've seen 1080p movies almost everyday for work, I am still blown away and has become absessive to this TV like a kid.I've read a lot of HDTV reviews on amazon and I do not agree with some of the opinions. Here's my thoughts:1. 1080p vs 720p. If you're buying a TV greater than 37, get a 1080p. The next generation DVDs compression standards are optimized for 1080p. Bear in mind that 1920x1080 has 2.5 times the pixels of a 1280x720 TV, which makes a big difference on a big screen.2. Many people seem to be confusing video compression quality with a TV's quality. Most of the artifacts we saw on standard definition TV (blocking, ringing, contouring, etc.) comes from the fact that the video signal is heavily compressed. A good monitor will let you see a lot more details than an inferior monitor and as a result, the compression artifact will be more visible. Therefore, it doesn't make a lot of sense to make a purchase decision by just looking at TVs in-store side-by-side. A worse visual quality does not necessarily mean a worse TV.3. Another factor one should consider is that each TV comes with a lot of tuning options. The Circuit City guy told me they use the out-of-box setting for each TV. Since TVs from different manufacturers have different presets, you're bound to see different qualities. Comparing TV A and B, you may think you like the skin tones better on the more expensive TV A. However, maybe all you need is tune the color on B a little and you may find they look almost the same.That said, I think a fair way to compare TVs is to have them hooked up to HD-DVD or BlueRay players -- these are the devices that can give you the best video quality nowadays, tune each monitor to make sure that you can't do any better, and then compare them. This may be difficult to do in many stores. So do your research before you go to a store. For those who consider standard definition quality important, do not forget that you can tune your TV. With a good TV, you can always lower the settings (brightness, constrast ratio, etc) to hide video compression artifacts.On this particular TV, the Samsung 4095D comes with \"Dynamic\", \"Standard\", \"Movie\", \"Custom\" settings. Personally I think \"Dynamic\" gives you the sharpest picture, but i wouldn't recommend it for HD TV broadcasting that is in 720p or 1080i. You will be able to see color smears and blockings caused by video compression. \"Movie\" has lower contrast ratio but it does a real good job in imitating film's look and feel and hiding compression artifacts, which is what I use when watch HD movie channels. Plus it's easy on the eyes when watching TV at night.When I hooked up the TV with an xbox 360 with HD-DVD drive and put in \"Serenity\", the picture is absolutely flawless. You can use \"Dynamic\" setting with HD-DVD movies and you will not be able to see any artifacts no matter how close you're to the TV. That's the beauty of 1080p TV and HD-DVD.", "Date": "December 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice TV, but lacks QAM tuner", "Author": "F. Danna", "ReviewID": "R1J31DYTXJMOXM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm mostly happy with my purchase but I was disappointed to discover that the built in cable tuner is not capable of decoding QAM signals. The TV's display of analog signals is not any better than a standard TV, nor would I expect it to be.Without a QAM tuner, you will not be able to plug in your cable wire to the tv and expect any digital channels. You will be forced to rent the cable box (or buy it) from the cable provider and pay extra (usually) for the HD channels. Just when I thought I understood all the tecno-jargon that is dizzying with HDTVs, I missed this one crucial detail.So if you're trying to avoid the extra cable costs here's a breakdown:ATSC Tuner: Over the air digital TV, capable of transmiting HDTV broadcasts, FREE and available in most markets. This TV does have this tuner. In the Boston area there are about 13 stations you can get for free with a decent UHF antenna.Analog Cable Tuner: The basic cable spectrum that you can watch on any TV without a cable box and with standard quality (i.e. not so great), NO HD or DIGITAL. This TV has this tuner built in.Digital Cable Tuner (also called Clear QAM): The free, *required* by LAW signal that the cable company sends down the same cable wire, unscrambled. The channels are digital, HD capable, and do not require a set top box. THIS TV DOES NOT HAVE THIS TUNER.If you plan on getting the HD cable box from your cable company, then none of what I've said above is of any importance to you. You'll still get your full HD experience. The box will be required for premium channels (HBO, Showtime, etc) and Pay-per-view.So yes, it's a fantastic TV, it's just missing one little piece (for me). I'm a little surprised since cheaper HDTVs have this tuner built in. My only other gripe so far is that the remote control it comes with is a little sluggish on the uptake. It takes a while to change channels and I find that the signal often doesn't get picked up by the TV. Maybe the batteries I got were weak.", "Date": "December 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Near Perfect", "Author": "Klingon", "ReviewID": "R3SVFPE2QJ6DAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before choosing the Samsung LN-S4095, I did tons of research and viewing in the stores.  It came down between the Samsung and the Sony KDL-40XBR2 and the Panasonic TH-42PX600U.  I eliminated the Panasonic because I didn't want to deal with an extended \"break-in\" period of a couple hundred hours and the possibility of burn-in later.  The picture of the Sony appeared a little sharper and a little pushed to the red, both I believe to be artifacts of artificial edge enhancement and color preference on Sony's part.  The Samsung's picture seemed more natural and true to life to my eye.  Further, a big plus is that the SD channels look very good on the Samsung compared to just barely average on the Sony and until HD becomes universal, SD will be an annoying fact of life.  Personal preference:  I very much favor the piano-black finish of the Samsung and the thin screen surround compared to the glitzy glass edging of the Sony.  Then there's the unmistakable price advantage also.  Thus far, the Samsung has been everything I expected.  The only \"negative\" is average-sounding TV speakers.  BTW, the 4095 is almost identical to the 4096.", "Date": "February 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wonderful 1080p TV", "Author": "T. Malone", "ReviewID": "R9PRLN4D7GQ7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These reviews were a big help to me when I was researching my purchase, so I wanted to join the chorus of praise for the 4095.  I've had my set for two weeks now, and am delighted with it - I firmly believe the 4095 offers the best value for a high-quality 1080p LCD.  The picture quality is amazing with a good source - I've never been much of a nature show fan, but now I find myself an avid fan of the Discovery Channel and its incredible nature specials.  I'm watching basketball for the first time in years, transfixed by the rich colors and dazzling details.  Yet I was also surprised by how good standard-definition television looks on this set.  Well-produced SD shows such as Survivor look great - just as good if not better than on my previous three-year-old Philips SDTV.  And for those of you who have delved deep into the world of HD-forum research: no signs at all of \"cloudiness\" or any of the other picture problems found on some LCDs.  Also, the difference between the 4095 and the 4096 is essentially the ability to use a cable card.  I use a HD DVR box from the cable company, so this feature would have been useless to me; if you plan to do the same, save the couple hundred bucks and get the 4095 - you won't be missing out on anything.As others have mentioned, the only \"con\" would be the sound quality.  The lack of visible speakers make the display look sleek, modern, and classy in its \"piano black\" frame; but the sound suffers for it - hollow and at times tinny.  Of course, a TV of this quality deserves a good surround sound system, so I've already begun researching my next big purchase!  In sum, I HIGHLY recommend the Samsung 4095 - beautiful design, amazing picture, and a far better value than comparable sets.", "Date": "February 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Truly Awesome Machine", "Author": "Prince of Carthage \"Prince of Carthage\"", "ReviewID": "RYBUN1PN1K7HL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this TV yesterday and so far so VERY GOOD!

I purchased the Samsung LN-S4095D 40\" 1080p LCD HDTV during the holiday season for 100.00 less than today's price with the free supersaver shipping.

I did my research prior to purchasing and went to the local cable provider (Comcast) in preparation for the arrival of the new set. I upgraded to digital cable, released the High Definition (HD) signal (9.95 per month for the HD signal and Digital Video Recorder)(DVR/Cable Box). I have signal!UPGRADES. I went to the local Best Buy and struggled with the purchase of two High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) cables (99.00 each). I also upgraded my DVD player to a Samsung DVD/R-135 Recorder with HDMI connections. Now all we need is the LCD HDTV! Obviously, the connections via HDMI were a breeze. The Samsung has two HDMI ports. Connect one end of the LCD HDTV HDMI connection and the other end to the DVR/Cable box, and the same for the DVD player. I also attached a Monster Power surge protector that protects the inline cable connection from the wall to the Monster surge protector and then to the DVR/Cable box to receive the signal. All Monster cable connectors are 24 KT gold plated, hence the cost.PICTURE. The Samsung LN-S4095D displays an amazing picture under HD broadcast! The Late Show with David Letterman is amazing! Sporting events, your favorite shows, anything broadcast in HD is absolutely great.LESSONS LEARNED. HDTV requires many moving parts to get the picture you are expecting. Digital cable is not HDTV. You must pay for your Cable Company or Satellite provider to release the signal to your house or use the old fashion antenna. I can't tell you about that route. The Samsung LN-S4095D has a built in up converter and will convert all incoming signals to the highest possible resolution to better your viewing experience. I agree with the black shading comments. However, you will notice this on analog and digital signals and hardly ever notice with a true HD broadcast.  There are not many HD channels out there today! Yes, they are coming, but don't expect your favorite show to be in HD.In closing, I'm pleased with the Samsung LN-S4095D performance and price.", "Date": "February 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Samsung LNS4095D", "Author": "Janet Brown", "ReviewID": "R17BH8MM4D21TQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW...if I could only use one word for this hdtv this is it! We had this installed for us since it was going on the wall and was glad we did have it done by professional installers after we saw what all goes into doing it. I had shopped around for a couple of months to see the hdtv's in person and searched online for info and found the Samsung LCD hdtv's on display always looked great in any of the stores. In fact many of the stores were using Samsung hdtv's to display other devices. To me that there was already a hint they think the Samsung shows off the other devices like blu ray players and playstation3 the best.  This particular Samsung hdtv gives you alot of \"bang for the bucks\" when comparing other brands features.  We were glad we didn't go any smaller than the 40 inch for our living room set up and weren't too eager to pay $1,000 more for a 46 inch LCD Samsung just to get 6 more inches in size. Our antenna for the regular tv worked well picking up the local hd signals. We did go buy a new one since the old one was missing some tines and a wild tree has grown around it. Once we put in a new regular tv outdoor antenna we found a few more hd stations the old antenna didn't pick up. You don't need a hd antenna to get your local tv stations and the local hd stations, the regular antennas do pick them all up and look great. What amazed me is how much better our regular dvd movies look on this tv, it actually enhaunces them. I love the fact we can adjust the closed caption on the hd channels to the font style, font color, font size and background color that looks the best as I am nearly completly deaf and use CC all the time. For me the red font with black background is best and oddly for my husband he sees the green font with black background  best.  I found a Z-Line hdtv stand that matched this particular Samsung perfectly as its black glass and the same color metal in the legs. Even though the box says its for up to a 36 inch hdtv it fits perfectly with this Samsung as the stand is 43 inches wide. I had seen it at Circuit City with this very same Samsung sitting on it, thats how I knew it was perfect for it and a great price to boot! This way too if we ever wanted to move the hdtv off the wall and into another room we have this stand it can be placed on top of. Since the hdtv is on the wall now we are using it to hold our surround sound unit and speakers, dvd/vhs player and cassette player and looks like there is room for a ps3 to sit on top of one of the units.  Another hint, to get blu ray for your hdtv you'd be better off buying a ps3 than a blu ray player alone since you get a game player, blu ray player, cd music player, dvd movie player all in one with a ps3 cheaper!  I'm very happy with this hdtv!", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Amazing HDTV", "Author": "A. Artel", "ReviewID": "RQCDUVE23V6S4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from amazon, when the price was the lowest. It was not a quick decision though. I always do my research before buying a product. My budget was around $1500 and I wanted a 1080p lcd hdtv with preferably vga input for my pc. 40\" was the biggest size I could get for my place. Setting up the constraints was easy, but research took some time. First of all, there are new Sharp products with 1080p and screen size 32\" and 37\", however these are new and only 32\" fit the bill. It was around $1400-$1500 and 37\" was more expensive. By the way, they do not have vga input and this is the only way I can connect my pc, since it has vga output only and the tvs have dvi digital, so even an adapter with dvi male to vga female with a vga cable won't work, since the pins in dvi digital and dvi analog are different. However, this was again a minor issue and if I had been able to find a Sharp HDTV, I would have bought it because of budget considerations. I also checked 37\" 1080p from Westinghouse, which can be had for around $1000, but I also read bad things about its customer service and that Samsung 4095 has a better picture quality. Westinghouse is not HDTV by the way, it is a HD ready monitor without a tuner, so you have to have a box, you cannot watch HD channels with a regular antenna (which was not my case anyway, but I wanted to point this out). As you can see, I was not biased towards any product, as long as it fit the bill. I went to a best buy store to check the picture quality with my own eyes. They carried Sony xbr2 and Samsung 4095, and these were only products with 1080p at that time with a screen size less than or equal to 40\". Xbr2 was above my budget, but for the sake of picture quality comparison, I spent some time in front of each tv. First, let me tell you that xbr2, xbr3 from Sony and 4095 and 4096 from Samsung use the same panel produced in the factory of Samsung. Their video engine is different from one brand to another. Sony was connected to a Sony blu-ray, whereas Samsung was connected to a Samsung one. Probably bot screens were not calibrated for the best picture, but I could not pick something, which I did like more on xbr2 than 4095. Actually, I liked Samsung a bit more, but as I said, probably both tvs were not calibrated for the best picture. After this visit to best buy, I focused more on 4095/4096 series from Samsung. The main difference between 4095 and 4096 is that 4096 has a cable-card slot, but I did not need this and I also read that although the technology looks promising, a box from comcast gives more features than its cable-card counterpart. I already had a box from comcast (black motorola box is not HD, you should get a HD box from them, there is a monthly fee of $12 and an activation charge of $18 for this cable box, if you are using the service from comcast), so choosing 4095 over 4096 was no brainer considering a couple hundred dollar difference between them. I checked the new products, which will come to market this year as well, knowing that they will be above my budget. Samsung will have 65f and some 81 series, which will provide a better contrast ratio, offer more digital inputs and lacking vga one. I suggest if you do not have a limited budget, you better wait for those (considering also that the price of this HDTV has increased a lot in the past few days). They look very promising, especially 81, but the price will of course waaaay above.I ordered this tv from amazon on Wednesday 3/21 and got it on Thursday 3/29. The delivery date was between the interval of the delivery estimate, so it seems ok. However the tv was on the local eagle store on Friday 3/23 and they could not deliver before. I got a 4-hour window oin the delivery date, got a call from the driver around 30min before the delivery. There were 2 guys and they carried the tv with a cart, unpacked it and put it on the place I wanted. They waited until I was sure the set was working, then I signed the papers and they left. Overall, I am very satisfied with eagle's service, only complaint can be that it would have been better, if they could have delivered it earlier.Now about the picture quality: The PQ is great if the signal is HD. PS3 looks amazing, the HD cable box does also a very nice job. Blu-ray movies are great. The pc input works like a charm, I could get UXGA picture from the tv after I connected it. I like to have a bigger screen and using the pc with a wireless keyboard and I recommend you do so, if you buy the 4095. I changed the box after I got the tv, so I had the chance of checking standard definition channels as well. They look worse compared to my old 27\" Sony Wega SD tv. But the problem is also that this tv is bigger, so if you are watching it from the same distance, you will see a worse picture. Increase your viewing distance, you will be fine even with 480 lines. With 1080p, this is another story. You can be very close to the tv and stand almost next to it and you see amazing details and the picture is great. The blacks are very good, actually I cannot imagine a better picture comapared to the one I get after I calibrated it a bit. I have to see that better picture with my own eyes. I highly recommend it if you do have a HD source.As a last word for the cables: monoprice is a good site, which offers nice quality cables for cheap prices. I got my hdmi cable from them. The buld quality is very good. Do not pay a lot for hdmi cables. You will, if you buy them on store, regardless of brand. Some brands are more famous and more expensive, but you do not need that. The signal is digital and if you see something bad on your screen, which you can point out, then there is a problem with the cable, however if you cannot do that, this means that the picture is perfect and guess what, you do not need to have expensive cables for that. Cheap ones work well. I recommend getting thicker ones with increasing length of the cable and do not pay much :).I am not affiliated with any brands that I mentioned here, I just wanted to share my experience.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Happy with this Purchase!", "Author": "John Bales", "ReviewID": "R2G6Y0ASMCO5PO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I bought this TV locally, I wanted to review it for those that may consider ordering from Amazon.com. When I originally went into a local store to look at LCD TVs, I had't planned on purchasing a 40\" model, much less a 1080P. However, after seeing the Samsung LN-S4095D I was hooked by the wonderful picture quality in the store. I was originaly planning to purchase an LCD TV in two weeks when I get my annual profit sharing check. However, this model was on sale for $[...] less than normal so I ended up getting a local store card so I could take advantage of the sale and then can pay it off in the near future. I got the TV home, out of the box and hooked up. When I turned the set on, the picture quality was simply spectacular - right out of the box! When initially turned on, the TV asks a few simple questions about how you'll use the TV - whether antenna or cable, if you want the TV to automatically download the time, if you want the TV to automatically adjust for daylight savings time, and the viewing aspect you want to use. Then it sets up the TV and brings up the picture.  The first ones from the History Channel were stunning. As of yet, I haven't felt the need to adjust any settings other than to turn on the surround sound option. One thing I was suprised at was the owner's manual. It's huge (reminds me of the owners manuals I used to get with computer software in the early and mid '90s, only bigger).

The picture quality is amazing (pretty good before, but even better after some tuning) and it plays 1080p HD-DVDs from my X-box 360 beautifully, as well as the games that the 360 up converts to 1080p (we'll have native 1080p soon).  Standard TV looks fine as well, it does look a little strange sometimes, but I think most of it is just realizing how crummy regular TV is compared to HDTV.  Bought it for about 2k after everything from BB with a coupon.  Matches my Samsung TQ85 Home Theater system beautifully as well.  I had considered this one and the Sharps 1080p 42\" model, and sided with this eventually because I just thought the picture was better, and the Sharp lacks a VGA input, which is the only way that I can play HD-DVDs in 1080p from my X-Box.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the market.  The Sony XBRs, which are about 600-700$ more, DO have a SLIGHTLY superior image quality, but it just isn't worth the price.

Nelson \"and insignificant other\"", "ReviewID": "R3MH0QWEAKOX2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a significant amount of shopping around for an LCD TV b/c it seemed like the better way to go for us.  We have a bright living room and want to use the unit for computer presentations as well as normal stuff that you'd normally use a TV for.  After reviewing all the major on-line retailer review sites, Consumer Reports, etc., we narrowed the choice down to either this unit or the larger Samsung LN-S4692.  Honestly, neither my wife nor I could really tell the difference between the 1080i and 1080p signal, and probably won't be able to on a 40\" unit, but when it came down to it, we realized that the 46\" model was just going to be too big for the space.  Our viewing area is between 9 and 10 ft from the unit, and my wife did not want to contend with having to move her head from side to side to see everything on the screen.  Since we had settled on a price point approaching $2k, we just downsized the model (LN-S4692) and went the next step up in terms of \"quality\" although honestly the 4692 is a fantastic set in its own right.  Amazon had the unit for $1768 with free shipping (it came in four days via Eagle, and that was a completely pleasurable experience in its own right).OK, the impressions - the picture quality is incredible.  Light levels, color levels, etc. are really really configurable.  Connectivity is everything one could hope for, from two HDMI inputs to DVI to all sorts of everything else, including a PC (VGA) input.  The native sound from the unit is adequate, but just that.  I wouldn't think of relying on TV speakers after dropping 2K on it, though.  Strange, isn't it?  Did I mention the picture quality is incredible?  I am wishing for something that I can see in 1080p resolution.  My DVD player, which upconverts to 1080i, makes me into a couch potato.  I sat through almost the entire Lord of the Rings, enthralled at watching how much detail you can make out in Gollum's face, hair, etc.  The standard definition signal through digital cable is even fine!  Sometimes, it borders on really good, in fact.  At worst, it is equivalent to my old standard definition set.  This was a real question mark in my wife and my eyes, so seeing how good normal broadcast looks on this unit is just icing on the cake.  At some point I may be convinced to go HDTV, but I almost don't even want it, I'm so impressed with the regular broadcast over digital cable.So... I completely recommend this unit.  If you are a couch potato (I am not), you will need something like this to ratchet up your viewing experience.  If you are an occasional or movie-only viewer, you are in for a treat.  Good-bye theaters.  The fact that I have absolutely no buyer's remorse after plunking that kind of coin down on a pure luxury item speaks volumes.

For standard definition viewing it is only average as the image gets a bit blurred due to stretching of normal 4:3 content and the well known poor scaling issues with most LCDs. When it comes to high definition content then you are in for some great eye candy. The main possible issue for most with this set is with the contrast. I thought that a contrast of 6000:1 would be more than sufficient but I still need to have a dim light in the back of the TV to get some artificial contrast enhancement. What this means is that if you are watching the TV in a very dark room, some dark scenes in movies may not be as clear as they should be because the TV cannot produce deep blacks. Therefore, any shade of gray to black may be a bit lost producing a washed image in some \"dark scenes.\" Remember, this issue only applies if you are going to watch movies in a totally dark room. With the lights on in your room you won't have these issues. As a result, calibration of this set is very difficult. Some of the adjustments are not very responsive (possibly due to contrast limitations). This contrast issue will be more apparent with dark movies such as The Da Vinci code and Star Wars. The response time is a bit slow from white to black. Overall, the TV was a great purchase for me since I plan to do a lot of computer gaming with it but if you are looking to watch more movie or sports content than simply playing games, then I would recommend that you go with a plasma TV with a contrast ratio of no less than 10,000:1. However, having the extra resolution at an \"affordable\" price was also a factor in my decision to buy this TV (1080p resolution in this set = full high definition support  = full HD-DVD and Blu-ray goodness). Most affordable plasmas only support 720p and 1080i high definition content, which is still great. However, with the Samsung LN-S4095D you get the full spectrum of resolutions including 1080p which is the highest you can get today without getting a second mortgage. Your eyes CAN tell the difference.", "Date": "December 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great TV, But Are You Sure of HD Right Now?", "Author": "Rob Galbreath \"In The Name of Harman\"", "ReviewID": "R3OAR358WR861I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Television.  Beautiful.  All the reviews above and below will say the same thing.  Connect it to a 5.1 or 7.1 audio system and you're good to go.  Honestly, the speakers aren't as bad as everybody claims they are.  Not perfect, but no different than most standard televisions.  I listen to standard cable channels with the speakers and I don't have any problems at all.I'm a video gamer.  Many of you might know my name from a few gaming journalism sites/magazines.  Here's the breakdown of how gamers will react.Xbox 360/PS3:  Absolutely beautiful.  Until you sit down in your own living room watching this crystal-clear beauty called high definition, you won't know what you're missing.  After playing several high-definition games, this is hands-down a great purchase.  If you don't own a Xbox 360, the Xbox 360 Elite (release end of April 07) will make a lot more sense for this TV -- you want the newly-added HDMI on the 360 Elite for a better picture.  With HDMI, your audio and video signal run straight to your television and you can output an optical signal in true dolby beauty for cable channels and gaming.Wii/Regular Cable: Honestly, you're going to be disappointed when it comes to 480 (interlace or progressive, doesn't matter) television.  The television itself has nothing to do with this: it's the signal.  This television is advanced and worth it in the long-term set of things, so its native resolution is 1080p and it's trying to display a picture of old technology in half the size.  Old TV still looks like old TV no matter how you spin it, and Wii looks like any old $300 television you can buy with the money.  If you're buying it solely for these two purposes, don't bother.There's only a few reasons to own a television of this caliber right now:- Already subscribed to high-definition broadcasts, not basic cable.- Already own or plan to own an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.- Plan to fork over $500-$1000 for a high-definition player right now.This review was written on March 31, 2007.  As of right now, the new high definition format still hasn't been determined.  Blu-ray, HD DVD, IPTV... Nobody really knows what's going to win out and it's dumb to spend a grand on something that may not be successful at all.  The war is expected to last until 2008, so don't spend too much money.It's important to also note that this television does not have a CableCARD slot like the 4096 version (same TV, one model up).  Instead, this one has an old S-Video input that the 4096 doesn't have.  S-Video is a bit clearer than the yellow-white-red composite cables, but nothing truly significant.  If you're buying high-definition channels, make sure that you are aware of this lacking CableCARD feature.  Not too many people are affected by it yet (and hopefully never will be), but it might prove problematic for cable users if you're buying this for a television experience and not a disc/gaming experience.High-definition gamers will rejoice.  The top button on the right-hand side of the television is the source button to switch gaming consoles -- no need to find the remote.  In addition, every channel has its own widescreen or standard settings.  Playing your old Super Nintendo on one source input will maintain its size with bars vertically on the left and right while your next-generation console inputs will stay in their widescreen format.Overall, it's a great purchase if one of those three conditions above apply to you.  If you think you're jumping the gun on high-definition, you probably are.  The format war isn't over and a lot of people are still waiting on next-generation buys.

This was great on the HD, but horrid on the non-HD (these settings are accessed with the cable box off and by pressing the Options button on the cable box).  So, I cycled through the non-HD options and tested each setting.  I stopped on the 480i setting for the non-HD channels...this was much better than any other setting and much better than any output setting on the Toshiba.Also, I am using the Component cables rather than HDMI.

The Sony's that I saw did outperform the Samsung's, but at nearly $500 more, they were not worth it.As far as the TV goes, the HD picture quality is amazing and the SD picture quality is really good.  I was a bit worried when I read some reviews saying SD picture quality was horrible.  However, when running SD through S-Video or better (such as HDMI, or Component) the picture is better than that of your average SD-TV.  If you run your SD through Coax then the picture is pretty bad as would be expected.  The sound quality of this TV is not very good.

Our TV is in a room with lots of windows and the picture stood up well to the extra light.There is a 5 second delay in turning on the set.

After a while, you won't notice it.I think the TV design is solid and the black gloss finish looks great.  The swivel is quite handy to adjust the screen.A small gripe is the sound output.  The sound quality of the TV speakers is not good.  You should plan to route the sound signal to a Home Theater system.  There are 2 HDMI inputs, so the TV can accept a Dolby Digital 5.1 signal.  The TV however, converts the audio signal, from the optical output, to PCM 2.1 (2 channel).  I had to bypass the TV altogether for the sound.  I have the cable box and DVD audio connected directly to my Home Theater system via 2 optical cables.  Dolby digital audio makes the hi-def experience much more immersive.But the sad thing is...I wish I could keep the HDTV, but after seeing the high def picture, I want a larger screen!

Now that there are new models from Samsung on the market, this TV can be had for a good price, if you can still get your hands on one.The main difference between the 4x95 and 4x96 series is the addition of IEEE 1394 and Cablecard support (internal QAM tuner) on the 4x96 series. Since I don't need either, the 4095 was the right choice for me.I have no complaints about the TV. It is a quantum leap over the 10 year old 32\" 4:3 NTSC TV that it replaced.The user interface is well thought out and easy to use.Black levels are pretty good too. The new 4x65 series are supposed to do a better job with blacks, but the tradeoff is that they have shiny screens (similar to those Trubrite screens on many notebooks) that tend to reflect a lot (unlike the 4x9x).I bought a Samsung 1080p7 upconverting DVD player from Amazon.com to go with this - this does a great job with upconversion on DVDs (to 1080p) running via HDMI. Samsung DVD-1080P7 Up-Converting 1080p DVD Player.

There is a firmware update from Microsoft to get Xbox 360 to output at 1080p (Nov 2006 update - you can get it by signing on to Xbox live). Xbox 360 never looked better & my kids have been having a lot of fun playing on it.The TV also supports PC input via VGA.

I was worried about non-HD channels, but those are fine, and better than my old TV.--Audio is better than expected, given how little it adds to the footprint of the TV. Perhaps a little tinny. I'm going to run it through an audio system anyway.--Plenty of inputs. I wanted a VGA input for computer and few LCDs come with them.Cons:--Black bezel is distracting. No reflection off screen, but the bezel reflects plenty of light. I don't understand the appeal of the glossy bezel.--My old Toshiba had 3 different ways of zooming input that wasn't 16:9 and it would not only automatically remember what you selected, but would pick right size for HD input.

Firstly, as others have said, the speakers are weak.  But if you're in the mood to spend nearly $2k on a TV, you can hopefully afford at the very least, a HTiB.  I have the TV hooked into my Pioneer receiver via TOSlink (since my rec. doesn't support HDMI) and it's amazing.  Secondly, the 'zoom/crop' features aren't as plentiful.  There are a few options, but they're never exactly what I want.  And lastly, it only has two HDMI inputs.  They're already used up now by my HTPC and STB, so I'll have to use either component cables or get an HDMI switch box, neither being a very ideal option.

I've had this tv for a month now and it is very good and has a nice picture and good features. However after watching it for awhile I have come to the conclusion that Plasma offers a better picture overall - more depth and better coloring. LCD is probably a little more \"clear\". I'm just not as impressed as I expected to be with this tv. I don't like the remote very much either. You have to menu thru on-screen to change some features whereas on my previous Mitsubishi I could just push one button on the remote (such as PIP). HDMI is also a pain to deal with (not so much this tv, but the way HDMI works in general). For instance, I tried to run my Comcast Motorola box HDMI thru my A/C Receiver and the Moto won't allow it (I get a Protected Repeaters error) this is due to the cable box firmware that needs updated. Also, you sometimes have to have one device on before turning on the other as some devices turn off the HDMI port if they don't see anything connected to it. AND the way they incorporated the sound on HDMI it can become unsynced with the video. I think HDMI benefits copyright protection more than it does viewership. And one other thing that will screw up everything is they have a new HDMI 1.3 spec coming out very shortly that I fear will make all existing HDMI components obsolete with newer equipment staring early next year. So here shortly their supposed to come out with HD-DVD at 1080p but we probably won't be able to connect it to this tv due to the HDMI imcompatibility.

I'm giving this 3 stars not because the TV is mediocre, but because it arrived at my home broken.  The Eagle delivery man arrived when promised, but right away both he and I could tell the TV had been on a very rough journey.  The corners were crunched.  One side of the cardboard had a long gash in it.  Just based on that, he recommended I refuse this delivery.  We took it inside and unpacked it.  It actually looked fine superficially, but when I plugged it in, it was clear the back of the panel was shattered.  I refused delivery and the man (who by the way was very friendly and helpful) packed the TV and took it away.  I called Amazon to see what I needed to do and they said the refund would be processed as soon as the TV came back to them.

Have been very pleased with it.  Bought it from Amazon along with a Sony upconvert DVD/CD player (DVP-NS75H)that Amazon had on sale.  What a great combination. The DVD player plays all my DVD's no matter the source and image is excellent. Should note the DVD player is single DVD player not multiple which I like much better than the other SONY I have which is multi disk.  Loads faster and is less confusing to other members of the family to operate.  Enough said on DVD player but if you're in market suggest you give this one your consideration.Have the TV hooked up to a Comcast Digital cable box and when operated on HD channel such as Discovery the picture is nothing less than spectacular.  Think it maxes out at 1080i even though the TV can go to 1080p.  Hard to believe picture can get any better but at least I am ready for highest level of HD when available.  Frankly it will be a long time before I go to blue ray as I can't see that it is worth the current high cost. I find it hard to believe it would be that much better than what I can see now.  The picture is really that good. Even the std digital channels on cable are very very good.Initially I was very disappointed with the standard definition on this TV.  My reaction was as others have reported that something this expensive should at least display the broadcast channels as well as my old TV.  Should mention I also have a std SONY CRT TV which is couple years old and is High Definition but connected to different cable outlet in my home.  This older SONY had much better standard def picture so did some research.  Tracing coax back to the input point into the house I realized the SONY had a direct connection from back of TV to house input point.  The Samsung connection had enough splitters, connectors and multiple TV's on it that the signal was weak.  Bought an amp for it ($25 at Home Depot) which I connected at the input source (easier than running coax to just the Samsung) and what a difference.  Picture thousand percent better.  Almost like high def and easily as good as the aforementioned SONY.  If you are having standard definition quality problems this is likely your solution.  Run cable without all the splitters on it or buy the amplifier.As for Amazon service they were great.  Received TV in couple weeks.  Delivery was on time and they unpacked it and put it where requested.  Amazon dropped price on this TV the day after I rec'd it and when I sent them email they gave me the lower price. Nice savings and good way to keep my business.  Thanks Amazon!Some additional minor comments: 1) no dead pixels found which is always the worry on LCD, 2)Glossy bezel issue others report not problem for me but this is all personal taste, 3) buy cables from Amazon suppliers as they work great and are much more reasonable since I think the Monster cables are big rip off, 4)TV is very easy to setup and 5) comments on audio from others are correct in that its OK from TV but you should hook up a quality audio system to this to get full benefit.In summary I strongly recommend this TV.", "Date": "March 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Best 40\" LCD on the Market  for Price and PQ", "Author": "P.

I have 2 (cheap) HDMI cables on order from Amazon and will see if there is a difference in PQ. Even if not I much prefer 2 cables hooked to the back of the TV instead of 10.The Universal remote that comes with the HD satellite receiver is fantastic.

When I got it home, I was thrilled with the bright, vivid picture and the matte finish cabinet.  Unfortunately, what couldn't be discerned from the documentation was whether it supports 1080p over component.  It doesn't and was returned as a result.The Samsung has been a pleasant surprise.  I would say that while not identical to the Sony, the Samsung's picture quality is just as good and is excellent on HD content.  The Samsung accepts 1080p over component from my XB360 and HD-DVD's look great on this set right out of the box.  A little tweaking with my old Avia disc and the picture is even better.One weakness I would say is the sound quality which lacks volume, sounds somewhat muffled and has no bass response at all.  Luckily I wasn't expecting much in this department and the Sony wasn't really any better.  I like that the speakers are down-firing and not visible though.Another weakness is probably the remote which seems pretty basic for a nearly $2K TV.  This TV sports a \"game\" mode which supposedly enhances performance for video games, but enabling this function requires going through the TV's menu system rather than having a dedicated button on the remote for it.  Kind of tedious and I think this was an oversight on Samsung's part.Amazon processed and shipped fast and the TV arrived undamaged, so no complaints there either.

We took the settings from the 'Movie' setting as a basis for our own 'Custom' setting and are pleased with the results.There are a few things that people should be aware of though.  If you don't have a stereo, this TV might not be for you.  The sound coming from the bottom speakers is pretty shoddy.  If the volume is turned up for watching a DVD, it can sound very tinny.Another thing that seems missing is there is no anamorphic screen stretching mode for watching regular TV.  While some people don't like this feature, I prefer it to having window box bars on the sides.  Granted, it's not a big deal, and I've gotten used to it, but it was a nice feature on our previous TV.  There IS a wide zoom mode, but unless the show is in letterbox format, it will take off a bit of the top and bottom in exchange for showing things using the entire screen.These flaws are minor, but considering the price and the connectivity options, they hardly detract from the overall package.  If you're looking for a 40 inch 1080p TV for around 1500, this is about as good as you can go.  And speaking of 1080p, Blu-Ray movies look fantastic in that resolution.

I paid almost half for this Samsung and enjoy it almost as much.The biggest complaint I have is that it takes forever to turn on! Literally about 10 seconds...very odd.

Fuchs \"jax76\"", "ReviewID": "R1EO30DJTGVLYR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've now had both the 42\" Sharp 4206DU and a Samsung 40\" S4095D (both 1080p) for nearly a year and I definitely prefer the Sharp. I'm not a total techno-geek nor someone who has to have the biggest, most awesome home theater setup so this review is for your average couch potato who is, nevertheless, able to hear and see small differences in television video and audio quality.First of all, let me say that the difference between high definition and standard definition television viewing is huge. With a high definition broadcast and television, you can see details that are simply amazing. I find myself watching cake decorating challenges on food network's high def channel just to look at the light shining off tiny little drops of sugar sculpture or frosting. Watching a poker tournament is a whole different experience -- you can see every pore on a player's nose and every bead of sweat on his forehead. My mother's first comment on seeing a broadcast in high definition on the Sharp was that she would never want to be filmed in high definition. You can see every wrinkle.On the down side, high-definition set standard broadcasts look worse than they do on a CRT, although not by much. You can see the difference, by switching between a network news program's high and standard definition broadcasts. The difference is staggering. If, however, you're not going to get a high-definition signal right away or play games on a current game module or watch a lot of DVDs on a high definition DVD player, then there is no sense spending your money now on a high definition television. If you know you want a high-definition set, then the question is which one to buy. Of all the sets that I looked at (and I checked out a LOT of them), in the 37-42\" range, the Sharp was the best buy. The Sony XBrite was the best looking set, no question, but not worth the substantially higher price one would have to pay for it. If money is really no object, by all means go for the Sony. Otherwise, the Sharp is the one I'd choose.The Sharp was the first high def t.v. I got and then when I wanted a second television I got the Samsung. Watching these sets with a DISH network satellite signal and a good, but non-high def DVD player, here's why I like the Sharp better:SIZE:I initially had the Sharp in a small bedroom, about 8 1/2 feet from where it would be viewed. Quite honestly, a 46 inch or even 50 inch picture would have looked better from that distance. However, as a piece of furniture, a 42 inch television was too big for the room. A 2 inch difference may not seem like a lot, but it does make a difference both in terms of viewing quality and at how much space it takes up in the room. If you don't want your television to overwhelm a small space go with a slightly smaller set. Otherwise, get the biggest set you can afford that has a picture that really isn't too big for the viewing distance. There are lots of online calculators to help you figure out the best size for your viewing distance. Keep in mind that a high-definition picture is less stressful to look at and should be bigger than a standard set at the same distance. In addition a standard broadcast is not going to take up the entire screen (assuming you don't stretch the picture to fit the screen, although personally I think stretching makes things look strange).ATTRACTIVENESS:Both the sharp and the Samsung are beautiful models. The sharp has a wavy curve to the bottom that some people will no doubt find appealing. To me, however, the curve at the bottom is distracting as it tends to pull the eye down. It took me a long time to learn to ignore it. Other than that the sharp is the more attractive unit. The Samsung has one serious downside in that it has a bright blue light that glows when it is off. Unfortunately the Samsung is the unit that I have in my bedroom and I have to cover the light with a DVD box when I go to sleep otherwise I find the light interferes with sleeping. If I were buying a second set again, I would probably get another Sharp. Even though it looks a little big in the room the extra size is helpful if your viewing distance is more than 7 feet, plus it doesn't glow in the dark.PICTURE QUALITY:Both sets have good picture quality although both take a serious amount of adjusting from the factory settings. Oddly, the Samsung requires that contrast be set almost to the maximum. It took me a very long time to get both sets adjusted. Different settings are required to get the maximum best viewing a high-definition broadcasts, standard definition broadcasts and ancillary input. The sharp, in particular, lets you save different settings for each one and you can toggle between them. I went to the online AVS Forum and looked up discussion threads for each of my televisions to see what settings other people found were optimal and used used the most common ones as my starting point, which made it much easier to adjust both televisions. In general, the Sharp is, well, sharper, although the flesh tones tend to be washed out. Colors are brighter and warmer on the Samsung, which also has better skin tones. Picture quality is definitely best on each with an HDMI cable, however, do not spend more than $30 on one. The picture quality won't be any different. I know this, I learned the hard way. If you want to know why a cheap cable works as well as a monster cable, there are plenty of online explanations and I can verify this from personal experience as well. I started watching DVDs from a standard player with an S-video cable and the picture and sound were garbage. Component cables (blue, green, red) took care of the problem and the picture quality is comparable to a high-definition broadcast.SOUND QUALITY:If you're going to hook up your television to a stereo system ignore this section. I don't have room or the outlets to add home theater sound to my television, so I just use the speakers in the television itself. Neither set has particularly impressive sound, although the sound on the sharp is acceptable. The sound on the Samsung is really tinny and on some programs makes dialogue very difficult to understand as the difference in the frequency between dialogue and background is not what it should be. I'm not someone who cares that much about the sound on my television so I ingored other people's bad reviews on sound for the Samsung. Big mistake. If you're planning on using the television as is without hooking it up to a stereo then you should not get the Samsung. I've kind of gotten used to the sound, but I still have to hit rewind on my DVR far too frequently because of missed dialogue.REMOTE, RESPONSIVENESS, COMPATIBILITY:The sharp remote is really big and has a kind of strange pointy bulky bottom end. The Samsung remote is definitely a more user friendly size, but doesn't work as well as the sharp one. The Samsung remote must be pointed directly at the television and it doesn't work too well from a distance. Both remotes are fairly easy to use once you learn them. Both televisions are completely compatible with dish network remotes, although I find I need to have the television remotes around for picture adjustments when switching between inputs. Screen menus are fine on both sets once you get used to them. The real problem with the Samsung is that the response time from pressing anything on the remote is really long. It takes a long time for the television to come on and it takes a frustratingly long time to switch between inputs. The sharp does not have this problem.VALUE:Both sets cost about the same amount of money and I'd say both are pretty good buys compared to other televisions on the market. If you don't play on a 1080p console and don't think you're going to keep this television for more than a few years you can buy a less expensive 1080i television instead of spending the extra money for 1080p since right now the best signal you can receive is 1080i. Otherwise, since the broadcasters have a mandate to improve their signals to 1080p within the next few years you do well with either of these sets. There are other reviews on here that explain some of the input limitations on these sets, so I won't repeat them here. For viewing with a satellite or cable receiver with an attached DVD and VCR, the inputs on both sets are fine. You can't go wrong with either of these television sets, however, given the larger picture, better sound and slightly better picture, the Sharp is a better value than the Samsung.

The same happens within 2 minutes of turning on or unplugging and plugging in the TV.  I called Samsung and they immediately said it sounds like the lamp is going bad.  According to Samsung, this is a very common problem with all LCD and Plasma TVs and it is not surprising to happen in less than a year from purchase.  The rep said that it is the reason they have a 15 month warranty.  They have set up a repair technician, but since they work with ONLY ONE company in all of Houston, it will take 5 days to get out to our house.  Then they will have to order the part (another week, if in stock, per customer service) and then they will have to set another time to install the new lamp.  She said we should expect to be without a TV for a couple of weeks or so.  I think that is astounding given the fact that they know this is an issue.  Why would you only have one service company under contract in a city the size of Houston and why wouldn't they have lamps available if it is a known issue with this typt of TV.  This is a big disappointment since we have really liked this TV and have recommended it to others.  I hope they can work out this issue", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "one of the first solid and reasonably priced true 1080p HDTVs", "Author": "LILass", "ReviewID": "R2N7S9VLSZVL9M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this in May 2007 for 1700 delivered. At the time it was the best and most reasonably priced 1080p HDTVs.Pros: price is better than any other brand offering the same features, picture quality even in non-hd is very good and quite configurable, fabulous HDTV picture, really easy to set up and learn to use all the neat features on the remote, beautiful looking unit, speaker placement at bottom keeps the unit width down so can fit a larger LCD in smaller spaces.Cons: the sound leveling option simply does not work which is very frustrating when every channel runs at a different volume. The speakers really are bad- they vibrate with high bass settings so must keep the bass down. You had better have a surround sound system if you get this tv. 8rms isn't really fast enough for me in 480i- noticeable artifacts. In HD the artifacts are barely noticeable and in game mode, which speeds up the rms but is only available for dvds and games, is much better and wish it was used full time for tv too. It doesn't have a seeing eye to automatically adjust picture brightness based on the room brightness so you have to adjust it yourself using the energy saver button on the remote which has 4 levels. I kinda wish I'd held out for a model that has a QAM tuner and cablecard slot so I'd have more options for HDTV because I really don't want a clunky set top box QAM tuner and yet another remote at all-how 1970s! I'd like to get a cable dvr stb, which would negate the need for a QAM tuner in the tv, however, they are currently so huge one wouldn't even fit on the cabinet shelf with my other components so I'm waiting 'till more sleek models become available. Lastly, the remote, however easy, has the buttons really poorly placed and the tactical design is horrible- can't use this one without actually looking at it-ever! I much prefer the buttons in the circle to be the main channel and volume buttons with the prev-channel and fav channels buttons just above it and the number pad directly above them. The least they could have done was make the volume and channel buttons true rockers- all the buttons feel the same. Who designs these things? Do they ever use them?This was my first Samsung electronic purchase (I'm a Panasonic-aholic) because in my opinion, no other HDTV LCDs compared in both quality and price to Samsung's. Well my main board started to fail 3 months after I got it- the picture started intermittently changing to vert. and horiz. lines of picture pixels and the rest black. But I called Samsung and they sent a great repairman to my home and he replaced the main board in 10 minutes. It was still under original warranty, but I'm also glad I got the extended warranty for this thing. Seems to me LCDs are far less reliable in the long run than the old CRTs. But the repairman said it was the first time he'd repaired this model, and that he owns Samsung LCDs himself and they are quite reliable tvs. It's fine now!Some pointers- I don't know why so many people like to put the color temperature on warm. I find that cool 1 and cool 2 are far more realistic. Anyway, there are 4 configurable picture modes that you can set any way you want and switch between them easily on the remote. The movie mode, however doesn't allow you to enable the DNL so keep the contrast high on that one. DNL overlays solid black pixels over the darkest areas of the screen to blacken the blacks more. I find it adds too much movement though, so rarely use it. The tv remembers which picture size you last used in each input-tv, vcr, dvd, aux etc. No it doesn't auto-size to fit. I wouldn't want it to do that anyway. I like the control. It offers all the usual options- 4:3 actual scale, zoom 1 which stretches 4:3 width to fit, zoom 2 which maintains aspect ratio and cuts off the top and bottom of 4:3 pictures to fill the screen, 16:9 for widescreen pictures. You manually name analog channels with their call letters in the channel manager and digital channel names feed in from the source. PIP only works with a 2nd external tuner through specific inputs and not from a vcr tuner on composite input. I played with the pc input but my laptop doesn't go to a high enough resolution and cannot zoom the pc picture enough so was a bit disappointed with the little floating picture on the screen. Will have to upgrade my laptop video card next!Update:After 2 years, the plastic framework inside the swivel pedestal broke. Unfortunately the company I purchased the extended warranty from dissapeared off the face of the earth, so I pulled it apart and glued it back together with crazy glue and re-inforced the honycomb interiors with mighty puddy. That stuff is really amazing. That pedestal is in better shape now than it was as designed! But that was a project!Also I got a HTPC (home theater PC) and connected it via HDMI and SDIF to this TV and was getting overscan on picture (overhangs edges all around so can't get to start menu etc.), and the stupid NVidia video card drivers are all buggy in the rezize picture area. Newer TVs have a setting to remove overscan from PCs and this one didn't. So checked the Samsung support site and sure enough a firmware update was available for this model and we installed it and now it has a \"Just Scan\" option as one of the picture sizes that removes the overscan for the HTPC picture- beauty!I use a passive very inexpensive HDMI switch to input 3 different video sources of HD video into one HDMI input. It's just easier that way because the switch automatically switches sources based on what is on and you can pick a video source directly rather than toggling through the sources on the TV. I find the picture sometimes gets a colored line matix over it when I first turn on the TV. I think it is a little sensitive to the switch but if I turn it off, wait a half-minute and then back on, it fixes itself. Also, when playing some blu-rays from the HTPC I do need to plug the power adapter in for the HDMI switch to give the signal more oomph, otherwise the picture gets these white flashes in it continually. HDMI can do that if the signal is not strong enough. Fortunately this switch can be used active or passive.I also learned that if you feed 5.1 surround audio into this TV through HDMI with the video, it causes the source component to downscale the digital audio to stereo even when you are sending the audio to the receiver through the optical out on the components. So, if you have a receiver, set your components to only send video through the HDMI and no audio over HDMI.", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "A. D.

I have been 110% happy with it. This is my first HDTV so I was careful about which one to buy. I use almost every input on the tv. I have my Xbox 360 and PS3 and HD cable box hooked up via HDMI. Some of you may think how i have 3 HDMI sources hooked into two on the TV, my sound system has a splitter built in. I have my computer hooked up via VGA though I have stoped using it because 1080p is such high eez the text although clear was small from 8 ft away. I have my Wii DVD player hooked up via component. I do own the HD dvd add on for my Xbox 360 and it is amazing picture quality. I also have Blu-ray as it is built in to the PS3. In my opinion the HD DVD looks better as it uses VC-1 for most of its movies. While Ble-ray uses some unfinished Java and there for in some scenes there is a grainy look. It has gotten much better with newer movies such as Night at the Museum. I always buy a movie on HD DVD if I can. Now back to the TV, SD is okay  but i don't really watch it other than Daily Show & Colbert Report. HD looks stunning and UI have no complain on the black levels. 6000:1 is great although 10000:1 is what I would have liked but is too expensive on an LCD. The Piano finish looks great and classy. I can not watch anything with the built in speakers as I am used to a 5.1 system and recommend getting something for audio. Games look great in HD but the Wii is not meant for any HD let alone a 1080p TV. Does not really matter i hardly use it as it is. The 360 doubles as an up-convert DVD player. I just watched Lost season one and two as well as the first season of Rome on DVD and it looked amazing on this HDTV, you may even think of them as HD releases.I am totally happy with this HDTV in more ways than I can count.

When I saw what standard cable looked like, sad to say, they were right.  The picture seemed squished and not very clear.  I mean the picture is bearable but given the TV's technology, it can do better.  That's why I'm going to order an HD cable box.Now on to the good stuff.  I hooked up my PS3 via HDMI and I was dazzled.  The menu is displayed in 1080p.  Everything is so small but so sharp.  Popped in COD3 (which played in 720p, not 1080i but I don't mind) and as expected, the picture was stunning.  Might not be the most colorful game.  But it was certainly impressive.  PS1 and PS2 games look good for the most part.  But given the age of the other two platforms, you shouldn't expect to be blown away like you would for higher resolution PS3 and X-BOX 360 games.I popped in a couple DVDs (that's right, DVDs and not Blu-Rays) and the picture was breathtaking.  I watched Final Fantasy: Advent Children, Billy Madison, and Family Guy to name a few and the detail and color was simply amazing (and according to the TV, these are being played at 480p).  I thought I was watching a Blu-Ray.  I can only imagine what a 1080p Blu-Ray will look like.The glossy black frame and stand are very sleek.  The internal speakers, while clear and accurate, are nothing to write home about.  For a TV, that performs as good as it looks, treat it to a home theatre system.  It deserves it.One may hesitate to purchase a TV now with the development of laser TV underway and the considerably better features it will have (weighs less, consumes less power, greater color gamut, etc.).

I have noticed in hindsight that no OTA HD signals are in 1080p, just 1080i.

It was then a slippery slope to the larger and much more expensive LN-S4095D, but owning the previous model for a week makes for a good reference to the upgrade.Contrast, color, and response time:  At 6000:1, the contrast is impressive, most dramatically in regular lighting conditions.  Though the blacks still don't achieve the inky blacks of plasma, and aren't nearly as dramatic in a darkened room, they're a substantial improvement over my previous model.  Color is vibrant and saturated - I have no complaints here.  Response time is good, I've noticed none of the 'streaking' that I've read about in earlier LCD televisions. I have noticed a subtle blurring of detail between things in motion and those that are still, but this is probably to be expected and maybe even preferred.  Note that the 8ms response time is the same on the  32\" model.Detail:  Actors and news anchors, I can see your pores!  The highest detail I've seen, keep in mind that this is interlaced from broadcast 720p to the native resolution 1080p, which means a 1080i picture (where the television 'reads between the lines' to infer the missing data).  I have yet to see a full 1080p resolution as I'm not yet willing to drop $$$ for a blu-ray or HD-DVD player - but I'm already impressed.Physical design:  This is where I am most disappointed, and for which I would probably consider returning the TV if it didn't require renting a van to do so.  While the shape and proportion is an improvement over the `V' shaped Vulcan style of previous models, I am convinced the piano black lacquer finish is the worst possible surface for any LCD television.  Aside from the bling bling styling that is sure to look painfully dated in just a few years, the finish magnifies the televisions contrast issues.  Simple rule - if you want to increase the perceived intensity of something, place something of lower intensity next to it.  There is nothing with higher contrast than polished black lacquer with swirling reflections, and the picture looks washed and grey by comparison to it.  Add to that that the reflections can be distracting and even fatiguing, and you have to really start wondering whether Samsung gave this any thought at all.  On the other hand, if you own a Cadillac Escalade with spinning rims, this TV is definitely for you.One last note:  if you're planning on wall mounting your television, which I highly recommend, I found a very nice articulating arm, wall mount system at Costco for $99 (compare to systems at Best Buy that start at $250).  It holds up to 80 lbs, has a very nice industrial silver finish, and was very easy to install - the TV was on the wall and on in about thirty minutes.", "Date": "August 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture, sub-par sound", "Author": "Kirk Salmon", "ReviewID": "R3H20YABJQL01B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, don't let the sub-par sound from this product scare you away.

So if you have a Home Theater amplifier hidden in a closet that automatically turns on when it detects sound you have to attach this amplifier to the headphone jack. If you have a home theater amplifier that you control with its own remote then this will work good for you. The TV also has a problem that if you setup the different channels to receive true picture size, ie: 480i transmission displayed in the 4:3 format and 720i and 1080i displayed in the 16:9 format once in a while when you change channels the TV will not sense the transmission format correctly and will just go blank.  You can not change to another channel and you can not turn the set off with the remote.  You must unplug the set to reset it.

To get the richest blacks I recommend putting a floor lamp behind or next to the TV. If you have any lights in front of it then the blacks won't look as rich because you'll be comparing it to the Piano Black Finish of the TV's frame which is really black so the blacks on the screen will look kind of grey. You will definitely have to play around with the picture settings to get the best out of it. I've found that anything connected via HDMI will look lighter than stuff connected via Component cables so I have different picture settings for each.As for SHIPPING. Yes it was free which was good and the TV actually shipped the next day and was in NYC within 3 days but I had to wait till the 7th day to get it delivered to my apt because EAGLE shipping couldn't get it to me till then. I also had to take off work for the WHOLE day because their delivery time was between 9 and 4pm (they came at 3:40pm). It was only 1 guy, he drove the truck and delivered the TV. He said he wasn't required to deliver above the 3rd floor (I live on the 4th) so I had to promise him a tip and I had to actually help him carry the TV all the way up. Then he just opened the box and left. He did not set it up (or even wait till I set it up myself to check whether it was defective). I grew up in NYC so this kind of bad customer service is normal here but for some reason I actually expected a little more from Amazon. I'm sure Eagle Shipping is good in other states but in NYC it is not very good and I think Amazon needs to do something about that. Maybe they need to use a different delivery company when delivering to NYC.Also, Amazon didn't give me a refund when I saw the price go down $100 after I bought it. Their customer service rep didn't call me back till after the price had gone back up so they wouldn't give me the refund because when they finally got around to checking the price it wasn't lower anymore. Since then I've exchanged several emails with them and still no luck. Shame on you Amazon. The tv is great but their customer service has been horrible so I probably won't be making anymore big purchases from them.", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV !!!", "Author": "Saurabh Gupta", "ReviewID": "RS27WEB8BTJSE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its my first HD TV and I love it ....

Real black black and high brilliance, compared to others I have seen in the store. The eyes can tell it.+ Remote is great, except you would have to browse the shortcut menu to the thing that you want. Could be better with just 1 button for picture and sound.+ Lots of Input and Output ports, HDMIx2, Componentx2, PC input -- excellent for many different video players.+ Great price per length for a 40\" 1080p TV :-)What I don't like about the TV:- Sound quality sucks, sounds like an old radio. You really need external speakers with bass and everything. The internal speakers are there just for the purpose of being \"included\".- The tuner. I am using off-antenna, desktop. Picture quality is real bad for channels that are supposed to be clearer. I compared the picture quality of this internal tuner vs. the external Samsung Tuner n Digital noise filter barely makes any difference on channels that have noise.OVERALL, I am keeping the LCD.", "Date": "December 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good when it works.", "Author": "J. levine", "ReviewID": "R3TA61AOPS1XX0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this item from Amazon and it arrived in a hurry.  Worked for one day then failed. Half the screen was good the other half was green.  Called Samsung.  They sent a repairman.  Set not fixable.  Took seven weeks and numerous calls to get it replaced.  Finally get a call that they will ship.  Carrier says it will arrive at 7:00 am.  Too early?  Too bad! You want it, that's when we are coming.  You don't, you can wait for another appointment.  Called Samsung, cuz  now I startin' to get pissed off.  Customer service geek tells me: \" Hey, we're a multi-national company.
