Villanueva", "ReviewID": "R3EKSFR0U4RHO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this television to replace an ailing Samsung plasma that I'd had for about 10 years.  The picture is bright and crisp, as expected from an LCD, but of course the blacks are not as deep as my old plasma TV.  Still, the picture quality is solid, and it's about 10 pounds lighter than my previous 42 inch.  I like the positioning of the inputs: you don't have to crush your cables when wall-mounting the TV anymore (which is what eventually killed my old Samsung).The speakers are mediocre.  They're a bit tinny, and when the EQ is set to amplify the lower frequencies the low end sounds very hollow.  When using the audio outs, though, and running it through home theater speakers, it sounds great.  My old Samsung had a little delay when using the audio outs that I'd attributed to my 20 year old receiver, and it turns out that it was the Samsung's fault.  I'm very pleased with the RCA now that it's integrated into my home theater system, and use the TV speakers as a center speaker in the home theater setup.Hard to beat this TV for the price.UPDATE:  ...And after 9 days of use, 1/2 of the LCD panel died.  Amazon would have accepted the return, but I tossed the original packaging.  Crap.  Called RCA and they're sending a tech to my house to fix it in a couple of days.  I'm disappointed, but I'll post how the repair service goes.UPDATE ON WARRANTY SERVICE:  Since I'm an idiot, I just assumed Amazon wouldn't send out a replacement TV without me sending the return first.  Of course they'll send a replacement out as long as you return the other TV within 30 days, so I'm using the packaging from that TV to send back the defective one.  Tech support guy did come out (provided by A&E; Factory Service for RCA) and determined it was either a power supply problem or a defective panel.  Ordering new parts would take a week, so I'm returning the TV to Amazon instead.  Interesting thing that the Tech pointed out to me: the panel and the power supply were manufactured by Samsung.  TV set was assembled in China, of course.Dropped my rating by a star because of this quality issue, but I have to say I'm pleased with Amazon's service and at least the promptness of the warranty service.UPDATE ON LONGEVITY:  I've had the replacement for over a year and a half now, and it's worked splendidly.

I have a 46\" Sharp LCD that I can compare this to (which cost a lot more), and this RCA stands up pretty well next to it. Picture quality is really good, sound is clear, menus are easy to use, remote is quite nice, and I've yet to find any problems. I was able to setup my Tivo remote to control this TV without any issue.Not to get off topic, but I'd previously purchased a TCL 40\" from Amazon and sent it back due to the horrible sound, no universal remote seeming to work with it, and annoyance with the on screen menu. This RCA has none of the problems the TCL had. That could be why I'm extra happy with this TV.

Some will say never to pay attention to a review but when you're buying merchandise online, sometimes you rely on customer reviews.So I ordered this t.v. 2 months ago for under five hundred dollars.  I have it hooked up to my surround sound and bluray player.  We don't care for satellite or cable so we use basic rabbit ear antenna which picks up all the local HD channels.  I also have a pc that I built to the RCA to view youtube and other internet content.OTA channels look amazing.  Bluray movies blew my mind.  The detail that this t.v. can produce with bluray content is jaw dropping.  HD videos from youtube and vimeo also shocked me.  Just amazing quality.  The remote is nice and just about any universal remote will work with this t.v.  The sound is good but while watching basic t.v. I don't need loud audio.  While watching bluray I do turn up the sound but through my surround sound.Anyway, my neighbor came over to check it out one day and he couldn't believe 'RCA' could make such awesome tv's.  He actually has a more expensive Sony (think he paid $1000 for his 46\") and he thought the quality was the same.Just want to say that I always try to get the best bang for my buck with anything that I buy.  Many items that I get are usually purchased online so I do rely on customer reviews.I'm extremely satisfied with the t.v. and highly recommend it.

Right out of the box, it was very easy to set it up. My roommate and I put the whole thing together without really having to read the manuel (we glanced at it to make sure we were doing everything right, and we were, it was all very intuitive).The picture quality is great, not overblown like the TVs in the store are (they're trying to showcase how bright everything is, but the color balance is actually way off).The sound is pretty good, not the best. The way our living room is set up, we don't have the TV against a wall; there is open space behind the TV. I think that's why the sound isn't very good because there is no wall to deflect the sound toward the audience. But, if I just turn up the TV just a little, I can hear everything fine. One thing I learned is not to mess too much with the pre-installed sound settings. I tried this and then the speakers would get all fuzzy when there was a lot of bass in the audio... like the speakers would rattle inside the set or something.All I gotta do is find a good set of external speakers to shoot the sound forward instead of out the back, and I'll be set!I would recommend this TV for anyone.

If you do a more thorough search for this exact model you will find the exact same issues with it from customer complaints. I've had this TV for about 6 months and during this time it was excellent but then it started getting a very thin blue line from the top to the bottom of the screen on the left side. This was not on the screen everyday, but it came and went for a few days then suddenly one day the thin blue line is a thick 3 inch lighter colored line from the top to bottom of screen again left side. This stayed there each time I turned on the TV for a few days. After this the light colored line is now filled with different colors which move on top of the picture of your screen. I took videos and photos of this which I will be posting for your viewing pleasure. It's still under manufacturer's warranty but it makes me wonder about getting it fixed or replaced with the same model because I have a feeling this will happen again. Then I'm out over $500. Do a search for blue line on my RCA tv and see what you find. It's amazing how those old school square box tv's lasted for over 20yrs but some new LED model doesn't even make it a year! Disappointed customer.*UPDATE on 10/29* I called the manufacturer which is a company called On Corp, turns out the TV is made in China and not by RCA (the repairman actually informed me of this and let me know that they have been repairing these TV's for months now with the same issue each time) It had a faulty panel and now I have to wait a few weeks for the part to come in, then they will install it for me. I am wondering if this happens again and my TV is out of warranty by then, then what?

VanDenEng", "ReviewID": "R3LB2DNDBPAWQ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The wife and I decided it was time for a TV upgrade. We bought a 37\" LCD a few years ago for our small apartment, but now that prices have dropped so much we decided to get something bigger and toss the 37\" in the bedroom. I shopped around and did the research and found this 46\" RCA for a steal of a price (less than the current price on Amazon) at a local electronics store. Went in to check it out in person and the picture quality was very good. It didn't quite match up to the Samsungs and Sonys that were also on display there, but it was significantly better quality than the Dynex and other similarly priced bargain televisions. Both my wife and I agreed this RCA was far less \"grainy\" than the Dynex LCD TV of the same size and price.So we went ahead and bought it, and brought it home, and set it up. Easy enough setup - just 6 screws to attach the stand to the tv, but the stand is a bit flimsy. The television rocks/sways easily if you push on it slightly. Not a deal breaker, especially if you plan to wall mount, but it should be noted. The stand is not good.The other issue I have is there's one \"stuck\" pixel near the middle of the screen. I did some research and apparently it's a common thing, and they can fix themselves. There are also other methods of fixing them that are supposedly 80% succesful. I'm just going to exchange it for a new one, but I wanted to mention it in the review. The stuck pixel is white and very distracting, although only noticable during dark/black scenes, other than that it blends right in and is completely invisible.It's a great bang for your buck LCD TV. Just don't expect a Samsung/Sony/etc. As far as affordable LCD TV's go, this is the one you want. If you want something more high performance, you should probably spend the 200-300 extra for a fancier model. I'm satisfied (except for the pixel issue, which is probably a rare thing) with this tv for the price I paid. It has plenty of HDMI ports and adjustment options for picture quality. One thing I can't comment on is the sound.

When I hooked it up I really liked the big screen and noticed it was much lighter. I also really liked the hook ups for the HDMI cables. The picture was good not as great as my LG, Sony, or Samsung. I was happy with it for the price and size. The speakers were a bit quieter and I noticed i had to turn it up alot to hear it more than my other tv. I did watch some blue rays and used my suroond sound and it was great. The bad thing was I was watching the championship playoff nfl games and the thing just turned off and died. It would not turn back on at all. I only had it for less than 2 weeks. Now I am haveing a difficult time getting it warrentied. I will update this when something happens.

I have it paired with a Yamaha/sony surround sound system and it just works beautifully. When I got the tv it was only $450. That was a great price at the time and I just had to take it. The tv doesn't have the best sound but it's not terrible whatsoever so plan on getting speakers if sound is a big factor for you. Also just know your not paying for a 1000 dollar tv so the picture although it is amazing for the price it is not a top top top of the line tv like a Samsung for instance....looking at the price now I probably wouldn't have gotten the tv if it was at this price but if you do your research and get it for a great price like I did, it'll be worth your while. (got mine from Walmart)Ps-the red bar at the bottom is not on mineEDIT:i came back to warn buyers of this tv.  this particular model has a very bad history of having bad panels.  mine was bad and I had to return it to RCA and have a new one sent out.  the process took a total time of about a month from start to finish and had some stressful moments.  dont buy this tv at this price either.  I bought mine about a year ago when TV's were slightly more expensive and I got it on sale for 450.

I decided to buy the 46\" because of the price and it was the best thing we ever did. I just bought the 42\" for another room in our house a month later. I have used the 42\" a few times and wow it is great. RCA isn't LG or Sony if you try to hold it up to those then you will for sure be sad. It is a TV, if it looks good and has sound then don't sit there are wish you had an LG or Sony. I would buy more of these tvs because they are great and i got it for only 480 so that is a steal in itself when it is going for 610 at walmart right now :DWhat is this about the picture speed is to slow. I would check to see if you have cable or satellite because this tv has just as great picture speed as any other so it is probably your cable/satellite box or old dvd player. thanks amazon for a great tv at a great price.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for Price", "Author": "Goliath201", "ReviewID": "R2J6ZL014UTD9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice TV and well worth the money.

I love how RCA sees true colors and how easy they make it to adjust the colors and contrast to your liking. I love this TV I had my xbox, computer and cable box connected to HDMI ports and it was beautiful. But after 2 months the GREEN line began. After about a week we called RCA and they sent a Sears tech the next day that guy said it was a bad pannel and I will get a call within a week. the green line was getting bigger. We did and that call told us we will be gettimg another call about shipping a new TV. About 2 weeks later we did get another call asking if we still had the box.now we have 2 lines. We did not so we had to wait about 2 weeks more for a new box. We then set the TV back using FED EX paid for by RCA and then found out it took 7 days for them to get the tv. We sent it back May 30th and today is June 12 and we haven't recieve any info from RCA on when we will be getting our new TV. WE dont have any number nothing but our reipt of the TV to say that we even had the TV. We are getting concerned about getting a TV back, noone from RCA is picking up thier phone.So its a GREAT price for the TV. I just hope you get the good one.

At the time of writing this review, the value space in this area is dominated by 720P Plasma screens.

After basic adjustments to brightness and contrast, the darks are dark, colors really pop, and the screen delivers a very smooth, pleasant viewing experience. Is it as nice as a high-end screen costing ten times as much? Of course not. But it can play movies, online content (Netflix, etc), and OTA HDTV brilliantly.The TV itself is pretty lightweight, easy to setup, and the remote control is nothing fancy but gets the job done.
