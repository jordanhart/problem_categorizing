{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid 3.5 stars, some annoyances", "Author": "SomeAmazonCustomer", "ReviewID": "R1M4VT735FF5T5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "TV arrived on time (2 days!) and worked no problem. No dead pixels or anything like that. Plugged in power and HDMI and it worked. TV works quite well.... once you take the time to set it up, but the setup is really no fun. More details in pros/cons.Cons:- Default settings include dynamic contrast ON (which works well for some scenes but for most it completely changes what the show/movie creators intended) and really bad default color balance. Not too surprising, they usually set them to look really bright for stores. This could be okay, if changing the settings was easy, but...- Changing settings is a PAIN IN THE ASS!! They have a remote control with a touch-sensitive area, but all you can do with it is Up, Down, Left, Right and Click! So really, it may as well have been 4 arrow buttons with a select button in the middle, which would be far more intuitive to use. It's just a useless gimmick IMO.- Changing settings is bad in general, but then for display settings, it gets worse! The settings are all over the place... to change the scene's color balance there are literally over 30 different levers you can play with. This is good if you like to control things, like I do, but bad when the interface is slow, bad to use, and very disorganized. It took me more than 4 hours of tweaking to get a good color balance where you can see dark regions well and not have the brights be washed out. I'll post my settings at the bottom so others don't have to suffer as much.- Not this TV's fault, but 3D TV seems like a gimmick for home entertainment... it works, but unless you sit 3 feet away from the TV, it's not going to be immersive because it makes the borders of the TV more prominent somehow.- Small recommended viewing angle... side viewing is not particularly good (colors and contrast deteriorate fairly quickly if you watch from the sides).Pros:- Excellent picture quality (albeit only inside the viewing angle), once you take the time to set it up (see above for problems, see below for my recommended settings).- It automatically downloaded a patch over wifi when I first started it, and that worked very smoothly.- Looks sleek/good (physically).- Easy to install, plug in and start watching TV (again though, it will take time to set up the picture exactly the way you want).- Some neat 'Smart TV' features (e.g. one HDMI source picture-in-picture with another HDMI source), though I haven't used those a lot yet.Anyway, here are all the picture settings I finally settled on. It doesn't matter what order you do them in, except you HAVE TO DO THE FIRST ONE BEFORE THE REST (if you change picture mode later, it changes all the settings). Also, keep in mind that the display will look weird until you finish doing ALL the settings, so don't stop halfway because it looks weird! There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks. Do all the settings, and only AFTER THAT, if you don't like how it looks, you can either tweak from there, or just reset to defaults (eays to do) and start over. Trust me on this.Main Picture Menu:- Picture Mode: Movie (set this before any of the rest!!)- Backlight: 10-20 (based on preference and ambient light in room, you can change this at the end to your liking)- Contrast: 100- Brightness: 52- Sharpness: 60- Color: 51- Tint: G50/R50 (center)- Picture Size: Screen Fit (otherwise you could very well lose some pixels)Advanced Settings:- Dynamic Contrast: Off- Black Tone: off- Flesh Tone: -5- RGB Only Mode: Off- Color Space: Custom--- Red: 61, 0, 0--- Green: 0, 50, 0--- Blue: 0, 8, 54--- Yelow: 89, 77, 0--- Cyan: 0, 50, 50--- Magenta: 53, 0, 50- White Balanace:--- R-Offset: 23--- G-Offset: 18--- B-Offset: 22--- R-Gain: 22--- G-Gain: 31--- B-Gain: 26- Gamma: +1- 10p White Balance: Off (trust me, not worth it!! Unless you have a professional calibration tool)Picture options:- Color Tone: Warm2- Digital Clean View: Auto- MPEG Noice Filter: Off (removes details from many scenes)- HDMI Black Level: Low- Auto Motion Plus: Standard- Cinema Black: MediumHope this helps somebody out there!! I tested those settings with Game of Thrones (lots of dark scenes), anime (lots of bright scenes) and a lot of photos (lots of everything!), and at least for me, they work great in all cases.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Spectacular Picture - 4-5 Star review", "Author": "Kingsfan 760 \"Kings Fan\"", "ReviewID": "RDDZR34GOPGPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched this TV by looking at all the online reviews for the model ES7100, ES8000 & F8000 Samsung models. I went to Best Buy and watched the F7100 on live TV (baseball game). Reading that the gesture and voice commands caused issues, auto-dimming and higher 720 motion ratings many not make that much difference in overall performance - except in price (up to $400), I took the F7100 into consideration. There is a Quad vs. Dual processor down grade with the F7100. I leaned more towards the F7100 because of price vs. features, 3rd model down from the top. I actually enjoy messing with picture settings and making the picture perfect. I ordered online and purchased a 3 year warranty at a very good price. I was nervous about reading the one star reviews but I am also coming from a 10 year old Samsung 46\" DLP TV that has worked flawlessly the whole time. I thought I would take the plunge and glad I did. I wanted an LED TV vs. a Plasma, but in the store they both looked great.I've had this UN55F7100 Samsung model for about a week now. I would rate it between 4 to 5 stars and here's why.After a few hours of playing with the picture settings and advanced settings, using a Time Warner cable box with HDMI connection, the picture is spectacular for 95% of the HD content. The other 5% is due to the \"soap opera\" effect or some minor juddering but not enough to sway me. Sometimes it almost seems \"too clear\" (I guess that why it is called soap opera). I read in one of the reviews to turn off the \"Digital Noise\" setting and custom reduce the juddering in the advance settings. That seems to work.I love to watch my sports, specifically hockey and with the Stanley Cup Playoffs currently playing, to me it is like watching it Live- Awesome picture. The TV is awesome with sports and I did NOT encounter any juddering with the puck or players. The ice, people and play was just so enjoyable I was glued to the screen. No \"soap opera\" effects with sports. The dark and black scenes are super crisp & pitch black, better than I have ever seen on any other DLP or LED TV. Flesh tones are mixed in standard setting with some picture calibration of the settings I was able to get them very good. Most of the time the flesh tone is excellent, other times a little off. I think it really has more to do with the HD content. Example: American Idol the flesh tone was perfect, in commercials; some are perfect others not so much.Set up was easy although the user manual is very light in content. 2D to 3D is cool but not why I bought it. Looking to play 3D Blu-ray on my new OPPO Player I purchased from Amazon. (I'll be reviewing that soon). The internet set up was easy but login process and apps are clumsy. I have not been able to check out for very long so it could be user error on my part. I was able to launch a movie menu but have not paid for one yet. Tried to launch Netflix but that was not successful, I need more time to investigate. The TV guide loaded from the cable box however changing the channels using the TV did not change the channel (I have to use the cable remote like before on my old TV), again something I need to investigate before I determine it is a TV issue however it did recognize the guide and lists the programs. The firmware did update fine. Sound is OK and the TV has a few different sound settings but nothing special. The HDMI inputs are on one side of the TV and power cord on the other side. Small detail but interferes with some cable management. The stand/base is for the most part sturdy & swivels but it is plastic and not metal as I was expecting. For a 55\" TV you need 2 people to properly put it together, but it is up in about 20 minutes.I did not buy the TV for the \"Smart HUB/internet\" (but did buy the OPPO Blu-ray player for Netflix) and I did not buy it for the sound as I have an Onkyo receiver and JBL speakers. I DID buy it for the best LED TV & picture. My wife and mother-in-law just love the picture and can't get over the clarity on shows like Idol, Dateline, Criminal Minds, etc.. Friends can't believe the great picture. Overall I love the TV and hopefully soon will work through the other things like \"Smart Hub\" and the \"Recommendation Guide\" built in the TV.Star Rating: 4-1/2 stars overall, 5 stars on sports, 5 stars on Black/Dark Scenes, 4 stars \"Soap Opera\" effect (Still working on settings), Internet/Guide 3 stars for now until I get that resolved, Samsung service has been great but I only did \"Chat\" asking about TV Internet Set up.I'm sure with all new products there are going to be some that out of the box are not good, for me, it has worked great since set up and running it for about a week. I also read it takes over a month for the colors to \"settle in\". Non-HD picture is just OK - but I came from a DLP TV so I would compare it as the same as my old TV. This TV is made for Blu-ray and HD content.I tried to be as clear as possible in my review because I know there are others who may spend a lot of money for a TV. Yes it is expensive, but I also spent a lot on a Blu-ray player because I want the Ferrari TV. Yes, for the money is should be perfect, and it's not, but from what I saw in with my eyes and reading the reviews, I'm glad I chose the F7100 Samsung.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV!", "Author": "Delphimpd", "ReviewID": "R1Q0P0V05M1621", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome TV.Initially I went to hhgregg and purchased the SHARP 70 inch 3D TV and when I hanged on my Home Theater wall, there was something that told me that this was not the right TV for me, the colors were not all that, so I packed it back in the box and exchanged for this SAMSUNG TV. So, went back home did the same operations, of hanging it to my wall, connect it to the outlet, and this baby was on and displaying his amazing colors in less than 5 seconds compared to others LED TVs that sometimes it takes a healthy 20 to 30 seconds for the image to come on. I was presented with the initial setup, this was easy, connecting to my home wireless was a snap, it recognized my DISH Network box, and my other components I had installed immediately . This TV brings all the goodies, a Browser (Great Browser) with PIP (Picture in Picture) so you can browse and watch TV at the same time,  Netflix App, Youtube, the 3D mini channel etc. It comes with four 3D glasses, simple and very comfortable glasses, very light. The remote control can't be easier to manipulate small and simple, but it brings a very interesting button which I didn't even knew that this TV was equipped with it and is a little tiny microphone on top of the remote control. I pressed this microphone button and I found myself talking to a TV for the first time in my life, I started giving some commands like \"Menu\" etc and this was a pleasure time. The remote control has a touch pad kind mouse that works like a laptop mouse touch pad so that you can navigate from menu to menu up, down left or right, and when you are ready to click just press the touch pad and done, the remote is also equipped with a backlight, this is a plus. Moving on to the TV gadgets, it comes with a bunch of the USB ports and another bunch of HDMI ports as well a 3mm jack port for your sound and a RF so you can interact with your cable or satellite box, and also components RCA ports for your Xbox, PS3 etc. After setting up, I decided to experiment with the 3D mini channel that comes with the Samsung Apps, and Oh my God! There is a 3D Shark documentary and for the first time in my life I experimented real time 3D experience, I thought that I was under the water viewing all the fishes around me, they come out of the TV when you are watching this amazing documentary, and you actually want to touch them, my 6 year son, was also watching with me and he started to grab the fishes coming out of the TV, however when the big shark appeared in the screen, he then removed his 3D Glasses and ran away from the room and never again want it to watch this underwater documentary. The colors of this TV can't be more vivid and real than the real thing. You can also get live TV, and convert it from 2D to 3D, and experience 3D viewing, however it's not as any original 3D movie or 3D filmed program.  I went to the built in browser, and it was like having my laptop browser in front of me, with the exception that the typing and the clicking was not the best experience, this forced me to go into Amazon and order a Bluetooth Keyboard; I was told in a local store (Not in hhgregg) that I had to buy the Smart Keyboard from Samsung in order to be able to use the Bluetooth keyboard  capability, and for my surprise this was not true, I went to Amazon.com and purchase the Azio KB338BO Bluetooth keyboard for about 40 dollars, it arrived like in about 4 days. Connected the USB dong that comes with the keyboard to one of the USB ports, went to the TV device manager, keyboards and that was it, the TV recognized the Keyboard. I then went to the browser, moved the mouse to the address bar, tapped on the mouse pad of my new keyboard, typed google.com and I was on my way with my new TV and keyboard, by pressing F4, or F5 it will bring the TV Smart Hub into the screen, also by pressing the right button of the mouse pad will bring you some TV Options. Moving along, I went to the TV Youtube app to watch some youtube videos and for my surprise, I pressed a button from one of the Youtube buttons and the TV asked me if I want to link my mobile device with the TV, so I did, I was presented with a number code in which I had to enter in my HTC mobile device and my phone was linked to my new TV that was cool!, I then selected a video to watch in my mobile device's youtube app, but for my surprise, the video did not play in my mobile device, instead, started to play in my new 65inch Samsung TV, vivid colors!!. The sound quality without any extra help like a Surround system attached to it , was good enough for a room; however, if you would like to experience a full home theater drill, I suggest a Surround System. I attached my 5.1 system to it and instead of saving money in GEICO am saving some money in the movie theater. I went to my next experience, which it was Netflix, since I am a member, the movie experience is  night after night. So, to conclude this long review I suggest this TV to anyone who doesn't want something huge, but nether something small, this TV is the way to go; you won't regret it, at least I didn't, so I hope that this review helps you to decide.Good Luck!", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "The truth about this set.", "Author": "Big Richard", "ReviewID": "R1HULYLI9OOC9P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Edit:  I've discovered something.  If you use clear motion, turn cinema black off and set the black enhancement off.  It results in a MUCH smoother image with minimal tearing.

I know this is what people look for the most: Slight black light bleed in the corners, app store has limited selection, and quite a few existing apps are sub par or don't even work at all, and the active 3D isn't very comfortable.So let's go over this small cons list of mine:The black light bleed - It's is most noticeable when the back light is set to 20 and the entire screen goes black.  I don't find this to be much of an issue, however, since I set my black light to 10.  Can you believe it?  I can't.  10 is more than enough with this set.  I think because it's 3D they gave it a nice strong black light and 10 is about where normal viewing should be.  3D mode switches over to 20 since the active 3D glasses go a bit dark when enabled.The app store - I have everything I need, but I know this set is capable of so much more.  I honestly am considering, as a software developer, looking into what it takes to create apps.  Coming from Android, I'm used to a plethora of apps, but the Samsung Smart TV app store is pretty obscure and definitely has fewer users, so not as many users.  Regardless, the existing apps do everything I expected this TV to do.  I just wish I found things I didn't expect lol.Sub par apps - As a developer, this kind of irritated me.  I installed about 10 apps and uninstalled them because of how useless they were.  For instance, there's a weather channel app (I think it was weather channel) but to find your region it isn't intuitive like entering a zip code, you have to find the nearest city, and you have to scroll through the entire list to do so.  What on earth!?  This thing has internet connectivity, it's a simple data fetch, why not allow people to enter zip codes?  Another app that stands out is the Moviefone app.  I use the Android version to look up movie times for theaters around.  The smart TV app?  Just previews.  Really?  Why even waste everyone's time?  Previews are available on like 10 different apps.  BROKEN apps include Plex and HBO Go.  Plex can't seem to make a connection to my server, and HBO Go constantly says I can't be logged in at this time.3D comfort -  The deal I got on this set was too hard to pass up (not at amazon), and the LG passive 3D set I was looking at admittedly felt much more comfortable to watch in 3D.  So what's the difference between active 3D and passive 3D?  Active 3D requires the powered glasses, passive doesn't.  Active 3D does a great job at depth, passive does a much better job at making things jump out at you.  Active 3D maintains the sharp image while passive 3D seems to cut the resolution in half (maybe 4k passive will be the \"sweet spot\".)  So when I talk about comfort, I'm talking mainly about your eyes adjusting to an image.  Passive is more comfortable, active can cause headaches.  The best thing to do with active 3D is to just relax and keep your head still I think.  Furthermore, the 3D glasses that came with this set are quite uncomfortable on your face.  I think they're designed to work with people wearing glasses or something.The reason I list the cons first is because I'm not gonna give you a bunch of BS about how awesome the set is without informing you of what you're getting into first.  I'm VERY picky.  These are the things that bothered me the most.  If you can live with them, then you'll be fine.Why is this set 5 stars in spite of the cons?  Because it's truly THAT awesome.  The smooth motion 240hz effect blows my mind.  The brightness, the contrast, and the color accuracy right out the box is NUTS.  Even though quad core is out, the dual core in this set still delivers very smooth menus and functions.  It's just an all around insanely awesome TV.  I'm a tech freak and I am very pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buyer beware. Samsung won't honor its warranty.", "Author": "M. Settles", "ReviewID": "R1FUVMPUT2WH2Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My UN65F7100, manufactured in Sept. 2013 and received Oct. 26 has two light-colored, thumb-sized dead spots in the center of the screen (they look similar to a pressure points) about six inches down from the top and 10 inches apart. These spots show up on all lighter-colored scenes and especially when there is movement in the video (a pan). If you're at all experienced with video production or are into picture quality, the light spots will be all you see.If you go to Samsung's website and look at reviews for the 7100 series, you'll see another reviewer had the same problem and includes a photo of the dead spot.The last three weeks, I've spent hours on the phone with Samsung and the \"Executive Customer Relations\" department seeking a remedy. While the local TV technician they sent to photograph/document the problem and Samsung's ECR customer service reps agree the spots don't appear to be within specification, I'm told the Panel Evaluation Department has looked at the photos and determined the white spots are \"within factory specs.\" Samsung is refusing to fix this manufacturing defect (they said I would have to pay for a new 65\" panel).For years, I've been an enthusiastic Samsung customer, but this experience has been horrible. If Samsung won't honor its warranty and correct a manufacturing defect on a big-ticket item, I would suggest you'd be wise to look to other TV manufacturers...ones willing to stand behind their products.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "GORGEOUS TV & PICTURE QUALITY  (other comparisons in this review as well)", "Author": "Brandy.A.", "ReviewID": "R14J9KB96MNLUC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the market for 2 TV's with 3D and apps.  One for the living room the other the bedroom.  I'm a tech geek and I know what to look for.  I also do a lot of homework by reading forums, reviews, etc on any type of electronic before I make a purchase.  To put it mildly, I'm a very picky lady.  You need to be picky, after all, it's your money and these things are not cheap.  In the end after all of my exhausted efforts on other TV's,  I purchased the Samsung UN46F7100.  I also purchased the UN60F8000.  I couldn't be happier.  In fact, I'm completely thrilled.In the end yes, I spent more than I had originally set out to do.  Do I regret it.  Absolutely not!  No buyer's remorse here.  My first Samsung ever, btw and  I have been in total awe ever since.  Perfect packaging, it felt like Christmas.  Perfect screen, flawless stunning picture.  So real it's unbelivable.  No pixelation issues.  Beautiful design, even prettier than the current LG and thinner! Extremely light weight too, yet solid.  The stand is solid! Although, I love the UNF8000 model stand better.  The TV looks as if it is floating in mid air.  One reviewer from CNET stated they felt Samsung was giving away the ultra 4K in 8000 model.  I have to agree.  I have never seen anything so perfect in a TV.  However, this 7100 model is just as good and no real discernible difference in quality.  Apps are great, setup easy.  Tons of content for families.  Educational apps for kids.  Fitness apps, you name it.  Nearly all Apps are free.  Pandora, Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, VUDU, YouTube, Crackle, Web Browser, tons of 3D content -the most I have seen on any TV.  Interface simple, clean, beautiful.  Fast and Snappy.  No issues here.  3D awesome!  Gaming, nearly no lag unlike the LG which was horrible!  Upscaling and 2D-3D conversion is much better than LG.  Out of box configuration excellent.  Minor if any calibration needed.  Picture just stunning.  I am a very happy Lady now.  My husband is happy that I'm happy...finally!  Props to Samsung and their quality control.  You can read more of my review on my purchase of the Samsung UN60F8000 here at Amazon dated Sept. 10, 2013.CONS:  Although the UN60F8000 was completely perfect in every way, my 7100 model did have a little flash-lighting of bright light in the corners.  Very noticeable in dark scenes.  But, there is a quick fix if you find you have this problem.  Simply loosen the screws at the back of the TV in those corners.  Problem gone!  Perfect screen with lighting issue gone!  Completely black scenes.PROS:  Everything!  Can you tell how happy I am?  3D great, Glasses comfortable, light.  Apps, tons of them!  Fitness, educational, games, and nearly all are free.  Unlike LG's which has a lack of content and apps and charge for almost every app they offer. Interface clean and simple, soothing blue's as the primary color of the interface and Apps interface.  Apps I love are Amazon Instant, Hulu, VUDU, Pandora, Media Hub, Crackle, HBO GO, SHOwtime, Netflix, and more. Tons of 3D content.  Children will be entertained for hours.  A lot of FREE 3D content as well.  2D-3D conversion works better than LG, and Vizio lacks this feature, plus Vizio does not make a 3D TV below 50\".  Upscaling works great as well.  My DirecTV honestly never looked so good as it does now.  Remote, nice.  Easy to use.  Love the touch pad.  Has a lighting feature so remote buttons light up in the dark.  Comes in handy.  Controls my DVR as well.  No lag issues.  Snappy Web browser.  Voice control nice.  Gaming-excellent.OTHER COMPARISONS:Before I finally bought the Samsung's.  I went through a nightmare trying to find a good TV.  Thank goodness Amazon returns are easy and nearly hassle free!  After reading many reviews and forums, and going on prior experience with my older LG,  I had purchased the LG 55\" LA7400 first.  Not only would I save a little money, but I would also get a nice TV with all the bells and whistles, or so I thought.  I also made the choice to buy the 47\" inch version of this TV for the bedroom as well.  Both arrived quickly from Amazon.  Packaging Great.  Set up, fairly easy.  TV -beautiful.  Here is where the joy quickly faded.Plugged the LG 55\" TV in, powered on.  Immediately noticed 2 red stuck pixels on the screen and some clouding in upper right and lower left sides of the TV.  There was also a little clouding mid-screen.  Very distracting to say the least.  Once past setup, I noticed some banding on picture.  Unacceptable!  It became very obvious rather quickly that LG's quality control department failed with this TV.  I had read about the lighting issues and uniformity issues on the forums, but it was pretty much hit or miss with some people.  Not every TV is perfect because some flaws are considered \"acceptable\" from the manufacture.  But this,  this was ridiculously bad.  I immediately scheduled a return with Amazon.  Next, came the 47\" inch set up.  As soon as it powered on,  the lower left corner of the TV had an estimated 100+ of black and white pixels going jagged and horizontal across the screen.  Another failure of LG's quality control.  The packaging was perfect, no damage.  It certainly was not Amazon nor the shipper's fault.  Again, another return.Frustrated and thinking I just had bad luck,  I went to BestBuy.  Looked at the floor model.  It appeared to have some clouding though minimal.  I went ahead and made a purchase anyway of an unopened box 55LA7400.  Got it home, set it up, powered on.  Again, 4 red stuck pixels on the screen, and some pinkish hue to only the right side of the screen.  Commence to banging my head on the wall in frustration.  TV returned.  Before returning, I did play around with the TV.  Calibration is somewhat ok out of box.  True Calibration not the easiest.  Their calibration tool will make it easier but still feels a little off in colors.  Picture was smooth, although I noticed some pixelation around the mouths of actors on TV.  No matter what I did, I couldn't get rid of this.  Colors tend to push to much yellow almost to the point of making some things appear greenish.  Watched MasterChef and the eggs on the show, the yolks appeared nearly green not yellow.  I tried many calibrations from CNET and AVS, none worked to correct issue.  Apps are not as snappy to load as other TV's though the interface is nice and responsive.  Remote is point and click which is a nice feature but will require a little patience for those not used to this sort of thing.  The magic remote is small, and comfortable in hand.  LG's app store is lacking in my opinion.  Many of their apps will cost you $.  This is not the case with Samsung which nearly all are free and there is no shortage in apps (see the last part of this review).  The LG does have the Amazon App now.  Lag is noticeable especially with gaming.  Gaming is horrible on this model and not recommended if you play any FPS games. My husband couldn't stand it.  Vizio did great in the gaming category and the Samsung surpassed both with gaming.  Sound quality of the LG was great.  This is the one thing I can give compliments to LG for.  Impressive sound.The LG processor lacks the power it needs especially when watching movies from VUDU in 3D.  You will have constant buffering.  LG also lacks enough memory in my opinion leading to even more issues with buffering.  I contacted VUDU and they are saying it's a compatibility issue with the HDX 3D and this LG model.  Normal 720p HD 3D through Vudu will play just fine with no buffering or minimal buffering.  I have a 50mbps connection, so this was not the issue.  If you get this TV, test a free demo of a 3D movie such as TRON or Tangled through VUDU in HDX and you see what I am talking about.  Vizio could play these with no issues and the Samsung even better with ZERO buffering.Next I bought a Vizio 60 M601D TV to save money and based on reviews, seemed to be a good TV although lacking in Apps.  TV, nice, slim but not nearly as thin as most.  Heavier for sure.  Apps are widget based, not pleasing to the eye and Amazon Instant is a huge failure on the Vizio.  3D was great.  Overall picture on par with LG, with a tad bit more graininess although not to noticeable.  No power buttons on back.  TV froze and locked up when accessing YouTube or Yahoo.  Only solution was to unplug from wall because when it froze remote became unresponsive.  There is a lot of uniformity issues with lighting due to the smart dimming feature.  You need this on to get the best and deepest blacks and true cinema while watching a movie.  However,  you get bad flash-lighting and uniformity issues along the sides of the tv, most noticeable in dark scenes with bright areas or end credits.  Blacks feel crushed- especially in dark scenes in the last Harry Potter movie.  TV returned.  Vizio admitted they were aware of issue.Bottom line,  if you are looking for a great 3D tv with the perfect balance of quality, picture, and apps. Go with the Samsung.  Yes you will pay more, but you can actually see where your investment is.  If you want to save a little money, the LG is a good choice if you can get past some of the issues and if you get lucky enough to get a good tv.  As stated, my previous TV was an LG and I was quite happy with it for several years.  I just personally feel quality control is severely lacking now with LG.  Buying a TV shouldn't feel like you are playing the lottery to get a winner.  It's your money, you deserve a good TV with out issues or having to go through 5  TV's (mostly LG's)  like I did, just to get a good one!", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "The sweet spot and the value.", "Author": "Mixman", "ReviewID": "R5ICRG2CWSX0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a great deal of reasearch this was our choice. It is undoubtedly the value and sweet spot. Not against other brands but also within Samsung's current lineup. No problems and updates have improved overall functions. Sharp, clear, many under the hood adjustments if you like. Sound is acceptable for general use. Of course if you are a movie watcher you'll benefit from an outboard system as the build-in is by no means capable of delivering any heavy bass sound. If you had a subwoofer laying around you may be happy with only this addition. I'd suggest refining the picture by learning the internal adjustments, but be warned, like any TV of this nature, a task requiring some study and experimenting. If mounted on the wall the sound will be better as it will reflect. Again, as with most TV's of flat design, the speakers need to be reflected forward. I made some small clear plastic reflectors and taped them on the back, made a good difference in clarity. Not a drawback, just a reality of current methods of design, Samsung being only one of many. The voice control and motion control is a gimmick in my opinion. Have you done voice control with your computer? Are you still using it? I didn't think so. Disability voice control may be more rational but you still must be able to push the microphone button all the time, so could you do this with your specific disability? And the motion control? Yaaa, you probably won't use it. For internet use, a hard-wire is a must, no no no use the wireless. The wireless will work, but you'll eventually realize you should have listened and plugged in direct to you modem/router. I recommend the Samsung video camera which is sold for it. Though it seems expensive at about $70, it is very clear, sound is clean, and the field of view is wide. And, if you intend to surf the web or do much online you WILL need the keyboard. It's a bit spendy too, but after you try screwing around in an attempt to save a dollar connecting all your old boards, you'll realize you need to order the Samsung keyboard. I recommend ordering all the accesories at the start and figure it into your purchase. Get it over with and enjoy your smart TV. Buy this and all the stuff, you'll be happy as one can get unless your budget is unlimited to buy the absolute top-end.UPDATE 1/3/13  TV still works great. Another Samsung update smoothed operation such as hand-written number input on remote. The ONLY complaint is with the remote control unit itself. The design has proven to be difficult to hold onto secondary to the rounded smooth shape. Often due to this shape and mishandling the audio mute is inadvertently engaged. We used some self adhesive pad to provide a more positive grip and the problems of mishandling all but disappeared. The track-pad input works but is more of a hinderance than a help. A tried-and-true simple button input with numbers would be a more friendly input method. A programable buttoned remote may be a good idea. Also, the TV always returns to channel 1 when using the guide. To explain, say you are on channel 155 and you select the guide. You do not go to a channel selection near 155, it always returns to 1, forcing you to scroll the entire spectrum. That said, if you hold the channel button down it will move through a hundred channels within seconds. So though and irritant, it is not a major issue. However, given many set-top box remotes operate the guide in a different manner it would've been nice if the dedicated remote operated the same. Skype, very nice. Movies online are fine so long as you have a hard connection fast enough and stable enough. This is hard to judge as computer speed tests do not tell the whole story. The audio power is insufficient to support a low frequency (bass) and the speakers will audibly clatter (clip) indicating the system is failing. But we all know if you want great full sound for movies you'll need to invest in a system to suit your demands.

It is capable of producing an outstanding picture, and the sound is decent.While the picture is granularly adjustable and customizable, the corners produce noticeable flashlighting. Fortunately, the flashlighting is noticeable primarily when watching a Blu-ray movie that has a 2.39:1 aspect ratio because of the black bar above and below the picture. Furthermore, room lighting must be nearly dark to notice this flaw. This is inherent in large edge-lit LED panels. The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion. I'm very impressed with its array of features, but settled on a core subset of features that I typically use while ignoring the others. I use the television primarily for watching television programming and Blu-ray movies, and occasional online content. I am not a gamer, so I cannot comment on pros/cons of this function. The active 3-D is amazing.My complaints are few, but my biggest complaint is the smart remote. I much prefer a traditional remote, so I purchased a Samsung AA59-00558A controller, and discontinued using the remote that was packaged with the television. The television has powered off at random with no notice, and I attribute this to firmware that had regressions in it. This occurred three times in a six-month period, and the first two times happened during the same week. Although unacceptable, I would call this only a minor nuisance.

I thought the picture quality was only ok but after making changes to dynamic and modify from there it's great.  It's like a new car that needs some time to break the engine in.  This tv seems to adjust to the source signal after a week or so and looks better each day.  The apps are either hit or miss. Some work great with no errors or slowness and others constantly buffer and I know it's not my end because I have a very fast internet service.  The main apps such as netflix, hulu, YouTube work great without any problems but I suspect the developers also built them well.  Remote can be used to control virtually any device including a ps4 when viewing movies or apps.  Don't really use the voice recognition because it always seems faster to just manually do it yourself.  I can see the older folks getting upset at the remote as there is always a push to use one main controller and on this it simply cannot all be done as there aren't dedicated buttons for everything.  While you can draw numbers to change the channel there is also an option to choose #s from a virtual on screen remote which may be easier.  I like and use the tv remote sometimes paired with the cable remote but my wife is strictly a cable remote user.  It's more of personal preference.  I saw the models below this 6300/6400 but their picture quality seemed really subpar when comparing to this model and the 7500/8000 models did not seem like a great payout for the huge increase in price as I got this model on sale during Amazons thanksgiving time sale.  It's a nice price point and the advantages in black quality seemed worth it over the lower models.  Also I checked out Sony's 900 and 802a models but the 900 was way up there in price and the 802 seemed to have a black picture problem and very glossy screen finish.  LG was also on the table but I just couldn't find a model with great overall reviews.  Their screen were quite glossy also but the thing that put them on the chopping block was finding out they capture all contents played on the tv from USB devices and report them back to lg.  I'm not sure if this carries over to other devices plugged in but you can simply google it to read the full story.  Not what I need to happen as I display photos and family content on my tv.

The TV arrived as scheduled, however the box was missing the screws needed to attach the TV to the stand.I immediately called Samsung and the guy basically told me they had to be in the box and I just must not be seeing them. I did an internet search for the size of screw needed to see if I could pick one up at a local store since I wanted to use the TV right away, and the first several hits were all people complaining about same issue of missing hardware.I was instructed to send them an email with proof of purchase and they would get the needed hardware out to me right away, but to continue looking in the box because they \"have to be there.\" Five days later I get a phone call finally acknowledging receipt of my email, and I was told it would take another seven to fourteen days for me to receive the needed hardware. So apparently when you make a major purchase like this, Samsung doesn't even care enough to expedite delivery of something so minor as eight tiny little screws, even when it's their mistake, so that you can begin enjoying your new product.

Mccarthy", "ReviewID": "R3HN4SF72A58P5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "*Update 12-15-13 *The (second) new tv was delivered yesterday.  This tv has a UH02 panel inside.  The one I returned had a TH01 panel.  I confirmed that the TH01 panel is made by Samsung. I was unable to confirm if the UH02 is a Samsung panel or made by another manufacturer contracted by Samsung.  TH01 is supposed to be a primier panel version.  In any regard, the tv is labeled as being made in Mexico.  This panel has no clouding issues however it does have prevalent backlighting in the lower righthand corner, otherwise a good uniform panel. This UH02 panel is also being used in the lesser priced F6300 F6400 series as well.  So for an extra $1000+ I've gained 240hz and I'm not sure what much else????After the initial setup sequence and download of a software update, I found the picture on this version to be remarkably better than the TH01 version I returned.  The tv picture was almost dead on calibrated out of the box.  The prior tv, I spent 3 days playing with the calibration settings trying to get rid of the white washed out faces and poor picture.  This UH02 version looks so good I've hardley touched the settings. I'm not sure what has changed between those two panel versions and only Samsung would be able to say for sure.  It may only be a panel from a different plant/manufacturer, same comparable specs ect.  From what I have read on the net, all these panels manufactured at this time have one issue or another with these big LCD LED-backlit tv's (75\" here) and it's apparently difficult to get one that has a lot less issues than the others, by any manufacturer.  I watched American Horror Story on netflix (a darkly shot series) in a dark room last night and the only issue was the bright lower right corner.  I'm going to watch the tv tonight after dark again but so far I think I can live with one corner being brighter than the other 3 if that is the only issue.I'm upgrading my rating to a \"3\" now.  The last tv panel was so bad it looked like I was watching movies through cloud cover....clouds that didn't move!! Most viewing on this tv does look fantastic for such a large set.  But for the $$ it should look good all the time no matter which type of viewing that is preferred.*Update 12-11-13 *I went back to Bbuy, Magnolia Center, to discuss the clouding issue with this UN75F7100 75\" tv.  Immediately, two sales personnel, recognized the problem and stated Samsung has a KNOWN DEFECT in thier panels in regard to clouding during dark images in the 7100 series.Watch a dark movie or in between changing input sources you will be able to see the clouding effect on a darkened screen.  My tv has clouds all over it.  I tried also watching \"UnderWorld\" which is another movie with a lot of night scenes and the clouding is prevalent.  Bbuy agreed to return/exchange without question and the salesman told me another guy was in the store last week, same tv, same problem and also went for an exchange....hoping for a cloudless panel. Samsung is selling all thier stock in these tv's knowing that a problem exists.  A known problem that exists in a tv upwards of $4k in my case.  In any regard, I'm hoping that TV #2 that is coming on Saturday is cloudless as I still want a 75\" in my living room.  Otherwise I will be giving up on this tv and exchanging it for a 70\" from another manufacturer or going for the 80\" M series Vizio.  I have now downgraded this TV to a \"1\" since a tv that costs this much should not have this issue, and Samsung knows it.  All you have to do is turn it on to see it...surely they turn them on before they left the factory.*Update*I've been watching this tv for several days now.  The picture out of the box with factory settings was terrible.  I followed the calibration settings noted below and found they needed to be tweaked.WARNING:  There is a lot of LED clouding with TV!  If you watch a movie with a lot of blacks, dark scenes, you will notice a significant amount of white clouding in the blacked out areas.  I did not notice any flashlighting from the corners, just a large amount of clouding spots. I watched \"The Purge\" which had a lot of dark scenes with the actors moving about the house with flashlights for illumination and the picture of this tv was terrible, just about ruined the Blueray movie.  Switching to Foxnews, the tv people where all washed out white in skin color.To lessen the amount of clouding go back to the settings:Backlight 8 (reduce this way down)Contrast  92Brightness  46Sharpness  17I found additional settings on the net that must be adjusted to your preference:Color SpaceRed 58 2 0Green  0 58 9Blue 7 0 54Yellow  48 53 7Cyan  0 54 58Magneta  56 4 45offsetR  20G  24B  24GainR  19G  26B  25RGB1  5 1 -22  2 0 -13  0 0 -14  -2 -3 -35  0 -2 -36  1 1 -47  2 3 08  1 2 09  -1 2 210  0 1 1Between the guy who has settings listed in the first review on this site and the ones I've found you should be able to tweak it to your liking....but it's gonna take you a long time.  This tv is replacing a 55\" XVT553SV Vizio that looks fantastic and had none of these issues!! For a product that costs three times as much you would think Samsung would ship a tv that has decent settings out of the box and without clouding issues!!  ON a good note the TV does have a really nice picture when viewing most shows.  I dialed it in while viewing a muppet movie that was on HBO....lots of colors.  But for the price, this set should not have the clouding issues it does.--------I just bought this TV from BBuy after they price matched Eastcoast tv.  That seller is not on Amazon's match list.  I would not directly buy from ECTv since they are a big come on company with several $$ add ons to get to a price point before they will ship you a tv however my dad bought a Samsung 75\" 8000 series from them w/ no problems, still for much less.  I tried to purchase the 80\" Vizio from Amazon but did not hit the buy button quick enough - 3,298 - and the price was raised four hundred dollars - 3,798 and a call to request the earlier prime price was denied.  I was surprised Amazon turned down the sale of a >$3K tv buts thats thier business.  Hence this purchase elseware.  I went to several stores and viewed the 80\" vizio, all the 80\" sharps, 6300 and 8000 75\" series samsungs.  The 8000 series samsung looked the best followed by any of the samsungs afterwards.  The F7100 was positioned right next to the 80\" top line sharp in a Magnolia section of BB.  The picture quality of the sammy was easily seen to be better.  I am replacing a 55\" vizio smart tv.  If I had not received a great deal on the sammy, I would have bought the 80\" vizio.  If you see a 75\" postitioned right next to an 80\" tv, the 80\" is markedly bigger by comparison (if you have the room for it!).I'm going to update my review of the tv after I have used it for a few weeks with my overall impression, but will give it a 4 star for now and upgrade later depending on it's performance.I have found that finding calibration settings on the net and changing them on a tv makes a world of difference in picture quality and have done it to several tv's.  I noticed another reviewer posted some too.I found the calibration following settings for the F7100 series, all sizes, on LCDbuyingguide.com\"F7100 Calibration Notes: Calibration was very accurate and easy to aquire with the F7100 series LED TV. In fact, it is pretty close to the D6500 color temperature that our calibration shoots for. Also, as we said in the full review, you will want to change the AutoMotion Plus feature depending on the programming you are watching. That is one of the most important things to keep in mind. With most programming you will want to turn it off or at least the De-judder portion. With 3D and Gaming you will benefit from leaving it on.

I'm a pro with Siri, and Bluetooth/voice activated navigation systems in 4 different vehicles that I've owned. But for some reason I'm terrible with this TV.  Not that big of a deal, as I didn't know it had voice control till it arrived, and I'm faster without it.More annoying was the TV speakers rattle sometimes, at low volume, when on surround sound mode. In standard mode they are don't, but sound a little worse. Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that. I have 5.1 in my living room where this tv is, and have 7.2 in a dedicated theater room. The problem is our baby is in the living room with us a lot, falls asleep, and the real surround sound system will wake him. So I've been using the tv speakers even though they are not stellar, but to be fair the tv is only 1.3 inches thick...those two things are just FYI, if either of those are a concern for some buyers.Other than that, just make sure you know what you are buying. This is not a plasma, and one weakness of LCDs is off angle viewing.  In our living room there are off angle seats and you can tell the blacks are not as dark off angle. The picture is still good, just not as great as when you are in front of it. Looks like how far back you are determines how much side to side you can go before it starts to wash out the blacks. I have one of the popular Panasonic plasma tvs from 2012, and it doesn't do this. The trade off though, is my plasma has burn in, and didn't look as good as this tv in a bright living room. I was waiting to review the plasma until I determined whether I could get rid of the espn and abc logos. Oh well college football is worth it...but I will watch it on this LCD now.  Plus I like the look of LCDs in bright rooms. I turned off Eco mode, which would dim the screen based on ambient light. It got brighter of course and I think the picture looks really good. The plasma is good also, just different and might suit different tastes, that's why I say know what you are buying so you can be happy.Finally, flash lighting and other issues some people might care about. My 40in Samsung had some light in the corners when black bars were present for movies. This 65in doesn't seem to be as bad as the 2010 40in, but to be honest I watch movies with black bars elsewhere. If that matters to you and your room is dark, you might consider plasma. I didn't get too into studying the screen uniformity. Baby keeps me too busy...but no dead pixels or obvious flaws that I heard about on 2012 large Samsungs.This TV has a bright colorful picture, and I like it a lot. I also really like not being concerned about burn in, like I am now with my plasma.

Great picture when viewing from straight on.  As with most LED TVs, viewing angles are limited but ALL Samsungs seem to have very limited viewing angles.  Movie mode seems to be the worst as even one seat off center will start to change the color dramatically.  Natural mode seems to improve the angle, but this is something you need to consider when purchasing the TV.  Sony's and LGs seem to have better angled viewing but the 7100 is still a great television, but just look for it when comparing as everyone's setup is different.2. HDMI-CEC (ARC + AnyNet+) - When using HDMI ARC, you MUST enable AnyNet+ which will attempt to control your receiver.  When the TV is powered on, it will also start the receiver.  However, the problem is after the TV allows the receiver to power on, it will ALWAYS send a change source signal to change to the source to TV.  This is great if you want to use the Smart Hub but not if you mostly go straight to your cable box or other device.  You will need to use a universal remote (making sure you disable the powering on from the remote as the TV will do this on it's own) or the receiver remote to change the receiver input back to the correct device.  After this initial issue, the TV will keep the receiver in sync appropriately.  Samsung seems to have had this issue for years and will not make any adjustments for it.  So, if you don't want to have a 2nd remote handy, bypass ARC and use an optical cable for TV audio instead.  That may mean running a different line behind the walls if that is your setup.3. Apps are ok, but not stellar.  I wish they made the smart hub a separate box to allow easier upgrading and connections to your Audio Receiver.  But I am sure people will complain about a separate box as much as I am saying it should be separate.4. Smart Touch remote - ok but a little limited as you may still need to use a second remote.  The guide button seems to always go to the Samsung Guide which will not replace the FiOS guide.  I wish you could reprogram the guide button.  Short of that, simply tap the right side of the touch pad and you will get your STB guide to come up.More to come.  Great TV with some limitations.  Based on some of the limitations, it may be more cost effective to get a cheaper TV as most people will not realize the picture differences anyway.  Remember, if you mainly watch cable or satellite, you are limited to whatever format they broadcast.  So, 1080i and 60Mhz from a cable box may not be able to take advantage of all the bells and whistles.  I would like to give the TV higher but the minor technical issues and limited viewing area require me to take it down a few pegs.  A lot of the reviews are probably based on the initial picture you see and not how you use the device every day.For comparison sake... Sony 550 and LG 7200/7400 seem to be comparable products.

Buying a TV online is a bit risky but the packaging is good enough on this TV for you to go for the online purchase and not worry about getting a TV with a cracked screen.Picture quality: The quality of this TV is great, just what you would expect from a large company like samsung. I tested this TV by playing a blu-ray, a dvd and a videogame. The blu-ray movie I watched was Despicable me, if you have watched this movie before you would know the cute little minions. The first thing I noticed was the color of the minions, the yellow looked brighter than on any TV I saw before, the colors were truly amazing (especially the bright ones). Another thing I noticed was the sharpness of the images whenever I paused the movie, the image that appears when I pause the movie looks like an HD JPEG which is not really the case with other TVs. The dvd I watched on this TV was an episode of Breaking Bad, I did this because I felt that judging the colors of an animated movie wouldn't necessarily be the same as a normal video. It was pretty hard concentrating on the TV when watching the DVD (if you're a breaking bad fan you'd know why) but I did my best to find any flaws. The colors were vibrant and didn't disappoint, there was so much detail in every scene partially due to the massive screen but mainly because the shades of each color are easily distinguishable which is a rare quality in non-samsung TVsSound: the sound produced from this TV was great but I always like to add a subwoofer for additional bass, the TV would still sound great without one but if you are going to invest  a lot of money on this TV then you should invest a little more and have a complete system. The best top-quality, affordable subwoofer out there is the Polk Audio PSW10 it sells for around $105 on amazon, there is also the Yamaha YST-SW012 which sells around $90. Both subwoofers are top quality, I've tested both of them and they will not disappoint if you decide to go ahead with the purchase.Gaming: This TV is every gamers dream. I played just dance 4 with my playstation move (PS version of kinect) on it and I didn't want to leave, I was playing multiplayer with my brother and the screen was split in half but the screen was still large enough. When playing black ops I could spot the snipers with an SMG all the way across the map (couldn't have done this with my vizio). When I played fifa 13 I could spot players easier and everything looked fresh, the grass on the field looked greener and the graphics of the game looked better than on my 32 vizio.Special features: I honestly never use the special features on this TV, why would anyone use the built in microphone to get TV recommendations when it can be done manually a lot faster, it's kinda like Siri, it's fun at first but doesn't work all the time.Design: This is the Gallardo of all TVs, it looks great on any wall or stand. I wouldn't mind buying a non-working TV and sticking it on a random wall in my house, its really slim and has a modern look.Overall: don't hesitate buying this TV, you won't regret it, if you want to be 100% satisfied buy a subwoofer with it preferably a Yamaha or a Polk and you're set.I tried to cover everything, but feel free to ask if you have any questions :)", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture Quality.", "Author": "URCME \"urcme\"", "ReviewID": "R2UQJYOJSGMOSS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "75 inch LED has a breath taking superb pure color picture image.

Netflix is very fast and Amazon Instant Video is slightly slower but it but not enough to say it's a slug. The quality is so good waiting 3 extra seconds for it to boot is well worth the wait.

So my guess is anyone that says their Samsung Smart Hub is slow could be having connect issues?TL-Link  TL-SG1008D Switch  purchased here in Amazon. Runs  very cool and is a electricity  miser five minute hook upTP-Link  TL-WDR4300 Router  purchased here in Amazon  Runs  very cool and is a electricity  miser. The router extended my WIFI to every part of the house including the garage  giving me 5 bars. And fifty foot outside before loss of signal. Ten minute hook up. See  my reviews under URCMEThe TV  sound is fair but not spectacular, so I have my Samsung Sound Bar plugged into the digital outlet that Samsung provides giving the TV outstanding  sound.  Out of the box the picture image is not so good. Since it defaults to \" standard \" and not  \" dynamic \" where I have it set for the absolute best possible resolution. The TV will remember what \" source \" you left it in when turning it back on.  Getting used to the \" touch remote \" was easy, after one day I was starting to get the hang of it. It's so small that and rests comfortably on my arm chair where I watch TV from. The TV runs a little on the warm side, you can feel the heat emanating off the screen up to one foot evenly covering the complete surface, and it varies on the perimeter of the frame from warm to cool, which slightly increases my living room temp by 1 or 2 degrees which is ok in the winter.  Getting back to the Smart Hub. As mentioned the apps open very quickly and the Browser is slow compared to my computer. The reason it's slow is  because the factory has it set the Browser App to \" MSN News \" with a lot of active flash programs that need to finish down-loading. So I typed in \" Google \" and it opened just as fast as my computer. Then I went into setting and made set it to default. So now when I log-on it's instantaneous and I can find anything I want. The Browser is capable of playing  \" movies of any type that uses Adobe Flash such as ESPN video's music \" and so forth.  I'm having a slight issue with Netflix and Amazon, during the Streaming Process. When I had the TV hard wired I noticed while watching a filmed  Super HD movie, not an \"upgrade super hd movie\"  I was getting \" skips \" after ten words the voice would blank out one word then continue. I had the feeling the TV's processor was having a hard time keeping up the flow of information. Then I considered it could be the software? The same problem was found on the Amazon App in the Smart Hub but not as bad. But only on some movies. While other that were filmed in Super High HD did not \" skip \" so I experimented and switched my Ethernet Hard Wire to WIFI and most of  problem went away, but it still skips.  To be certain that I was not fault I changed from the Smart Hub to my \" Sony BDPS-790 3D Blu-ray Player with Wi-Fi \" that was streaming both NetFlix and Amazon Instant  before I bought the Samsung TV, and the \" skipping disappeared \" To further prove the Smart Hub NetFlix and Amazon Instant Apps were \" skipping \" I changed the TV source to my backup \" Apple TV MD199LL/A [NEWEST VERSION] with Mini Tool Box \" and the \" skipping was not present \" So come Monday I will call Samsung and find out what I'm doing wrong. Since no one else has mentioned  \" skipping problems \" here in the Amazon Reviews I must surmise that issue is limited to me only. So don't use this as a reason not to buy this TV. I will update this review in  a few days. The movie I was watching were the \" skipping \" was present is  \" Oylmpus Has Fallen \"  Finally the side viewing dose diminish some the greater the angle but it's still very viewable up to 45%, better than the 80inch Vizio I replaced. Update 11-29-13,  after viewing TV through the Samsung Smart Hub, both Netflix & Amazon Instant Video, I discovered a annoying flaw in the picture format capability. You are not able to expand the picture vertically or horizontally. Meaning if the picture your watching is in 4.3 format having vertical borders on both side or in  a \" wide format \" having horizontal borders on top and bottom you can't change it. It's only in the TV mode can you adjust the TV format and even that is limited. The standard 16.9 format leaves you vulnerable. For me every TV I have ever owned in the last 15 yrs was capable of adjusting the format to get a full picture regardless of what mode the TV was in. This will take time getting used too. I'm not happy. Once again the picture is just AWESOME so I live on.  Buyers beware when buying this TV. I paid $3799.00 delivered curb side, the best deal I could find. After reading the contents I knew for a fact they all came with the Keyboard, but I was mistaken, mine did not come with a keyboard. That's why I got a good deal. The factory offers these TV's minus the Keyboard to online dealers for fast sales. So be sure you ask this question dose it come with the Wireless Keyboard. They cost $89.00 here in Amazon.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid HDTV hardware, but software is Not So Smart & very buggy", "Author": "Smart Consumer", "ReviewID": "R11CU11QEU3TSE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "No complaint about HDTV hardware - impressively thin & very slim bezel.Not compatible w/ a slimline portable Samsung Blu-Ray drive I bought for my PC months earlier.

I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful.  This TV is an LED TV, but don't let that confuse you.  LED is similar to LCD, LED basically means that the TV is back-lit better and in turn makes sure their are no dark spots on the screen.  Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step you need to look at is what features come with the TV.  Here are a few that come with this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.This Samsung also has Smart Hub organizes your entertainment and content into 5 convenient panels: On TV, Movies and TV Shows, Social, Apps, and a panel for your Photos, Videos and Music.To add this Samsung has a Dual Core Processor that allow you to perform multiple tasks at the same time. It also enables fast web browsing while playing apps or TV programs that you've recently opened through the Recent History feature.The next thing is in box technology:With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "As good as my 6 year old Samsung Plasma.. pretty much.", "Author": "John P.", "ReviewID": "RX2HROTDGD7FZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a larger screen so I upgraded from my 58\" Samsung plasma to this 75\" Samsung 7100. My plasma set had some bad capacittors that I have already repaired once and picture is going out again. It was long in the tooth at 6+ years old so I figured it was time to move up a size. I am happy OVERALL with the set because it really does have the best picture from an LCD of this size I have seen under $9,000. I honestly have to say that if you can live with 65\" or smaller, GET A PLASMA!!! and keep $2,000 in your wallet. No you won't be \"fashionable\" with a tiny bezel like this TV; and no it won't be as thin as a piece of toast, but it will do what a TV is suppossed to do.... display an awesome picture. Like I said, I do like this TV and the smart apps seem pretty cool although I have a full time Media PC hooked up already so I can't see it replacing that anytime soon. To get to the big sizes (70\" and up) you need an LCD so that is what I did. I also have to get used to the color differences between plasma and LCD sets so that is part of it. I have been watching it for 2+ hrs a day for 2 weeks now so I am used to it but my wife and I have the same opinion... \"Real nice, and huge, but no better color or picture than our old plasma\". I know this sounds like a negative review but it is not. I am just being subjective and I know 90% of people out there have a living room where 65\" or less is more than enough. I have a freind with the 80\" top of the line Sharp \"857\" model and this is a better picture so trust me that extra 5\" is not worth it, get the Samsung.Now some observations..... When on a totally black screen there is what I guess they call \"clouding\" near the 4 corners but mainly the left side top and bottom. It is distinctive,each spot is different that the others and does not change. You only notice it when the picture is black so I guess I can live with it since it can't be seen during normal picture, just when credits roll, etc. But once again this is actuall pretty normal with LCD's and plasmas never have this.Also when there is a guy in the dark with a flashlight (say on CSI or something) you will sometimes see the gradual stepdown grey shades of shadow of that light. I see this on all LCD's, almost never on a plasma. The technologies are different there are inherent problems with both, for instance plasmas buzz sometimes, they get hotter, and use way more power. Also this 75\" weighs ~62lbs off the stand but my 58\" plasma was about 95 lbs. but felt like 200 while leaning over my mantle. :-)P.S. The remote has no number keys, it is real small and has a neat trackpad and voice control mic with a few key buttons for menu, smart hub, etc.. I was thrown off at first but I now like it.The TV has wireless but the worst thing you can do over wireless is try to stream video so remember that. I have already run 2 ethernet wires for my DirecTV and Media PC but I plan to do another one for the TV since it often loses connection with the wireless N router that is about 20' away.This TV has the dual core processor vs. the 4 core in the 8000/9000 series models. The apps seem to load just fine with the dual core so that should'nt be a deal breaker for anyone.3D is viewed through 4 included active glasses that sync with the TV when turned on. I have looked at 2 3D videos from different sources and even the built in 3D sample videos that come stored in the TV. The 3D effect does work pretty well but I honestly have to say that there is a latent \"outline shadow\" on both sides of high contrast objects. For instance the white striped center lines on the Lemans racing track (Samsung video) have extra outline shadows on either side of them that you can see on the black street. This effect appears in ALL 3D content and all 4 pairs of glasses, so it is the TV not the source.  It is minor but definitly noticable enough to turn me off on 3D more than I already was. I hope this helps some people with buying decisions, like I said this is a great TV and can't be beat for the money apples to apples. I wanted to offer something other that the usual reviews that either consist of GREATEST TV EVA!!! or a highly technical scientific grading of color, hue, dynamic contrast ratio, blah, blah, blah that even leave me puzzled.... and I went to electronic school.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN60F7100 Has Amazing Picture Qaulity", "Author": "William M.

The picture fills almost the entire span of the TV with only a very thin bevel around the edges, adding to the experience.  The remote is very small with only a few buttons and not sure we would like it as the prime remote, but use a universal for basic functions and controlling the associated cable box.  in terms of controlling the unique features of the TV such as browser, apps and settings, the remote is great.  It is a bit cumbersome controlling Netflix functions, so prefer to use Netflix from the Blu-Ray player.  The 3D glasses that come with the TV do not provide consistent operation, however.  It is difficult to pair them to the TV and have not been able to get more than 3 working at the same time.

Nice 240 Hz refresh rate. Vivid colors. Deep blacks and reds. Setup was easy, but adjusting the picture settings can be challenging. I purchased this TV to replace my older Samsung Un46D6000, which in reality is not that old. I have the 7100 set up primarily  for watching movies. However, I had the benefit of the doubt via another buyer of the Ub46F7100 for adjusting the settings. II followed his review on the setup portion of the picture. However, I can say that the picture still needs some tweaking. The remote is very intuitive, but I still have problems with the IR sensor that supposedly replaces all your other remote control devices. The Voice Command feature on this TV is also a nice addition, but I would say it is not absolutely necessary. The remote overall is very nice. The Smart Hub and Web browsing aspect of this TV are also  very nice and easy to use. If I have a complaint about this TV it is the slight fogging in the picture I see when my lights are turned off. This, again, might be the fact that the TV needs some more adjusting. The 3D portion of this TV is also a nice touch. I have this TV set up in my bedroom and I played Clash of the Titans in 3D and I give this aspect of the TV mixed reviews. The 3D viewing is pretty good. You have to be sitting a minimum of 6ft  from the Tv for optimal viewing. The 3D special effects weren't what I call overwhelming though. Samsung includes 4x3d active glasses with batteries. That is a nice touch. Another critique of this TV is the side or angle viewing which in my opinion is nominal at best. If you are going to use this TV for primarily watching movies or 3D content,  I would recommend at a minimum the 55\" or 60\" screens. Again, this TV is setup in my bedroom so  a screen larger than 46\" is somewhat impractical for me. Overall though, I like this TV. I especially liked the price. The UN46F7500 I am sure is a nicer TV, but I could not justify paying another $400 minimum for a TV the same size that has a few more options available.

(some-what in depth)", "Author": "Jaime Maldonado", "ReviewID": "R2WRZC4NSH3ARS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have purchased this TV a month ago and I can say I am very happy with it. I purchased it with much consideration and scrutiny (like any other man who wants to buy a big TV for the money they put in it.) The background I came from in the TV world are Plasma TVs. As you may, or may not know, they offer the best natural colors and have a true, deep black tone. I have had 2 plasma TVs, one that I was very happy with and another that I was very disappointed with. To speak of the first one I owned, it was a Samsung Plasma TV from 2009. I had that for 3 years and then was able to finally upgrade to another TV. My brother has it now and its still going strong aside from it tilting slightly, yet noticeable, on its original stand. The second purchase was a Panasonic P50GT50 smart TV earlier this year (2013). I had that TV for about 7 months. Needless to say, its the Panasonic that I purchased that was a terrible buy and I am glad they bought it off my hands back.Now, stating that background, I am happy with the screen this TV produces. As you read around about LEDs, they don't produce the best color depths that are natural. I would have to say that with this TV, the change is seamless to me and I have yet to do any real adjustments with the screens. Though some would have their adjustments, it all depends on where you live. My TV is in a dark area and I feel it produces great image for where it is located with its auto lighting adjustment.Speaking of the audio system. First off, you bought a TV, not a sound system. If anyone ever tries to 'review' an audio system (whether by CNET or a 'professional') you should stop reading that section and move on to the next, its always a waste of time. I bought a Samsung 550 soundbar. Soundbars in general are the way to go, in my opinion, unless you have the money to fork out for a REAL 5.1 or 7.1 system. I am very happy with it, especially the fact that it connects to my TV's remote via Samsung's 'Anynet' connection. Learn it, like it, love it!The physical appearance of the TV is very attractive for any setting. Considering the bezel was made thin, it is hardily noticeable, whether watching the TV or not. Now, because the TV is so tall, I suggest bracing it to the wall or wall mounting it or mounting it to an actual entertainment center. You don't want to swivel it and then.... well its 60\" and that's a bit tall to swivel at a small low point if you ask me.. So get some sense, brace it or mount it. I mounted it to the entertainment center. Its very easy to manage in terms of weight. I would say though that if you get something this big, a 60\", I would suggest to have 2 people to carry it due to its size. You might be able to manage a 50\" or under on your own... but I would never suggest that..The smart interface on this model is excellent! Though I have yet to do some of the 'more advance' functions such as screen sharing, the applications on the smarthub and the more 'simple' apps such as youtube and amazon prime are simple to use. I love personally how there is a selection square around what app or function you hover over and it indicates as well via sound. Panasonic's smart interface was less then desirable in lacking a selection square in the model previously mentioned, thats why I am pointing this out.Now, speaking so highly of a TV, why 4-stars for this TV. Well, the TV is a great TV, but I feel there is some lacking to it in the WiFi/streaming connection side. I wish I could post the pictures, but the TV, while obtaining a ping of 71 and 55 for a 2.4G and a 5G connection, only has a download speed of 2.49 and 3.32, again respectively. I have a connection of 30MB with cable connections, a very good, strong connection from an ASUS N66u Dual band router. Now, before you say \"make a bridge stupid' I already tried. Not only that, it actually got worse, a ping between 1000-1200 and a download of 1MB. So yeah, there. And it was another Asus Dual Band router I used for it. So it actually got worse so now I reverted back to the built-in WiFi connection and put it on the 5G band. A little rough with some movies, but for the most part, it still manages to stream HD. I think Samsung should still look into this. I have no idea whats going on that's wrong.To wrap up, that TV is excellent if you are looking for great image and an overall system that literally allows you to control everything with a small remote (so awesome). However, due to the fact that it has some kind of streaming cap to the TV, it almost kills the 'smart function' making you seek other options. If it frustrates me enough, I turn on my PS3 and go from there. I just shouldn't have to go there to get smooth smart applications. I did pay for a smart TV!Well that's my two cents!

The preset settings for \"Movie\" are just fine.- 3D: We are watching quite a bit of 3D content, both from DirecTV and from a Samsung BD-F7500 BluRay player. The 3D picture is excellent. We are viewing the picture from about 10-12 ft away, and the effects are awesome, especially when the picture \"jumps out\" at you! We have had guests tell us that the 3D picture is much better than that of other friend's TVs.- Apps: We are using mainly the Netflix and Amazon Instant Video apps. The response time is very good, even with the dual core processor. The TV easily connected to our WiFi. We have a 25 Mbps Internet connection, and only a Wireless G router (54 Mbps) on the LAN side, and we have not had any problems streaming video. In fact, the TV seems to buffer the video streams much better than the old Roku player that we were using. The Roku tended to have to rebuffer the video quite often, and also dropped the picture quality from HD to SD due to bandwidth limitations at the provider. We haven't noticed any of those problems with this TV.- Anynet: We LOVE this feature. We are able to stream video from our PCs (which are running Serviio), and from my wife's Kindle. I am even streaming some old Divx movies which I have stored on my PC, some of which are less than 380 resolution, and they still look very good on the TV! I should also mention that my wife has a Samsung camera, and it easily connected via Anynet to the TV, so we can view pictures. This should work with any WiFi enabled camera that is running compatible file sharing software.- The unit is seamlessly compatible with my Samsung BD-F7500 BluRay player. I can control the major functions of both the BluRay or the TV from either of the remotes. Also, the TV remote will control my DirecTV satellite HD DVR, but only for power on/off. That is fine, as I don't expect the TV remote to be universal.- Another nice feature is that during setup, the TV queries you on the type of receiver you have (Satellite, Cable, etc), and your service provider name. This allows the TV to customize its viewing Guide in the Apps section, and also allows the remote to turn on/off your set-top box.Cons:- The 3D glasses that are supplied with the TV use un-rechargeable store bought batteries, and which don't have a long life. Also, the lenses are quite small. We bought a set of \"3 Active\" premium 3D glasses from Dimensional Optics. They have a larger lens, and also have built-in rechargeable batteries (USB). These are much better than the glasses Samsung provided. It is worth the $50 each. Since the 3D glasses are add-ons, this doesn't bother me too much.- The remote touch pad takes some getting used to. My major complaint is that in order to pause or stop a movie that you are streaming through the TV Apps, you have to click the \"More\" button on the remote, which brings up a \"virtual remote\" icon on the screen, which you then have to navigate through to find the Pause and Stop buttons. This is a bit cumbersome at first, especially if someone is at the door and you want to pause the movie quickly! After I got used to it, though, I found that I can go through the procedure quickly. It would be nice, though, to have these buttons on the remote.- The printed user manual is a bit skimpy. It refers you to the \"E-Manual\", which is accessible on the TV, or which you can download as a PDF through Samsung's website. I appreciate the intent of saving paper, but a complete printed user manual would have been nice. Again, a very minor thing.- The TV sound is not the best, but I have heard worse from similar sized TVs. We have found the sound to be adequate for general viewing. When we are streaming a movie or watching a BluRay, we always switch over to 5.1 Surround Sound through an external A.V amp, and it sounds excellent!I've read some of the reviews regarding screen failure after 1 year. I really hope that our TV doesn't suffer the same fate. We didn't buy the extended warranty. So far, the quality control of the unit seems very good. I also have not noticed any problems with the screen during early life that other users have complained about, and that they claim required a \"burn-in\" period.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Television", "Author": "P.

A sound bar or additional speakers may be in order for some.The touch pad remote control works pretty well - although the lack of many buttons makes some changes more difficult to do.So I also bought the Samsung Smart TV Remote  (model BN59-01054A) - which is particularly well made, has back lighting, and easy to use large, flat buttons that all readily work with this set.

I contacted the Amazon seller and was told if it wasn't damaged during shipping, I needed to contact Samsung for a resolution. As you can guess, this has been a nightmare to resolve.

Did some additional research and Samsung always stood out.Ordered the set from Amazon. That in itself was a very rewarding experience; I spoke with an order agent and he answered every question I could come up with  It made me realize how much experience Amazon has with this type of product and service.The delivery company contacted me within a week. We agreed on a delivery date and they agreed to deliver it in the morning. At 9:05 they arrived. By 9:20 the TV was set up and on the first of its set-up screens. The delivery guys could not have been more professional and helpful. My obligation is to keep the packing box for 30 days in case a problem arises. If it does they come back, repack it and send it back to Amazon. Nifty.My part of the TV set-up took 15 minutes - including times for a 6 minute software update and establishing my wifi connection. The HDMI to cable box connection assures a great out of the box picture. You can spend time fiddling with all the picture adjustments that are available but we decided to leave the picture alone. It is simply outstanding. Outdoor sporting events probably look best on the Dynamic option and standard TV probably looks best on Standard mode. It takes seconds to jump from one to the other.  Watching reclaimed old black and white movies is a remarkable experience. Like not having seen them before.Once the wifi connection is made you have access to the entire internet and a wealth of already established connections appear - including Netflix, You tube, HULU etc. I quickly realized that the smart TV does away with the needed for a Roku device, so I have moved that to our bedroom TV. The small TV controller is a touch pad which takes a bit of practice (at least for me). Once I got the hang of it, exploring all the viewing options will almost overwhelms you. The process is intuitive and with just a bit of playing around you will learn to maneuver from option to option.I am an amateur photographer an inserted a thumb drive with a bunch of pictures. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the photos appeared. The hi-def photos show well on a large hi-def TV. This is where some playing with the picture mode and color/tint options may come into play.A glance at the TV's specs will show you that there are plenty of connections available. With 4 HDMI inputs and all sorts of USB drive options you can watch an endless stream of video.The sound quality is very good. Admittedly not as good as my Onkyo surround sound system. I plan to undertake setting that up once my Samsung BluRay player arrives later this week.Frankly, I never thought I would spend close to $3,000 on a TV but I am not at all regretting it.

This review will focus on a few incidental items that you may interesting.The base is rugged and swivels about 30 degrees to each side. Nice!The remote, as reviewed by others, take some getting used to but it pretty good. They say it is a universal remotes as it will control other devices but, in my case, not completely. For example it adjusts the volume on my LG sound bar bit will not control other options on the bar. There is a pop-up remote from a button-push that then acts like a normal remote with the ability to enter numbers and select frequently used items. I suppose it saves clutter on the hand-held.The smart function, apps or channels, works pretty well but not as well or as with as many channels as my ROKU 2XS device which I have connected and  which I use must of the time. The Samsung does have a YouTube channel which works very well.The 3D is super! Better in a darkened room.Batteries seem to last a reasonable time but you can buy rechargeable glasses for about $50 from other Internet sources.The USB ports provide both .5 and 1 amp and will drive a USB 2 or 3 external hard drive. I have my movies converted to MP4 files and they are displayed nicely and show great on the TV. Each title is displayed in a box with moving pictures taken from the movie.Free shipping from Amazon arrived 1 day late and Amazon compensated me for the delay. Thank you, Amazon. Very nice. The driver helped me unpack the TV, install the stand, connect my devices and turned it on to make sure everything worked to my satisfaction. The driver offered to remove that packing material but I declined - just in case.Easy setup and connection to WiFi. The set immediately went on line and got a software update. There is online help from Samsung where they can actually control your TV. Don't know how that works as I haven't had need to try it.Other items like voice recognition for control of the TV do work and may be more than just a gimmick as you may think. For example, when watching an MP4 movie from the USB port, pushing the talk button and saying \"Pause\" will do just that. Other voice commands are available. You can also control the USB movie from the pop-up on-screen remote.Motion control, face recognition, with a camera (not supplied with the F7100) were not tested. i probably will never use them.Giving the 7100 4 and 3/4 stars may be a bit harsh.

Wills", "ReviewID": "R30DXRQ9SRH55V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I watched this 65\" TV at the showroom of a major appliance store (one of the last chains, blue and yellow logo) and was very impressed with the picture. The offsetting factor was the price, however. The price came down to two grand and I thought that I should take the plunge - it's a want not a need, right?The TV arrives with a (somewhat flimsy) stand, 4 sets of 3d glasses, a remote and batteries. Setup is quite easy; you assemble the stand parts (2) with 4 *very tiny* screws, and then attach the stand to the TV with yet another 4 of the same screws. The stand allows the TV to rotate about 30 degrees or so, but there is a significant amount of flex and the TV appears to be top heavy. If you are going to use the stand (I don't recommend this) then be sure to anchor your TV to the wall or cabinet so that it doesn't come crashing down and ruin your $2k investment.Other reviewers have had issue with the remote. It's a bit unusual - it has a touch interface similar to a laptop mouse pad. You swipe your finger across it to navigate the various menus and features. There is also a button titled \"more\" which allows you to access an on-screen numeric keypad if you want to select your channels directly. I ended up getting used to the remote - it's different but not hard to adapt to. Others have stated that you can get a standard Samsung remote, but I chose not to bother.When you first start the TV it walks you through a roughly 1 hour setup process - downloading updates, getting wireless info, and other relevant information. The updates go very slowly. I don't know, but I can imagine there must be quite a few updates to process. Overall, once it starts updating you can go out and get dinner - it will be done by the time you get back.The TV itself: The picture looks awesome! The thin bezel design makes it look like the picture is floating in midair. Very sharp picture out of the box, and minimal tweaking of the picture is required. Be sure to run your TV for 15 hours or so before really messing with the settings - that gives your panel time to \"set in\". The user menus are pretty intuitive, and I see very little need to mess with many of the settings since the defaults appear to be sufficient for most people.Did I mention I *love* the picture?3D: I consider 3D TV a gimmick and a waste of time. Truthfully, I bought this TV fully intending never to use it. However, I wanted the thin bezel, the better LED/LCD panel, and dual core processor - that means 3D had to come along for the ride! I did, however, decide I would try out the 3D \"just once\" with the movie \"Gravity\". All I can say is... WOW. The 3D is positively AMAZING. The starfield images jump out at you, objects float out of the TV, and best of all, my eyes weren't fatigued by the end of the movie. The experience made me rethink my former disdain for 3D TV. A few annoyances: The 3D glasses don't pair up with the TV unless you are standing directly in front of the TV.  Also, the glasses tend to eat coin cells. Be sure to get a bunch of them at Costco or something if you are going to watch a lot of 3D TV.Streaming video: I have Amazon Prime (surprise surprise!) on an AT&T; U Verse connection, and movies stream wirelessly to this TV with no buffering or stuttering. I am very pleased with the performance of this TV over a wireless connection. There is a LAN port on the back if you don't wish to use the wireless connection. I haven't tested it, but I am reasonably certain that it would work just fine. :)I have gushed about how good the picture is, now here are my nit picking things about the TV:- Sleep function is buried 2 menus deep. The \"tools\" menu doesn't work when you are in the Smart Hub or streaming movies.- Samsung apps (like NFL for instance) can't be deleted. I think that if I don't want an app, I should be able to de-install it. Why do they get to hog my TV's resources for garbage like Shopping Apps and other useless junk? You'll spend some time throwing away a bunch of worthless apps once you find out that they want you to pay through the nose to watch 1970s sitcoms on them.- Apps can't be reorganized. I use Amazon Prime. I do not use Hulu Plus/Netflix/Blockbuster (?). I don't want Hulu Plus on my apps screen since I don't use it and I don't want it front and center. Too bad the TV will not allow me to do this.- The \"Updates\" function takes a while to initialize.- When connecting wirelessly, there is a 40 second or so \"lag\" before a connection is established. No big deal but it is a bit annoying.-Slight white clouding on the lower left hand if the screen, visible only when the image is perfectly black. It doesn't intrude any other time.- The built in speakers S. U. C. K.!  But... what do you expect from a TV this thin?!? I am reasonably certain you'll be getting a soundbar.Overall, this is a gorgeous TV and I am very happy with my purchase.

The picture is amazingly clear and perfect on the HD channels. The other channels not so much. I don't think it's the TV but the network. The TV is very easy to navigate with the simple remote that came with the TV. I bought the keyboard remote as well which I rarely use, but it's nice to have in the event I need to do more in depth surfing on the TV. On a side note, when I got the TV  it was not for the 3D. After having the TV for about a month. I said you know what this TV has 3D and I've never used it. Let me check it out. I have Stars which has 3D movies for subscribers to their movies. I started the new Wizard of Oz with James Franco. The movie in 3D blew my mind. It's like having your own movie theater right in your house. Without a doubt the best TV I've bought in the last couple of years.For me their are only two downsides to this particular model.1. The sound is not great at all. But I knew that going into this. I mean really, how great do you think the sound would be on a TV this slim. Not great at all. That's why I bought the Bose Cinemate sound bar at the same time I bought the TV. Now I have the ultimate in sound and picture. I have completely transformed my living room into my own private theater. My friends are really jealous. :0)2. I wish the TV had the capability to erase all the history cookies that are sent to you when you look up something. I contacted Samsung and they said they are working on upgrading the TV to have that function. Not really that big of a deal. I just like to be able to erase any history that I might have.To sum it up...The Samsung UN65F7100 65-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Ultra Slim Smart LED HDTV is without a doubt a great TV and I would highly recommend to anyone looking to improving their viewing experience.I'm watching the winter Olympics now and you can literally see the sweat on the athletes faces.

If you are looking for a mid/high end television but don't want to spend $2,000 or more then seriously consider this TV. This is my second TV purchase in the past 10 years, my previous set being a 32\" Samsung LCD which was mid/high end back in 2004. I'll provide three quick high points of the TV and what I look for in making a long term investment in a television.First, the microdimming makes the blacks black and the whites white without washing out colors.  Second, glare reduction coating is amazing and is even better than a simple matte finish on some lower end sets (one of the main reasons I've been so diligent in reasearching televisions is because I have a bay window opposite of my tv that lets in huge amounts of sunlight). Third, game mode, I have been called a cheater and a hacker several times now in the first week of using this TV.  And I can safely say that the 30m/s processing time is to blame, people just can't compete in first person shooters.I would highly recommend properly setting up the Television before trying to judge or review the tv.  Most importantly, turn Auto-Motion Plus to Standard mode if you're not watching High Definition sports, as it just creates a jittery picture/\"soap opera\" effect.  Several reviews have posted calibrations that they have used on their sets.  I would use them as a guide and adjust slightly to your liking, because not every screen, room or person is exactly the same.Now for the reasons why I took away 1 star; Smart Features, Remote and 3-D.  These are all gimmicks shoved in consumers faces by the major companies, don't purchase a TV based soley on these features.  In regards to the smart features, a good Blueray player or Playstation 3/4 will render all of the apps sluggish, bland and overall worthless.  Next,the Remote is built on a great idea which isn't executed properly (or technology just isn't ready for intelligent televisions and remotes).  I would recommend using your cable box remote or a universal remote.  Finally, 3D, it's just a fad.  Look at the trend of 3D movies in theaters and you'll see that current 3D technologies aren't going to be the future of movies, gaming or television.Closing Summary, If you want a TV with the best picture to price ratio on the market right now, this is the TV for you.  Forget about the gimmicky features and get this TV, it will impress for years to come and with Samsung's track record; it will last for many years.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Go head and buy it.", "Author": "R.B", "ReviewID": "R3QDHITF43V0FK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, I am not writing about the specifics of this TV, I am just trying to help people who are thinking or planning to buy it.I like to add, that prior to my purchase, I did my research and read reviews for months too, until I get it and here my review :This TV is very beautiful and easy to set up.  So when the TV is \"ON\" the picture is stunning ( WOW ) , of course I modified the picture setting, changed it to my preferences and the way it suit my eyes. The 3D is real and incredible. Sound is fine ( not bad as some reviews complained about it, come on!! they must be deaf...lol ), Smartv apps are nice and work good.

As most people here, I have spent about 4 weeks solid; reviewing tv's, and stalking them as well. I have been to BB, HHREGG, as well as a few other specialty stores, and spent 2 to 4 hours in each store. (i'm retired so i can afford to do so).I have asked the sales people to insert proprietary 3d disks. The only thing that has not been possible is to attach my Xfinity/Comcast cable box to these tv's to compare the difference in picture quality.The first thing that needs to be said is that none of these stores selling said tv's have calibrated them. So some tv's that are highly rated on the internet, look terrible in the store.One example is  the Panasonic 65\" ZT Series Plasma HDTV, which was placed directly in bright lights in the hhregg store. The poor tv looked lousy and dark...Sniff.Another thing that you should know about the reviewer (me) is that I have been actively creating 3d objects and graphics for years. Resolution and color representation are so important to me.Couple this with the fact that I have light to moderate Aspergers. I can focus on microscopic details and differences for hours. Idiotic perfection of sorts. It's a blessing and a curse.The contenders we have selected for purchase (within our budget) as of today are :Sony 65\" XBR Series LED Ultra HDTVSamsung 75\" Series 7 LED HDTV - UN75F7100Sony KDL-70R550A 70-Inch 120Hz 1080pVIZIO M801d-A3 80-Inch 1080pPanasonic 65\" ZT Series Plasma HDTV.As of this writing, we have eliminated the Sony KDL-70R550A. Although it is by far the most affordable ($2100), the colors and picture quality are simply inferior to the others above.We are also probably going to eliminate the Panasonic plasma for whatever reason, the 3d was not amazing, and it's only a 65\" screen.If you mention the name VIZIO to me, I will start getting cold sweats. Although the Vizio M series affords plenty of great reviews, I still have a psychological barrier towards stereotypical cheaper brands. Quite frankly, I also have a barriers towards Kia and Hyundai, although they are great cars.I have had plenty of time to observe the vizio M801d-A3 and the Vizio M701d-A3 in action. Despite my mistrust in the brand, the picture both in 2d and 3d is excellent. Many reviewers  have said that the screen is too reflective and that there are problems operating the remote control on these models though. The screen on the Samsung 75\" Series 7 LED HDTV - UN75F7100, is also just as reflective. The color representation and picture quality of the Samsung is superior to the Vizio though.Anyone who is considering the purchase of a Sharp Aquos should definitely compare/study Vizio M models as well. Personally, I would buy the Vizio over the Sharps, I prefer the Vizios image over the Sharps, and the Sharp 80\" is very expensive too compared to Vizio. If anyone here is considering a Samsung 7100 or 8000 LED, do not even bother checking out the Vizios or the Sharp models.I hesitated a long time Over the Samsung models, and when my research was over, I invited my wife to review the results.The 3 models we studied were the Samsung 4k ultra @ 65\" and both the UN75F7100 and UNF8000 both at 75\".I saw very little picture quality difference between the UN75F7100 and UNF8000, however the 8000 series is much more expensive. For this reason we eliminated it.My wife and I have Apple Tv at home, so we are less interested in Apps and gaming. We like watching movies both in 2d and 3d.Next we compared the 4K ultra Tv's, the sony Xbr and the Samsung 4k. Both have a 65\" screen.For some odd reason we did not find the Samsung 4k impressive. We played a few Sony Demos on it as well as watched a few 3d movies on it, and It was marginally better than the Samsung UN75F7100. Also the 4k is more expensive by $2000.The 3d movies we watched were nearly just as good on the UN75F7100. We also found that the UN75F7100 had better COLOR REPRESENTATION...wait let me explain !!!The sony XBR 4K.If money were no object, I would buy the 85\" model of the Sony XBR 4 K ULTRA, right now.The sony XBR is by far the best picture quality and especially COLOR representation we have seen. By far!!!If you do not believe me, get a few 2d~3d movies you guys like, and go and force the sales people to play them on the Sony.Sony is reluctant to allow third party content to play on their demo Tv's because they want to show you their demo stuff (that looks exceptional BTW. But if you are going to spend 5k on a TV it's your right to be anally retentive.The picture quality, the perfection of color, and the passive 3d blew us away. This tv does an amazing job at up scaling content to a higher a definition of clarity and color.For me, the difference between the Sony and most of the other Tv's was like creating a picture in Photoshop at 72 pixels per inch and then creating the same picture at 300ppi, then comparing the two. Forget the fact that there is little to no real 4k content yet. This tv has by far the best picture.The huge dilemma we now have is. Which of these two tv's are we going to buy? The samsung UN75F7100 or the Sony 4K. The samsung is much larger +10\", but the Sony is better quality in picture and color.We found that the samsung UN75F7100 was not far behind in color, but there was still a visible difference. The sony image is much crisper/clearer. A higher definition, no doubt.The samsung screen is much like the vizio, extremely reflective to any object that may be in front of it.We preferred the sony's screen.Another dilemma we have is that we view tv from 12 feet away, so logically the 75\" samsung would be a better choice. Price wise they are more or less the same given a few hundred dollars.We did find the Samsungs stand quite unpractical. Due to the relatively long TV one needs two small tables at either end of the tv. We cannot wall mount it.The speakers are no doubt better on the sony which has speakers on either side of the screen. Anyhow, all these tv's warrant an added sound bar, so who cares about the original factory sound?Sony is coming out with the same tv in a few weeks without the speakers, So i may wait until I finally decide which of these two to purchase.Hope this review helps you guys choose a tv.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great LED TV with one major deal breaker", "Author": "J.

Nice picture, once it is adjusted.What I do not like\u2026.The side-viewing angle is somewhat limited, but no so narrow that it\u2019s impossible to view from the side.In 3 of the 4 picture modes, the tv uses micro-dimming (MD) and it can\u2019t be turned off.  Only the \u201cMovie\u201d mode turns the MD off.  I find that the MD is very distracting and if it weren't for the \u201cmovie\u201d mode, I would have sent the tv back.It took me nearly a week of tweaking and fine-tuning before the picture color and contrast were acceptable. Getting the contrast right was the most difficult issue.The tv has a digital optical audio output for audio receivers that do not have HDMI inputs.  The problem is that the tv only outputs 2 channel sound from this output, not 5.1 from the sources that are input into the tv (Cable box, DVD, etc.)  Although, it will output 5.1 from the smart apps, like Youtube, netfix, etc.) This problem might not be solely unique to this tv, I believe it may be the case with all tvs. Also, the sound/picture sync adjustment is not effective when you use the audio optical output, just the sound that is output through the HDMI connection.The inputs for older equipment are limited.

Instead, the guy also educated me on what I should do if there is a problem with the TV and how Amazon would deal with it.I plugged in the TV, powered it on. Went through a set-up program, much like a phone/computer/gaming console. I connected the TV to my wireless network, which has a password and MAC filtering. The TV gives you the MAC address right up front as it is performing the connection, so you don't have to search for it. Connected without a problem. Can't say anything for the Smart HUB function with a provider, since I don't have cable or satellite.I then attached my tablet with a HDMI cable, just to do a fast check with Netflix (TV has Netflix app itself, but I didn't go that route initially) to see if there were any dead pixels. I didn't see any.I will say that the remote takes some getting used to. It is small, and doesn't have many buttons. Relies on a menu on the TV that pops up. You then use the trackpad (or whatever it is) to navigate. You slide your finger across it to move the on-screen cursor, and push it in as a button. You don't tap it like a phone, you actually push it in. I prefer the classic TV remotes. Course, this remote has the basics, volume and channel up/down. To punch in numbers individually, you actually write them in on the trackpad.Sound is actually much better than I expected, being only 1\"+ in thickness.

After reading some bad reviews, I decided to purchase the extended warranty just in case. Amazon offered the best warranty for the longest period at the best price. The 3D is wonderful on both TV's. my only issue is that on the 65\"(when watching normal TV-not fast paced sports), there seems to be a slight jitter when the subject on the screen moves very quickly. I think that has something to do with the 240 Hz.setting. I will look into it and I am sure that I can re-adjust a setting to fix this issue. The only thing that I have not tried is the voice control on the remote. This new generation remote works very well moving between normal TV and the smart TV settings. I would highly recommend both the older 55\" and this newer 65\" version.

This TV has all the specs I was shopping for, and some I wasn't (like 3D, really who needs it),  The greatest thing though, has been something I didn't even know I was missing before.  The dual core processor give a practically instant startup, and since all connectivity is through the built-in wi-fi, there is no need to wait for multiple component to start up.  Also, did I mention the ONE convenient small remote.  The sound on this set is good enough in a medium sized living room that I don't feel the need for a home theater or additional speakers.So to recap.  I love this TV because I could mount it on my wall, hide one power cord and I was finished.

I'm going to try and be as honest and straight forward as possible.First, while researching LED tvs there are some things you HAVE to know. LED tvs have lighting issues, and it's not set to one brand or specific company, it's the technology, in my opinion LED tvs still just aren't there quality wise, which doesn't make sense as they've been on the market for years and the quality control between brands is wildly different. You're basically playing the panel lottery any time you purchase a LARGE LED tv set, period. Smaller LED tvs usually don't have the below issues as much.LED tvs can have issues such as:- Flash lighting (where lights from the LEDS will shine back into the panel in each corner or from the edges)- Clouding (This a defect in the panel in which lights can look cloudy in dark or black spaces - Try a youtube or google search on this one)- Banding (This effects the image in a way that looks like a ripple in water is appearing in dark spaces - again try a google image or youtube search)- Different brands use different companies to supply the actual panel/displays. Samsung uses 3 different factories for their displays, which means some factories will have better quality control than others, this is why you play the panel lottery when you purchase a LED tv of this size, and unfortunately tvs in the same class from other companies fall into the same or similar issues.PROS:- The picture quality of this tv is pretty amazing. We purchased the 60\" model and was amazed at how HD anything looks on this tv right out of the box.- We love the remote, we've seen tons of people complain about it, but we haven't had any issues, but we own two apple tv boxes in our home and are used to touch remotes using our phones. This isn't much different at all, and most people just don't know how to use the remote intuitively. It works completely fine, and if you just thought of the touch area as a mouse you'll tend to learn it a bit faster. You can scroll vertically in menus so that you don't have to go back each time to change a setting, which most people tend to not know.- The panel itself is superbly thin, another qualifier when we were researching tvs, we also love the stand, an Apple tv box and the IR for the remote fit perfectly underneath in the middle.- Setup was a breeze, as was the wifi connecting, which so many people seem to have issues with. For some bg info we have a Apple Airport Extreme Router, with a 30mb down 3 up connection. That maybe why we get such good results.- The OS (operating system) was quick, and the design was nice and simple to use, compared to some other tvs we tried and like this one most.CONS:- Unfortunately my unit has both fashlighting and clouding. The flashlighting isn't bad on our unit, only at the top and bottom just above the logo. The clouding however, is pretty bad, but we weren't going to send the unit back to amazon again just to play the panel lottery. There's a huge chance to get one worse or equal to the problems you may already have. Yes this is an expensive purchase, be we feel it's not worth the hassle.- This set has a terrible side viewing angle. Anything passed 90 degrees and the contrast, color and darks fade away instantly. Terrible for a tv of this cost, size, and quality. Our couch sits about 6ft away from this beast, so if your tv is in a bigger space this may not be as big of a deal to some of you. We do plan on moving to someplace bigger and will hopefully be able to deal with this issue better down the road.- Picture settings. It's not the settings themselves that has the issue. It's getting this tv setup for your liking. We're STILL trying to get each input set to what each device needs to be nearly 3 weeks later. It takes a long time to get this tv setup right, it looks awesome in HD but looks absolutely terrible for normal SD 480i tv. It's basically forcing us to upgrade to HD (we're fine with that, but be aware that normal tv viewing looks like crap right out of the box) you will have to spend a great deal of time setting the picture up for a great viewing experience. We also tried many of the settings posted in the reviews, and while all of them made HD look even more gorgeous it just made watching regular tv even worse. We're still continuously setting ours to get it just right.To be clear the picture settings we continuously run into are usually the skin tones and colors. On standard definition tv if you don't have it set JUST right, skin tones are either way over or under saturated with oranges or reds. We also have to compensate for the flash and cloud lighting. Changing the settings can improve both of those issues depending on how bad your tv is, ours does become acceptable after playing around with settings and even helps the side angles some, but we haven't found a perfect medium for all four of those issues yet, which is why we have continuously had to play with it.- This Tv pretty much requires a software upgrade to fix some color issues and bugs. Ours failed in the setup but went through when we ran the update after the tv was setup. Here's a tip though, as painful as this is to do. People have had better results after doing an update, completely resetting the tv and all it's settings and starting over again like the tv is new. This assures that the software installs correctly and your tv is fully up to date without any issues.MISC:- We haven't tried the 3D yet, but we didn't purchase this tv for the 3D, we bought it for the 240hz which is only available on most 3d tvs.- We haven't tried any of the included apps or services (like hulu or amazon instant) we have all that already, just about every home device includes smart features, our xbox, playstation, apple tv, and bluray players all have the same thing as this tv. It wasn't important to us.OVERALL:We're not in Love with this set, but nor do we hate it. It's just an \"OK\" tv. We had a 6 year old JVC LCD 42\" with an ipod dock before this one, and while it also had flashlighting issues, it looked great right out of the box, we didn't have to spend weeks setting it up, had perfect side viewing angles, the ipod dock worked great, and hadn't had any issues with it since we bought it. It will now sit in our bedroom for the next 5 years or until it goes out. The Samsung tv has been a hassle to setup, and we hate the side viewing angles, even if we were in a bigger space, we don't believe a tv of this size and cost from a reputable company should have any issues like this in 2013. Samsung also needs to get it's quality control better. Flashlighting and Clouding has been in LCD and LED tvs for the last 10 or so years, and they've been doing this too long for these issues still be a problem. Technology has moved passed these issues and shouldn't be an issue at all at this point.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far, so good.", "Author": "Allen s", "ReviewID": "R2M1S9AZYQAAPP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, this has been a great purchase.I was worried it wouldn't survive the shipping, and indeed, the box arrived with somescrapes and bashes, but there is so much styrofoam inside that everything was fine.Easy set up, although I admit I haven't tried a lot of the features yet, such as the active 3-D.I got the 46\" version.Let me say what my first impressions were.The frame is silver. I thought it would be black. No, but it's so thin it's not a problem.The stand is very attractive, but is large, so if you think you can shove this against the wall, think again.Four legs project in each direction. I have it on a Ikea Hemnes unit, and it's in the center.I remember when I thought a 19\" TV was adequate, after setting up the 46\",my first reaction was, \"I should have gotten the 55\".At the time, I didn't want to trade features for inches. The 55\" was another $300-$400, eh.Lots of adjustments, very user friendly. Intuitive.The remote with a touch pad works okay. I hate remotes with 500 buttons.I'd like to find a universal remote for all devices with a touch screen....and a reasonable price.Developers: How about an I-pad with a screen that says \"TV\", \"DVD\", \"Cable\", etc.Then, when you touch that icon, you only see the buttons necessary for that device.I don't need \"Play\" when I'm watching off air.(I know there's an app, but it gets terrible reviews.)Must haves for me were 1080P, an analog audio out, LED, at least 120 refresh rate, built in wi-fi, optional 3-D.That narrowed it down to two brands Sony and Samsung (of the \"name\" brands.)Why would anyone need 4 HDMI inputs? Give me choices!Samsung won.During the initial set up, it found my router easily, so I expect things like Netflix will be trouble free.Sometimes the devices are too smart. If you are playing a DVD, and for some reason change inputs,the TV says, \"Oh he'd done with the DVD\", and shuts it off. Thereby, going to the beginning again. Hey, let me decide!(My Sharp Aquos does the same thing).I can watch a movie with only the DVD remote, since the TV turns itself on when it sees the DVD fire up.So it's not always frustrating, just don't do anything to confuse it.This thing has more options than the space shuttle, I haven't scratched the surface.If I find a problem, I'll update this review.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "Hojin Kim", "ReviewID": "R3Y5ZUODS3OIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "screen was bigger than expected.

I have read a handful of reviews. Some have mentioned average picture quality, or shallow blacks, etc. Personally, as an average consumer like me, picture quality is amazing! It blows away my older Samsung TV. The best out of the box mode you should set it to is definitely the Movie Mode. All other modes like Dynamic Mode, is just too saturated and bright; not close to natural colors and tones.I used my Xbox One to calibrate the basic adjustments in Movie Mode, such as black levels and brightness, etc. It required very little adjustment. Great picture quality out the box! There is some degradation of picture quality as you stir away from the center of the TV. The viewing angles is fairly narrow. But you would have to be sitting an angle where you probably shouldn't be sitting while you're watching TV, movies or playing video games, to notice huge picture quality reduction.I cared less of the offering of the Smart Hub. Simply because my Xbox One offers most of the built-in apps. My stand alone cable box is linked to it too. Nonetheless, I did give it a whirl to see what it offers. The idea is cool, but the execution isn't great. Launching apps is slow and it lags quite a lot. So if you have Xbox One or PS4, your buying decision should be based, majority on picture quality, more so than the 'bells and whistles'.If this is going to be your main entertainment hub, Smart Hub user experience may not be the best.Overall, this TV is awesome!

I suspect you have too at this point.Mine is a 7150 not a 7100. and I got it at a specialized dealer that deals in customer returns that he job-lots from the big box stores, so I got mine for 999.00 in perfect condition with a keyboard, remote, and 4 glasses, just no box. What a deal!I subscribe to a lot of home theatre sites and I also work in the integration/medical community so I wont bore you with stats, but, I think I am safe in saying this is a decent TV.There are a lot of folks that have went to a great deal of trouble to point out all the +/_'s to this TV and my thanks to all of them!My opinion is, if you can get it at a reasonable price, don't hesitate. It's almost perfect.You will appreciate the features and quality period. I just hope you don't sell the farm to get one. I wouldn't pay more than 1500.cdnOne feature I was disappointed in was that the stand cannot be made to swivel 360degs. I know I tried. Mine sits in between the kitchen and the living room on a separation wall, and I customized my old one to swivel to view it in both rooms. Too bad, that would have made it perfect!Here is my big point to add.. If you are looking for a smart TV don't be swayed by 3D - you will probably only use it 5% of the time if that. Be more willing to pony up the bucks for power in the processing dept. The faster the computer in the TV the better! Nothing worse than waiting for ever for things to load.  This TV is ok in that department but not great, but the price appeases me in that regard.All in all you can't go wrong with this TV it is solidly in the middle of performance and cost and pushing the edge of mid/high end with quality, and features.Hope you enjoy your's!", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compare and contrast!", "Author": "Philip", "ReviewID": "R3BDV6MEXBIJEH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My girlfriend just gone one of these last night, after we spent quite some time studying the pictures and features of the various TVs in the store.  One of the features that really impressed us about this TV was the contrast range (or dynamic range as you'll call it if you're a photo guy like me).  It's excellent.  What does that mean?  Well, do you like visually dark movies, like many Batman movies, or Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow?  This TV will show you things you've never seen before in those movies.  Visually dark movies can be very moving, but at times I've felt they were hiding too much.  I want to re-watch all those movies now with this TV, because Sleepy Hollow was a whole new (and better) movie.  We're in a digital age, and one way that digital still can't compare to film is dynamic range.  Real film can show you more ranges of black or dark gray than most digital formats.  But this TV goes a long way toward changing that; the picture you see is a lot closer to what was recorded on the film.Others have commented on the size, clarity, software features, etc., so I'll just say that overall this seems like a really great TV so far.  But boy, is that contrast range impressive!Further comments; some people don't like the way the remote works.  I can kind of see why, but my GF says you just need to get used to it.  So there's that, for whatever it's worth.One quirk; a couple of times now, the picture has dimmed a bit.  We did some digging, and apparently this is because of a feature called microdimming.  It only happens under certain picture conditions, like a brightly dressed performer on a dark stage.  Now, I can't find that term in the manual.  The word \"dimming\" takes you to a discussion of the energy saving modes, and we've turned those off so we'll see if that does anything.  The other reviewer also says microdimming happens in standard mode, so we've changed it to natural mode.  We'll see what happens.  Honestly, if this microdimming is just part of the package, we'll live with it.  The TV is still fantastic.Update about 6 months in; we're still marveling at the picture quality.  The remote is a bit quirky, but it's not the end of the world.

I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. This TV is an LED TV, but don't let that confuse you. LED is similar to LCD, LED basically means that the TV is back-lit better and in turn makes sure their are no dark spots on the screen. Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a store to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step you need to look at is what features come with the TV. Here are a few that come with this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.This Samsung also has Smart Hub organizes your entertainment and content into 5 convenient panels: On TV, Movies and TV Shows, Social, Apps, and a panel for your Photos, Videos and Music.To add this Samsung has a Dual Core Processor that allow you to perform multiple tasks at the same time. It also enables fast web browsing while playing apps or TV programs that you've recently opened through the Recent History feature.The next thing is in box technology:With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.Cons: Nothing", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Actually Easy To Adjust If You Realize....", "Author": "Neil Shapiro \"Thoth\"", "ReviewID": "R2N9NGIC9QCGK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I almost did not buy this TV after reading some of the 5-star reviews! I actually did not buy it from Amazon but from a local store because some of the 5-star reviews had me thinking it would be 50/50 if I could get it adjusted right and I didn't want to have to rebox it if I returned it. If you have been reading the reviews here and thinking, \"OMG I will never be able to adjust this picture\" then read on.At issue here are the complex advanced settings as well as a lot of the reviewer-recommended settings have the contrast at or near 100. To me, if you have to blow-out a control to ultimate max then that indicates two things to me. First would be a design error as you should never have to max out a setting. Second would be what do you do with inevitable degradation after a few years of the screen and no way to turn up that control further?I had the TV delivered and setup by the usual group of know-nothings and when they left I brought out my favorite adjust-a-new-TV tool the \"Spears and Munsil High-Definition benchmark Blu-Ray Edition\" Blu-Ray disc. This disc is replete with test patterns and walkthrough guidance in using each one. Some are not too applicable to LED screens but others that allow you to use such things as PLUGE patterns to set contrast and brightness are just indispensable. I got my Spears and Munsil from Amazon and I recommend for more info on what it is you check it out here.So, I turned on the TV. As the reviewers said it was set to Dynamic Mode. I felt that it was not way way off in settings but considerably so and needed some tweaking. But the most complete reviews as to settings all seemed to recommend Movie mode and a contrast at or near 100. Huh? I switched to Movie Mode and sure enough what a washed out picture. But I was not surprised. Look, when you go into a movie theater which is showing a film what is the first thing you notice even before the movie? That it is dark! Really, really, really dark with the light coming from the movie and a few red LEDs on the floor so you don't kill yourself on a step.Movie Mode recreates how the cinematographers wanted the film to be viewed as to color level, white balance, contrast, etc. But they never thought the lights would be turned on in the theater enough to maybe read a book, carry on a conversation with the wife or all the other things we typically do when we watch TV socially as opposed to watching a film in a theater. It was nighttime so I turned off all the lights in the room and even closed the blackout curtains in the skylights so no moon glow.The picture was no longer washed out but still could use tweaking. Turned the lights back on in the room to the ;level they usually are at when we watch TV. Broke out my Spars and Munsil test patterns and set to work. Well, not much work. In about a half an hour I had the thing adjusted in Dynamic Mode to where you would swear it was the best picture you have ever seen. I did NOT go into the advanced settings at all and I really recommend you stay away from those. That way lies madness.My Spears and Munsil tested settings? Keep in mind that you will have different room light and ambience and etc. but for what it is worth they wound up as Dynamic Mode, Backlight 20, Contrast 79, Brightness 55, Sharpness 58, Color 50, G48/R52. You might also want to choose your HDMI black level and some of the other settings that wind up basically personal preference. Oh, and when I turn off the lights to simulate a theater and go to Movie Mode, looks great too!So setting was as easy as pie with the right tool.But I also think that if you simply understand what contrast should look like you could do it by eye as well. Just remember -- in Movie Mode you want to have a dark, dark Movie room as opposed to real life.Overall the TV has been fantastic. I did buy the keyboard and have found that to be the most useful accessory. I have tyne camera but the movement recognition is mostly a gimmick IMHO and I don't use Skype so....Oh, one thing was driving me nuts. I have a Yamaha receiver (as Samsung does not make home theater receivers just sound bar/speaker combos) and like to switch all inputs through that. Well, the receiver would be on Cable TV through HDMI but then after about 20 seconds it would switch to ARC as the Samsung TV automatically sends the switch-to-ARC code which, I am guessing, the Samsung audio equipment needs, No way to turn off that without turning off all HDMI control and I wanted to have that for my Samsung Blu Ray. Anyway, if you have a receiver bothered by that, at the receiver end just turn off HDMI control. Then, after the TV sends the code you can turn it back on and all will be well. But you need to do that every session. Or, just leave it off and only turn it on when you want to do a Smart App or otherwise play internally-generated TV audio on your amp.I love this TV!

I have had tremendous success with Samsung and Amazon's service has always been good to me.  I had done some research on this TV before I bought it and decided for the price point I would purchase one.  Sold by Paul's TV and fulfilled by Amazon $1649. Product came in the time described and the box was completely intact with no issues.  TV looked fine and set up nice.  After numerous adjustments to try to get the picture to not have bad shading and ghosting and overall haze I called Samsung customer service and my call was answered right away.  I explained the issue that I was having and the lady guided me through some processes that I had already tried.  She finally concluded that I need to have the set serviced.  If for some reason the service guy didn't find anything wrong with the TV then I would have to pay the service charge which according to the local dealer said would be a $100 bill. So instead of taking the chance of having to pay the service fee and then having a TV that I wasn't happy with I decided to send the set back and order a new set.  To be fair I had my father-in-laws older 8000 in it place in the 55 in size class and it was outstanding.  That set was a 2010 model but it was way better than the 7100 that I had ordered so I am sure my expectations were high in the first place.  I have seen this set hooked up at Best Buy and it was very good so I am thinking it was just this set.  Amazon took the set back without any questions and is refunding my account.

The picture is equally stunning with a fluid picture comparable to the movement of water. The colors literally leap off the screen and after professional calibration they seem to be very accurate.Pros:ColorMotion rate, clarityphysical design..literally like 3/4 of an inch thick at it's thickest pointCons:Firstly let me explain why i gave this TV a 4 star rating... in a well lit room like with the blinds open or 1 to two laps on the picture is perfect..no issues what so ever. However if the TV is located in a pitch black room or very low lighted room then you will start to notice the typical crux of edge lit LED TVs... the flash lightening or clouding as it is sometimes refereed to. This means that you can see shadows, or flashlight patterns of light emanating from the corners of the TV pointing towards the center, this effect is usually only noticed in very dark movie scenes or pure black backgrounds. This flash lighting is literally un noticeable in a decently lit room for example your living room, however in a pitch black room this effect becomes more noticeable. This effect can be tamed using the setting of standard under the picture options/settings but is still noticeable in dark rooms.Other:The 3D on the TV is impressive, but not worth being the sole reason for purchasing the TV. The smart features of the TV are pretty impressive but not as fast/intuitive as say an Apple TV.Final Verdict:Picture Quality: 9/10 due to flash lightingPerformance: 9/10 due to somewhat sluggish smart features, (which are still the best smart features to be integrated in a TV)Design: 10/10 Beautiful minimalist design, razor slim, clean appearance, awesome remote controlI would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "all the apps are appear very clear, sharp, watching any app is like that movment happens in front of you.", "Author": "Dinesh Chheda", "ReviewID": "R2OFDEF8E2Z7TD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Watching TV is very sharp, clear.

I use this TV primarily for gaming/blueray and havent seen any problems so far, blurays look awesome, havent tested out the 3D features yet but seemed to work pretty well when I saw this TV at bestbuy. One of the reasons I chose this model vs the model higher is that it didnt seem to have that annoying white bled through that i saw in the higher model(7500, halo effect-and that may be only how they had it configured at BB as this TV seems to have a lot of different viewing modes). For gaming I have both a PS4 and a PS3, The PS4 looks amazing in Killzone shadowfalls I spend a lot of time just looking at the enviroments as some of them are very impressive, I havent seen any screen tearing or ghosting yet for either system (though i am no A/V guru) The Tv's speakers are suprisingly loud for such a thin TV(I would still recommend to buying a sound system as you are not getting any bass or... okay really buy a sound system) and yes I am shopping for a sound system, looks like I might get the klipsch SB3(its a sound bar with a subwoofer-great for small apartments?)The remote is a little strange as it does not have channel numbers you instead can draw out a number on the touch pad or (I havent tried it yet) you can use voice commands as well. The trackpad is used to navigate the smart features such as the web,apps,etc(I do wish they had a a thumbstick like a game controller as well as the trackpad as you are constantly having to repostion your finger back onto the trackpad as it is very small)Final thoughts- I did alot*2 of research before I bought this TV, and this TV had the best bang for the buck(the higher model TV's primary advantages seem to have equal disadvantages ie better blacks-more halos, and even when i didnt see the halos the diffrence was small enough that I dont mind when the TV is by itself with no better tv right next to it to compare( well except for the 4K tvs, and why didnt I go for a 4K you ask? smallest 4K tv so far 55\" and I live in a small apartment+ there does not seem to be any content yet).Again I am not a A/V guru, but I do recommend this TV so far for its great picture,  its awesome thin bezel, its ability to display games with no issues(so far), just a great overall TV(-the sound buts thats common with all thin tvs).", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Alberto Gines", "ReviewID": "R1NKWRZ4GGKB5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Expensive yes, worth it yes.The quality of the picture is really good.

The 3d that comes with this model was just a bonus.  However it's a huge bonus.  I watched a few DVD's made for 3d and it was incredible.  Even the conversion from 2d to 3d isn't too bad on most programs.  The remote that comes with it is one of those remotes you can talk into for different functions.  I have used it some with limited success but it does work as expected when the user (me) gets it right, just takes some playing.Even though this is a product review, have to give Amazon 5 stars for free Prime shipping and getting it here on time.

The images are fantastic and fairly leap off the screen at you.  It integrated seamlessly with my Verizon FiOS TV and the universal remote did not need so much as a single command programmed although I confess that some of the commands are not exactly intuitive.  I'm sure they will become so over time.  This product would get five stars if it wasn't for the software.I am reasonably techno-literate but by the end of the weekend I spent trying to set up the absolutely AWFUL Samsung allshare software I was ready to give up.  I have a simple network with a NAS box which stores most of my digital content.  I connected the TV to the network without a hitch and it recognized everything on the network without a problem (it even correctly identified the other STBs in the house and my Sonos system) but when I attempted to navigate to the content all I got was a \"no content available on this device\" message.  No \"you must install allshare software to be able to view content on your TV\" or any other helpful message.  There was no CD in the box and no instructions anywhere in the documents supplied with the TV (yes I checked and yes I am sure)  -it was only when I went online and looked at the 500+ page manual did I figure out that I needed to install the allshare software to be able to stream content.Fair enough I suppose but wouldn't you THEN think that the software would be available for download from Samsung's site?  Nope.  I navigated to the model-specific webpage and chose 'downloads'  -nothing.  I searched the site.  Nothing.  I found a few helpful posts from others in my situation but the links they posted to the download sites were dead.  I finally managed to download a copy of the current version of allshare from a third party mirror site and that's where the fun began.The allshare product SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK.  It doesn't work.  Ca ne marche pas.  No trabajar.  First off it doesn't completely install;  the installshield wizard hangs and if you terminate the process it will start up normally.  Second the UI looks as if it was written by prisoners of war and is utterly unintuitive;  there are no real 'help' screens to speak of and everything is written in insider buzzwords so figuring out how to configure the software is a challenge.  But all that aside, the product simply fails to recognize content and stream it to your TV.  I spent a very frustrating evening trying to get it to work and ultimately had to give up and download a copy of Serviio which worked right away in the first install.I know Samsung fancy themselves as giving Apple a real run for its money.

Ever since the delivery arrived it has monopolized my viewing time. I barely use my other \u201cdumb\u201d TVs anymore. Between the amazing and pleasurable viewing experience and the convenience of a vast array of apps directly available from the TV I see no need for my other TVs. My experience with the TV has been very positive but it has come with a few minor stumbles along the way. I intend to go a little deeper into both the pros and cons and hope this review helps you decide whether this model is right for you.Pros (continuation)1- When I went looking for a new TV for my living room I was looking for a high end TV that would not break the bank. I was looking for something close to theater experience when it came to 3D movies. I am a huge fan of 3D movies and all I can say is that this TV does not disappoint. The movies look pretty amazing. I dare to say they look just as good as the theater. With that said, most of the television I do watch is normal regular TV. I watch a lot of Netflix and YouTube on the TV and for the most part all of the videos look fantastic. Some of the videos on YouTube look grainy but that is because of the native resolution of the video itself, it has nothing to do with the TV. I am not an expert and I don\u2019t pretend to be. All I know is that the picture quality is very, very good and the TV looks noticeable better than the other LCD TVs I have in my house.2- One of the things that make this TV so appealing is its slim profile. The TV is a real looker. Everyone that has been to my house instantly notices it. It is honestly hard not to. You have a TV that is 55\u201d big and is about an inch thick. The bezels are extremely small too. When you are watching it you are pretty much looking all screen. My other TV by comparison has a 52\u201d inch screen and is 7\u201d inches longer due to the wide bezels. It honestly looks like a dinosaur in comparison. There is not much more to say here, Samsung nailed it in the aesthetic department. If you are still not convinced go to your local electronic store and take a look at it for yourself. You will be blown away.3- Another aspect of the TV that I really like is having access to all of my favorite apps without having to hook up a computer or a set up box. I like having access to all of it in a single controller. No more having to deal with a keyboard or mouse to have access to Netflix or YouTube directly from your TV. All of the big apps are available for free on the play store and most of them work without any problems. I have seen Netflix, YouTube, Pandora, Hulu, Amazon, Spotify and many other ones. The only one I wish was available was the Google Music App. I believe that one is only available on LG TVs. It is pretty simple to navigate the apps with the remote controller. The only exception is when I am trying to locate a specific video on YouTube. It is annoying and time consuming to search letter by letter on the remote control. Fortunately, you can use your smartphone or tablet that has the YouTube app to \u201ccast\u201d the video on the TV. It works just like with the Google Chromecast. It is very easy to use and my phone connects flawlessly with the TV.4- I have a lot of old DVDs that I have ripped and have digital copies of them on my computer hard drive. I have saved many of them on a USB and have tested them on the TV. It has recognized every single type of file I have thrown at it. I love being able to see all my pictures and videos any time without the need of a DVD player. It is a very convenient feature and one I was unaware of when I purchased the TV.Cons (continuation)1- The biggest issue I had by far with this TV has been the 3D glasses. The TV come with a set of 4 glasses. The model number of the glasses is SSG-5100GB. They are total garbage. They sometimes take a good minute to detect that the TV is playing a 3D movies. But that would not be that much of an issue if they would stay connected. You start watching a movie and if you move your head too often the glasses disconnect themselves. EXTREMELY irritating when you are trying to watch a fast pace movie and you get a blurred screen in the middle of it because you decided to look down for a second. Most of the time that they disconnect you have to go ahead turn them back on and pray that they reconnect quickly. My friend bought the 65\u201d inch model of this exact same TV and he got a different model of 3D glasses that are much, much better. They connect themselves instantly and they stay connected at all times. I have considered buying a different model to replace the factory ones. I don\u2019t know if maybe Samsung has replaced the factory models. Just do your research on what model of 3D glasses the TV comes with. If it is this one then be prepare to deal with this headache.2- In a few occasions while watching Netflix I have had the TV suddenly lose internet connection. When it has happened I have quickly resolved the issue by unplugging and reconnecting my router. It does not happen often but it has happened on more than one occasion and I have not been able to find another solution. I have over 10 devices connected to the same router and the only one that has this problem is this TV. Maybe it is some sort of compatibility problem but it is not bad enough for me to consider buying another router. It is just a mild annoyance that happens about once a month or so. Not that big of a deal but something you need to keep in mind.3- Before purchasing this TV in particular I did some research regarding its \u201csmart\u201d features. I saw a lot of complaints about the user interface. Unfortunately, a lot of those complaints are correct. The user interface could really use some improvements. What I specifically dislike is that it feels inflexible. There is no area to group the different applications or even to rearrange the order. The layout has five home screens similar to what you find on your phone or tablet. But you cannot rearrange the order of the home screens or even the default home screens. I do not understand why TV manufacturers have decided to remain so inflexible in these aspects. It would have been nice if they would have at least included some way to at least bookmark your preferred apps. It is really a shame. Maybe in a couple more generations they will improve this.4- My final issue with the TV is its remote control. The remote is not terrible by any means but it does take a bit to get used to it. The only thing I don\u2019t like is that it does not have physical buttons to change the channels. Instead you have to press the \u201cmore\u201d button on the remote that will give you a virtual remote on the screen that will let you change to a specific channel. I had another Samsung remote control that I use it to change the channels when I decided to do so.In conclusion, would I recommend this TV to someone? I would. The main function of a TV is to obviously watch television and in this respect the TV is simply outstanding. The screen is beautiful and so is the aesthetic design of the TV. Just keep in mind that just like every other product in the market it has its flaws. In my case the 3D glasses have been a pain in the behind at times but not enough to question my decision to buy the TV. After all, I only watch 3D maybe 5% of my total time. The minor issues I had with the Wi-Fi have been few and far in between and it is probably going to vary depending on your internet connection and the equipment you have installed. If you took this long to read this review then I would like to thank you for doing so and I hope it has helped you on your search for a new TV. Also if you have any specific question please don\u2019t hesitate to ask it on the comment section and I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities.

Ok  I said I'd live with it but asked them to put this in my record in case I have problems in the future.  Well you betcha I have problems. All HDMI ports don't work.

The repair firm had no record of the ticket and when I called back Samsung to find out what's up, there was no record of the repair ticket number.

It has all the common apps including a web browser for the internet.  it can also do wireless connection to a sound bar and wireless display your tablet (also call mirror cast).  But when I start to use all these functions, I was disappointed.Things I like:1) wireless connection to a sound bar.  I have a Samsung HW-FM45C 280W Soundbar.  The blue tooth connection is excellent. every time when i turn on the TV, the sound bar is turned on automatically.  Sound quality is good too. It enable me to get ride of a bulky amplifier.Things I DO NOT like;1) The web browser experience.  Able to browser the internet on big screen TV without a computer is one of the reasons to buy this TV.  Unfortunately, The TV load the internet webpage very slowly.  I have 50 mbps wi-fi but only get 10 mbps with severe latency.  I have checked my router, cable etc. with several PCsand laptops.  All have near 50 mbps speed when no TV is involved.  After talk to Samsung support.  I finally realized that it is the TV problem.  The TV has low computing power (like computer with cheap CPU).  In other words, the slow internet can NOT be fixed.2). Wireless display tablet on big TV screen (mirror cast).  According to the comments on the web, old version of Samsung tablet can do this kind of mirror cast, but the new version (for example Samsung Tab 3) can't.  They removed this option from their new tablet.  I try to connect to 3 Non-Samsung tablets but all failed to connect to TV.My solution:In the end, I got an apple TV and using apple TV for the Mirror cast (Airplay).  When using Apple TV, the webpage loading is fast and no noticeable  latency.  The is also prove that the Samsung TV has a very slow chip.  Since I have to get an Apple TV, why i need a Smart TV?

It's located a menu/Picture/..scroll down and click on Picture Optionsand it's in that sub-menu. Yet another poorly chosen default. Love the tv though.My wife and I moved the 50 inch flat screen to the mbr and my wife was huffing and puffing afterward.So naturally she was getting prepared for the extra weight of the 65\" Samsung when she and Iwere pleasantly surprised at how much lighter it is than our 50\" which is only several years old.  Instructions for connecting the base were misleading. It told me to lay the tv face down andafter assembling the foot, attach it to the tv, but it doesn't show that you have to lift the one sideof the tv up about 10 inches to attach it. I know that everybody will figure that out, but it's irritating thatthe tech writer just ignores that part of the instruction. And about that four pronged foot. I really preferthe look of the typical solid base because we have a giant nice wood home theatre enclosure that the stainlesslook sort of clashes with. This unit looks like it should rest on a clear glass or stainless steel mount of some kind.  The setup was very easy, connecting to dish and my local internet no problem. I did not like theSmart picture thingy. If that is used to view the tv while browsing channels, then the default setting of tiny tvand giant channel icons doesn't do any good. Seems there's plenty of room on the screen to makethe picture larger and still have channel surfing. I also didn't like that it defaults to the Smart tv thingy.I didn't know how to get out of the damn thing and how to get to the regular channel display. Hitting enterworked several times, but once it didn't. I kept hitting the Enter key and the picture remained small.I went into picture setup and turned off that \"feature\". In my opinion, it should be off to start with. At thefactory, one could argue that if you make it the default, then folks will know about it and just fall in love with it. But, I prefer the lineof thought that you want the tv to work first time as seamlessly as possible to make a good impression and be easy to get up.If people want that feature, they'll search it out and figure it out. So, instead of being impressed by it, I was thoroughly annoyed by it to start with.  Second annoying thing is what I see folks are calling the soap opera effect. I did not know how to getrid of that for the first movie we watched except to set to \"movie\" mode instead of standard. But even that didn'tdo much to get rid of it. I'm going to try settings that other folks have listed in these reviews and hope they know whatthey're doing. So, our first 3d movie was essentially in soap opera mode which was the second bad first time impression.Seems to me that Samsung would have learned this a long time ago to have some simple settings that work forwhat most people like. Read these reviews and you see that they have failed miserably; not with the product but withthe marketing of it due to defaults and simple settings. Out of the box first impressions get a 2 or 3 star from me.  A small annoying thing that I still don't know if there's a fix for is that \"dink\" noise that the volume control makes. The louder you make the sound, the louder that dink noises becomes. It is extremely annoying at high \"movie volume\". I hope there's a way to disable that but I have not found it under the sound section of the tv setup. I also hope there's a way to make the volume increments less granular. Seems there was on one of my two 50 inch TV's.  About 3D. The instructions were not very clear how to set it up. The instructions didn't say to remove the plastic protectivepieces from the glasses. Ok, that's a no brainer, but it would be nice if Samsung were thorough. I found the glasses rather difficultto assemble. The sides that had to be \"clicked\" onto the front did not go in very easily. In fact, it took a great deal of force on my part to get that to happen on two of them. The glasses didn't work after registered successfully with the tv the first time. It said it had registered on the screen, but 3D didn't work. I registered again both sets of glasses, then it worked. I also didn't know of the difference between passive and active 3D. While viewing, I expected something to jump out at us like Disney or Epcot. But that never happened. Come to find out from reading these reviews, the \"jumping out at you\" effect is more a feature of passive 3D and this tv has Active 3D. Having said all this, we really enjoyed the 3D movie and the effects of it. To me, the movie had great 3D depth but the images seemed to start at the tv and go behind the tv rather than coming forward like maybe passive 3D would do. It was very, very impressive even in that darned soap opera mode. The glasses were comfortable for me, but my wife like some other reviewers found them to be very uncomfortable to wear. I'm curious how long the batteries will last and wish these were rechargeable. I hope I can find batteries that fit that are rechargeable. I was pleased that this tv came with 4 pairs and that those were not optional.  We bought the Samsung 3D blue ray player to go with this unit and since we own the Samsung 2D blue ray, I'd like to say that both interfaces for that unit are equally confusing. To this day I don't know what the logic is behind the interface that gets in my way of the DVD interface. You know; the globe icon and other stuff. I realize they want to act like a roku player, but having all that stuffbe the default like the Smart TV thingy just serves to annoy and confuse me. It is as though an engineer has worked his way into a high level product management position. He or they need to go back to the engineering department where they belong. OR, and I've seen this a number of times in my life; the ceo dictated the defaults. Well, you can't very well do anything about that. But, as a consumer, I think some of the product management/marketing decisions for this product are all wrong.  So far, the setup was relatively easy but clumsy as stated above. The picture looks good, but I suspect it will look much better after adjusting it like other folks have had to do. Just like my latent, undiscovered benevolent dictator skills; if I were running Samsung, these stupid setup problems wouldn't be a problem. You can't please everybody, but if I ran the show, most of the negative comments I see here would not be found in these reviews.

Overall it's a great TV, but if you have a dark media room the backlighting needs to be reduced to 3 or 4, otherwise you will see what appears to be little spotlights in the corners. The 3D is not as good as a Panasonic plasma, but if you play games or use it with a PC it is not subject to plasma burn-in. This is the compromise you make when choosing LCD/LED over plasma. I knew this when I purchased the TV and have no complaints. The picture quality is excellent.One pair of the 3D glasses included with the TV are defective. They have trouble syncing and cannot be turned off except by removing the battery. I called Samsung to exchange them. They took down my information and requested that I send them proof of purchase, etc. A few days later another representative called to get the model and serial number of the glasses. They told me I would receive a postal label in my email to return the glasses for exchange.  A few days went by but no email arrived. I called Samsung back and was told that the email would arrive only after the exchange was approved by executive level customer service. A few more days go by and I receive a  voicemail from another representative requesting that I call them back. I finally get another call back and am told that the email with the mailing label will be sent today. I've been told this before so I won't be holding my breath in anticipation.This is very poor customer service. My first call should have resulted in an exchange process for the glasses.

Service, I'd rate as 2 or 3 stars out of 5.  I purchased this TV (the 7050 model) from a local retailer.  It was by far the best picture available short of the 4K model (for which there is little if any programming).  The first set I took home had 6 - 8 gray bard radiating up vertically from top to bottom whenever the screen was black or letter-boxed -- VERY disturbing.  Whenever the screen was completely full of color, the picture was fine.  But when vertical bars radiate from  the bottom on a Macbook, it means the LED screen or bar at the bottom of the screen is going bad.  I called Samsung and talked with someone who appeared to be little more knowledgable than a minimum wage worker.  She instructed me to run the self diagnostics (which I'd already done).  Since the screen on the self diagnostic  picture is completely full of color, the problem did not appear.  So she said she would have someone from tech support (or some such department) call me.  When I asked how long it would take, she said 24 hours.  I told her there was no way I was going to wait 24 hours for help, OR to have a brand new set that had been plugged in for 2 days repaired.  I said if someone could call me within an hour and perhaps tell me how to change the settings or otherwise correct this problem, I'd be willing to wait.  She said it would still be 24 hours.  So I took it back to the local retailer who without any fuss exchanged it for another new (in box) set.  The new set has been working well (knock on wood) for 2 days and the picture is fantastic.  I have a smaller Samsung (last year's model) as does my son.  Both sets have performed well.  But, I am a concerned that Samsung's service is lacking.

I love everything about the TV EXCEPT the following:My biggest complaint is with batteries in the 3D glasses. I hate that. Since I do not use the 3D feature often, I do not keep the batteries in the glasses, but rather install them before use. And then I have to get the glasses turned on before I can use them. I really wish I had purchased a TV with passive glasses. Also - and this is huge - the glasses need to \"turn on\" when viewing 3D content and there is a delay of a couple seconds - and this is disconcerting - especially when switching between 2D and 3D content. Really - for me this is a reason I would have purchased a different model TV.Second biggest complaint is that the menu system is overly complicated - too many features most of which will not be used. OK for me ( I have a masters in EE), but my wife will never be able to operate the thing. I want to be able to turn it on, pick a source (cable / DVD / AmazonTV / USB / etc.) and go. But they are trying so hard to sell content that it offers a TON of options and these make is so complicated that many will never be able to use it. I purchased the Samsung DVD player to go with the TV and I love that it switched to DVD automatically as soon as I insert a DVD into the DVD slot. Not sure how the TV knows, but maybe my wife will have a chance with this.But then there is the problem that the menus for the TV and the DVD player are the same and I sometimes don't know which I am looking at on the TV screen. I am sitting there clicking the TV remote, but looking at the DVD remote. Actually, I think that both remotes are supposed to work with both units, but I have not taken the time to figure this all out.When I try to access Netflix using the TV (which is cool, i admit), there is a significant wait (15-30 seconds?) for the Netflix application to load, I could also run Netflix from the Samsung DVD player which also makes me wait. So I purchased an Amazon Fire TV unit which does NOT make we wait - at least not after the first time. Also, Roku does not make we wait. Anyway, here are 4 ways for me to watch Netflix on my system - and my wife is supposed to understand this ? ? ? I think I will have to make up  laminated operating instructions for her. And she is a VERY smart woman - senior business executive, but not patient with tech.I have a Fuji 3D camera. The TV knows how to handle the 3D photos from this camera and this is great, but I see a noticeable flicker when viewing them, but I can live with this, but why can't it be as beautiful as when viewing a Blue-Ray 3D DVD?? Also, it will not display the 3D videos taken by the camera without first converting them to a different format.So mostly I am very happy with the TV - except that I wish I had purchased a TV that uses passive glasses rather than active glasses.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Crappy remote", "Author": "me", "ReviewID": "R2HVYQXJ4UCDJ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love this TV.

By far the best picture quality of any TV we've owned. We have a 55\" Samsung UN55C7100 in our living room. I\u2019ve had it for over 5 years. No problems. The picture still looks perfect.We bought a new house with a basement and decide to make the basement space an entertainment room/theater room/play room. It's dark down there. Because of the size we decided to we were looking for a 75 - 80 inch TV. We looked at all our option and really came down to the Sharp 3-D 240hz 80\". the 2013 757U model. The picture was ok. I could live with it because of the price at the time $4k. This TV was also edge lit but did not offer local dimming (or micro dimming as Samsung calls it). Once we got into watching DARK movies in a DARK room, we quickly realized that \"CLOUDING\" and \"FLASH LIGHTING\" was going to be an issue. Sharp admitted to us that it was normal for their panels, and there was nothing they can do or any changes to the setting that will correct this. So the TV went back. H.H. Gregg was kind enough to let us exchange the TV for the UN75F7100, which was slightly smaller, but was also 240 Hz, 3-D, edge lit, BUT it included micro/local dimming. So we bought the Samsung for $4k.After having the for a couple months, watching all types of movies, and changing many of the settings, I realized that clouding was also prevalent on this TV.Samsung manufacturers some of their panels, and they have other companies, like Sharp, manufacturers some for them as well. There are a few version of the 75\" panel that Samsung uses for this TV. TH01, which is supposedly made by Samsung in Mexico, is the most common. UH01 is another, supposedly made by Sharp. There's talk of TH02 and UH02's out there, which may be the updated version of the problem panel's we're about to discuss.So I spent a month playing the panel lottery (exchanging TV's until you get a good panel). Keep in mind I have the TV in the basement, which dark and normally only watch the TV down there at night, so I have it in the perfect parameters for clouding to be exposed.Before I proceed, know that the 7100 models and above have micro dimming which should adjust the dimming and contrast uniformly across the panel. BUT...big BUT, micro dimming only works on the Dynamic, Standard, and Natural setting. Although MOVIE mode give you the most accurately calibrated colors that makes you say \"WOW\u2026what an amazing TV\", it does not turn the micro dimming on. In my opinion, this was a horrible mistake by Samsung.My first panel was TH01, the clouding and flash lighting out of the corners was horrible. Even turning the back light down to zero would not eliminate the clouding. Dynamic, Natural and Standard did not fix it. Samsung had agreed to replace the entire panel, but with the TV being 2 weeks old, and still under the store exchange warranty, I decided to replace it with a new model before letting a technician rip the TV apart.I replaced it with a second set, also a TH01. This panel was remarkably better. Although it had clouding at the factory settings, turning the back light down to a 10 made it barely visible. On Dynamic, Standard or Natural, the backlight is almost nonexistent with the exception of minor amount at the bottom left corner and even less on the top right corner. But this panel up close shows what appears to be black pressure point patches on the top left, top center, and top right corner. You have to be standing within a foot of the panel while it\u2019s on and tuned to a black screen. But seriously, who watches TV like that. My couch is 10 feet back, and when will I ever stare at a black screen for more than a second.Regardless, I called H.H. Gregg and had them send another TV. This one was a UH01 panel. This time, I had them set up the TV on the floor and look at both screens side by side. This UH01 had more clouding at factory setting then my second set. So they left my second TH01 set and took back the third UH01 set.Then I decided to visit the two local H.H. Greggs in my area and look at the floor models. The one from the store I bought it at was much worse. Keep in mind that the showroom is lit up and nowhere near as dark as my basement, and the floor model was bad. Even in a lit room.Went to the next H.H. Gregg and looked at their floor model. This one looked perfect (in a lit room). This was also a TH01. The floor manager agreed to let me buy the floor model, take it home and compare it to my current one, so I did.This one in the dark had clouding as well, pretty much on the entire left side, top to bottom. The bottom right corner had a white streak of light like the corner of the panel was pinched by a screw or something. On all 4 settings, the clouding performed like my current (the 2nd) set. I would say just little more clouding, but not much. The picture quality was much better though. It seemed to a bit clearer and a lot more calibrated. But because the clouding was slightly worse, and I hadn't calibrated mine (the second set) yet, I returned the 4th set back to the store.I have come to the conclusion that every single set at 75 inches is going to have some clouding; the question is which one has the least. The black pressure points suck, but I can\u2019t see them when I'm watching TV. And if I\u2019m watching a dark movie, I flip to Natural Mode to turn micro dimming on and the clouding goes away. I personally haven't seen a UH02 panel, but I'm extremely interested in viewing one. I hear it's the premier panel. That is probably what Samsung reserves for the UN75F8000 series, which is probably what the extra $2,000 buys you, a uniformed panel.I can't decide what I want to do next. Call Samsung and have them replace the panel or live with it. I\u2019m truly exhausted and can't image having to dismount the TV again and again since it is wall mounted.So I'm giving it 5 stars for the picture quality being the most amazing of any other brand. But I'm taking 1 star away for clouding/flash lighting, and taking 3 stars away because I'm so frustrated that I spent $4,000 on a TV and it doesn't look like a $4,000 TV. But the MSRP is like $6,000, and it sell for like $5,000, seriously Samsung?I would not recommend this TV to anyone AT this time. If I had to do over, I wait another year or two and see what new technologies and TV's are released in the 75 - 80 inch range. 4k resolution TV are hitting the market so fast featuring local/micro dimming and major advancement in lighting technology.Since it has been over 90 days since I bought the original TV, I can't return this one, but the store will let me exchange it. But how many times do I have to keep doing this.I'm kind of lost at this point, and sadly, the customer service reps at Samsung don't speak English very well and don\u2019t really understand the technology side of it. They just run the picture test mode and verify that there\u2019s a uniformed picture. But the test picture they use a bight shot of kids playing at the beach. Nothing that will ever show the darkness flaws on the screen.Bottom Line: If you watch TV in a lit room, and don't watch dark movies like \"The Dark Knight\", \"The Purge\", \"Star Trek into Darkness\", or any movie with a prolonged dark scene, then get it.If you want see an perfectly amazing dark picture from a TV that retails for $5,000.

He really took the work out of setting it up for the rest of us.......bless his heart.

It even has FM capabilities and  It has the wireless rear speakers. Sweet system. I had the Geek Squad set it up and was glad I paid the money to do everything. Along with the above, I got theSAMSUNG VG-KBD2000/ZA keyboard to use with my internet, and I also purchased a Logitech Harmony ONE. Again, they came and set up everything ( for a fee) made sure it all worked properly, got my network set up and running, tested a NETFLIX movie....... and also set up the picture colors, contrast, sharpness etc. They programmed the Logitech where I only need 1 remote to work the Directv receiver, the Samsung TV, the Samsung BluRay /audio receiver. They also set it up to where I can have the TV sound only or switch to the 5.1 Surround Sound with one touch. I got rid of 3 remotes.But getting back to the TV.......  IMHO,I couldn't be more pleased and felt it's well worth the money.Aug 8, 2013 update..........TV still outstanding. No problems at all.  I just wanted to let people know that if you have Directv, it's remote will work with this Samsung model. The code I entered to pair the TV with the remote was \"10812\".

Only thing the Satellite remote won't do is get you to the TV's SMART HUB. So, for those who HATE the \"smart remote\" that comes with this TV....and don't want to spend $$$ for the Logitech Harmony, you can set up your Directv remote and use it like you always have.October 17, 2013Still in awe of the TV.  I have experimented with the settings quite a bit and made sure I downloaded the latest software... version 1113.  Even though I have AUTO UPDATE selected to ON.........I FIND I HAVE TO MANUALLY DO IT.  It does take time and once you decide to do the update, you're done watching TV until it loads. Depending on your speeds, this could take SEVERAL HOURS ( my WiFi speed is less than 1MB). I do the updates when I go to bed.  After the update is completed, the TV shuts off and turns back on all by itself.I found keeping my PICTURE MODE set to \"MOVIE\"  seemed to put a haze or dullness over most of the TV shows I watch......so I've changed it to \"STANDARD\" OR \"NATURAL\"..... and depending on the network broadcasts, sometimes \"DYNAMIC\".  The \"Standard\" setting really took away that dullness look and made the reds and other colors pop.  Under Advanced settings, I have my Dynamic contrast set to Medium, Black Tone set to Dark.  Under Picture Options I have the Color Tone set to Standard, Auto Motion Plus  set to Clear and Cinema Black to Off.  Film mode is set to Auto 2, Digital Clean View and MPEG Noise Filter are both set to AUTO.I must comment that every network and commercials that come on seems to use their own colors and sometimes the flesh colors are way off, but then the commercial ends and it goes back to normal.  Naturally, each person has their own preferences in their picture, so experiment. Just remember what numbers and setting you had before you start tweaking.

Not only does it no longer come with a keyboard so you have to use arrows to find every individual letter (older models had a keyboard on the back of the remote), but it also has a really stupid touch screen track pad that you will accidentally touch about 50x a day which will drain the battery at an excessive rate.

I have since had to refuse delivery on 3 of these because of dead pixels.  Each screen had exactly one dead pixel.  This leads me to suspect that Samsung sorts the screens by the number of dead pixels and assigns them to a model.  I would suspect that the 8000 series gets the best screens and screen quality goes down from there.Maybe I'm being picky, but I think that $2000 TV's should should come from the factory with exactly zero dead pixels.  Don't get me wrong, I still think that Samsung produces great LCD screens.  The picture looks fantastic on these screens.  I just can't see myself spending the next 4-5 years staring at this TV, playing spot the dead pixel.  I'd even try to have another set delivered if I thought I would get one without any dead pixels.

One reason for choosing the Samsung UN60F7100 TV was access to both Netflix and Amazon Instant Video, both of which have dedicated buttons on the remote. Amazon requires a 5-digit code from the TV. That proved difficult to obtain. Contact with tech support revealed that to use either Netflix or Amazon Instant Video, one absolutely must create a Samsung account and set up the Smart Hub. The two documents one must agree to appear to be very intrusive. One must read them line by line - not page by page and there's no scanning or skipping portions of no concern. One must agree that all information, including credit card #, name, address, phone, etc. (not sure about Wi-Fi password) can be transmitted internationally and used by anyone Samsung deals with. There was no indication how long the docs were or what percentage I'd read.  I lost patience after a few screens and perhaps a hundred button pushes. I couldn't find them on Samsung's website or with a quick web search.Next, tech support. Tech support was very slow and uncertain, repeating to me questions I'd already answered, with long pauses to research how to set up Amazon. \"Try unplugging the set and waiting 30 seconds.\"I found online documentation to be lengthy and difficult to read and search. There is help on the TV, but the crappy remote is required to navigate it. Speaking of which, the touchy little touch pad on the remote is required to navigate menus for common and frequent actions such as changing the picture size or activating closed captioning.The web browser is slow to render and scroll, difficult to navigate and basically useless. Unless the remote is on a solid table, pressing the center of the touch pad to select something causes the cursor to jump off target so that you select something else and have to back up and try again. Then there's the difficulty of typing with it on the TV's virtual keyboard. An old wired keyboard helped, but the touch pad was the last straw for web browsing.The TV *is* lightweight, attractive and loaded with features. I have no complaints about the picture, but admittedly I'm not very picky about picture quality. I found recommended settings on the web, augmented by the THX setup from a Blu-Ray disc. Here too, the remote is irritating. One swipe on the touch pad changes only a few points on a hundred point scale, so setting things like contrast and sharpness takes longer than necessary. The screen is quite mirror-like but ok in our room. A bit of dark tape over the shiny X-stand reduced reflections from it. I see some flat black paint in its future.So why keep the TV? I had resigned myself to re-boxing it and returning it, but my spouse counseled otherwise. Our second choice Sony KDL-55W900A is five inches smaller and more expensive, plus this was the second UN60F7100 we'd unboxed and set up. The first unit arrived DOA and had to be exchanged. Neither of us looked forward to a third installation. Samsung 1, users 0.Ultimately, we ignored all of Samsung's smart features, browser, etc. It's now just a nice display with an irritating remote. Hopefully \"there's an app for that.\" We accessed Amazon Instant Video on the PlayStation 3 instead, where setup was easy. Even including a system update, PlayStation account setup and Amazon app download, the PS3 was far easier and faster to use than the Samsung. Netflix appears to be similar. The PS3/Amazon interface is zippy and intuitive. I wish I'd chosen that path initially. Roku would have been third choice. If you value your time (they're not making more of that), as I do, perhaps it's worth looking beyond this Samsung UN60F7100 TV. Hope that's useful.It turned out that the PS3 remote handles all the basic TV functions except 3D and does so more easily and quickly than the touch pad remote.Three months later, I like the TV less - too much nannying. The TV won't let me step past an input whose source has recently powered off until I respond to a prompt - this while trying to select a different input whose source is on. Troubleshooting a loose connection with hands buried in a maze of wires is similarly irritating. Also, the TV shuts itself off inexplicably, typically while the DVR is paused for a few moments. Nothing in the setup seems to prevent this.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "Jimmie Dunigan", "ReviewID": "R3VUHGTG0ZP9LW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Word cannot say what a great picture this TV has. 3D is unbelievable and we are enjoying it very much.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the features and picture however,...GET AN EXTENDED WARRANTY!!!", "Author": "S.

My review however, is to offer advice about getting an extended warranty using my case(s) as an example.I've owned a previous Samsung Plasma TV and had it for under 2 years when it developed magenta banding across the screen. (I even wrote a review about it under Samsung PN58C500.) Since it was out of warranty by only a few months mind you, I was out of luck and had to pay for repairs out of pocket. The repairman said it would cost $$$ to get the panel fixed so basically $1800 went down the drain. We vowed NEVER to get another Samsung again. We went shopping for a new TV to replace it and saw this baby. Even though my husband and I swore off Samsung because of the issues with our plasma TV, we fell in love with it because the picture looked awesome compared to the other TVs in the store. We thought long and hard about it, and in the end decided to give Samsung another try.We purchased the UN65F7100 TV on 8/19/13. About 8 days later, my son was watching it when it suddenly turned off, made a loud buzzing sound, started smelling like burnt something, and now will no longer turn on. This TV is 8 days old!!! It's still under the manufacturer's warranty obviously, but given our past 2 circumstances with Samsung, I would advise anyone: DO NOT PURCHASE A SAMSUNG TV WITHOUT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY. I cannot emphasize this enough. The reliability of these expensive TV's are terrible, and doing a simple Google search will show you that an extended warranty is well worth the investment. We've decided to get a 4 year warranty on top of the existing one year manufacturer's warranty because we have little faith in the longevity of any Samsung TV.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung TV's have serious problems.", "Author": "Kris \"Mountain Wizard\"", "ReviewID": "R2L2U3UZWW7NW0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am having issues with a 14 month old Samsung that cost $3000.It is a 65\" LCD LED 3 D Samsung.I am in the Costco extended warranty.

As a gauge I used the customers remarks as a guide to which one I should get.  Some of the early models with all the toys had problems but not this on.  It is a 65 inch but still fit in my cabinet just right.  This picture is so great it almost looks like 3d with out turning on that feature on for a 2d broadcast.

Unlike some smart TV's it has a browser that you can go anywhere on the internet that you can like a smart phone.  It has more then one tab on the browser so if you get a pop up it is easy to just close the new tab that jumped up at you.  Wired is best using the RJ45 provided but I am close enough to my router that I skipped running the wire to get to it.  Works great on just WIFI.  The price dropped another $300 after I got it and was just outside of the the ability to get a refund on the cheaper price but was still happy at the price I did buy it for.  They did as they said and gave me back 2% on the cost which is what they are doing for everyone.  You can use that money to get a deal on your first 3d Blue ray movie.

I had to use the Netflix app on my bluray player instead... bummer... and a disappointment.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I have never disliked a TV until NOW", "Author": "thegoddess", "ReviewID": "R1D00LURHLDG5Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned Sony's and Panasonic's, both Plasma's, LED's and LCD's and never before have I disliked a TV until now. I currently use a Sony Bravia in my living room and bought this Samsung TV for my bedroom. I bought this TV to watch post surgery knowing I would be in bed for several weeks. While I had 30 days to return the TV, I was unfortunately on crutches for 2 months after surgery and just couldn't manage it.While TV shows look great on this Samsung, the first problem I noticed was that films did not look like films. I played several movies from Netflix and while the movies were incredibly sharp, movies (films) looked like video footage, specifically like a daytime soap, that is the movies were too bright and action scenes seemed unnatural due to the built in Clear Motion Rate (CMR) technology. Additionally, black tones were not black. I spent hours going through the settings trying to make color/picture adjustments and did eventually get the grey black tones much darker but there are no settings I could find to get around the CMR. Recently, while comparing a Samsung to a Sony in Best Buy, side by side, it was apparent that the Samsung's colors were washed out and diluted and not nearly as rich as on the Sony so my point is even with picture color adjustments I personally do not believe the color is as good as Sony's due to a lack of depth and or intensity.My second complaint is the interface of the apps. Personally I watch Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Hula, Vudu, Blockbuster, YouTube, etc and FYI it is not Netflix that makes the final decision on how an app and its interface will function/appear, as each TV manufacturer redesigns these apps; and it seems Samsung took quite a bit of liberty herein. To sum it up I hate the Netflix-Samsung interface on this TV and the YouTube interface is even worst, but that would require a whole other in-depth review just to discuss, suffice to say the alpha numeric keypad, interface, in YouTube is designed very poorly so that the alphabet is in one horizontal row from A-Z meaning you must use your thumb/finger on the trackpad of the remote to navigate back and forth along one long row rather than have rows and columns of letters, a cube, as is the interface on YouTube-Apple TV and Netflix-Apple TV and on my Sony Blu-ray; plus there are a plethora of other Netflix-Samsung interface issues to do with \"search\" and \"categories\", but as to what Netflix designed and to what Samsung designed I don't know, I just know that the Samsung interface for Netflix is totally different to my Sony Blu-ray and Apple TV.I also hate the remote control itself. It is the dumbest remote ever. Samsung placed the \"mute\" button on the left side of the remote so each time you pick it up, your hand accidentally mutes the TV. I have other remotes for other systems and other designers have cleverly placed the \"light\" button on the left side, to back-light the buttons/keypad so that when you pick up the remote in the dark you FIRSTLY can easily find/feel the light button...in order to see the keypad, but this Samsung remote is so dumb you can't even get to the light button in the dark without accidentally hitting some other another button. Then again if you do manage to find the light button in the dark there is not even enough back-light to see/read what the keys are and whats more is that the back-light only stays on about 5 seconds, so it is useless. I also accidentally hit the trackpad when just attempting to pick up the remote and often times it will either stop my movie or exit me from the movie when all I wanted to do is adjust the volume or add CC. The voice recognition feature would be great if it worked but it takes me more time to use it than to type out my searches even with the exhausting repetitive thumb/finger swiping motion which literally strains my fingers.I also tried to sync a bluetooth keyboard to the TV but my keyboard would not sync so I guess wireless Apple Keyboards are not compatible; so the point is that Samsung sells a keyboard for $99, I guess that's about the only one thats compatible. Also, in the last 6 months this TV as twice wiped out all \"my apps\" and \"pairing\" to Netflix and Amazon Prime. Lately I have had so much trouble with the TV that I reset it with Samsung's remote management which is a brilliant service and was helpful after finally getting to someone who could give tech support, unfortunately towards the end, the call dropped and that support call was never finalized, so I can't say I was totally satisfied with it since the support person had my number and could have called me back to complete the session.Lastly I am not a fan of Active 3D and pretty mad at myself for buying a TV with active rather than passive 3D. Active 3D glasses require a battery and are heavier and as I already were prescription eyeglasses I cannot comfortably wear the Active 3D glasses and my eyeglasses, suffice to say the 3D glasses are very uncomfortable! A friend of mine purchased some Sony passive 3D glasses and they were extremely lightweight and extremely comfortable even with my prescription glasses.In the end I don't know of anyone who goes to a store to shop for a TV and say's ok I need to focus on how the remote looks and works and how the 3D glasses fit, no one even looks at those; you worry about the technical specs, the refresh rate, the resolution, the look of the TV, the price, the warranty, etc, but from now on I will be wanting to see every part and accessory before buying a TV and I will want to see its interface to apps.

A representative of a common carrier will deliver your TV to any room suitable for testing, unpack it, ensure that it is working properly to guarantee no damage occurred during transportation, and dispose of all packaging material. \"What happened is that I scheduled the delivery time (online) with CEVA, their shipping company, for Aug 28th between 3 and 6pm and arranged to get home early from work.  Unfortunately, the TV was delivered sometime in the morning (before 12noon of the same date).when I was not home.  The delivery men got the doorman to sign for the TV and then high-tailed it out of the building.  I did call Amazon (got an actual phone number through Google) and reached a live person who said that I needed to speak to the customer service team for large appliances.  She offered to transfer me and promptly lost the call.Rather then get even more frustrated, I dragged the 60\" TV into my unit (I am on the 1st floor so could have been worse), and got it set up, which was a pain because of the bulk and took me about 90 minutes.I then contacted Amazon customer service by e-mail, and to Amazon's credit, they sent a peronalized (not canned) response indicating that they would deal with the carrier directly and also that they would credit back a  small amount to my charge card to make up for the inconvenience.  So I do commend them on the service recovery.As to the TV, outstanding picture and features - and my wife loves the design.  The TV does have voice response - which is a tad confusing, but very happy with the purchase.The TV is great - based upon 30 min of use - but the service was disappointing.

Pilot sucks and Amazon should reconsider their relationship with them.Disregard all of the aforementioned things about the TV being awesome. It failed catastrophically tonight.

The set continually failed to recognize my home theater system, in part, because it redirected the HDMI input automatically to the wrong input with no ability to change.  Finally, I connected the DirecTV receiver directly to the TV and bypassed the Home Theater System as the only to get the TV to continually recognize the DirecTV receiver.
