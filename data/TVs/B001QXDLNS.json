{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Thanks Amazon for the Speedy Delivery", "Author": "Trend \"jewelry nut\"", "ReviewID": "R4ICAR7L1ROFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my son for Christmas. He wanted a 19\" flat screen. I didn't relish spending 300. to 350., so I kept putting off purchasing. I'm glad I did. I saw this at Amazon for such a good price, I snapped it up, but it was so close to Christmas, I didn't think I would receive it in time.  I did. Thank you, Amazon. The picture quality is awesome and sound is excellent. It looks great and has easy set up.  The only thing I would change, the picture doesn't cover the entire screen. There is a 1 1/2\" to 2\" black border on either side, so the picture is really only about 15\". This is the first LCD TV I've purchased, so I don't know if this is standard. Still, it deserves  5 stars. The picture quality is crystal clear and the definition is so good, you can actually see the individual strains of hair, on the images on screen. UPDATE: While checking out the TV and it's working order, I found it does go full screen. On the remote, there is a \"format\" button...press that and you'll be prompted to choose your desired screen.  There are three or four options available for the screen appearance and size. There is absolutely no picture distortion and this is one the the simplest remotes to operate.My local Walgreens is selling off brand, 15\" flat screens, for 179.00. This is an excellent buy. I highly recommend. Thanks again, Amazon.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for small spaces", "Author": "J.

She doesn't have a lot of space, but she needed something a little bigger then her old 15\" LCD.  The best thing about this LCD is that it is simple and easy to use.  The buttons on the remote are well laid out and are logical.  If you are just looking for a simple LCD, then this is it.  If you care about audio quality, you need to hook it up to a separate receiver.  So simplicity is the key work here.", "Date": "September 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "shop around", "Author": "Heidi L.

This Magnavox LCD TV had exactly that at a price that was affordable.  The earphone jack is located on the side of the TV panel which made it easily accessible to her. Other TV models, if they had an earphone jack, were located in the back of the unit.

The picture wasn't the best, but for the price I paid, I didn't expect the best picture.  I did, however, expect that the TV would work for longer then a week, which it did not.  It would not turn on. I tried different outlets.  It still did not work.  So, I sent it back which was quite easy.
