It's a pretty good tv. I have my Comcast cable plugged right into the analog (NTSC) connection without a cable box. Searching for the channels didn't take too long, and even the sometimes hard to receive stations, channels 5 and 6 were also found.This TV is QAM compatible. So, if your cable provider broadcasts your local channels over clear QAM, this tuner can receive them. QAM works nicely for me. The HD quality on the ATSC tuner is noticeably better than standard definition.The only drawback I can think of is the narrow viewing angle of the set. If you're even a little off to the side the image fades noticeably, especially with skin tones.", "Date": "June 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "DP26746 *Warning-don't do it*", "Author": "W.

It's a shame that a company will stake there reputation on a product like this and not stand behind it. They will lose my business for the next 30 years and wonder why they went the way of the Yugo.

We wanted a lowish-priced television, and figured that the HDTV route was the way to go, since they're not that much more expensive. I got this for $387 at Walmart. I'll preface this by saying that I didn't know (and don't know) much about the HD world, nor about HDTVs or electronics in general. I'm a graphic designer, though, so I'm picky about resolution and color. My impressions so far:1. The set-up isn't intuitive for someone who doesn't know much about televisions. I think that the info included could have been more comprehensive, particularly in explaining the interfacing with cable boxes. I know this isn't really the TV maker's responsibility, but explaining the difference between 720p and whatever else would be very helpful. The cable company eventually explained everything to me.2. This has nothing to do with THIS TV, but with 16:9 HDTVs in general: note that most cable channels are going to be centered square in the middle of the screen, so you don't really get the full 26 inches, because most TV isn't broadcast in wide screen.3. With my non-HD cable box, the picture was really bad. Really bad. Ghosting, pixels, and notably worse than my regular old non-HDTV. With the HD cable box, the HD channels are fabulous, but I still think the regular channel pictures looked better on the non-HDTV. Not a huge difference, and worth it for the fabulous HD picture, but notable nevertheless.4. The HD picture is very nice and contrasty and bright, compared to the others I've seen in the store. I don't notice any real problem with the viewing angle either. The picture DOES seem to be a little bit red, and messing with the color controls doesn't seem to do very much at all. I wish there were better color control.Maybe this will help an HDTV dummy like me. I'm satisfied with the TV. It's not the best TV I've ever seen, but I got it for what I think is a very reasonable price. And I think many of my gripes may just be that \"regular\" non-HD channels are smaller and less clear on this TV than they were on my square regular non-HD set.", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "excellent quality & ellegant appearance", "Author": "katheleen", "ReviewID": "RD76AQ5F7IEQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this model in Wal-Mart for $448, after owning a standard Sanyo TV set and being very satisfied with it.The LCD HD model also appealed to me with its elegant appearance of fine proportions and matt-black finish. Although lowest in price, the Sanyo model looked so much better than all expensive ones - with their metallic or glossy bodies. Easy to assemble and connect, it also shows a very satisfying quality of picture, even with analog cable. It is superb when viewing DVDs and those few digital programming accessible. Although it is recommended by the manufacturer, I don't think, I really need to upgrade my analog cable service to HD.", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for!!!", "Author": "A.

It has been in 2 different living rooms and will soon be headed for our den and has never had a problem. The picture quality is good; my only criticism would be that the contrast and brightness are a little lacking when using the HDMI connection, especially with a BluRay player, but I suppose that could be as much the BluRay player's fault as the TV's. Setting the picture mode to automatic, or manually increasing the brightness somewhat, does help a little. The sound quality is good and volume is ample; not top of the line, but competitive with similar models.

I have had it for 5 years and it is almost as good as the day I was gifted it. The picture quality does not compare to a better brand that runs 720p, but you won't notice unless you spend a lot of time around nicer TVs. The only technical issue I've had with it is that for some reason the HDMI inputs produce a crackling sound when a loud noise, like an explosion, though in my experience component cables work just as well.

Wow!  It has been a long time.  I purchased this TV at Wally World.  This TV was still over $700 with my friend's Wally World employee discount.  That tells you how much the price of this TV has dropped over the years.  Now you can get this TV for under 300 dollars.  I can tell you that my TV still works.  It works wonderfully.  I would like to get a bigger, more awesome, 40+ inch 120hz television, but I am too cheap to do so.  I really loved watching HD cable with the TV, but HD is too expensive.  I already told you I am cheap.  Normal TV looks OK with this TV.  I have had this TV for so long, I don't have any comparison in the quality of picture to my previous TV.To all the Naysayers.  My TV has not gone out (I never purchased a warranty for this TV) as of 2/11/11.  I also don't get the reds that I hear others talking about.  I am positive, there are much better sets out there in the world, but when I got this TV in 2006, I was the coolest man on the block.  This TV has lasted me almost 5 years.
