The pro reviews from CNET and others were good, if a little tepid.  But I did not want a plasma TV, as they are much heavier, thicker and use several times more electricity to deliver a picture.  The reviews passed off these details, focusing solely on picture quality.  There's only one thing I can say definitively about our new TV: if you're watching it from either side, you don't get a great picture.  But if you watch from the front (and I assume you do) the picture can be anything from terrible to magnificent.The default settings are terrible.  In particular, there's some sort of \"smoothing\" or \"anti-judder\" effect that is on by default, and which makes everything look ... well, smooth.  Life ain't smooth.  I think this is what is sometimes referred to as the \"soap opera effect\".  It's bizarre and disturbing.  Turn it off.  Oddly, it's in the Advanced settings.The other default setting was \"normal\" picture setting -- \"cinema\" was a lot closer, with far less blue and unnaturally brilliant settings which doubtless look great when compared to the other TVs on parade at Best Buy, but tend to look like a cheap hooker when you get back to the room.  The preceding is a metaphor, or perhaps a simile.  But I do not know what a cheap hooker looks like when you get back to the room.  I don't know what any hooker looks like when you get back to the room.  All I know is that if, on TV you see a cheap hooker (regardless of his or her context), this TV will make all people look like that unless you make a few adjustments.  Sadly, there's no \"anti-cheap-hooker\" setting.After a few days and some family discussion, we came to find a set of settings that work for us.  And damn, they look good!  The blacks are black, the contrast is amazing, the definition is great, and the picture is totally awesome.  More importantly (because I think great picture is likely possible with all TVs of this size and type) this TV has a really thin bezel, so it's all picture, and no dazzle to interfere with the styling of your living room.  I am sure you could pay twice as much to get some other specs that sound fantastic, but having worked for a company that reviewed TVs (several years ago) I know that pretty much all of the features that you feel like are worth paying extra for are ones you'll never use or notice, and this is certainly the case for the ones the other TVs this one competes with \"have\".  Don't waste your money -- great deal, just spend some quality time turning off all the BS settings that are turned on to make a TV look good in the showroom and use ones that make it look great where you watch.

I have absolutely no regrets now after having it for a few weeks.The menu, set up and remote control are simple to get used to.  Once you turn the LED on the color options need to be adjusted to your liking. I liked the fact that this model has a small one inch frame around the screen as opposed to competing brands like LG that had a 1-1/2 to 2\" frame.This LED is fairly lightweight and I was able to mount on the wall.  I would definitely not mount it to a sheet rock wall unless you have a solid wood frame to bold into.I watched football last night and the images were great. I also watched the Olympics.  No shadowing or other problems that customers have complained about with cheaper LED models.

It has a lot of built in adjustments so you can adjust it to what you like. I use it mostly with my Playstation 3 to play video games and watch movies, so the big thing for me was to not get the the \"soap opera effect\" when watching film based content(Blu-ray or dvd). Lucky for me is that I can either turn on game mode or just turn off the auto-motion plus when watching movies. Action scenes still look great even with auto-motion plus turned off.  I haven't hooked it up to HD cable yet, so I don't know how it is when watching sports. The sound is pretty good if you want to use the TV speakers, however I needed a little more punch.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "jav", "ReviewID": "R11T497KCX9AVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this television about a month ago and was waiting to write a review until after I had taken it for a spin.  As a viewer my primary sources of entertainment are movies, netflix, tv shows and ps3.  To keep things easy I will break my review down into those categories.1.  Movies and Netflix-  Having my PS3 hooked up has done wonders for my movie viewing experience.  Blu Ray movies are crisp and clear, I watched Avengers on my first night, after having watched it a few weeks back on my old 720p 60 hz television, and the difference is like night and day.  Blacks are rich and inky, no grey shading that I can see, which was one of my biggest concerns after reading CNET's review, which sad the blacks were \"gray and muted,\" or something to that effect.  I'm not sure what settings they had it on but the blacks are amazing in my opinion.  Turn on Movie mode in the audio section (another worry per reviews) and you can get audio that will sound great in a small or medium sized room, honestly I don't know how it would sound in a big room but at that point i'm sure you would have a sound system.  Anyone who says the audio is not good enough must be looking for something that I don't know to look for, maybe the bass could be higher but for a tv the sound is amazing.  Now alot of people have talked about the \"soap opera effect\" and yes this can be a bit jarring in the beginning, but after tweaking it the effects can be lessened and improved significantly.  Netflix displays very well, i'm not sure if everything is set to 1080p in netflix land but most of the pictures are very impressive and once again the audio and the blacks hold up very well.2.  Television shows-  It's all about  the signal coming in, we all know that there are not many programs broadcasting in 1080p from cable or satellite, unfortunately the technology has not caught up to current users.  With that being said the picture on television shows is quite stunning.  I watch alot of hockey and the picture during the games is great, the detail is very accurate and the action flows smoothly with very little pixilization.  Now a word of warning, if you do not have HDMI hooked up or are only running standard cable the picture quality will be dependent on the quality of the signal.  I have had very few issues with watching the standard deff fox, cbs, abc just to see what they looked like, but the CW which apparently is now broadcast in HD where I am at, the picture quality is way below standard as compared to other SD and HD channels.  I love the show archer and I see a ton of pixilization during the broadcast, but in all honesty I feel that this is a problem with the signal because i'll watch Supernatural on netflix and not see any of the problems that is present with the channel on television.3.  PS3-  I've only played two games since buying this television, Crysis 3 and Tomb Raider.  Honestly I was very disappointed with Crysis 3 and it's graphics, I would see jagged edges, blurred colors and other issues.  This made me very worried.  This week I got Tomb Raider and all my fears were put to rest, the picture on this game is STUNNING.  It feels like I am watching a movie while playing the game, the scenery, the colors, the blacks are all on point and look amazing, the fast action doesn't blur or slow down, all in all the picture is beyond my wildest dreams.  In all honesty I have heard alot of people complain about Crysis and the graphics, it is built for PC and then ported so I feel that this is the issue with the game on console.In addition i've watched several Blu Ray concert's and the picture and audio on those are amazing as well, well above my expectations.There are a few draw backs.1.  Not alot of hookups- It isn't an issue for me becuase i'm only running t he ps3 and my box but I can see how people who might have a HTIB or an X-box in addition may be a bit frustrated.2.  Apparently it will not do 5.1 audio-  Keep this in mind when you are adding a home theater, there are several sites or amazon reviews that will point you in the right direction.3.  It does take a bit of tweaking to get the picture exactly right.  Out of  the box the picture is good but not nearly what it could be.  I would recommend setting it to Standard and building your settings around that, that's the option me and several other reviewers are using.  Of course if you see the picture after setting it up to someone else's specs and don't like it then adjust it to what you like, one person's awesome picture might be anothers \"ok\" picture.All in all I am extremely happy with my purchase, the television has exceeded all of my expectations.  On a separate note, if you have prime or want to pay extra for the shipping I would highly recommend it.  I got free super savers shipping and though it arrived on time I do feel that they were not rushing to get it to me any quicker.

I love Amazon Prime! Two day shipping on most of the stuff I buy and free Prime streaming movies for a reasonable yearly fee.ProsThe TV connected with my Dish TV Satellite with no problems and has a very good picture. The TV is very light and easy to set up. It has 2 Hdmi connectors and one set of Component connectors. If you are looking for a no frills TV at a pretty good price this is a good choice.Cons - The TV has only one button on it and it is somewhat hidden underneath the TV. This is the \"ON\" button. I say \"On\" because it turns the Tv on but repeatedly pressing the button does not turn the TV off. If your remote breaks or you lose it, you may have a hard time switching sources. This TV has very limited connectors. It does not have any of the older AV (Red/Yellow/Green) connectors so if you have an older DVD Player or VCR with only these connectors you are going to be disappointed. Another problem I have with both Samsung Tvs that I own is the screws that attach the base to the TV are recessed. We need to take the base off the TV when we load it in our vehicle and the screws are very difficult to remove. We have actually had to pick the Tv up and shake it to get the screws out once they were loosened. This is probably not a problem for most people but we are retired and we bring our TV when we lease condominiums at various places because many do not have Hd TVs in their units.

This is the first LCD TV I've owned and it replaced is a Sony Trinitron HDTV manufactured around 2002.  The Sony had a good picture and really good bright colors.  The reason I wanted to upgrade was because it was dated and I didn't like the overscan when it was hooked up to our Comcast cable box.  It was also 4:3 and and there was always the black bars at the top and bottom when we watched HD content and a square in the middle for 4:3 content because it was contained within the 16:9 frame.Ok, on to the review of this TV.  I bought it at a certain retail chain with a red bullseye as their logo rather than on Amazon.  I did that because I wanted to make sure I got a Samsung LCD panel since I didn't want to lose the \"panel lottery.\"  They had a version TS02 at said store so I was content paying the slightly higher price to get that.  The TV says it was manufactured around 12/2012 and has version 1018 firmware.I started with F. Maria's settings as a baseline and did some of my own tweaking.  We have a dimly lit living room so I had to tone it down a bit.  Being used to the Sony CRT, it's hard to adjust to the LCD motion.  I had to set the auto motion plus to Clear (or off) because anything else makes the picture look like a \"Mexican Soap Opera\" (my wife's words).  Anyway, it probably just me needing to get used to the LCD style of picture.It's been a challenge trying to get the colors to look as natural as the Sony, but maybe's it's unfair comparing it to a Trinitron CRT which is known for excellent color reproduction.  The biggest problem is that the picture takes on a slightly pink hue when viewing on an angle.  The more of an angle, the more pink it is.  Has anyone else had this problem??  I can't seem to tweak it out and I'm not sure if it's a firmware problem or the version of the panel.  The color is decent when watching it straight on from the \"sweet spot\" though.I had high hopes based on the reviews, and I don't want to say I'm disappointed, but it's just not the \"WOW!\" that others have claimed.  It does excellent with HD animation like Disney Pixar movies but normal TV is just good.  I thought I had gotten the best with the Samsung TS0x panel, but I'm not so sure.I searched to see if others had the same pink problem, but I haven't found too many.  Maybe I need to take it back and exchange it?Any comments would be appreciated.  Thanks!UPDATE - 3/12/2013: I've upgraded this to 4 stars because we got a Blu-ray player last night and rented our first blu-ray movie.  Very good picture, it was like we were at the movies, so I'm adding a star for that.  The color is still washed out a bit when viewing on an angle though.

I THOUGHT we had a good TV in that old Samsung, so we focused on newer Samsung models. When we set up this new, larger 1080p Samsung, the first thing we watched was one of our favorites, Burn Notice. I swear the picture was so good it looked like you could reach through the screen and slap Michael Weston's new smarmy boss. The old 720p was good, but this new 1080p is simply amazing.We checked out a lot of other brands in various stores before buying, but none matched the Samsung's picture quality in this size. Not even close. I paid a bit more than I had originally planned for this new replacement, but the picture is definately worth it. Just stunning!!By the way, we also purchased a Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet as recommended by Amazon, even though we already had a cable from the old TV. The new high speed HDMI cable made a big difference in the picture quality. (Yes, I did check out both cables and the display difference was very noticable.)One small down side is the number of HDMI connections. WOULD have prefered 1 or 2 more, but since this is the same number as the old TV, not that big a deal.

Let's be honest.  The marketing term of art, smart tv is just that a marketing gimmick. None of these tv's are particularly smart, they merely can do thing like access the internet, stream tv etc.  You can do this anyway through various interfaces, such as apple tv, your blue ray players etc.  Why pay up?  Perhaps for a slightly higher build quality; however if that is not your concern then this tv is for you.  It has an outstanding image.  I upgraded from a highend Samsung that was 5 years old and their is an enormous improvement.  The main drawback with this model are as mentioned very limited inputs: 2 HDMI which are in a somewhat awkward place on the far right side of the rear panel which means if your stereo and blueray players are on the left you need very long hdmi cables (10'-15'). Also you get only two audio outputs, one optical and one analog plug, there is no coaxial.  Only one component cable input, and no s-video.  The documentation and instructions are very spotty compared to previous Samsung owner manuals, but are sufficient if you are already savy.  You need to assemble the stand which is fairly simple and involves putting in 8 philips head screws.  The tv is very light compared to my older model and as I said may not have the same build quality you come to expect from Samsung. Only time will tell if this is important.  The plus side is that you are paying 1/4 to 1/3 the price of what you have paid so maybe that's less important.

You do have to do some Tweaking with the picture. so I did this and worked:If you choose to set the `Eco Solutions' setting found under the `Plug & Play Tab' to `Off', then try these settings. I recommend that you do a `Picture Reset' first. This is found under the `Picture' settings.Under The `TV Picture' settings, I have the `Picture Mode' set to `Standard', the `Backlight' set to `10', `Contrast' set to `80', Brightness set to `45', `Sharpness' set to `50', color set to `50', and tint (G/R) set to `50/50. Under the `Advance Tab' settings, I set the `Color Space' to `Native', the `Dynamic Contrast' to `Low', the `Black Tone' to 'Dark', (and here is a big change), the `Flesh Tone' to -3, and the `Motion Lighting' to `Off'.

Not so on these new 'thin-boarder' types: the reflected sound has no bass content and make it sound tinny and weak with little substance.My only real complaint was that it came without ANY of the mounting screws! Had to go to local hardware store to get some that just fit ok.  Called Samsung and they took 2 weeks to get them to me!

Overall, this set has 3 preset color choices: 1.) \"Dynamic\" - This setting brings the screen to a bright aspect, although its a bit too bright for some sports and it causes over saturation of colors. 2.) \"Standard\" - This could be considered as \"normal\" viewing; the video settings are set for the run of the mill everyday viewing and are slightly bright, but nowhere near the brightness settings of the \"dynamic\" presetting, nevertheless, it looks good. 3.) \"Movie\" - This mode is used for well, movies. Its a much darker video setting, this is rather useful for watching sports that tend to have many contrasting colors (From uniforms and the color of the field, etc.) I've found that if I choose the \"Dynamic\" presetting and then tweak the brightness settings a bit, it looks pretty good. I've noticed that may reviews found on here for this series (EH6000) show what settings the user has chosen regarding color levels and audio settings for their viewing experience. While that's helpful, I would think that each user has different eye site and hearing levels and thus, I would recommend that each user chooses their own tweaked settings. The EH6000 lines comes in six different sizes. It comes in 40, 46, 50, 55, 60 and 65 inches. Other then the sizes, the specifications on each set are identical. So overall, this review apples to all the sizes mentioned above. As for the stand that came with it, I can't say much about it since I've mounted my set on the wall, but from what I saw when I took it out of the box, it looked pretty strong and it was in a black piano finish. As for the remote control, I found it to be rather small with many buttons squished together. It has a back lit function which is always a plus. Also, batteries are packed with the remote so that's also another plus. I've noticed that this remote control unit is identical to the ones used for some of Samsung's current plasma HDTV's as well. The bottom right of the set has a round push in button that jogs around similar to that of an iPod. When this button is pushed in, a small user interface comes up on the bottom right of the screen where you can pretty much do everything that you can do on the remote control unit itself. One factor I found to be a bit perplexing on the EH6000 series is the fact that it only has two HDMI inputs and one USB input. These are located on the right side of the HDTV.(But this issue can be resolved by getting a HDMI switch and a large capacity USB flash drive or external USB hard drive) On the back, you'll find a digital audio output as well as a composite input and the standard analog antenna cable input. The finish of the set it self is piano black. This is fairly popular in today's HDTV's TVs and computer monitors. It looks nice but if you hardly touch it, a rather large finger print or smudge shows and its somewhat difficult to remove. It would be great if in the future they can make the finishes on HDTV's and computer monitors more finger print friendly. So over all, yes, its a great HDTV with some minor setbacks that can be resolved.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little HDTV!", "Author": "Pastor Jay", "ReviewID": "R38VSYIJLC0M2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The great part: I was able to get this free using my Chase credit card points.

They got there 30 min after that time and when I brought this up, said that I wasn't there the day before in the morning, when I had told them explicitly I wouldn't be there! Very frustrating.

It sucked. While visiting my inlaws a few days later,  I noticed their TV, which was a 3 year old Samsung 46\", roughly equivalent in model to this one. Wow. The picture just popped, motion was smooth, and most importantly my eyes did not become \"fatigued\" when watching it.I looked immediately when I came home into these newer Samsungs. I did not want or care about \"smart\" tv, either a Roku or decent BlyRay will do all of that. I wanted first and foremost the best PICTURE quality. And this set has that.I agree that lack of inputs (and outputs - NO audio out, just FYI) may be an issue for some. For anyone for whom 2 HDMI and one Composite/S is enough though, this really stands out. The picture is amazing, tweakable, and the motion is just smooth as can be. I cant say enough, VERY happy.

I have been unable to disable this feature on my TV. When I am watching my TV, if the scene in the show or movie is dark, the back-light of this TV turns completely off. Samsung refers to this issue as the \"Eco Sensor.\" According to all of their promotional materials, it dims the TV based upon the brightness of the in-room lighting. This is NOT true. It dims based upon the brightness of the image on the screen. It has absolutely nothing to do with the in-room lighting. I contacted Samsung customer support. They told me to go to the menu, and specify \"Off\" for the Eco Sensor and the Energy Saving. I did. It had no effect. They told me to install the new firmware update. I did. It had no effect. They asked me to remove all input devices. I did. It had no effect. It happens even when just watching normal TV channels. I really don't understand the purpose of removing the back-light from scenes that are already dark and difficult to see. If I am watching a movie or a show that frequently goes from dim scenes to bright scenes, the back-light also turns on and off frequently, to the point where the picture appears to be flickering. This is unacceptable. The Samsung support has been very arrogant, unprofessional, and unhelpful when I have contacted them about this issue. I have been e-mailing, instant messaging, and calling Samsung over the past 4 months, and they have not accomplished anything in terms of assisting me with this problem. I find it a bit audacious to refer to such a feature as \"Eco Sensor.\" Does Samsung really think that repeatedly shutting of the back-light of my TV is helping the environment? Hey Samsung, maybe I should just turn off my TV altogether every day? I bet that would really help the environment by that logic.The second major deal-breaker with this TV is that the audio sporadically does not work at all for some channels. It is completely random when this happens, but it always seems to affect channels in the range of ch. 40-59. Sometimes, there is literally no sound at all for certain channels. Other times, it is just the commercials that have no sound. Other times, some commercials have sound but others do not. I thought maybe it was just an issue with the cable company, so I went to the other TV's in my house and watched the same channels at the same time, and the audio was working just fine on every other TV. They have the same cable connection. I went back to my room to find that this Samsung TV still had no audio. This issue happens randomly, so I think this will be difficult to prove it is happening to a technical support person.I called up Samsung again today. A customer support person said that she would have the next level of customer support call me within 2 days. This is the same company that does not answer their e-mails at all for months on end when I have e-mailed them about these issues. She said that if the next person that calls me deems it appropriate, they may send a technical support person to my house to try to fix it. After that, if that person is unable to fix it, then and only them can we begin talking about replacing this defective unit. I really hope that I won't have to take off several days of work for this nonsense. I just want this lemon replaced. All of their customer support people that I have talked to seemed very rude and not knowledgeable.Overall, I will never buy anything from Samsung ever again. I was heavily considering buying a Samsung smartphone, but now I have no interest in doing so. This TV is defective, and their customer support people have been useless. I fully expect a long slog of a battle before I can finally get this defective unit replaced... that's IF I am able to get it replaced. I did I lot of prior research, and I thought that I was making a great decision when I bought this TV, but now I can see that I was wrong. This TV is disappointing and I regret buying it. It has been a nightmare of an experience dealing with their completely useless customer support. If you are considering buying this TV, I would highly recommend that you weigh your options before doing so.That being said, I feel like I am pretty much stuck with this lemon. I have no confidence in Samsung to do the right thing and replace this TV. So, if anyone has any advice as to how to resolve the issues that I have outlined in this review, please feel free to offer it. I will post updates as to whether or not I am able to get any of this resolved.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung 49 un40eh6000", "Author": "Bill Bowman", "ReviewID": "R1JVB8Y2OM970R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is the best that I have owned ...

Actually, I bought two of them at once, one for me, another for my mom.  The standard and movie mode colors are so muted one would think there is something wrong with the set.  On the other hand, the dynamic is so bright, there is no detail or contrast to picture.  On all my other Samsungs, it was plug and play and I got a great picture.  I have been tweaking this one for days and still can't get it to look good.  Avoid this set- there are better ones out there.  And if you think I'm lying, look at some of the more extensive reviews for this set on Amazon.  They all go into great pains to explain how they tweaked and customized the set to look good.  believe me, I have now been tweaking for weeks now and still can't get it to look as good as my older Samsungs.  I think the problem lies in the fact this is the first Samsung LED I bought.  At the end of the day- I am not happy.  If you never bought a hi def TV before and you are replacing an old CRT set, I guess this Samsung will look OK.  However, if you've purchased hi def LCDs before- avoid this model range.

In less than 2 weeks of use one of the TV's developed a horizontal line across the screen about 40% up from the bottom as if a row of pixels wasn't working.  I contacted Samsung online support via chat and Iris asked me to try a couple of things to fix the problem but nothing worked.  She advised that the TV would have to be taken in for service.  I asked to have the TV replaced and I would send mine in for service so I wouldn't be without a TV (I gave my old set away) and that wasn't an option.  She sent me a link for the service request.The service request was fairly straightforward but the problems came when I had to upload my purchase receipt.  It would not accept .docx files and the file name (including path) had to be less than 20 characters.  After 10 minutes of trying to get the file uploaded I finally got it to work.  For a technology company you'd think their system would be able to accomodate the newest file types and allow more than 20 characters.  Surprising.I bought a 55\" Samsung LED TV a year ago and have been more than pleased with it which is why I decided to purchase another Samsung this year to replace an old tube TV.  I'm very disappointed with the issue that developed in less than 2 weeks worth of use and their refusal to replace it so I wouldn't be without a TV while it's being repaired.  I'll update my review after dealing with the service of my TV but as of right now I couldn't be more disappointed with Samsung and the UN40EH6000.UPDATE - Samsung sent a Tech to my house and they had to replace the panel (screen).  I was worried that I would not be satisfied with the repair but I couldn't have been more wrong.  The panel was replaced and they were gone within 30 minutes.  The TV looks and works great so I've changed my rating to 5 stars.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perhaps too fragile for delivery", "Author": "ksting", "ReviewID": "R2WM805W7W9XO7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I feel I must warn other potential buyers that an LCD TV is only as good as your parcel service. I ordered this TV, attached the base, plugged it in and was horrified to find an ugly black cracked screen instead of a nice picture. Thankfully, Amazon has an impeccable exchange and return policy so I sent it back for a replacement. Lo and behold, the second TV arrived, also with a cracked screen. There was damage to the front of the box in both cases so I can only assume UPS is responsible. I wish they could find another way to ship these TVs. I've since given up and have asked for a refund. We went to an old-fashioned box store and carefully strapped our new TV (es5050, not the eh6000; we figured we'd try to save some money since we weren't purchasing from Amazon) into our car.

The EH series is a replacement for the LCD units.If your requirements include: internet vs none, 4 HDMI ports vs 2, 15w speakers vs 10w, 2 Components ports instead of 1, Very Slim design because it will not be in a cabinet and an upgraded picture quality - then the EH series will be the wrong choice.All Samsung TV's offer incredible picture quality and as you go up in class (which you will if the requirements are as stated) the picture becomes even better; which is a bonus when you add all the above D class features.My EH Series TV was sent back to Amazon for a Full refund due to the original link suggesting this was a replacement for D.The D series will cost more money and they are much more difficult to find. Sears offers a un40d6000, and some other on line retailers.Originally I typed in Search: UN40D6000SF which was taken from Samsungs website and Amazon listed the tv and had a link to select the newer 6000 model which is listed as UN40eh6000 - I proceeded to order the newer version without reviewing the specs and as it turns out, this is a promotional grade product. After opening the box and assembling the base to the TV is when I realized that the New version is 2.5\" thicker, not the 1.2 inch thickness advertised on Samsungs website, only 2 HDMI ports instead of 4; and lacking other Specs listed on Samsungs site.The TV feels cheap compared to my 60\" samsung 6800 series 1.5 inch.Samsung TV's picture quality is excellent, but be careful with the model numbers. EH is a promotional grade product with lower specs. I've sent the TV back to Amazon and now I must find the \"D\" version.
