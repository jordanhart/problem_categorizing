We got it to replace a three year old, 32-inch Sony that has served us very well in our bedroom, but we wanted a bigger screen.  We got the bigger screen in a better looking cabinet, and, a much better picture, much better sound, and a much better tuner.UPDATE (8/24/08) - If I could give this TV more than 5 stars, I would.  When I registered my TV with SAMSUNG online (as opposed to mailing in the warranty card), they automatically extended the warranty from 12 to 18 months.  Then, 2 days ago, I got a box in the mail from SAMSUNG with their USB wireless network adapter.  For free!  I attached it and gave myself a crash course in setting up wireless network security. At first I used automatic network setup on the TV menu.  It worked well but intermittently with WPA-PSK encryption, but, flawlessly when I used manual wireless setup. The content this gives you is from USA Today.  I found out what \"That Darn Wheel\" on the remote is really for.  When you read a multipage news story, you have to use the wheel to turn the pages.  There's no other way.I ordered a cheap HDMI cable from an Amazon independent vendor (cost $6, including shipping) and hooked the TV up to a Philips 160 GB HDD/DVD recorder with a built-in digital QAM tuner.  Got rid of all the other cables to neaten up the cable tangle situation.  The recorder does 1080P upscaling if you use the HDMI interface and the TV automatically senses and adjusts its resolution mode to match. Makes even regular channels look almost as good as the HIDEF ones.  I don't use the recorder's tuner all the time for normal TV viewing, but when I need it, its there to add a new dimension for enjoying this TV's many features.I got almost $150 back during the 30 day grace period, and the price has fallen another $159 since, but I got it when when I needed it and don't regret not getting a better price. Every time I turn it on, I am glad I chose this model.Back to my original review -PLUSES -CABINET - The jet black bezel has a subtle tinge of red, and is accented with a clear rim.  It's stunning.SOUND- I chose this model for the internal subwoofer.  We don't want multiple speakers in our bedroom, and the Samsung's internal speakers work fine.  We loaded a Blueman Group DVD and the internal woofer was pretty powerful.  I turned up the bass on the built-in equalizer and had to throttle it back to neutral so the room wouldn't shake.  The factory settings are fine.PICTURE - The picture is sharp, even on analog channels.  Digital channels look even better.  The wideband flourescent backlight delivers the promised color performance.  The factory settings make both analog and digital pictures look fantastic, but I detuned the picture to dim down the light emitted into the room and set the energy saving feature to high which also degrades the picture.  Know what?  It still looks great.TUNER - We don't have and don't want to use the cable company's box,  but, we can get all the analog content and unscrambled digital, high def channels they offer (NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, and PBS).  The Sony's tuner used to break up on Fox and ABC high def channels, but the Samsung's tuner locks in tight on everything. The Sony took a few seconds to lock on digital channels and the Samsung does this much faster.MINUSES - Not many.PRELOADED CONTENT - The content the factory loaded on the internal flash drive seems silly.  It includes games, artwork, recipes, and entertaiment.  The artwork includes high def works by Monet, Van Gogh, and Latrec.  I can see that it might be nice to use the TV as a picture frame, but who needs it.  The other content is OK to look at once, but after that, never again.  You can't add content to the internal memory, but you can use MP3 and JPEG content on an external USB thumb drive.THAT DARN WHEEL - Overall, the remote is also great, but the wheel is twitchy and there isn't a single thing you can do with it that you can't do easier by just using it as a 4-way switch (up, down, left, right).  It's more awkward to twist the wheel with your thumb than it is to push down on the wheel's edge, but if you aren't careful the slightest twist will change the function you are trying to adjust.  It's not hard to master the feel, but the wheel is a totally unnecessary feature.  Wonder how much it adds to the remote's production cost.  The remote lights up when you touch it, which is great while you are learning where all the buttons are, but it does run the batteries down faster, so the instructions say.  You can easily enable and disable the light function.Amazon's price was right and it dropped $45 between the time I ordered and when it was delivered.  Getting a refund for the difference took less than 5 minutes on the phone.  The TV was delivered 5 days earlier than promised.Directions on how to adjust the TV on/off melody sound, which is annoying, are on page 61 of the manual. Navigate to menu/setup/external settings/melody. then select \"off.\"", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Form and Function", "Author": "benjamin bannister \"Creative Connoisseur\"", "ReviewID": "R19A54SHGL00FJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about a month now, all I can say is I have no regrets about this purchase. Of course after heavy researching it came down to this TV based on what I was particularly looking for - form and function. I realized there are new Samsung TVs coming out, but I didn't want to wait for them to be released and then wait yet again for it to become affordable so this was the best option for me. Having a previous Samsung SlimFit TV did sway me to stick with the brand as that TV was beautiful (but TOO heavy).The pluses and minuses:- BEAUTIFULThe red finish that borders around the TV is sleek and subtle (and matches the red accents in my living room, PLUS!). Please note that the red on the 650 version is only on the top and bottom, which looked a little odd for me. The 650 also has that (what I considered super ugly) oval shaped stand compared to the rectangle here.- USB INPUT and DLNAI can watch movies I save onto a USB drive that I plug into the TV. And with DLNA, I can just attach a LAN cable to access most of my media files on my computer *from* the TV! Brilliant! Worth the extra money, by not having to pause it from my computer in another room. (Note on this, you can't rewind and fast-forward computer files after it gets past a certain file size. That means if you are watching a movie and accidentally press stop instead of pause, it's best to watch the rest on a computer. Samsung needs to work on this for future TVs).- 1GB BUILT-IN \"ENTERTAINMENT\" CONTENTThis feature is essentially pointless--especially the games. I wish I could format the space and do other things with it, but it doesn't hurt the purchase. I'll just access it when I want to learn how to make a salmon sandwich.- VIDEO QUALITYAfter calibration, HD inputs from a digital antenna and Blu-Ray look stunning. Digital air signals come through flawlessly with the same antenna I've been using for a couple of years. As for the viewing angle, I wouldn't say it's 178 degrees though. As long as you're not sitting on the floor to the side or something, you should be fine. The 50,000:1 Dynamic contrast as you know is not the real contrast ratio. That's like the \"digital zoom\" feature on a camera, totally a sham. However the contrast is just fine with that feature off. Blacks are deep, whites are light. Beautiful.- LIGHTWEIGHTI have the 40\" version which I can lift myself! (It also fits my TV stand perfectly. I would've opted for the 46\", but that would require buying bigger everythings, and because of living in New York, you have to make most efficient use of space).- THINNESSIt's thin. Which is good and bad. Thin looks great, but now I can't put my center speaker of my surround sound system on top of the TV because it's just too thin and not a flat surface to sit on top. I've had to put it in front of the TV, which is fine. Again, this is not a flaw of the TV itself, I just have to adapt.- 120hz AUTO MOTION RUBBISH2 words, total rubbish, or utterly pointless. Sure the example they give you says it can \"intelligently calculate a middle image\" between 2 images (using a ball from point A to point B as a simple example), but I don't know how *any* TV could *ever* predict motion between 2 complicated set of frames. It looks stupid, it looks unnatural for movies, and I have no idea why this is even on here or a selling point for this TV. If anything, this made me *not* want to get the TV, but thankfully, you can turn this \"feature\" off. Hurray! Likewise DNIe and the \"video enhancement modes\" are rubbish for regular people that don't know how to adjust picture quality. Sorry regular people. I turned all these to \"off\".- BACKLIGHTThe other \"complaint\" is the function of backlight. I like that in the menu you can adjust backlight levels manually, but then, they give you an energy saving option that sort of counter-acts that. It makes you wonder if lowering the backlight and turning off power-saving is the same as turning up the backlight and setting power-saving to maximum. Who knows.- SOUNDIt's fine. The built in woofer is a plus. The speakers are loud, I never have it above 20 (out of 100). Not so sure on the TruSurround XT, still seems gimmicky to me, but it doesn't hurt it. Depending on the content, it does sound better with it on. I usually don't care about TV speakers since I have a surround sound system I use instead.- THE REMOTEIt looks cool. I'm a bit iffy on the scroll wheel. it doesn't really work well if you swirl it around, it's best you just press in the direction you want. The back-lit buttons are a major plus!I believe I have addressed most issues and most of the things I had concerns with before I bought it. All in all, I'm not complaining, I like the TV a lot! I don't want to say I love it because it's a material object. I'm glad that Samsung gives you the option of turning most of their features off, and being able to customize a lot. The thing that would make it super perfect would be to add an LED backlight, but that would cost an extra $1000+ or so. Oh, and if you live in New York, buy it somewhere else online where they don't charge you that extra 8% for tax. :-)Hope this helps.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV - works ok for Linux/home networking, HDHomeRun", "Author": "W. Gadsby", "ReviewID": "R1G3LLG2LGGGZ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first high definition set.  I chose this TV for the DLNA compatiblity.  If you're not looking for networking, the 650 is probably a better choice.  The extra subwoofer is of no value to me, anyway.  I have the set connected to a high quality A/V receiver with speakers, and the sound quality is much better than with the TV alone with its built-in subwoofer.  There is no comparison.  If you're not using it through a conventional audio system, it might help some, but don't count on getting high quality audio without larger speakers.  The extra $200 or so for this set over the 650 is primarily justified by its networking capability.Picture quality is incredible.  The upconversion engine seems to do an excellent job at converting low definition video.  I've watched standard DVDs via component video and SD TiVo programming via the S-Video input, and both look great.  I've seen older HDTV sets that have washed out video when showing SD material, and this one definitely does not have that problem.The tuner sensitivity is very good.  The analog tuner pulls in stations better than anything else I've seen.  The digital sensitivity ends up being not quite as good as my HTL-HD HDTV converter box, however, which has about the best sensitivity I've seen for a digital tuner.  One or two digital stations the HTL-HD receives cannot be received by the TV in a similar setup.I already have an extensive home media system and wanted to be able to stream media from Linux PCs to the television set.  There are many pitfalls in getting this set up, but with a properly operating DLNA server and a compatible video source, it is possible to stream high definition (1920x1080) video.  My present setup includes a HDHomeRun networked HDTV tuner, which sends data to a Pentium III 800 MHz PC with Linux, which saves the data to disk, and then serves it using the Fuppes DLNA server program.  There are no dropouts, and everything seems to work fine.  One big drawback, however - you can't fast forward or rewind networked material.The TV has no problem with JPEG and MP3 files once set up properly.  I had an issue with Fuppes on JPEG files, but the problem was with the program, not the TV.  MP3 files must be sampled at 44.1 kHz or perhaps 48 kHz to work properly.  I had some files from cassettes that were recorded at a 32 kHz sample rate, and the TV would not play them directly.  Fortunately, Fuppes can transcode the files on the fly.All in all, an excellent value if you need a TV with networking capability.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time tinkering with software and settings to get the networking operating correctly.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Such a Deal!!!", "Author": "intrigued2", "ReviewID": "RWEOEHQVKBCD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung LN40A750 40-Inch 1080p DLNA LCD HDTV with RED Touch of ColorI bought this HDTV for my husband on Father's Day.

Amazon guarantees that if the price drops within 30 days of a product shipping, they will refund you the difference.

The picture quality using a Belkin HDMI to my DVR viewing HD movies is so good friends ask if its Blu-Ray.  The 120HZ refresh rate along with the contrast ratio make everything from normal TV to HD tv sickening beautiful.  So after getting over the amazing picture quality, saying the amount of inputs is great is an understatement.  There are 4 HDMI's which are great, but the two goldmines are the usb and network ports.  The network port allows weather info and basic stuff provided by Samsung's link, but it also connects to your home network so you can play movies, mp3s, and pictures.  I have lots of ipod videos on my pc that I can play on the tv this way - kind of neat feature to have.  The usb port allows for software updates, playing media, etc.  I also liked how the HDMI automatically determines what kind of signal is coming in, and how the audio out is always on so turning the volume down on the tv does not affect stereo input.  I've been a huge Sony fan and still am, but the price/performance of the Samsungs' 120HZ line is much better and the additional features make it a no brainer.", "Date": "July 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent product-price-delivery", "Author": "Dennis Kleier \"DK-FLA\"", "ReviewID": "RDIC713OXCPAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was always reluctant to order something like a TV online but the price for this Samsung 40\" A750 without sales tax and free delivery was too hard to pass up.

It is the most impressive picture I have seen outside a theatre.  My wife was so impressed she made me order an HD for the bedroom.  The sound is excellent and when coupled with my stereo speakers is great.  The one annoying factor is the sound it makes when powering up and down.  I am sure there is a switch to shut it off but I am too busy to read the manual to find the adjustment,  since I am watching the most wonderful video on the HD channels and movies.

The Touch of Red looks very good on the A750 and gives it an extremely modern and stylish appearance that I preferred to the softer, rounded A650 bezel style.

I bought this particular brand and model for many reasons but mainly for the wiselink.  Wiselink is a USB port on the TV that allows you to watch video, view pictures, and listen to MP3's via a thumbdrive.  I have a lot of digital video and audio so I just load up a 16 gb thumbdrive and leave it hooked up to the tv - this eliminates me from having to burn DVD's saving lots of money.  Just remember to add .avi or .mp3 at the end of your videos and music so the tv will recognize the file.I have basic cable but the LCD recognizes some digital channels being broadcast and they look great.  The regular TV broadcast isn't as good but you get used to it pretty quick.  I also have a Sony bd550 and XBOX 360.  They both look amazing.  Another thing about the XBOX is you can stream Netflix movies through it - some in HD and some Standard - both look great.The only bad experience I have had with purchasing this LCD has nothing to do with the TV itself.  The delivery company SUCKS!!!.  My TV was sent on DEC 9th and I didn't receive it til almost 3 weeks later.  Doesn't sound terrible until I tell you it was sent from a location that you can drive to in about 2 hours.I contacted amazon (through email and by phone) because I couldn't find any information for CEVA anywhere and they gave me CEVA's customer service number.  When I called CEVA they told me my package had been sitting in their wharehouse for over 2 weeks and he didn't know why I wasn't contacted - no notes were entered under my tracking number.  I scheduled a delivery for the next day with a 4 hour window.  Around the 5th hour I called CEVA again and was told they would call me back at their convienence.  When I received the call the CSR was rude and basically just explained that they were busy because of the holiday season.  I told them I understood but a courtesy call would have been the appropriate thing to do.When the driver finally showed up his helper was his 9year old son who couldn't help but slam the box up and down the walls carrying it upstairs to my living room.  They took the TV out of the box, set it on the floor, plug it in, and told me turn it with the remote.  He did ask me to check it for damage before I signed for it.

I've had the TV 4 mos. and here are some of the things I wish were different.- the TV is way too smart.  I had a old flat-screen tube TV and I easily plugged an ipod dock up to work through my TV with my Bose Cinemate.  With this TV, I can't plug my ipod dock into it and play it through the TV because it can't find a video signal when I want to play music. It just flashes, \"No signal detected\".  I couldn't believe that I pay $1,500 for a TV and I can't plug an ipod dock into it! (I can't plug the dock into my BOSE, because it doesn't have enough inputs)- The sensor for the remote is NOT in the MIDDLE of the TV!!! What a PAIN! In order to work the remote you have to angle the remote to that corner of the TV.  If you plan to use your TV in an armoire piece of furniture, know that the \"walls\" and doors will get in the way of you turning the TV on/off.- Perhaps the MOST annoying function, is the touch buttons.  They are not very sensitive to the touch AND they are SO HARD TO SEE! You can't see what button you're pushing (I'm 30yrs old - not a 50yr old!).  So you have to just keep jabbing at the screen.  To turn off the TV (on the TV), it takes 10 seconds instead of a split second.

I also like the fact the the picture size adjust itself as they shown on the screen. A lot of TVs don't do that..and as result, you get bad blurry video in certain segment of video...be it commercials or whatever...you name it!! The sound ain't bad either...it's above decent. You can always hook up to a sound system.I don't know why some complaint about the red touch around the screen as being distracted....it looks absolutely beautiful.

I like the red touch because it makes the TV look unique.This TV also allowed you to play files off of the PC.

Specifically they have issues with the capacitors on the power supply board. It turns out that Samsung has a free capacitor repair program, but it only applies to certain models and your TV manufacture date has to less than 39 months old (not the date your purchased it, the actual manufacture date).This TV costs around $1,600 to $2,000.  Believe me, you will be buying an expensive TV that lasts only 2.5 to 3.5 years. Once the power supply issue begins, you will have a $2,000 paper weight. It won't be good for anything else. Search for \"Samsung capacitor issues\" or \"Samsung power supply issues\" online and you'll find plenty to read. I always thought Samsung was a good company, but after dealing with this issue, I am surprised how unresponsive Samsung has been. They refuse to recall these TV's.

Perhaps down the road we'll add a speaker system , but in our not-so-big living room the TV sound seems plenty good enough.We've got lots of windows and sunlight, but the screen of this Samsung is fine even in full daylight.

The media server needs a litte work.  Support for x264 media files would be great.  Currently it plays xvid and avi, std mpeg files fine.  The DNLA, not being any kind of standard as of yet is a bit premature, compatibility with earlier file sharing protocols would have been helpful.  I have a Synology Media server which does not currently support DNLA, although the samsung is able to read the contents of the server and even list the programs, selecting a program from the list crashes the tv and causes a reboot.

The base swiveled, it had a light in front of the monitor, the unbelievable 500,000:1 dynamic contrast, and of course the LEDs that turn off to bring out the deep blacks.  Everything was perfect for the TV EXCEPT for the \"Anti-Judder\" function of LED motion plus.  It wasn't nowhere as good as the 120Hz the A750 has.  The A750 delivers beautiful deep blacks just like the 81F series did and both have beautiful color displays.  The A750 in my opinion is a notch better because of the 120Hz this TV delivers.  I could not take the judder of fast moving objects on the 81F.  I wanted crystal clear HD quality all around and the A750 has that.  I couldn't ask for anything more.Update 1-7-13:My LCD just went on me a little after 4 years.  It is now cycling on and off with no option to view the menu.  About an hour into researching online I found that this LCD model number falls under a class action lawsuit against Samsung.  The capacitors used when the LCD was manufactured were the wrongs ones used.  I'll post the link from the samsung website.  I got a phone number from the link and called where a rep who was very friendly handled my call.  Before you call you will need the model number and 3 sticker label numbers which are the model code, serial number and version number found on the right side of the unit of the LCD.  After she got the info from me she then gave me a reference number and gave me the contact info to a local repair service.  I dropped my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars.  If everything goes well I'll raise my rating to 4 stars.  I'll give another update on how things turned out after the repair.[...]Update 3-01-13So I received a call from the repair shop and due to the faulty capacitors my panel also blew out.  The cost for repair was $675 plus tax.  I called Samsung again and got the same lame excuse that I'm out of warranty which is obvious.  Due to their cutting corner ways to maximize profit I was sold a lemon.  $1700 down the drain.  It's official that the TV is done and not worth repairing.  Samsung lost another customer for life and I will never spend a fortune on another set again.  I just purchased a 48\" TCL HDTV set for $469.

This is truly ludicrous.  Not sure why the smart folks at Samsung can't get this done since EVERYONE needs to swivel their TV from time to time.....2) I never could figure out what the \"touch of red\" was all about, until the TV arrived.  On the 750, its a tacky 4 inch black plastic frame around the screen, with about a 1/4 inch clear outer rim of clear plastic.  The transition from the black to the clear plastic is a thin layer of red.  Big f*#king deal.  My previous TV was a 40 inch Sony LCD, which frankly looked a bit more dignified.

However I heard so many good things about the Samsung products, I decided to check them out.  I wanted to get a flat panel TV for my bedroom in the 40\" to 42\" range.  As I only watch TV and not DVD's in the bedroom, I felt an LCD would be the best choice and bang for the buck.  I was originally going to buy a 6 Series Samsung but read some reviews that the seven series had a better bass response and superior audio than the 6 Series.  I checked the specs on both models and the video was pretty much identical and Amazon's price was so good I choise the 7 Series Model LN40A750.  Now I have a top of the line Sony 60\" HDTV in my living room that I thought had a phnominal picture.  That was until I received this Samsung.  The picture is so crystal clear with deep black leves that it completely blows away the Sony.  The Amazon Delivery guys had it unpacked, setup and programed in less than twenty minutes.  They gave me a brief run down on how the remote works and how to navigate the menues.  The whole experience from ordering it online, receiving it five days later and having to set it up for me was so painless, I was waiting for something to go wrong.  Well I have had the TV for about three weeks now and I love this Samsung TV so much that I am spending more time watching that one than my 60\" Sony. Once my wife saw the picture, she said she would never see me in the living room again and while that is not totally true, I am enjoying this TV far more than I thought possible.  It has only been three weeks, but so far I can find nothing that I don't like about this TV.  Time will tell whether it is as reliable as my past Sony TV's have been, but as of now, I would highly recommend this TV for anyone shopping for a 40\" LCD TV.  The Menu is easily navigated and I just can't say enough about the great picture.  The sound is great for my bedroom, and would probably be just fine in most living room as well.  As with any HDTV though, having it hooked up to a real surround Sound system would greatly enhance the experience.  But for stock TV sound it is pretty darn good and has a grapic equillizer adjustment to tune the sound to your particular environment.  About the only thing that I just don't get is the Red Touch of Color strip around the outside edge of the TV.  It really only shows up in bright daylight.  Now if it lit up in red, or other colors, that might be cool, but in the bedroom at night it really does not show up.  Since that is strictly a cosmetic touch and does not affect the viewing of the TV I would not call it a negative.  So far, I can not think of anything i do not like on this TV.  I did compare the picture quality to the 5 series Samsung and I can say the difference is night and day.  If you watch a lot of TV, then don't scimp for the cheaper model.  The 6, 7 and 9 Series are so far superior in picture and sound to Samsungs lower models that it was an easy choice for me to spend a bit more.  A TV is something you tend to live with for a long time.  If you spend a significant amount of time watching TV and movies, then it becomes very easy to justify the few hunred dollars more for the better series TV.  Go to your local electronics store and compare them side by side, and you will easily see how dramtic the difference in picture quality really is.

I have seen no problems what-so-ever with black or dark surfaces which on some LCDs suffer from artificats. Motion is good although, the 120Hz feature is a sales thingy - you will still see motion blur but when directly comparing a scene in a movie where there is a problem, with and without the feature turned on, you will clearly notice a difference. So it does help, to some degree.- USB connection. This is very cool. Plugin a USB dongle or harddrive or iPod, and you can play music or watch photos from the USB device, or - this is what I like the most - it allows you to upgrade the firmware of the TV.- Stylish and well organised on-screen menus.- Adequate connections - 4 HDMI ports which at present time seems reasonable COULD in the future turn out to be too little though.- Better than average sound. Compared to the LN40A650 model which I also own, the sound is noticably better which is because of the built-in subwoofer.- Stylish design. Compared to the 600 series, this looks better mainly because of the glass frame but also the foot is fairly nice (especially compared to the oval, sluggish foot on the 600 series).- The 1GB built-in flash with content. I dare listing it here although it also serves as a Con. Because the potential is unique, and I choose to believe that Samsungs intentions are that a utility will one day be available for creating your own contents. See more notes about this under Cons.Cons:- The 1GB built-in flash with content. Before ordering the TV I thought this was a storage space where you could keep your own contents transferred from the USB. But I was dissapointed. It turns out, it is pre-loaded with slideshows/music, cooking recipes, games, fitness programs and what not. Now the idea is good! But it seems foolish you cannot create your own content instead. Alright, I actually WAS looking for a recipe for Salad Nicoise, but hey! Samsung needs to create a utility for the PC where you can create your own content and upload it via the USB.- The remote control. Although not as ugly as other Samsung remotes, this is still not good enough. The wheel I haven't had any problems with like so many others complain about though. Thankfully, for those using cable/sat receiver or universal remotes, this isn't really a problem once you have gone past the initial setup phase and you've made all the adjustments you want. One poor thing though is that the remote does not offer the \"Picture Size\" (\"P.Size\") button which the 600 series does. And apparently there isn't any programmable code for this function either (I have not been able to find the command when programming a Logitech Universal remote for the TV).4.5 Stars would have been the verdict if possible.", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "40\" Samsung Touch of Color", "Author": "P.

The 1500 shipped out later that same evening, while the TV itself shipped out on Monday. I was a little hesitant about CEVA shipping it, as I haven't heard of them prior to purchasing this TV.  The reviews I have read on here have been mixed, and I was a little dismayed to see that Amazon's estimated arrival date wasn't until 11/26/08.  I kept tracking the package online and saw it was actually in my area on Wednesday.  A quick call to CEVA and they set up delivery the next day at 9:00 am.  Got an immediate confirmation email, and a call at 8:30 this morning verifying delivery.  They showed up right on time (a little early even), brought the TV to my room, unpacked it and placed it on my TV stand.  They had offered to hook up all of the connections for me but I declined, part of the fun of getting a new HDTV is setting it up yourself ;-)  They made sure the sound worked great, no dead pixels or lines before they had me sign.  A+++ with CEVA, could not have asked for anything better.Now onto the TV itself.  The TOC is nice, though not too noticeable to me.  The sound is great, granted I have a small room and don't have it cranked up, but I'm still very pleased.  Hooked it up to my Samsung Blu-ray, Popped in \"The Mist Blu-ray\" and was immediately blown away.  A quick search on Google gave me some suggestions on specific color settings and I was able to sit back and be amazed for the next two hours.  Some scenes looked as if I was really there, it's that amazing!Since I have a Blu-ray dvd player that is also a Samsung, I can controll both items with just one remote.  If I pop in a dvd, it will automatically turn the tv on, which is nice.  The downside is, is that if I am watching a dvd and puse it to switch over to something else, then it will stop my dvd and I'll have to find where I left off manually, which can be a little annoying. One broght side of this set-up, is taht when I pop in a dvd to watch while I fall asleep, the sleep timer will turn my tv AND dvd player off, which is great.Still trying to figure out how to set up the RSS feeds with my wireless adapter plugged into the usb port, but I'll look again after work.As many have said, the preloaded features are cool the first few moments, but I seriously doubt I'll look at them ever again.  The wheel on the remote can be a little tricky, but overall not too bad.  If you get too frustrated, you can still click in the direction you want, instead of using the wheel to scroll.I'll be updating this review every so often to keep everyone informed on how the set holds up after time, as well as any issues or whatnot that hopefully will not occur.***Update 01/20/2009*** I suffered the dreaded \"Loop of Death\" last week (that's when the tv will suddenly turn on and off repeatedly and cannot be broken out of thst cycle).

If I keep it I am going to need to buy a Home Theater system so that I can turn off TV speakers.Reported the issue to Samsung. Technician came to my place after two days and suggested to use HDMI instead of Component AV cable. He also said this is common, known issue and has seen many times but may not happen in every house even with the same TV model.I have been using Sony 17\" LCD TV/Monitor until I bought this Samsung two weeks back and I dont hear the humming noise with the auto volume on, except once while technician is trying to test Samsung with a DVD player and working on connections, all of a sudden it(Sony) started humming otherwise Sony is good. Both Sony and Samsung TVs have two 10W Speakers and a Subwoofer. I showed him the difference between two but he could not tell why Samsung makes noise when Sony does not.Currently there are 27 reviews about this product and none of them mentioned this issue.

Amazon.com uses CEVA, and we tracked our purchase.

My expectations were way more than met. The picture quality is fantastic, I couldn't imagine it being better. Even standard definitoin tv looks great. Video games and Blue-Ray look amazing with the 120hz auto-motion feature turned on. Regular tv shows can look a little choppy, almost like the picture skips, when the auto-motion is turned on though, so you have to turn it off for some programming. Turning it off is a two second thing.  Auto-motion also has 4 settings, off/low/medium/high, which I didnt know when I bought it, and it works great. Cartoons and animated movies look absolutely incredidible for the kids, even when not in HD. The extra gadgets that come with the 7 series model and the fact that the red touch of color goes all the way around the set make it well worth the extra money. The physical appearance of the tv looks so much better than I expected, looks great in the living room. I paired it up with a Onkyo surround sound system and its better than going to the movies.

I chose not to buy additional speakers/surround system(attempts at creating surround sound is better than average for this unit), the internal base speaker does a good job in a compact design(can't go above half way without offending neighbors), and saved by not purchasing a home theater so I got an extended warranty(insert tumbs up here).The Bad-is how easily the gloss surface finish gets scratched when wipping off dust(water ONLY!!), and lame LAME Ipod wheel on remote.The UGLY-the base mount does NOT swivel on a TV THIS expensive!?!? If you need to swivel unit often get used to ugly scratches from sliding the TV base on your furniture.Overall I would buy this again FOR SURE if in the future small changes are made to following models. Also a small niggle is the delay to hear a chime when the unit powers up or down - it makes you double take every time while you wait for the acknowledgment chime, irritates yes but not a big deal unless you keep waiting then once the TV doesn't turn on you have to pick up the remote again to turn it on while waiting to hear the chime all over AGAIN.", "Date": "February 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little TV!", "Author": "PD", "ReviewID": "R51Q961P5L9WM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this TV about 3 weeks ago - I am very impressed.

I don't have much more to say then what's already been said here, but I'll do my best.I was trying to decide between this model and the series 6, and ended up with this one because of the built-in subwoofer. I'm glad I did because the sound is definitely excellent! It's not quite surround sound, but the simulated surround sound is still impressive.One of the grea things about this TV is that it works so well right out of the box! I went to a friend's place and he has a 52\" Bravia, but the picture was only 1/2 or 1/3 of the screen most of the time whereas the picture fills my screen like 95% of the time. I went home and watched the same show I was watching at his place at my place and the quality was significantly better on my TV (and we live in the same building, so it's the same cable). On his TV there were lines and it looked like a CRT, whereas mine was a lot cleaner and, while it wasn't very clear because the broadcast itself sucked, it was smoother and looked better overall. I tried messing with some settings but couldn't get it looking as good as my 40\" did. (note: I have my picture mode set to 'dynamic', and it truly does dynamically seem to adapt to video games or TV or whatever I'm watching)This TV is so great that it makes DVDs look better and standard definition video looks great! Sometimes I have to get really close to the TV to convince myself that it really isn't HD. Of course, when you put on something that's true HD (like 1080i or 1080p), it puts everything else to shame. In other words, you can tell the difference between standard def and high def, and yet the former is still better than you may expect. I feel like the main difference from far away between the two is how much more vibrant and real the colors are in HD as opposed to SD, but when you get up close you can tell that the SD content is just grainier and more fuzzy around the edges, and you see more artifacts. From a distance of like 7 feet though, you can't tell the artifacts are there. Of course, this is all somewhat dependent on your cable/satellite provider.I have a PS3 so I can attest to how incredible games like Metal Gear Solid 4 and Rock Band look AND sound! MGS4 will have you thinking that they're real people and the gorgeous environments really shine on these TV. The otherwise mundane backgrounds in Rock Band look really real on this TV. I watched some Seinfeld episodes from DVD on my brother's TV (he has a 46\" series 7) and it's like a totally new show! I also have a couple of Blu-ray movies (Kill Bill 1 & 2), which output 1080p with PCM 5.1 sound, and it seriously felt like when I first saw the movies in the theater. Obviously, the screen isn't as big, but the experience with the picture quality and the sound made me forget that I was even watching it in my living room at times. I really flipped for how perfect the colors were, which proves how great Blu-ray is and how well this TV can handle it. (note: I have my PS3 connected via HDMI, which is really the only way to go)I do have a couple of gripes though. The whole dlna thing does not work for me at all. I have Vista Home Edition and whenever I try playing video on the TV using their crappy software from my computer, it always errors out (it doesn't crash the TV, just that application). The remote is not the best. The button layout doesn't always make the most sense, and the clickwheel is terrible. Fortunately, it is a clickwheel so you don't have to spin it around, which is really painful. The remote feels kind of cheap, but at least it has a backlight.As you can see though, those are pretty minor things. The Info Link feature is pretty neat and lets me see what the weather is every morning so I can dress appropriately. The TV looks very stylish, and I don't even see the \"touch of color\" around the edge (though the picture refracts a bit around the edges). It has a TON of options if you really want to tweak it to your liking, but it's not always easy navigating through these menus.Overall, this TV is ridiculously high quality. It was my first real TV purchase ever and I'm so glad I made it. It was a lot of money for me to give up, but I reasoned that it was better going with quality than a cheaper TV that I'd have to replace a couple of years later. This TV will last me a long time (after all, not everything is in 1080p now, so even if they end up with something better later I don't think it'll be very popular until after this TV has outlived its usefulness). I work hard so it's really nice to come home and relax and know that no matter what I watch on this TV that it's going to look great and I'll be treating myself. I know it's just a TV, but after a hard day it's still a nice perk.", "Date": "September 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Terrible delivery", "Author": "D.

This one kept getting great reviews and all the outstanding post here convinced me to get it.  I was afraid to wait to much longer because the prices might go up for Christmas...so I took the plunge.  It was delivered in Record time.  Ordered on July 31st...delivered on 7 August.  CEVA was nice to my mother-in-law...but didn't take it out of the box like they are supposed too.  But hey she didn't ask them to either and it was free delivery.  I'm just hoping my wife looked this over real good and there are no dead pixels...but she is enjoying it.The 30 day price guarantee is awesome too.  I have already received over $40.00 back and still have 14 days left.

Because the prices of LCD's are way over the top here, my girlfriend and I decided to purchase this online. Why not? I mean; price cannot be beaten, Blue-ray included, what's not to like? Well, enter CEVA. They delivered it to the freight forwarder company that I use with the wrong consignatary name, signed in by a person that apparently did not worked there, did not took responsability for the error and well, after a couple of nightmarish weeks I was able to track my LCD.Beside that horrible experience, the LCD is a wonder. Stylish, stunning image for Blue-ray and PS3 and even though the broadcast signal is not great, it's what happens when you switch from regular TV to LCD.Bottom line:hands down choice for an LCD.CEVA: PLEASE NO.", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "DLNA the main feature of this TV really sucks!!", "Author": "G.

I preferred 7 series compared to 6 series exclusively for DLNA support to avoid lot of audio and video connections from my desktop. Once I got the TV I got to my knowledge that the Digital Media Player (embedded within the TV) doesn't support seek - i.e. cannot forward or rewind during playback from the DLNA server. Any simple player is supposed to have a play, pause, stop, rew and fwd. If any one of these are missing, it's totally useless. Hence I want to give only 1 star for this product. Sony Bravia DLNA gives you options for fwd and rewind during DLNA playback - I think extra buck for sony DLNA really worth it. I will not recommend any samsung TV for DLNA as they wont support rwnd and fwd.", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "no swivel base", "Author": "A.

I have been unhappy since the very begining when AMAZON informed me that it was not covered under their \"White Glove\" program because I didn't request it. I received this unit from the Post Office.  It arrived upside down in a Postal cart (that's when I knew \"White Glove\" wasn't a working option here). AMAZON told me I had ordered it from someone else on their webpage therefore it wasn't covered, now tell me why would I do that? I made several calls and no one would listen, therefore I went to their installation sales people (at an additional cost) and had someone come 120 miles who didn't want to be here in the first place and install this TV.  It still doesn't work properly unless you like fat streached out people with their heads cut off.  I'm sure the TV must be good or why can they sell them to us Yokels who live in Rural America but can't get anyone to install it properly?I suggested AMAZON had changed the order because they didn't have any \"WHITE GLOVE\" service to rural American - They denied this, but you know what, I didn't believe them, we don't have any \"White Glove\" people in this area.Rural America look out, and actually I came from a big city so I'm not a local hick.
