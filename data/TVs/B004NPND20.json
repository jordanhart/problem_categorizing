{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best TV currently on the market.", "Author": "Jigsore", "ReviewID": "R139TZZYKSG328", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had researched for about a year or so before placing a pre-order for this set. In 2010 I purchased a 55 inch Samsung C8000 LED set, and had bad luck with two units which were unrepairable, and needed to be replaced. Finally I got one without a problem, and it looked pretty great with bright content, but in blacked out scenes, or letterbox content there was a \"flashlight\" and cloud effect that was just too distracting. This is in a completely dark room by the way. It was at this point that I decided I was going to buy the best TV on the market with little regard to cost, and almost everything I read led to the upcoming VT30. So I placed my order in April, and the set was delivered on May 13th. Immediately I was blown away by the picture quality of this set, but also noticed a \"flicker\" effect, almost like the picture was fluttering on the high contrast scenes. For about the first month of owning the set I can't tell you how much reading and research I did to see if there was a way to fix this flicker problem, and although there is a lot of info on the web about this set, it seems like nobody was addressing the flicker issue. So I thought it must just be me, but then I found an article that talked about the greyscale of PDP technology, and that it can cause flicker which only some people see. I know that my vision is good, but could this be a problem with Plasma? Is it just me? Is it the settings of the set? Well, it couldn't be the latter, because I had tried just about every settings combination possible, and nothing had worked. When the contrast was turned down low it did reduce the flicker effect, but never went away and made the picture too dim to really enjoy. The picture quality on this was so good that I was heartbroken to think that it would go back because of this issue, after all, for this kind of money I expect near perfect results as I don't make this kind of purchase every day. So before returning the set I bit the bullet, and forked out the money to have a professional calibrator come out and adjust the settings in the TV's Service Menu. This is a menu that you can access with the proper codes, and is intended only for professionals to tweak the color, greyscale, light output, etc. on the set. Turns out that the set needed the calibration badly. I have never had a professional calibration on a TV before this, and although I figured that it would be a good idea, I never realized just how much difference it could make! The picture quality was already the best I had ever seen, but after professional calibration it is absolutely mind blowingly good! The flicker is gone, the picture is bright, but subtle, and tons of detail in the shadows. Black areas of a scene are pitch black, and colors are incredibly accurate. I almost want to miss work just to stay home and watch TV now. I have Comcast HD, and although it is pretty good in my neighborhood, you just can't beat a Blu-Ray on this thing. In fact, the calibrator that dialed in my TV has a Pioneer Kuro, and has calibrated up to an 11 Million dollar home theater, and his opinion is that there are a lot of great sets to choose from with Panasonic, Samsung, LG, etc, but he agrees that the VT30 is the best you can get right now.  If you can afford it, I highly suggest that you take a good look at this TV before you make the leap.  By the way, the Samsung LED that I referenced above is now in a bright room, and looks phenomenal. The Samsung D8000 is a pretty awesome set for 2011, and until the calibration I thought I was going to end up that direction, but it also has the flicker effect, and I have had bad luck with two Samsung TV's, and two of their Blu-Ray players in the past. Not sure how reliable they are this year, but I'm pretty sure that the Panasonic was the right choice.Update: The fluctuating brightness issue on these sets that some people are talking about was on a small number of the initial units released. It has been addressed, and fixed. You will not have a problem with fluctuating brightness from this point forward.  Also, I saw the new Elite sets from Sharp and the VT30 is still definitely the king of the mountain.

A previous amazon customer who wrote a review here mentioned his recently acquired (sept 2011) tv was a July build.  amazon, on the phone, could not guarantee me any build date, I guess I got luck of the draw on August, which apparently all August and beyond tv's have a replaced A board from the factory -- there is changing information on this on the 'net forums.I was also a bit reluctant to purchase from Amazon, as I've never purchased something this expensive online before, but I've purchased from Amazon for years and have ZERO negative to say about Amazon reliability and service -- it's always been impecable.I received this this tv only 2 days after I purchased it from Amazon, it arrived in great condition, my wife was home and she didn't know to ask the gentlemen who delivered it to put it on the stand, but they did not offer to do this for us.  They turned it on, made sure it worked, and left (they just removed the top part of the box, pulled the styrofoam wrap down a bit, and plugged it in).I got home, plugged in the wifi, updated firmware from 2.060 to 2.070 witout any problems.I must admit -- for the purpose of this review -- so far I have not done any major testing.  I currently own a Panny TC-P65S2 (2010) and came from a Panny TC-P65S1, and have only owned panasonic plasmas.  I have dealt with fluctuating black levels (and am annoyed by them) on the S2, and the VT30 was a great prospect when I heard about the great black levels, apparently stable (thus far in reports from professional testing, i.e. cnet).I'll report back as I start playing around with this thing.  I gave it 5 stars because I did not want to lower the average rating.I can already tell the black levels are much better than the S2, the one sheet of glass is very cool, it's 1/2 or 1/3 the depth of my s2 -- very thin for a 65\" plasma.  The brushed aluminum trim is also a nice touch.Oh, and no buzz compared to my S2 .. my S2 can get rather loud, but this thing has no significant buzz - you can hear a little when you're a few feet away from it.******Final review:My EEPROM number is 84.46 .. this is an August build, Serial MJ1214XXXXX.  This has the updated a board/firmware, because I see NO FBr (fluct. brightness)Performance -- stellar (compared to my previous panasonic plasmas).This is clearly, without the 9G Kuro on the market, the king of plasmas.  I hope all purchasing from Amazon get the August build or beyond.  When I called Amazon, they could not guarantee me that, but they would guarantee that they'd return it no charge if I was not satisfied in 30 days.  Nothing touches Amazon's no tax price right now.Colors, black levels, \"pop\" .. all amazing.Sure, it's not a Kuro, but it's 90% there, and that says something.  I thought my S2 black levels were terrible once I got the tv and started using it.  For someone who will be doing dark room watching and CARES about black levels, fluctuating brightness, fluctuating black levels -- here's your tv.Thanks for reading.Update (all good) 11/28/11:This TV continues to impress me -- rock stable black levels and on brightness fluctuation issues (see my report above).  Will definitely continue to stay with panny for plasma as currently their plasma is the best on the market.

I did plenty of research before buying this tv and everything I read about this Panasonic VT30 series was correct.  It has wonderful blacks and can get plenty bright in certain modes.  I was somewhat concerned about the brightness issue given that my past flat panels have all been LCD.  I admit I was a fan of the overblown brightness modes that LCD's allow but it is far from the most accurate picture and affects black levels.  I had previously purchased a Samsung D8000 edge lit LED LCD but sent it back to Amazon because of the uneven back-lighting.  This TV shows no uniformity issues (as expected with plasma technology).  Watching sports on the Panny is great and 3D looks awesome also.  Black levels are amazing - there is no black crush that I can discern and I have barely adjusted any settings on the TV.The styling of the VT30 series is a definite plus.  I was considering the cheaper ST series but after I seeing the huge ugly bezel I couldn't settle for old school looks.  The VT one sheet of glass look is very well executed.  The panel is also slimmer than I was expecting considering this is a plasma. Also I have to note that there is no fan noise and no plasma buzzing which other plasmas brands are known for (Samsung).The Panasonic VT30 is a keeper.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "I wanted the best of the best, and I got it.", "Author": "JoeH", "ReviewID": "R3W5DKI91HX6YD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased my Panasonic Viera Plasma HDTV, model TC-P65VT30.  Purchased in January of 2012, manufactured in October 2011.  As of this review, I have had the TV for 2 days.  If you are looking for the best quality picture you can get on High Definition as of January 2012, the Panasonic Viera VT30 65\" is the way to go.  This is without a doubt, Panasonic's flagship television and an immaculate example of how amazing an HD picture truly is.Many of you who are reading these reviews care about the TV and technology you are getting.  Looking for every good and bad feature HDTVs have to offer.  Safe to say as well if you are reading this, money is no object.  Make no mistake, this is an expensive piece of hardware.  I will try and incorporate what I was looking for in reviews when I was narrowing down my selection.Before the VT30 65\", I was watching off a Vizio 32\" LCD/CCFL backlit-about 4 years old.  The picture on it was fantastic, and I never had any kind of problem with it. That in mind, Vizio was my first thought in Brand.  Personally, I don't care how good a review there is, Brands in electronics mean something to me.  Sony, Samsung, Panasonic and Vizio were the only brands I would truly consider.  First thing was first though; features.  What was I looking for that I knew about and what features did I find out about during research that I wanted?  In no order: 55\" or bigger/LED backlit full-array LCD/240hz or greater/WIreless capability/Apps/Social Networking where I can post right from the TV/Multiple HDMI ports/USB functionality/Industrial Design/User Interface/3D.  (The 3D option for me was NOT a major deciding factor.  If any models in my selection process had it however, the quality and ratings mattered.)Turns out, there are not too many HDTV LED full-array 55\"+ out there that had everything I was looking for and for a 'reasonable' price.  Most 55\"+ LEDs were edge-lit, which I did not want due to unbalanced light distribution.  The best TV I found after narrowing it down was the Vizio 55\" XVT3D554SV.  That was going to be it.  Everything I was reading online was great, only one problem: turned out I couldn't find a new model of it anywhere.  They were not making them anymore is what I gathered.  I did however see that this model was sold at Costco, so I went to take a physical look; maybe they had it.  They didn't, but after looking at the other TVs there, I saw a 60\" Samsung, model no. specific only with Costco.  Thing was, it was Plasma.I wasn't totally sold off Plasma from the beginning, I was just mildly afraid of 'burn in.'  My Dad has had a Panasonic 50\" Plasma for 6 years now, and that picture is still outstanding.  I was always jealous of it.  Yes, every now and then some images got burned in, like if we fell asleep to the Netflix screen on, etc.  It was never an issue though. All we had to do was turn on the TV without any picture, and the screen 'fixes itself.'  (Plasmas have come a long way too since my Dads, and have many new redundancies and settings to help prevent burn in.)After researching my new direction into Plasmas, I became very pleasantly surprised.  The way I look at it (after research), is Plasma is bar none the better picture;  the LCD market is trying to catch up and compare.  They are getting close but every review from customers, CNet, CustomerReports, -everywhere- prove Plasma is the best.  Plasmas had a much higher refresh rate (600hz), practically unlimited viewing angle, the deepest blacks/brightest whites, just as thin as the LED LCDs, and 3D ratings were completely incomparable to LED TVs; they blew them out of the water.  Once I made the crossover to Plasmas, I narrowed it down to 2 models:  the Panasonic Viera TC-P55VT30 or the Panasonic Viera TC-P65VT30.  The VT series is Panasonic's top models, offering many more features the lesser models lack, such as THX certification/settings, pixel orbiting, etc.I would like to point out, as pretty much everyone knows, if you want the best picture, Samsung HDTVs seem the way to go.  I kept that in mind, and wanted to go that route, looking at the Samsung PN59D6500DF.  In my research however, many customers were complaining about 'brightness pops', or FBR issues with their 55\"+ TVs;  Samsung and Panasonic alike.  (If you are unaware of what this is, just Google it)  Turns out, Samsung has not corrected this problem, and from what I read, does not fix these kind of problems historical.  Panasonic however, responded and fixed it with a software update/repair of the 'A board'.  (The repair would have been covered under warranty)  If your TV was made after Sept 2011, then it was already fixed.  So when all was said and done, I was back to either the Panasonic 55 or 65VT30.  I decided on the 55\".  After side by side comparison of specs, I noticed the two TVs had the same Native Resolution of 2,073,600 pixels (1,920 x 1,080).  I did not want a distorted/blown up picture, and from what I read and was told, 55\" is the largest you can go until your pixels start to stretch.  Knowing that, I decided on the 55VT30.I went to my Best Buy to take a physical look, and to purchase it.  Breathtaking. (Cool too, Tron Legacy was on)  Best Buy was sold out of the 55\" and needed to be ordered.  So really ready to buy a TV, I asked the salesman to show me the 65VT30 and clear any questions I had.  He demoed the HD picture from both a Blu-ray disc and Cable, as well as the SD pictures from cable and a DVD.  I was blown away.  The image was absolutely gorgeous, with NO notice of a blown up picture or anything less than amazing HD.  They had one 65\" in stock, so I took it.People, this TV is a thing of beauty.  As a design standpoint, the TV has one single sheet of glass making for a beautiful, no-interruption experience.  Installation couldn't of been easier, both for the physical set up as well as the on screen setup. It's a bit heavy, around the 140lb mark; my girlfriend was having difficulty helping me place it on the stand.  The picture is even sharper than I expected.  There is absolutely no distortion of pixels.  Panasonic's online 'HUB' called VieraLink is great too, however I cannot post Facebook statues' as I thought, I can only access it.  (as of now, anyway)Here is my only 'flaw' for this TV, which could be a considerable one depending on you.  It has to do with the picture and movement of some of the images.  I have never owned a TV of this caliber, so this could just be something that goes with having a TV of this size, watching to close, pictures settings, etc.  I can't really explain it, but the picture is SO good, that certain scenes where the camera pans, or when certain movements are made it's so smooth that it appears unnatural.  I've never come across this before, and need to do more research on this.  I can say this:  it makes the watching experience different.  Not better, not worse, just different.  If you have the option of going to a store and watching a program for a few minutes you will notice it.  I watched Avatar on Blu-ray and everything looks so crisp and so big, that when these movements are made, it feels like the images on the screen are sliding for lack of a better term.  It's really difficult to explain in words.  This TV deserves a 5 star rating.  I am only giving it 4 stars due to this 'panning issue'.  If I could, I would give it a 4.5 star rating.I have not tried out the 3D functions of the TV yet, and have only started to customize my picture settings.  I will be sure to update this review when I have more time exploring this TV and hopefully give a true final recommendation.  Any questions feel free!UPDATE: I hae solved the 'problem' I was having with the images being too smooth and unnatural looking. Turns out, this TV truly is loaded with features.  I can't speak For the 55VT30, but the 65\" comes with a 'Motion Smoother' feature. It does exactly what it sounds like. It has three settings;  off, weak and strong. My TV was set to weak. When I turned it off, the picture movements became normal again. Now, this is a five star HDTV. Unbelievable.I will continue to update as I dig deeper and try and other features, mainly the 3D.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kick-ass TV set.", "Author": "Nossy \"Nossy\"", "ReviewID": "R1DEZIED3OGV7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is probably one of the best TV (55 or 65 inch) you can get at the consumer level in 2011.  The Sony HX929, and maybe the PNXXD8000 Plasma are up there.  I have a problem with the Samsung plasma set sacrificing black levels in order to do 1080p24 properly.  1080p/24 is what these TVs are typically used for so that alone is a deal breaker.  The Sharp Elite is not even considered because it is too damn expensive.  I can take the money for the Sharp Elite and buy two 65vt30!For those who are on the fence about plasma technology and thinking that LED-LCD are \"the way to go.\"  I'd advise a high-end/midrange plasma set like the GT/VT series over any LED-LCD 240Hz unless you only plan to use the set during the day to watch Oprah and Dr. Phil.  If you plan to use your display mainly as watching awesome blu-ray movies - Plasma! Plasma!  Local-dimming LEDLCD sets like the Sony HX929 set are very good, but also cost $500-800+ more than an equivalent size high-end plasma set.  For home theatre purposes, I'd recommend staying away from edgelit LEDLCDs like Samsungs UNXX7000 or lower model.  The light bleed from those sets is horrible for watching movies (unless you only watch Avatar and Disney/Dreamworks cartoons).  I guarantee that if you let the wife pick out the TV, 99% of the time she will chose the Samsung LEDLCD over everything else because the color are very \"vibrant\" on the showroom floor and its very sleek bezel design.Viera Connect/Cast is an average interface.  The one big gripe I have is that it still uses the outdated Netflix interface and not the newer one where you can search.  Streaming HD shows on Netflix is excellent as long as you have a capable router and not too far away from the source.  I just don't understand why some people have problems unless they got a cheap wifi router or the tv is just too far from the source.  I streamed a few HD programs from Netflix and my guests mistakenly thought I was playing it from the Blu-ray player.  The quality is very good.Remote - Nothing special, does what it needs for TV viewing and configuring.  Not very good for Youtube and any kind of text entry unless you are super good at texting on the number pad.  Too bad it wont instantly recognize LOL and LMFAO.Picture Quality - Amazing.  The best part is that out of the box, the THX mode provides very good starting point for color accuracy and gamma.  So if you want to save $400 bucks, the THX mode for 3D/2D would suffice.  Most enthusiast will recommend proper calibration since this TV is made for calibration.  There's a software built-in that can only be access with proper equipments.  A certified ISFccc person will be able to optimally give you a night and day mode.Sound Quality - Average.  It definetly sound better than the Samsung TV sets, but nothing that will rival even a HTIB setup.EDIT:  A few weeks with this TV and I have to say:  BEST TV for the money.  You could make the argument that the GT series is a better value, but the PQ and design of this TV is worth the upgrade.  LED is still relatively new and not ready for prime time.  I am so glad that I exchanged the Samsung UN55D8000 for this.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simply Stunning", "Author": "R. P.

As I was saying, before buying this TV, I did a lot of research here and on home theater forums, cnet, plasma guide, etc. And most of them agreed that this TV had the best picture of 2011 and if not it was second, just behind the Samsung PND8000, So it was clear to me, that this tv was what I wanted, but the only \"little\" problem was the price, because my budget was no more than $1500, so I went with a less expensive set, also from panasonic the GT30 and it arrived with the screen totally broken, then I decided to go with the LG950pz and it arrived perfectly, but the image was very poor. Yep I was disssapointed so I decided to take the last shot and make the \"Big\" move and spend the $2300 I paid for this TV. And let me tell you that it is worth every penny, the image its simply incredible in 2d (I have not tried 3d yet, since Im not much into it)NFL games broadcasts looks amazing in game mode,but when you really squirt the picture of this TV is with Blu-ray, So far I have seen Thor, X-men, Life documentary and I am legend in blu-ray on the preset THX mode, and boy its sweetness to my eyes all the way. This TV has many possible picture adjustments, right now Im making a research on the best calibrations for this set, and I have found that most reviewers agree that the thx preset mode is great (of course for movies only) but still can get better with a few adjustments (which is not an urgency for me now). Another important matter is that this tv has none to little image retention, since I play a lot of xbox (fifa 11), so this was crucial for me too,(please note that the image retention comparison was made with my older tv, also a panasonic 50\" g25). And besides the stunning picture of this set, it's the sleek look of it, I understand that this issue is not that important for most people, but let me tell you that it will really make an impression in any home theater room.Conclusion is that if you can make the effort to buy this set YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT at any point, and if you cant, check out the ST30 model available at bestbuy, the picture quality is near this level, of course the case of the ST30 its completely ugly compared with the VT30.

I wanted a set that would perform and last for years to come as I don't spend $3,000 on a TV very often.The full glass sheet on the front is pretty nice.APPS--------The apps are a little cumbersome, but I didn't buy this for the apps.  I have an external media player with all that stuff, and it does a much better job.However, for those who don't have an external media player with apps like NetFlix, etc.., the built in apps and media player on this set will suffice.One side note though, is that the built in Panasonic media player struggles with some HD (1080p) .MKV and .MP4 files.I had one that was encoded/compressed to 8GB, and definitely saw a major stutter in it's playback.3D-----------IMO, the 3D on this set is far superior to the Samsung (as I said earlier, I've owned both).Not sure why, but on the Samsung, the sides seemed a bit blurry.  On this, every inch is clear and pops in 3D.To address those who have had issues with range on the 3D glasses:  I have the pair that came with it, and have been as far back as 20 feet with no issues.  I don't personally see a problem with the range.IR or BURN IN ------------NONE thus far.  I watch the news for a few hours/day (CNN and FOX) with the scrolling tickers, and haven't seen any at all.SOUND ------------The sound on the Panasonic is a bit better than the Samsung, but I don't really care as a TV of this caliber should really be teamed with a good surround system.If you don't have a sound system, believe me, the sound is good enough to get the job done.REFLECTION -------------Yes, the Samsung does have a little less reflection, but not by much.Keep in mind, that Samsung had to put what I refer to as an antiglare \"sticker\" on their sets.I have my Panasonic in my living room, and it's plenty bright.BRIGHTNESS FLUCTUATIONS -------NONE.  Mine has a January 2012 manufacturing date, and according to AVS forum and others, the issue has been fixed since August 2011.So if you do experience any brightness fluctuations, Panasonic will send a technician out to repair it with a new A chip and software.The 65VT30 is definitely my personal pick over the Samsung plasma, and for certain my choice over ANY High end LED TV for movies, sports, and gaming.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Review from an Audio/Videophile", "Author": "Basilt", "ReviewID": "R36OZZCPRLDZCC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not sure where to start with all of this.

The good.  Exceptional piture.  Dark blacks of course. But I really bought this for the 3D.  I had narrowed my choices down to the samsung pn59D8000 and the Panasonic p55VT30.  The 3D on the samsung looked a little artificial to me, that is like the cardboard cut out books that you open and they have one flat image after another.  The Panasonic however has a real nice graduation of 3D from front to back.  I really liked the new Samsung glasses, the bluetooth connection, light weight, large lenses, and even balance.  I still don't like the feel of the Panasonic glasses but they say they are comming out with better ones mid summer.  I don't like that Panasonic is still using infared since anything in the path of the beam cuts the 3D.  The feature that really wow's me is the 2D to 3D conversion.  Oh My God! the Panasonic is soooo much better than the Samsung in this respect.  I'd swear the 2D movies I've been watching with this feature are 3D.  It has minimum, medium, and maximum settings for this.  I like the medium setting which gives a lot of 3D without distorting the 3D effect like the maximum setting does.  My local dealer did a good job of matching internet prices and free delivery and set up.  The spider stand on the D8000 was really flimsy in real life.  So I like the Panasonics heavier but more solid pedestal better.  I wanted to buy the VT25 from last year but was still disappointed in the amount of light loss when putting on the 3D glasses.  This year the amount of light loss is much much less than last year, even tolerable.  Sound is actually pretty good but I still run it through my Denon 7.1 surround system.  Another thing that steered me away from the Samsung were all the reports of poor customer service on displays that went out.  I wish Panasonic would slim the bezel down more, and go to a wireless glasses recharger.I have both the Samsung BD-C6900 Blue-ray player and the Panasonic BDT350.  Love the Samsung, hate the Panasonic.  The Panasonic is not as user friendly, not as pretty, takes forever to load, and makes alot of clicking/humming/buzzing noises when playing a disk.  It didn't start out that way but it's been less than a year and already it sounds like a five year old player.  The quality of picture produced by each player is basically a wash for me.  I really can't tell any difference.  I'll try to update this as I get more experience with the TV.  Oh by the way - I'm not a football fan but watching it in 3D is like being on the field, incredible. And I was just told buy my sales person that there has been a price drop on the current set of 3d glasses.  They are now available for $49.99UPDATE: 07/12/11 I've bought two additional 55\" ST30's so I can put them side by side as part of an \"eyefinity\" setup on my computer.  The ST30's are suprisingly pretty good but I had to go through one return due to one looking grainy (a known not uncommon issue with panasonics in general and the ST30's specifically).  Now if they can only get rid of the bezel.UPDATE:  Well first day and already its gone bad.  I got the vertical black bar that covers about an eighth of the screen about 3/4 of the way on the right side.  In researching similar problems it might indicate the Plasma Display Panel (PDP) was defective.  It appears I have a vertical block that is bad. Retailer is getting me another one tomorrow.UPDATE:  Ok new TV working well.  On the standard picture setting its really too dark.  So I increased the brightness by changing to game or cinema.  I've been watching 2d movies with the 2d to 3d conversion with good results.  I just watched my first real 3D movie \"Tangled\".  I have seen the 2D version of this movie about 5 times but watching it in 3D is like seeing it for the first time.  WOW!  I'll never be able to watch it in 2D again.  The details are amazing.  You notice every blade of grass, every leaf on the trees, every strand of hair on people, all sorts of things I've never noticed before like birds flying in the fore and background, butterfies and pollen, textures on just about everything!  The only negative I see in 3D is when somthing moves fast like a swinging arm.  I don't know if its motion blur or just me not being able to focus fast enough. The picture is brighter and clearer with better 3D than I've seen in the theaters. I have a 2009 Samsung 63\" plasma which I still like the 2D bright, clear, sharp picture of over this Panasonic.  But for 3D I'm quite satisfied.  I also use this set as my main computer monitor.  It's fun to watch online movie content with the 2D to 3D conversion active.UPDATE:  The way I see it the ST30, GT30, and VT30 are basically good, better, best.  The best way for me to describe the picture quality difference is similar to watching a 60hz refresh rate and then watching an 80hz refresh rate.  The picture just seems clearer, sharper, and more stable.  Now the thing that really suprised me was watching 3D on the ST30's.  It was as good as the VT30.  In fact I had a really hard time trying to tell the difference.  So is it worth the difference in price?  Hmmmm hard question to answer.  As you can see even though I have the money for three VT30's, I opted for one VT30 plus two ST30's and I'm happy with the results.  I tried the apps and they are great but all the ones I like wanted money.  I guess I'm not ready to pay for them.  As far as the 55\" being big enough to watch 3D, yes, in fact for movies I have to back up a little from my usual four foot distance to a six foot distance to get the whole thing in my fileld of view.  I know people out there probably think its insane to sit so close, but I really like to immerse myself in my movies and games and the hd quality of both the VT30 and ST30 allow me to do that.UPDATE:  07/26/11  The 63\" Samsung I was mentioning earlier that I liked so much has started to fail after 17 months.  A $3600.00 then top of the line set that bragged about how long they were supposed to last.  Luckily I read many of the Amazon.com reviews on the Samsung flat screens and bought a two year extended warrenty.  I just don't understand all the failures on the Samsung and Panasonic TV's.  It's like they have no quality control going on in the factories.Update: 08/02/11  The $350.00 repairs on the Samsung 63\" are done and the picture is back to looking amazing.  I say wow everytime I see it.  I mention this for people who are trying to decide between Panasonic and Samsung.  After watching the repairs I could have done it my self for a $40.00 part and 15 minutes of work.  It was that easy.Update: 12/20/13  Two and a half years and the scan card goes out.  Really disappointing.  Finding a replacement card is extremely difficult.  Huge initial cost and a TV that only lasts 2.5 years.  Trying to get Panasonic customer service to respond is painful and frustrating.  I'm really going to have to give some of the other manufacturers more consideration for a future replacement.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointed - the VT30 should come with a warning...", "Author": "CDM \"Cdm\"", "ReviewID": "R39HYWLEWDER0H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Be aware that the VT30 series has an anti-glare coating on the outer screen.  While that may seem like a good idea, understand that this coating can easily be scratched, and there is no remedy.  Per Panasonic, there is no way to repair visible scratches without further damage to the coating.Let this be a warning to previous owners of Panasonic plasma TVs.  Our previous 50\" Panasonic plasma, which was mounted in the identical area, was impervious to scratches and abrasions.  The screen still looks flawless after 5 years.  The new VT30, in less than a day, is already scratched. We're not even certain how it may have happened.The picture quality looks brilliant. But Panasonic should take careful measure to inform customers that the coating is extremely fragile.  This would not be a good choice of TVs for a game room, around children, or for that matter, anywhere anything might come in contact with the screen.UPDATE:Watching the Oscar Awards this evening, and WHAM, just like that, the picture went black. The set will not power up. The red light on the front of the set is blinking in a series of 14 blinks, pause, 14 blinks, etc. The set is only 3 months old.

It has very good image quality, all the latest features, and as an added benefit, it's not outrageously expensive.Flat-panel TVs always look light and compact, but many folks are surprised by how bulky and heavy these products are. The 65\" VT30 comes in a box that looks like it could hold a medium sized motorcycle, and at 167 pounds, it's not that much lighter. Unfortunately, I didn't opt for white glove delivery, and my son and I ended up carting the thing up a flight of stairs - no easy task for something this size...in the end, I actually purchased a small hand truck to help, but that's another review... :)Out of the box setup is pretty straightforward. The TV comes with a matching stand, or you can use your favorite wall mount - just be sure to use one certified for a TV this heavy, and be sure it's really well attached to your wall studs. In my case, I used the included stand and the TV sits nicely on some cabinetry in my theater room.Although the TV has a wide range of inputs, in my case I just have a single HDMI cable running from my AV receiver (the excellent Pioneer SC-57) to the TV. All of my video sources pass through my receiver - it upscales everything to 1080p, feeding a nice steady signal to the VT30 over a single HDMI 1.4 cable. To take advantage of some of the VT30's features, you'll want to have a receiver and cables that support ARC (Audio Return Channel) - more about that below.The other wire you'll find running to my TV is a cat-6 Ethernet cable. Yes, we've reached the day when even your TV needs to be Internet connected, and with the VT30, you get lots of cool features this way. One of the best things is Amazon's on-demand video library...you just connect the TV to Amazon, and the full library is available right on your TV, including all of those free movies available to Amazon Prime members. Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and lots of other services are available, too.Although the VT30 comes with a wireless network dongle to connect to your WiFi network, I've had more luck running a dedicated Ethernet cable between the TV and the network. Using the wireless, I'd sometimes get movies that would lock up or pixelate - not even a single instance of that since I switched to a wired connection.The Internet services are also where that ARC (Audio Return Channel) comes in. With this feature, content you receive through the TV (say, an Amazon video) feed the audio signals \"backwards\" to your home theater setup. Without it, you'd have to be content to just listen through the TV's built-in speakers, or you'd need to feed the audio outputs from the TV separately into your home theater system...with ARC, it all happens over that single HDMI cable. As an aside, all the other HDMI control functions work smoothly, even though I have two different brands communicating...when I turn off my Pioneer receiver, the Panasonic TV goes off as well (and vice-versa).As for picture quality, it's quite good - better than any LCD I've seen, and nearly as good as the best plasmas. I own one of the legendary Pioneer Elite Kuro plasmas, and I have to say that the overall image quality from the VT30 isn't quite as good...the Kuro manages to paint a picture that's incredibly detailed, but smooth. The VT30 is probably equally detailed, but I find it slightly \"edgy\" - almost like a TV with the sharpness set too high. Don't get me wrong - it's a wonderful picture, especially with 1080p content...it's just not quite equal to the Kuro (and in fairness, the Kuros were quite a bit more expensive - and are no longer being made). If you're a fanatic like me, I'd recommend a good professional calibration for your new VT30. The out of the box picture was quite good, but a serious calibration visibly improved the picture.The remote control is okay but not stellar. More promising is the iPad remote control...although it still has a way to go, it's an interesting idea: for many functions, you activate an on-screen display and then you slide your fingers around on the iPad to interact with the icons on the TV. This is handy when wearing your 3D glasses since the 3D glasses tend to make your iPad's screen impossible to see.As for the 3D, well, I'm not sure I'm a huge fan - although the VT30 isn't the culprit.First, Panasonic includes one pair of 3D glasses, so don't forget to order enough for the family.The glasses are okay in terms of comfort and performance. They require power and are rechargeable...I get about 20-30 hours of viewing on a charge. There's a definite limit to how far from the TV you can be for the glasses to work properly. In my setup, I find about 20 feet is the max...more than that and you require some type of IR repeater. I find that you also need to be in a fairly dark room for the 3D effect to work well. Bright light - especially reflections off the screen - make the 3D seem unnatural. And of course, there's some loss of performance in terms of image quality. Bright, saturated and vivid 2D titles tend to look rather washed out in 3D, at least to my eye. To be clear, I believe these issues are found in almost any 3D products, so I'd view it as more criticism for the format than anything specific to the VT30.There are also some rather amazing 3D capabilities, such as a feature that \"adds\" 3D effects to 2D content, such as regular broadcast TV shows. The effect isn't as dramatic as you get with content that's been recorded in 3D, but it's still pretty amazing to watch (say) a sporting event in pseudo-3D, even though it's not filmed or broadcast that way.Overall, the Panasonic VT30 line is among today's best performers, and I don't think you'll go wrong with it - especially at the price.

The delivery was quick and the two delivery men helped unpack the TV to make sure it was working..

I can not say enough good things about the service from Amazon or the quality of the TV.On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate Amazon a 10 and the TV a 10.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice television even though set received is defective", "Author": "crafty congestion", "ReviewID": "R221KK23DWXE24", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "NOTE: The rating given for this TV is NOT for Amazon's service, the delivery company's service, or Panasonic in general. The rating is just for the TV but I will include other comments below in order to help those planning to buy the TV from Amazon.The TC-P55VT30 Television: I did some research and settled on this TV. It replaces an older Samsung Plasma which was good but had problems of its own. This new TV's screen is about 4-5 inches larger than the Samsung, but thought that was manageable with my room size. Unfortunately, the Panasonic TV I received is defective and I am awaiting a replacement from Amazon. The defect is that part of the panel appears \"turned off\" -- the very right side of the panel is black and has no picture. It covers around  10% of the very right side. The TV is out of stock right now but I'm hoping Amazon gets stock and can replace the set soon.From what I've used of the TV, it's pretty nice. Menus are laid out well and all my equipment works fine through HDMI so far (DVR, PS3, HTPC, Receiver, etc). I played around with the settings and have been able to get a fairly decent picture. Granted, I'm no video perfectionist and no expert in making those \"ideal\" settings but I like tinkering and finding the best picture for my eyes (not totally satisfied yet). There are a few quirks I'm still trying to work through, one being a strange black screen that appears sometimes when the screen goes completely black -- almost looks like a lot of very light colored squiggly lines across the screen for a second. I've noticed it before a commercial break sometimes when screen goes black (DVR) or when a movie is starting up and movie studio logos are appearing on screen (PS3/blu ray). Could be HDMI cables, might try switching them out at some point. Also could be signal issues from the source, but I never noticed it on my Samsung. Daytime viewing is not too bad - but the TV is in a fairly bright room so there is some deterioration there.I have not tested the 3D features yet. Have no desire to use it, but will eventually try it out and comment later.I will include more comments as I use the TV and its other features, especially after the replacement TV arrives.Delivery Company (Pilot): Not great. The set was due to be delivered between 12-2pm on a Tuesday. The time window went by, it never showed up so I called Pilot at 2:15. The service rep sounded very disorganized and didn't seem to know what was going on. Turns out, the TV was never out for delivery, they simply forgot and she said it was likely due to young people working there and a new scanning system. I could do nothing but laugh. They said they'll deliver it the next day and would call to confirm the time it would show up. Next day... no call. Decided to just wait it out and would call later if no one showed up. TV finally arrived around midday.Panasonic in general: Even though I pretty much knew the TV was defective, I did call the Panasonic customer service line just to see if there was some wacky setting that was off making the TV look the way it did. Panasonic rep was not very knowledgeable and basically said it was defective. I didn't want to waste time with them, so I ended the call. I've owned other Panasonic products in the past and it's pretty hit and miss (as far as if I like them or not). My much older TV (before the Samsung) was a Panasonic LCD Projection set which was ok but developed a lot of dead pixels over the time I had it. That was one of the reasons I did not go with Panasonic with the next set.Amazon in general: Amazon has been terrific through it all. They were helpful during the delivery fiasco. They gave me credits for my troubles and that was appreciated. When I called to set up the return, the Amazon rep was helpful. The only (minor) negative comment I have about Amazon right now is their inability to get a replacement set out due to stock issue. The TV appears to be available at many other online stores right now, but I'd rather not get a refund and order elsewhere due to Amazon's good price and return policy.Will update this review when replacement set finally arrives and write about how the return goes and how the new set looks/works.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic TC-55VT30 WOW!!!", "Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "R6V2S63X6U0JV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my TV 3 weeks ago and all I can say in UNBELIEVABLE.

I have played 3D games on PS3 and I was blow away again (Mortal Kombat & stardust HD).

I showed friends a scene from under the sea where fish seem to be swimming in your living room and everyone was amazed.

LCD/LED's each had their own set of issues. Edge lit, back lit, light bleed, halo effect, off angle viewing, fragile front screen, non deep black levels and jittery 3D.

Very smooth images without any flicker in fast motion. I also play 3D games on the PS3 and I am blown away.The speakers are not bad for regular TV viewing.

I do not notice it on the TV app. I have everything hard wired with a 30/ Mbps connection.But the rest of the Viera network is just so-so...

Some are silly, but the core apps (netflix, youtube, etc.) are very well done. The system for launching the applications and interacting with them are also nicely put together. However, I will still continue to use my Apple TV for netflix, youtube, etc. (the AppleTV just has a better interface).

BUT...Maybe I was naive, but I expected that the glasses would work more than 10ft away from the TV (they do not, and the pano docs confirm this).

My seating is a foot or so beyond the 10.5 feet, so I had to move my couches around to make it work (ugh). Not something I plan on doing regularly.

There are plenty of inputs and options for just about any possible use. If you want to spend this amount, I don't think you could make a better choice.

The LED also has the `soap opera' affect (i.e. when you're watching a movie, it looks like your watching a news program/reality show).  The Panasonic has a great picture, but the sharpness is muted...softer. The LED also has a very bright picture; it makes the Panasonic look darker.  The LED also has the `wow' factor.

All I have had to do is plug them in and use them.  The only thing better would be 75 or 80 inch.

If you are picky about your sound, you wouldn't be listening through anything but your audio system anyway = sound quality is not a big issue for debate on this TV.

Bought the TV at the end of September and I think the one I got was a post-brightness-fix set, and if not, I haven't experienced what other users have complained about.The screen image quality is pretty amazing.  Watched some 3D content on it and its looked pretty great.  The only complaints so far is that I was unable to figure out how to do 5.1 audio passthrough to my receiver.  I was putting both the audio/video into the TV via HDMI and then using optical to move the audio to my receiver (its only HDMI 1.3 so I can't go through it b/c it doesn't handle 3D), but it only seemed to deliver 2 channel audio.  I futzed with the settings some and finally gave up, running separate optical/HDMI lines to the receiver as needed. I would imagine there is some way to get 5.1 audio to pass through, but the way it is now, it works for me.Regardless, this TV is top-notch and the only real disappointment is the price tag.

I've owned the 65VT30 for 3 months now.  I purchased it for one primary purpose - 2D picture quality.  And the 2D picture quality is simply excellent out of the box (THX mode).  Having said that, I did have it professionally calibrated (by Chad B -[...[) and an excellent picture got even better - he does fantastic work.  My set (July build) has not had any of the issues mentioned by others, like fluctuating brightness, though for those with these issues, Panasonic has provided a fix.I did not buy the set from Amazon, so I can't comment on their customer service here (though I don't think customer service experiences should reflect on the rating of the TV itself).  I have not watched much 3D content, as there isn't that much out there that I care about, but what I have watched looks very good to me.  I didn't care about the bundled Apps, as I get that content from other sources like my Tivo and Oppo Blu-ray player, so I won't comment about that either.  I have a dedicated home theatre, so I have no opinion on the built-in TV speakers, other than such speakers have obvious limitations and I don't know why anyone would buy a TV in this price range and use the built-in speakers.In summary, the professional consensus for this TV is its the best, or second best, TV you can buy.

Wish I got 65\"...", "Author": "Enzo M.", "ReviewID": "R19T2NTHPEE967", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this set since October 2011 (so, not long) and I could not be happier with it to this point. I watch a lot of blu-ray movies, standard DVDs and NETFLIX on this television via my PS3 system which is connected to my Yamaha AVR by HDMI. From there its output via HDMI to the TV. Blu-rays mostly look fantastic (depending only on the quality of the source material on the disc) and have that somewhat 3D quality without actually being 3D, the images pop and have great definition. I love movies so many of my Blu-ray discs are ones that we're said or written to be of \"reference\" quality or \"demo quality\" and the picture is superb. Far, far better than my previous TV (a 46\" 2004 Sony 1080i CRT). I played MLB The Show '10 and Madden 2010 and the difference in image quality made it seem as though I had gone from a PS2 to PS3.  People on other sites (and this one) that have rated this TV talked about poor quality control at Panasonic. I guess some people's sets had buzzing from the TV but my set arrived in pristine condition and if I put my ear near the back panel of the TV, I do hear a low level buzz but I do not hear it from where I sit during movie watching. My set has an August 2011 manufacture date, some earlier build dates had issues that I believe had been fixed by August but if you get a set built before that date that has any performance issues, I understand Panasonic will replace a few internal parts to compensate and bring yours up to date and in line performance wise. To this early point I couldn't be happier with the picture quality, build quality, condition and features of this TV but again, this is only day two. I've used NETFLIX via the Viera Connect features and it worked great but is slow to load/respond compared to the NETFLIX app on my PS3. I haven't tried any of the other Viera Connect apps but I will. Based on the performance I've seen so far, I would highly recommend this TV to anyone and if you can spring for the 65\" and have the room for it, DO IT! I would have if I had an extra grand to spend but sadly, I did not. If anything changes my early and initial review of this TV, I will update this review but if not, I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this TV in spite of its somewhat higher price. Oh, and to those who complained about the TV being to dim or dark especially in a brightly lit room, I live in a studio apartment with windows on either side of the space and I do not have any problem with the picture quality whatsoever. I do have the drapes drawn closed but there's still plenty of daylight in my room. True, It isn't as bright as the LCD/LED TVs but I feel the overall picture is more accurate and truer to life which is what I wanted. I'm very happy.For anyone interested, I have it mounted on an Omnimount Modena 55FP 55\" TV mount/stand, I have a 9.5\" tall center channel speaker on the top glass shelf and the very bottom of the TV just clears the very top of the speaker. The speaker does not block the power button or the IR (remote) receiver (perfect!). I mention this for anyone considering this TV or a stand to mount it on if wall mounting is not an option. Also, the mount that comes with this stand can also be wall mounted if your set up changes so that's a bonus.***UPDATE*** 10/19/11. So it's been about two weeks now and I am loving this television. HD cable content looks fantastic but I have noticed that standard definition channels only look so-so. That might sound odd and as if I'm expecting SD to look almost as good as HD but even without such an expectation, I don't think this set does all that well with SD signals. Other than that one small CON, I can say that this TV has met or exceeded my expectations in most regards and I have not experienced any problems or issues to this point. It also looks great and fits perfectly on that Omnimount stand I mentioned earlier in this review. Games from my PS3 look exceptionally crisp and clear, my girlfriend and I were watching football this past Sunday and she mentioned a couple of times that some aspects of the actual games we watched reminded her of how good Madden on the PS3 looked while I was playing against my brother online. Awesome set. Can't wait to get it calibrated in a few weeks.***UPDATE*** 11/03/11. It's now been about a  month and to this point the TV is performing wonderfully. Thankfully, I haven't had any of the issues that some have had and posted in certain online forums. I can't find anything to complain about or nit pick with this TV. Great HD picture and even compressed streaming NETFLIX looks really good on it. For those who don't follow the forums and reviews or who haven't researched today's top TV's, this is a very highly regarded television in many respects. Without giving too much away, there's an electronics store in N.Y. that holds a yearly top T.V. contest (shootout) that has been gaining in popularity since they began doing it something like seven years or so ago. People either in or who have been in broadcasting, professional ISF calibrators as well as engineers from some of the manufacturers are always in attendance and they collectively vote on which of today's top TV's is #1, 2, 3 and so on. The manufacturer's engineers don't get to vote of course, I believe they attend to make sure their company's set got a fair chance, to see how their product fares and to possibly address any issues, faults or what have you with their company's respective sets. Each of the sets is professionally calibrated before the shootout begins so the playing field is level. The Panasonic TC-P65VT30 (I have the 55VT30, same T.V. just smaller) placed second only to a $5,500 Sharp Elite LED/LCD TV. Samsung's PN-D8000 plasma placed third. Just a little perspective as to how good the Panasonic plasma is although it was followed VERY closely indeed by the Samsung.***UPDATE*** 11/26/11. Two months in and I don't know if it's because the pixels have aged or \"burned in\" but the picture quality seems to have improved somehow and to my eyes the blacks have become visibly better/deeper. I haven't had a single problem with this TV in spite of any issues I've read about. I'm loving this set and the one thing I've realized is that not once since I've owned this TV have I felt or thought that I could have spent my money more wisely than on the VT30. The Samsung PN59D800 is another excellent set from what I've read and there are numerous and valid arguments for each sets virtues and flaws but I feel very confident that I got the best HDTV for the money I spent and have not looked back.***UPDATE*** 02/18/12. Five happy months of ownership now and I finally had my VT30 professionally calibrated on Saturday, February 11th 2012. It's exactly a week later and I can say, after watching the set for a week after the pro cal, that it was worth the extra money to have it calibrated. I wanted to wait before making a judgement call on the calibration because first, I knew I'd have to watch a bunch of different material before being able to accurately state whether or not there is a huge difference in picture quality and secondly, I didn't want to make a rushed judgement based on the reports I was given which showed the improvements in graphs etc. I wanted to report on the differences I saw with my own eyes, not the ones the reports told me had occurred. The calibrator set up ISF DAY/NIGHT modes for all four HDMI inputs and an ISF 3D mode for HDMI 1 and 2 inputs. The differences that I SEE between uncalibrated and professionally calibrated is like a thin layer of gauze or haze has been removed from picture. Before the calibrator started the actual calibration he completed a color luminance and color decoding update on the set and then began the calibration process which took about three and a half hours total. I re-watched a bunch of blu-ray movies and concerts that I had watched before the calibration and there is definitely a positive difference in the after cal picture. The luminance and color decoding obviously had a direct influence on the results but overall the picture looks punchier, cleaner, crisper, more detailed and has more pop than before. I'm very happy with the results and recommend a pro-calibration to anyone who wants to get the most performance out of this set, it's a no brainer really.***UPDATE*** 11/12/12. This set is still looking and performing fantastically. The resolution, the color (after pro calibration) and the images are still hugely impressive and I'm more than satisfied with my purchase a year later. I've had no issues with this T.V. No fan noise as others have noted, no green/pink blobs, no permanent image burn in, only minor temporary retention that goes away very quickly and that seems normal on these sets. Great T.V. My girlfriend and I love it and we still often remark about the great picture quality. Deep blacks, crisp, smooth images and great color fidelity (after pro calibration).

I've not owned an HDTV before.  I have spent 18 months reading reviews and scanning customer forums for Samsung, Panasonic, and Sharp.  The TC-65VT30 passes the eye test.  I had purchased a Sharp 70\" LED LC-70LED on ebay, but had not received it yet.  I went to Best Buy to actually see my purchase and the TC-60GT (which has the same plasma screen, but not all the extras of the VT series)was right next to it.  Even with 10 inches less screen size it blew away the Sharp.  My eye just kept going to that plasma screen.  The picture got BETTER the closer I got.  The LCD was blurry and pixelated.  The plasma was crystal clear.  Then my phone rang.  It was a representative from the store I had purchased my Sharp 70\" from.  He apologized sincerely and told me the Sharp was out of stock and he was refunding my money.  What LUCK I have!  I asked him in his opinion what HDTV was the best and he told me the TC-VT30 series plasmas.  I went home did a little more research and dropped the hammer on my new HDTV.  I thought it would be hot(according to reviews of plasma tv's), but it was not.  It was warmer than LCD/LED tv's but not melt my paint off my wall hot.  He's the deal on black levels and LCD/LED vs Plasma...black is the canvas all tv's start with to make their pictures.  LCD/LED tv's have a bright white light behind the canvas to project the image to our eyes so the colors, especially the blacks, look at first more vivid and crisp, but after about 10minutes you will notice that the colors, especially the blacks will be washed out, weak, and seem to merge a little.  Plasma is a gas encapsulated in a glass envelope. To make white color the plasma is turned full on. To make black it is turned off.  Black is really BLACK on a plasma and the colors are all separated and unique.  Plasma is real sugar where LCD/LED's are Splenda...there's a slight bitter aftertaste.To top off the excellent viewing, the VT30 series looks great turned off as well.  It has one sheet of glass covering the entire set.  There is also a metal band that goes around the outer edge of the bezel.  Don't take my word for any of this.

I was never ever going to consider plasma but there they were dancing in front of this Model TV at the store watching a Stevie Wonder concert. So I said lets give it a try. Out of the box this thing was a nightmare. My system was set up to be used on the right side of the TV. This TV's business end is far to the left side so I had to move my entire AV system. Then came the fluctuating brightness noticeable especially during any sporting event. Fixed this by using the THX mode. I was plugged into the ARC HDMI jack. Something about this TV communicates with my receiver and makes surround sound better. I'm not sure why. Next came split second flashes every 30 seconds or so watching basketball. Man I was disappointed and considered an immediate return where I planned on getting a Sony LED TV. But lo and behold to my utter amazement after about 20 hours of use the TV began to shine like no other TV I have ever seen at this size. All problems self corrected. I even had an appointment scheduled with the Geek Squad that had to be canceled. Allow this TV some break in time and I think you will agree the best TV is Plasma and the VT30 series is the best among them. I absolutely love the detailed rich color this set offers. Fine detail and crispness with out going overboard like my Samsung did where characters were looking like computer generated images. Use the THX picture mode setting or get it professionally calibrated. Just got through watching the final 4 college basketball games absolutely no flutter or flashes. No motion blur. Just near perfection. Yes it was an emotional roller coaster ride but well worth the lesson I learned. Have not tried wifi or the 3D mode. I'll watch the Avatar 3 D blueray and report anything that would be a concern. Right now I'm a happy camper. Panasonic Plasma HD TV-- me , no way. Yes way.

I am not a fan of LCD/LED smoothing techniques.SHIPPING was slow considering I ordered it on Tuesday and the first available date was Monday and after looking at the tracking it originated on the other side of the city. (I might have been able to call them and get it earlier but I did not check tracking until Friday).  They unboxed the beast and put it on the included stand and lifted it onto our Entertainment Center.  It has rubber pads on the bottom of the stand so you might want to put felt pads on the bottom if you want to get to the back.  I decided to keep the box they would have taking it away if I did not want it.  If you hang this TV make sure you mount it correctly with a massive mount, drywall by itself will not hold it.FIRST IMPRESSIONS it was a little grainy when I first turned it on, but I have not seen that after the setup screens.  The screen size is MASSIVE and the glass panel anti-glare is very nice (freaked out about scratches).  The delivery guys left finger smudges on the glass which they told me several times their sorry and make sure I use a microfiber cloth to remove them.  I used the AR glass spray from my glasses and its cloth and it came off without scratches.First Blu-Ray movie was amazingly clear.  I turned on 24p playback and setup the TV for THX screen mode no other changes.  My only other HD TV is an old 42 LCD with its best feature is changing the screen aspect ratio, so it's night and day between the two TVs.  I did notice not having the TV in THX mode the screen does fluctuate brightness if people are moving in the room or someone turns on the light in the other room.  So far the fluctuation in brightness (which I have seen is a problem in almost every TV that is \"ECO\" friendly has this problem) has not been too distracting and does seem to make the picture look a little dimmer than I would like.Once I have more time to play with the online tools I'll post more.

I love this TV but it took a while to get it up and running. I am a firm believer in consumer reports and how they rate electronics. In fact they rated this TV as one of the best. I purchased the TCP55VT30 and I could not be happier although there were a few snags. The TV was delivered on time by Amazon's delivery service. They unpacked it and I noticed that the back panel had three bends in it where the panel met the front of the TV, there were no marks on the box or any abrasions near the bends. I turnd the TV on and then noticed there was a 4 inch black line on the left hand side of the TV. I noted that on the delivery receipt. So, I was pretty much bumbed out because I waited almost two weeks for the item and I did not want to return it and go thru the entire process again and especially after reading on Amazon, that it would take three months to get a replacement. I called Amazon, they offered two options: returning the item or taking a 10% refund. Well I decided to take the refund and call Panasonic under the warranty. The people at Panasonic were very cordial and sympathetic about my problem. They arranged for a local authorized TV repair shop to come pick up the TV. The repair shop said that it could take a week to repair it because they would have to be on the phone with a Panasonic tech and go thru a step by step check of the TV. Well, the repair shop took the TV and the next day was called to tell me the TV was repaired. The problem was a part that was not plugged in all the way. That was an easy fix. The shop even repaired the back panel. You cannot even tell it was bent. Great job by repair shop. You kinda wonder why Panasonic does not have a better quality control system... they should have seen the bends in the back panel and should have noticed the 4\" black line on the right side of the screen. I had to email the pictures, delivery recpt, and descriptions of the problems to Panasonic. Now that I have the set properly functioning, everything works great. I have had it almost a month now and just downloaded the new software for the TV, it now connects to my laptop using my wireless network and I am running Vista home premium... what a shock (the instructions before the new software said that only windows 7 would connect!!) I read some other reports that the wireless feature did not connect if your router was more than 10 feet away... not true... my router is on the other side of my house and it connects just fine. I have streamed a few movies already and there has been no freezes. The 3D is awesome!!! I have watched a few 3D movies thru my cable company and the effects were unbelievable. Even regular TV can be switched to 3D. Love football in 3D mode and I prefer the max setting for sports because you get the most depth. I have used the SD card slot and the pictures are crisp and clear (I took them with a 14 mp camera) You can even see them in 3D if you so desire. One feature I really like is the built in sub woofer with the speakers. I was concidering buying a sound bar but after hearing the speakers and sub I dimissed that idea real quick. The speakers do not sound tinny like other models. The apps that come with the TV are good, you can download more if you please, there are some for free and some you have to pay for. One app I wish they included is Vudo, it appears to have more 3D movies available. Their 3D Blue-ray palyers offer this app. Since this is a rather new technology, cable companies are starting to get into it now. It is good because most need a TV manufactured in 2011 and not before because the technology has advanced. So, if you buy this TV you are all good. The glasses that come with the TV are good but I prefer the Xpando ones better, they seem lighter and the only draw back to them is they are run on batteries and not rechargable like the Panasonic ones. One last note: Amazon had the best price... I almost purchased the same TV at Best Buy and glad I did not because for less money at Amazon I got the Sanus wall mount, another pair of 3D glasses (Xpando), a 3D HDMI cable for the  3D Blue-ray I am going to purchase, wire concealment mount and some cable jacks.

However, I just had a very alarming experience with it that you should be aware of.  I had been playing mostly Call of Duty on my Xbox 360 in my home theater on a projector.  I decided to try it out on this TV instead in another room of my house because my theater projector bulbs are pretty expensive so racking up hours on it just to play video games felt like a bad idea.I played a total of about six hours of Call of Duty over a two day period, flipped it back to normal TV programming and during a commercial that was mostly white background, I noticed some of the stationary display items from call of duty had burned into the display!!  If you're familiar with the game, it was the kill streak / score streak notification icons along the right side.  Those are always displayed and always in the same spot.Fortunately I was able to run the TV's own internal screen wiping option and did three 15-minute passes.  A good bit of the burned in image artifacts are gone now.  I'm going to give it a few more days with normal programming and run the wipe a few more times and I'm really hoping it gets rid of the rest.So.... I would highly recommend not using this TV for video games if the games you play have a fixed location for any display items (scores, lives remaining, button bars, etc.); you will probably burn your screen in, and in what is not a very long period of time.Guess I'm going to go buy a cheap-o tv or projector just for gaming now.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV on the Planet - Bar None!!", "Author": "dsaratani", "ReviewID": "RBQQ9F29LOI02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've checked out all of the best TV's, Plasma, LED by the biggest brands: Panasonic, Sony XBR, LG & Samsung.

I have had this VT30 for almost a week. the picture is flawless, and the sound is considerably better than most tv's.

I received this TV from always a deal faster than I have almost any other delivery from amazon. And the thing is 150lbs.

I had purchased a 37 LED Panasonic 2 years ago and the performance of it has been great. When the 27 inch TV in my bedroom went on the blink, I had to decide whether to replace it with another 32 to 42 inch TV or buy my 65 inch and put the 37 inch in the bedroom (Tough decision wouldn't you say). When I saw the price of the 65VT30 was $42 under my buy price and I had confirmation that my tax return was in the bank, I quickly hit the purchase button.The TV was delivered a day earlier than Amazon said to expect it on. I went with the standard free shipping (couldn't see paying an exrta $100 to get it one or two days earlier) and when Home Direct delivered it (Enhanced delivery), the guys that brought it in, uncarted it from the box, assembled the pedestal stand (Information on Amazon says that they don't assemble the pedestal), placed it on my TV cabinet, plugged it in and turned it on to see if it was working. After they left, I installed all of the cables (5) from my SV-BT300 7.1 Channel Home Theater system to the back of this monster. Panasonic included every adapter cable that could be possible needed, making hook-up a breeze, they even added lighting on the remote so no more trying to figure which button to push in the dark! I would advise anyone to utilize HDMI cable instead of standard AV cables, if you never have tried them, the difference in image quality is unbelievable (Discovered it myself with the 37 inch TV) it adds depth to the scene, even cable TV. Next was initial set-up, the screen commands take you completely thru all of the simple steps (If you own another panasonic, you already know about this and the Viera capabilities). That was all there was to it.You can look at 65 inch TV's at all the local stores you care to, but until you have it set-up in your house, you cannot really anticipate just how big this TV is, all you can say is WOW!!!!!! I now have to wait for the BDT-500 to ship before I can enjoy the 3D portion of this wonderful TV (I will have to connect it to the BT-300 Blue Ray 7.1 channel Blue Ray for the audio). As for calibration concerns that I have seen reported, all I can say is that so far I don't see a problem in mine. I will need to tweak it some, but the quality out of the box is just fine.I am more than pleased with everything about this TV from purchase, delivery to performance. I would recommend this TV to anyone without reserve or question. The only con I have is with the placement of the coxial cable connection. It does not stick out the back like most every other TV. Instead of coming horizontally out of the back it is vertically placed downward, which makes connecting it just a little bit difficult (Gee wiz what a terrible con, a deal break I'm sure). I'm positive that the new models, 65VT50, performance is fantastic as well, but I could not see paying an extra $1,100 for the new model. If you're still riding the fence on whether to purchase either model, I recommend taking the plunge and jumping right on in.

Unfortunately, for the first time for me, Amazon has disappointed me with their service.Issue #1: The delivery service (Carrier) came in, dropped the box off in my living room and started to walk out the door.  When I informed them they were supposed to unbox the TV and ensure it was working and not damaged, they responded that people were telling that that all the time and that that wasn't part of the shipping.  I requested they contact their head office to check, they did and said unboxing wasn't part of the deal, but that they would do me a favor and unbox the TV for me but not turn it on or check it.  I got on the line with Amazon customer service for large items, who informed me that the only shipping possible with Amazon was the unboxing service, and very quickly contacted the carrier home office, and confirmed that they were supposed to unbox, plug in and test the TV (at this point in time I discovered issue #2 below).  The delivery guys unboxed and took stuff away, the whole time disagreeing that Amazon paid for unboxing.Issue #2: Part of the delivery service with this TV is what Amazon calls 'Enhanced Delivery'... which is deliver TV to room, unpack, and ensure TV is working properly and not damaged, and take away packaging materials.  What was NOT clear to me (unless you click 2 screens in and read 2nd to last sentence of 3 paragraphs, what I define as 'small print') was that Enhanced Delivery did not include attaching the base to the TV (considered installation).  Which is logical and HAD I BEEN AWARE, I would have made plans to deal with.  Handling a 65\" plasma weighing 125 lbs and a 13 lb base, is a non-trivial thing to do and takes a minimum of 2 people.  I called a friend dealt with it, but just imagine if this had been sent to someone without a strong friend to call upon.So, get the TV, I think you will love it, BUT if ordering from Amazon... (a) be prepared to assertively deal with delivery service mix-ups and (b) know that the installers will unpack and leave the TV leaning, you will need to put the base on it.  (I've made a number of suggestions to Amazon Customer to adjust the wording on Enhanced Delivery to make this clearer, as of 2/28/2012 wording is the same)", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bigger is Better", "Author": "john mackel", "ReviewID": "R21QXO8HTY6D4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My primary aim in buying this TV was simple. I wanted a TV that gave me a large viewing experience and had to give me a excellant picture. At first I didn't care if it had a 3D capability but finally I decided if I was going to get the best why not have 3D also. (and I'm glad I did, 3D is awesome) So, I did a lot of shopping around and decided this panasonic 65\" vt30 was the best. Prior to getting this panasonic I have two 46\" samsung LED. The samsungs have been great, both have excellant pictures and one now hangs in my bedroom and the other in a vacation rent house, but this panasonic is a real upgrade. First, the picture is fantastic. I will not go into great detail with pixcels vs whatever, but for example when you watch a football game it is like being there. Now I also see more detail in the actors face or details in the scene because everything is so much bigger and so sharp. Some of these reviews have mentioned light flickers and such but I did not experience anything but perfect. Second, the audio from the panasonic is a 1000% improvement over the samsungs. I have the Pan hooked up to a real sound system but before I hooked everything up and just watched it using it's own internal speakers  the audio was first class. I love this TV and it has not disappointed me.Next a few comments about buying from amazon and the shipping. I am a person that looks for a deal. I worried about this but I purchased this item from the amazon warehouse as used but \"like new\". As far as I can tell it is a \"new\" TV. It came in the original box and had no defects on it. And I checked it out very carefully. Second I did not experience the situations where the delivery guys stayed and helped me set it up and made sure it worked. My guys were good and I had them carry it upstairs to my gameroom but that was it. I wanted them to stay until I got it out of the box and made sure it worked but that was not going to happen. They had other places to go and it was sign and if I had a problem, \"ship it back\".Last let me say, I don't work for panasonic or own any stock in amazon. I read almost everyone of the reviews about this TV before I purchased it. I also purchased the panasonic 310 Blu-ray and some extra glasses and I did it thru amazon because they gave me the best deal and beleive me I made numerous trips to BB and sears.

I started with a 65\" LED display, which although bright, was very underwhelming in color accuracy and black levels. Round two involved the DLP route, which improved on black levels, but in it's place I got 'hot spots' and disappointing daytime viewing. Then this set arrived, and I finally have everything I want in a TV.PROS:1. Black levels are unmatched. I looked very, very carefully, and I could never spot the light source or detect any type of light bleeding, even with white text on a black background. Amazing.2. Zero input lag. I first played my PS3 games using THX mode, and was very happy.  I could detect no input lag.  When I switched to Game mode, supposedly the mode made for gaming, the only difference I could tell was a brighter/cooler picture, again, with no input lag. I can't tell you the amount of hours I've spent tweaking my LED/LCD display to provide an acceptable level of gaming lag.  With this set, it's effortless out of the box.3. Color accuracy. I've had this set at THX mode since I purchased it, and I honestly don't see any reason to start tweaking it. Colors are amazing and varied, the contrast levels are perfect.  The only, very minor issue, is you don't want all windows open with THX mode. It's definitely watchable, as I'm doing right now with no issue, but you have to be mindful of the ambient light.  Simply bumping the brightness a few notches easilly solves this issue.  This is a very, very bright TV, that is unfortunately poorly set up in most store displays. Don't let Best Buy dissuade you, trust me, this screen performs extremely well in daylight.4. The design. Wow. It truly is the centerpiece of my apartment. Some have described it as a 'huge Iphone'. That's farily accurate. The single sheet of glass looks downright slick, and the base (should you choose to use it) is extremely solid and much more stable than say, for instance, LG Infinia's 65\" set.  Despite being a single piece of glass, glare is kept to a minimum thanks to the true black filters on this set.5. 3D image quality. Outstanding. You can adjust the 'depth' in and out of the 3D image, which is actually pretty fun to do. My advise is, if viewing 3D in the daytime with ambient light, bump up the brightness. At night, it's fine to leave it on the default modes. This set also included the 3rd Generation Panasonic 3d glasses, so they were very comfortable, had no flicker, and auto shut off.6. Wifi connectivity. It's ok. Stick with your PS3 if you can, regarding Netflix. Via PS3/XBOX/Wii, the Netflix menu is generally snappier, and there are more subcategories than the built in one on the TV. Otherwise, interesting feature. SD card (not included) required if you want to download games and apps to your TV.7. Viewing Angle. Perfect. I'm almost 90 degrees from my TV right now, and I can still see the image. No light leakage coming from the sides (cough, edge lit LED's, cough). All viewers get the same, amazing, natural image.8. Burn in. Not a problem. I've been playing PS3 games, watching letterbox movies, haven't had any issue with it. There are far too many power saving/Screen Saving precautions built into both my PS3 and the TV, that even if I passed out on a paused game screen, the Image would eventually shut off.9. Thin! Very, very thin. LED kind of thin. Solid build quality as well.10. No fluctuating brightness issues. Maybe it was the build I got, but I have yet to see any such problems.CONS:1. Heavy. If you're a body builder, maybe you can heave this up by yourself. Don't try it.2. Soft, hardly noticable, buzzing. You have to be six inches from the TV, with no other sound, to hear it. And, it will only happen when the image auto dims (PS3 feature). It disappears once the image is at full strength.  I would say it sounds most like a soft hard drive whirring.  Again, not noticable unless you usually stick your head to the back of the TV, and rarely occurs.  I believe this is an inherent design of Plasmas.Well that's it. It's the last TV you will need, trust me.UPDATE 9JAN2012: My TV was produced in \"May2011\", and has not shown any fluctuating brightness issues at all.

I picked it up after my Pioneer Kuro was stolen. You can read my Kuro review to see what I thought about that television.Every review I could find said this was THE television to have going forward. Panasonic was supposed to pick up the flag after Pioneer exited the television business, especially in the plasma market. Well, it is NOT as good as the Kuro, but it's definitely great - or so I thought.I have always been into the picture. Black level, contrast, refresh rate, all that stuff that people like US are into (because if you're looking at this television then we are indeed similar)... I never really bothered much with the quality of the hardware. While I was particular about the companies I bought from, I never thought about warranty service or longevity of the product. Why not? Well, these are high end, top shelf products from the \"best\" suppliers. I never expected to have problems. In fact, my Pioneer Kuro never ever had a single problem. And my 50\" rear projection Hitachi never gave me a problem. I bought that TV in 1997 and finally sold it in 2011. I shipped that TV all over the world. It survived overseas transport, storage, and differing voltages through poorly regulated transformers... I had an extended warranty plan on the Hitachi (via Circuit City) but I never once used it. And of course, I didn't use the Pioneer Kuro warranty (for about 5 years). So when I had a chance to buy the extended warranty for my Viera, I declined. As a side note, I was paranoid about buying anything extended from Best Buy, since for the past few years it was uncertain if they were financially solvent enough to stay in business. Plus, I thought, \"TV's don't break, especially ones with a mature technology like plasma screens.\"So, I buy the Viera. It's a very nice looking TV and I very much enjoyed it. Again, not as good as the Kuro but very excellent. After about 1.5 years I could tell that the black bars on the top and bottom of a typical widescreen movie were getting lighter. I've never calibrated it. I didn't use the speakers much since I've hooked into an external surround sound, but they did sound pretty good when I used them. However, buyer beware - there are many complaints about Panasonic plasma televisions concerning build quality and longevity. Anyone reading this review is in the market to spend $2000-$4000 (or more) for a high end electronic product. Imagine your disappointment when the prized centerpiece of your showroom suddenly stops working. And then that's it.I travel a lot for work and I don't watch TV all the time when I'm home. So, whether or not I was actually watching television, I was physically in the house with the device for something between 6 months to 1 year's worth of time when it failed, which was 25 months after I bought it. At the 23 month mark, it gave me some problems (I think 13 flashing lights), but the problem went away. I thought it was a glitch, but in retrospect it was a warning. Then, at 25 months, I got 7 flashing lights and a blank screen. The point of all the explanation was that the amount of time I actually used the television was very low, and it already has failed. Panasonic tech support was not very helpful and the website was not useful. Since my warranty expired, I would have had to pay $9.99 just to talk to somebody, who couldn't have helped me beyond referring me to an authorized dealer anyway. In fact, that's what happened. They recommended I call an authorized repair shop and gave me some numbers. I called (and paid the $150 service fee) for some folks (Geek Squad) to come look at it. Now, these televisions fail so often that tech support guys already had an idea of what was wrong with the TV, so they ordered the part in advance. It turns out that they needed the part they ordered, plus two other parts. They told me that 3 boards in my TV had to be replaced to the tune of $784.That's right. $784 dollars, plus the service fee, nearly 30% of the original cost. And the parts only carry a 3 month warranty. Another repair service told me the same thing, so I guess that's standard. (Where else can you find parts that costs hundreds of dollars, to fix a multi-thousand dollar machine, and only have with a 3 month warranty?) No one could tell me what caused my problem, just speculation, ranging from faulty boards or a surge. Pure speculation, nobody knows. Well, I have a pretty awesome surge protector. And nothing else is damaged or shows signs of a surge. And independent research online yields many, many people that have my exact same problem. When Microsoft experienced these catastrophic failures on the Xbox360 machines, they honored the warranty with a brand new replacement (even after it expired) and re-engineered the machine to eliminate the \"red circle of death\" from remaining a problem on future consoles. Apple charges a premium for their products, but they rarely break. And when they do, the warranty service, tech support and customer service are first rate. As a consumer, it seems that Amazon has amazing everything. Panasonic has not behaved the same way. Their \"7 blinking lights of death\" problems remain. Some people have failures immediately, others in a year or two, and these problems have been around for several years. It's widespread and pervasive enough that there should be a corporate response. But, there is not. And now, Panasonic is shifting away from Plasma technology entirely.*********As a support for my argument, this is what you'll see on Panasonic's website under their FAQ for product support:What does it mean when the TV's red indicator light continuously blinks?Panasonic utilizes the blinking light as a form of self-diagnostics, similar to the \"check engine\" light in your car.

Panasonic uses the number of times the light blinks, to aid the technician in trouble-shooting the problem. The blinking light indicates an area of concern and helps the technician to isolate the problem and order the correct parts. This in turn speeds up the repair process, keeps parts cost down, and helps both you and the servicer by allowing the technician to complete a repair in one trip in most cases. Some Internet blogs claim the blinks are an indication of major quality problems; however, that's not the case. In fact, a recent leading consumer magazine rated Panasonic the most reliable of 18 major manufacturers of both plasma and LCD models.*********Why does Panasonic feel it necessary to even address and worse, attempt to discredit the \"internet blogs\" that complain of these malfunctions? And what recent consumer magazine? And what is the proof? And why is this still a problem? Why is Panasonic content to release TVs that have inherent and known flaws? Could it have something to do with their abandonment of Plasma technology? Why haven't they changed things or offered help to people that made major investments into their brand, but  don't have a working device? Can you trust this company? That's the question. If you buy this set, a used plasma model or a brand new new ZT series, can you trust the long term quality of the product and will the company back that product? You're taking a big chance if you do. like so many other owners.I have a worthless, brand new, shiny $3000 television sitting on the TV stand. And it will remain that way until I fork over yet again a third of the price to repair it, not knowing if or for how long the repair will last, but fully aware that I only get a 3 month warranty on $784 dollars worth of parts. This was the flagship product when I bought it. Now I'd be lucky to be able to sell it for next to nothing. It just doesn't seem right.*********So, that's my review and what I think of Panasonic plasma's in particular and Panasonic overall.

The Samsung was nice, but I did not care for the drop out in dark to black scenes in the picture quality when watching movies. It may have something to do with the 120mhz refresh rate. Besides, as my better half pointed out, everyone has a 55\" now. Well, you don't have to tell me twice that we need a larger HDTV, so I began my search for a larger set. At the time, there was only one other HDTV I was interested in beside this one, and it was the 70\" Sharp HDTV. I needed to see both sets, and as luck would have it, Sears not only had them both, but they were displayed side by side. Grant it, the Sharp had 5\"s over Panasonic, but it did not even come close with picture quality. Example; green grass on the Panasonic HDTV looked like beautiful natural green grass. With the same display on the Sharp LED HDTV, the grass was more of a lime green and looked like a cartoon version of the picture. Very bright and not realistic. It made my choice simple and easy. I'll take quality over the 5\"s any time. Not to mention, Panasonic was 3D and Sharp was not. And with a 600mhz refesh rate, you rarely see any drop out in dark to black scenes. I know that the Sharp LED is easier on the electric bill, but it comes down to this, do you want to watch a high quality picture that can be compared with a theater (or better)? Or, do you want to save a few bucks and watch cartoons?Would I buy this product again? I'm already looking forward to upgrading with the new P65ZT60. Of course I have to first CONvince my better half as to how badly we need such a set when this one is an excellent choice as it is.Now, before I finish, the only warning I have for anyone is, if you are looking for a 3D HDTV, know this: You must have a 3D Blu Ray, and if you have a home surround system, you must have a receiver that has a 3D pass through filter. Also, depending how much you watch 3D, or how many family members are in your home, you may need to purchase extra 3D (Active) glasses (and they are not cheap). Check it all out first. I found out one step at a time and it was expensive. You may save money if you buy a package deal. 3D HDTV and a Blu Ray player with a surround sound system.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture", "Author": "reo4ua", "ReviewID": "R3B2G5DND2J089", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 5/27/14....5 hours of use per day - evening network series and afternoon xbox gaming.

I've read about major problems with this TV so I was concerned enough to ponder the possibility of a return.  I'm glad I did.I got the TV delivered within the promised timeframe and the delivery persons were polite and setup the TV where I wanted it.  I turned it on while they were there and everything looked good.  I left the TV on for the next 15 minutes and then a 3 inch wide verticle black line appeared in the middle of the screen!  I read about this from another reviewer this year, so I called Panasonic right away and they asked me to unplug and replug the TV.  None of the suggestions the phone rep gave me worked so they scheduled a 3rd party local repair shop for a visit the following week.  At this time, I thought, wait a minute I just spent $2500 on the TV and it already needs major service from a third party?  I also recalled that the other reviewer with the same problem was without his TV for 30 days and counting.  I cancelled the service call and called Amazon for a replacement instead.  I was duly impressed!  A live person answered the phone with no delays, and set everything up for me to pickup the broken one and deliver a new one within a week's time.  Very nice.The new TV arrived as promised and the broken one was taken away.  I got the refund credit in about two weeks.So onwards to the TV review of the second set...WOW!  To begin, I ran the TV continuously for about 8 hours using Saving Private Ryan.  I was disappointed at first because the definition was not as sharp as I liked and it was really scary to see how the TV reacted to bright flashes such as flames by having bright lines/halo around the flames.  After the initial breakin, the halo settled.  Gaming on PS3 is spectacular with 3D games just coming alive.  I hooked up a hard drive with photographs to the TV's USB port, but the menu that followed did not display all of the photographs and the TV's interface with the photo files was hard to navigate.  So I hooked up the drive to the PS3 instead and I was wowed by the beautiful pictures.  When you look at pics on a 65\" HDTV, be prepared to see things and people in the background of photographs you have never seen before!Nice TV, very happy with it.

While the Item was received in original box, there were missing items (1 pair of 3d glasses, optic al cable for TV.) Remember, I did purchased a used version of it (but the description did not mention missing parts). Amazon did a great job of replacing items and gave me a bigger discount on TV.

Loved the TV but after about 6-7 months or so, I started noticed the Fluctuating Brightness problem that's been well documented via reviews and online forums.  I also noticed that image retention was a bit of a problem.  After watching a channel like ESPN, Weather channel, or other news channel with static graphic images for about 30-60 mins, I would continue to see some of those images for a period of time after changing the channel.  I attributed this to the fact that it was just a plasma.  The image would go back to normal after a while or by performing the screen swipe process available in the menu.  It was also a problem with pillar or letterboxed content.  However, fluctuating brightness was completely unacceptable to me.  It's one of those things that after you notice it, it becomes very irritating and you see it all the time.  Watching a movie like \"Inception\" was definitely a problem for me.After making sure it wasn't my blu-ray player, HDMI Cables, HT receiver, or my D*tv box, I called Panasonic and explained the issue.  The process wasn't the easiest or fastest but it got done and after a month and a half or so, my VT25 was replaced with this VT30.  I thought the VT25 was incredible in terms of image quality, black performance, 3D picture, etc, and figured the VT30 would just be a slight improvement... It's been way more than expected.In terms of black levels, the VT30 is much improved over the VT25, which is saying a lot considering that just a year prior, the VT25 was considered \"King\" in black level performance (not taking into consideration the Kuro of course, only TV's that were currently in production).  Overall brightness hasn't changed much but I think the VT30 is a slight bit brighter which helps in bright rooms but still not like LCD displays which can be way too bright anyway.  Plasma's display much more realistic brightness and contrast overall in comparison to LCD's which overdo it.  Color also seems improved and the THX mode is awesome.  I haven't had it professionally calibrated but the THX mode is more than adequate for now.Image retention?  Can't see any of it.  It's been such a huge difference that I wonder if my old VT25 had this additional defect or if it was just a major improvement by Panasonic on the VT30.This TV also has a couple new features in comparison to the VT25 including some new display adjustment options (though nothing significant).  The biggest in my opinion being \"Motion Smoother\" which does a similar (though not as intense) effect as 120 and 240hz lcd's giving 24fps content that soap opera look.  In my geeky opinion, this shouldn't even be allowed because it changes the way a movie is meant to look but some people prefer this.  THX mode, however, doesn't allow for this option to be used, which I think is a great thing.  Only good use for it is maybe during sporting events.The TV also added a 2D to 3D conversion feature but it's not very consistent.  For someone like me, it's kinda cool to check out sometimes and see how the TV interprets different scenes, but in reality it's kind of useless.I don't normally care for the physical appearance of a TV.  To me, the image quality is what's important, not the box that surrounds it.  However, I have to say this is a much nicer looking TV than the VT25.  It feels like it leaped several years into the future from one model to the next, especially in overall thickness of the display.  This one is incredibly thin.  I have no idea how they pull this off.  Top of the line Samsungs, however, are still even slimmer than this, which is mind boggling.One of the negatives of this TV, is the continuing lack of proper color gradation.  It's definitely much improved over the VT25, but still noticeable.And actually, that may be the only negative thus far for me.  Some people criticize the audio from flat screens across the board but we can't expect much.  These displays are so thin that they just do not allow enough space for good speakers.  I highly recommend supplementing audio with a home theater system or sound bar.I've had it for about a month and half now and have noticed no problems whatsoever.  It may be too early to tell if FB will be a problem again, but so far, it's perfect.  I have read, however, that certain Panasonic TV's produced after a certain date should be free of this defect.  If you encounter the same issue, go through the warranty process.  It was definitely worth it for me...", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unrealisticly Great Picture Quality!!!", "Author": "C.M. \"Electronic Wiz\"", "ReviewID": "R1IBCO2NDQKJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV was purchased by me a little less than a month ago and I could not be happier.

Then it died during the first year warrantee period.  Seven red blinks of the power light - then nothing.  Since then - a month now - the company has done nothing to repair the TV (the warrantee is for on site repair which they say happens with a few days) claiming first they were shipping parts from Japan to a local repair operation - will take three weeks, then three weeks later the story became that the parts are backordered - no eta.  No one will come out to look at it until all possible parts arrive.  All the while Panasonic continues to ship the same model as new to stores - to be sold for full retail.  I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to talk the Panasonic service team - promises that they will escalate our situation, and that will call back within 24 hours ... nothing done, no call backs ever ... nothing.  Apparently according to Panasonic tech support at the company, there is significant repair demand  for these parts for this TV, the P55VT30.  They as much as admit that they have a repair problem with this model.  We're now looking at the repair contract and if the TV is not repaired within 60 days because of back-ordered parts, it states that \"the company\" will determine if a replacement reimbursement should be made ... if that happens we get purchase price - without sales tax - and i would guess they won't reimburse us for the extended warrantee we purchased from their affiliate (by the way if you buy the TV plan on adding in the cost of the warrantee despite the fact that if you need it you might face a world of frustration).

If it had a better mirrored surface I could at least use it as a wall mirror, but no its not even useful for that.Anyhow, Panasonic's phone support was wonderful and explained that the 7 flashes meant I should call a repair person, and oh sorry we only warranty the TV for 1 year...  From reading online it seems this is quite a common problem with Panasonic's Plasma TV's.  Wish I had known this before buying it...  So I am facing an unknown, likely expensive bill, which will likely place a new power supply which will fail in a similar time frame and manner as the current one did so I can repeat the process.  Either that or get a new set, and pay to have this one hauled away...  Both choices stink and as a consumer, I have to say I don't like being faced with the choice of being tossed out the window or down the stairs...  But few manufacturers will own their design flaws or mistakes these days...So yep, caveat emptor and the smart money is spent on some other product...", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Died in 18 months, no replacement boards available.", "Author": "AMLENTZ", "ReviewID": "R161F3PYELS8HX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the VT30 after a year of research. Six months after the manufacturers warranty expired it died. I had purchased the extended warranty, so after a house call the repair tech said a new Y-board would arrive in two days. Then I was told the board was back ordered one week. Then I was told Panasonic no longer makes replacement parts for this model, and my only option was to pick another tv with similar specs from a short list of their choosing. Really Panasonic, NO replacement parts for a $2000 tv that is only 18 months old?! The Panasonic TC-P60GT50 was offered, but I've read that it suffers from horrific image burn issues, for which Panasonic categorically blames the user. I won't mention the BBrick and mortar store I purchased it from, but they apparently have no firm policies in regards to this situation, and replacement issues vary greatly depending on who you contact at the store. It seems you need to hitch your cart to the best store supervisor you can find who feels your pain.Follow up 5/1/13: I finally found a store supervisor that gave us a VT60 as a replacement, which retails for $600 more than I paid for the VT30 so I'm happy. I bought a five year warranty on the new VT60 because IT'S A PANASONIC. So I should be getting a free VT90 in a year or two when the VT60 dies.

After about 3 months, this TV had developed bad motion shudder, screen uniformity, and burn-in problems. It was replaced with a 2012 model VT50 that had a faded weird band on the right side. About 3 months later the band got worse (pretty bad) and there were other screen uniformity issues (yes - I ran break in slides). The Panasonic tech basically admitted the VT30 and VT50 had known problems with degrading panel after use (black level fading, getting red, inconstant lighting etc) and the VT50 dark band on the right side was \"normal and passed QA\" on all VT50s. The VT50 had the same band on the right after a panel replacement (just a warning... when someone replaces your panel, they're probably going to get dirt/hair/scratches in between the glass front and the panel). The tech offered to buy back my TV because he admitted the \"right band\" problem and degraded panel performance \"are simply the flaws with [Panasonic] plasma technology.\" If you want plasma, shop Samsung... but they have horror stories too. Tests have shown Samsung doesn't degrade as fast or similar to Panasonic.Original:So I researched and tried out many TVs before settling on this one.To sum it up, every other TV had some kind of annoying issue that my pessimistic and critical eyes caught, not allowing me to live with. Though not perfect, this TV has near-flawless picture quality during movies or games and no weird annoying issue. I was relieved when I didn't see LED imperfections - it simply feels satisfying. The black color is amazing - black scenes literally looks like the TV is turned off.3d isn't perfect, but the best I seen compared to competition and varies with content. It has the same 3D issues like every other TV during this time. It is neat on occasions, but I find I watch 95% 2D and enjoy it more because it is more comfortable and seems like better resolution (in 3D, if feels you are part of the scene and therefore miss out on stuck not in your perspective). Its nice to have the feature just in case more high quality TV content is made in the future, but I don't put much stock into it. If you have a good TV, don't buy a new one just for 3D - you will be disappointed in the availability of quality content.A few gripes:Short-term image retention and constant fear something will \"stick\" (it hasn't so far)Plasma \"flicker\" when looking too close and even noticeable from a distanceslight buzz on bright scenes, but hardly noticeable (Samsung has it worse)Fear that plasma will degrade (recalibrate can fix it and it isn't supposed to, but last year's models did)This TV is worth it, while the high end LEDs are overpriced and underdeveloped. Unless you hate plasma due to the above issues, there really isn't a reason to get LED-LCD.WARNING: The TV is covered with an anti-glare film that is very easy to scratch. Running a damp cloth with particle CAN create tiny scratches. You must scratch really hard to notice from a distance though.3-18-2012: So despite knowing that front of the TV is easily scratched, I now have a small mark in the center of mine after flicking a bug off with my finger one night. I noticed it a few days later and it was hard to believe because I recall the night and I barely touched the TV. The mark is not visible at all when the TV is on, but is apparent when off. Regardless, this is another warning about this problem. I wish they didn't put the stupid coating on the front and have false advertising about the \"Gorilla glass\" which is supposed to be hard to scratch.Also, I am not sure if there is related to the actual TV or my PS3 blueray player, but fast motion has a HORRIBLE flicker.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible Plasma", "Author": "Nguyenguy", "ReviewID": "R3FTG74GLTW4HQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for 2 months now. The picture quality on the VT30 is amazing! The combination of style and picture quality made this a clear stand out when doing months of research. The only TV that could match this is the Sharp Elite and that cost twice as much (not worth it IMO)! The color clarity and depth make you feel like you're watching HD for the first time again, it's that good. Watching blu-rays and playing games are incredible and blows away anything I expect to see in a reasonable price range for many years to come. OLED may be the future, but a display won't be under $3k for many years, though I digress. I could not be happier with the VT30!Though the picture quality is great with factory setting, you'll be really blown away when you get it properly calibrated. I highly recommend owners check out the company SpectraCal and their calibration software CalMAN. They have an exclusive partnership with Panasonic where you can do a full auto-calibration of the VT30 greyscale with one push of a button. I bought their CalMAN consumer panasonic package and love how fast and simple it is. A worthwhile investment that I can use to calibrate my VT30 and other TVs as many times as I need!

If you check out the other 1 star reviews for this TV, or google the \"7 blinking lights Panasonic\", you'll see that Panasonic has a quality issue with their VT30 tvs, possibly even their plasmas made in the past several years.  Mine died after first starting a loud buzzing sound that would get louder the more white was on the screen.  Then it developed a purple ghosting image on the top half of the screen that looked like image retention (you could see the tv guide bars) and was most noticable the more white was on the screen.  Using the \"white scrolling bar\" option for about 15 minutes would help remove some of the ghosting image.  Then after about 2 weeks of this issue happening, the TV just turned off suddenly and we couldn't turn it back on.Luckily, I had purchased a 4 year extended warranty from BB and they just came out to diagnose the TV.  They said the buzzing noise was caused by loose screws that developed over time and there was a repair kit to replace the screws (they merely added washers to the screws!).  However, tv not turning back on was due to the SC board going bad and would need to be replaced.  One was to be ordered and would be shipped to my place.  There seems to be a theory out there that the loose screws issue actually causes some of the boards to short out.  However, I am not a technically inclined person so I can only repeat what others have been saying online.  The folks from BB wouldn't confirm that the two issues (buzzing and tv dying) were interrelated.I'll update this review once BB has fixed the TV and whether replacing the screws and the SC board solved everything.Some people noted that when their TVs died in 2013, there weren't any replacement boards available.  So it's either Panasonic made some more in the interim, or there are a bunch of refurbished boards floating around...Anyways, I suggest staying away from Panasonic Plasmas, even if the price is very desirable.

Also - this is a BIG, HEAVY TV. We had a service install it and it takes a special (an rather expensive) bracket to mount (went with Sanus).Setting it up was a breeze.

As a result last year's Panasonic Flagship model is no longer 4k, but $2500.  This particular set comes with 3D glasses and wireless abilities including stuff like Amazon and Netflix streaming.

What I really like about Panasonic is their THX mode.  While it isn't perfect in terms of settings/paramters, it is darn close and eliminates the need to have the TV professionally calibrated.  Back in 2009 Panasonic had a real mess on their hands, their Plasma HDTVs lost their deep blacks over time.  Over the last year CNET continued to measure the black levels on this particular set and black levels actually got better with time.  So the black level issue has been taken care of.[...]I have played 360, ps3 and Wii on this set.  Everything works and looks brilliant.  Movies also look spectacular.  The only complaint is the weight of this set, about 140 lbs.  So it does require a nice stand.  The weight isn't a big issue given I don't move it around routinely, but getting it out of the box isn't easy and does require a few hands.  The one nice thing about the weight is the glass.  More and more companies are taking out the glass screen and replacing it with plastic.  Call me crazy but I think the glass really makes the picture much stronger, not too mention glass is more durable.  Plasma HDTVs have a burn-in myth surrounding them.  While burn-in is possible, it is tough to accomplish.  I played over 1000 hours of games on my 2008 Pansonic plasma and have had zero issue with burn-in.  So far I have played over 50 hours on this particular set, no issues with burn-in at all.  Skyrim is amazing on 65 inches of HD.

We watch everything through a PC connected via HDMI.  Did it on our old 720p Samsung DLP, did it on our Sony 1080p DLP, did it on a Samsung plasma that ended up being returned for dead pixels. Tried it on this baby.  A few hours after first turning it on, it powered down seemingly at random.  I went through and shut off every option I could find on both my PC and on the TV that related to sleep, hibernation, screen saver, or eco-anything.  Still got shut-downs.  Called Panasonic support who suggested I try a different HDMI cable.  Okay, I swapped cables, It ran long enough for me to turn it off of my own volition at the end of the evening.  Today the shut downs started again. I poked and prodded some more, but nothing worked.  Called Panasonic again.  This time, after research, I was told that PC input via direct HDMI connection is not supported on this TV, and there is only a 50/50 chance it will work at all.  This $2800 TV has 4 HDMI ports for you to plug in a blueray, a cable box and 2 other devices, but apparently not a computer. Using the PC is about convenience - 3D Blueray, streaming video, games, and internet all on one box.  No reliable PC connection via HDMI is a deal breaker.

However, the broadcast programs from antenna looks not as good as on the earlier Samsung.However, the most frustrated problem with this TV is the Wifi adapter! After trying to set it up with my Wifi router, the TV though can detect the signals, was not able to connect to the Internet.In fact, it can connect it only for a couple of times. But after I turn off the TV and turn on the TV, the Wifi adapter can not re-establish the internet connection.After a couple of days, I called Panasonic tech support. They asked me to walk through the same set-up process and the TV would still not connect to the internet wirelessly.The Panasonic tech rep told me to get an Ethernet cable to hook up directly with my Internet modem. They said that if the TV would work through the direct link, then their Wifi adapter would be defective.I bought the Ethernet cable, hooked up, and the TV works seemlessly with the Internet.Call Panasonic Tech support again, described what happend, and the new tech guy said that there is nothing wrong with their Wifi adapter, but it is our modem box that is the culprit!!!I told them that we have 5 smart phones, 4 laptops, and 1 desktop of various brands, makes, and models and they all connect to the Wifi router just fine.Anyway, they won't burge and said that they would have to do more reseach on the adapters and will call back in 24-48 hours.They never do!I called Panasonic again today, saying that I need a replacement Wifi adapter right now, even through they tried to have me jump through their hoop again. I said I had enough of that, and I would not do another test again, because I already did all they asked, including having a direct Ethernet cable connected.I told them that I need a Wifi adapter replacement today and no more gimmick. They told me to send in the Wifi adapter back before they would send a replacement.I asked them how long it would take to send out the new Wifi adapter and was told it would take them 7 to 10 business days to send it out.I told them that would be unacceptable to me, because it would take 5 days for the returned defective Wifi adapter to reach them, then another 2 weeks from them to send the replacement back for a total of three weeks.I told them that why don't you just sell me the damn thing, I will pay for it, ship it to me right now, and give me the refund when I return the defective Wifi adapter.But they said that they do not sell this Wifi adapter, period! And it is true! I went to Panasonic website, and they have only that wifi WL10 for the VT25, GT30, etc... only.I told the tech guy that why such a simple and inexpensive piece of accessories would cause so much problem for the Panasonic customers. Why can't they be flexible about these little simple problems.They said that it is their policy and there is nothing they can do about it. Which means you can not purchase the replacements for defective one, and it would probably take 3-4 weeks to get a replacement. Talk about good customer service!I called Amazon.com, seeing if they could leverage their weight on Panasonic and get the part sooner for me. Amazon rep. was extremely helpful: he called Panasonic but unfortunately the result was the same thing: 3-4 weeks return. The Amazon rep. offered the $50 discount for the defective Wifi adapter so I can buy a different one on Amazon, but as I said, there is no substituting Panasonic adapter that would fit these VT30 TVs.As the last resort, I went to Panasonic website and chatted with their online rep. and everything went pretty much the same as described above. No expediting process, no short-cut thru the red-tape procedures.The rep even had the ball to ask me to run the wire while waiting for the replacement. I told him that \"Are you willing to poke two holes through your attic and run the wire, or are you willing to let your wire run hanging around your house like a getto?\"It is such a frustrated experience for otherwise a good TV. The question now is that should I return this Panasonic TV for good or get another Samsung?  But I already returned the Samsung, and I would hate to return another, not mentioning that I have to return 6 pairs of 3D glasses as well.Or shall I bite the bullet and send in the defective Wifi adapter for exchange? What happened if the new Wifi Adpater does not work? I have seen a lot of complaints regarding Panasonic Wifi adapters would not hook up with wifi routers.What are your suggestions, guys!Latest update: I upgraded this TV from a \"***\" to \"****\" due to the quick and easy fix on the wifi adapter issue.

It had a July build, had the fluctuating bright problem, and had scratches all over the screen. The wifi also did not work with the dongle...Fortunately, my replacement was an October build and did not have any of these issues...Picture - deep blacks, natural-looking colors. To me it did have a bit of a dim picture, but this is inherit with all plasmas. I have always been an LCD owner so it took me time to adjust to the dimmer picture. I was used to the bright, overexagerated colors of an LCD. Some LCD owners may not like the difference, but overall, the picture is more natural, details come out better in dark scenes, and the colors are more of how you would see them live. With some adjustments, you can get a brighter picture, but to me it looked like you lost some details. I'm sure when it is properly caliburated, people will find a happy medium.Sound - I have a sound system, so I really didn't test this.Game Mode - Games on this looked great. No detectable input lag. Guitar Hero on Xbox 360 in game mode came back with a O MS Response Rate for video. It was around 12 MS response rate when left in movie mode. MLB and StarDust on the PS3 was amazing looking.3D - The 3d was what I expected. It did the job. I didn't notice any particular issues when in this mode. I do think the glasses need to come down in price. $100 for a pair is ridiculous. And including only 1 pair with this TV is just mind-boggling.Reported Problems with plasmas / this tv: With the October build, I have not seen the fluctuating brightness problem (or green blob problem reported by some).One of my main worries was burn-in. I play a lot of video games and wasn't going to get a plasma because of that reason. I bought through best buy which covers burn-in through their warranty. Without this warranty, I would not have bought a plasma. That is just me. I really don't want to worry about it even though sales people tell you it is not a problem any longer. I fortunately, did not see a hint of burn-in.Overall, I am happy with this TV. I tried the sharp 70 inch (735U), but I couldn't get the picture quality to my satisfaction.Edit - Now that I have had this TV for a while, I do have some additional comments. I completely forgot to mention the buzzing in my original post. You really can't hear the buzzing unless you put your head behind the tv and listen. This isn't an issue. If you hear your TV buzz from 2 feet or more away, then there is something wrong with your tv.The one complaint I have with this TV now and I'm not sure if it is a problem with all large screen tvs (65' or above), is the edge noise. For some reason, most of the content I watch is either not stretching corner to corner or has these vertical distorted lines along each side. I watch all my content in \"Full\" mode. There is a setting to trim the noise (aspect setting) that will take care of this problem, however, you lose 5% of the actual intended display of the content your watching. In other words, it zooms in a little bit. I personally don't like this. I rather see the entire movie as it was intended. I don't know if this is a problem specific to Panasonic. I don't remember seeing this on the 70' Sharp, but it is possible the problem did exist and I just didn't have the TV long enough to notice...", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but beware 3D Caution...", "Author": "NiKoLaI", "ReviewID": "R37PE16ZYPDXKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched for about 3 months while anxiously awaiting tax season to finally upgrade to an HDTV.

The picture is amazing and I couldn't be happier.  There are some bad reviews out there with glare and buzzing.  Neither of which I have witnessed.  There is reflection, but the screen is glass, so what do you expect?  It is also tinted, so what little light peeks through the blinds is very minimal on the screen itself.NOW THE BAD.  The panasonic 3D glasses that come with the TV and the ones that come with the Avatar 3D bundle only work about 14-15 feet away from the TV.  My couch is 17.  So when I turn them on and stand within that distance, they work great.  The second I sit on the couch, the shutters turn off.  When I approach the TV again, they come back on.  This really sucks, because I have 300 bucks of 3D glasses that do not work where I want them to.  The silver lining?  I bought a pair of cheaper PS3 glasses and they work fine, up to 17 feet.

My fiancee purchased the Wal-Mart Black Friday 65\" for $998, and although the picture quality is quite amazing the Toshiba pales in comparison to the build quality of the Panasonic. Although the Panasonic is heavy, I know it's from the high grade aluminium chassis and full glass front panel, nothing rattles, nothing bends like cheap plastic. All the rivets and screws are super tight. The input connections, HDMI, component, USB, all fit perfect and none of them have any room for wiggle. I thought it was really neat that the component/audio ports are simple iPhone audio port size jacks, with converter cables included. The menus are fast with little lag, something that would drive me nuts. So far I've heard no buzzing, humming, or clicking during usage, it's really quiet. I'd comment on the sound too, because the four large speakers in the back look pretty nice, but I immediately turned it off since I've installed surround sound in my man-cave.

Also, the service from CEVA who delivered the TV and also Amazon customer service was excellent.  I only have one big issue with this TV, it just doesn't display a bright enough picture for my taste.  I previously had a Vizio LED TV that went out on me so as I'm sure most of you reading this are doing, I did research on what was the latest and greatest in TV picture quality.  I read Cnet reviews, and many reviews on Amazon and all over the Web.  Everyone seemed to think that the Panasonic VT30 was the best TV currently out there so I went ahead and bought this TV.Cons:I have never had a plasma TV before so maybe that is why I was not impressed with this one.  When viewing any bright colors or white images the screen looked very dim and the picture just doesn't pop out like it does on an LED TV.  Another down side of this TV and most plasmas in general is that this TV puts off a lot of heat and I mean, a lot.  I could tell that my living room would get much warmer when this TV was on.  Also, the Energy Guide's rating that says this TV only uses about $24 is not completely true since this rating is for the standard configuration which is almost unwatchable since it is very very dim.  When properly configured this TV will cost you more around $70-$100 per year in electricity per year, which still isn't much per month but is worth mentioning and since it also gives off so much heat it will also increase your electric bill even more since you will have to run the A/C more often.Pros:Some good things about this TV are that the black levels are excellent and as good as the other reviews said.  Also, the glare was not as much of an issue as I thought it would be since it has a sheet of glass covering the screen.  The glass seems to have some sort of anti glare coating on it which was a nice surprise.  The sound quality actually wasn't bad for regular TV speakers either.Final Verdict:So, I would say if you are used to watching a plasma TV and like watching a more dim screen then maybe this TV is for you.  But, if you are like me and you are already used to watching an LED TV and actually like your colors and whites to be bright then this might not be the TV for you.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dim Picture compaired to same TV in 50 inches", "Author": "Brian N Dickinson", "ReviewID": "R1PAW9QL8ANGKL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got this TV yesterday and was expecting to be wowed. I have the exact same TV in the 50 inch size and have been so happy with it that I decided to upgrade to 65. I have two dish boxes in the house and when I put these TV's side by side on the same HD movie on the same picture mode (THX was the one I played with the most) I found that to match the brightness of the 50 inch set at 55/100 I had to crank the brightness settings on the 65 inch to 90/100. All other settings were the same between the two TVs. Has anyone else experienced this? I know plasmas lose some of their brightness over time so I don't want to start out with the TV already almost at its max levels. I did try switching cables, inputs, sources, etc and nothing changed.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "USELESS 3D TV", "Author": "Gary A Stalter", "ReviewID": "R31W8OAD2SV7QG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just bought this unit a couple of weeks ago instead of the Samsung UN65D8000. Both TVs have relatively equal picture quality, but after reading the reviews, several people had complained that the Samsung 3D glasses only reached about 12' distance. Panasonic doesn't mention anything about maximum distance in their owner's manual - only a minimum distance of 7' 10\" for the 65\" VT30. My seating is about 14' away from the television set and the 3D glasses don't work at that distance. I called Panasonic technical support and after holding for about 25 minutes, finally talked with a technician that told me the glasses only work to about 12' even though it's not stated in the documentation. He said if enough people complain about it, they might do something to fix it. However, I doubt they will do anything since he didn't seem too concerned about the situation. So, if you have a similar setup where you are more than 12' away from the television, your 3D glasses won't work and you should avoid this set. I am totally upset with Panasonic's documentation and support.  I purchased this television to watch 3D movies and it will not work for me. Thanks for the junk Panasonic. Maybe next time you develop a technology like this, you might take into consideration that people might be sitting more than 12' away from the screen.

This is basically a screen discoloration that can make bright content look greenish. Think of it as a green uniformity issue. Panasonic seems to claim that it is within spec, and so far there is no fix (although rumors of one persist). The severity of the problem can be mild or very very bad.
