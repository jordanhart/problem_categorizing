It was the only one that didn't have a box with damage.  Paid $450 plus taxes.  I spent a good hour or two fiddling with all the TVs in the same shelf that were from 19\" to 26\" HD sets.  There were 26\" of unknown brand that were the same price, slightly more or less, but all had either terrible sound or video, and the majority were of a lesser resolution than this TV.It does have slight leakage from the backlights but only videophiles like myself will notice, and honestly its hardly noticeable.I really like the automatic picture sizing feature, it does a great job resizing the screen with different video sources automatically and stretching them in ways that don't make the picture look bad or way off-scale.  Some of the time I still resort to setting the mode manually but for the most part I live it alone.The ATSC tuner works really good, switching between channels doesn't take very long compared to other sets.  This thing really shines with true HD channels, even with the lousy cable system I have available to me, I was watching some mindblowing video about the birth of the solar system and it was absolutely amazing.The TV is stylish and looks great.  I used to have a 32\" flat CRT TV which blew up after a voltage spike, and with the difference in picture quality and availability of digital stations I don't miss that big heavy bulky piece of furniture at all.If you're looking for a TV thats great to watch and doesn't dominate your living area, or a TV for a bedroom/kitchen, this is a great choice.", "Date": "December 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "FIXED this piece of junk", "Author": "Not an electrician.....", "ReviewID": "R3L025Z104Q80J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For those of you that have problems with this turning itself off and screaching a dozen times during warm up, here's the fix:Take the back panel off, remove heat panel around the motherboard and the cable attached to it.

They look like little black & gold beer cans, and you'll see how the top is domed, and/or the bottom is blown out.

Video: The Video is excellent, Although with a 8ms you can see a slight blur while gaming. I noticed this while playing on a low def PS2 game. The only other complaint is the slight white hue around the screen. It's a bit distracting but nothing too serious.  Audio: The speakers with the set are generally good, for the size they're a bit above average. I hooked up some external speakers and that problem was easily solved.Design: The TV looks great, hands down. But i did have some trouble with the Connection Ports facing downward, it can be a hassle to plug in your DVD player for the first time.

But this one impressed me. The 1080p with HDMI was a pleasant surprise since the in-store display didn't mention it.  Blu-ray movies look amazing on this set.  I couldn't be happier with it.  My only complaint is that even at maximum volume, it doesn't seem that loud.  This may not be a problem for you, as I enjoy my TV at a higher level of volume. Apart from this issue, the sound is very nice on this set. It does have a headphone jack for private listening, which is a nice extra. The simulated surround sound is quite good as well.  I bought two of these and both are working quite well without issue. It's very easy to set up and navigate menu's as well.  A very well made product overall. You cannot go wrong with this set.

I reviewed many newspaper ads featuring lesser priced models; then thought I'd check on-line for price comparison.  It was there that I got caught up into the product reviews, and glad I did. This model was the highest rated of any 19\" LCD with a little higher retail price as well. The Amazon.com price was over $40 less than our BestBuy store including shipping. (BestBuy indicated they were sold-out on-line). The Amazon delivery was on-time, set-up was incredibly simple (even for a non-techie), and the picture/sound is fantastic.

The first unit I brought home had a menu glitch where it would go haywire and even block out access to the action of the physical buttons along the top of the TV.  This may have been due to a software glitch, or in retrospect, it might have been due to me laying the TV down along the control panel surface to install the cabling (which awkwardly direct downward).  This problem also took a few days to pop up and may have coincided with me programming my DirecTV remote to control the TV.  I'm still not sure.  In any event, there was no way to address this myself (resetting the unit and calling Philips did not result in a solution), so I returned it.  The replacement has given me no issues.As of now I'm not running an HD signal into the unit, but it does a nice job with the standard DirecTV signal.  My impression from the HD signal in Walmart was that this TV looked exceptional, and I have a very discerning eye for artifacts, hues, etc.  In fact, it looked as good as many of the better HDTV sets in larger sizes.Overall the unit looks great.  It has a nice glossy black border reminiscent of Samsung models and has a sturdy glass base that is very sharp.I have noticed the slight \"haze\" or backlight leakage that a few have noted, but to me it's not a deal breaker or really all that noticable.  I do notice it because I notice most defects in even the best HDTVs, but it's hardly worth knocking the set down significantly, and most won't even notice.The sound is about what you'd expect from a small TV. It's serviceable, but not great.  I presume that most people don't buy a TV to have wonderful internal speakers, so I don't think this is all that noteworthy.  If you want superior, rich sound, simply buy a set of amplified speakers.  Since this sits in my kitchen, I think the speakers are more than sufficient.As to input connectivity, there is basically one of everything:  HDMI, component, S-video, VGA, and composite.  Yes, it could be better, but I can't imagine this is anyone's primary set running numerous HD inputs, so I found it to be sufficient for running an HD satellite signal.I think many reviews have too high of expectations, so in this case I look at the set in terms of value and function.  For a smaller set that will function as a gaming/bedroom/kitchen unit, it's ideal.  Sure it has minor faults, but I don't believe there is an HD option at 19\" that doesn't.", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Phillips 19\" LCD HDTV", "Author": "croc dundee \"mac man\"", "ReviewID": "R2VIEHCSGBGM1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice small 720p tv for bedroom in small cabinet.

Apparently soon after warranty for many people the TV died. This problem is caused by a faulty part in the TV's motherboard that causes it to fry it completely. The average repair cost i saw online was $200+ which doesn't include labor. So for the first time in my entire life i had to throw away a TV.If you google this model you will find similar storys and you will wonder why wasn't this model recalled.

I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM!THE PROBLEM: Several of capacitors on the mainboard are too low voltage and they fail causing the problem described above.THE SOLUTION (This is not difficult and you don't have to even know what a capacitor is to get the problem fixed)1. Take the back cover off the TV2. Remove the metal enclosure that covers the mainboard3. Unplug all of the connectors that are hooked to the mainboard4. Remove the mainboard5. Find an electronic repair shop in your area and tell them you have several capacitors that need replaced (cost me $40.00)6. The shop that I used tested all of the capacitors and replaced the defective ones with higher voltage capacitors7. If the shop uses higher voltage capacitors they may stick up a littler higher and you may have to cut holes in the metal enclosure to accommodate them (very easy to do, just be careful not to cut yourself)8.

It is gets really annoying seeing the white haze light.The only pro to this tv for me was that it outputs to 1080p for the PS3 like one of the reviewers stated above.  However, it doesn't help when you are playing a game and notice that stupid backlight.  Terrible, just terrible!
