{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Unique TV", "Author": "Jacklyn Widder \"DarlingClementine\"", "ReviewID": "R1QCN5WTJMZVC9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tv is really unique! It looks like a score board & even has a digital clock in the lower corner to make it look like a score. It would be great for a basketball fan, or even just someone who wants a contemporary looking tv. I am not a huge sports fan & I simply bought it because of the contemporary look. My fiance on the other hand loves it for the basketball look.The tv is a 23 in & is framed in glass. It is a perfect size for a small room or bedroom. The digital clock can be turned on & off, and when turned off you can barely even tell that it is a basketball tv. The NBA logo is also very small. The speakers are awesome & the sound is great! The picture is okay, not great, but not bad. You might get a little better picture in HD. We havnt watched anything in HD on it so Im not sure.Overall, I think this tv would be great for a sports fan, or just for a small room tv with a contemporary look. I love it because you get the best of both worlds from it & it works perfect for me & my fiance for different reasons :)", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,399.99", "Features": "23 inch Widescreen LCD Television\n1280 x 768 Pixels Resolution, with 3-D Y/C Digital comb filter\n500 cd/m2 Brightness, 500:1 Contrast Ratio\nMatching Designer Remote Control\nComponent, S-Video, Composite and DVI w/HDCP Video Inputs.
