The picture is great, and the sound is good.  The Amazon site said it had three HDMI ports at the time I ordered, but the TV in reality only has one HDMI (I sent Amazon a note to correct the product description.)  I wasn't thrilled about not getting three HDMI ports, but I decided to keep the TV nonetheless since it has a great picture in the size I need and at a good price.", "Date": "May 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "unbelievable", "Author": "Wolfie \"Diesel Hound\"", "ReviewID": "R3FI8NRJQKKOH1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received my Samsung LNB460 22inch LCD from AmazonWhat a beauty,even with the set off.I've beena Sony person for 20 years,but this baby is impressive.The picture is fantastic and so is the sound,perfect fora bedroom or den.I read the start up manuel 3 times to be surebut to my delight the set does everything for you.All you do isanswer the promps by cliking Enter and you'r done.I'm glad I picked SAMSUNG for a change.Yes,the hardest workingpeople on earth sure put out great stuff lately.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great picture, abysmal sound", "Author": "A. Helfer", "ReviewID": "R2MWKYXP26O66C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "With the recent transition to all digital broadcasts, we decided to upgrade our old 13\" Toshiba instead of buying a converter box.  We settled on this Samsung (LN22B460), a 22\" model.  The tuner on the TV scanned and found most of the digital signals in our area easily enough, even using basic rabbit ears as the antenna.  The menus on the TV are clear and easy to navigate.  The picture is great -- nice rich colors and good contrast -- the best I've seen in an LCD TV of this size.However, the sound is almost totally unacceptable.  It is incredibly nasal and sounds like everyone who speaks is trapped in a big can.  This must owe principally to the fact that the speakers aren't front firing and cannot be too large given the slender cabinet.  Adusting the EQ settings in the Audio menu seems to have little effect on the nasal, dry, recessed quality of the sound.  My laptop computer sounds better.  We'll be keeping the TV but adding some small speakers so it'll sound at least as good as the old $80 Toshiba 13\".Recommended but with reservations about the sound.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN22B460", "Author": "D. Preli", "ReviewID": "RFJ2W1D0LNDL6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased the Samsung LN22B460 and am very pleased with this product.  The previous reviews I read were very accurate.  The picture is very clean and the colors are great, especially in HD.  If not viewing HD channels it is very easy to adjust the colors to get the picture you're looking for.  The set up was very easy.  Just open the box and plug it in.  With not much reading you can figure out how to set up the colors, channel selection, sound, etc.The sound is not terrible like some of the other reviews stated but it could have a little more bottom end to give it a boost.  I'll probably buy speakers to add on as I don't have it set up through a sound system.I've owned several Samsung's over the years and feel that they put out a great product.All in all I would highly recommend this t.v.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "good picture, but....", "Author": "DeDe O", "ReviewID": "R3HDW0TI5MSP72", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We enjoy this tv, it's a perfect size for the bedroom. One problem we've had, however, is adjusting the color to standard from dynamic, which is used in the showroom because of the brighter lighting. The colors are too bright, especially the reds. I switch the picture to standard, but it goes back to the dynamic mode each time I turn the tv off and back on. Talked with a salesman and he suggested unplugging it for awhile and said it should re-set itself...but it didn't make any difference. If we can figure this problem out, will give it 5 stars.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN22B460 LCD HDTV", "Author": "G. A.

I have not found that to be the case.  The sound I am getting on this set is more than acceptable.  Of course, if you're looking for theater-quality surround sound, you need better speakers.  But for a bedroom set, this is just fine.  I also found the set extremely easy to set up, and I have very little technical ability.  The remote control is straight forward and simple to use, even without reading the manual.  I have no hesitation about giving this TV a 5 star rating.", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just the right amount of TV for those who hardly watch", "Author": "M.

Managed to do so just before June 12th. Now that we have this set we actually watch it more often than the old (13\") one. We use a roof-top antenna and finally can watch the local PBS station. All the old stations, with the exception of one, now come in very well. The pictures are very clear. Had to play around with the setup, but I managed quite well and am satisfied.

It worked very well until last week (Dec 2010)when the screen went black when I turned it on. After checking everything I called Samsung customer service who said it needed new firmware (why??) to resolve the issue. So, I went to the website downloaded the firmware and loaded it to the TV through the USB service port. Didn't work...called the service center again and was told the TV would need servicing and since it was out of the 1 year warrenty, all costs would be to my account. I would have expected the TV to last a bit longer...!!! If this is representative of Samsung's quality, I would never purchase another Samsung product ever.  I see they have a newer version of this model..don't waste your money.

Picture quality and features are nice. Volume is inadequate at times even when cranked to the max. The big issue: It's been sent back for warranty repairs twice. The TV shuts off without any warning and won't restart. When this occured the second time within a month, I started researching the internet. There are numerous internet postings on numerous websites concerning defective Samsung LCD TVs, with the same issue. The root cause appears to be capacitors that are inadequate for operation, that overheat and \"blow\" after some months of use. From the comments I've read, literally hundreds of them, other customers experienced the same problem as we did. Depending on the size of the unit, you either return it for warranty service or Samsung arranges for a tech repair on site. They then have the parts replaced with the same inadequate parts as originally were installed and resulting in the same failure. Customers with multi-thousand dollar systems have had to junk their units after a couple years use. I anticipate we will have to do the same, unless I can get an electronic technician to open the unit and replace the capacitors with adequately sized ones. I'll wait unit the unit is out of warranty and fails again.Samsung extended the warranty by 3 months, which is a good thing since we now are returning it for the 3rd time for the same failure.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "SAMSUNG LN22B460 22 Inch 720 dpi LCD HDTV", "Author": "Charles Block", "ReviewID": "R2FYK847I11B1H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great picture.

Seems different manufacturers concentrate on different sizes - Samsung had by far the best picture for the 22\" class (looked at a bunch of TV's at Best Buy to compare).  TV size was dictated by where it's being used.  Great antenna - we have no cable at our rural location and often have a difficult time receiving local stations.  This TV already had 90% of the local stations with only the coaxial cable connected - I hadn't even connected the antenna yet.  With antenna connected it receives all local channels perfectly.The owner's manual is a bible - there are about 1000 features to this TV that we'll never use nor understand.  HDTV feature is stunning when using new Blu-Ray Disc player.  Have only been using for about one month (Christmas present to ourselves)but so far so good.
