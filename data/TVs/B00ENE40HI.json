We contacted the company and after talking to a tech support rep, we instructed to ship it back to them (at our own expense) and they would ship us a new one because our malfunctioning unit was still under their \"great\" 1 year warranty.We shipped it to their location in Mississippi (at a personal cost of $120) We were initially instructed to email the tracking number to the rep we had originally spoken with to speed up the process of them shipping us the new one. We shipped out the originally TV on Nov. 20th.  We never received any confirmation that they had received the number or later the product until we called 2 weeks later. After being on hold for 30+min on several occasions (most times we were sent to voice-mail) we were told everything was in line to ship and to expect our new TV within 7-14 business days. After two more weeks, we called back. still no TV. we were told that they no longer made our model and we would have to wait until a refurbished model was available. Already having waited a month for this replacement, we refused to accept this and finally got a supervisor to approve an upgrade to the next size up. We have since been waiting for the replacement, approaching two months now. Every time we have called, we are told its waiting to be shipped or they are backed up and it will take up to 5 weeks to ship or their warehouse is out of stock. Every time a new story. We are out several hundred dollars between the initial purchase of this TV along with shipping it back. I would NEVER recommend anyone purchase anything from Seiki, they are incompetence and disregard for their customers incarnate.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Broken after 40 days", "Author": "CRD", "ReviewID": "RP3A4HWZYHWNI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Power supply board began sparking and burning 40 days after ownership, and after only being used a handful of times.

They are sleek and beautiful on the wall, but have some quality issues, and most of all, they're expensive!  For my office and for my sister's house, I didn't want to spend as much, where picture quality and design wasn't as important.  It was a pleasant surprise that the two Seiki TVs I bought at really, really, really low prices, had excellent picture quality, even if the frame feels chunky and cheap.  It doesn't even actually look too cheap, but it feels it, and if you're looking from the side, you can see the bottom is quite thick.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Didn't Work Out for Me...", "Author": "Book Lover", "ReviewID": "R3PIR8C05GAJH8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV on January 28th, after reading the reviews, most of which were favorable. I was just looking for an inexpensive TV for my bedroom so I did not care that the one bad review said it was light weight and cheap. The price was good ($47 less than it is listed for now!) and I figured as long as it lasted a few years that is all I cared about. After all, I was only going to be watching it for about an hour per night while I was in bed. However, on February 12th, I went to turn it on and 1/2 of the screen was black. Within a half hour, the entire screen was black. Since I had it less than 30 days returning it wasn't a problem and I consider myself lucky to have dodged a bullet.If the TV had not broken, it would have been fine. The picture was good and it suited my needs.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buy it now", "Author": "James R.

The boxes were not damaged when they arrived but since they were shipped over the road that could be suspect.  Called to get a replacement  but only (1) refurbished was available little disappointed about that  but the Amazon associate responded without me asking and offered a full credit since the items were both new. I really hate to return anything but that was pretty painless because we have UPS and FedEx delivery daily at our office.  Just wish they had a replacement I like the 32 because it can be shipped back and forth for repair and does not require an onsite visit like larger TV\u2019s.  When you have a vacation home the ability to freight it back makes it very easy to manage.  My 2 star rating was based on this (1) worked out of the box (2) stars \u2013 (1) did not (-2) stars and no available replacement (-1) star\u2026did not ask about Amazon but great experience.
