{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Waste of money", "Author": "Luann Jurski", "ReviewID": "R21X2AOMTB4199", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Was shopping for a small TV for the kitchen & since it's made in USA & also recommended by the salesman, I bought it. I am now looking for another one & this will go in my yard sale.  The picture is always distorted, no matter the mode.  The tops of heads are cut off & any print at the bottom of the screen, is also partially cut off. The sound is a bit \"grainy\".  On some stations, the picture is so dark that I virtually can't watch it. Adjusting brightness, etc. does nothing to help. This is very poor in every aspect & a great disappointment for a Made in USA TV. A complete waste of money.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "New - Retail\n1-Year Limited Warranty\nHaier LE22C2380\nHaier Le22c2380 22In Led Hdtv 60Hz 1080P", "Name": "Haier LE22C2380 22\" 1080p 60 Hz LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LOC9zg4AL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0088L6FQG"}}
