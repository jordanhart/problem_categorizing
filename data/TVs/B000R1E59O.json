{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Purchased this baby on July 13, 2007 and...", "Author": "DBroncos 4 Life", "ReviewID": "R2M3U81N68R64A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my initial review of this television after owning it for about three days.What I love:Watching Blu-Ray in 1080P is just spectacular! I own a PS3 and have a 1.3a HDMI cable for connection and the picture is superb. I watched \"The Prestige\" and \"Casino Royale\" in 1080P and was blown away. No pixelation or judder during fast-moving action scenes and the colors and details were impressive. This is clearly what this TV was designed to do. No complaintsI played Ninja Gaiden Sigma(720P) on PS3 and it looked amazing. The background was so beautiful I couldn't even play the game. I was just staring at the details and vivid colors. Once I have broken-in this TV (at least 100-200hrs) I will play more games. I get nervous about image retention. However, this TV comes with \"Pixel Shift\" which is supposed to help prevent this problem. Also, there are several built-in programs that will help alleviate the problem if, God forbid, there is image retention. I like that very much and it is a nice feature. I talked to an ISF-trained tech from a local store and he told me with these new plasmas that you would have to leave an image for several hours for \"burn-in\" to occur. He also said that there is no \"break-in\" period like I said above, but that I should NEVER use the DYNAMIC picture setting because it will turn your plasma into toast. So take this for what it's worth. I am being very cautious with my $3000 newborn.What I like:I have DirecTV HD service and the picture is VERY NICE. There is some pixelation during extremely fast action or explosions, but trust me that is the crappy satellite feed and NOT the plasma. No complaints here.What I think is OK:The SD channels are good, but not great. It definitely varies from channel to channel and this, again, may just be DirecTV. Don't get me wrong they are MUCH better than on my Samsung LCD, just not amazing or anything. I am so spoiled. It's funny, you'll be watching a show in SD and the picture is not so good and then it goes to commercial and they look awesome. I guess what they say is true \"Garbage in, Garbage out.\"Other observations:I only listened to the sound for about 10 minutes because I have 7.1 surround, but it sounded good and that is all I will comment on that.I read that the pevious model Samsung 5054/64 has problems with judder or skipping frames with tickers(CNN,ESPN,etc.) on the bottom of the screen. I don't see this problem and I am LOOKING for it big-time. Nothing that I can detect. Do not worry about this cause it is not a problem.Sorry about the long review, but I know there is not much out there on this one. I can't wait to see what the fellas/gals at CNET or CR have to say. Good Luck and feel free to ask me about anything specific.Update Jan. 7, 2008I have had this tv for 6 months now and I have no regrets. I will say that it can get very hot and doubles as a heater. Especially after watching for several hours. But it is a minor annoyance.The picture is still fantastic and I would put it up against a Pioneer Kuro anyday. It will absolutely destroy a Panasonic. They are very good plasmas, but I would go with SAMSUNG everytime. I saw the price has dipped below $2000 for this set now. People, if you want a 50\" 1080p Plasma, DO NOT WAIT. THIS IS YOUR SET. I love it and it is my baby...You can thank me later.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "When I turned it on, I simply said...WOW.", "Author": "RW \"RW\"", "ReviewID": "R35AWRS6CKHWN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a significant amount of research and a post in response to one of the other great reviews here on Amazon regarding this product, I decided to take the plunge.  I was looking for a TV that had the following qualitites:  1080P, 3 HDMI inputs a beautiful piano gloss black casing and a reasonable value (Pioneer Elite need not apply).  I went to BB to look at all of the TV's both plasma and LCD \"side by side.\"  Because I watch mostly sports, I badly needed a smooth picture during fast action.  I noticed that even the good LCD's still have frequent pixelization.  I decided to go back to a different BB just to double check and I did indeed see the same thing.I have had 2 Panasonic plasma TV's in the past and they were very good, but the Panasonic 1080P model that has 3HDMI inputs is significantly overpriced and just not as physically appealing as the Samsung.  When I turned on the TV and switched to an HD channel, I literally said, \"WOW.\" outloud.  The difference in brightness, detail, clarity, and picture smoothness were evident immediately over the 50\" Panasonic that I had purchased only 6 months ago!  I was immediately thrilled with my purchase.  After hooking it up to a Toshiba Up-Converting DVD player, I was amazed once again.  The picture on this TV is absolutely amazing.  Even my wife, who is not a techie, noticed immediately how wonderful the picture is.Positives:-It's hard to imagine a better picture.-3HDMI inputs-1080P capability-Beautiful Piano Gloss Black finish-Great stand that is piano gloss black and also swivels-Very reasonable price point for 1080P-1 Set of inputs on side of TVNegatives:-The speakers are on the side for a cleaner look and the sound is horrible.  It's downright bad.  Use your surround sound system.-To go from one source to the next you must press the source button several times vs. pressing it and choosing which source you want through directionals on remote.", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Mixed feelings about this plasma", "Author": "R. Reed", "ReviewID": "ROPT2XKWZS6BW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV a few days ago and I have mixed feelings about it.  Here's what I like and dislike about the set.Likes:- Aesthetically it is one of the nicest flatscreen TVs I've ever seen.  I also purchased the SANUS Flat Panel TV Stand for the set and it looks fantastic on the stand- Picture quality is stunning Dynamic mode.- Sound quality is above average for a television- Excellent value for the money, 50\" 1080P for under $2400--what a steal!Dislikes:- picture quality (PQ) on older non-HD channels is terrible.  I was watching an old NBA game on ESPN Classics and it was unwatchable.  I tried tweaking the settings, but nothing really improved the picture.- the PQ was about the same--and at times--not as good as my wife's Panasonic 720p Plasma.  I'm hoping it was due to a weak cable signal.- The picture seemed somewhat washed out while using \"Movie\" mode- Phoned Samsung for a minor issue and they were no helpConclusion:I'm on the fence about this TV and will probably swap out my TV cables and try some setting I found on the Internet.  I'll update this post with my results.Updated on 8/21/07:The PQ on HD channels is mesmerizing; especially, Discover HD and NFLNet.  I find myself watching these channels more and more because of their excellent PQ.  I've decided to deal with the poor PQ on the non-HD channels since they'll probably be going away in the year or two.  Also I'm planning on purchasing a Blueray DVD player to experience the full potential on this set.After a couple of weeks and endlessly tweaking the settings on the TV, I've come to the conclusion that the default settings provide me with the best PQ.  However, I did change the following setting:Color Tone: Cool1Digital NR: AutoDNIe: OnUnder the \"Detail Menu\":Black Adjustment: HighColor Space: AutoEdge Enhancement: OnHope this Helps", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Absolutely worth every penny......", "Author": "Amanda M. Hamblin \"Gee\"", "ReviewID": "RAU6JQ2IIFBZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I would like to say that SD channels do not look very good on this set. But unlike some reviewers, I know this is to be expected. Whenever you have a 480i/p image, spread over 50 inches of screen, and over 2 million pixels, it's a no-braner that quality is going to suffer. So, just deal with it until all or the majority of channels are fed in HD.Now, to the review. First, HD quality is phoenominal, as expected. I have directv and the uality is great. But this pales in comparison to Blue-ray quality. It is razor sharp and superbly colored, even at factory settings. Bottom line is, if you understand that SD on such a Hi-Res and Large screen, is going to be poor, you'll be extremely happy with you're purchase. If you expect every channel to look like a Blue-Ray movie, you'll be very disappointed.Secondly, you need to understand formatting. You're likely going to have to stretch you're image on you're screen. Unless the movie you're watching is in a certain format, it will NOT fill the entire screen. This brings us back to the poor SD quality. If you fill the screen, the image will be stretched in order to do so. This makes the SD quality even worse. But you can't blame the TV, it's the television stations and broadcasters, who are still broadcasting in such a low res, poor quality, that is to blame.Thirdly, the set is a plasma. It draws lots of power and puts out alot of heat. But this is normal for a large plasma television. So don't be alarmed.Fourthly, the anti-glare coating Samsung uses in this set is outstanding. I have very little to no glare at all from my lamps/windows. I'm very pleased with this.Fifthly, the sound from the set sucks. Don't buy this and run sound through them. You're movie/viewing experience will suffer greatly. Get a decent surround setup, with a good subwoofer and you'll be very pleased with you're overall experience.Lastly, like all high end sets, this tv is at the mercy of the quality of the signal being fed. Give it a high res source, and you'll be floored by the quality of picture. Blacks are very black and 1080P through Blue-Ray is untouchable.Overall, fantastic value. Excellent features, near perfect picture.", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "The One Real Con", "Author": "Andrew Alden", "ReviewID": "R2J123YMF0KKYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV today and am very tech savvy. I know all there is to know about interlaced vs. progressive, resolutions of different formats, hdmi vs. dvi vs. vga, as well as 480i, 720p, 1080p.. you get the picture, no pun intended.That being said, take it from an expert techie that this is without a doubt the best 50\" HDTV available on the market, and I HAVE looked everywhere. (I have seen a 58\" Plasma from Samsung as well that is mind-blowing.. but for around a grand more that is out of most people's price range.)I bought this unit for 2300.00 from Best Buy today, and getting their credit card doubles RewardZone points, essentially giving me 10% back for the entire cost of the unit on top of that. Don't let their 2800.00 price tag fool you, you can talk them down alot on this baby if you get a warranty and buy a couple accessories. Getting a competitor in on the deal helps too. They love to fight with H.H. Gregg :)Pricing aside, I love absolutely everything about this TV. I did my homework, looked at literally hundreds of HDTV's, and from store to store this one consistantly outranked the rest.ABSOLUTELY AMAZING:-Picture Quality. Best, bar none. You will not find better. I promise.-Viewing angle and anti-glare. Screen can been seen in true color from ANY angle, but because of the way the anti-glare is designed, the display looks fuzzy if you are close and at a very sharp angle. Anything 170 degrees or less looks spectacular. I get no glare from any angle in a room with multiple lamps on each side of the television. It's as good as a matte LCD with the durability of plasma's glass.-Side input has EVERY type of connection. HDMI, USB, S-Video and RCA. All there for your video game systems :)-USB Connectivity is pretty cool and much better than expected. Can browse folders and play MP3 / WMA's, as well as view or slideshow pictures.NEGLIGIBLE CONS:-Switching sources is a bit slow, and the remote seems to have some lag. You cannot quickly (under a second) switch from channel to channel or switch sources. Minor inconvenience.-USB Connectivity is great, but cannot play video. (Probably due to throughput issues)-The sound is bad. It is loud and fills the room, but is completely devoid of bass. This is to be expected. You're buying a TV. Whatever crappy speakers they have to tack on to a near-flat unit are there for CONVENIENCE, not quality. Get a nice reciever (Yamaha) and some decent speakers, and hook it all up via Optical. Remember, the RECIEVER makes for great sound, not 600.00 Klipsh speakers. I spent $600.00 on my reciever and $80 on my speakers, so trust me.-The unit can get pretty dang hot. This is completely normal for plasma TV's, but heat significantly reduces the life of any electronic device. For that reason, I hooked up 3 silent fans to the back of my TV. The unit is very well vented both on the top and on the back, so I found some Just Cooler monitor fans that even had a perfect hanging hook and an enclosure that work and fit PERFECTLY for this unit. GET THESE. They're silent, really move some air, and will keep your TV alive. The only downside is they use a molex connector found in any computer to get their power. A simple molex power adapter found in any external 3.5\" hard drive enclosure will power these babies with a wall socket. See a review and pictures here:[...]THE ONE REAL CON:-Picture in Picture. Samsung added this feature, but it is basically worthless. The TV has one tuner that handles not only flipping digital channels, but also EVERY digital input. This means that you CANNOT view anything other than an ANALOG SECONDARY COAX INPUT ONLY inside PiP. In other words, you don't even have an input button for the PiP box. It draws from the 2nd Analog Coax input only. That being said, PiP has a few modes such as split-screen, but is ALWAYS locked at 4:3 ratio since it's analog only.Don't buy this thinking I must be crazy and that you can watch a blu-ray while your son uses the PC input or plays PS3. Won't happen.. I have triple verified. While this makes PiP pretty worthless, is not enough to keep me from loving my TV. Most people rarely or never use PiP anyway.OVERALL:I'd give this thing 6 stars if I could. Read the reviews, save up 2.5 grand, and do yourself a favor. Don't even bother looking elsewhere, this TV is unbeatable :)", "Date": "September 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "So you want a new review?", "Author": "Michael A. Jacobs", "ReviewID": "R3PDOOVQTKH8MU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...everyone is asking for another person's perspective - so here goes...  First, this TV is massive.  Its one thing to see it at the store, but taking it out of the box and squeezing it into a SUV to take home (not purchased from Amazon) is another.  With the size comes weight. At around 100#'s you need to think ahead on this one.  After dead lifting this thing onto the TV stand I sat and admired this piece of work.  Quality plastic bezels, wonderfully sized screen, all without being tacky or cheap.  After hooking it up and running through the menu for a quick few minutes, I realized that there is quite a bounty of options from the typical color balance to the most welcomed screen burn-in support.  I haven't spent much time tinkering around but I must say it's a nice setup.  After surfing for a while on both SD and HD stations I would say that the SD channels are on par with what one would expect from a 480i.  The real gem is seeing the 1080i channels (no 1080p channels yet).  I was ready to reach out and touch the screen given the size and resolution I was looking at.  Though I don't watch 'Wheel of Fortune', once aired on 1080i I was ready to take a spin!  As far as movies are concerned I haven't hooked up my DVD player to it yet, but that review will be added on.  I do, however, have my Wii connected and it looks great through component cables.  I haven't noticed picture quality issues with either regular TV station or during gaming, but you do get out what you put in.  The sound quality on the stock speaker setup is farley nice, though I'll be upgrading to 5.1.  The arrangement of the silver side bezel actual pans the sound from the back of the unit and spreads it around the room more effectively.  The remote is what it is, either you like it or hate it.  It has some nice button setups so you don't have to go hunting for things in the main menu.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this TV if you're looking for a nicely designed TV with great picture quality.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate.Update: The image on the Amazon site is not the FPT5084 model.  Go to Samsung.com and check out the actual image.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV but I got a bad unit", "Author": "Mikey \"Videophile\"", "ReviewID": "R1FIPCO3EQW7T2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before purchasing a HDTV.  I considered LCD at first (Sony's top of the line looks good) however I feel that the colors on LCDs are a bit too vivid and at times even cartoony.  Plasma has the quality of a CRT which I believe looks best but 50 inch tube sets don't exist and if they did they would probably weigh 1000 pounds.So I ordered this TV about three weeks ago from Amazon.  Hard to beat a great price, no tax, and no shipping.  I ordered it on a Sunday and it arrived the following Saturday.First off I am truly impressed by the picture quality - especially in HD.  Almost true to life.  Standard definition quality depends on the input.  Using the built in tuner with a standard definition signal results in a fairly decent picture.  However I have found that with an HDMI 480i input the TV does its best to deinterlace the signal but introduces odd vertical banding upon closer inspection.  Using the component input does't exhibit this artifact.  I believe this might be my old Moxi cable box or perhaps the nature of displaying a low resolution picture on a high resolution panel - I need to do some further experimentation.Update:  It's the TV that is causing the vertical banding when the input is at 480i.  From a distance it cannot be noticed.  An HD signal is the way to go with this TV.I have connected the plasma to my Xbox 360 through the component cables.  Unfortunately I have an older Xbox without the HDMI output.  I was happy to find the TV accepted the Xbox output of 1080p.  I also have the HD-DVD drive attached to the Xbox but unfortunately when playing movies the Xbox will only output 1080i.  In order to get 1080p when watching HD movies I need to use the VGA input (new cable) or get a newer Xbox 360 with the HDMI output.  Nevertheless the HD-DVD movies look fantastic even at 1080i.  I suppose the set might deinterlace the 1080i films to 1080p internally through a 3:2 pulldown process the specs say nothing of this however.Update:  TV does not support 3:2 pulldown with 1080i input however I'm not sure if one would notice.I have also experiemented with connecting this TV to my computer which supports 1920x1080 through an HDMI cable.  I was surprised to find that at 1920x1080 @ 60 hertz the characters on the screen appeared a bit blurred.  I suspect that the HDMI input at 60 hertz causes the set to use the scaling circuitry that introduces some artifacting (that's just guess).  When I set the computer to output 1920x1080 @ 30 hertz the characters appear crisp and clean.  Bit of a bummer since its all about having a high refresh rate when using this panel as a monitor.  I haven't tried the VGA input yet but maybe it will bypass the scaling circuitry.Update:  Changing the TV to \"Just Scan\" bypasses the scaling and results in a fantastic 60 hz picture.So now the bad news.  After a couple of weeks of watching some steller HD content my television started to turn off sporatically.  Now it doesn't turn on at all.  When I plug it in I hear some relays click a few times as if its trying to start up and then silence for a few seconds, then click a few times...  There is another reviewer on this site that wrote about the same problem so I know I'm not alone.  Looks like there may be a few defective units out there.  At any rate I called Amazon and they are going to send me a replacement.  I haven't given up hope on this TV just yet.  Hopefully I just got a lemon and it's not a pervasive problem.  I'll let you know...Update:  The replacement TV arrived in a week.  No complaints and I'm still in love.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Mine arrived with a cracked screen", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "RSJZTLI91D07Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this set on Thursday, October 11th, and it arrived exactly a week later, on Thursday, October 18. For free shipping, not bad at all.After calling two days in advance to notify us of the date and four hour delivery window, Eagle arrived on schedule and carried the set down some stairs to my lower level family room. Unfortunately, my wife did not insist that the delivery guys open the box to examine the contents before they left, but in fairness them, they offered to do so and my wife thought it unnecessary. Grrr.So...I spent all day on Saturday buying cables, drilling holes, installing a wall mount, stringing speaker wire etc..., and on Sunday morning I was ready to unbox this baby, hang it on the wall and let the good times roll.The set is shipped sitting upright on its stand, and you open the cardboard box it comes in by lifting straight up a single piece that constitutes the top and all four sides of the box. Afterwards, the set remains standing in a remaining bottom piece of the box, covered in a thin protective padding material. The bottom part of the TV and the stand were further protected by some large styrofoam pieces. So far, so good.After digging out the plastic bag that contains the manual, remote, registration card, etc..., I reviewed the \"getting started\" guide and I was ready to proceed. While facing the back of the set I cut off the thin protective material, and then summoned my wife to help me lift my new toy from the bottom of the box so I could attach the wall mount brackets. Just as we were squatting down to lift, my 9-year-old and very excited daughter asked, \"Dad, what are those thin little lines on the screen?\"Thin little lines, you say? What thin little lines? We don't need no stinking thin little lines! But sure enough, there they were. Lots of long, thin, profane cracks in the glass. Oh, the humanity.After regathering my composure, my first call was to Eagle. The lady who answered the call asked for my shipment and phone number, and promised to have someone call me on Monday. She also suggested that I notify Amazon. I did so, and after requesting a phone call via Amazon's online help page, a nice Indian gentleman called me almost immediately. He was a bit difficult to understand, but he assured me that I would receive an email from Amazon in 2-3 days acknowledging the problem and indicating the status of a replacement TV. He also assured me that I would not be charged any shipping expense in the exchange.A couple of hours later I got an email from Amazon asking me to reply to the following questions about the problem:- What specifically is damaged on the television and when did it occur?- Does the damage prevent the television from functioning properly?- Did you sign the delivery checklist?- Have you contacted Samsung about Warranty service, and if they wereunable to assist you, what is the case number you were given?Although I'm assuming this was largely a form letter, the tone of the questions sounded a bit ominous to me, so I replied by saying that I assumed the damage occured in transit, that I didn't know (or care) whether the TV still worked since I never removed it from the box and never plugged it in, and that I had not contacted Samsung Service as I didn't consider this to be a serviceable problem. I just want a replacement TV. I haven't heard back from them yet.I know this \"review\" is long and has nothing to do with the quality of the Samsung 5084, but I thought I'd post it anyway for the benefit of those who are wondering (like I had) exactly what happens in the event that the \"unthinkable\" happens and you order a $2,281 TV from Amazon that arrives broken. Since Amazon's communications have so far been good and I have no reason to fault anyone at this point, I'm leaving 5 stars.I'll update this post as things play out, and hopefully we'll all come away from my unfortuate experience with renewed confidence that Amazon can be trusted to do the right thing even for big ticket items like my broken flat screen. I suspect they will.**** UPDATE November 3, 2007 ****I'm happy to report that Amazon replaced my damaged TV promptly (within a week or so) and without any conflict. Everyone with whom I came into contact, including the Eagle delivery people, were apologetic about the damage, courteous and thorough. After lodging the original damage report via Amazon's telephone contact service, subsequent communications with them were all handled via email. I did speak with Eagle a couple of times by telephone to arrange for pickup of the broken TV and delivery of the replacement. All in all, a very good ending to what could have been a very bad experience. Three cheers for the good guys.Regarding the TV itself, it simply rocks. Like any TV it can only be expected to be as good as the signal you provide it (don't expect to be blown away by standard definition channels because you won't be - they are only so-so), but give this thing a clean hi-def signal and you'll be amazed at the depth, clarity and color it delivers. My daughter and I watched \"Happy Feet\" this morning over 1080i digital cable, and the image quality was stunning. I can't wait to see what it can do with a BlueRay 1080p feed, which my daughter and I hope to accomplish in the future using a PS3. Santa, I hope you're reading this too.", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "What's the Buzz and Where's the Glare?", "Author": "Mike W", "ReviewID": "R1ITHRC0BW574O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update 2-28-2012: Samsung Plasma TV's don't last and they don't stand behind their products.  For more info go to my facebook page \"Samsung Blows - Fuses on Fp-T 5084 Plasma TV\"Update 6-8-2011: Another blown fuse. I cut an access to get to fuse easy as suggested by another reviewer.  I'm lowering my rating to one star because Samsung will not admit there is a problem with this TV.----------------------------------------------------------------------Update 4-27-2011: Almost 3 years and the TV cut off. No sound, Picture, Red indicator light.  I called a few TV repair shops who wanted a minimum of $200 to fix with no warranty.  I did some research on-line and found the problem is a 250v 12A ceramic slow-blow fuse and there is a You-tube video to show you how to replace.  There is two fuses and I recommend changing both since they are so inexpensive.  This fix lasted only 4 months so be prepared to do it again and again.  Buy plenty of fuses because it will cost a lot for shipping and no one sells these fuses locally.  I'm going to use another reviewers suggestion to cut an access hole where the fuses go next time they blow.  It's worth fixing yourself for a couple dollars then to get rid of it!----------------------------------------------------------------------I'm no expert on TVs, but I feel I owe this to others on the fence between plasma and LCD.  I have been on the fence now for about 4 months and read many reviews, reports, and visual comparisons on differences between the two.  After much turmoil between them, I have decided on the Samsung 5084.  This plasma is replacing my 36\" JVC family room TV.How I made my choice was:First off, you can't go wrong with either choice.  LCD's seem to cost much more in the 50\" or larger size.  In my case, the 52\" Sharp LCD I was looking at cost $600 more then I paid for my plasma.  It seems there is not much of a difference in picture quality.  The sales people in Best Buy and Circuit City want to sell you the LCDs for some reason.  I'm not saying you shouldn't listen to them, but, they couldn't give me a good enough reason to swing me.  They tell you go for the LCD because of the dull finish to reduce light glare.  I didn't see much glare on the Samsung to sway me.  Even under the bright lights in those stores.  Some will tell you there is loud buzzing which comes from plasmas, but, that is if you live in a high elevation area.  I live in Southern New Jersey and I have to say, I hear no buzzing.Before TV was delivered:Buy the HDMI cable for best resolution in advance of delivery.  If you are using Comcast, be sure to get the new cable box that allows you to connect HDMI from box to TV.  You might have to go to a few stores till you find one.  Comcast may even give you the cable.After TV was delivered:I like to say I was prepared, (for better or worse) after reading some of the horror stories.  I had everything ready for the delivery men, all they needed to do was take TV out of box, connect HDMI cable, and plug it in.  A little on the delivery first; TV came in not even a week after I ordered it (2 weeks ahead of the promise date) and was delivered a couple days latter.  The guys were very nice and moved the big 36\" JVC to another room for me.  They unpacked the plasma, set it up, turned it on to be sure it worked, and offered to take the packaging with them (which I didn't take them up on, just in case).  Don't forget to tip them.  I read some reviews where the TV came in damaged, so I checked the box carefully before it was unpacked.  Mine was fine!Setting up TV:I had a little problem finding cable channels, but that was my dumb fault.  There is a setting you need to go into and change TV to HDMI.  After you do that, WOW is all I can say, WHAT A PICTURE.  Now, a little on the Glare Problem so many have written about.  You have to be kidding!  It is far better then my old 36\" JVC.  I would not let glare stop me unless you are used to watching TV in a very dark room.  You should be fair to yourself, if you saw glare before with your old TV and it didn't bother you, why should it now.  But, if it does, pay the extra $600 and enjoy your perfect world.  Please don't get mad at me!  But, this was one of my main concerns as to swing for the LCD.  And to be honest, I see less glare with the plasma compared to the old TV.DVD:I was under the impression you needed a HD DVD or Blu Ray to watch movies; but, that is not true.  Sure, I won't get that perfect 1080p picture.  But, at least for now I don't have to plunk down another $300 for HD or Blu.Ray.  For now or until the war is over, stick with what you have.  If you are like me, it won't bother you much for now.First week and Conclusion:Yes, I have not had the TV very long.  I hope I helped some people on the fence between plasma and LCD.  Normally I don't say so too much in a review, however, I'm sure people have many questions I hope I addressed.  Like I said in the beginning, I'm no expert.

Nelson", "ReviewID": "RSQWJR1Y7RKOH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The first TV delivered to my house was damaged in transit. Amazon very graciously exchanged it for a new one.  While waiting for the replacement TV to come, I enjoyed this one, except for the disturbingly loud buzzing that emanated from the back of the set, particularly when the screen was brightly lit (i.e., loudest buzzing on a pure white screen).  The replacement TV that eventually came experienced the same buzzing, only 10 times worse.  Also, within about two months, an entire row of pixels went black.  In about the bottom third of the screen, I now have a black line exactly one pixel high the full width of the TV.  Hmm.  Is that bud luck, or what.  Too late to send back to Amazon (only 30 day window for return), so I contact Samsung customer service.BEWARE of Samsung customer service.I'm informed that a third party support company will come out and look at my TV.  They do, and confirm that the panel is bad.  I'm told, however, that they will replace the panel, and not the TV.  At least they leave it in the meantime, so I'm not without a TV, although I am suffering with a defective one.One month later, still no replacement panel.  The third party support company indicates that Samsung keeps promising to ship one, and keeps not shipping it.  The third party support company submitted a request for a replacement TV, given the time that had elapsed, but Samsung DENIED this request, apparently hoping to run out the clock on a 12 month warranty by indefinitely delaying a replacement part.  I checked \"my samsung\" to track the status of my repair, and have verified that the part is \"on order\" with an estimated ship date of \"00/00/0000.\"  I'm optimistically interpreting that as the year 10,000 AD, not 20,000 or 30,000.  We'll see, though.In short, don't buy a Plasma from Samsung.  The buzzing is apparently endemic, they don't stand behind their products, and I'm lucky to have my panel develop a black line (another common problem with plasmas, apparently) while still within the anemic 12 month warranty period.

Hoar \"hoarj\"", "ReviewID": "R2UK9SOPA0AWZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know why I am writing this, as others with more technical knowledge than me have already done better.  I guess I am just excited to have it and I want to share.  A couple of points.1) This is my first wide screen/flat panel/digital/HDTV, so maybe I am naive.  But from the minute I turned it on, it has blown me away.  Same goes for every member of my family and every friend who has seen it.  On a 1080p signal, the picture is unbelievable.  The picture is bright and clear from almost any viewing angle and -- despite the fact that the screen is very shiny -- it is very resistant to glare, much more so than my old 27\" tube TV.  The problem (if there is one) is, the acuity of the visual detail makes it difficult to actually pay attention to either movies or sports.  Instead of watching the action, I find myself trying to read the time off a spectators' watch in the stands (which you can almost do), or look at the details in the background of a film scene.  I guess I'll get used to it eventually . . . .2) Even when it is not turned on, this TV is beautiful.  It is elegant with its glossy \"black piano\" finish.  They guy who delivered it (see below) told me that he delivers between 10 and 20 wide screens a day, and he thinks this one is the nicest looking.  I hung it on my wall using a bracket I also bought from Amazon, and right now I think I am the coolest thing since sliced bread.3) Shipping re: Eagle USA.  For some reason, Amazon seems to keep this a bit of a mystery, but I had an excellent experience.  Eagle got it to me in about four days instead of the predicted ten.  Here's what to do:  Track your shipment's progress via Amazon's tracking/\"where's my order\" page.  When it says your TV has arrived in your city (or nearby), call Eagle at 800-888-4949 to arrange for delivery.  They will negotiate a day and time.  In my experience, they arrived exactly when they said they would (the next day).  Two men carried it in, unpacked it, plugged it in to show me that it worked, and then took away all the packing materials (which are huge) for recycling.  I could not have asked for any better service.4) Blu-Ray/HDMI:  Along with this TV, I bought a Sony Blu-Ray DVD player.  I can't even find words to explain how amazing the picture is on this TV from a Blu-Ray DVD.  However, to get the full 1080p effect (from a Blu-Ray or any other component) you need to connect them with HDMI cables.  The benefit is that you can get both full 1080p digital video and amazing digital sound from a single cable.  The drawback is that if you have to buy HDMI cables at retail, they start at $50 for a three-foot cable and go up from there.  If you order one of these TVs online and anticipate needing HDMI cables, my advice is that you order the necessary cables online (you can find them cheap if you search) at the same time to avoid having to pay retail after delivery.In closing, I can't recommend this set highly enough.  Amazon currently has it for less than $2,000 with no taxes and free shipping.  I don't believe you can beat that deal for a TV of this quality anywhere.", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wow, So Far That's All I Can Say is Wow", "Author": "Mishima Triad", "ReviewID": "R1QJQNS1E1CVZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for almost 3 weeks now and it is amazing. This is my first plasma TV so I'll try not to be biased in my review as I've viewed many HDTV's; but there could obviously be some. In shopping for a plasma screen, I had narrowed my selection down to this TV and the Panasonic TH-50PZ700U which is also a 50\" 1080p plasma. I looked at both of them in stores and really couldn't tell much difference in picture quality (though the signal feeds were crappy at all the places I looked). As far as features go, both models were about the same, roughly the same number of inputs, except that this one has 3 HDMI inputs as opposed to the Panasonic that only has 2. Ultimately I decided to get this TV based on the price, Amazon.com had a great deal at the time.So far, I have not been disappointed with this decision at all. The picture quality on the TV straight out of the box was great. I hooked up my PS3 via HDMI and played a Blu-ray movie and several games and they looked fantastic right off the bat. Initially I hooked my cable directly into the back of the TV so I could pick up the local HD channels, since I only had a digital box and the TV can decode HD signals (it was a weekend so I couldn't get an HD box until Monday and had to see football in HD). I went and got an HD box as soon as I could, hooked it up through HDMI and it has looked fantastic - I've been watching a lot of football and college basketball and I really don't see how it could look much better. Of course I've tweaked the settings some, this TV has a plethora of picture settings that you can play with as I'm sure most high quality plasma's do. I have my day and night settings, which both work wonderfully to get the picture just like I want it. Also, the glare on the TV is minimal at most. I have the TV right beside a sliding glass door so there is always sun shining in through the blinds during the day and it has little to no effect on my viewing (it was much worse on my CRT that I replaced with this).Samsung says that there is no break in period for this TV; but after reading on A/V forums ([...] is a good place to go to learn some stuff) and my own experience, I would say that you should still give it a break in period for at least the first 100 hours. From what I read, pretty much any plasma is going to need this, even the newer ones that say they don't. Samsung does not give settings for the break-in for this model; but you can look at the settings for the HTP-5064 and use those for this one (because most of the menu items are the same). I have had a couple of cases of image retention (IR), not to be confused with screen burn in - one from watching football on NBC for about 8 hours last Saturday as they keep that stupid peacock and score bar down at the bottom all the time and the other from playing an old video game for about 3 hours straight. The good news is that the TV has several built-in tools to erase IR and they work quite well. They also say that usually image retention will go away as you watch other stuff; but I haven't wanted to take the chance so I've used the built in tools and they work like a charm. I've also read that IR should almost never occur after the first 200-300 hours of use; I'm not there yet, so I can't say; but hopefully this is the case (or I might have to change my review).So now that I've reviewed the TV, I'll talk briefly about my Amazon.com experience. Getting the TV and extended warranty plan was no problem; but getting up to that point was. I had a lot of trouble getting an Amazon.com store card (so I could do the no interest financing) and with my spotless credit history, it really ticked me off. Then I didn't get approved for as much as I needed to get the TV and extended warranty so I had to do this roundabout mess to order and still use the card on the purchase. Anyway, it was a big hassle; but once the order was placed everything was good. Eagle got it to my local distribution center very promptly. The only problem there was that I saw online that they had checked it into my local distribution facility on a Friday so I called to set up a delivery time and they told me they wouldn't be able to deliver it until the next Wednesday, which I thought was ridiculous. So I just went and picked it up myself; no hassle there other than just driving out there and getting a friend to help me out.So anyway, very long story short; I have been very happy with this purchase so far.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great overall!

Durant \"AV addict\"", "ReviewID": "R27H8WSIR85L62", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I've had the TV for about a week and a half now.  Overall, it's a nice upgrade from the professional series Panasonic EDTV it replaced (HDTV is defined as 720p or higher, while EDTV displays something more like 480p, in case you are wondering).  All the details pop out, and as long as the feed is good (generally the determining factor regardless of what TV you buy) the picture is crisp, clean, bright and vibrant.  There are plenty of adjustments as well, edge detail, black extender (to deepen black in dark scenes) something called dynamic contrast, as well as the usual sharpness, brightness and color adjustments.  I spent 4 days playing around until I found the right settings.  Maybe I'm a bit obsessive.Dark scenes do well, still pictures are simply amazing, and with blu-ray discs (PS3) this is probably the best quality video I have ever seen.  You can see Al Michaels on Sunday Night Football like you've never seen him (or wanted to see him) before.  Madden's eyebrows just jump out of the screen.  Sound from the TV speakers isn't bad, but I never really use them anyway, and probably neither will you.  A separate surround sound system is the way to go.  I have only two complaints, really:1. My old EDTV Panasonic somehow displays more vibrant, better colors.  It seems that no matter how I adjust the settings, I just can't duplicate that perfect color.  Even my friends have stated that they aren't sure the \"picture\" on the new set is better than the old one.  It most definitely is better overall, but my friends (who aren't videophiles, obsessed with getting the best picture possible) like the \"picture\" on the old TV better.  I chalk it up to the color.  If you can afford a Panasonic professional display (they are expensive, have few inputs, no built in tuner or sound), along with the extra hdmi inputs you have to buy separately, AND bnc connectors for the component input, AND a switch to deal with all your inputs, I suggest looking at one.  It has more adjustments, and seems to have one of the best over all picture on the market.  But be prepared to spend a pretty penny to go along with the compromises you'll need to make.2. There is a downside to 1080p:  you see all the problems with your video feed more vibrantly: ghosting, poor camera work, distortion, etc.  It's not the display's fault, it's just that the video quality of cable (my wife won't allow a direct TV dish on the house, nor will the building covenants in my development) can be questionable at times.  You don't notice as much with lower resolutions.  But of course you don't get to see the details either.  Just something to keep in mind if you aren't obsessed with getting the best picture possible: 720p or even 480p is plenty good with most feeds for most people.  1080p is really only necessary for blu-ray or highdef DVD to obtain the highest picture quality.My suggestions for the casual TV purchaser: save some money and buy a lower resolution set.  Spend the savings on a good sound system or a new video game system.  However, if you truly appreciate the details that only 1080p can reproduce, this TV is excellent, has more adjustments than the consumer Panasonic products, and generally costs less than the Panasonic professional products, when you add up all the extras you have to buy.  Just be prepared to play with video adjustments for a while before you find the picture you like.", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "No regrets!

The customer service rep (from Texas) was absolutly awesome.  Shipping was free and sales tax was a lot less than if I had picked it up at the store because we're in a rural area with a lower sales tax (sales tax is based on where its delivered).The Samsung replaces a Sony 36\" CRT HD set (1080i) that served me well for four years (I'm loaning it to a friend so he can try out HD).If you are looking at moving up to a 50\" from a 36\" or so like I did you will be completely amazed at how big 50\" is.  The seating in our living room is 8-12 feet from the screen and with the 36\" it was ok.  With the 50\" it is awesome!I moved up to the Samsung primarily for sports and HD gaming (XBOX 360).  The Samsung is perfect for this.  There's so much screen space that even when I'm playing a coop game with my son and we're sharing the screen it doesn't feel crowded at all.There is a \"Game Mode\" selection in the menus.  I've turned it on but am not sure what it does.  It looks great either way.Sound - I've read complaints that the audio is lacking.  Its not as good as my Sony but its not bad.  There is an equalizer in the menu.  I boosted the bass, dropped the midrange a little and boosted the treble.  This definitely helped out.  It could be that many of the reviewers failed to do this.Anyways, to see if I could improve the audio without having to resort to using my home theater setup everytime we watch TV I plugged in my Klipsch Promedia 2.1 setup that was previously hooked up to our Mac (that's a computer in case you didn't know).  I hooked this speaker system into the headphone jack which is located on the left side of the Samsung and of course the audio is now outstanding.  Since there is a lot more room on my TV stand because the Samsung is so much thinner than the 300 lb. behemuth Sony I was able to place the Klipsch speakers (two speakers plus a small subwoofer) behind the Samsung and out of view.I use this Klipsch setup for everything but movies and hardcore gaming sessions - they get the home theater treatment.I agree with most other reviewers - the picture is amazing!  The only shortcoming I've detected so far was when we were watching an HD version of Sleepy Hollow on Dish TV (the version with Johnny Depp).  Although this movie really showcased the ability of plasmas to display very dark black areas (definitely watch this movie next Halloween if you buy a plasma) the lightning scene at the end of the movie kinda freaked out the display.  There were a lot of video artifacts during that specific scene.  You know, a bunch of pixels that don't know what to do so the they get all scrambled up for a milli-second or so.So, if you're really into movies with a lot of lightning scenes you should probably consider a 120 Hz LCD.  Otherwise I have no complaints about anything I've watched so far.Football (or any sports for that matter) really standout on a big screen HD set.  The Samsung is no exception.  I am amazed everytime I watch a game.I am also able to display my photographs on it.  I load them up on a USB thumbdrive plug it in and use the built in slideshow viewer.  You can also play mp3's during the slide show.  My photos (nature and landscape) are shot on 4x5 film (that's 4 inches by 5 inches in case your not familiar with large format film).  The film is then scanned on a drum scanner producing a 300 to 600 MB file.  This is way to big for screen to handle so I use photoshop to bring the image size down to the screen size (1920 x 1080 pixels) and load a bunch of them onto the thumbdrive.  They look absolutely stunning on the big screen!I've also viewed pictures from our Panasonic point and shoot camera and these also are crystal clear on the big screen.The screen has done a great job of reducing reflections.  I've heard otherwise but its way better than my Sony CRT screen at reducing sun light or ambient room light.Its a beautiful TV - but one that needs occasional dusting because of the high gloss black surface.

They put it on the stand for me but did not wait until it was switched on before leaving so I guess that was OK, if I had paid for the white glove delivery I would have been annoyed ($250?) but as it was free I guess it was OK.BTW when I bought the TV white glove delivery was not an option, it came with free standard shipping, which was going to be a problem as I live in a 1st floor apartment and this TV is 120lbs.

I would like to offer my 2 cents worth regarding screen burn-in.  It is real, it is usually permanent, and it happened to me with this Samsung model. I used the screen burn-in protection from the very beginning and it still took less than 10 hours of use (over the course of 3 weeks) with one of my PS3 games to get a nasty case of screen burn-in. I wish I had been more careful and am writing this review with the hope that it saves someone else from suffering the same fate. If you play a video game that displays an item (scoreboard, map, etc.) in the same place for the entire session you are at high risk of that item causing burn-in.  It doesn't take long either!! I made the mistake of assuming that the screen burn-in protection would prevent burn-in. I tried the recommended procedure to mitigate the burn but it proved to be ineffective.

PLEASE NOTE..Do not buy any plasma thinking it won't need sound support. This set does not produce good sound for viewing movies but really none of the plasmas or LCDs do.  Always budget in an sound system of some sort when buying one. Sound quality is not a part of my review because I knew going into a plasma I never intended to use it for sound.Doesn't matter much now since this TV is out of date, but both mine and my Mother-in-law bought the same TV and both had component failures. 1 happened before warranty but then a second component again after warranty. I still like the Samsung brand and have an LED now that I really like and is doing well.

Since I couldn't revise the rating, I decided to write a new one.  Sorry to disappoint Samsung fans, but I felt compelled to write this review, so future shoppers know potential issues.Let me start off by saying that in theory, this TV is great... if you get a good set.  As most reviewers have noted, fabulous picture quality...  Paired it with a Sony home theater system - great results, barring some significant issues.Furthermore, Amazon customer service is superb, so I feel totally comfortable making large purchases on Amazon - from designer shoes to plasma TVs...  Ceva delivery is great, too, although Tuesdays and Fridays make it a big inconvenience.Now to Samsungs.  I don't want to make brand generalizations, but this TV has proven a giant disappointment!  The first set had minor dents on the bezel (was going to live with that)...  However, as I noted in my earlier review, the buzzing sound was audible back on the couch.  My brother's Pioneer is dead silent.  Ok, thought it was a bad set.  Got it replaced.  The second set had buzzing as well - perhaps 25% better.  However, after about 3 weeks, the TV developed random white pixels (dead or hot, annoying!) after about 30 minutes of operating the TV.  I was still in love with the style of this TV, so called Amazon and wanted another replacement.  They couldn't do a 3rd replacement, but allowed me to return it and suggested that I place an order for a new one.  I did.  Arrived yesterday....  with a CRACKED SCREEN.  Now my credit card is charged for 2 TVs and I have zero TVs in my living room.  I'll live with that - I'm convinced Amazon will issue credit promptly.To make a long story short, I'm going with a Sony LCD...

The pictures on Blu-ray were fantastic... I will admit grainy as most Blu rays have that grainy feel which I dislike. The HD-DVD pics were awesome! I've never seen such clarity in the pictures... True you could plop down more than twice the amount for a pioneer or even almost three times that amount for a pioneer elite... but is it worth it? Hell to the NO! HD TV are crisp and fluid. Videogames are top notch! Only knock is the lack of cable card insert unlike previous Samsung Plasmas and the standard Def tv programs.

It is beutiful and operated flawlessly as expected.  I have rated it 5/5.I am writing this review to warn potential buyers of the problems with Eagle Delivery service that Amazon utilizes.  The service is advertised as \"white glove\" This includes delivery to your home, uncrating, setup and removal of packing materials.  Amazon sent the unit out in less than 48 hours.  The tracking service said it had arrived in Denver (the local hub 2 days latter.)  There it sat for 4-5 days with me anticipating a call to arrange delivery.  No call!! Eventually, through forums I was able to contact Eagle.  First they said they had tried to contact us (We received no such call an the answering machine had no message)  Then they said they would arrange the delivery in 1-2 days.  Still OK we were excited.  On the delivery day we received a call from the driver of the delivery truck inquiring if we were home and did we have someone to help him with the TV since he was alone.  After several calls to Eagle (No answer and a hang up on hold for the \"right person\") I gave up.  In the mean time the delivery man had found an assistant and they delivered it to the house.  When asked about setup they replied \"We don't do that, if something went wrong we would be blamed.  We plugged in the TV and it seemed OK and they left.The TV is great, but watch yourself during the delivery process.  I think the TV would still be in Denver if we were not pro-active.

Very happy with the delivery experience from Eagle USA.  I have to admit, I wasn't that impressed with the set at first.  The settings obviously needed to be calibrated.  After several adjustments and tinkering with the settings, the picture looks fantastic.  I have Verizon Fios, and the picture for HD is great, but the SD channels are much better than I expected.  I also have a PS3 hooked up to it, and that is where this set really impressed me.  The blu-ray movies look fantastic.  We watched Ratatouille with the kids at that looks awesome in 1080p.  I really wasn't sure if there would be a noticeable difference, but blu-ray movies on this 1080p plasma screen look incredible.  The speakers for the set are not very good, but most will probably hook it up to a surround sound system anyway.  There is a buzzing sound, but that is only loud enough to hear when the sound is off.  Haven't had any issues with cracking noises yet, but I've only had this set for a couple of days.  I will update this review after a few more days.Update - I've noticed that the set gets a little warm especially on the top.  However, it's not as bad as I expected after reading other reviews.  I have also noticed some cracking noises from the tv, which is from the plastic casing warming up, but that also is not as bad as I thought it might be.  Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase especially considering the price.  The PQ for blu-ray movies is fantasic.  There is still some issues with 'noise' on moving images with HD broadcasts, but that is probably the source more than the HDTV.

If you are hesitant to buy such a delicate and high-dollar item online, then don't let all these glowing reviews persuade you-- your first instinct is absolutely correct.1st TV: Arrived within 4 days, Eagle brought it in, hooked it up, and I noticed a buzzing coming from the back.  This is my first plasma TV, so I didn't know if that was normal but I did know it was annoying.  I called Samsung and asked them if I should hear anything from the back and they said no.  so I refused delivery and sent it back.  I called Amazon 5 minutes later and they were great-- already knew I had refused delivery and quickly processed a replacement.  They also approved after-hours delivery so I wouldn't have to stay home from work like I did on the first one.2nd TV: Also only took 4 days.  Eagle brought this one at night, and the light isn't so good in our living room. They hooked it up and there was no buzzing. The picture looked great, so being too excited I accepted it.  Then a few hours later, I noticed the top bulged up a little.  I went to inspect and noticed that the back of the TV was mashed in, as if the TV had fallen on its back at some point.  I called Amazon and told them, and they said they would pass the information on to their TV department.  The next day I got an e-mail offering me a refund but no exchange.  I called to ask for one more try, then got an e-mail offering me a $375 discount to keep the TV, or a refund, but no exchange.  I called again and finally got the exchange.3rd TV: It arrived, Eagle hooked it up, and it buzzed loudly.  On this one, the buzzing got louder when changing channels or switching to DVD. I also noticed some very odd things: black plastic pieces on the back that were worn down to white, missing labels on the front of the TV that the first two had, odd plastic shavings at the base of the screen, and a few places on the screen that needed to be wiped off. I'm nearly positive this one was refurbished.  I refused delivery.  Eagle will be picking up #2 on Monday and I'm just going to a physical store to buy one.Moral of the story, pay the extra money and buy your TV in a store.  when I started all this at the end of February, the cheapest any store had it was $700 more than Amazon.  Now, not a month later, it's only $200 more.4th TV - I went to a store and bought one of these that night for $100 more than Amazon has it (they went up $120 for some reason).  It was delivered on Saturday by much more knowledgeable guys, and it is flawless!  Absolutely zero buzzing, no scratches, no dents.  This TV is in 10 times better shape than any of the 3 I got before.  These come from different places, I don't know how that works or what determines it but the first three had Enlish and French on the box, the 4th perfect one only had English.  The TV is amazing, and in the store the picture quality blew the other brands away.

Morris", "ReviewID": "R9DQ3TDY1MF8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received the FPT5084 set as a replacement for a different model set that was defective.  At first viewing, this set seemed kind of dim to me, but has brightened up substantially after breaking in.The HD picture quality on this set is excellent with bright rich colors.  There are plenty of picture settings to play around with just to tweak it the way you want, but just altering the basic ones got it where I wanted it.  Watching some of the better HD channels like HD Theater or Discovery HD is a joy.  Can't wait to pair it with a Blu-Ray player to see what this baby can really do!Standard analog TV picture quality is OK at best.  Certainly part of the problem is that standard TV was never meant to be shown at these sizes, yet I have seen better quality standard definition on other large sets.  Thankfully, this problem goes away over time as all programming moves to digital and/or HD next year.  Digital standard TV looks good.The built-in speakers are adequate for TV speakers, but nothing more.  If you want anything besides basic TV sound, you'll need to add additional equipment.The TV comes with 3 HDMI ports and also a Wiselink feature to show and play pictures and music from a USB Flash Memory.The design of the TV is quite elegant. It's a glossy piano black finish, with a subdued blue accent light under the screen.There is definitely a buzz on this set.  It is very noticeable from the backside when I was hooking up cables.  In a quiet room with the TV muted, it's audible out to about 6 feet in front of the TV.  As I usually watch TV from further away, and with volume, this is not a problem.  I have read the buzz is due to grounding strips vibrating against the back cover.  Usually shifting the TV around can reduce the buzz.This TV definitely is subject to Image Retention.  The wife left QVC on all night once and the ghost images from their product info boxes were showing after changing the channel.  Also when we watch too much standard TV with the black bars on the side, the lines are definitely noticeable later on.  Fortunately, Samsung has provided several built-in tools to reduce IR or get rid of it after it occurs.  They also gradually fade on their own after watching other TV shows for several hours.  You'll want to watch standard TV in wide screen mode to minimize the effects.Amazon's price was hundreds less than the big box electronics stores. About 3 weeks after purchasing, Amazon lowered the price even more.  I sent an email asking for a credit of the difference, and had it posted to my credit card the next day.Overall, I'm very happy with this TV and with Amazon.UPDATE: About 5 months after purchasing, the TV died completely.  Wouldn't turn on or do anything.  Called Samsung and they put me in touch with their authorized repair people.  After describing the situation, they knew immediately it the Power Supply that went bad.  I figure this must happen somewhat frequently to be able to diagnose over the phone.  It took 1 week for the part to come in.  They came and replaced it in about 15 minutes and TV has been working great ever since.

I love both of them but I have to say I like the plasma a hair better. The reason why I say I like the plasma better is for 2 reasons. One, the plasma does a better job at displaying dark scenes in tv, blu-ray and dvd movies. No matter what settings I tried I could not get the same visibility in dark scenes on the LCD (unless the brightness was turned up high and then the screen became too light all the way across the screen. The blacklit screen on the LCD was always brighter on the left on right sides of the tv than in the middle. Drives me a little crazy in a dark room and in a dark movie scene.

At first I was going to buy this Hitashi 50' 1080i tv that was on sale for $1599 at Best buy. I went to the store to buy it and changed my mind because it just looked cheap and I knew I would regret it. I am a football fan so I think some of thoes \"Samsung Official HDTV of the NFL\" commercials got to me. Then I started looking at Samsungs and found this one (5084) and loved it but with a price tag of $2,899 it was going to be hard to talk my wife into this purchase. So I did some internet searching and found it on amazon for $2300 with NO TAX AND FREE SHIPPING! Then I knew this was going to happen. We saved over $1000 on this tv. So I ordered it from Amazon. It finaly came to my house but it was broken upon delivery. I called samsung on saturday and told them about the situation and they said someone will get back to me on Monday. I called them on monday and they said that someone was going to call me by the end of the day and that the situation was being taken care of. I didn't get a call that day but I did get an email first thing in the morning saying that my new tv was on its way. So I was very happy with that. They gave me no problems at all with replacing it. So a week later I got the tv and it was all in one peice. I hooked it up and was very very very happy with the picture and the apperarance of this tv. I have some HD channels and a Samsung HT-X250t Home theater system that upconverts to 1080i and the picture looks great on that too. I just would love to get a blu-ray player hooked up to this tv to see its full potential. Some day when they go down in price.All in all I am extremely happy with this tv and would recomend it to anyone that is intrested. I would not rather have any other tv. My friends loved it also.

I never considered a LCD as I found colors on Plasmas to be much more vibrant.  Initially, I was leaning towards the Pioneer Elite 50 inch; howeer, the 1080P was much too pricey and if you are intending to part with a sizeable amount of banknotes to make a flat panel purchase; it can be worth the wait as prices continue to drop.  I've heard/read that Plasma prices for 1080p were going to start to dramatically drop beginning this fall as the manufactuer's ramp up 1080p Plasma production.  Panasonic came out with a 1080P 50 inch a few months back, but the price was over 3 grand with only a 5000 contrast ratio.  Still I pondered what and when will I make this purchase.  Samsung came out with a 1080P 50 inch in the same price range as the Panasonic; had a far better contrast ratio, allowed PC input, ect.  Then the Samsung started to drop in price as fall approached.  Amazon then offered the Samsung at 700.00 off retail; placing it right at the same level as the other discount e-tailers.  I placed the orde, the shipping charge was negated by Amazon and there was no sales tax for my state.  I hoped that the TV would arrive before Labor Day; however, Amazon indicated that it would take 10-12 days.

I did; found a Sony UpConvert DVD player that upconverted up to 1080P; hooked it to the Plasma with a non-Monster HDMI Cable and was greatly pleased.

Needless to say, this product has been incredibly faulty over the course of 2 years.  Also, the first 3 times it was broken, it took at least a month to fix it each time (because that's how long the parts from Samsung took to ship to the repair tech).The first 3 problems were that the screen shut off, and the TV would not turn back on.  On all 3 occasions, I noticed the picture got grainy, mostly notably when the screen was dark (i.e. a man's suit).  The graininess slowly degraded until the TV eventually shut off.  The 4th repair that is on the books is similar.  The picture is getting grainy.  I reported the problem BEFORE the TV shut off permanently because I don't want to be down a TV for an entire month with the NHL playoffs taking place.

I'm not sure why the panel keeps needing replaced, but I hesitate to settle for a panel replacement that may fail in 6, 8, or even 12 months.Samsung offered to replace the TV for an upgrade fee around $300.  That's ridiculous.  They said they could refund the pro-rated value of the TV at just over $1000.  That is also ridiculous (considering I wouldn't pay $500 for this TV again).

I would say I'm only slightly more careful than I was with the CRT.Overall, I'm glad I did not buy an LCD instead. At the time I got this I would have had to pay about $600 more for an LCD with similar performance.I sit about 8 feet from the screen, and I think it is a perfect size.

Desai", "ReviewID": "RGP3P4YS9N25V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have divided this review into four parts: (1) My research on TVs before purchase (2) Post-purchase pre-delivery nail biting :-) (3) Connecting different components (4) Summary. Here goes!I did a fair amount of research on what TV to purchase before buying the Samsung FPT-5084. I am a first-time flat-screen HDTV buyer, and was caught in the Plasma-LCD dilemma for a couple of months. My initial reaction was to go with LCD because I was worried about the \"burn-in\" problem with Plasma TVs. I stood at a Best Buy store and stared at Plasma/LCD TVs for nearly two days (freaked out the customer service guys :-)), and the choice between Plasma/LCDs boils down to the tradeoff of \"burn-in\" in Plasmas versus the \"triple ball effect\" in LCDs. The newer models do significantly eliminate these issues, but there is always a freak chance of it happening. The biggest difference is that the picture in LCDs is much brighter than Plasma. In hindsight, LCDs are too bright for home viewing, and you are better off with Plasma. For me, it finally boiled down to a choice between the Samsung LNT-4671 or the Samsung FPT-5084, and given the size of our living room (viewing distance of 12 feet), the 50\" was the right decision. The 46\" would have been a tad small, and I am glad that I went for the 50\".If you are purchasing the Samsung FP-T5084 (or any Plasma, for that matter) on amazon.com, do not purchase the extended warranty (available for around $300 for 4 years). It does not cover \"screen burn-in\", and in fact the manufacturers warranty also does not cover burn-in even during the warranty period. If your plasma has a screen burn-in one day after purchase, it still is your headache! This is a risk that you take when you purchase a Plasma (albeit, a small risk), but of course, you get better picture quality when compared to LCDs. However, if you purchase the TV at Best Buy (or Circuit City), the store warranty does cover burn-in problems, but the TV in stores is nearly $600 more expensive than on amazon.com, and with the extended warranty will be nearly $1000 more. I decided to take the risk, rather than spend the extra bucks.I purchased the Samsung FPT-5084 from amazon.com on Feb 19th, and it was delivered on Feb 27th by Eagle USA. This is typically longer than usual (from what I gather from other reviews) with the average delivery time being 5 days. Eagle USA has been purchased by Ceva Logistics ([...] and you can get a reasonably accurate delivery estimate from the website. One important thing: If Ceva Logistics does not have your phone number on file, then they will deliver the item without calling you beforehand. To avoid this, I called them (based on the tracking information on the website) and pre-arranged a delivery date + time. The customer service is not very professional during the call, but the actual delivery is done in a good fashion. They bring the TV and install it for you, including a very basic cable connection. Do not expect them to hook up all your components (such as surround sound, etc.). Make sure that you check all the components including physical damage, TV sound, remote control functions, etc. before signing the acceptance letter.I hooked up this TV to a Bose Lifestyle V30 system, which is also 1080p compatible. (I got a professional installation done by Geek Squad, and they are really good.) I used HDMI cables (Monster 1000HD HDMI cable), which is the only 1080p compatible HDMI cable, and the picture quality is great! I was truly blown away with the vibrant colors and surround sound (from my Bose system). The cables you use to connect your TV to different components make a huge difference; so, do spend the extra bucks to get the best possible HDMI cables. To address the other issue of \"glare\" in Plasma TVs. My TV is placed close to a window, and there is adequate sunlight in the room, but so far, I have not seen any glare/reflection issues, but I do keep the blinds closed. There is no \"buzzing sound\" coming from the TV either (as I read in other reviews), and the TV does not get hot even after continuous viewing for over 5 hours. Unfortunately, I am not much of a gamer, and can offer no opinions on the subject.Overall, the TV is really really good, and the only reason why I give it 4 stars is because if you do not wish to connect it to a surround sound system, you might be a little disappointed with the sound effects. My surround sound installation was done a week after I got the TV; so, I could make out the difference between the original TV sound and the Bose system. There is no comparison...the original sound pales in comparison. But, again, it isnt too bad either.One final comment: While Pioneer and Panasonic seem to have the bulk of the Plasma TV market, I think the Samsung FP-T5084 matches up really well with its competitors at a much lesser price. I did not see any Pioneer sets, but I did compare this TV to Panasonic TVs, and I liked this one better.Hope this input helps all the potential buyers.

I spent plenty of time researching which set to get and lots of trips to Best Buy and Circuit City showed me that this was the one to get. Right after I ordered my set, my sister purchased a 52\" Sony Bravia for nearly double the price of my set ($3000 vs $18XX) and though her set is amazing, mine was a much better deal considering the features and picture quality are nearly identical between the 2 units. When using the same source material any differences were usually in this sets favor.Common Issues: Others have complained about buzzing (mine only buzzes with a fully white screen), poor sound quality (sound quality is average for a tv nothing terrific or terrible), etc. Out of all of the problems I've read about in reviews the only one that I have is with the set generating heat, but it isn't that bad.Amazon and Eagle: Ordering the tv was obviously quick and easy and the set shipped the same day. Tracking the package wasn't as easy, but then I didn't try very hard to find Eagles site and tracking tools, so I used Amazon's and they didn't offer a lot of info. Delivery was quick and painless, the guys were in and out within 10 minutes and took the packaging with them. The price on the set dropped a couple of times since my purchase and Amazon issued refunds within hours of me emailing them about it.Conclusin: All in all it was a great experience and I'll definately buy my next Samsung hdtvs through Amazon.", "Date": "February 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice!", "Author": "J.

While this is definitely the case, any amount of online research would have told them this (especially if they bought one secondhand, a few years after it came out), and go figure...it's almost 6 years old.Another relevant point would be that this set was Samsung's first attempt at a 1080p plasma screen TV, and you know what the folks say about \"firsts\"...kind of a buyer-beware type of situation.The fuse replacement is NOT THAT HARD. Personally, I am quite tech-savvy, but even for those who are not, all the repair process involves is removing screws (so easy, a caveman could do it), and replacing a fuse or two (again, anyone who knows what a fuse looks like - even those who don't, there are DIY repair videos on YouTube).My set was purchased right after it came out and has been handed down to me from my parents. It had already been sent to a repair shop once for what turned out to be the fuse replacement issue. I was away at school, otherwise I would have taken it upon myself to investigate the issue and perform the repair myself.Last summer, what we thought was the same problem resurfaced. This time, I was not so lucky with it only being fuse replacement. Instead, I had to scour the internet for an entire PSU (power supply unit) and replace that...still, at around $80, it was well worth the money and effort I put into buying and replacing it for this set. It was not entirely difficult as the PSU is entirely plug-and-play; there are 4 or 5 connectors that plug into it, and it unscrews and screws directly into the back of the set (under the casing, of course).If this happens to be the case, I have found that there are plenty of replacement PSUs for sale on eBay. Of course, it is worth trying to replace some cheap fuses first, but if that doesn't work, IMHO it's definitely worth replacing the PSU yourself, rather than letting a repair shop do it for ~$300 dollars.THE TV:This set is amazing. Not just for a 6 year old plasma TV, but even by today's standards, this set is really, truly astounding. The color reproduction, the clarity, the deep blacks and blinding whites, it's really just all there. My parents recently purchased a 1080p 55\" LG LED-LCD set, and I definitely still prefer my plasma over their LCD. The contrast between light and dark and the brightness of colors on the plasma is really incredible. This set is why there are people who still prefer plasma over LCD technology; the pixel response time is next to 0 (which means there is no ghosting during motion scenes), the black it can produce is deep and unaffected by any brightness around it, and it's bright...VERY bright.The disadvantages are the same as they are with most other plasmas: it runs hot, there is a slight potential of burn-in (I've experienced NONE over the course of nearly 6 years), and there can be a slight buzzing noise heard if the set runs for extended periods of time, although that's likely from me repeatedly removing the back cover.This is really a great plasma set, although the fuse and power supply issues are not without merit; this set may be for those who are technically inclined and don't mind performing repairs on their electronics.Keep in mind, it's not like the power supply fails EVERY DAY; we had two problems with it in 6 years...most people won't experience even it that often. Replace the fuses every 4-5 years and you'll be extremely happy with this TV.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV, excellent delivery service.", "Author": "Fyrfyta", "ReviewID": "R3N4GA6EU6I8WW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most of my research for this TV was conducted online.I've found the best information and advice one can get about a product, is from people who have purchased the item, and have had the opportunity to use it.So I read the reviews here, visited a Best Buy for an up-close and in person look; and decided that this TV was the one for me.I was replacing a Mitsubishi WS-55805 purchased in March of 2000.

I LCD's at the time were still behind the Plasmas with picture quality. I originally wanted a 42\" but went bigger and I am so glad I did.Now lets get down to what you are reading this review for. Once purchased it took about a week for delivery (which for me was way too long but I did have time to find a TV stand). If you are going from a SD TV to a HD TV (as I did) then you will be amazed at the picture quality especially if you are a sports fan. Now SD channels are not that good but are better that a regular TV with 4:3 pull down. Also I switched from Comcast to DirectTV due to the picture quality. Comcast has to use a video compression technique to get HD over the coaixal cable which henders quality.Out of the box I had a low sounding buzzing noise that was intermittent and if I turned the volume up I wouldn't hear it. It kinda bothered me at first but I go over it. After reading some forums alot of people experince this with Plasma it's just to what volume level can you tolerate it. Samsung is aware and have some remedies. Also be aware this TV gets hot and expands the plastic molding which will make a crakling sound from time to time (you will also hear this when you turn the TV off). This issue/concern is addressed in the owners manual. This is just a by product of having a Plasma TV.After adjusting all the available picture settings I was completely satisfied with picture quality. I have a PS3 (HDMI) and XBOX 360 (Component) and both are beautiful to look at. Please be advised that additional adjustments may be neccessary to get the picture the way you want it. I could write more on this but its my vision vs yours. So remember its what you prefer not me. I am just very pleased with the HD and SD picture quality. I highly recommend this TV.I do have to say I do get compliments from others (mostly friends and family) on the picture quality they see on this TV.Now I did have a bit problem that drove me crazy for awhile. Late January 09 I started noticing this rapid pixel flicker of red and green color in dark areas of video content. It only seemed to happen after the TV had been on for awhile (sometimes 30min to 2hrs). I think is was tempeature related. Oh by the way the backt top of the TV gets really hot. So if you have children please be aware of this. Now back to this flickering of pixels you had to be about 3-5 feet away to really see it but after about a month of this I could see it from my standard sitting distance (which is exactly 10ft).  I called Samsung support and even after a year still issued a warranty work order. The tech that came out could see it (that was good to know because my girlfriend said I was obessed with this. Unfortunately the tech just oredered a power supply  board and that realy didn't fix it. So I called Samsung back and they issued another warranty claim and the TV repair shop said we will get you an interior display replacement (which replaces the display and all boards except power supply and input/output board.). So needless to say Samsung support has been GREAT to me.Overall--- Do your own research. Pick the TV that fits your budget and wants. You already know you need a TV. Don't be afraid to go big. Go online to the actual brand manfacturer to determine what the models are (entry level vs premium) and features they come with. Then go to the big retailers to actually see the TV. Do be skeptical of picture quality in the store. They use different settings than what you may use in your home. Remeber where you are putting this TV (pay attention to you surrounding light). Then shop Amazon becuase no sales tax. I would've paid over 1,000 more if I bought at the BB store. Also not every TV is perfect these are highly technical pieces of equipment and all brands have issues (as you will discover when you do your research). Its how they deal with those issues that sets them apart. As I have stated before Samsung has been great to me.Hope this review helped you in making an informed decission.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Product - Horrible Customer Service", "Author": "J.

I'm not really sure how you improve on the picture quality. I'd love to compare it to the $10,000 Pioneer plasmas and see for myself exactly what the difference is. I bought mine through Amazon.com for $1358 and had zero problems with delivery and setup. I was leary about buying a plasma TV through the internet and having it delivered without damage. It was fine.I have a HD cable box hooked up to this TV. Within the range of HD channels, some are better than others in terms of picture quality. It's not the fault of the TV, but rather the signal strength and how the video was originally created. I would say the overall range is from very good to absolutely stunning. Even on SD channels, the quality is good to very good, but not HD quality. Fortunately, there are a lot of HD versions of the most popular channels out there and I would expect more to be added.I also bought a Samsung home theater with the wireless rear speakers and the sound is amazing. Don't rely on the speakers that come with this TV or you will be disappointed. My home theater came with a up converter for DVDs and there the quality ranges from OK to excellent. My DVD copy of \"War of the Worlds\" was pretty disappointing, but \"Pirates of the Carabean: At Worlds End\" was excellent. I have to believe there's a range of quality among DVDs. I believe Blue Ray is the way of the future, but the price of movies is still pretty high compared to DVDs - at least $10 more per movie.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV no regrets", "Author": "Nariman Shariat", "ReviewID": "R2C05BCKRQAYL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV about a year or so ago and I love it.

Picked up the 5084 on the 4th of July and it's a winner.  I saw it next to the Panasonic TH-50PZ800U and the Panasonic 50PZ80U. I set all 3 TVs to movie mode and liked the Samsung better. Here is how I arrived at this decision.1. First I got the plasma vs. lcd choice out of the way by appreciating that plasmas still do better blacks and deeper color. My wife and I watch 90% of time at night. This is where plasmas excel.2. I narrowed down the plasmas to the pioneer 5080, Panasonic 50pz85u, and 50PZ800U.At the time, the Samsung 5084 wasn't even in the running. As I spent time watching the Panasonic 50pz85u I noticed noise in dark scenes even connected with a monster cable and a good line cleaner so I passed. I found that the pioneer even on sale was $600 more than the Samsung. The Panasonic 50PZ800U was $1000 more. Clearly these two TVs are superior with more goodies, but not life changing enough to justify the cost.3. In the end what pushed me to the Samsung was the fact that it's a \"high end TV\" from last year that was $1500.00 less than when it came out. I paid $1570.  I would rather have an older high end TV than an newer low or medium end TV. While I'm at it Id rather pay a low end price for a high end TV.4. This TV is still among the top ten on Cnet almost a year later with the same rating as it's newer 2008 model: PN50A5505. At the writing of this review all knows bugs have been worked out. Another reason to wait on an older high end model.Pluses:I have had the Samsung for a month now and it has performed flawlessly.Good Standard Def picture. Excellent high def. Can't comment on DVD picture because I am running my DVD player through an Onkyo 605 receiver that up converts the picture to 720p and it looks fabulous.My wife loves the bezel (frame). This is what made the whole thing work for her. Plus setting up the room so that it looks like a display room.Minuses:You have to be careful how long you pause a picture as it will retain the image. I created a macro key on my Logitech remote (that a got at Amazon) called safe pause. When I press it, it pauses the picture and turns the TV off. If however you get picture retention, Samsung has excellent tools that act like window washers for your screen.Some times I might watch TV during the day if I am off and the light coming in can be a drawback in dark scenes.  This is easily remedied with $15 window blinds.I am very happy I bought this TV and have no regrets.

The sounds is not all that great, but frankly, if you're going to install a TV this big, make sure you also run the sound through a seperate sound system.

The HD picture is outstanding, all HD channels are just jaw dropping gorgeous and have a depth to the picture that looks like you could put your hand through the set.NO problem with image burn in, I've left the mute button accidently on for like 18 hours (it displays a little mute logo on the screen) more than once and haven't seen any image retention, same for PS3 games (which like another reviewer said are so good looking you've got to watch the cut scenes a few times before you can concentrate on the game).  About the PS3, if you hook it to the TV with HDMI then it becomes a very good UPSCALING DVD player, so good in fact that regular DVD's are darned close to Blu-Ray in appearance.  (Note on Blu-Ray disks: if it is an older movie and hasn't been remastered for Blu-Ray release save your money and get the regular DVD, there is a big picture quality difference between new movies released for blu-ray, those remastered for Blu-Ray and scum eating studios trying to get you to spend more money for a Blu-Ray disk that they don't spend any effort to maximize the picture quality on.  Check out the remastered Blu-Ray versus regular Blu-Ray release of 5th element for takes on this.)I'd like to address some of the \"problems\" pointed out by other reviewers.  First SD channels, \"garbage in, garbage out\", if the original picture is poor/bad then you can't expect a TV to \"fix it\" and make it HD clear.  Anyone who does is like the fool in the copier commercial who wants to have his black and white presentation run on the color copier to spice it up, DUH!  Second complaint, speakers, LOOK AT THE THINGS, they are itty, bitty little speakers in the side of the slim panel why in the world would anyone expect anything close to 5.1 or 7.1 sound???  Use the digital optical out from the TV into your AV sound system this will take the sound from all the devices plugged into the TV and allow you to use just one cable to the AV receiver.One annoyance that went away after a couple of months was a \"crackling\" sound coming from the plastic trim around the set as it warmed up.  I was a bit worried until I figured out it was the plastic trim and after a few months it evidently had expanded to its full size and quit making noise.

Of course its only as going as the material coming in so corral your expectations.  I would still recommend this TV to anyone.There are a couple caveats - 1) its damn heavy and awkward to carry.  Easily 100+lbs so you'll need help moving it anywhere (especially placing on an entertainment center).  2) It puts off some heat.  You get within 6 inches of it and you notice it. 3) The built in speakers are a bit \"thin.\"  They sound OK but not as full as I was expecting.  But they are also rather small so its to be expected.  4)  Mine has a faint buzz while powered on.  Obviously if you're watching something you don't hear it.

I purchased this TV on the Amazon site, but the actual seller was Butterfly Photo.  The price of the product was good, although I think the $200 shipping fee is far too high.  The TV was delivered after setting a time and date to do so, but $200 only gets the TV into the front entry of your home, and not even an extra 20 feet to the family room where I intended to put the TV.  $200 also does not get you your TV unpacked, or the box hauled away.  Nothing.  You get the TV dropped immediately inside your front door and that's it.  So I had to unpack it, get it into the family room by myself, haul away the box (which is enormous, but which also does break down) and wait till someone else came and helped me lift the TV onto the stand.  The set up was easy.The picture was great--for one month.  Then on three consecutive days the picture would go black, all sound would go off, and the power light would come on and off repeatedly.  I wrote to Amazon, which said--\"contact the seller.\"  I contacted the seller which said \"we don't take returns, you need to call Samsung.\"  I called Samsung and they gave me a reference number and a phone number to call for a service dealer.  I called the service dealer which put me on hold for twenty minutes, then disconnected me.  I then called back and the service dealer denied having a reference number for me.  Then they found it.  Finally I spoke with someone who was pleasant and helpful who scheduled an appointment for a service call.  At the appointed time a very nice fellow arrived to fix the tv, opened the box with a new power source in it (which had been shipped by Samsung to the service dealer), and discovered that the box contained the wrong power source.  Another week passed before he was able to come back with the right power source and the TV has been fine for the last three days.This power problem is apparently so common that both the troubleshooting manual and the Samsung web site refer to the symptoms which my TV displayed.  After suggesting such helpful tips as unplugging the TV and letting it sit for a minute before plugging it back in, the final \"tip\" is \"The TV is using its power management system.\"  That's it.  The TV may be using its power management system, but it's using it to go black and lose sound.  There's no description telling you what that means, or how to deal with it.  Instead, you first write to Amazon, then to the seller, then call Samsung, then get hung up on....You get the picture (so to speak.)

I probably just received a bad egg.  I just wanted to provide my review of the Samsung 50\" 1080P plasma.  I want to start off by saying that working with Amazon has been rather nice.  They seem to be prompt and get back to me when they say they will.  Also, I gave this TV 1 star only because I was unlucky enough to be shipped a defective TV.  I will certainly update this review if/when I receive one that is fully functional.  As for the Eagle delivery service.  My experince was great I must say.  Two guys delivered my TV and they carried my TV up three flights of stairs, unpackaged it and even hooked it up for me.  They also turned it on and we chatted about my apartment for a bit.  They liked it.  :)They also took the box with them.  I had no problems at all.  P.S. I live in Boston.  Now comes the bad part.....dum...dum....dum....  I was shipped a defective panel.  Let me start by saying that I know alot about electronics and TV's in particular and I hooked this thing up perfectly.  The TV had issues starting.  When the Eagle guys turned it on, it worked fine for about 5 minutes while they were there (of course!).  God forbid anything should go wrong while they are still there!!!!  It then turned off and on and off and on and I could hear a hissing or screeching sound coming from the back of the TV.  The picture would get blochy and the TV would continue to try and restart itself.  After about 4-6 attempts, it gives up and doesn't bother turning on at all.  Now, I was able to get it going for like 6 hours on day one.  Oddly enough, if it is able to make it through the first 15 minutes or so after turning on, it seems to work fine. When it gets going, I must say that the picture is INSANE.  I watched the Planet Earth HD DVD through my X Box 360 (HDMI) and I was blown away.  Amazing.  Gears of war was ridiculous on this thing!!!  Because of the dreaded \"burn in\" fear though, I hadn't planned on playing any video games on it for quite a while.  Not that it matters now though, as I can't turn the darn thing on.  It seems to have issues making it through 5 minutes of viewing.  If it gets through about 15 minutes, then it seems fine....ODD.  Definitely defective though.I tried contacting Samsung to see if I was doing anything wrong or if they had heard of this problem before.  The Samsung Tech told me that he wasn't sure what was wrong and that the TV is defective.  P.S:  I think the guy knew less about TV's than I do!
