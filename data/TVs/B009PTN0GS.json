Got the TV delivered 20 min ago. Here's my short but VERIFIED review:1. TV has 0 branding on the front. I could slap a Samsung sticker on it if I wanted to.2. The TV actually has the power outlet pointed downwards which I wondered why my last 5 TV's decided to still have it pointing out the back.3. The remote looks bad but works. Who cares.4. The sound isn't that bad like everyone complains about. No vibration like someone else said. Plus, anyone who buys a 40\"+ tv and plans on using built in sound vs a home theater is crazy. Unless it's a tv that is going in a play room.5. Picture looks fine to me.6. The stand seems sturdy, the screws that go into it though strip easy so be careful =)7. HDMI inputs are on the side of the tv and are tight. Meaning, a normal HDMI head fits flush up against the tv. So if you have a cable with the big black ferrite connector close to the top, it's going to be tight.8. The TV's interface menu is quick and is laid out well if that matters.For my first off brand tv, this was a steal and I am very happy with it.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bought as a secondary TV, but was surprised to decide.....", "Author": "hangman", "ReviewID": "R1RZGOT6MB71N3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV with the thought that I would make it my secondary TV.  I have a 42\" Panasonic Plasma (4 years old) in the living room, still so much better of a picture than most of the LCD's.  So I was surprised when I turned it on expecting lots of motion blur because of it's 60Hz refresh and watching NFL it was not an issue, then watching some basketball again no problems, then golf again no problems.  So I switched to other non sports programs again good picture.  Keep in mind I still feel that the picture quality and colors are better on my plasma but it was far better than expected.  Being that my plasma is in a room with 7 windows it gets lots of glare so for the time being I've decided to move the plasma to a secondary room and make this 50\" my main TV.I have a nice surround sound set up so I never bothered turning on the TV to listen.  I would probably say it sucks but that's just because I've yet to hear a thin TV have good sound.  Thus I have surround sound.The only complaint I have is that the bolts on the back for wall mounting appear to be insufficient, but it will hold fine I just would have liked to see something a little bigger.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic for the price.", "Author": "Aaron W.

I love the fact that it doesn't have a logo on the front, it's just nice and sleek looking.  Also, like some other reviewers have stated, the picture quality is superb.  I haven't noticed any motion blur whatsoever, be it an action movie, comedy, cartoon, etc.  I for one, think that the sound quality of its built in speakers is quite laudable.  Better than my old LCD, by all means!  And, I must again agree with some other reviewers on here in stating this: if you don't like it's audio, you should probably have (or acquire)some decent home theater speakers anyways.  With the money you can save on this unit, why not splurge a little for decent audio?All in all: I would absolutely recommend this TV.  I love the way it looks, the picture quality, the sound, and most of all... the price point!

Ignore the negative reviews!", "Author": "CharlieG", "ReviewID": "RMMYFIFROR5IP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This HDTV is a bargain for $500. As an AMAZON gold box deal at $288, it's a steal!  Please notice that of this date, not a single negative review has \"Amazon verified purchase\" below the title.After installing this HDTV (which has no brand markings on the actual HDTV),I did a side by side comparison with my Samsung 1080P/120Hz HDTV.  After a few adjustments in the easy to navigate windows, the picture on this HDTV looked almost identical to the Samsung. In full 1080P mode, the picture quality was excellent. You will not be disappointed.Sure the best way to listen to a HDTV is through a good sound system, but the speakers in this TV are fine.  No rattles, no muddy sound, just the sound you would expect from a flat screen HDTV (remember there is not much space to mount speakers in a FLAT screen HDTV so don't expect booming bass).This HDTV is easy to set up and connect to cable, DVD, a computer, or other sources.  It has three HDMI ports so connecting multiple source devices is a breeze.  This HDTV does not have an optical connection for sound, but it does have a digital coax output that works fine.  It will easily scan through the cable channels to find all unscrambled analog and HD channels and it finds them all the first time.  It takes several scans for the SAMSUNG to find all the channels.  The FCC requires cable companies to carry the unscrambled HDTV transmissions of all local stations.  The FCC doesn't prevent the cable companies from putting the HD channels in weird locations and moving them around and Charter cable does this frequently. The ability to do a fast auto scan for channels is very helpful.Here is another really amazing aspect of this HDTV. My Samsung remote control also works with this HDTV for most functions such as power, volume control, source/input and the up/down channel functions.The remote control supplied with this HDTV is fine.  It is not cheap and flimsy as the negative reviews have described it.  It doesn't have lighted buttons and the solid feel of expensive remotes, but it works well and is no different then the remotes supplied by many \"brand name\" HDTVs.Bottom line, this HDTV is a bargain at around $500. If you were lucky enough to snag the AMAZON gold box deal, congratulations!Update: (One Year later)  This TV is still working perfectly.  It has become my main TV and it performs flawlessly. The Hiteker remote has one minor issue.  When changing inputs with the remote, it sometimes takes several button presses to change inputs.  New batteries don't solve the problem.  All other remote functions work flawlessly.  The remote from my Samsung HDTV changes the input on the Hiteker so I know it's the remote supplied with the Hiteker. This is not a major issue, just a minor bug in the remote. A great TV and after a year, I am still very satisfied.  I'll update this review in another year.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, but Defective", "Author": "JP Willingham", "ReviewID": "R17EP4RRAITHXZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For $288 this is most definitely worth the money. This TV has great picture and the sound is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. The sound is similar to that of name brand TV's audio, which still doesn't say much.However, the set I received had a quiet buzz or hum when it was on, it had one dead pixel in the top left, and had a dark band going across the middle of the screen that was about 2 inches thick. The first two complaints were not a big enough deal for me to return it, but the dark band running across the screen was noticeable on every color background except black. It was noticeable during videos and you could even see it on the \"No Signal\" screen, so it was not the source's problem.I will be getting a replacement set soon, and I will update the review based upon the new set I receive. If the new set still hums and has a dead pixel but no banding, I would give it 4 maybe 5 stars, because for the price it is well worth it. $400-$500 seems like a fair price for this TV especially if it is your first LCD.UPDATE:I got the replacement extremely fast, as in UPS picked up the old one and the next day I had the new one. Same buzz, still a single dead pixel, and the banding is still there. The band is now on the lower half of the screen as opposed to the upper half/middle. This band is a little less noticeable and I don't feel like going through the hassle of returning it.Regardless, I'm still happy with my purchase as it has a great picture and a great price.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV!!

Set it up in the basement so I could get the Wii out of my living room, and hooked up the old Blu-Ray.  There is only one old-fashioned AV hookup, so if you have a Wii and a VCR, you will need an A/V switch box or some other solution.So far, it's been great.  The remote is simple (I consider this a plus), the connections are great for a wall mounting, and the sound is OK for a flat panel.  The picture doesn't seem as sharp as my other HDTV, but it isn't bad, either.  (I haven't tried playing with the settings yet.)The Wii looks OK, but the VCR looks terribly blocky.  Not the fault of the TV, of course, just a note.The box it came in was in good shape, but it's not a heavy-duty box at all, and only about 5 inches deep, so there is a risk of damage there.  It had the normal 4 blocks of foam at the corners, and a loose piece of 1\" foam in front of the screen itself.  Not much protection for such a big-ticket item.  (My old 55-inch TV came in a huge, thick cardboard crate that was about 18 inches deep.)  But this one was easy for two people to carry, and I had no trouble hefting it up onto the TV stand by myself once it was out of the box.Even at the current price, it is a pretty good deal.

Loveless", "ReviewID": "R10HVVN4D6RVWW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV during the 2012 Black Friday sale for $280, it was one of the best deals I ever got. I have waited a while to write the review because I wanted to see how the TV would hold up. We have used this TV in our living room as our main TV since Dec of 2012 and so far it has been excellent. The picture is sharp on HD channels, We watched the Life of Pi HD Blue Ray not too long ago and it was breath taking on this TV. Colors are rich and bright. Sound is great. I know the sound bar on our TV can go up to like 60 and we usually have it around 19-23 and thats with 4 cats, a parrot, and a 11 year old boy running around the house and you can still hear it just fine and clear when sitting at normal distance from the TV. Watching non-hd channels isnt too bad. When you first switch to a non HD channel you can definitely tell a difference, but after you watch it for a bit its like watching a normal tube TV and you dont notice anymore.We also noticed the TV was set on 780p and we had to manually go in to our cable settings and set it to 1080p. So some of you who arent getting an amazing picture might want to check your cable settings to make sure its on 1080p.As someone else said it has no branding on it, so when all my friends come over they always ask me who made the TV and comment on how nice it is. My one friend who is a major name brand buyer \"has to have all the top of the line name brand items\" is extremely jealous of how nice this tv is and what I paid for it.I had no issues with shipping. It was shipped fast, delivery company called twice to confirm delivery. The delivery guy who came was extremely nice, knowledgeable and helpful. He helped set the tv up exactly where we wanted it and everything.We have use the HDMI port without any problems and attached our laptop to the tv and used it as a monitor without issues, and its pretty awesome as a monitor! The HDMI slot was fine and not too close to other slots, we dont have the issue of it scraping the case when we insert the HDMI cable on it.The only downside I had was the remote kinda sucked, but we had a universal remote from comcast so we didnt need the remote that came with it anyway.All in all if they go on sale again this Black Friday 2013 for $280 or less Im going to buy another one if I can.

I love the three HDMI ports, and all the ports are easy to reach and seem solidly built.

Here's the thing, I had a huge party planned and and had to cancel. We ended up having it at another friends place so all worked out OK.

For the Black Friday (actually Thurs) lightening deal price of $288, I certainly did not go wrong and I'm even of the mind to say that I would likely have been as pleased if I had purchased this set under the current price, albeit much lighter in the wallet.This set is what it is said to be and does what it is suppose to do beyond my expectations. The picture quality is very clear and the colors, rich. And while it only has a 60Hz refresh rate, I am not finding any issues whatsoever with the fast images on the golf and football games that I have watched (except that the Lions lost yet again : (The sound quality does not have the depth that I'd prefer from it's rear-facing speakers (a common complaint w/ thin flat screens), but with a bit of adjusting under the audio settings, it is very comfortable to listen to and therefore not a big issue at all for me. I'm betting that an external speaker would make a noticeable difference but doubt that I will even bother.  I have absolutely no issue with the set's volume, either, finding it plenty loud enough even at less than the 25% level (w/great range to spare when the grandkids are over ;).The settings menu for picture, sound, channel, parental control, setup and 'others' is very easy to access and use.My biggest issue with this set (which won't be for cable users) is that I cannot, for some reason, pick up the local PBS channel (actually 3) via our roof-top antenna despite multiple channel scannings. I get it clearly on two other sets that are similarly connected, so the problem seems to be with this TV. I don't understand that lacking and cannot figure a way/setting to enable this specific reception. Frustrating.A very minor bother (almost not worth mentioning) is the set's clock. I cannot find a way to change it from military time to 12-hour. Obviously not a big deal, but it would be nice to have the option.The aesthetic quality of the set is quite nice, the narrow glossy frame (sans branding), the stand (sturdy and secure), etc, are basic in black so not worth expanding on. The variety of ports, as detailed in a previous reviewer's post, will more than cover my needs. They are located on the back/left and are side facing for easy access. The set's manual controls are located on the right side, convenient for walk-by shut-offs or volume changes, as I have it positioned.As for the remote control, while not the most attractive in design, I find it solid enough in the hand and user friendly.  From early searching, it seems that a replacement/spare controller may not be available and that a useable code for a programmable/universal remote might prove difficult/impossible to find. (although one reviewer suggested that a 'Curtis Mathis' code might work *shrug*). Should anyone find such a controller with a working code please share.Just to add, delivery of this item was Amazon at their best. Under their white-glove treatment, it was was shipped and delivered by CEVA, brought in the house, unboxed, assembled and set up, with the packaging gathered up and trucked off after our inspection and satisfaction that all was well.  This was my first time ordering such a large item online and much to my pleasure, Amazon's care made it painless!I recommend this TV set, even at today's price.

I hadn't realized Amazon provided 'white glove' delivery (unboxing, setup / confirm operation / remove & dispose packaging).  That's a SUBSTANTIAL added value Amazon provides, evidently standard on TV purchases 48\" and up sold/shipped by them (ask around - a lot of companies will charge $100+ just for that)!The TV won't win any beauty pageants for its construction aesthetics, but as much as that would be nice, I bought it for the display.  As such, it is actually quite good.  The resolution of one 1080p set is the same as another, so differences will be discernable only in matters of color accuracy, brightness, black level, contrast, angle of viewing, etc.  As it stood on it's own in my home, I was quite pleased with all of these (though black level might have been a bit truer).  Of course, it's very easy to see differences in TV's in a store side-by-side, but the truth is, you generally won't appreciate the difference much when it's on its own.  That isn't to say one set won't have a better image, but the fact remains that you really can't find a *bad* looking HDTV.The sound is, as others have mentioned, far from extraordinary.  It is however audible and clear enough - just don't expect to feel like you're aurally in the image.  For film or sports (anything you want to generate some excitement), get a soundbar or hook it up to your stereo, as you should with any TV regardless.The set doesn't have a myriad variety of connections, but what it has will suffice for most systems.  I actually tried connecting my PC to it via HDMI, and found that it worked surprisingly well.  The HDMI connections are side-mounted, and set fairly close to the back of the TV.  The cables I used fit, but just barely, so if you have a 'beefy' connector you might have an issue.  Of course, investing in 'uber high-end' HDMI cables is pointless as over HDMI you either get the unaltered signal or you don't (you're not going to get 'noise' in the line), but that's a topic for another discussion.The on-screen GUI is nothing to swoon over but it does get the job done.The remote is the only aspect of this TV that is truly 'cheap' in feel and construction.  I honestly think that within a month of moderate use some of the buttons will simply fall off. That, and the included AAA batteries were dead.  Fortunately, this remote is easily replaceable with any programmable or all-in-one remote.I'm going to continue to afford it a 5-star rating for now despite the remote, which when weighed against the Black Friday pricing it easily deserves.  Against normal pricing, it would probably still warrant 4-stars (as of now) if it weren't for the remote.  But when you get above the ridiculously cheap pricing range, a decent remote is really mandatory.----------------------------------------------------***ORIGINAL COMMENTS (11-22-12)***As to the picture, I won't waste your time detailing how and I'm more concerned with  So I'm putting this review in with preliminary thoughts now and as a placeholder for further detail upon my receipt and evaluation.First, a caveat:  Reviews that are not tagged \"Amazon Verified Purchase\" should be taken with about a seriously large tablespoon of salt as, especially at this time, there is a lot of 'sour grapes' commentary.  This isn't to say that they can't be accurate, but it's a pretty safe bet that given there were NO reviews posted prior the lightning deal, it seems pretty suspect that an owner would suddenly feel the need to post something about it in the first couple of hours after the sale (of a product they've allegedly had for some time) was conducted. Product reviews should be just that: product reviews.  Not a review of the sales process/experience, or availability.  For now I have given this product 5 stars as, with no other information, it is a tremendous value for the price at which I purchased it.  I expect I may end up lowering my evaluation upon receipt (scheduled for this coming Tuesday) based on construction, available connections, true contrast, color accuracy, remote, manual, ease of setup, menu operation, panel quality (any bad pixels), viewing angle, etc - though I hope it warrants maintaining a good rating.At 50\" and full HD (1080P), this is most likely an amazing deal at the lightning deal price. Since that deal is done, anyone considering this set should wait for more information before investing the 'normal' price.As an aside, to those commenting on the listed contrast ratio, it warrants noting that there is no industry standard or regulated procedure for determining a display's contrast ratio, i.e. it is pretty much a worthless stat (i.e., a TV with 4,000:1 might actually provide greater contrast than one with a 20,000:1 ratio, or worse contrast than one with a 2,000:1 ratio).More details to come next week...---------------------Edit to provide more technical details about this model as garnered from another website:*  50\" LCD panel with a 1920 x 1080 Full HD resolution*  True 16:9 aspect ratio*  View your movies as the director intended on the 1080p 60Hz LCD HDTV*  Wide 176-degree vertical and 176-degree horizontal angles*  See a clear picture from anywhere in the room*  The flat screen LCD TV features a built-in digital tuner*  Watch digital broadcasts, including HDTV programs where available*  High brightness of 350 cd/m2 and 8.5 ms response time*  Quick response time for a great picture*  40,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio*  HDMI Inputs: 3*  Enjoy a superior HD experience with HDMI one cable solution*  50\" screen measured diagonally from corner to corner*  ENERGY STAR\u00aeBrightness:  350cd/m2Contrast Ratio:  40,000:1Remote Included: YesResolution:  1080p (HDTV)Response Time:  8.5 msTv Definition:  HDTVTv Technology:  LCDPrimary Color:  BlackModel No.: TL50Z10AH-TPShipping Weight (in pounds):  75.0Shipping Dimensions:  46.0 x 11.0 x 31.4", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy Thanksgiving!", "Author": "gabriel", "ReviewID": "R2MI89Z99XNOHW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has an average of fours stars on Walmart.
