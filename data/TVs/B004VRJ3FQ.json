The picture is great. 720p on a small screen looks like true HD.  But, we can't get past the terrible audio.  As a thin flat panel TV, the speakers are very small and fire down from the bottom of the TV.  There are no lower frequencies to speak of because of the nanometer sized speakers, regardless of the sound mode selected or the equalizer settings.  So the sound is very brassy.  Using the stand and sitting the TV on a hard surface, makes the high frequencies so brassy, the set is practically unlistenable.  We have the set sitting on a towel - which helps a little.  But we're very disappointed.  We're looking at using a small sound bar but we're saddened at the idea that we have to go to this additional expense to compensate for this deficiency.  If you're planning to simply use this TV for video and using another method for audio, the set is a great buy and I'd recommend it.  If you're planning to use the TV's speakers for audio, I suggest you look elsewhere.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "audio", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R2OKBVK1KFFY6B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "yes the sound is bad.

After proper burial rites, we researched all the new small televisions that would fit into our kitchen.  We first brought home a Samsung 19-inch LED TV (UN19D4003) because Consumer Reports said it had the best picture in its class.  It was rated at the top along with Toshiba.  Its sound was muffled, low volume and incomprehensible.  The speakers face backwards, towards the wall.  The Samsung was immediately returned to the store.  We needed good auditory qualities in a noisy kitchen.Next we listened to a side-by-side comparison of Insignia's 19-inch LED TV(NS-19E320A13) with Toshiba's 19-inch LED TV (19L4200U).  The Toshiba was by far louder and clearer with larger amplifiers.  The Toshiba's picture has less glare than the Samsung, easier on the eyes.  Toshiba has the Dynalight backlight.  We bought the Toshiba.The only drawback is the need for two remotes.  Our DIRECTV remote is needed to change channels, and the volume control is on the Toshiba remote.Update 9/20/12:  Remote control problem solved.  A telephone call to technical support got us through the steps of synchronizing the DirecTV remote with the new Toshiba television.

So I decided to find a new tv.I wanted something that would fit in the space I had, about 24 inches were available, and it had to have a good picture since I would use it for gaming, as well has being with in my budget. Looked around at all the stores in my area and nothing really fit the bill. So I came here to look around, found a few others that looked like they would work, but this is the one that I liked best.It came quickly, and I had it set up(almost) completly after opening it. The only thing that I didn't know about was that it had a built in scanner, or whatever it's called that allows you to pick up the channels if you don't have cable or satlilite. I had a converter box before, and so I had it set up with the box, and the TV wouldn't pick up any channels. My dad is the one that figured out that I didn't need the box and now I get more channels that I didn't before with my old tv and the box. So that's a plus.Pros:Great pictureGreat soundI got it at a great price!Easy set upEasy to get from TV to Gameing channels.Size is just right for meCons:That they didn't say that it had a built in analog signal detector thing.

LED do have the problem that one needs to view video directly in front to have best quality (if you view from side or above or below the video is poor (especially color).
