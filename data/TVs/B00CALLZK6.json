I measured a contrast ratio of 10,400:1 which is really excellent!The back-light scanning (labeled LED Clear Motion) blacks the picture while the LCD pixel is changing state. Further no soap opera effect. Since the LEDs are very bright, they still generate enough light with the Clear Motion feature enabled.Once calibrated the display offers a compelling picture quality. I like it!Many of the menu settings are shared between Standard and Movie mode.

I was able to compare the pictures on the two TVs, and to my eyes, the quality was identical. I also couldn't see that the additional 1\" was worth that extra money, so I bought the 39-inch model. I couldn't be happier.While in the store, I also had the opportunity to compare the pictures on the Samsung sets with other brands such as LG and Sony. I couldn't see any significant difference between them and the Samsungs. My opinion was confirmed for me when the cable guys came to install my cable - they were blown away by how good the picture was, and these are guys who see a LOT of different TVs.This is not a smart TV, but the Blu-ray player I bought 3 months ago has internet connectivity, and I didn't see the need for a smart TV on top of that. My current setup includes a Sony Blu-ray player, an Xfinity cable box, and this Samsung TV, all connected through a Sony HT-CT150 soundbar with subwoofer. Because the soundbar acts as a hub for all audiovisual functions, setup was extremely simple (plug the Blu-ray into the BD HDMI port on the subwoofer, plug the cable box into the SA/CATV HDMI port on the subwoofer, and plug the subwoofer's TV Out HDMI port into the TV's HDMI 1 port).The picture looked great out of the box, because my viewing room is normally pretty bright, and I haven't had to change any of the default settings. I did play around with them just to see what the differences were, but ended up leaving everything where it started.The audio from the built-in speakers is reasonable, but the soundbar/subwoofer combination make a huge difference.I have nothing but positive things to say about Samsung and this particular TV.Edit: there is one negative thing - the USB port is on the back of the set, which makes it a pain to connect or disconnect. More thoughtful design would have put it where access was simple - on the front or on the side. That's not a factor for me at this time, because I use the USB port on my Blu-ray player if I want to go that route.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Gaming TV", "Author": "Cherrio", "ReviewID": "R2ZF20JN3QBCAB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I started researching TVs as I was looking for something for the bedroom and gaming. I considered the positives and negatives between LED and Plasma, size vs. price, name brand vs. off-brand sets, and 60 vs. 120Hz. Finally, I settled on the Samsung UN39FH5000 for a few reasons. These were the screen size, number of positive reviews, and the price point. I am not disappointed with my purchase.I knew right off that I didn't want to go below 40 inches. I have previously used a 32 inch TV for gaming and it felt too small. I like that this TV is cheaper than the 40 inch Samsung, and at 39\" it is close enough to fit my needs. I have the TV set-up in a bedroom and it fills the space nicely. It is large enough for everything I do with it, and while sitting just 6-10 feet away, it doesn't feel overly big. For the size, the TV is light weight and can easily be picked up and moved by 1 person. Due to its overall size, attaching the stand might be annoying for you. I did it on my own and had to bend oddly to tighten the screws. Once attached the TV feels sturdy, despite its light weight.One complaint I read a lot about for this TV was its poor sound. When asked for specifics, no one elaborated appropriately. So if you have these same concerns then rest assured that the sound is great. The TV is very loud, in my bedroom I keep it around 12-15 for gaming (out of a possible 100), and around 8 while watching TV during the day. At night I sometimes lower the volume to 4 or 6 and I am still able to hear it perfectly. I have no complaints about the levels of volume or my ability to clearly hear the sound coming from the built in speakers. The TV has various sound options (Standard, Music, Movie, Clear Voice, and Amplify). I keep it set on Standard and it works great for both gaming and watching TV. With that said, the built in speakers are not going to give you a surround sound-like experience while gaming or watching movies. I think we all knew that already, which made me very confused why I saw some reviews point this out. It seems commonsense that you are only going to get as good as the TV can give. Expecting something better and then complaining about it, has no place in a logical discussion, let alone a review.A previous review claims to have utilized expensive calibration equipment to pick the best settings for this TV. I have an extremely accurate color definition and am able to pick up subtle shades between colors. To my eyes, the settings found in that review left the screen dull, washed out, and void of the correct color tones. The settings I am currently using (for gaming and regular TV) are the following:Mode: StandardBacklight: 14Contrast: 60Brightness: 55Sharpness: 45Color: 55Tint: 50/50Dynamic Contrast: LowBlack Tone: DarkFlesh Tone: 0Color Space: AutoWhite Balance: 22, 23, 25, 25, 25, 23Gamma: 0Motion Lighting: OffColor Tone: StandardSize: Screen FitDigital Clean View: OffMPEG Noise Filter: AutoHDMI Black Level: LowLED Clear Motion: OffI am not an expert. I do not own any calibration equipment. These are just the settings I have settled with for gaming and cable. My systems are connected via HDMI and these settings currently seem the best for me. So try them, perhaps as a baseline and then make adjustments to fit your needs. Be sure to read the manual as it has descriptions for most of the settings.This TV only has 2 HDMI inputs, and I wish it had more. I like to keep a variety of things connected and only having 2 is really limiting. This may be something to consider if you are just starting to research TV sets. Another small complaint is that the stand does not swivel. This means you better have enough shelf/table space to rotate the TV to fit your needs. Wall mounting is always an option, for those that need it.This is a no frills, basic TV, with basic options. It will get you watching TV, gaming, and enjoying movies for around $100 less than the nearest competitor. This may not be the TV you want for the center of your expensive entertainment system, but for a bedroom and some modern gaming, it works great!", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great picture", "Author": "Mountain Man \"Rough Rider\"", "ReviewID": "R13DJYE81N1J63", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one great TV for the price!

My guess is this is due to a bluish LED backlight.  Huge thanks to the review with the calibration settings.  You can see that he(?) turns the blue way down (in white levels) in addition to warming up the color temp of the display.  I ended up tweaking a bit under the specified levels for blue and a good chunk under green as well.  No calibration disk (yet), just pull up a known cartoon with lots of primary colors and play with those white levels.  I used Mickey Mouse Club House.Its still not perfect.

I wanted a tv for my bedroom and this was a nice option that popped up on slickdeals for 358 shipped so I got it.  I bought a WD Media player thinking I would need one to play all the different file types on my drives.  When the TV came I hooked up the TV and probably 90% of them worked just fine.The picture on this one is fine, I can't notice a ton of difference between this and my D series.  I know its only 60hz versus 240 but everything is filmed for the most part at 24fps and at most 48, so a 60hz refresh isn't a big deal on a non 3D file.

I am not going to get into my settings and too much detail but I will give a little bit of background as to why I bought this TV instead of another.I upgraded from a Sony Bravia 32\" KDL325000 which succumbed to power surge. I wanted to buy the Sony 40\" KDL-40R450A, but this Samsung just seemed better. The Sony 40\" LED is similar to this Samsung model in almost everyway. The only thing that separated the two was the Samsung was cheaper and the base was taller. The Sony 40\" LED I was viewing was very squat and did not have a neck like this model. Since my TV is sitting on an entertainment center, I did not want something that was low and squat.Overall: You can't go wrong with a Samsung. This TV is definitely 100x better than my old LCD.

I don't know if it is where I have it placed or if the sound is way much better but it sounds great! So much so that I had to buy a sound bar for the other TV since I felt guilty about mine. Picture is very good out of the box but some fine tuning is needed as with all of them.

I've had it for about three months now. It took me just as many months to research TVs before I settled on this one. My research was a mix of poring over internet reviews and observing TVs in stores like Best Buy. I decided to go with this one because I liked the picture quality and it was about the size (slightly smaller, but it works in my living room) that I was looking for. I bought it directly from a Best Buy store.So far, I'm pleased with it. When I first plugged it in, I experienced what some other reviewers said about the picture not looking like anything they saw in the store. I finally realized that I didn't have the input set to HDMI. After I did that, I didn't really have to do too much adjusting of the picture settings. I've also learned that part of the quality of the picture is due to your cable/satellite service. I use Verizon Fios, and some channels come in great, and others, sometimes the color is slightly off or it's just not as sharp.Sound-wise, I think it's actually not as bad as mentioned in some of the reviews I found. I was expecting really poor sound based on what I had been reading and was thinking that I would have to buy a separate sound bar. But the sound is decent when I use Fios. However, when I plug my laptop in to play Netflix movies, I noticed then that there are issues with the sound, where I have to keep adjusting the volume because suddenly the background music or sound effects are very loud and are overpowering the dialog.I decided against getting the Smart TV. I've been researching the Roku 3 and some blue ray players, but in the meantime, I've just been hooking up my laptop via an HDMI cable, and that gets the job done for me. The picture is great; the sound is decent, barring what I described above. I have an old Roku player that I could use via the A/V inputs in the back of the television, but I haven't tried it yet, so I can't speak to that picture or sound quality.Picture-wise, it's semi-glossy, but actually does pretty well in my apartment, which is very well-lit by uncurtained windows during the day. At night, I can see the reflections of my living room lamps in it, but it's not distracting like it was with my old box TV.  The only weird think about it is that there's almost like this darkness to the picture. I'm not sure how to describe what I mean. It doesn't affect the color or hide anything in the picture. But it is different than watching something on a box television set.All of the inputs are in the back of the television. I use the stand, which is very sturdy. You have to screw the stand to the set.

Took the base apart carefully and reassembled to see if was an alignment issue but didn't resolve the leaning screen. I have 2 other (more expensive flat-screens - Sony and Samsung) with well designed base/TV interfaces but the base design on this one is overly-complicated - assume to cut costs.

No independent PC input. Only two HDMI ports which is limiting.2  It has a optical out(toslink) which only passes PCM 2.0 stereo from your devices. So if you plug your blur ray and your cable box in with HDMI and use a optical cable to connect the TV to receiver IT WILL NOT BE 5.1Over the air and anything internal would be but since it's not a smart TV that basically means only over the air TVMost Receivers have multiple HMDI inputs and one output.

It's a steal at this price and when you register on Samsung they give you an extra 3 months of warranty for a total of 15 months in home service. I extended mine with Square Trade.

The noise was obviously not from the audio since it was present even on mute and the tone could be changed (also the loudness increased  or reduced) by adjusting the backlight. There was also a strong odor of plastic as if some component was overheating. In a quiet bedroom the noise was too annoying to tolerate with the TV muted, and was noticeably present at low volume.  I exchanged the first TV for another of the same model, and while it is significantly quieter and doesn't smell as strongly, the same noise is still present. The noise has gotten slightly louder over the last few weeks, but since the return period is up and we like the TV otherwise, we'll keep it and hope that it doesn't get much louder.  Other than the annoying sound, we like most things about the TV; The picture is very good, although not quite as good as our 40\" Sony. It is brighter though, and can be otherwise adjusted to taste. The remote is one of the better ones I've used, fairly logically laid out and comfortable to hold. While I don't particularly like shiny black plastic, the stand and bezel are pretty unobtrusive. The sound is serviceable - I found the standard setting with the surround sound turned on is clear and pleasant. The menu system is about average, irritating in some areas and intuitive in others. I'm annoyed that there is no dedicated favorite channel button on the remote, and the channel list button cannot be set to default to the favorites. It would be nice if manufacturers spent more time thinking through menus and remotes, and maybe actually used them for a while. The HDMI and USB connections all point straight out near the middle of the back, good for bunching the cables together, but for wall hanging cables or adapters with 90 degree ends may be required.  If not for the noisy backlight, I'd give the TV a solid 4 stars and feel that it was a very good value in a lower end set. However, the noise is unacceptable at any price level and seems to me to be a quality control failure and probably part of the general race to the bottom in terms of using low end components.  I'd recommend that anyone who is sensitive to sound not buy this set for use in a quiet room. The noise in the second one we bought would probably not be an issue in an area of average background sound, but I can't see any good reason a TV should make any sound at all when on mute.

This is the perfect size so I couldn't see spending extra to get a 40 inch when 39 looks good to me. I didn't need a smart tv because my husband is a gamer and we have internet through the xbox so again this was perfect.  Let me say first off the picture is gorgeous. It was easy to set up right out of the box even for someone like me who has never had a digital tv or seen these types of connections before. The on screen menu made it easy and it basically set itself up. When it was done I connected both the xbox 360 and the wii to it with no problems. That was good because the owners manual leaves a lot to be desired and the sections written in English are not grammatically correct. When streaming netflix in HD the picture is incredible.

I have this TV as well as another Samsung in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. The only drawback with this TV it's not a smart TV and you would need to use a WiFi router like Google TV or Roku to get it to connect to the internet. This is why I gave this TV 4 stars instead of 5. But if this is not an issue than this TV would be a smart purchase.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step when looking for TV's is what features come with it. I have listed a few for you here:- This Samsung comes with a technology called Clear Motion Rate (CMR). CMR can depict fast-moving images with sharp detail and vivid contrast while eliminating image distortion.- This TV also comes with Wide Color Enhancer Plus (WCEP). WCEP allows you to witness the entire RGB spectrum on your screen to bring.- The final feature that I thought was a good add-on that comes with this TV is ConnectShare. ConnectShare lets you watch videos, play music, or view photos from a USB connection without needing to use a PC or special equipment. Simply plug your USB device or drive directly into your Samsung TV's USB port and watch on the big screen with friends and family (Here is how you could get around user wireless router for this TV). You can put movies or other content onto a thumbdrive you push it on to the TV directly.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like the picture, but the audio .....", "Author": "H.

On talking voice material it is fine, but music like piano pieces with sustained lower to middle range notes cause and horrible buzzing even at low volumes.  The speakers are buzzing and the flimsy plastic back panel also buzzes!  This TV is in a bedroom and I do not want to invest in a sound bar or external audio devices.  I am not expecting home theater type sound, but just clean sound with no buzzing.Update - Gave Samsung a chance to fix the sound issue. First support person told me to buy a sound bar!  I asked for his supervisor and got him to agree to send out someone to look at the issue.  Service tech told me he has seen sound issues many times with these slim designs and assured me he could fix it with a swap of the speakers (not really needed - he said this) as well as some felt strips on the cabinet.  Well it did NOTHING.  Same buzzing.Watching him I could immediately see what was doing all the buzzing.  It is the large metal back over the display module.  Tapping it with my finger produced the sound I am hearing from the TV.  The speakers are attached directly to the back of the this metal cover.  What is needed are some foam dampers on the LCD back. As an Electronic Engineer that works in the sound industry (Fender guitar amps) I suggested he try and install some thick foam between the plastic flimsy back and the metal LCD back, but he did not want to do this as his allotted service time was used up.  The fix would be so simple.  Amazing to me that Samsung lets this design get out in the field.  I guess they figure most will use the set with an external sound system.  I feel the device should give reasonable sound without external systems.I could fix it myself, but it bugs me to spend money on a product that has issues.

Yeah, that's right. I still mostly watch the primetime shows on the broadcast networks, and I'll admit it.I don't play video games. I don't watch epic movies, expecting to be enveloped into a new reality with a tiny screen. I don't watch football games, expecting to be transported onto the field. I mostly watch sitcoms, and an occasional \"reality\" show or scripted drama. And I'm normally doing other things, like writing this review, at the same time.I want a TV that won't need to be replaced in two years, but I don't want to spend a fortune, either. My research, including talking to a TV repair person, said that while no one can predict the future, there are a lot of brands on the list that I was told to avoid. Samsung was on the short list of reliable brands.So wanting a TV in the upper 30-inches or lower 40-inches, I was drawn to this model by its price point, and other reviews.From straight on, the picture is really great. I really love it. From a really sharp angle, it is more washed-out than I expected, but I'm also talking about an angle that I'd never really watch from, but rather just what I see as I'm coming into the room.I thought set-up was easy. Scanning the cable took longer than I expected, and while the second step of eliminating scrambled channels took nearly as long, I had to do that manually with my old set. I also appreciate that you can set the channel-up/channel-down buttons to just go up and down on those channels you mark as favorites.The biggest downfall of this set is the sound is crappy. I don't have a home theater system in this room. My old set sounded like a good bookshelf system. I would compare this TV's sound to that of a cheap clock-radio. I don't need a lot, but I'm very seriously considering a sound bar because the sound on this set is so bad.I'm giving this set 4-stars based just on the sound. That's how bad the sound is.

The JVC had an excellent picture, and the DirecTV installer (and other people since) commented on the fabulous picture. The TV repairman said it wouldn't be worth repairing the JVC because a new 39\" could be had for around the same price, and I thought that with several years of new technology, any new 1080p set should look at least as good as my old one, so after weeks of reading reviews I grabbed this set from another retailer. I got it for a great price. But when I got it home, I was quite disappointed in the picture. Everything looks flat, the picture isn't sharp, and natural light coming through windows (in the film or show, not my windows) dramatically washes out the entire scene. I tried calibrating according to the instructions of another reviewer, and it improved the picture substantially, but it's still nowhere near as nice as my old JVC. The JVC's speakers were also a bit better, but the Samsung's are acceptable.Update after owning a few months: Since posting my original review, I've calibrated the set using the following free tool, which includes test patterns and a manual:[...]I was immediately much happier with the resulting picture. I still think that the JVC had a better picture overall, but I'm now used to and comfortable with my purchase of the Samsung set. I think it provides a decent picture for the money.

This review is of the 39 inch model. I did a lot of research and at the time this was by far the highest quality and best value at this price point and size. It's not a smart tv but most smart tv's apps are hard to use and poorly implemented besides I have an xbox and chromecast so I don't care about it being a dum TV.Picture: super bright amazing image quality for the price point this tv will not disappoint! Extremely customizable image settings allow you to adjust the picture just how you want it. A quick google search will yield settings that work well but I had to fiddle with the backlighting and black levels to get it how I thought looked best.Sound: other reviews say sound sucks on this tv. The sound is actually quite good as long as it's not mounted to the wall. When wall mounted or pushed up against the wall the sound sounds tinny like how your cellphone speaker sounds when placed speaker down on a table. When the tv is on a tv stand one foot from the wall it has great, clear very loud sound that is more than adequate for my use. That being said a external subwoofer and/or sound bar would be advisable for anyone who likes a lot of extra \"BASS\"I love the power button on this tv! It is a small joystick located on bottom right of TV. It gives you easy access to the settings and menus in a easy to use and intuitive design.

Really dark blacks, amazing video contrast. The blacks are very, very black. The TV show 'Archer' has a black outline around all of the characters and gives a lot of visual contrast, it really shows off the contrast. I use mine with a Chromecast and power the chromecast using the USB port on the back. If you set the name of one of the inputs to \"PC\" it will let you use it as a PC monitor without any \"tv image post-processing\"Dimensions of my unit (as measured by me and my measuring tape) are 35.5x21x3.8\" without the stand. Screen (not including bezel) measured by me is 38.5\" diagonal, 19x33\" vertical/horizonal.The remote has a backlight function - nice! It seems to be compatible with my other, larger Samsung TV remotes from 2010 (this TV bought 2014).This is about the right size TV if you have a small/medium size apartment and only watch TV some of the time. I sit about 10' away (center of screen to eyeballs) from the TV and it's perfect for watching sitcoms, netflix or the occasional movie. If you watch a lot of movies or TV is really important to you you should probably look for something bigger, like a 46\" TV. If I watched more than one movie a week I would definitely consider getting a bigger TV, but if you only watch netflix and don't want to be \"that guy\" who doesn't own a TV, this is a quality set that won't take up too much space but still provides a quality viewing experience when you do turn it on.Also - only uses 47 watts! That's less than a traditional lamp. Screen is very bright, default setting is 12/15, I have it sitting in front of two large windows and it's very bright. Turning it up to 15/15 is even brighter, but at 12/15 it's already brighter than most TVs, 15/15 is kind of obnoxiously bright, especially in a dark room.My roommate declared \"you can get a lot more TV for less if you go with a cheaper brand like Vizio\" and he's right -- but the colors would have been awful. I've bought three flatscreen displays from Samsung previously and I've always been very impressed with the quality. This was no difference. When we plugged it in and watched some 1080i broadcast TV he retracted his previous statement and said \"That's actually some quality glass, I'm impressed\"Sound is about average, highs/mids are well represented, nothing to phone home about. Bass is... well it's there but you couldn't start a dance party with it. I have a Samsung HW-E450 soundbar in the mail to fix the audio. It's not *bad* but if you chromecast a youtube music video it's possible to hear bass distortion at medium volume (50/100) sometimes (in particular M82's song 'outro'). For comparison I usually listen to sitcoms at about 18-24/100. Think of the built in speakers as an 'emergency backup' if you watch anything other than sitcoms/adult swim on this thing.Only 2 HDMI ports, which is pretty low rent in 2014. Since everything from TV tuners to video game consoles to even cell phones and tablets (search for \"MHL adapter\") I already have both HDMI ports in use (#1 for Chromecast, #2 for a 15' HDMI cable to my laptop) so if I ever need a third device I will have to buy a $10 autoswitch... which isn't the end of the world but now I have to deal with a second remote specifically to change my video source.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Welcome to 2014!", "Author": "sanntay", "ReviewID": "RZ7UIP68WA9TA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I finally replaced my huge Toshiba CRT 32\" TV, which I've had since I moved into my place 11 years ago.

They packed it so superbly I can't even believe it!  1st it was in the factory sealed Samsung box, inside a much larger box.  But, that box was not a regular box...it was double thick! Yes, instead of standard corrugated cardboard, it was double thick everywhere!  Super beefy.  The factory Samsung box was placed inside with about 3-4\" of bubble wrap around the ENTIRE factory box!  I bet there was 5\" on the bottom!  Literally the whole TV was encased in layers upon layers of bubble wrap.

I mostly view over the air channels (NBC, CBS, FOX, PBS etc. - which used to be flawless on the old sammy 720p) - so probably since this is a 1080 p set, I need to somehow change the setting on the TV to say, the source is 1080i or 720p or even 480i in some cases...2. the firmware version has been upgraded compared to what was listed on comsumerreports site.

However, with one purchase my fidelity to this company has been cast into serious doubt by their non-documentation of a feature-breaking optical out limitation and their complete refusal to acknowledge their mistake or resolve this issue for me.I bought this TV for two reasons: 1080p and the device manual's claims that, \"The SPDIF...outputs an uncompressed digital audio signal...to a digital audio in jack on a receiver or home theater,\" and, \"By connecting the TV to a receiver or home theater with Dolby Digital and 5.1ch speakers and selecting Dolby Digital, you can maximize your interactive 3D sound experience.\"NONE OF THAT IS TRUE!!! Though the above statements are quoted directly from the manual, the device ONLY outputs 2ch PCM over its optical out for HDMI, Component, and Composite sources, regardless of the original input bitstream (5.1 channels of PCM, Dolby, or DTS). This feature-breaking limitation of the device's optical out is NOT disclosed ANYWHERE on Samsung's website specs or manual, and is acknowledged only in a SINGLE troubleshooting document which must be deliberately searched for and is intended to be used by those who have ALREADY purchased the device. And after speaking with Samsung support at length, it appears that MOST or ALL Samsung televisions are affected by this optical out limitation, and NONE of them have it properly documented (on samsung.com or within the minority of manuals I spot checked).I've contacted Samsung multiple times regarding this issue: most of their support agents are not aware of this limitation or have simply blamed me for not setting up my other equipment properly. It's not until 20-30 minutes with a support agent that they finally understand the problem, but are still of no help whatsoever:* I've asked how I was to know of this limitation before purchase: no one can tell me.* I've asked how to identify a replacement Samsung TV without this optical out limitation: no one seems to know how.* I've asked why this issue isn't documented on their site or, more importantly, the device's manual: no one can tell me why.* I've asked what Samsung is willing to do to rectify this issue: no one seems to care.After six hours on the phone with Samsung's tech \"support\", I sat down and penned a formal letter to Samsung corporate byway of the office of their president. I sent that on Sunday via email, and it's now Friday and I have heard nothing from corporate, not even a confirmation that my letter was received. In fact, I had to call their support services AGAIN just to find out if they had even received my letter.Samsung's support agents have blamed my receiver, my cables, my HDMI devices, even my own competency... they defer the blame to everyone EXCEPT Samsung. And now they don't even see fit to respond in a timely fashion to a formal letter sent to the office of their president. Unless I'm provided a competent and expedient solution by Samsung, my allegiance to the company will be severed permanently.(PLEASE NOTE: In contrast to Samsung, Amazon has been nothing but contrite and apologetic about an issue they didn't even cause, even going so far as to offer me a discount on a replacement device.
