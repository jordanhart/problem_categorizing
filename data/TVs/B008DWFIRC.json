The shipper broke it twice. Don't listen to that review and pass negative judgment on this Tv. I've used it before and it is amazing. I bought another for a friend that i'm building a system for. It is perfect to game on and to watch movies on. The picture pared with a graphics card through the DVI is beyond me. You can never go wrong with Samsung.UPDATE: Oh, never mind the other review that I was talking about mysteriously disappeared.Here is a review from NewEgg that can better reassure you.Pros: If you want a 40\" monitor for a PC, this makes for a great option over using a standard HDTV. Since it is designed with use for a computer display, it uses 4:4:4 subsampling, which is important for viewing text. Most conventional TVs that exist now can't display in this format, and will give you shadowing around text. Even though it is sold as a monitor, it has a built in receiver, which could be a nice bonus. I've used the unit as a monitor & for TV viewing, and both look excellent. Fantastic black levels as well. The monitor uses LED backlighting, as opposed to the edge-lit, <2\" thin TVs that are common nowadays. I might even dare to say that out of the box, the picture is better than my 25\" Asus that I use as my primary screen. The thin bezel looks sharp as well.Cons: While the bezel is nice an thin, the display is somewhat thick by todays standards. Also, the HDMI inputs on the back of the unit face outwards on the back panel, instead of a vertical-style jack. The panel the jacks sit on is a bit recessed, so it doesn't cause much of an issue for wall mounting.Other Thoughts: If you are thinking of buying a large display to use a computer monitor, this is a great option. You can save a bit of money buying an HDTV and get a nice thin panel, but you likely won't be able to get the same picture quality you would find in this.Unfortunately, the person that left that review, did it anonymously. So I can't say thank you.So, there you go.
