As far as picture quality goes, it's good for being a budget tv. Nothing really to complain about with it.However, the major complaint is that the base assembly of the television was manufactured improperly. I purchased the first unit and assembled it, sat it on the stand (which is level) and the television is not level at all. The left side sits nearly 1 inch lower than the right. Over a 50 inch tv that's pretty big time. I returned the intial tv and swapped it out with a new one and it has the same problem. I've disassembled it multiple times and reassembled it to no avail. Everything is put together exacly how it's supposed to be.I've called and talked to customer support twice. The first guy said he would send out a replacement base assembly but failed to give me a case number. When calling back I talked to a woman who said her call center supercedes the previous and that he can't send me out a new one. She also told me I would have to wait a day to hear from a technician. I'll wait it out and see what he says but the thing may be getting returned.I would supposed that if you're planning on hanging this you woundn't have any problems.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad product, bad customer service", "Author": "clipper", "ReviewID": "RR7F6WBR5MT1D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this at a box store, and out of the box half the inputs didn't work. Would have taken it back but it had been discontinued, so hung on to it for 2 months. At the 2 month mark it started shutting off intermittently. At 3 months no picture, but plenty of sound. Sent it back and was told they did not have parts to fix it and I would be sent a different model.New one arrived today after 3+ weeks of waiting. Same model. Plugged it in, powered it up, and after 5 minutes.... No picture. So far I am out the shipping charge, packaging costs, and it looks like I am probably out the cost of the tv. Stay away from this one, it isn't worth the headache.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Great Price", "Author": "Damon Vasquez", "ReviewID": "R1K3JWBDUURWBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first purchase of a 120 hertz  1080 HDTV and it was worth the purchase.
