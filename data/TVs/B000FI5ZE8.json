The first time one connects a TV, one MUST go through the settings with on-screen instructions - very easy.  However, if it's not done correctly, then you may have a `bad' picture, dropping, etc.  Those are also easy to correct, if you know how to operate the settings.Colors are great, love my HD channels - wouldn't trade for anything.  My TV is almost 20hrs a day on, so I know what I'm talking about.If someone is in doubt, a warranty a must.  I love it and recommend to anyone.", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Love this plasma", "Author": "Alexandra", "ReviewID": "R28RKLV29W4KEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the other person's review and thought since I own one why not post one as well.  I got this TV about a year ago at a low price and it gives me no problems what so ever.  I had a smaller Philips plasma TV and decided it was time for a bigger TV.  It works great the colors are amazing.  Before I bought it I made sure it worked and was returnable, and since it come with a 2 year warranty I had nothing to worry about.I suggest if you are buying this baby, buy a warranty so what happened to the other person won't happen to you.", "Date": "March 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "OK while it lasted", "Author": "Bill Wegner \"billwegner\"", "ReviewID": "R2F12QHEPKJ685", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It died within one week of purchase.

I bought it expecting to return it for some reason. I ended up liking this TV allot. The picture quality and the color is outstanding, especially for the price. Put it this way, I was going to get a $1200 32 inch Samsung LCD HDTV, and in my opinion, the color and quality are both better with this TV. This TV is also BIGGER, and Analog (regular TV) looks way better on a Plasma. It also works GREAT with BluRay and my PlayStation 3.The only down side I can think of is that it dosent support 1080p, but it supports 1080i, which is the same resolution without the progressive scan. I cant even really tell the difference.Anyways, I am extremely surprised, and I even got an awesome deal. I also bought the 5 year warranty.", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Warranty only for 90 days", "Author": "Kiran K. Kumar", "ReviewID": "R2A7EY96Z23KPF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV about 1 year back and it has never worked properly after the first month. It started with the TV getting switched off automatically in regular intervals. You had to then manully cut off the power and after resetting it, had to switch it back on. Then came the problem with the Sound. There wouldn't be any sound when you switch on the TV. Resetting the TV by switching off, worked in the initial few months. But then came the worst part, wherein the whole TV will get switched off on it own and a red light on the front would continue to blink. Even resetting the TV wouldn't solve this problem. I bought a refurbished model and Philips gives you only 90 days of warranty of refurbished products. So by the time I saw these issues, the 90 days were over and Philips asked me to gets the TV repaired on my own. On showing the TV to a TV mechanic, they told that it would cost me $750 to get this TV back into working condition. Please don't buy any refurbished or Remanufactured devices from Philips.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Adequate and a great value", "Author": "Adam C.

First one was DOA, but I bought it from Fry's, so what do you expect?Everything is good except the darks.  While the contrast is amazing, as you'd expect from a plasma, the difference between black and the darkest shade of gray is a chasm.  To compensate, the set tries to dither, with predictably bad results.  I think all cheap plamsas suffer from this problem.
