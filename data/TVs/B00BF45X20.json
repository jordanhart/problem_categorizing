Great picture, easy to setup, simple remote, great apps.", "Author": "Casey", "ReviewID": "R2RJZQJWXBCYH1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for exactly a year.  I haven't had any problems with it.  I gave it 4 stars because I think the sound is a little sub par, but if I wan't to listen to something good, I just go optical out into my receiver.  It shouldn't be the deciding factor.  The picture is great, and the netflix menu is also good.  The standard TV menu is also easy to navigate.  The remote is simple and has just what you need and nothing more.  This is a good thing!Most people will want to disable the \"soap opera effect\". To do this, go into picture settings, and turn off motion enhancement.  Then go into film mode and reduce it to 0.  This will make your shows/movies look normal and not like a 1987 episode of Days of our Lives.Understand that 60\" is big.  If you have a small-medium living room, this TV is huge.  You might not be able to see all of it.  It's like sitting in the front row in a movie theater.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "The picture quality is great.", "Author": "DIY_enthusiast", "ReviewID": "R5FBGMBIKTQ6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent picture quality, and delivers as promised feature-wise.
