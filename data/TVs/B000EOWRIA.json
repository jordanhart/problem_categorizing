{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great All Around Flat Panel TV", "Author": "J. Cox", "ReviewID": "R1ZRN5W76UYC7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, regarding the reviewer who is complaining that his TV was made in Mexico. Actually, this is false, they are just assembled in Mexico. The actual LCD is made in a factory jointly owned by Samsung and Sony. I believe the idea that Mexican labor is inferior is a position founded more in racial prejudice than anything else. This isn't Sony Mexico, its just a Sony factory using Mexican labor. Get used to it, Japan and the US arn't assembling electronics anymore---but the engineering is still top notch Sony---and its the engineering that you buy a Sony for.Also, this TV functions properly as a widescreen LCD computer monitor. Before, when I had the el cheapo Polaroid TV, it didn't send the resolution information properly to my IBM ThinkPad. As a result, my computer refused to output a widescreen signal. With this TV, it works great.This TV features a digital diagnostic screen that displays a ton of information about the station. It shows signal to noise ratio, frequency, and a bunch of other technical details you might need to adjust your antenna. Also, I picked up 21 digital stations with this TV, while the Polaroid found only 17. I also didn't have any problems with multipath.This is one of the few HDTVs that includes both a broadcast ATSC tuner and a cable QAM tuner (without decryption from the Cable Card for HBO). The Samsung only has an ATSC tuner. Also, unlike the Samsung, it can recive complete program information and program guide information from digital stations.In comparison to the Samsung, colors are far more natural. Faces and outdoor scenes look as they should. Samsung's DNe processor makes colors look like a cartoon in a side-by-side comparison. However, I realize the casual buyer is just interested in flashy, showy, exaggerated colors.  Also, if you like to tweak color options, the Sony has a lot more than the Samsung.  Black levels are very good. The light sensitive backlight option dims the backlight automatically in dim light. It seems to work pretty well and keeps the black nice and black.Sound quality is pretty good, but who is going to spend over a grand on a TV just to use the internal speakers?? I'm sure anybody buying this TV has a stereo or surround sound system. Actually, the simulated surround sound option sounds pretty awesome.The remote is also very simple, but actually, I really like it that way. I find that menu navigation is a snap. The only thing lacking is an input switch button. Switching inputs is a bit of a pain.Things I don't like about the Sony: Two HDMI inputs would be nice. There isn't any Picture-In-Picture, but in my experience, this is more of a gimmick. One exception, however, would be if you wanted to play a video game and watch a TV program in the corner. Finally, it only has one RF input, so if you want to have cable and broadcast hooked up at the same time, you need to buy an external RF switch, as is described in Sony's manual. That brings the price up $25.Most importaintly, motion blur seems to be a problem with this screen. Amazon's description essentially implies there is none. However, motion blur is quite noticable with rapid motion in video games or even HDTV programs. In fact, it seems worse than I remember with my el cheapo Polaroid HDTV.Summary: It isn't cheap, but is the best general purpose television I've seen. If you are mainly interested in games, the cheaper Samsung might be the way to go, however.One last thing, when I received mine from Amazon, it had a stuck red pixel in the very center of the screen. Customer service was very friendly, however, and took care of the problem quickly.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "BRAVIA = BRAVO!!!", "Author": "EMAN NEP", "ReviewID": "RE60B4UCD2CIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There's an intimidating amount of HTDVs out there, so hopefully this review will help you narrow your choice down. I'll list the pros first, then the cons, but first I want to comment that if you live in an apartment like I do, a 26\" is really the way to go. It's probably an upgrade from what you currently have and it's not too big that you have to rearrange your living room to accomodate your new TV.Also, I'd like to note that as I don't have Cable TV, I was unable to critique that feature in regards to picture quality.PROS:Great (not excellent) DVD picture quality.Every Polaroid TV I've seen has jaw-dropping picture quality. But although Polaroid is Brand-Name familiarity, I wouldn't associate them in any way with \"quality TVs\" (TVs that would last a long time and offer the features people want).For me, the BEST feature on the Sony Bravia is the fact that you can use it as a computer monitor!!! Can I get a \"Hell Yeah!!!\" Nothing is cooler than having a 26\" desktop in the comfort of your living room.The picture quality is excellent even when I played several levels of Quake 4. There was no ghosting or other glitches, everything ran just as well as it would have on my old 20\" monitor.This TV comes with the cables you need to hook your desktop or laptop up to it--all you need to do is change a few settings in the Control Panel under Display.The TV Remote comes with batteries (2 x AA), the buttons are big, easy to see and the overall layout of the remote is rather simple compared to other remotes I've seen.The Menu screen is easy to access and it's quite easy to change settings. There are several different variations to the Full Screen and Widescreen formats, depending on how you want it.Another huge advantage to this TV is the fact that you have TONS of inputs. There are 3 red/white/yellow inputs! That means you can hook up your DVD, PS2, and XBOX360 at the same time! There are a total of 7 video inputs and there is a nice feature on the menu where you can label which input goes to what.And finally, as you can imagine from a flat-screen TV that's only as wide as your fist, it's really light (35 lbs ?) and the non-bulky box has handles to make carrying it easier. Easily a One-Man Lift, even if you have to go up a few flights of stairs.CONS:I was a bit disappointed when I turned my Playstation 2 on. I was expecting to see the same level of sharpness on the game as on my DVDs or when I used it as a PC Monitor. In the Full Screen mode (20\" viewing window) the picture didn't look any better or worse than my old 20\" Sony Trinitron TV. But as soon as I went to Wide Screen (26\"), the image stretched which of course made the image less sharp. Still playable, definitely, but when you see blurry pixels around text you feel like you wish you could crank the Sharpness up even more.The sound is okay. But as other reviewers online have stated: \"If you have the money to buy a new HDTV, you probably already have a nice stereo system\".Because there are 7 video inputs, you sometimes have to press the TV/Video button 7 or 8 times to get to the input you need. It would have been nice if the TV could automatically detect which input it has to switch to.OVERALL:In a nutshell, if you're looking for a Brand-Name High Quality HDTV that can double as a PC monitor, then this is clearly one of the contenders in your search.If you're looking for the sharpest, clearest picture for DVDs the Polaroid TVs look wonderful (but how reliable are they ???).If you're looking for a Game Console HDTV, every video game store I've been into has the Samsung models and the picture on those is extremely sharp and crisp (but again, how reliable is the whole TV ?).", "Date": "September 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good, not great", "Author": "Beantown Jim", "ReviewID": "R2AANX5035UX8D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Typical for LCD, the set is very well defined--picture wise--but lacks the flair that plasma has.  Thus, it does not impress except to acknowledge the good definition and lack of burn-in.It was a good price; \"quality\" sets in this size were $100-$200 more; even Sony's Bravia later series(the newer models) were the same difference more.  You could get a 32\" set of non-name brand for the same price, but would be taking a chance on warranty support and picture quality.", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony Hits Home Run", "Author": "Keith Mathews \"Mac Guru\"", "ReviewID": "R3E850Z2U3GLMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used the Sony Bravia TV for over seven years now, and it has been solid, reliable and still has the perfect picture it did when it was brand new.The size is perfect for my office, small enough to fit in and yet large enough for the picture to be clear.I have it hooked into a sound system, and the stereo is also clear and deep.In all these years, with it playing hours each day, it has never once needed any repairs.After this, I will only buy TVs or computer screens from Sony.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall good buy", "Author": "Albert", "ReviewID": "R3KFBGU0QGLDMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like it overall except that when I turn it on, it takes a few seconds for the screen to actually turn on.", "Date": "March 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "sony 26 inch bravia flat sceen", "Author": "Warr En A.
