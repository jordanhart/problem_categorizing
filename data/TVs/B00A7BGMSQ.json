I wasn't expecting much, but I did read the reviews before I bought it. So here we go:Pros:It weighs almost nothing.It showed up way before I expected it to. Yay!I had it up and going with no effort as far as turning it on, getting my xbox plugged in. 30 seconds tops, but I don't have cable tv or anything, so I don't know how it goes with that.I was expecting the sound to be horrible from some of the posts I had read, but it's not. Sure, it's a little tinny. But this is a $119 tv, so I am not complaining at all. If you're looking for movie theater quality sound, buy a name brand instead of complaining about a really cheap tv. You do tend to get what you pay for, whiners.It comes with a little magnetic screw driver to use on the con listed below.Cons:The stand itself is crap. Be prepared to wrestle with the screws to put it together. It's also a little wobbly despite my best efforts, but I don't plan on actually touching the tv. So it's not a deal breaker.All in all, I'd buy it again. And again.

At a certain point it might be worth saving up another 100-150 dollars to get to the next \"tier\" in TV quality.  This TV borders on that point.  On the one hand, the price is great.  But there are some downsides:The picture quality is average, especially on fast moving shows like sporting events.  Given the 60hz refresh rate its to be expected, but our other TV (Panasonic) with the same refresh rate is quite a bit better.The sound quality is not good.  I ended up getting a set of external computer speakers and plugging them into the headphone jack.  It sounds much better, but a bit of a hassle.The remote control is not good either.  The layout is fine, but it just doesn't work very well.  The remote has to be pointing exactly at the IR sensor on the TV or nothing happens.  I've tried new batteries and it still does not have a very wide IR range, even if you're a couple of degrees off from the IR sensor, it will not recognize the command.  I've never experience a remote that has to be that accurate to work properly.Pluses:Physically the design of the TV is pretty good.  Its pretty light and has a sleek look to it.PriceSo the TV works, just don't expect superior quality.  I would only use this as a secondary TV in a bedroom or guest room.  If not for the price, It would have been a 2 star product.UPDATE - The TV has started to display \"noise\" and jaggy lines.  This has started within the last week.  Contacted Ocosmo support.  Will keep this review updated based on their response.UPDATE 2 - Submitted RMA request on January 23rd.  As of today, February 6th, have not yet received the box to ship the TV.  I've received the shipping label via email, but no box.  The TV is currently unwatchable due to the issues with the picture.

The backlight bleed is drastically reduced. Instead of having the amber light waves at the bottom of the screen distracting from the picture, there is now minimal light bleed in a couple of places that is nearly imperceptible while watching TV. This I can live with and does not distract from the programming. The second biggest problem was the constant loud hum/buzz that the unit gave off, which was extremely annoying when the TV was muted or idle. The replacement unit does not have this infuriating buzzing. I will be upping my original 2 star review, as I feel the replacement unit is a decent buy for a $120 bedroom TV.The weirdest thing about the replacement unit is that the ports are moved around. Two tv's, 3 days apart, and the side ports and back ports are almost completely different. New TV has the hdmi ports on the side instead of the composite/component/audio out, which are now at the back where the hdmi's were on the first unit. Weird, but they are all accounted for.UPDATED PROS & CONSPros:- Sound is great in a small bedroom. I assumed I'd need a soundbar from reading the other reviews, but in my small space I ended up having to turn the volume down quite a bit from the factory set volume.- They send you a screwdriver to put the stand together and a microfiber cloth to clean your fingerprints off once you're done. Nice touch.- The neck that joins the TV to the base swivels to change the viewing angle. Nice! (photo added)- Picture is perfectly good, especially for a bedroom TV, with some slight backlight bleed in a couple spots that is nearly imperceptible once a program starts playing.Cons:- Remote control is huge and way too busy, entirely too much going on. If you don't have a Roku Streaming Stick then all those Roku buttons on the oCosmo remote just add to the remote clutter. I have a Roku hooked up to it, but not a Roku stick so the Roku controls don't work (unless I'm missing something). If you don't have a soundbar, you've got more remote clutter. The switch input button is oddly placed as well. (photo added)- Input/Source can't be changed by pressing Source repeatedly which scrolls through the available inputs until you land on the one needed. On this remote you must press Source to open the list, then find the arrow keys to move up and down the list then Enter to choose one. Minor quibble, but in the dark especially, having one button to switch inputs is so much easier.- Getting the screws in to attach the neck to the base was a struggle and required some strength to get them flush. Once assembled, the stand feels very cheap, not as sturdy as I'd prefer, but i'm going to trust the oCosmo engineers that it will hold up.- On the replacement unit, the aux cable connection has been moved to a new location, and unfortunately this new location makes screwing in the cable connection extremely awkward and difficult. There is a lip beneath the male connector that doesn't allow the female connector to be screwed in flush without bending the extremely stiff cable wire to try to line up the male/female. It really took some elbow grease and patience to get manhandle it into position enough to get the threads lined up. This was an engineering fail in my opinion.******* ORIGINAL REVIEW 12/4/13 *******I was excited, I was impressed, then I was sooo disappointed. I like to be a cheerleader for brands I've never heard of. Case in point, you can see my review from 2 years ago for my well loved living room TV (brand name TCL, what the heck is TCL?) here on Amazon. Unfortunately, I believe I've gotten a bad apple from oCosmo.Unboxed my 32\" oCosmo, laid out all the parts and followed the Quick Start Guide to put the stand together and attach it to my TV. The process was 9 screws, and they even included the screwdriver. Took me about 30 minutes in total because I'm a weakling and ran into some difficulty attaching the neck to the stand.TV was ready to go and I powered it on and waited about 10 minutes for the channel scan to complete. But 'oh oh', something is wrong. There is so much light bleeding through at bottom of the screen I absolutely cannot focus on what's happening in the movie/tv show that's playing. Let me momentarily bring up my TCL tv again to add some context. My TCL has slight light bleed from the top right and top left corners. This bleed is only when the screen is solid black, such as when the screen saver is active, and does not affect the picture when I'm watching a program. In contrast, the oCosmo's light bleed is so glaringly distracting that it's all I can look at. When viewing a show in SD or full screen format, if a scene is dark or anyone is wearing black, navy blue, a dark color, the hazy yellow blobs of light in waves/blobs along the bottom of the screen are intensified. When viewing an HD movie in letterbox, the hazy waves of amber light beneath the program are equally distracting.I watched TV on the oCosmo for about an hour, wondering if I could just learn to live with it, and I realize that no, I really cannot deal with all those yellow blobs on or under my shows. I have no idea how to return a TV, but I'm going to try to get a replacement and will update my review once I do so.Pros (on first impression):- Sound is great in a small bedroom. I assumed I'd need a soundbar from reading the other reviews, but in my small space I ended up having to turn the volume down quite a bit from the factory set volume.- They send you a screwdriver to put the stand together and a microfiber cloth to clean your fingerprints off once you're done.

I read the reviews and was a little apprehensive because of the sound complaints.  I went ahead and ordered 2 sets.  I was buying them to hang in my bedroom & the guest room.  I figured if the sound didn't work out that I would just use an extra sound bar I had laying around & my guest would just have to put up what they got.  The sets came I took swing-out hangers and hung them in the bedrooms.  They both are swung out at 45 degree angles.  I got them auto programed to cable, tested them out and this is what I found.\u25d8 The sound was adequate & I had no trouble understanding what was being said.

The swivel stand has to be assembled, but that was no problem. The remote is a full remote with buttons for DVD player, etc., and it's easy to navigate through. Picture quality is excellent, but that often depends on your provider's service. The only drawback is the sound isn't quite as good as the more expensive TV's, but it's every bit as good as any CRT (tube) TV that I've ever owned. Once I tweaked the sound with the remote menu it sounded much better, but if too much bass is added there's a slight distortion (common with cheap speakers). This is an LED and I also have an LCD and I can't tell the difference and to be honest, I really don't know what the real difference is between an LED or LCD anyways. This TV has all the options for picture and sound quality plus all the ports for hooking up anything you'd like to add to the TV including Roku. Ohhhh, if there was one minor complaint, it's where the cable port is located. It was a little difficult to screw in the cable because of where it's located on the back underside of the TV. There's not much room for your fingers to tighten the connection and I had to get a pair of pliers to complete the tightening of it due to not being able to get my fingers in there to grasp it tight enough. Other than that, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one of these TV's. I had never heard of oCosmo before and right after placing my order I wondered if I made the right choice considering an unknown name and low price, but I was pleasantly surprised at what a great purchase this turned out to be. I'll certainly keep this brand in mind for future purchases.UPDATE: I've now had the TV for just under two weeks and I'd still highly recommend it and I would have no hesitation in buying another one. However with that said, what I have noticed since now owning it is that the clock is fast. Really fast. It gains about five minutes per day which is frustrating and also the AM/PM doesn't work and I'm unable to set it properly. Not a real deal breaker, just a minor irritation. The sound quality was poor as so many other reviewers mentioned, but I added some small external computer speakers and the sound quality improved dramatically. I would recommend doing that if you're not satisfied with the sound.

The audio isn't bad at all, sounds better than most cheaper Flat screen HDTVs I've come across, although having an outside Audio system probably is a good idea if you want to watch  video in excellent quality whether 5.1 or other.

I'll start by saying if you want a high end, perfect picture TV don't buy this. If you want something decent that works well price can't be beat. Have read comments about not so good picture and sound. Picture is actually very good. Of course I'm not a TV aficionado nor a gamer who would I'm sure have a different opinion.  What I will say about that was it did take me a lot longer to adjust settings to get picture to look good compared to any other TV I've ever owned. So know in advance actual setup is very quick but tweaking settings can be time consuming. Sound took even longer to adjust settings. Although sound does still sound a bit tinny, I made adjustments that make sound pretty good. I could definitely see how the original sound could be very annoying (reminded me of fingernails on a chalkboard). One adjustment I made that actually helped was that I turned off Surround mode. Don't know why that helped but after making numerous other adjustments that was the last one I needed to fix sound. We have never bought a name brand TV (okay..so I'm frugal) and each one has lasted at least 10 years so am hoping our luck will continue.

I bought this tv to replace a Sony I had and I tried my Sony remote for the oCosmo and it worked no problem. This was reassuring since I've never heard of this brand before and I was worried about having to replace the remote at some point.I like to flip through channels fast and I was pleased that this tv allows you to do so. There is very little delay when changing channels. Some cheap tv's have an annoying lag while changing channels, this one doesn't.The stand for this tv swivels from side to side, which is nice if your not going to mount in on the wall. The remote is very thin and cheap feeling, glad I can use my old Sony remote instead. Tv settings are easy to navigate through and well laid out.

The headphone jack is also a nice feature, but it would be nice if it was located in a more accessible spot.For those that complain about the sound quality, you're obviously expecting far too much from an FS TV. If you want decent sound, buy a soundbar or get a decent A/V receiver and surround speakers with a powered sub. Another option might be an oCosmo soundbar - I noticed the TV remote has controls specifically for the soundbar they produce. I can't vouch for the sound quality of that unit though as I've never heard it.Pros:* A good value for a sub-$180 32\" TV.* Bright picture* Contrast is good - colors really pop, although you may want to reduce this from the factory defaults as it is a bit high* Backlight glow (bleed) seems consistent across the panel, IE no hot-corners, etc* Lots of HDMI (including an MHL port) ports as well as a VGA port and composite/component inputs* Pivoting base* VESA mount compatible* Includes a small Philips-head screw driver for base assembly (although if you have one you will probably want to use a power screwdriver instead)Cons:* Backlight bleed is noticeable if you look for it* Base could be better designed to reduce the number of screws required* Long-term reliability & service is a question as the oCosmo brand is new and relatively unknown (at least to me)", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Customer service not great", "Author": "K.

I like that it is Roku ready and the remote functionality for it. I have it hooked to a old roku but now I am thinking of getting the Roku stick and eliminate a extra remote. I also use a antenna and it pulls the ota channels in very good. My only gripe is that it does not show the signal strength on ota channels. The pedestal does turn a few degrees which is a nice touch. The sound which many people have complained about, to me is over exaggerated by others. Most flat screen TV's tend to have a tinny sound. It is very acceptable to me and I have no problems with it. In fact I thought it as a little loud. I had it on volume 1 in the bedroom and it was louder than our old TV. I have to adjust the sound settings at night but the remote makes it super simple to do so.I managed to get this on Cyber Monday for $119. It has been fluctuating in price between $169 and $179. Honestly I feel even at $179 this is a great deal. If you looked at some box stores or even on Amazon you will not find a better value for the dollar than this TV. I highly recommend this TV.Note when it is shipped it is in the manufacturers box. Bright white and orange box. So keep this in mind if you have it left on front porch. It uses a 3 prong power cable similar to that of a desktop pc should you need one( it does come with one). I seen someone mention theirs came with a euro plug.As far as the brand, to my knowledge this brand is a re-branded sceptre model.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Cyber Monday purchase!!", "Author": "J. Remish", "ReviewID": "R2NIA4Q47XIZI5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I along with many others picked this up on Cyber monday for $119 but then got a $10 additional credit by using my mastercard and buying it through my Kindle fire. So for a $109  TV I thought how can I go wrong unless it doesn't work and even then I know Amazon will stand behind their products. So I purchased this TV for my mother to replace a 32 inch 10 year old TV. It arrived by Amazon prime in 2 days by FedEx and was in perfect shape. It took about 10 minutes to unbox and assemble the base to it, extremely simple.Took her 65 lb 32 inch TV off the stand and replaced it with the 14lb new TV and then programmed her comcast remote with the Sony code for this set and she was watching her new set within 20 minutes of the start of the process. The picture quality is good and sharp, colors are good. The sound as almost everyone has mentioned is not so good. I would say the volume on this set is fine. It is the quality of the sound that is lacking. She did not say anything but the sound quality of the old set i took out of her room was so much richer then this new set. However i know from her tastes as long as she can hear it then she is happy with it. The picture quality is vastly improved over what she had, screen was getting lines in it from tube going bad. She thought it was a smaller set and had to show her by measuring both screens that it was the same size screen that she had before , just a much smaller body. Having said that it does have a very small frame to it. The frame is smaller then my 32 inch Westinghouse that I have in my home bedroom. So even I was a little skeptical at first that this was 32 inches. Now if you could get this set for under $150 I would say grab it. Ove that price I would give it a second thought if sound quality was an issue for you. As others have said adding a soundbar or old computer speakers would probably remedy the sound issue. But that adds money to the overall cost and for the total investment it might make sense to look at another set other then this one.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "A pleasant surprise", "Author": "dibs", "ReviewID": "R1XBKWJDOF5U4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on Black Friday for a little over $100. I wasn't expecting much because of how cheap it is even when it's not on sale, but much to my surprise this TV is quite good. It far exceeded my expectations and then some.Pros:- For what it is, the picture quality is superb.- The sound isn't amazing but it's good. If I were using this as my main TV I would definitely invest in a sound bar.- It has a decent amount of inputs which is great.- Once assembled the TV feels pretty solid and swivels fairly easily.- The viewing angles are very good.Cons:(I really can't complain too much and the cons aren't deal-breakers by any means.)-The plastic feels pretty cheap, especially at the base and the swivel mount. While screwing the base to the swivel mount I heard a soft cracking sound. I inspected it and didn't see any cracks but it made me a little nervous. Just be careful when attaching the base to the mount and you should be fine.-The remote is also very cheap feeling/looking and fairly large. It's not a thing of beauty, but again, it's just a remote and no deal-breaker.Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this TV to anyone who's on a budget and doesn't mind 720p.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV especially for the price.", "Author": "sandswoodward", "ReviewID": "R38ZKCAE4PEARY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is perfect.

But, for the price, I am happy with it. I opened the box, and easily attached the base, which involved inserting 9 screws, all of which were provided, and there was even a little screwdriver. The TV looks great on the stand, but up close you can definately see that the labels are not applied with precision, and the bezel (front cover plate/rim) is rather cheap looking from the back. I plugged this in last night and connected my Samsung smart DVD player to watch Netflix, and I was happy with the performance. The speakers were ok, although this is in a bedroom, so maybe in a large room there would be an issue. The picture was just fine, in my opinion, and the remote worked like it was supposed to. All told, I am happy with this TV, and for my cyber monday price of $119, there is NO way that this is a bad deal. Even at the $169 price, this seems like a good option for someone on a budget, or for a kids room/guest room. I am interested in the companies level of support, with them being fairly new.

I mentioned above it doesn't have as many adjustment options as my Samsung, but I think the picture on this @ 720p may actually be better than my 50\" @ 1080p- Adequate sound.

Apart from being at my home when the TV was delivered, it was a total surprise.  LOLShe insisted she was not going to accept this so there was no sense in taking it to her house on Christmas Eve; it was going straight back home with me.  Two days later she was still fussing about how she did not need a new TV.  And then her brother showed up and put the stand on it and screwed the cable line into the TV.Needless to say, she was amazed at the difference.  Ask her now if she would like to return the television.  You will hear nothing except, \"No, no, no!\"  Despite having to listen to her fussing for nearly a month, it was worth every minute of aggravation and I would go through each and every minute ten times over to see her so excited about a gift.(Oh, & it works perfectly.

I was really hesitant to buy this TV as I've been burned with cheap flat screens before. A couple years back I bought a cheap 32\" from another retailer that burned out within 2 months. I had this TV in my cart for about a month but kept hesitating. Finally, the price dropped to $179 and I said to myself \"Amazon's return policy is awesome if there's a problem and if it blows after the 30 day window I can live with eating the $179.:I haven't had this TV *that* long yet but I have faith in it.  It's a great set. I'm constantly blown away by the HD picture quality even when compared to the 32\" LCD in my living room.3 HDMI inputs is great for future proofing. Currently, I have my DVR, Roku, and Receiver plugged in via HDMI. I plan to add a BlueRay player into the mix shortly. I'll probably remove my receiver from HDMI as I really don't need it - it's just for the  OSD. All my older video games (PS2, Game Cube, Original Xbox) are hooked up to an RCA switch which plugs into the TV - works flawlessly.There are some negatives though:The sound isn't good at all. It's really evident when you first start using the set but your ears get used to it. Changing the sound to \"Dynamic\" with the sound button on the remote helps some. However,  I paired the TV with this receiver: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0077V88V8/ and it sounds great! I use the Digital/Optical Audio out from the TV to the receiver. For the most part, I use the TV's speakers at night and the surround sound when I want to immerse myself in a movie.The picture is fantastic overall. I do notice it's hard to see the details on people's faces especially around the eyes in dark scenes. Also in dark scenes people's skin seems to have a yellowish tone to it. I don't know if it's a source issue though - I've only noticed this while streaming so no points deducted there. \"Vivid\" seems to be the best looking picture option.The remote is a bit flunky. If not pointed directly at the sensor it doesn't pickup even with fresh batteries. However, my cable box's universal remote controls the volume and turns the TV on and off while being pointed pretty much anywhere.One star was taken away due to the quality sound and finicky remote.

I am constantly having to even out the tv, it is usually leaning a little toward one side and I have to put papers underneath to stablize it, checking it with a leveler. It's rare that the tv is actually at a 90 degree angle with the surface.Also the internal clock is always off by 10-30 minutes, and the \"auto-clock\" function is useless; it always sets the time and date to 1/1/2000 with a random time.The headphone jack is all the way in the back, and when playing Xbox 360 through headphones I noticed the sound quality can get bad at certain times. It is similar to a song that is less then 120kbps, I don't know how to describe it but only seems to affect the game's audio, and not the custom soundtracks I always have playing.I've pulled on that headphone jack on accident and that really bothers me, I have an extension cord for my headphones and that's barely enough.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Great Price", "Author": "Bob E.", "ReviewID": "R1VINIFF6R9HRF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV has worked very well.

This TV was 80$ cheaper than others known brands and had every options found in models that cost 300+. Has MHL port+3 HDMI, so I can connect almost anything to it. Has Roku compatibility and 2x10W speakers (I boosted this with extra speakers). The colors are great.

I guess that one was the most sought after. Who is to blame? The 1080p 32 inch was the same price as what the 720p is going for now. Im giving it 4 stars because when i ordered mine off of amazon the order somehow never got shipped on its delivery date even though my payment was taken as if the order had been shipped. Thnx to amazons friendly customer service i got it shipped a.s.a.p. after waiting two additional days of its expected delivery date. I was upgrading from my 19 inch and i searched amazon high and low and this seemed to be the best deal for a 1080p t.v. Unlike many online shoppers i actually look at the negative comments before purchasing an item. Thats why im never a bitter shopper. I know what im getting. I havent used all the features on this t.v. but i like how it had 3 hdmi ports. I mainly use this for gaming and i have multiple consoles. I like how i can channel from each hdmi port on the fly just by the remote. It makes it much easier to switch from my 360 to my ps3 and ps4 and etc because i use and hdmi cord for all of them. The sound is bad but i knew that before i bought it but i dont use this for watching cable so its ok. This is such a huge upgrade for me so no complaints here. The HD is really crisp and clear. Its too bad most of my games are 720p. I like how the tv turns itself off when its not been used in awhile. The remote is cheaply made and it is a pain to turn channels with it but luckily these tvs can move at a slight angle from left to right which is nice. I like how it came with a screw driver and screws to put the base on. The set up was pretty easy. One thing i did struggle with were the ports on the back. They have them at an angle to where u might have to lay the t.v. flat just to plug anything into them. That part was a pain. The size of the t.v. is decent for someones bedroom or college dorm room. Its not really big enough for a living room. I like how the t.v. lets you know if something is being played in 480p or 720p or 1080p. That way you never have to question why the quality  suddenly changed. I wish there were better options on how you view the screen. Due to the tv having multiple hdmi ports i can now charge my mp3 player but only while the tv is on which is really cool and it can also play files from my mp3 and slideshow pictures and videos with my mp3 player which is awesome. I could go on and on but these are all the things ive experienced so far.

She has a 15\" laptop she uses and, now that she's 65, her vision isn't what it used to be.  Thought this would be a nice monitor for her, easier for her to read.So far, it has been a good purchase.  I couldn't believe how light it was.  Not really sure if that is unique to the brand or if all  flat screens are constructed to be this light now.  I haven't purchased a flat screen for myself in 12 months, it was a 40\" LED and considerably heavier.  Anyway, b/c of the weight, she can move it easily to clean, and I don't have to worry about her moving it.The couple times I've used it, the picture seems to be pretty good.  I played with the picture a little bit when I set it up.  For what she needs, it's more than adequate.The stand also has a nice pivot feature so it is very easy to turn the screen on an angle.  If I had to guess, I would say it turns 35-45 degrees either way.Only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the packaging for shipping.  I get money has to be saved whenever possible, but to ship a 32\" TV in it's manufacturer display box, especially at Christmastime with all the delivery thefts, seems kind of.....not smart.

So with the price at $159.99 and free shipping with Prime, and $18.00 for a SquareTrade Three Year Warranty - how can I go wrong? Amazon has put themselves behind oCosmo products, and dealing with Amazon has always been hassle-free for me.I received the TV after a couple of days - when I lifted the box I was surprised to how light it was. By the looks, it looks just as good if not better than the other six HDTV's I have in the house of assorted brands.I plugged the Xbox One in, and immediately was up and running - with three HDMI's, thats awesome. I played Netflix from the Xbox on the television, and got totally immersed in the movie without thinking about the TV I was watching it on.The manual is detailed and actually nicely printed on glossy paper, and everything is packed inside a heavier than most zip-lock bag. This may seem like it shouldn't affect the review, but it shows you that it wasn't skimpy in packaging, and there was an investment for this to catch your eye and feel comfortable about your purchase that this isn't just a \"Fly-by-night company\".PROS:Lightweight, especially since I am mounting it on the wall;Crisp picture for a 720p 60MzH;Cost factor;3 HDMI PortsCONS:Internal Speakers;No Optical Audio;Still a 720p 60 MzHAs stated in the cons and by other reviews, the sound quality from the internal speaks are weak - but if you're purchasing a $160 HDTV, what would you expect? And - I purchased the LG Sound bar for $72, I tossed that on with the use of 3.5mm jacks plugged into the headphones since the sound bar has no RCA jacks, and the TV has no optical outputs.Wrapping it up, I believe that for the investment, and since we are using it for game use, and with a $18 three-year warranty added on, its a no-brainer - I would recommend this unit as an add-on system, if you're a college student, or simply on a budget and want the best bang for your buck.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "32 inch TV", "Author": "Laurie R.", "ReviewID": "R37UTNNOHYURLD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV was in perfect condition and is working so well.

It has four screw holes on the back of the TV for the bracket(sold separately), and the pattern is one of the standard configurations.  Installation was a snap.  It came with a base but I obviously didn't need it.  The TV has 3 USB ports on the bottom of it, as well as the power cord come from the bottom, which made wall installation nice.  I used 2 of the ports, one for the Verizon cable box and the other one for my Apple TV.  This thing is plug and play with great instructions for all kinds of setups.  When I went to program my Verizon universal remote, the TV instructions told me to use Sony programming codes, thus why I think Sony is the actual manufacturer.CONS:  None.  Best TV purchase I have made and the great price made it that much sweeter.There is some kind of wireless accessory you can purchase for it as well ( there is a coupon inside the box) but I have not looked into it yet but it sounds like it allows you to receive a bunch of channels for free or at least cheaply.
