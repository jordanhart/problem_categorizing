We first tried Samsung 7100 and though the picture quality was good but it was not consistent as some movies seems to be washed out and required changes to the settings.  Also, the color depth and quality was not as good as my old Toshiba. I had to think twice before returning because the picture clarity and 3D were amazing but didn't like the idea of frequently changing the settings to the liking. With my old LCD, all I do is change the mode but there was ever a need to change the settings.  As we were happy with our old Toshiba, and based on the good reviews, we tried 7350 series. Though the ratings were good but we were not impressed especially when compared to 7100. Coincidentally, during that time, the price of this model came down by $1000, which was still a stretch but we went ahead for the following reasons -Curved LCD - we checked in person as well in a local store.Passive 3D \u2013 Watching active 3D for more than 2 hours caused strainSony picture quality \u2013 review ratings for the similar high end model were very good.It has been a day, and so far we are very much impressed with the TV. It is better than 7100 for sure, and Passive 3D is amazing - I did not find any difference in resolution  between this and Samsung's active 3D, and on the contrary Passive seems to be better as the images do pop out more and image does not seem to shrunk that much.I was little skeptical in the beginning, as there were not many reviews of this model, and whatever reviews that are available on the internet questioned the need for a curve TV. Curve in this TV is very minimal and gives a very good feel and appeal.  The only downside with this TV is the weight - it is very heavy but the build quality is unquestionably the best.I benefited from all the reviews so I hope this review would help folks who are interested at this TV. Also, I purchased this TV directly from Sony store as I got additional discount.I will update later if I find any issues and/or my impression changes.Good luck.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far this TV is amazing", "Author": "Nismoblack \"NISMOBLACK\"", "ReviewID": "R280I8D12ZSCBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this TV open box from Wizard Electroland at a great price and the TV arrived in all original packaging and everything looked 100% brand new. I couldn't even tell the box had ever been opened.Personally I think the curved screen is great. The curve is very subtle and I can't imagine it would cause concern for most people. I don't see that the curved screen really improves anything on the viewing end. From straight on you couldn't even tell the screen is curved unless you already knew it was. From slight to moderate angled viewing it seems to help see the screen better, but at extreme angles I would say the curve making viewing more difficult. I love the curve mostly for aesthetic reasons. I find it makes the tv more unique looking and has a really classy, high-end look to it. I've already gotten numerous compliments from friends and family on it.The picture quality on the TV is outstanding. I'm completely blown away. So far I just did an eye-ball calibration on the set, but I plan to run Disney's WOW calibration to further dial it in. The blacks are very deep and the colors are bright! Skin tones seem to be very realistic. The input lag is amazingly low and the tv is wonderful for gaming. The passive 3D quality is also very good and from a 10 foot viewing distance I can't really notice a drop in resolution.I use a 7.2 home theater system so I haven't used the TV speakers much, but I did test them out just because I'd heard they were really good and I will say they are by far the best sounding stock speakers I've ever heard on a flat screen tv.The TV comes with 2 remotes, which is nice. 1 is a full size remote and the other is a much smaller, cut-down remote with only more basic buttons, but it's nice to have both options. The set also came with 4 sets of 3D glasses.Because the tv has 2 feet at the ends of it you'll need about a 65\" long or longer stand if you aren't planning on wall mounting. I wall mounted mine right off the bat, but this may be a frustration to some. I will add that the feet are really nice. They're made of metal and have a chrome finish and seem to support the TV really well. I've only had cheaper sets with plastic stands in the past.The screen is fairly glossy, but not as bad as others I've seen. If you're planning on having the tv in a brighter room with windows and doing a lot of day time viewing this may be a concern for some. I put the TV in a dark, basement theater room so this isn't a concern for me.The menu is set up well and the tv is very fast and responsive when selecting different menu options. There are a ton of different customization options and the LED light below the SONY logo can be turned completely off or set to only flash when receiving remote commandsI have only 1 gripe with this tv and it's a very small one. The tv does exhibit some flashlighting effect (over-brightness of the led backlighting in the corners) during really dark scenes. It's usually not bad at all and I don't mind it because 99% of the time it's just during credits or an occasional dark scene, but it is visible to me even with the backlighting turned down. None of my friends or family even noticed it until I pointed it out to them, but this could be a concern for picky home theater types.  If the screen goes completely black during a movie this tv seems to turn the backlights completely off (I first thought I'd bumped something the first couple times it happened and powered it off because my older tvs all leave them on when this happens). Now that I'm used to it I love it because the room truly goes fully dark when the movie intends darkness, but if there's anything visible during a black scene some flashlighting will be observed.Overall I love this TV and I highly recommend it especially now that the price has dropped!!! I've read a lot about people being hesitant to buy because they can't find the tv displayed anywhere and are concerned about the curved screen, but like I said above it's a very subtle curve and I can't imagine most people being too concerned with it. It's really nice!", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Simply the Best TV I have ever seen.", "Author": "Annihilator001", "ReviewID": "RZWUU4HT7RHZZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With the limited distribution of this television I took the BIG chance and bought it based on limited reviews I could find on this set.  I would have to say every review stating this is the best TV they have seen is 100% correct. The increase color range adds a whole new look and feel to your movies :)....  The picture has really smooth movements. The curve is just enough to add a nice feel to the screen without the picture feeling like it being squeezed in the middle. I really enjoy the clean look to the set it self, it really sets its self apart from any other TV you will see on the market.  SONY did a outstanding job on the design of this set.Pros:Everything about itReally easy to setup took maybe 5-10 minsThe passive 3D seems to have good depth to it, even the simulated 3D looks impressive. (both in movies/tv and video games)It has the ability for Audio return to your Home Theater Sound System for the television aps (HDMI audio return for the Sony Sync, or the Fiber for none Sony receivers).The Option for wired or Wireless network connectivity is nice.The ability to have the lighted Sony name plate perform different functions, off, interactive (only lights up when the TV receives commands from the remote or if the sleep timer is set), bright to dim.A wide range of adjustments you can do to customize how you want your picture to look.About every Application you can think of for the smart TV capability, one specific one I used so far was Hulu and it was like watching actual cable TV (the activation was simple).Con: the display does appear to be more reflective that my other screen...  But it is not too bad.  I think this set would have really benefited from satin finished screen.I can tell you your friends will want to come over to watch movies once they see this TV.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV -- You get what you pay for!", "Author": "DNP \"DNP\"", "ReviewID": "R30PTP3UN63KN7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a bit hesitant at first about this TV because it was priced a bit high (relative to the Samsung counterpart), and not many reviews online.  But, I must say that the reviews I found were mainly positive, and I've been happy with Sony's TV products in the past.  So I took a chance, and I have to say, this TV is fantastic.  The picture quality is flawless.  The speakers are this TV are excellent, as it essentially has two sound bars along the edges.  Even the bass is pretty solid coming out of a TV.  But if you get this TV, I definitely recommend hooking it up to an actual A/V Receiver for the best sound quality.I've owned this TV for about 3 weeks now -- let's just say you'll start watching TV a lot more simply because the picture quality is mind blowing.  I owned a 5year old 47\" 1080p LG LCD before.  There's simply no comparison.One thing that I was skeptical about regarding this TV is the refresh rate of 120HZ.  I was hoping that given the price for this TV and the fact that it's a relatively new, high-end TV, the default refresh rate would be 240HZ.  But, I do not see any fuzz, whether I'm watching fast paced sports or movies.  Apparently 120HZ seems fine to me.The curved feature is also a great look - though I was skeptical about it when I ordered it online (without having seen it at any store).

They have display room settings that make the television look just a bit different than when you get them home. However, once this was installed and in the living room of my new house, I can't imagine ever going back.I will not be spewing a bunch of technical mumble-jumbo. You want to know if this is a good TV. Period. The answer is YES. And the 3D is movie quality (even in the enhanced mode!). Yeah, this baby has an enhanced mode that makes EVERYTHING look 3D. I popped in one of my favorite horror movies and switched to the enhanced 3D...sweet. This is going to make football season even more fun!The picture is super sharp and vivid in any mode.

The subtle curve and deep black panel make it look like a nice piece of high-tech equipment in the home.And of course it looks even better when you turn it on: excellent detail, clarity, and best of all - the colors.  Accurate skin tone, and the colors can pop if you want them too.  Also, deep inky blacks with excellent contrast.  The curve isn't really noticeable while watching a movie or show, much in the same way a movie screen's curve disappears in the theater.If there's a gamer in the house, in Game Mode this TV is rated as one of the lowest input lag of any TV you can buy.  I haven't tried a 3D movie yet, but have been very impressed with the passive 3D on the Playstation 3 and PS4.But no TV is perfect, and this one's flaw seems to be inconsistent (non-uniform) backlighting.  Fortunately, local dimming and the LED Control setting can eliminate this issue during regular programming.  So even though solid white or color test screens might show some slightly non-uniform patches, these flaws aren't noticeable watching TV or movies.  And when the screen fades to black - it looks like the TV is turned off.  The main exception to this is a black screen with some content, like credits over black.  Some flash-lighting can been seen because of this TV's LED backlights.Other things to know - the screen is pretty reflective, and the curve can distort the refection.  So if there's a window or a lamp directly behind the viewer, the reflection might appear exaggerated, or disappear, because of the curve.  Also, this TV is best viewed straight on, because off-axis viewing distorts the colors and black levels a little bit.  Lastly, this sucker is over 100 pounds, so keep that in mind if you are mounting.So I knocked off one star for these issues, but the most important thing to note is watching movies and TV programs on this TV is a treat.  The colors and black levels are very impressive, and the backlight issue may or may not be noticeable or bother everyone.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Curved Screen Beauty", "Author": "Bill H \"smknbud\"", "ReviewID": "R3ITL3ASALLW6M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The color and image quality is excellent.

Really beautiful looking television with an excellent quality display. It is easy to use and very feature rich, from apps to 3D (passive). For those curious about the curve, it is not very dramatic, but it is nice how it reduces some glade from side viewing. In general it adds a neat dimension to the television and makes it stand out from the competition. The speakers on this unit are also quite excellent, among the best I have heard.The only real negative I can say is that the two side mounted feet may require a large entertainment center, assuming you do not plan on wall mounting. It is trivial to me, but others may find it problematic if they have limited space.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV, best of 2013 Sony HD Sets", "Author": "C Jay Blair", "ReviewID": "R25MUGALTNXE2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this model for about 10 days now and truly love almost everything about it with the only significant flaw being some clouding due to set not having full array local dimming; see further noes below.  Unless you plan on sitting less than 6 feet from your set this model will be hard to tell apart from a UHDTV.  Love that because the 3-D is passive I can now use clip-on 3-D glasses (that also work at the local cineplex) over my prescription glasses.  Clip-on glasses aren't included but are under $5 a pair.This model has not had any significant professional reviews which is a shame.  Most comments that have been made only talk about the \"gimmick\" of the curved screen; but I see it only as a worthwhile enhancement, both to the designer looks of the set but more importantly to the image quality, including a perception of greater depth and in expanding the off-axis viewing angle.PROS:Great near plasma blacks and shadow detail.Best 3-D I've seen, uses passive tech, 4 pairs of glasses included.Even simulated 3-D is effective for some films, like for The Fifth Element, though I have no plans to use it further now that I satisfied my curiosity.Great sound from the side speakers, only beat by the best sound bars, and has subwoofer output if you want to beef up the sound.Immersive slightly curved screen that does not detract from the viewing experience.Beautiful set to look at.Nobody does deep, rich and natural color better than Sony.Stands attached from factory but easy to remove for wall mounting.CONS:Has two separate remotes but neither one is backlit.Skype camera not included.Very heavy and need at least 65\" stand to hold it.Screen is very reflective and this needs to be considered in placement.The one significant flaw is that this model suffers from some clouding when watching in dark environment; not though a fatal flaw because it can be calibrated out to a large degree and does not show with most program material.Still in process of tweaking my settings but will update the review once I'm comfortable with them.  One thing though that I would say is that the Resolution setting is a great enhancement that should not be turned off as some reviewers of similar Sony models have suggested.  Very useful in the range of 40 to 60, and seems to be one of the settings that helps with clouding.  Backlight seems to work best at about 6 in dark room and 9 or 10 (max) in a brighter room and for 3-D.This TV replaced a Panasonic model 65ST50 plasma and I don't regret it because for other than slightly poorer blacks on the Sony, nearly everything else is an improvement.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "its a top quality TV", "Author": "George85260", "ReviewID": "R1PQNGHMVALAE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is a quality you can expect from Sony.Amazing image, easy to set up and great features.

For the other 5 star ratings, nothing against your reviews. Glad you were able to luck out and get a great set. Mine however is a very mixed bag. The curved screen is cool and the viewing angles do appear to be improved. However, the screen uniformity is awful. I'm not the only one with the same issues. There are others (see avforum) who have had the same clouding and flashlighting issues I have experienced. The blacks are definitely not black on my set but rather deep treys at best. No amount of adjusting seems to help. Even after going through several phones calls and emails with Sony to improve, nothing helped the picture improve. Sony would not send a tech to look into the issues but rather had the response that the issues I am experiencing are common to LED TVs, and they therefore would not attempt to fix anything. This set is being returned to them for a full refund. Back to the hunt once more. So frustrating.I have also tried out the 65W850A, which had some problems in certain months of manufacturing and I got a few bad ones. I can say, however, that the picture on the 65W850A easily rivals this set, however, I prefer the S990 due to passive 3D. Still, with both having issues, I have not yet found the perfect set for me.Happy hunting.
