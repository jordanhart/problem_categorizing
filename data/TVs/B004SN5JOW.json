Picture looks better than any dlp, lcd, or led that Ive seen! Also no stupid lamps that burn out within a year. I replaced 2 in my Samsung within 2 years, never sgain. TV stays on half the day and no degradation in quality at all! Also blu ray, ps3, and Xbox all look great on it! If you can find this TV, buy it, you won't be sorry.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "6th Avenue Electronics is TERRIBLE", "Author": "T. Howe", "ReviewID": "R1DUYVKUFBVI6H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased this TV nearly two months ago. We received a broken TV, severely broken. 6th Avenue customer service is pure BS. We've been getting run around to Amazon, 6th ave, and their random shipper for over a month now with no resolution in sight. No one, (even Amazon whom I thought could do no wrong), seems to care at all.LG makes great products, and I'm sure this unit works fabulously when it arrives in working condition.DO NOT PURCHASE FROM 6th AVE ELECTRONICS!!! Buy from Amazon directly, or go somewhere else.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Good Picture", "Author": "Stan", "ReviewID": "R1G9ZO8IGLGCI1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV has a great picture, and 50\" is plenty big for my living room. My only reservation is that it is an energy hog and gets very hot, which increases the load on the air conditioner in our hot Texas summers. It does have various energy saving settings, which dim the picture a bit, but produce less heat and use  less electricity, and I use the energy saving settings in the summer.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "great picture but limited longevity", "Author": "khf", "ReviewID": "RYRN9NLFA7W1J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have read several reviews on this LG plasma TV, and other users have also experienced serious problems after one year of usage (beyond the warranty period).  Check out the user reviews on LG's website.  Several users experienced the same problem with the unit malfunctioning suddenly and turning itself on and off in rapid sequence.  Fortunately, I had purchased the unit using my AMEX which extended the warranty automatically.  The LG serviceperson was only prepared to swap in/out circuit boards (no testing is done anymore since it is easier for them to replace whole boards), and as I suspected, it was the main power board.  With the labor charge, the repair totaled more than $500.  It seems tragic, but it probably would have been better to toss out the set and purchase a more efficient LED TV.  Hope this helps those of you that encounter the same problem - maybe you can look into purchasing the main power board (part #EBR65773701) and do it yourself (since the replacement does not require any expertise - just care in handling the board and plug-in connectors carefully).  Given similar reports from other users, I suspect that the set will last another year or two if I am lucky.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for cable and satelite", "Author": "Fritz", "ReviewID": "R13VDXU41K5GOQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The TV will only pick up 1/4 the channels over the air that my Tivax converter box will. The program info only gives the present info. My Tivax gives info for many hours. The closed caption is dificult to use. Why don't they make the closed captions at the bottom of the screen? The CC are in the midle of the screen. Why can't they make the CC's adjustible from the upper left corner to the lower right corner?Excelent picture on the three channels I can get in HD.
