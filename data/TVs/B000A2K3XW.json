Mccord", "ReviewID": "R111GFN29U1G57", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well, after wayyy too much research and hemming and hawing, I finally decided on this 3LCD RPT by Sony. What finally swayed me was the sweet combination of picture quality (PQ) and price.  In side by side comparisons I just couldn't detect enough (with my eyes at least) PQ difference between this RPT and the plasma tv's to justify spending twice the money.  While standard definition signals are only mediocre, the HD and DVD signals are simply awesome.  I use component cables and a Motorola set top box (stb) provided by Adelphia.  The side to side viewing angle is greatly improved over previous generations of projection tv's (as is the brightness and crispness), but beware; the vertical viewing angle is quite narrow. My built-in media niche is elevated a bit, which puts the tv above my head when seated on the couch.  There is a very slight dimming from this angle.  However, it's nothing that I haven't been able to compensate for with some picture adjustments (or a subtle shim ;-)).  The remote has a \"Wega Gate\" feature that works kind of like the \"Start\" button in MS Windows.  I think it's pretty user friendly, but I don't use it much since I mostly just use the remote from the Adelphia stb.  As an engineer, I also appreciate the other features this LCD RPT technology offers over plasma. It uses less energy, generates less heat (a factor when building it into a wall unit with tight clearances), it's light enough for one person to move around (the salesperson in the store carried this 42\" tv singlehanded!), the plastic screen has less glare than glass, and the single bulb is user serviceable. Best of all; no burn-in issue to worry about!  Just plug it in and start watching tv, use it as a computer monitor (I haven't tried this yet), or just run a static image all week.  Who cares! Sony offers this tv in a 50\" version, but because our viewing distance is 8'-10', I didn't want to go any bigger.  If you get too close to these screens you will see some screen door effect.  After having this tv for several weeks now, I can honestly say that I am very pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "September 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "TV: 4 stars; Amazon: 0", "Author": "J. Naylor", "ReviewID": "R3HOOZ0QBAA43X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, the price was great; much cheaper than the local brick and mortar electronic stores at the time I was originally making the purchase.. TV is wonderful. Seeing this TV side by side the Samsung DLP's in the stores convinced me I made the better choice. The picture is fantastic, great features. I only wish it had PIP, but I'll survive. I work from home, and I also have set up my laptop to use the TV as a monitor... It is working out really well..Now to Amazon, and some of the chaos I endured in taking shipment... Please don't make the same mistakes I made; this experience tainted my view of Amazon, and below I note some things that may prevent you from going through the same hell..The delivery guys showed up on time on delivery day.. Upon climbing out of the truck, I was handed the paperwork and was asked to sign before they even pulled it out of the truck (<--Mistake 1). After the TV was brought up into my apartment, the delivery guys left. I immediately opened the TV to find it completely destroyed. I stopped the driver before he left, and told him to take the TV back; he told me to call Amazon and he'd pickup the TV when he came to deliver me a new one, which Amazon would replace; they then drove off (<--Mistake 2). Upon calling Amazon, I was ultimately told that the TV is mine if I signed for it and if I didn't get it back on the delivery truck for return, because there is a 'no-return' policy on large merchandise, which I understood. Regardless, AMAZON HAD NO INTEREST IN HELPING ME, THE CONSUMER, OUT. Reading through the shipping and no-return policy; I noted that the shipper was supposed to unpack the TV, let me inspect it, and then remove the packing material. Since they did none of the above, and noted this to Amazon, I felt as if they should have supported me. Instead, they took in my report, threw it to a team who never cared to personally call me, and then wrote me an email saying the case was closed, because they had information stating that I asked for the shippers to NOT unpack the TV. Which was a lie. Nobody from Amazon was willing to negotiate the issue in my behalf with the shipping company. There is no direct number to call Amazon, they call you from an 'unknown' number so you can't call back. Amazon ran away from me.I made a last ditch effort to call the shipping company, Eagle, who was EXTREMELY polite, understanding, and they negotiated with Amazon the pickup and replacement of my TV. Now THAT is a classy and moral corporation; only if those guys would go into business selling the products :D. After they accepted the blame, Amazon came through with an email apoloziging for the inconveniences I was caused, for simply not believing me. In the end, one month after ordering the TV, I finally took shipment of a working set, which was properly delivered. Take note, prices at the local stores in this timeframe dropped to a level where I could have bought it locally for only a few dollars more, with the security of a return policy, and someone you can interact with if the transaction doesn't go smoothly.Seriously, would you think I'm ordering anything ever again from such a fair-weathered company? May I suggest you think twice as well?", "Date": "March 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great TV To Complete Your Home Theater", "Author": "Michael K. Zupan \"mzupeman2\"", "ReviewID": "RW93CD620GPKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had spent some time researching what kind of TV it was I wanted to blow my money on.  You can't just buy any old TV anymore, you need to research so you can best suit your own needs.  I personally watch a lot of DVD's and play a lot of video games.  So, I needed something that was going to handle games well, and most of all make DVD's look stunning!The television's design is sleek and stunning.  It only weights about 60-65 pounds so you can move it yourself with ease.The display is very bright and vibrant.  The TV when you recieve it, has its settings set to contrast and other settings that would make the TV look absolutely magnificent for store displays but will in the long run burn out your bulb faster, and fortunately, those settings aren't the true correct settings you want anyway.  Set the 'vibrant' picture settings to 'standard', you may want to add your tint a few notches over to the right a little bit to get a more true red color, reduce your color a little bit, but in the end it's all just minor adjustments you are going to need to make.If you watch a lot of DVD's like I do, if you sit far back enough, they look magnificent watching them with progressive scan and component cables.  But if you sit a little closer than you're supposed to like I do, you'll notice all the imperfections that you would see due to the fact that DVD's are not as high in definition as a high definition TV, because DVD's were made to look perfect on standard TV's.  You could see some boxes in some high movement, artifacts here and there, but this TV offers numerous ways to adjust the picture to your liking.  There's DVD players now that 'upconvert' with technology a DVD that's got a 480i resolution, to 720p by adding lines and throwing out some of the noise on a DVD.  But with this TV it's not necessary with the 'Digital Reality Creation' feature (DRC).  This helps to upconvert the image to be somewhat closer to HD standards, by adding 4x the lines (twice as many horizontally and then twice as many vertically).  This isn't going to give you a high definition image mind you, but you can use this function to adjust the clarity and 'reality' of the image to smooth out imperfections and artifacts that are created by a lot of movement.  There's even a function on the TV that lets you adjust just how much 'noise' you want filtered from a picture.Now, all this could be a pain if you were to have to continually make these kinds of adjustments between different inputs on your set and your digital/HD cable, but this TV will save your presets for each input.  It may take you some time to get the best possible picture that you want from each component, but the time is worth it because you only need to do it once for each function and it saves them forever.Great set for a great price.  Worth the cash.", "Date": "November 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "My first HDTV and I love it.", "Author": "J. Park", "ReviewID": "R3RUWJ3COUNMSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had considered the Samsung 4667 46\" DLP HDTV and was all set to buy it when the Sony 42A10 showed up. I was at the store and I had a chance to compare the picture quality of both. I am one of the population who is susceptible to the rainbow effect of DLP's as I found out when looking at the Samsung. The 42A10 is part of the newest generation of LCD rear projection tv's from Sony and the picture quality shows it...the colors are bright and crisp. The improvement in picture quality is noticeable in comparison even to last year's Sony models. I bought the Sin City DVD specifically to flex the 42A10's muscles with my progressive scan dvd player...I was not disappointed and my friend who borrowed the dvd to play in his Sony 50A10 concurred with such adjectives as 'amazing.'The only downside is sometimes during rapid image movement there is noticeable pixelation (artifacts) but I am confident this is due to the Adelphia HDTV Motorola set top cable box which is something I am stuck with rather than chosen. I also wish there were 2 HDMI i/o slots (having only 1 slot is not unique just to the Sony models) instead of one as I am using the sole port for an HDMI-to-DVI cable to my HD cablebox which prevents me from using an HDMI-to-HDMI tv to dvd player connection. LG will supposedly be introducing 2 HDMI slots in their next gen models and LG uses a newer generation of Texas Instruments' DLP technology over Samsung from what I have learned. Stay with HDMI or component cables...the composite, s-video and coaxial cables result in a noticeable reduction in picture quality. On a separate note, the footlong remote control not only looks ungainly but is really useless for cable viewing unless you use the CableCard technology...probably a sly way of convincing people to pay $300 for the glitzy bells and whistles Sony universal remote.Regardless, in my visit to the store to do some direct in-person comparisons I could honestly not find a brighter clearer picture among rear projection HDTV's than the new Sony's. The Sony's are second only to true LCD and Plasma tv's which have their price and screen burn-in issues but the quality of the Sony's have closed the gap.I haven't watched so much PBS (which is broadcast separately in a 24hr HD channel) since my childhood watching Sesame Street. I have a hard time going back to watch regular digital cable channels because now they just look like garbage especially in the normal 4:3 aspect ratio. I love my tv...when driving home from work, I wonder what's going to be on for me to gaze at while I kick my heels up...when was the last time you felt that on your way home from a long day at work?

For me, my digital/HD channels no longer came in when this happened.  After doing a \"reset to factory settings\" as described in the manual, the TV went back to normal.  My guess is that TV's software/firmware has got a bug.  I did an online chat with the tech support from Sony but that had no clue.  I can only hope that our complants will get them to find a fix for the problem.  I've got a call into the local Sony repair folks, maybe that can fix it as I'm happy the reset cleared the problem but I don't want to be going this on a regular basis.

Provides great HD quality but at a price well below flat panel LCD or Plasma screens.  The quality of picture, in HD or regular, is great, even in a room with lots of light.  The whole unit is not very deep (see specs) so doesn't have to sit way out.  The side bezel is amazingly small so no space wasted on each side by plastic filler or speakers.  Check out the weight... it is light and can be moved MUCH easier than the traditional CRT TVs of past.  It also will likely sit on your old TV stand since not much wider than the screen itself.  Speakers are at bottom and, for TV speakers, are just fine.  Unit is very clean looking so doesn't overpower the room yet looks up-to-date.  It includes over-the-air tuner for traditional signals AND for high def signals. (Prior models did not have built-in HDTV tuner, an expensive option).  If you put up an antenna you can get HD signals over the air at NO charge and picture is perfect (assuming antenna can reach station)...we have canceled cable and just use over-the-air HD broadcasts!  Includes diagnostic signal meter for signal strenth.  Sony also includes CableCard option for those with cable and unit includes all types of inputs & outputs so plenty of options.  The prices on these keep dropping so watch.  Only con I can think of is there is not a true picture-in-picture (two active stations at once)...at least I can't find it; and most TV stands are wider than this unit as they were designed before Sony made these so compact.

I originally wanted the 50\", but it would have been too big for our situation.  We are about 9 - 10 ft. from the TV when watching it, and it seems to be the perfect distance.I've had the TV for two weeks, and currently have it on basic analog cable and am thrilled with the picture quality.  I'm expecting it to get even better when I upgrade to digital cable and HDTV in a couple of weeks.  DVD's look awesome (Finding Nemo was absolutely incredible!), and the tv is super easy to use.  I basically got it home, hooked it up to the cable and DVD player, let it run through it's automatic station set up, and haven't done a thing since.  CC provides a DVD to help adjust all the settings, but I have not used it yet.  I have not had to make an adjustment and it looks great.  I did buy the 4-year extended warranty that covers the replacement of the light - the light costs $200, and CC will give you at least one, even of the old one does not burn out in the warranty period.  So far, couldn't be happier.Update:  3/01/2006I purchased the Terk Indoor HDTV Antenna (#TRK HDTVI) just for kicks to see if it could pick up any HD while I wait for another week for the cable company.  I plugged it in, and ran the set up program on the tv for the antenna.  Much to my shock, it picked up a bunch of stations in HD and looks fantastic.  I live around 30 miles north of Chicago, and NBC, ABC, PBS, FOX, WGN all have fantastic over-ari HD reception.

We are so thrilled by the positive facets of this HDTV that we are blinded by anything negative.  We just love it.The picture quality is breathtaking.  I realize I am repeating myself but my enthusiasm provokes it. The manual was not very difficult to follow.  It was suggested by a friend that we use the THX option on a DVD to do a video calibration.  Of which we did and it just seemed to all fall right in to place, not to say their were any radical changes from the default.

Daneker", "ReviewID": "RQOTC9FWNQCOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a major investment, $1600.00 is enough to make me paranoid just to own it. The downside is that the bulb assembly is $275 from Sony and eventually the bulb WILL need to be replaced.Haven't noticed any issues anyone else had, but I bought mine in Feb. '06 and I see most of the purchases here where in '05 not long after the model was released. Now, onto the specifics.I wanted the 50\" but couldn't fit it in the space I had, so I settled on 42\" but am still very happy. The TV is NOT out-of-the-box friendly, if you are not savvy have a tech set it up and set all your picture adjustments. It took me weeks and weeks and still six months later I am tweaking it out for best quality. Firstly, there are the basic controls, contrast, sharp, color, etc. but there is a Normal, Vivid and Custom settings on the main imputes (including HDMI)so listen close, go into custom and try all the settings with various images until you are happy, and read the manual!Now, how does it look? Well the 1080i I get from comcast is great, mostly, but that comcast has sheeting issues (you see those damned little square digital images when the screen gets busy) best viewed 10' -  18' from TV and looks great. Dead blacks, good whites (never quite pure, but the winter snow in Narnia & LOTR looks great!) I also have a 480p DVD player (can't wait for HD!) which looks better than standard Cable, not as good as HDTV but again, from about 12 feet away it's near flawless and I'm happy.The only thing is, when I have HDMI input from comcast I get no optical audio out to my receiver, but I believe this is a Comcast / Motorola (these boxes, suck) issue, not the TV.Take advantage of the three component inputs for your DVD, PS(2) and GameCube! Both look awesome on here! There is a setting to stretch the 4:3 image to 16:9 with a bit of clipping on top and bottom and a bit of stretching that makes the picture look almost perfect even though it wasn't actually a widescreen image. I use wireless controllers and play from 12' away and the games look crystal clear.Also, this is an LCD so interlaced and progressive scan look equally good. The TV doesn't have a flicker, it shows all lines at once by storing half in memory for 1/30 of a second and then showing all scan lines at once! It looks great.The downside? Regular cable sucks! We must have all HD and now! Regular channels don't fill the screen (of course) and tend to have a lot of digital sheeting.I love this TV but, get a spare light from Sony right away (it's easily changeable) and stick it over you closet! It could be 2 or 5 or 10 years, but if it blows you have no TV until they can ship a new one! Mines worked perfectly since the moment I plugged it in, so you get no complaints here.Also note, this TV has no burn in and no moving parts but for a cooling fan! Regular DLPs have a spinning wheel (or now three!!!) and can make a lot of noise or break down more easily.This TV is also so light one person can lift, and it can be mounted on a wall.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV!!", "Author": "H.

I was planning to place the TV on a stand, not the wall, and I do not need the incredible viewing angle of plasma, so there was no reason to spend the extra money for the truly-flat TV.For comparison, I am moving from a 26\" CRT HDTV to this unit. The size difference is amazing, but that is to be expected by gaining more screen real estate. What surprised me is that even on 480i or 480p broadcasts, the picture is markedly better on this set than on my previous CRT. I'm honestly not sure if it's because of the size difference again (larger = more detail shows?), or because of the TV itself, but it's great.My only real complaint is that I cannot access an on-screen guide using the TV, as the CableCARD technology is only one-way at this point. However, I will not penalize the TV's rating because the CableCARD technology is immature; that's not this TV's fault.I, for one, actually like the thought of changing a bulb every 12-24 months in my TV. Remember: the phosphor in CRTs and plasmas will lose the ability to glow over the years, and that can't be replaced. The backlight in standard LCD screens will lose brightness and go out over time, and that can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace. However, this TV only has one component for which failure is expected: the bulb, which I can replace myself in five minutes for ~$200.My last \"pro\" is the TV's weight. I moved my old CRT off of the TV stand, and almost killed my back doing so. I was able to lift this TV into place with almost no effort. The entire unit weighs about 60-65 pounds, and the weight is in all the right places. Even though it's light enough to lift with ease, Sony included one final touch that I am thankful for: rubber feet.

I even had no problems getting local HD chanels over-air FREE. I was so happy. However, once I got cable...my mood changed. I reliazed that if the signal coming in is not High Def. then the picture can be \"grainy\" (little boxes around images) when there is a fast movement on the screen. Fast movements such as those in basketball games, soccer games, or simply person speaking.This is due to the signal coming in not being HIGH enough so it is streched over the screen. Here is explanation from SONY website:\"Inferior picture quality may occur on a High-Definition Television (HDTV) with a screen size over 36 inches when viewing a standard-definition signal. This is because the lines of resolution provided by a standard-definition signal are enlarged in order to properly fill the screen. Enlarging the lines of resolution not only increases the size of the video image, but will also make it easier to see video noise in the picture that causes distortion. For this reason, the picture quality on a HDTV is best when viewing a high-definition signal.\"I do have HD programing, and those are great, but there are very few chanels at this time, what do I do with other 200 standard digital chanels? If the signal coming in is not HD, then it should just give regular picture. But it does not, its all grainy and anoying.END RESULT: I was happy with the purchase until I realized that the regular standard digital cable chanels will always be grainy and not \"normal\". HD chanels are perfect, but there are very few HD chanells out there.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY  -- see class action lawsuit re: defects", "Author": "T.

I have been nothing but pleased with my purchase and HD Channels look like still images... just soooo crisp and clear... Thanx to my HD PVR box from Rogers (here in Canada), I can record my shows in HD and view at leisure...One thing that I found somewhat bothersome with the TV was the way the HDMI input works.  I have my HD PVR box hooked up with the TV directly using an HDMI cable.  Also I have a digital coax cable connecting the digital audio out from the HD PVR to the A/V Receiver.  Only problem though, even if the HD broadcast is in Dolby Digital 5.1, I get only 2 channel sound on the A/V Receiver.  In order to get 5.1 Channel DD sound, I have to get into the Settings of my HD PVR Receiver, change the Audio to :Dolby Digital\" from \"HDMI\" to get 5.1 channel DD sound.  That's a few extra steps that I don't really want to take if I don't have to.  If I leave the \"Dolby Digital\" selected in the settings, I get no sound from the TV at all.  So when I'm done watching a show in 5.1 DD sound, I need to switch back to the \"HDMI\" audio mode so that the TV sound can funtion normally and everyone at home doesn't go nuts trying to get sound out of the TV.

Chaudhry", "ReviewID": "RNNC074E7NJ5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always been somewhat prejudiced against rear-projection TVs. Mostly because I judge them based purely on the way they used to be in the 1990s; Huge and heavy that never showed a clear picture or sound...the kind where you could not see a thing on the screen unless you were sitting dead-on in front of it.This Sony WEGA LCD Rear-Projection TV has changed my outlook towards its brethren completely. I honestly never thought in my wildest dreams that a rear-projection TV can looks this good and sound this amazing. Honestly, it has the best sound system I have ever heard in a TV by far, from loud booming bass to directional sound...yes, I said directional. The TV makes it sound like surround sound straight from its somewhat hidden speakers. I don't know how it does it, but it does.Moving onto the display, it is bright, crisp, and comes with a plethora of options and customizations to suit your viewing taste. HD Channels come to life in the clearest and crispest picture I have ever seen. And you have a variety of options for viewing non-HD channels.Since the TV takes input up to 1080i I have all my devices (Xbox 360, Digital Cable, DVD player) hooked up to it with nothing less than component cables. The devices that can natively transmit in HD, such as the Xbox 360, flourish on this TV. I have never been so immersed in the sights and sounds of video games before!Viewing angles: there are close to none! You can see this TV from an INCREDIBLY wide range! We have one of those TV stands where the top swivels, but we never have to even move it regardless of where we are sitting in the living room...the picture is just as crisp and clear no matter which side and however large of an angle you view it from.The only angle you have to watch out for is vertical/height. I did notice a bit of difference in the picture if you are standing up or sitting down (depending on the height of the TV compared to yours). But even that is only if you are standing within 4-feet of the TV.Lastly, the one factor that basically sealed the deal for me with this TV is the fact that you can replace the lamp yourself. The lamp has a life of 1.5 to 2 years (depending on how much you watch the TV) and spare ones can be bought straight from Sony or from a variety of places online for under $200. To replace it, you just open a hatch on the side of the TV (no screws), take out the old lamp cartridge, put in the new one. Yes, that's it! Additionally the TV itself actually tells you when it is time to replace the lamp...there is a light that comes on when the TV notices that your lamp is approaching the end of its life. Our TV still has its original lamp in it and it is close to 2 years old. I bought a spare lamp online just in case, but I haven't had to use it yet; the picture is still crisp and clear as it was the very first day.", "Date": "March 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Value, Great product!", "Author": "G.

Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves.My cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me.  Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite.  My first impression had me rather worried.  I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.The quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking.Set-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual.  Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon.

Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.All in all, a great set at a great price, I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner.", "Date": "September 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Product", "Author": "Joe Mamma \"Return to sender\"", "ReviewID": "RM5VXGWUJNLVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got mine locally for $1100 dollars.

I plugged the projection TV and press power button.  I saw the initial setup on the screen momentarily, then a clicking sound and then it shut down. Then the red light blinks 4 times repeatedly.  I tried again several times, unplugging the tv completely, doing the factory reset as mentioned in the manual but still the same. I will return this TV today and get a new one, it's too much of a hassle.  I was dissapointed this happened to me after finally deciding to get this TV based on excellent reviews.

This set is replacing a 46\" Mitsubishi standard projection \"HD ready\" set bought in 2001.Moving to a new home, we are in need of a set with a slimmer profile.  We do have a little wiggle room, no need to look at a wall mount display.  This set fits my size requirements perfectly.I've never been impressed with DLP or plasma, though lately some of the higher-end plasma sets seem to be improving.  This set seemed to be the ideal price/size + features.  And the amount of positive reviews of this set really pushed me in this direction.PLEASE NOTE:  I have not had this set professionally calibrated, which may improve the picture slightly.For the money this set is a good value.  If you want superb picture and price is not as much of an issue I'd keep looking.Update:  By default the \"Vivid\" video setting is turned on.  While shapening the picture it also introduced a number of artifacts, at least on my standard def input.If I could revise my star rating I'd probably bump it to 3, possibly 4 stars.  2 is definitely too low.", "Date": "April 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "This is a spanish review", "Author": "Martin Gallo", "ReviewID": "RSXHNYJMH1ZWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Despues de tanto informarme de todos los diferentes modelos de Tv y sus tecnolog\u00edas (DLP, LCD, PLASMA, etc), mi desici\u00f3n fue comprar este modelo, realmente estoy muy satisfecho con \u00e9l, excelente calidad de imagen en alta definici\u00f3n, actualmente tengo conectado mi xbox 360 y no me quedo de absolutamente nada.... se v\u00e9 excelente  a partir de 2 metros de distancia.

But I guess  was lucky when I bought this TV I got 5 years warranty with it.So hope I'll call them, they can solve this problem,In my house. because Sony don't do nothing after 30 days,just some B.S you.With this LCD TVs these days make sure buy warranty with it. Because they very new and they are not there yet like CRT TVs are. So if u wants to buy this TV,Or any LCDTV's be careful.! 2004 model of this TV, light bull burnt after few months.
