{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exellent value, very good picture quality, recommended.", "Author": "Stargazer. \"Stargazer.\"", "ReviewID": "R3APE2W8JODHF3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I choose this tv, the Sony Bravia KDL-46EX520 from the picture quality I observed in the dealer showroom, it was as good overall as tvs costing 1/3 more, and better than 100Hz tvs, like the Samsung 46D5005 beside it on the showroom tv-wall.I placed myself about 10 feet from the tvs in the showroom, at the same distance I have to the tv in my living room, and compared the different brands pictures, and this Sony had more natural colours than the Samsungs, LGs and Philips tvs in the same price range or up to 1/3 more.This Sony is a 50Hz, but it had better picture overall than the Samsung 100HZ as mentioned, and just as good picture overall as a Philips 100Hz costing 1/3 more. Sony has right, the non glare screen give less reflections than clear glass screens, and combined with the natural colours, deep black and good contrast, it gives a very nice picture to look at.The cable tv box I have give Standard Definiton, SD, pictures on all channels, so I asked specificially about seeing the tv in the showroom with SD format, and I am happy to say the picture processor in this tv presents this format just as good as more expensive tvs, and HD format  are presented stunningly well.Watching a tennis match on Eurosport in SD, convinced me that the motion interpolation of the 100Hz tvs is not something I will miss, this tvs overall picture quality is so good that I and some others in the showroom agreed it was just as comfortable or better to watch as 100Hz tvs beside it on the wall.I ordered the tv as you have guessed, and it was swiftly delivered the same evening.Unpacking and assembly:The quality of Sony is appearent in material quality, fit and finish, and and everything in the box was carefully packaged, and the instruction manual made the assembly easy, the parts fit excellently. An allen wrench in enclosed to the screws for the stand, tighten the screws firmly. Tip:-keep a philips screwdriver handy, the screws to fasten the stand to the backside of the tv panel require a screwdriver with a Philips head, this screwdriver is not enclosed. There are pilot guides on the backside of the panel, so the tv panel slides down into the stand, just tighten the 3 screws with the screwdriver.Mounted on its stand the Sony Bravia has a elegant, timeless design, even the picture quality and functions are the most important of course, it is a bonus when the tv looks good, it is a big part of the living rooms interior.Connections:From my cable tv box there is a scart cable to connect to the tv, and the quality of the Sony is appearent here, nothing gives when the connector is pressed into its place, this is a sturdy tv set.Setting up:The set up procedure is automatic, and it is easy to follow the on screen instructions, the menus are intuitive, and quick to use. Tip: when you have a cable tv box with built in tuner, just press forward on the set up procedure, and press the AV button on the upper left on the remote, select AV1 or one of the HDMI ports if your cable tv box is connected there, the port is checked when it is connected, and press OK.I am happy to report that the picture quality is as excellent as it was in the showroom, this is a LED tv with edge lit, but the black is very black, even from the edges, friends say the quality of the picture is among the best they have seen on LED tvs, so I could not have asked for more of a tv picture.The remote:This is one strong remote. I do not have to aim it on the tvs IR sensor to use it, it can just lay on the couch beside me, and even with the coffee table with books and magazines between it and the tv, the tv responds, even if I aim the remote at the window panes behind me, in the opposite direction of the tv,  the tv responds, as I said, a strong remote, very convenient and comfortable to use.I miss a energy saving screen saver button on the remote, to reach the picture-off feature, so you hear the sound only, you have to dig into some menus and sub menus, with a few times practice, it takes just under 10 seconds, but I recommend Sony to have a direct button for this on the remote.Internet features:This Sony Bravia KDL-46EX520 model have WiFi ready feature, you add the WiFi adapter form Sony, the BR100, and just attach it to the upper USB port. There is also a cable connection on the backside of the tv panel for A LAN cable.  My router, a fairly recent model, has the convenient WPS button, which make it able to have a secure connection setup with the tv with just one press on the button on the router, very easy setup for this one. The tv also has a built in web browser, it is not as fast as on your computer, and with no flash, but usable.I have used the Internet features for while, I like to watch National Geograpic space videos and Hubble Cast on YouTube, and it is very good for this, despite the YouTube videos has a low 480p video format. I have not used the Skype yet, but downloading videos is easier  and faster than I expected, but of course not at all so fast as from your computer.With the internet connection, you can enjoy automatic downloading of software updates from Sony, I have been told Sony send updates for their tvs for several years, and not just for this years model, another reason I am glad I choose Sony.Energy consumption:The EU energy label in the box said 68 Watts in normal use, and that is good for a 46\" LED tv set, this estimate is usally in good measure, so it probably use less than 60 Watts on the average.Value:Sony tvs is typically a bit more expensive then the tv sets from the other brands it is natural to compare it with, worth it too, because they are of better quality overall, but I think the price on this one is very good. You get a lot for your Money with this model, and is it so obvious that Sony is a quality brand, it is appearant in every detail, this tv set is very good value I think, and with the longevity of LED lit, about 100000 hours, and low energy consumption, it is excellent value.Verdict:After two weeks of use, I will with no hesitation warmly recommend this tv. If you want a 46\"tv with no 3D feature, with very good picture quality in SD and HD format, and with internet features like web browser, and downloading of videos and movies, you cannot go wrong with selecting this exellent tv.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing tv", "Author": "Ima B Nerd", "ReviewID": "R2RZEL0ZA236EE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Did not purchase this television from Amazon.com)I just received this television and wow, I am just unbelievably impressed.  I have seen many Edge Lit LED TV's before, and this blows them away.

The picture is good and appears uniform.  My main concern about the TV was the audio quality.  The thin LED edge lit displays don't allow for much speaker space.  We placed the TV in our den and did not want to hook up a separate sound bar or stereo.  I listened to an older version of the same TV in the store and thought the audio quality was a bit better than its competitors.  The sound quality has more bass and depth than I thought and is totally acceptable for casual TV/movie watching or running Pandora through the internet applications.The bezel is thin and the TV is totally inconspicous in the room.  The TV is rather low, the bottom of the screen is only about 2.5-3\" from ground, compared to our other 46\" Samsung which sits about 6\" from the table surface.I would definately recommend this TV, very satisfied.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "RICH", "ReviewID": "RICYJT4JLVH59", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got one of these yesterday...and all I can say is WOW! For 9 years all I had was a 51\" Panasonic rear projection screen TV. This blows it away with just a standard dvd I played on it last night. And the USB input makes viewing pictures and videos off of flash drives or external hard drives just awesome...Going to hook up my new PS3 as well and try out some games and bluray stuff next...So far I'm impressed at the clarity and not having to adjust the set like the old rear projection screens!", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "A good TV for the price", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "RA64COCC2LORO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, I'm happy with this TV. I wouldn't call myself a videophile, but the picture quality is quite good to my eyes. Although it's an edge lit LCD, I see no signs of flashlighting, clouding, etc. The black is quite consistant. I had been a bit concerned about buying an edge lit, but I'm glad I did. There aren't as many color controls as on some models, but it should be good enough for most. The audio is OK - nothing special. Bass isn't as strong as I'd like. But I had planned to hook it up to my stereo, so no big loss there for me. Netflix works pretty well. The interface isn't quite as slick as my xbox, but I do find myself using it. Pandora works well, though it locked up once on me. Youtube works well too. There are plenty of inputs. It doesn't support wifi w/o an adapter, but I knew that before I bought, and have it hardwired. DLNA support is pretty good. I have streamed a few movies from my ReadyNas without problems.A few things that annoyed me:1) I had seen in several places references to this TV supporting Sony Internet Widgets. Some references (including Sony's website) said it supported them, and some said it would some time in April. As of now (late May, 2011), it does NOT. These are different than Netflix,Pandora, Youtube, etc, which work fine. I've had at least two firmware updates since I hooked the TV up, but still no widgets. <Update>This came in an update back around June - I never use them.2) The user interface isn't very consistant - there are two or three interfaces hobbled together. The main interface is pretty slick, but it used a different one with a different background for Internet video - the colors used don't really work well together. The interface for the video looks like that from my BlueRay player, so I think they just reused it without a re-skin.3) Web browsing is useless. The controls are clunky, it's slow, and on a big page, it can run out of memory. There's no flash support.4)  The latest HDMI specs support controlling components over HDMI. Sony claims support (they call it \"Sync\") but ONLY for sony products. I can control my BlueRay, but not my non-sony stereo. This isn't a huge loss either, since I'm using a Harmony remote, but others might be more annoying to others.5) (Not Sony's fault) Harmony doesn't support this TV yet (or didn't as of February) - I set it up as a EX500 instead, but had to add a LOT of custom buttons.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Sunny NZ", "ReviewID": "R729R9XCZSVTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it.

The setup was easy.  Please note that the HDMI on the side of the TV is #2 (somewhat illogical).  The color and 120 Hz refresh rate is great.

That means no TV purchased outside these few countries can even be set up to try to use Netflix (regardless of Netflix's licensing issues).  Essentially, the only thing such an Internet TV can do is show YouTube clips on the screen, and absolutely nothing else.  So if you were thinking of streaming movies from the internet to your \"Internet TV,\" don't bother buying one of these TV's in a foreign country, because it's just a waste of money.  Save your money and buy a non-Internet TV, and you'll get the same functionality.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazed!!!", "Author": "Bradley", "ReviewID": "R2D1VEDHJMHZZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best TV I have ever owned!  The size is perfect, the colors are rich, the blacks are deep, and the motion is sharp.  Comparing it to my 40-inch Samsung this beauty blows it away in ever aspect.  So much so that my wife (who hardly even watches TV) already wants to purchase a second Sony to replace the Samsung.If you are familiar with the menu of the Playstation 3 then you'll be right at home with this TV.  The menu is very similar.  All the options are laid out well and it is a breeze to navigate.  The remote is also similar to the PS3 remote.We are video game players at my house, so watching Arkham City, Skyrim, and Uncharted 3 on this thing is amazing!  Easy to get soaked in.  We mounted it on the wall using the VideoSecu Tilt TV Wall Mount Bracket for Most 32\"- 65\" LED LCD Plasma TV Flat Panel Screen Free HDMI Cable and Magnetic Bubble Level MF607B 1QH $25 wall mount sold on Amazon and it works perfectly.  The TV's design is very sleek and the screen is pitch black so it looks as though it was meant to be hung up.  If you decide to use a stand, the stand is included and requires a tiny amount of installation.In my opinion, this TV is perfect!  Probably one of the best investments I've ever made.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Television", "Author": "Thomas Raven", "ReviewID": "R3643U4XI9TWW0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was a little tentative about buying a TV online, but I decided to take the plunge and I'm very happy with the product.  I don't see how the picture could get much better.  It's stunning and there are enough variable settings to satisfy the pickiest viewer.  I had read that some edgelit LED TVs have inconsistent backlighting, but that isn't evident here.  The TV is unbelievably thin and lightweight too.  I've hung framed prints that were heavier.The sound quality leaves a lot to be desired but I already had a sound system so that really didn't matter to me.  If you're planning on using the internal speakers, you might want to go and listen first.The internet apps are pretty cool, but as is the case with a lot of Sony products, they're all over the map.  I use the YouTube, Netflix, Crackle, & Amazon Video apps the most.  The others are mostly just menu fillers.Setup was a breeze except for one thing.  I use an OTA antenna to receive local channels and I couldn't get the TV to \"see\" the CBS affiliate in LA.  I knew that it was close enough to be received as I had another TV before this one that received it very well, but I couldn't force the TV to find it in its channel scan.  Even going to the digital channel manually didn't work.  I eventually loked up the actual physical channel (LA channel 2.1 is actually transmitted over channel 43.1 since the digital upgrade and the code that's supposed to tell the TV that 43.5 is channel 2 apparently does't work for Sony.  It worked on my Sharp Aquos, but not on this TV and that gave me some headaches before I figured it out.  CBS2 is now permanently on channel 43.1 on my TV.My only other issue is with the stand.  It leans very slightly to the left.  VERY slightly, but it's enough that I can notice it.  I may be able to straighten it out, but I haven't been successful so far.The remote is laid out a little oddly, but I think I'll get used to it.  I was surprised to find out that the remote will control my Sony blu ray player through the HDMI connection.  Very cool.  The TV even switches to the BR input automatically whenever I turn on the player.Despite the couple of issues, I think this TV represents the best bang for the buck on the market today and I'm very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "Charles A.
