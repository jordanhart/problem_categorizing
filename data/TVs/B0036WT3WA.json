{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lots of screen for the price", "Author": "R. Merz", "ReviewID": "R22Q0OV21QUMJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung PN50C450I picked up my PN50C450 on Friday March 19th from BestBuy after months of research.  In general I don't make purchases from BestBuy.  I did the \"purchase online / pick up in store\" option and was very satisfied (I avoid sales people whenever possible :>).  Sorry for the long review but it took me 4-5 months of research to pull the trigger on this TV.  Here are my impressions.Setup Instructions on the box for removing the TV were clear.  After a quick look at the assembly instructions (and sending my kids upstairs to play for 20 minutes) I screwed on the mounting bracket to the base.  Just as I read on other reviews these screws did NOT go in easy.  Samsung needs to address this as it doesn't instill confidence in the product when the first step in assembly has a minor glitch.  Had a bit of a time getting the TV to lineup with the bracket (my issue not the TV).  Put in the last 4 screws in the back and those went in much easier.  Took a step back and looked at it, \"dude that thing is huge\" (large smile on my face)Power OnNow the moment of truth......IS IT GOING TO BUZZ? I powered it on and........not a sound to be heard... totally silent!  For a second I thought maybe I didn't power it on but the little \"musical tone\" went off indicating that it was on.  This was my #1 concern with all the things I read about buzzing.  Maybe I got lucky, maybe I just can't hear a buzz or maybe it's not as much as an issue as everyone keeps saying? Sure, I stuck my head behind the TV over the next few days and really tried to listen for a buzzing sound.  I found if I got on a stool and put my ear really close to the top of the TV (careful it gets hot) I could hear the sound of \"electricity\" same as my old CRT TV.  IN SHORT NO BUZZING.Connecting StuffHDMI: After some research about the whole HDMI controversy (Monster vs cheap cable) Cnet put everything in perspective for me, \"it's digital, just get the cheapest cable you can find\".  Believe it or not BigLots had a gold plated 6'  HDMI cable for $12.00 (BestBuy's least expensive was $29.99).  So I picked up one HDMI cable, 4 cans of diced tomatoes, yellow mustard and a 6 pack of root beer (God Bless America).I connected the HDMI to my U-verse box and immediately went to the first HD channel I could find.  I then switch to the corresponding SD channel and flipped back and forth several times. It's a big difference between SD and HD (although my kids and my wife didn't seem to care, but they have not yet given into HD madness).I then connected my Wii with the standard cables it came with.  The picture was obviously not HD but that was to be expected with the Wii.  PQ was fine for gaming.  The new Super Mario Brothers is way more fun (4 player mode) when you have so much digital real-estate to play on.  I'm going to pick up a set of component cables just as a few people at AVS forum recommended .  Overall the PQ was fine for gaming.I don't have a Blu-Ray player yet so I did a test with my DVD player.  Movies looked good after fussing with the screen size settings.  I know Blu-ray DVD up scaling will be a significant improvement.I also need to pick up an antenna so I can get OTA HD channels.  From what I've read the OTA signal is not compressed (like my U-verse signal) so I'm excited to see what kind of results I can get.TV Viewing and SettingsRight out of the box in \"Standard Mode\" the picture looked kind of dark and the colors were kind of flat.  I then scrolled through to \"Movie\" mode.  That was much better but still the colors were not super impressive.  Then I switch to \"Dynamic\".....who the heck came up with this setting?  Very bright and colors looked like a carnival.  Unfortunately \"dynamic\" is the mode for choice for my kids when they play the Wii.  I guess that would be the only time you would need this setting?In order to get the best picture I took the advice of many of you and tweaked the movie mode settings.  Thank you [...] users for posting the custom settings.  They worked great!!  I think I still need to bump down the skin tone setting one more notch but I'm very happy with the way it looks.There is a lot of talk about Black Lines, Screen Doors, Dither etc..... I don't seem to have any of these issues (maybe ignorance is bliss?).  I do get a little pixilation on HD channels sometimes but I think that has more to do with my HD signal being compressed (thanks AT&T;).Glare: I have the TV in a corner of our room that has a window flanking the left of the TV and a sliding glass door facing from the other room.  Sure you get some glare in the middle of the day but if you just draw the curtains (and I'm not talking about black-out shades, just normal curtains) its fine.  At certain angles at night I can see a lamp or kitchen light reflecting on the screen.  I've found that most lights have these things called switches which allow you to turn them on/off.  That seems to solve the problem :>)Image Burn/retention: This was another major concern I had prior to purchasing plasma in general.  I've come to the conclusion that as long as you don't spend 5 hours straight playing COD4 with the brightness up to 100, image burn is not an issue.  I'd say our family is average when it comes to TV use.  We've played the Wii and watched movies/TV and over the last week I have never seen any indication of image burn (and trust me I've been looking for it).  And NO I didn't run any break in DVD's either.Sound: With the way people complain about the sound I thought it was going to be like listening to the TV via a tin can and string.  Do the speakers compare to a separate surround sound system running from a receiver....NO.  Are you going to hear chest thumping bass when you watch a movie...NO.  Relax people, the sound on the TV is just fine.  All of my u-verse TV viewing is done exclusively via the TV speakers right now.  I watched a concert the other night and I thought it sounded great.  The Wii and DVD are currently running through my receiver and 5 speakers and yes it sounds better through that. But that is to be expected.General PQ:  The real test was last Sunday night when Discovery showed their LIFE series.  The whole family sat down to watch our new Plasma.  It was ideal viewing with a pitch black room (it felt just like a movie theater) I actually heard one of my kids gasp because it looked so real.  My youngest wasn't too happy with all the HD close ups of bugs and kept his hands over his eyes because it looked too real.  I personally couldn't believe how clear the picture was.  I'm finding out that not all HD channels are the same.  Some have great HD and some are so/so.  That's more of the fault of u-verse and the compression they use on their HD channels.  But after watching that I was sold!!!!  I know that Blu-ray is going to be even better than this experience.  720P: When I was in BestBuy this TV was right next to a 1080P TV and you could see a little bit more details when you were 2-3' away.  But at 8-9' (my TV viewing) I couldn't see the difference.  NON ISSUE FOR ME.  But how are the Blacks you ask?: wouldn't you know that the blacks look......well.....black (not grey).  Very happy.Gripes: I use my u-verse remote to watch TV.  I only use the Samsung remote to switch inputs or change the screen setting.  The Samsung remote is about as responsive as molasses in January.  I'm not sure where they put the stupid sensor for the TV but it must be under the base.  Switching from SD to HD shows and visa/versa and dealing with the different screen formats is a pain.  HD looks great in 16:9 but then the SD shows are not full screen so you have to flip \"fit to screen\" to fix that.  All of this screen gymnastics is getting old.  I wish there was a setting to say, \"hello TV...just fill the screen for me to give me the best possible picture\".  Swivel would be nice as it takes 2 people to \"swivel\" the TV manually.  Since I don't have the component cables for my Wii I have to swap the DVD and Wii between the 1 in-put that supports them.  I wish it had 1 more set of composite connections on the side.  For now that's about it.Conclusion:  So far I love this TV.  The only issue now is competing for screen time between the Kids/wife.  I'm glad I got the 50\" as I know I would not have been happy with the 42\".  For the price I don't think you can go wrong with this TV.Update 6/10/10:  I've had the TV for almost 3 months now and I am still enjoying it very much.  For the most part I think it's \"broken in\" now.  I did have to tweak some of my initial setting from when I got it.  I did purchase a component cable for my Wii and it looks much better with the new cable.  I really didn't have any issues with IR.  Once in a while when my kids would go on a Wii binge you could see some IR but running the scrolling feature for a few min took care of that quick.  I don't have a blu-ray player yet but the HD quality for AT&T; U-verse is pretty good. Still no buzzing (never had an issue with mine).  I did hook up a usb flash drive to it to view some pictures I put on it.  Wow! it does a great job displaying pictures.I'll report back when I get a Blu-ray player (maybe fathers day???).", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "great tv for the money", "Author": "Jason K", "ReviewID": "R3LG7G5MUVPDXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this tv on sale the day after it arrived in stores for only $720 and I could not be happier with it.  The picture is fantastic right out of the box.  As with all plasmas, make sure you take the break in period seriously by turning down the contrast and brightness a bit for the first 100-200 hours.  I've also been running the anti-burn in scrolling feature for about an hour a night when I go to bed and have yet to notice any sort of image retention although I haven't played any video games on it yet.There's a lot of chatter about these Samsung plasmas having an annoying buzzing sound coming from them but I have yet to notice it.  Maybe I just got lucky with mine but it runs very quietly.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Budget HDTV - very pleased", "Author": "D. Bryant", "ReviewID": "R2UTTLHU1BG4TC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this set at Best Buy for $719 + tax about 1 week ago and have been very happy with it thus far.  I'm not gonna lie, I was hesitant to go the 720p route; I don't want to be the one paying to be at the front of the tech curve, but I also don't want to be the one purchasing something that is soon to be obsolete.  Luckily, our Best Buy had this 50' set at $719, the Samsung 50' 1080 plasma step up at $1300, and a 46' 8000? series edge-lit LED LCD Samsung at $2100 all side by side for easy comparison. The comparison ended up making my decision easier.Picture - all in store picture settings so probably not apples to apples, but I noticed considerably more sharpness in the LCD than either of the two plasmas.  However, colors looked deeper and \"popped\" more on both of the plasmas vs the LCD. The 1080p plasma unit was a tad sharper than the c450, particularly noticeable when viewing up-close and when it showed black lettering on a white background. You could see a smoother edge on the lettering in the 1080p set at close distances. In my home, broadcast HDTV (I use an antenna for locals, I do not have cable/dish) looks fantastic on the c450.  Analog signals even look passable, and better than my 32 in Vizio LCD.  I do not yet have a Blu-ray player; a PS3 is in my near future, but I do hook up a PC to the TV occasionally (Hulu,etc is my cheap cable).  How the PC and blu-ray would look were my main 720p vs 1080p concerns. The PC looks great; I expect no problems with blu-ray.  Regular DVD looks fine.  I relied on multiple professional and private reviews noting that the difference between 720 and 1080p is minimal at a 50' size, unless you are close (less than 8 feet)to the set.  If you are sitting beyond 8 to 10 feet the extra lines of resolution are virtually imperceptible to the naked eye.  You will have some techies swear to the grave that this is not the case, but use your eyes, not the specs to decide.  Bottom line: some 1080p sets look great; some 720p sets look great. The bigger in size you go, the more 1080p will distance itself from 720p, all other things being equal. Somewhere between 42 to 50 in, the 1080 difference begins to become noticeable. For me, the extra $600 for a comparable 1080p at this size was not worth it.  For some, it is. I'd give the picture a 4/5.  I was perfectly happy with the picture on my 32 in Vizio LCD; now it looks below avg to poor in comparison.Glass - one of the biggest negatives of the c450 is the highly reflective screen; probably a driver of the lower price point and the fact that its plasma.  Its glass is highly reflective; more so than the 1080p plasma was in-store and like a mirror compared to the LCD.  Turn off the sets when you compare and you'll see the stark difference.  Think about where your putting your TV.  My den gets below average sunlight.  The outside light source comes from behind the TV, but it still casts some reflection on the screen in the day time.  I have a lamp across from it and it just should never be turned on while you are watching TV; causes way too much reflection.  If you have a lot of windows in your room, you may want to look at another TV option rather than the C450. My sister has an older 50' HP plasma with a wall of windows opposite of it and its almost unwatchable during the day.  In a dark room, it is not a concern and the glass gives a crispness to the picture that the LCD matte finishes don't, IMO.  Overall, glass is a 3/5 but don't push it in a room with a lot of light.Styling - I put this TV on a side wall in my den and the side of the TV is seen when you walk in, so styling was a factor for me. I wanted as thin as possible within my budget.  The C450 is a 2.7 in deep 50 in HDTV; one of the thinner standard width sets you will find (3.5-4' more common)  Between the three sets I directly compared, the 8000 series won this category again with 1.2' thickness, and a sharp looking glass edge trimming the monitor.  However, the c450 and the 1080p plasma both have a nice looking, relatively thin, profile as well.  I do wish that the c450 was trimmed in a matte, rather than a glossy finish.  The glossy finish is reflective.  Overall, i'd give styling a 4/5.  5/5 at this price point.Inputs - The C450 has 3 HDMI's, 2 component, pc input, USB port for media viewing.  See the Amazon specs for the complete input listing.  It does not have an S-video input, but one of the component inputs doubles as an RCA jack, so if you have multiple older components to hook up, you could use an RCA splitter.  IMO, if you're in the market for an HDTV and still have alot of older non HDTV components, save some money, go less expensive on the HDTV and buy some new components.  The picture upgrade you'll get from new components is far more beneficial than what you'll get from a higher end HDTV.  Enough inputs for me and it gets a bonus for multiple component inputs.  Most just have 1.Value - Price was a big and probably the primary consideration for me; winner hands down; el cheapo C450. Ultimately, you give up some features, but I did not see enough picture quality and feature differences to justify the jump to the 1080p plasma at $600 more.  Good value, good picture for your buck.  Definitely a 5/5 regarding overall value.Other items-No internet apps.  Was a consideration for me, but underwhelming reviews ultimately made it a non factor.Remote - the c450 remote is average at best.  Its infared, and not super responsive. Keys are not backlit.Menus - orderly menu system, decent channel guide, relatively robust picture quality controls, including white balance, and multiple auto and sensor driven brightness options.  Buzzing problem - my c450 does not buzz...there is what I would call some very high frequency electronic noise, maybe this is what people have complained about.  I have a relatively small room, listen at low volume levels, and it has not been a factor for me.TV Stand - screws did not want to go in straight no matter what I did; after 30 minutes messing around with a screwdriver, I used my drill and hoped for the best; they worked their way through the hitch in the threads and fastened.  Stand does not swivel like some, and TV does not seem overly sturdy.  Comes with a cord to fasten to the TV and screw in the wall to help keep it from tipping.EDIT #1:  I am noticing significant picture judder, in certain situations.  Several specific commercials during the NCAA tournament, as well as live action.  At first I thought it was my signal as I am using an antenna, but it happened consistently at the same time during the same commercials each time they aired as I was watching bball.  I have experienced this on both NBC and CBS; both broadcast in 1080i.  I have not experienced this on Fox or ABC who broadcast in 720p.  I'm guessing it is a scaling/upconverting issue.  Anyone else have any thoughts on this?  Samsung customer service was no help.  Best Buy wasn't either, other than they said I could return it.  I'm contemplating that option, but I really like the TV otherwise.  I'm hesitant to purchase another C450. I'm not sure if it is a defective processor, or just a side effect of a processor that isn't always up to the scaling task.EDIT #2:  Due to the aforementioned judder issues on 1080i signals, I took the C450 back to Best Buy yesterday.  I ordered another and will post an update once it gets here later this week.  The picture quality for the buck was second to none.  It even dropped to $699 and I got $20 back with the order.  Hopefully, the judder issues will be gone, and I do not get a \"buzzer\".  My first one did not have a buzzing issue.  Samsung has not completely remedied the buzzing problem on their plasmas per several other reviews I have read.  It appears to be a hit or miss problem.EDIT #3:  After nearly a month on my second model, the judder issues are still present on CBS which is broadcasting in a 1080i signal.  It seems to get worse if I have \"Film\" mode on, as well as darker and/or fast moving scenes.  However, it seems to be primarily limited to that one channel, so I'm once again wondering if its a channel signal issue. I'm perplexed to say the least.  But, I've decided to keep the television, as the picture quality for the price is unmatched in my opinion.", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Good TV", "Author": "Dana McCann", "ReviewID": "R1TF1NZ4BYPRSA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i purchased this TV at Fry's Electronics in Houston, Texas the day that it came out. First off, I already own a Westinghouse 42 inch LCD, a 32 inch Sharp Aquos, and another Samsung 32 inch that I have in my daughters room. I thought that I was seeing the very best that I could until I purchased this television. I really and truly didn't go into Frys' to buy anything, yet when I saw the price I thought why not, I wanted a larger screen for the den anyway, and if I don't like it I can always return it. I want to say that I wish I could return the other 3 sets that I have. The colors are absolutely beautiful right out of the box. I could not believe how much that I had been missing when watching movies and Bluray. I am a member of Bluray.com, AVSFORUM, HIDEF, Sound and Vision Etc. I have researched LCD, LED, PLasma, DLP, so on and so forth. My family has an entourage of Samsung products. This 720P set blows them away. I can discern the difference between the 1080 and 720 at about 3 feet. I sit 10 feet away from the screen, and I can tell you the only thing that I have seen with my own eyes better than this, after spending countless hours at MODA and other Home Theatre stores from Houston, Texas to College, Station Texas is the likes of the Pioneer Elite and the line up from Panasonic Plasmas' that best this set. This is an entry level Plasma, without all of the bells and whistles that gives you a beautiful picture every time you turn it on. Now for the cons: the higher the contrast, you hear the buzz, but only when you are not using a surround sound system. Does it have Netflix, etc? No, I can get that over my PS3 and my Xbox 360, Does it have PIP? No, I get that with DirecTv. I am completely satisfied with my purchase. Oh, forgot to mention that it comes with the 3D sync out, so all I have to add is a transmitter,the glasses and wait for the Sony PS3 3d update, and I'll be watching movies in 3D by early summer. Now how do you like that for a budget TV?", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best TV For The Money & I'd Buy It Again Tomorrow!", "Author": "Twins Daddy \"Dennis\"", "ReviewID": "R1SLXPZ90ZDNJD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this Samsung to replace an aging Panasonic TH-50PX60U 50-Inch Plasma HDTV that weighs 93.7lbs and consumes 515 watts of power and this new one IS an upgrade!

Besides uncomfortably heating our family room, the old Panny was costing us 3.5 TIMES more on our electric bill than this new Sammy!

I found a couple of video settings I like posted at avsforum. The user who posted them recommends a Standard setting for normal daytime use and a Movie setting for watching movies at night.

There are lots of settings posted by various members and they're a good starting place for dialing in the picture that looks perfect to you. The picture quality is really, really good on both SD and HD with a DirecTV signal feed. I have no complaints about the picture other than having to dial it in to suit your eyes. Once you do that, it's done until you do a firmware upgrade with a USB flash drive. So remember to WRITE DOWN your video settings before doing any update to the firmware.UPDATE: BREAK-IN PERIOD - There is some debate over whether or not \"newer\" Samsung Plasma TVs require a 100hr (up to 250hr) break-in period. You can read more at samsungplasmatvfaq.com, although some of the info seems a bit dated. I suggest using the tools they give you with the TV under Screen Burn Protection, particularly Pixel Shift and Scrolling. I've also cut down the brightness, contrast and dynamic contrast settings I posted above until I have about 150 hours on the set. Better to be safe than sorry I suppose..Some Samsung plasma owners have reported a buzzing sound, but there is not one with our new set. This unit was made in Mexico in August 2010 and there is absolutely NO BUZZING sound at all. If I mute the TV sound, I can't even tell if the TV is on or off without looking at it. It simply can't get any quieter than that!The only downside is the speakers. The old Panny had front-firing speakers that we found to be quite sufficient for our needs. This Sammy has them mounted on the bottom and toward the REAR of the set. This is just ridiculous. I suppose it has something to do with trying to project \"3D\" sound...But I don't know anyone who sits behind their TV set to watch it. And where we place our plasma in the family room further complicates the sound issue so that it's mainly \"trapped\" behind the set. The setup menu provides many ways to customize the sound (just like with the video display)...But I haven't found an acceptable one yet because there's only so much you can do when the sound is trapped behind the unit. I might end up getting a soundbar and placing it in front (where the TV's speakers should be in the first place). But I also don't want to spend more on a soundbar than this 50\" plasma, if you know what I mean. Besides, nobody else in our home is complaining about the sound so maybe I'll just get used to it too...UPDATE: I played around with the sound settings and found one I think I can learn to like:Mode: Custom100Hz -__________*____+300Hz -_________*_____+_1Khz -________*______+_3Khz -_______*_______+10Khz -_______*_______+SRS: OnAuto Vol: OnThis sound setting seems to work well where we have our set placed. Your ears may like it too, or they may not. That's the nice thing about having controls to adjust the sound to your liking. Keep playing with it and you'll probably find a video and sound setting that's good for you. Then you can sit back and enjoy your new 50\" plasma!!Only one more thing to do and that is get an extended warranty. I bought a MACK warranty on eBay for our Sony HD camcorder that I've had to use twice already and it has more than paid for itself. There's currently a 5-yr MACK warranty listed for only $89.95 that applies to this set (<$750 purchase price). Samsung provides a 1-yr parts AND labor warranty for this set, which is very good. The 5-yr extended warranty kicks in after that first year and provides 6 total years of in-home service for less than $100. Knowing how we've already had to use our ext warranty for our HD camcorder, this kind of ext protection is something you should seriously consider when purchasing something like a new HDTV.We're lovin' our new Sammy 50\" plasma.

The picture is gorgeous, comparing it to a CRT is like comparing Jessica Alba to, well, a rock. This picture is so much better that it cannot be compared to CRT picture quality. The TV itself was easy to install on the stand, and once it was set up and hooked up, I found the menus to be easily navigable. Personally, I tried to use my electronic expertise to go at it without the manual, that didn't work. Thankfully the manual had an easy to find fix for my stupidity.

Last year we bought a 46\" Panasonic plasma TV.  I returned it a few days later because we couldn't get the picture bright enough without looking washed out.  I'm thinking that we got a lemon because I hear a lot of good things about Panasonic TVs.  So our search began again this year.  We really wanted a 1080p TV but with newer technology coming out all the time, we didn't want to be stuck with an expensive TV that is outdated three years from now.About a month ago Amazon put the Samsung PN42C450 42-Inch 720p Plasma HDTV (Black) on sale for $449 so we jumped on it.  Delivery was scheduled for 10am to 2pm and finally came at 9pm.  I wasn't impressed with the shippers but the TV arrived undamaged.  I attached the TV base myself and put the TV on the entertainment stand.  The base attaches with 10 self-tapping screws but it was easy with my powered driver and a 6\" #2 phillips bit.  Turned the TV on and it looked great.  The TV comes with three different picture modes: standard, movie & dynamic.  You can adjust them however you like.  Each TV input retains its own settings for each picture mode.  For example, standard on HDMI1 can be different from standard on HDMI2 or HDMI3.  That's nice because you can have different settings for each device connected to the TV.  We use the picture modes to adjust for day and night time viewing.  There's a dark red stripe at the bottom edge of the TV frame.  You hardly notice it unless you're looking for it.  The TV controls are on the front right side of the frame.  They are built into the plastic frame and are seamless.  You don't depress a button but just touch it.  We like it because it looks sleek but it can be difficult to see the controls.  We normally use the remote but it's nice to have an alternative option if you can't find the remote.  Speaking of the remote...it's easy to use but big.  We also found it doesn't work very well unless you point it directly at the TV sensor.  I bought a Logitech Harmony 650 universal remote and it works ten times better than the Samsung remote.  The sound quality is pretty good for a TV.  The TV is about 10 pounds lighter than the 2009 model.The day after we received the PN42C450, Amazon dropped the price of Samsung PN50C450 50-Inch 720p Plasma HDTV (Black) from $699 to $499.  For $50 more we could have a 50\" TV instead so we bought it and the 42\" went back.  The 50\" is identical to the 42\" but bigger.  Same remote, same controls, same red stripe, same sound and picture quality.  (FYI: All 720p 42\" plasmas have a resolution of 1024 x 768.  This is a 4:3 ratio.  To make it a wide screen, they stretch the pixels out 1/3 wider than they are tall.  This makes the TV have a 16:9 ratio picture.  You would think that by stretching the pixels out that it would be noticeable while watching the TV.  We were impressed because we couldn't tell the difference.  The picture looked normal to us.  Most 720p 50\" plasmas have a resolution of approximately 1365 x 768.  This is already a 16:9 ratio so the pixels are square.)  They shaved off almost 20 pounds from last year's 50\" model.Everyone talks about the Samsung plasma TVs having a buzz.  Both of our TVs had a quiet buzz.  I can hear it but it's not enough to bother me.  From what I've read, the higher your altitude the louder the buzz can be in a plasma TV.  We're at 1200 feet.Next subject is the glare.  Both TVs are like a dark mirror.  We have a bright living room.  The windows are behind the TV but light reflecting off the back walls make it difficult to see the TV picture during the day until around 4pm when the sun is moving towards the other side of the house.  At night with the lights off, the picture quality is awesome.  The 50\" did better than the 42\" with glare issue because it affected a smaller portion of the overall TV picture.  We considered an LCD TV but we have little ones that can't keep their hands or objects in their hands off the TV.  I've never seen them do it but I can see smudges on the screen.  An LCD screen can be scratched easily while a plasma screen is made out of glass (hence the glare) and is more scratch resistant.  I also don't like the \"soap opera effect\" on the LCD TVs (it doesn't bother my wife much).720p vs 1080p.  I can see a difference between the 1080p and 720p TVs in the stores with a high quality input source.  But the quality of 720p is still very good.  A 720p broadcast on a 1080p TV is not going to look any better than a 720p TV.Power usage is hard to measure as it is bouncing all over the place as the TV picture changes brightness.  Picture settings also affect the power usage.  The 42\" used roughly 100 watts on a medium setting while the 50\" used about 150 watts.  On our night time settings the 50\" would average about 90-100 watts and could peak to 250 watts on the default dynamic settings.Burn-in issues?  Well we haven't had any in the few weeks we've had either TV.  We have had image retention though.  I connected my computer to the 50\" for about 30 minutes and it took a couple of hours of TV watching for the image retention to fully dissipate.  Yes, I have the pixel shifting enabled.  We've had some other image retention but it always goes away from just watching TV.One thing I love about the Samsung TVs is that the on-screen volume display is on the left side.  Our old Sony TV had it at the bottom and it would often cover up words or subtitles on the screen.Overall, we were very happy with both Samsung TVs.  If you are on a budget, then I wouldn't let the 720p deter you.  If you have a very bright room and you watch a lot of daytime TV, then you might be happier with an LCD TV.  Bigger is better.  We thought the 42\" was perfect till we got the 50\".  After watching the 50\" for a couple of weeks it would be hard to go back to a 42\".", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cant beat this TV for the price", "Author": "E. Gerardi", "ReviewID": "R28VUGRGVL8ZHR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV on Black Friday and held off writing a review until i had some time on the TV. Here is my review1) The TV price is just unbeatable for what you get. Plasma TV have THE ABSOLUTE BEST picture i have seen on any TV.2) Picture Quality on this TV even though its 720p is OUTSTANDING. I completely enjoy watching movies now!! I used to have a 42 inch rear projection TV so you can imagine the difference. I dont have 1080p offered on my Verizon FiOS yet so i am not missing out on any extra picture quality since 1080i is the same as 720p.3) Overall look and feel is great. I like the bezel with the red lip on it and i think the controls are pretty self explanatory.4) Recommend making sure you \"break-in\" the TV for at least 100 hours. I know that most people may disagree with this but i found it to be the best thing in order to get very minimal Image Retention. There is also a great calibration post that has been written here that i used and the picture looks amazing. I switch between Standard for sports and Movie for movies.5) I found the sound to be great. I keep my TV at around 11 and its really load.6) I hear a faint bussing but its not enough to really even worry about. You have to be right up to the TV to hear it and even then its not that load. This is a total non issue.7) i have been playing games on the TV and not used the Game mode yet. I keep it in Standard mode and the viewing is pretty good. Some games are pretty dark and in the day tough to see since the TV reflects a lot of light.Along with all these great points also come the negatives. Here is what i found to be some of the issues.1) Image Retention is a bitch especially if you have kids. The issue is that you have to be aware of channels that are not full width for the Tv and have those black boxes on the edges. Most cartoon channels are like this. IF your kids watch a lot of TV, you will get this Image Retention on the sides for a while. It goes away but you still see it for a bit and its distracting2) Be careful of those pesky station identifiers in the lower right hand corner of the screen. These can cause image burn in if you have ones that are not transparent. I need to change the screen to full size to bury the identifiers some times and as a result the screen looks really big.3) The screen is like a black Mirror. It totally reflects ALL lights and in the Day its very hard to watch TV if you have a large picture window in your living room where the TV is located. Night viewing is spectacular though and i feel like i am at the movies.Overall a great TV and a bit of a hassle though if you have kids who want to play games on the TV and watch cartoons. You just need to be aware of the types of settings that you will need to swtich to in these conditions.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture, dead pixel, free & prompt upgrade as replacement", "Author": "J.

The picture quality is great and the TV itself is nice looking. I would give it 5 stars except for the following:1. Buzzing sound. My TV is one that buzzes. This honestly doesn't bother me that much and I usually can't hear it during normal viewing. I have noticed that the buzzing gets louder and softer depending on how much white is on the screen. So I notice the buzzing most during commercials where they show text over a stark white background. Usually when I watch movies or shows I don't notice the buzz at all. So this could be an issue for you, depending on how picky you are. I'm really not sure why the buzzing occurs (especially depending on the colors on screen).2. Image Retention. I've had the TV for about 4 months and I don't have any burn-in. However, this TV seems to retain images very easily. When I watch a football game on ESPN or CBS, the ghosting of the channel logo, score, teams, etc will be left on the TV screen for a while afterward. This can be a minor nuisance and also makes me think that the TV will be more susceptible to burn in down the road.Here are the settings I use for this TV and I've been very happy with them.

You will not find a bigger bang for your buck.  This is my second 50\" Samsung plasma and both are sweet!!.  Last year I bought the PN50B430, I got it on Black Friday @ Best Buy for $699.00. Under the $999.00 price range you can't beat a Samsung Plasma.I used to be pro LED / LCD until right before I bought my first plasma. What sold me was when I actually went to BB and watched LCD and Plasma, there was no competition for me. I am very picky, and even with the 240HZ I saw some artifacting when watching sports....granted I knew what to watch for.  Plus the LCD was 3 times as much money.Here is some info I have learned while doing my research.  Plasma has better contrast ratios, another words, the blacks are blacker and the whites are whiter, but on a LCD the colors are brighter. Plasma has a quicker response time, and also has 600 HZ screen refresh rate, LCD has 240HZ max.  The plasma has a glass screen, this can cause reflections, and the LCD has a matte screen which is less reflective.  The gap in power consumption is closing very fast, in some cases the same when you compare the top of the line plasma with a top LCD (Just Google it).For me price was a big consideration.  Don't forget about the rest of the money you will need to spend once you buy a flat panel.  The protection plan, wall mount, cables, sound bar, blu-ray player, upgrade to HD, etc.  For me, plasma was a better fit, for others it will be LCD, just make sure you go see for yourself which one is better for you.Now this 2010 model is better than my 2009 in that I have more control over picture settings. The color and sharpness you get is awesome, even once you tweak the sound it's not bad.....better than my 09', although I recommend the Sony soundbar HTCT100 for $199 on Amazon.I will say this about both of my Samsungs.....they both emit a slight buzz, my 2010 more so than my 2009.

On the second service call they replaced the screen, that made things even worse.  Finally, tech support got the engineers to write a firmware for my set only and they mailed me a thumb drive.

I also read up on the whole 720p and 1080p thing.  While 1080p is best, virtually no TV networks broadcast in 1080p. The main reason is most companies invested in 720 equipment to update to HD and have no plans to buy new equipment again to now update to 1080p. Therefore even if you have a 1080p TV you're watching it at 720p quality. One of the few things you can watch in 1080 is Bluerays... So you have to ask yorself if it's worth more money just for that.  In my opinion the difference is minimal and the answer would be no.  Now on to the LCD, LED, Plasma debate.  I have done a lot of reading on this and it turns out Plasma is the best.  All the burn in issues have been resolved over the last few years.  The reason why the price of Plasmas has gone down is because nobody wants them. Simple supply and demand. Supply goes up...price goes down.  The other reason why the price has gone down is because TV makers try to fool consumers with slightly thinner TV screens and 3D. Useless I say!  How much thinner do I need my TV screen? And why do I want to have to put on ridiculous glasses while I watch TV? Some people might like those features... Not me... And Internet capabilities?

I have HD service via HD DVR on cable, and I've never been disappointed with the picture quality of any HD content I've watched.Even watching blu-ray disks, which is currently more or less the primary source for true 1080p content and which should really show off the superiority of 1080p just looks absolutely great on the PN50C450. I just don't feel like I'm sacrificing much at all because this is a 720p set. I've been impressed with the picture quality especially considering that is has only roughly half the physical pixels that 1080p sets can display. I paid $719 and I'm pretty sure shipping was free, so the price was hard to beat. BB was actually matching the price I got through Amazon, but with free shipping via Amazon I saved the tax I would have paid locally and more importantly to me at the time, BB told me it could be something like 6 to 8 weeks before they could get it to the store and even that time frame they couldn't guarantee. Amazon had a relatively short period where they couldn't tell you when you might be able to get one but it got resolved that evening and I was able to order. I don't know if there really was a short lived temporary shortage on these sets caused by a lot of people snapping them up or if there was some supply chain logistics issue that caused available stores of them to temporarily drop off the radar.In any case, I wholeheartedly and unreservedly recommend the PN50C450. I can't imagine anyone finding serious fault with the picture and unless you've got money to burn I say why not pay 1/2 the price that you'd end up having to pay for a 1080p LCD when there's no glaringly obvious picture quality shortcomings that would incline me to say that nothing but 1080p will do.Comparing the PN50C450 to some other sets with similar features and even to some models in significantly more upscale price ranges at a local store display again never caused me to be anything other than favorably impressed. I was considering a Panasonic that was selling in the same price range or perhaps even marginally less expensive than the PN50C450, but the Panasonic's picture was quite obviously horrible compared to the Samsung's when viewed side by side. The Panasonic looked grainy/pixelated to me, making it stand out as PRETTY OBVIOUSLY 720p.If value for the money is at all a factor in your buying decision then I believe it would be hard to go wrong with the PN50C450. Go see if you can look at one at a local store display and just take a look around to compare it to similarly priced plasmas from other manufacturers and some LCDs which at the same size would be a bit more expensive and I virtually guarantee that you'll find the PN50C450 to be an incredible value.No I receive no compensation for singing this sets praises, I'm just as happy as could be with my purchase and and I thought it was only fair for me to share how outstanding a value I perceive the PN50C450 to be. I simply can't imagine anyone not seeing it as an incredible bang for the buck.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great 50\" HDTV for a SUPER Price", "Author": "T. Swanson", "ReviewID": "RULVLOKSZUP4W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked at this set together with a 1080p Samsung and a 1080p Panasonic set side by side at BEST BUY. From about 3-4 feet away there is not a significant difference in the picture quality. I personally liked the picture quality of the Samsung the best. For the extra money, in my opinion, it is just not worth the extra dollars to buy the 1080P set unless your playing games at a distance of 2-3 feet from the set. This TV has an outstanding picture with just 720p and it isonly $180 more than the 42\" model--a great deal!. After reading all of the reviews I was cautious about buying this set because of the issues of glare, buzzing, screw problems, etc.I do not notice any buzzing sound. With respect to all the glare people complain about, I have this set beside a South facing window with Plantation shutters open allowing light in the room, in Phoenix, AZ and the glare is about the same as on any other TV set I have owned. From straight on I do not even notice any glare. As for the screw issue, the screws supplied are self threading screws and these always require more force to insert, and this is done for a reason, to make sure that the TV display is stable/secure and minimize the potential of damage. You need to make sure that you install the display as the instructions specify, and I was able to put the display into the stand all by myself--but I too recommend two people working together to lower the display onto the stand. With a plasma it is important to keep the display vertical. I wonder if some people having difficulty putting the set on the stand are trying to do this with the display in a position other than vertical?  When I put the display in the stand from the vertical position, the screw holes were perfectly aligned/  The screws are at first hard to screw in and then as the hole is tapped to the threading of the screw, it becomes easier--this is normal. The keys on the remote actually seem bigger than some of my other remotes and makes me wonder why people have complained about it--maybe it is time to get reading glasses? The only negative issue I have with my set is that the remote sensor does not work well when the remote is pointed directly (level) from straight ahead at the TV set and seems to work best when it is pointed about 20-30 degrees above or below horizontal or from the sides--STRANGE? I think I have addressed the majority of complaints and fully recommend this TV set. I bought mine from Paul's stores got a shipping notice a few hours after I placed the order, the next day I got a telephone call from AIT, the shipper who specializes in TV delivery, that the TV set was in Phoenix and they set up an appointment to deliver it the following day (about 62 hours after I ordered the set and this was using the free shipping option).

I could accept 4 or 5 years, but not 2 1/2 years. It developed a permanent 1 pixel red line running vertically on the screen. From my research this is a failure of the plasma display panel which is unrepairable. It is out-of-warrenty so bye-bye beautiful picture. Since I loved this TV it was babied from day one. Too bad..the gentle care didn't save it.  Prior to failure it was a great TV with a rich, beautiful screen. My only complaint is it generated an enormous amount of heat (enough to over-heat our dedicated home theatre room in the summer, and heat it comfortably in the winter.)  As a result of this failure, I will not buy another plasma TV or Samsung TV. Per my research, plasma TVs WORK REALLY REALLY HARD AND GENERATE LOTS & LOTS OF HEAT. This extra heat if not removed with internal fans will eventually kill your TV. This Samsung has no fans for internal cooling, it likely cooked itself to death.  The glowing reports of this TV are merited if your particular Samsung plasma TV has lived at least 4 years. Mine didn't.Addendum: 3/13/13Contacted Samsung support via online chat.

They required me to have a Samsung service center evaluate the TV and, after an $87 service call, the panel is bad on the TV.  Here's the best part.  Samsung offered me $300 towards a new panel and the panel is $500 plus $200 in labor.  So I pay $700, get $300 from Samsung, and end up paying $400 for a TV that is now $500 brand new.  I explained the ridiculousness of this offer and they wouldn't bend one bit.  I made repeated calls, spoke to multiple people, and no one would offer anything worthwhile to compensate me for this TV.

I then asked if Samsung was doing anything about this very common quality issue, (which is evident if you just Google Samsung plasma and black lines, and I was advised by a local repair shop to contact Samsung as the problem seems to be widespread and the cost of repair would exceed the cost of a new TV), I was told that this was purely a user's perspective that it's a quality issue...I then asked if I could speak to her supervisor, to which I was told after 5 more min of holding, that no supervisor is available to talk about this issue.. and that this is not a quality issue in her view... what a helpful executive customer support line..I guess Samsung must view multiple black lines as a normal feature in their TVs.The net of this is that Samsung does not care about their customers, does not feel quality and reliability is important at all, and does not seem to care if their customers never buy another Samsung.So everyone reading this.. spread the word.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "found it in a dumpster no power...", "Author": "Jesse J.

Somehow I was denied financing through Best Buy, even though I had amazing credit (my banks exact words), so I went to ABC and was approved.  When I was purchasing the tv, I told the sales associate that I really wanted a Panasonic but I didn't like how the plastic surround bubbled out at the bottom.  I came to find out that for that model year, Samsung was rated higher in regards to picture quality over Panasonic for the first time.  Panasonic pioneered plasma televisions so naturally for years they were the best. My brother had bought the same model as this (the prior year version), and I was stunned at how good the display was, especially for how affordable it was.  My brothers had developed 3 \"stuck\" pixels but other than that it was perfect.  Wanting my tv to last as long as possible, I broke mine in for over 150 hours at less than 50% contrast, while Samsung recommends 100 hours at 50%.  I also turned my brightness and cell light down to 30-40%.  For nearly 1 year my tv was perfect.  I did develop 1 stuck pixel, and though it drove me insane at the time, no one else could see it.  Right before my warranty expired, I noticed that when the screen would go black, there would be a red/black blob across nearly the entire screen but after a week or so it had disappeared, so I didn't contact Samsung.  I didn't want refurbished parts put in my tv, which could be from a tv that had no break in period.  They do that.  Up until 3 days ago, I had given so much praise towards Samsung and the picture quality of this tv in particular.  However, while watching tv I began texting a friend and when I looked up, six inches from the right side of the screen, a red line had appeared.  Thinking it was the station I changed the channel but it was still there.  The line spans the entire vertical length (height) of the display, with a flickering pixel at the top.  Turns out to be a failing pdp board which controls the vertical plasma display.  Supposedly, but I'm not 100% sure, the boards in this set are bonded to the actual panel, which means a new panel is required.  I purchased the tv for $650 new, a new panel costs $800+ to replace.  Not really worth it.  I may still contact Samsung though my warranty has elapsed, hoping to get some help in this matter, but I have read countless horror stories about people still under warranty being screwed by Samsung.  With Samsung making the move to OLED tv's and discontinuing their LCD tv's, I was planning on purchasing an OLED display in a few years once they are under $10,000, or even $2,000 for that matter. However, if plasmas have been out longer than LCD's, and are rated to have a 27 year lifespan but mine fails at just over a year, what would make me want to jump into new technology or into buying another set from Samsung.  Luckily my tv still works and the line is only 1 pixel wide. It could be worse, but my brothers still looks the same as it did when I bought mine.  Who knows, I may be able to get the voltage adjusted on that board.  On white displays you can't see it.  When you get close enough to see the red, blue, and green pixels that make up the display, you see that the red line never dims and is consistently at full brightness.  White display = all pixels at full brightness = no irritating red line.  This line is the only reason I did not give this tv a 5* rating.  ***  Now 6 months after I wrote this review I came home to find a blue line on the left side of the screen....

We have played with all the funtions and even have it hooked up to our logitech remote. The Wii shows well and we noticed the screen changes must faster than our LCD that we have now moved to the bedroom. The only problem is that Netflix shows a little pixely but i think that is because it is streaming through the Wii and not a issue from the TV. But all in all best buy I have made 2011 so far.

So this was a change in direction...The set is amazing, the picture is phoenomenal, the set up and user guide is simple and easy to follow, you will not be disappointed! Running an HD cable box to it plus Apple Tv 2 with sound output to a Denon AVR receiver. Although teh sound from the TV is so good we haven't used the amp at all except for music through Apple TV. I don't know where all the bad sound reviews come from?? We use this set in our large living room with a lot of glass for sunlight and have experienced little reflection from the screen....although it is apparent, it hasn't deterred the viewing. We also have a dedicated theater room with a 10' wide screen and HD projector and now we find ourselves in front of this new Plasma set daily. The picture is awesome!!!One sidenote...the stand is nice but it does not swivel!!! We were trying to swivel it and it wouldn't budge. Went online with Samsung support and they were adamant that it would swivel and we wouldn't break anything but it wouldn't friggin budge! Took it apart today and there is NO WAY this will swivel so be prepared just in case.Great set, great purchase....now....just received today another Samsung 50\" Plasma 3d set, PN50c650...I hope it is as good as the last 2.

I have had no problems with it.The picture is excellent, and with broadcast TV 720p is the best resolution available anyway. Comparing this TV side by side with 1080p TVs, I did not see a difference. Comparing it side by side with LCD TVs, I saw a very noticable difference. Plasma has a better overall picture with deeper blacks and better color fidelity. LCD makes a good initial impression because of superior brightness, but that is much more useful in Wal-Mart than it is in your living room.Blue-Ray is different. The 1080p sets shine with Blue-Ray. I have an inexpensive upscaling DVD player which produces wonderful results with the Samsung, and for the time being, I am forgoing Blue-Ray.A couple tips: The TV leaves little room on back for cables when wall mounting. I chose a very flat mounting bracket, and I could not plug in component cables for my Wii. I was barely able to plug in HDMI cables, but they were pressed hard against the wall. I finally replaced the mounting bracket with a tilting model that opened up several inches behind the TV. Now everything is plugged in with room to spare.Yes, reflections can be a problem with a plasma TV. But even with a window directly behind the TV, all is fine as long as the blinds are closed.I am using Netflix on the Wii, and as long as you connect the Wii with component cables, the picture is excellent.Overall, I could not be happier.

I must report that my Samsung is very, very quite when on, in fact, you won't even know it is on unless, you are facing the screen.  The picture is very clear and crisp on most HD programming. I say that because not all TV Stations broadcast the same HD quality, some are much better than others.  Regular digital channels come in quite clear and smooth as well.

Dean \"milyrake\"", "ReviewID": "R3DKW8QGGBRVCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I too am writing this review more based on my experience than on the TV itself.  I initially ordered the Samsung B550 from [...] and after a week received that TV.  Upon arrival I learned that there was a huge hole in the back side of the box.  I opened the box and inspected the front of the TV, which looked fine so I signed for the package and off went delivery boy.  Well, once I completely removed the TV from the box I realized I should have check the back (my bad) as there was a dent in it!  It looked as though something sharp went through the box (forklift) and into the television.  Although the TV seemed to work fine I'm one that would not be satisfied keeping a newly purchased flat screen with a dent in the back.  (you know who you are)  I immediately called newegg and got the ball rolling on a refund.In the mean time I noticed the C versions were now available on Amazon, which they were not before.  The C450 was priced at $695 for a few days so I snagged that up quick.  Wait another week and I finally receive that TV from Amazon.  Package is spotless, looks like it just came out of the box making factory.  The delivery boy was heading out the door when I stopped him and told him I better open it up and make sure there's no dents in it.  haha  (thinking it's going to be perfect)  So we lift the box off and peel back that cool white foamy stuff and oh my goodness, it looked as though Roger Clemens had thrown a fast ball at the upper left corner!  Ok, now I'm starting to get a little miffed....  Two week, two Tv's, two online retailers, two big problems!So I refuse delivery on this one, obviously, and call Amazon.  Go through the transfers and finally get someone on the line who says they can either refund the money, when they get the Tv back, or send me out a new one.....oh wait, I'm sorry sir this TV is now sold out and we don't know when it will be back in stock, so you'll have to wait til they are in stock again, unless you want a refund.  I say, can you send me out a different model at the same price, and he say's the only thing they can do is take 10% off of what I paid, $695, and apply that to a different purchase.  Well, I need a Samsung to work with my equipment and really this is the one I want, that's why I ordered it in the first place!  So I guess I'll wait.  GEEZ!So I wait a few days, and a few days more and it's still not in stock and then I notice Best Buy is selling it at $719.  A little more than I paid plus I'll have to pay tax, which I hate doing, but for a few more bucks I could have an actual working TV, on my wall, projecting cool HD images and I could get it right NOW!  So that's what I did.  And guess what, it wasn't damaged and it works and it looks good and I have it and best of all I don't have to deal with anymore online retailers!TV itself looks awesome!  Can not tell a difference between the B550 1080p and the C450 720p.  My pocket book, however, can definitely tell a difference of about $300.Morale of the story is, unbox your TV and look at it before the delivery man leaves.  And maybe another morale of the story is, don't buy a Plasma Flat Screen from an online retailer....You may be waiting longer than you expected for that nice Tv and you don't know what it's been through on the way to your house.Thanks for reading and I hope it helps.(updating my rating per user backlash - 1 or 2 stars for service - 5 stars for TV itself)", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung is irresponsible", "Author": "jq279", "ReviewID": "R2HQQS9G88UXJO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The TV came with wrong screws.

Nice sleek design. Read alot of reviews about the buzz problem.. Well mine does have a slight buzz, but its only noticeable when one is 1-2 ft from the TV. I don't notice the buzz at all, when watching from the sofa. There is no buzz when the TV is off, so i'm happy. To put it in perspective, my PS3 is noticeably louder than the TV's buzz. Great size and picture quality for around $720. I think its a great deal.The above was all correct up untill the tv died on me in about 2 months of light use. The tv turns on and off at random times at about 30 secs apart repeatedly. Right now the tv is unplugged and am waiting for Samsung to repair it.

To my horror , I see a 'used and scratched' plasma stand in my box. And worse , it wasn't even the stand for this TV. It was for a 42 inch plasma wrongly put in this box.Now, I wonder if there is any quality check done on these products at all. Not sure if Samsung or Amazon is to be blamed here.I called Amazon service who transferred me to some hotline. The rep at the hotline asked me to contact Samsung and said that they could do nothing about this. Now , why would I have to go through troubles of dealing with Samsung customer service on the 1st day of my brand new tv. After arguing with them for a while ,they agreed to replace this television set. (This was on 8th March)The new one has been shipped out since 9th March and I have yet not received it. I contacted amazon again and after transferring me from one department to another, they transferred me to Pilot shipping company. They said they could not deliver it to me because they did not have my phone no. (well, that's funny because they just delivered the same tv from same company via Amazon last week.So I get transferred internally via their department and then call hangs up abruptly. I lost all my patience and decided to write this review here. The price on this TV has gone down by xxx $ at a local store to what it was when I placed the order.UPDATE March 24:- I received my TV. This mistake was by Pilot shipment because they lost my phone no. Also Samsung confirmed that they ship out exactly same stand for 42 and 5 inch plasmas. So Amazon was not at fault. To all fellow reviewers , I think Amazon is still good because they exchanged my TV, did not charge me for any return shipping. Not sure if any other retailer would have done the same considering how expensive it is to ship these heavy TVs. I am satisfied and would shop Amazon again in future.
