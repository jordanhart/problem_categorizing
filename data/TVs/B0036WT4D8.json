You do your research the best you can and hope that your purchase will be everything you hoped it would be.  Occasionally, you are thrown for a loop and presented with some challenges that you didn't anticipate.  That's what happened to me when I picked up this excellent TV.  My old Sony LCD did not have HDMI ports, so I was relegated to the spaghetti bowl of component hookups to achieve high definition.  I just had to have a TV with HDMI, so when I was finally in the market I knew it would have to be at least 46\", LCD or something comparable, full 1080p, and have plenty of HDMI ports on it.  With the exception of one small issue, this TV is everything I wanted.I must say that the Samsung UN46C6500 LED TV is astonishing to look at.  The colors are rich and saturated, black levels are the blackest I've ever seen, and the images are crisp and clear.  The screen is a glossy finish, so it does reflect any light you might have in the room, but it's not overly distracting.  The panel itself is super thin, only about one inch thick.  The stand is very sturdy.  Touch sensitive buttons line the lower right hand corner of the panel (kind of hard to see, but they're responsive).  The bezel has a brushed matte charcoal grey strip covering a transparent acrylic (very elegant).The one problem I have with this TV is not listed anywhere except inside the manual.  I didn't see any other documentation or warnings about this, so I was a little disappointed when I encountered it.  This TV is not compatible with HDMI versions older than 1.3.  My old Onkyo receiver (TX-SR604) came with HDMI 1.1, so the TV would not display images through it.  I had always thought that HDMI was backwards compatible.  It's not on this TV, and the manual clearly says that if you have any components with HDMI versions older than 1.3 you may have issues with sound and video.  Beware.Because I was so disappointed that I would not be able to use HDMI through my receiver, I decided to upgrade to the Denon AVR-791 (which supports HDMI 1.4 and is 3D ready).  Even though I'm another $500 poorer, I'm an extremely happy camper.  Watching Avatar on blu-ray with this setup is truly amazing.  The TV performs wonderfully and is otherwise exactly what I was wanting.  I have not ventured into the internet TV features, but that's on the horizon.  Unfortunately, the TV is not wifi compatible (unless you buy a USB adapter), so you'll need to use an ethernet cable (I actually knew this before buying).Samsung makes incredible LCD and LED TV's.  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high definition viewing experience.  Hopefully, my review will educate and warn those with older components.  HDMI is the way to go, but you can always fall back on component cables if you have to.  That just wasn't an option for me.  When all is said and done, I don't regret my purchase at all.  The end result was well worth the journey.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good picture, very bad sound and other deficiencies", "Author": "rocketscientist", "ReviewID": "R15O08JNXDSABH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "What's good: an excellent picture (good blacks, vivid though slightly unnatural colors), classy looking thin panelWhat's bad: very poor sound (single back-firing speaker, not even stereo sound),highly reflective screen (glare problem), ugly and obstructive 4-footed stand, poorly designed remote control, WiFi setup buggy.Had this TV for about a month, have not yet calibrated it with a HDTV calibration DVD but was able to eyeball adjust the brightness, contrast, and color settings to get a very pleasing  picture.  But no amount of playing with the audio settings could I get a decent sound.  Dialogs all sound tinny, the best I could do was to cut the \"10K\" equalization setting down to minimum to reduce the \"tinny-ness\" of spoken words at the expense of getting much high frequency with music.  Neither could I get any stereo effect out of the TV and playing with the \"balance\" audio setting made no difference in the sound.  The reason became clear when I opened the back plate of the TV.  The sound comes from a single 3\" back-firing speaker, driven by a single pair of wires from the audio board.  The 3\" speaker is pancake flat, giving the cone little extension for producing the lower frequency sounds.  A single pair of wires can produce only one channel of sound and my guess it's a mono channel.  I cannot understand why the specification claims \"10 Watts x 2 audio power stereo broadcast reception\" when there is only one speaker.The obvious solution is to get a sound bar or a home theater audio system to handle the audio.  The Samsung sound bar sounds like a good bet, but here's where Samsung fails to provide an aesthetically pleasing solution.  If the TV is not wall-mounted, the 4-footed stand prevents the sound bar from sitting right below the TV bezel.  As much as the ToC decor is meant to help with the spouse factor, the sound bar addition will send one once again to the dog house.  Samsung, Wake Up!!!  If you can't make the sound bar look good with the TV, then you can at least try to provide decent stereo sound.A few other issues with this TV and probably all Samsung LCD TV's.  The highly reflective display surface creates a very distracting reflection if there is a light source directly opposite the screen; this is especially a problem when the scene has low light intensity.  This TV is in our bedroom and the nightstand lights have to be turned off in order to watch a movie at night.The remote control leaves a lot to be desired.  Not only can it not control a Samsung DVD player, the ergonomics is far shy of other brands.  Just try using the navigational and enter keys by feel without looking and you will get an exercise in frustration.  Those keys are not sculpted to gives you any feel for which key you are pushing, and unlike other keys, they are not backlit, so when you are navigating the Samsung apps at night, you may have to turn on a light that you just turned off to avoid the screen glare problem.  Samsung could learn a great deal by studying a Toshiba TV remote.One other problem I encountered was in setting up the WiFi connection.  The same Samsung WiFi USB adapter on the Samsung Blu-ray DVD player connected to my wireless router without any problem.  Yet the same adapter failed to connect to the router when it's moved over to the TV.  This is all done with the Samsung WiFi adapter on a USB extension cable that allows the adapter to be placed in exactly the same spot regardless of which device it was wired to.  It took some playing around, but it finally got down to the fact that my router has SSID broadcast disabled.  The DVD player software has no trouble with not seeing a broadcasted SSID whereas the TV's software wouldn't initialize to it even when all the proper information was entered in the setup procedure.  When I turned on SSID broadcast, the TV connected to the router right away and the signal strength was excellent.  Once I had the TV connected to the router, I was able to disable SSID broadcast and the TV now connects to the router without a problem; so the bug seems to be only in the software for initial connection.Given all the deficiencies with this TV, as much as I liked the picture quality, I would not recommend this TV, especially at the price that has to be paid.  There are TV's with equally good picture quality, much better sound, less glare and better remote control ergonomics.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Image Quality!", "Author": "Laercio Silva Jr.", "ReviewID": "R10FTJNYPT9MQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't speak english enough for a review, so I'll resume my experience with this amazing tv.Pros:- The first good impression I had, was the very good built quality and the soft weight.- The Design is very nice, the TV side is really slim and the color is a kind of black mate, beautiful.- The image quality is really impressing.- The stand is the best designed I have seen.- Is so far better than my 1 year old Samsung LCD Series 7- If you have a Xbox 360 you will see totally different the way to play games- The allshare is one of the best functions on that tv, pictures, videos, music and everything you have on your computer you can see on TV.Cons:- No 3D (I know is not included on this model)- No built in wi-fi, only wired internet (You have to buy the wi-fi adapter separately.)- The internet apps is starting so no expect the apps you see on amazon page- The allshare doesn't work with MacIn resume i love it, I don't know if is because is my first LED tv, but it is everything I was expected from Samsung and is better so far, I'm using 2 weeks now, and I can't see movies o games again on my old TV.::::UPDATE:: 04/19/2010I'm updating that review to share how I have improved my experience with that TV!CALIBRATION FOR XBOX 360With game mode turned on, you won't get the best from this TV.This adjust is so far better than using \"Game Mode\", you will get the best image on Xbox 360 after the TV is turned on for 20 minutes.# Picture Modes  * Picture Mode : Standard  * Color Temperature : Warm 1 or Normal  * Aspect Ratio : 16:9# Picture Settings  * Backlight : 9  * Contrast : 90  * Brightness : 46  * Sharpness : 10  * Color : 49  * Tint : G50/R50# Advanced Settings  * Black Tone : Off  * Dynamic Contrast : Low  * Shadow Detail : -2  * Gamma : 0  * RGB Only Mode : Off  * Color Space : Auto  * White Balance : Factory Default  * 10p White Balance : Off  * Fleshtone : 0  * Edge Enhancement : Off  * xvYCC : Off  * LED Motion Plus : OFF# Picture Options  * Color Tone : Warm 1 or Normal  * Size : 16:9  * Digital Noise Filter : On  * MPEG Noise Filter : Off  * HDMI Black Level : Normal  * Auto Motion Plus 120Hz : StandardCALIBRATION FOR BLU-RAYIf you have too many lights on your the TV room, you need change only the Backlight setting.# Picture Modes  * Picture Mode : Movie  * Color Temperature : Warm 1 or Warm 2  * Aspect Ratio : 16:9# Picture Settings  * Backlight : 8  * Contrast : 90  * Brightness : 45  * Sharpness : 10  * Color : 45  * Tint : G50/R50# Advanced Settings  * Black Tone : Off  * Dynamic Contrast : Low  * Shadow Detail : -2  * Gamma : 0  * RGB Only Mode : Off  * Color Space : Auto  * White Balance : Factory Default  * 10p White Balance : Off  * Fleshtone : 0  * Edge Enhancement : Off  * xvYCC : Off  * LED Motion Plus : off# Picture Options  * Color Tone : Warm 1 or Warm 2  * Size : 16:9  * Digital Noise Filter : On  * MPEG Noise Filter : Off  * HDMI Black Level : Normal  * Auto Motion Plus 120Hz : Standard: (I like to use STANDARD because I like the natural movement of the picture, but if you like closer to Theater quality, you can use the adjustment CLEAR or SMOOTH)", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice TV...with a few subtle issues", "Author": "James \"Jim\"", "ReviewID": "R28E8MMBUGVULB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first impression of this set is that it has good picture quality but rather poor sound.  I did not expect much from the set in terms of sound due to its thin design.  It should be noted that the 6400 is the same TV but without the Samsung Apps/Internet@TV feature and a different stand.  I will say that I could certainly live without the Apps feature but it is nice to be able to stream my photos from Flickr without having to hook up my laptop or other computer.  Weather is nice too.  I also am not real excited about the stand.  The 6400 has a square flat stand that you could place on top of a set top box or a small stand.  The 6500 has a 4 footed prong type stand.As far as TV performance, I will say that it is quite good.  Colors aren't over saturated so as to look artificial.  You may find that the box stores crank the brightness up in the store so the TV looks more appealing to shoppers.  I found that many sets don't look nearly as good as they did on the ultra bright mode.  This set however performs just as well in my preferred dimmer setting as it does bright.  There are some annoyances such as pixelization and blotches in the dark scenes where there is motion.  However, its hard to tell whether this is a by-product of broadcast companies, cable companies, and satellite companies compressing the heck out of HD signals or the TV itself.  The TV performs admirably as well in standard definition broadcasts.  LED vs LCD: well, if we are comparing apples to apples (using the same class of TV and same broadcast) I can't really tell that big of a difference. Longevity of the LED lighting technology is yet to be determined.  I have no interest in a 3D set so I cannot compare this set to those as I never given them much more than a glance at the store.  I will warn you, Samsung does have its customer service annoyances but hopefully you will never need them.  I chose the 6500 with the Samsung Apps feature because I figured one day as more companies come on board with their apps there may be something useful.  All in all it's no Pioneer Elite Kuro but its a good set for the price.", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Review of online services", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R30SO5TVKS1A4N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are tons of reviews on the picture quality of this TV (Which is pretty good) so I wanted to focus on the Samsung Apps and internet@Tv which is the main reason I bought this TV.  I don't watch much TV so I do not have cable or DirectTV but I do get about 14 channels over the air which is fine for me.  I spend a fair amount of time online though so when I got everything hooked up the first thing I did was start messing with the Samsung apps. I used a wired connection and I had no problems getting online.  When you first connect it downloads all the Samsung apps and updates the TV. After that you have to create an account at [...] and sign in on your TV.  It's extremely clunky having to type in your username and password and I spent about an hour trying to get it connected. Every time I entered my username and password on the TV it would say it was invalid.  Once I realized I had to register the physical TV with Samsung (Write down your serial number before you put it on the wall) it connected no problem.  It doesn't say that anywhere on the Samsung site which was kind of frustrating. After you get the TV registered you can use the Samsung apps.  The most of the apps themselves are very disappointing.  The AP News ticker is a cool idea and it works but it's kind of pointless. Google maps is kind of clunky to use and you can't search on it. The weather is pointless for me since you have to select from a list of cities and mine wasn't on there. Then there's Pandora and Netflix.  These apps were the reason I bought the TV and they don't disappoint.  With netflix the quality is awesome and the controls are intuitive. You add your movie into the instant queue from a computer (No browsing netflix from your TV which is kind of nice because typing would is frustrating on a remote) and when you get to your TV you just press play.  I watched a couple streaming \"HD\" movies (streaming movies aren't close to bit rates of normal HD DVDs) and it looked extremely good.  Pandora is awesome as well.  It ties into your pandora account and you just fire up the app and hit play.  As other reviews state the sound quality of this TV isn't the best but it's not terrible.  It feels like Samsung is trying to create a iPhone or Android type market place but they have a LONG ways to go.  As it stands right now there are maybe 30 apps and most of them are pretty pointless. Hopefully they can develop this technology even more.  A browser on the TV would be the ultimate. So in closing if you're looking for a thin LED TV with a good picture and want to stream netflix and pandora at a reasonable price this TV is yours.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Failed within 3months", "Author": "Phaduman \"Phal\"", "ReviewID": "R1P4W25TY54Z03", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this item from another store. I was excited in this latest generation LED-edgelit TVs, so thin, and such good clarity. Within 2 months of ownership, with average of 30mins of viewing per day (some days longer, some days of no watching), the TV would occasionally turn off and within seconds, turn back on. My son, who would be watching e.g. alone would call out saying TV turned off, and then reassure it is back on.About a few days ago, the TV started powering on/off every few minutes and would never stop doing that. I had the Ethernet cable connected, so I got the firmware upgrade done - thankfully the system upgraded the firmware and didn't go through power-cycle during that time. The firmware kept it stable for say half a day, then the power-cycles came back again. I checked the power outlets, cable connections etc. All other electrical systems (like receiver, HT computer all were stable).I google searched for this problem, and the issues have been all over the place. It was shocking. Customers state Samsung would replace the main motherboard and after after a few months, the same problems would re-appear. Some stated it was some cheap capacitors used on the boards that caused the issues. Problem was not limited to 46-inch display.I was within 90-day window and returned it to the store and bought the Sony edge-LED EX700 series 52-inch. The viewing quality is just as good, in fact, it didn't look as artificial as Samsung colors came out, it is more natural. I think Samsung is cutting corners on quality. I hope Sony stays true to its legendary quality. Only time will tell. Good luck!

The picture quality is outstanding.  We are very happy with the LED edge lighting.  It has a sensor to determine ambient light and adjusts the strength of the backlight accordingly, which should save a lot of electricity over the lifespan of the tv.  The sound quality is decent, though I expect we'll be investing in a Surround Sound home theater system in the near future.  Setup was very easy.  All user interfaces are very intuitive.  The user is able to make many, many adjustments to the picture, though to be honest we were anxious about messing things up so we left everything on the \"Home\" default setting.  This tv integrated flawlessly with our Samsung Blu-Ray player allowing everything to be controlled with the tv remote.  We also love that this tv is networked-- we use the Netflix and Pandora apps on a daily basis.A major selling point of this tv for us was the aesthetics of the very slim design, and we were not disappointed.  This unit is THIN!  The graphite-colored frame around the LCD screen is also quite narrow, and a thin, clear acrylic band runs around the entire frame-- a classy touch that does not show up well in photos of the unit.  We also are very happy with the stand.  Its chromed X shape is different than most stands which are a flat black plastic pedestal, and we are very pleased with the way it looks.Overall, an excellent tv, and we highly recommend it.A note on the service from Amazon.com:  We were initially a little reluctant to make such a large purchase from an online retailer.  And our fears almost came true... the first unit shipped to us had a factory defect (the tv would forget all settings every time we turned it off, requiring us to go through the Plug-and-Play menu and channel scan every time we turned on the set... irritating!  Samsung tech support was stumped by the problem, though they did offer to send a repairman out to take a look at it, which would be covered by the 1 year factory warranty).  We declined Samsung's offer of the repairman, and called amazon.com customer support instead.  They instantly recognized the problem, apologized for the inconvenience, and shipped a new set to us immediately.  The delivery man dropped off the replacement set and took away the defective one at the same time.

I am hanging it on the wall and it looks spectacular.  The colors are so true and the picture so crisp that people are amazed at what they see.  The 120 mHz really changes how you watch shows although I have had some negative feedback from that standpoint.  Some have said it makes all shows look like soap operas, although I think it's an improvement from the former 60 mHz tv's.One other negative, if you turn the lights down in the room the tv actually adjusts to this and darkens the tv, something that I did not like during the NBA Finals.  If you have a very dark room you might want to think about another tv, although maybe you can change the presets to offset this (I have not fiddled with these yet).All in all it's an amazing tv and one well worth the money and I would definitely tell my friends to buy the same.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "My Samsugn LED review", "Author": "ReggieRice", "ReviewID": "R213QU9GBFL39R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my TV about 3 weeks ago.

Pilot delivered the TV on time and in one piece.I am moving up from a 32 in. Samsung LCD so i was a pretty big jump in quality.  I mounted the TV with the Samsung slim mount that actually gave me the most problems.(mostly my mechanical errors though)  The TV sits as flat as possible along the wall making it look like a painting.Picture:Just amazing!!

We had HD cable installed to be certain that we were giving both TVs a fair opportunity to perform to their intended best.Drawbacks included only the glossier screen (not crystal-clear glossy, but close) than the more matt-like Sony and the inability of the Samsung to control its audio OUT volume concurrently with the TV sound.  So we have to adjust the volume on our standard stereo separately from the TV's volume.  Sony was able to provide variable audio OUT.The internet connectivity of both TVs was excellent.  It's great seeing our NetFlix streams over the net and not have to shuffle DVD discs around.  That, alone, was worth the value of the net connectivity.  The Sony was more handsome, unless you prefer the space-age appearance of the Samsung.  The speakers on the Samsung sound better than the Sony.We got ours for $1100 from HHGregg.

First of all, I love it. It's crazy thin and looks very sexy on my TV stand. However, pretty much anything would have looked better than my old 27\" box TV that I upgraded from. I was originally going to go with an LCD, but I could not pass up Amazon's amazing deal they had with this TV, and I wanted to get something I was going to be satisfied with for a long time.Here's what I like:-I thought the four-legged stand the TV comes with looked a little iffy in the pictures, but now that I have the TV, I am very satisfied with it. I don't think this TV is going to be tipping over...ever. It seems more stable than the rectangular-bottomed stand my father-in-law's LCD TV came with.-46\" is huge. There's about 8 feet or so between my couch and the TV. However, now that I'm getting used to it (remember, I upgraded from 27\"), I think this was the perfect size. I may have been left wanting more if I had gotten smaller. Any bigger and it would have been difficult to watch movies and play FPS's on my 360. My stand is 55\" long and the TV fits perfectly on it. There's just the right amount of space on each side of the TV.-The picture is BEAUTIFUL. The blacks are BLACK. If the TV goes black, I can't tell if it's on or off. I am very impressed with the picture and the amount of detail I'm getting. I have it hooked up to an OLD antenna, and it still picks up channels in HD - and they look great! However, my wife isn't loving the fact that now we can see everyone's sweaty, pimply face. It really is almost like looking through a window. The picture is VERY bright. Cartoons look very cool. The colors pop. I love it.-Xbox looks awesome. I have it hooked up with HDMI. I can finally read the writing in Mass Effect 2, hurray! No more squinting! Everything is so crisp. I don't know how I played games before on my old TV. I notice so many more details now.-Blu Ray looks spectacular also. I have watched 300 and The Hangover. Both looked very, very good. I've noticed now when I watch movies, I don't pay as much attention to the story, but rather, pay more attention to all the detail I could never see with my old TV.-Amazon free delivery was awesome. The delivery guy brought it in and did most of the work unpacking it and putting it on the stand for me. I just helped lift it up. He checked it and made sure there were no issues before he had me sign for it.And now, the other stuff about the TV:First of all, TURN OFF THE ECO SENSOR THING. When the room becomes dark it dims itself to a very dark level. It's lame. You don't want that on. I'm glad I can turn it off, so no big complaints.The screen is pretty glossy and dust likes to attach to it. I need to invest in a electrostatic duster or something. You don't want a window pointing at this in the daytime, or else you'll see some big-time glare. Luckily, I don't so I don't have any issues watching at day or night.I was unsuccessful connecting to the internet with the Samsung wireless adapter. However, I'm not a huge fan of my internet provider, so I'm not blaming it on the TV yet. I've only tried once. I was able to get the Blu Ray player connected with no issues though. The wireless adapter is kind of fat, so if you are going to mount with that sweet looking low-profile mount, it may not work so well with the adapter attached.Playing the bright Toy Story 3 game had a lot of choppiness. However, when I turned the game mode on, the choppiness went away for the most part. I did not get any choppiness with Left 4 Dead 2 with the game mode on. I haven't tried with it off yet.

MacPhail", "ReviewID": "RP0I8AICBI07W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got the 55 inch version of this. Happy so far.Here's some info that would have helped me. - - - The Remote  - - -I uploaded a pic. Sensible. Tasteful. Large, clean markings. Back-light. Odd that there's a \"Yahoo!\" button. - - - The Frame - - -Why do so many expensive TVs have a GLOSSY black frame that draws attention to warpage and molding flaws and also adds distracting reflections? Seems like they're trying real hard to make an expensive product look junky.This TV does not have that. Its brushed charcoal frame does not look horrible at all. There's also a clear plastic outer frame extending 3/8\"+ on all 4 sides. Pretty harmless. I guess they wanted to keep a toe-hold in the world of tacky bling. (See uploaded pic.)  - - - Connecting Older Devices - - -One disappointment: The stated \"1 Component Input, 1 Composite (AV) Input...\" is actually a single combined input.There are 5 RCA jacks (Audio-L, Audio-R, Pb, Pr, Y) and the \"Y\" connection also can work as a Composite (AV Low Def - Yellow plug) Video-In.  So, if you have a few older Composite (AV) devices (Wii, Series 2 TiVo, VCR...) you can add a switch-box such as Sima SVS-14 (4 Input) and funnel them all into the TV, but if you also want/need to use component connections from an older DVD player, it gets complicated. The TV seems to declare the input AV or Component based on physical presence of a plug in the Pb jack. I'm still trying to figure this out so I don't have to handle cables each time I use the DVD player. This problem is of course temporary, until some older devices retire.Also, the listed \"PC Audio Input\" and \"DVI Audio Input\" are one and the same.  - - - Low Def Viewing - - -We're watching a lot of standard-def (TiVo Series 2) for a while. This TV displays it OK. It does not make it \"even worse than low def.\" Consumer Reports gives it \"Excellent\" for Standard def viewing. The P.SIZE button on the remote lets you easily toggle between picture fitting options (crop, stretch, black bar). I prefer black side bars, but the manual warns of uneven screen burn if you do this more than 5% of the time.  - - - In/Out Connections - - -All connections are on the LEFT side of the TV. (If looking from the back, the connections are on your RIGHT). Except the power cord connects near the middle.Nice high-contrast black/white labels are a far cry from the raised black-on-black lettering we all learned to hate over the years.Inputs & Outputs as stated on Samsung's site: -  4 HDMI Inputs (Rear) -  1 Component Input -  1 Composite (AV) Input -  1 PC Input (D-sub) -  1 PC Audio Input (Mini Jack) -  1 Ethernet Port -  2 USB 2.0 Ports -  1 Optical Digital Audio Output -  1 Audio Output (Mini Jack) -  1 DVI Audio Input (Mini Jack) -  1 RF Input - - - Glare - - -Seems like the anti-reflection design is about as good as it could be...better than I expected. Also, we get some direct sunlight in the late afternoon, which it handles surprisingly well. I'm glad I went with this glossy model vs matte. But if you have windows or bright lights in the wrong place, glare could be quite noticeable. - - - Audio Output - - -Audio output to cordless headphones works fine. I needed a $2 adapter like this: RiteAV - 3.5mm to RCA Stereo Female Cable - 6 inch.  Use \"Mute\" to kill the TV speakers, the audio-out connection still works.- - - Owner Manual - - -The 61-page English-only manual only scratches the surface. For example, how do you disable the annoying melody that plays each time you turn the TV on or off? I had to Google it. This and 200 other things are not covered. The manual is like an organized string of true-isms that is not really concerned with full explanations or full understanding.You can download the manual (available in 4 languages) from Samsung's site to answer some detailed questions before buying. - - - One-click Price Check - - -The amazon price jumps around.The excellent \"Online Price Alert\" (Google it) does not work for hidden-price items like this. But if you keep it in your cart as \"Saved Items--To Buy Later,\" price checks are easy. A yellow message box at the top of your shopping cart shows any price changes. No \"proceed to checkout\" necessary. Just bookmark your cart and you've got a one-click price check.

Arrived earlier than the appointed time, but all they did was deliver--I made them wait until I inspected the TV and was satisfied. Not going to ding the review for that, but I would ding the delivery co (Pilot) if given a chance.The TV was very easy to assemble, and very light, compared to my old Philips 37-inch LCD. In fact, the width on both are the same, but the Samsung is a bit taller. Overall, it takes up as much space as the old TV, so that was a plus.The default picture quality was way too bright and constrasty, but that goes with the territory. The adjustment menus are easy with helpful hints on the bottom. Hooked up to my cable box, it really shows how crappy SD broadcasts are; HD broadcasts are very noticeably better.The 4 HDMI inputs are more than enough for my use (Cable, Apple TV, DVD). All of the audio is output from the optical jack to my receiver.The Internet apps seem, from my initial impression, just ok. Samsung has its own app store where you can purchase and download apps like games, video channels (Netflix, Vudu) and internet applets. Some are free, some cost anywhere between 99cents to about 2 bucks. Where it could be better is the response time when navigating through the app store, as well as navigating within the Yahoo app (the remote has a dedicated button for accessing Yahoo). It's awfully slow! The TV is wired directly to the router that's connected to a 16mb connection. Videos like Netflix play just fine, it's just that it's very slow to navigate through the menus. It seems the processor that handles the apps is just barely able, or rather the apps and the TV's menu system could have been written more efficiently. Compared to my Apple TV, which navigates and plays videos with ease, Samsung's apps leaves quite a bit to be desired.Samsung also has a remote app for the iPhone/iPad (free). It's a nice touch, and since it works within your home network, there's no need to be in line of sight. It duplicates the remote buttons, changing the layout depending on what you're doing (e.g., bring up keyboard when it needs to, etc). Very handy when signing up and changing the settings on the aforementioned Yahoo app.Although I'm using my Apple TV for internet video (mostly Netflix), I feel I have to ding Samsung for the lack of quality for its own apps and menus. Moreover, they don't seem to be too keen on keeping the software updated, unlike dedicated units like Apple and others.Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the TV.

The only difference I have been able to find between the 6400 and the 6500 is the stand, and I much prefer the \"6400\" stand.  We just changed from a \"Sony Grand Vega\" 42inch Projection HDTV, and, although the \"Sony\" was a good set, the picture and sound in our new \"6400\" is far superior. Like unreal!!!We have \"DirectTV\", and the HD programs are unbelievable compared to the \"Sony\". This is a great TV, with a great look. At this point some of the non-HD programming does appear to be more blurry than on the \"Sony\", while other non-HD programming looks just fine.  I have not yet worked with any of the settings and adjustments (of which there are many). With tuning the picture clarity on those stations and programs may improve.My \"Special Person\" is very demanding when it comes to television quality, and I was quite concerned that she might be disappointed in the degree of improvement resulting from the upgrade.  However, she was \"blown away\", as was I, as we did our initial \"test spin\" through our various programs and stations.  In fact, although she had just come over from working on her computer, to see how the set-up was going, she was so impressed, that we stopped the set-up, and spent the rest of the evening watching HD programs. Very Impressive!!I have not yet set up the \"Internet@TV\" feature at this point, but I do not expect problems in that regard as I have a pretty good background with computers.

DNLA just works great!", "Author": "Dad_of_2", "ReviewID": "R2ZENMUKCPVE0T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me tell you... this is a great TV! I first wanted to get a 8000 series 3D TV but since not much content yet, I decided to go with this one.It's got nice and crisp picture quality. It's just amazing how clear the picture is.Internet feature is nice to have but not so intuitive. There aren't that many apps but I expect more apps near future. It's got a nice diagnostic feature to detemine what kind of internet speed you have and how your streaming experience would be like.I have not detected any ghosting nor pixalation... even if I can detect those I won't be surpriced since there are some technical limitations to those matters and I have seen from other reviews that it does not happen a lot.Sound is kid of on the weak side but what do you expect from an ultra-slim TV... So I connected to my Samsung Home Theatre System and that worked great.Now let me tell you how DNLA feature of this TV is. I have seen numerous reviews on how great this TV is with a lot of details but not really how to stream all kinds of video formats over the network. So I thought I'd give a litte more details on how it got it to work properly.DNLA works great...\"BUT\" that's if you have the right media sharing application on your computer.At first, I was happy that I was able to stream movie files from a home computer until I realized that Samsung PC Share was not working well. It cannot map network drives nor it can stream MKV files. The TV itself can play MKV files via USB drive but not via network.So I relalized that it must be the sharing utility that's giving me hard time not the TV itself... Some research and I tested with the follwing:1. Windows Media (From XP and Win 7): This works with AVI files but not w/ MKV and it cannot index all your library... it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't...2. PS3MediaServer: confusing interface... and somehow it kept crashing my computer...3. TwonkyMedia: This was a potential keeper since works better than above options but it does not work with MKV either. So out of my computer...4. Mezzmo: Among all the ones I tried, it's got the best interface and easy setup. It can create library from my mapped network drives and USB drives. Best of all, it can stream MKV without any problem. It's got the TV profile for different TV models including this TV... I guess it's used to detemine the file formats that the device can play so it can transcode non-supported video formats before it streams to your TV. Ability to rename the shared folder names is a huge plus for those like myself who likes to have the folders organized. I haven't really tested yet but it's got options to share your iTunes library as well. I guess this could be handy if you want to share your videos in iTunes library... So far Mezzmo worked great with my TV. Streaming has been flawless regardless the file size and format.Conclusion: TV itself is just great...I strongly recommend it... but not the Samsung PC Share if you are looking to use the DNLA feature. If you a looking into using DNLA then just install Mezzmo and you'll be ready to go.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price!", "Author": "tjk", "ReviewID": "R3HY0TGYXOD3NF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the picture quality of this TV.

problem again, had Samsung Send me out a Tech to fix it and he didn't even know what to do, he said he never seen anything like it, I think I may have found the problem out, on this model the AC power cord only has 2 prongs instead of 3 like most HDTV's do, I believe since it's not properly  grounded it keeps getting a shock, so I bought a Monster Cable power strip to help supply \"cleaner\" power, same problem, Samsung said they would replace it themselves but I won't see the TV for 2 weeks, this is a joke, what can I do? if you have this model watch a wide screen movie when the black bars show on top and bottom and watch the bottom of the screen and tell me if you get the same issue.  I mean I love the TV and everything but those green flashes bother the heck out of me when watching a movie.UPDATE!!!!!if you turn the auto motion to smooth so the picture does not look \"shakey\" when watching movies, if you turn the auto motion plus to smooth you will see the green lines but if you leave it at standard then you won't see them, this is an issue and Samsung needs to come out with an update.  try it out on your TV if you have this model.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beware of the power supply boards", "Author": "Serge Kavetsky \"Mr. Fix-it\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y6TEFBCPV1JM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Achilles heal of LCD series of this television was the power supply board.

The most bothersome thing is the lack of a unified remote control and the means to access the apps via the remote.

I had a Samsung 46\" LCD before, so I figured I'd upgrade to the LED. It was delivered via freight, so you have to take some time for that (kudos to the freight company--I called to let them know I was tight on time and they were there immediately). Overall, I am very pleased with the TV.Pros:*Bright, deep and rich color*Internet apps.  I haven't played with this a whole lot, but through one of the pre-installed was able to get a free movie rental.  1080p streaming over the internet.  Awesome.*Multitudes of configuration options.  You can get lost in all the menu options.  This is great if you're the person that likes to tinker and customize.  I haven't changed the default settings on mine a whole lot, just haven't had the time.*Ease of installation.  I was at home by myself when it was delivered.  Within half an hour I had it setup and workingCons:*Speaker quality.  Don't expect a whole lot from the stock speaker system.  It's only 1.1\" thick, so getting a speaker that will sound great in there just won't happen. Get yourself a sound bar or a surround sound system.*Some scenes can get choppy. Because of the 120 Hz or the processing going on, when someone moves their head you sometimes get a few choppy frames.  Maybe this is my TV service, but it sticks out.Other thoughts:*Out of the box settings look like every HD channel is a soap opera.  I know this can be changed through the settings, but after watching it a while, you get used to it and definitely makes for a clearer, sharper, crisper picture.*I could do without the clear bevel. Not sure what purpose it serves.*Not a huge fan of the stand.Overall, I love Samsung TVs and would purchase another one.

I was very pleased with the whole process.  When I ordered the TV I didnt realize there was a special that if ordered by March a free LAN Adapter (to connect to internet) would be provided.  Right away I contacted Amazon via chat and their customer svc rep, Makesh, told me that although the order was being processed and LAN cpuld not be added, he could promo the entire cost of LAN after I ordered it, which he did......love Amazon's customer service, it has always been very good....Now about the TV, it arrived undamaged, it was delivered by Pilot, I was concerned after reading negative reviews, but had no problem with our delivery.  Once we had it set up, the picture is absolutely FANTASTIC, we could not be more pleased, I read a review that it was so close to 3D and we do agree!

I decided this time I around that I would switch to Samsung from Sony so I deliberated between all the options and model choices available. It basically came down to 3D vs. Non-3D.

Plus, we don't like the idea of wearing those silly glasses either.With regard to this LED, it's 5-stars all-around from ease-of-use to picture quality (my mouth still hangs open) but 1 star for sound quality. I understand that the set is wafer thin and you probably couldn't jam in a big, fat woofer but still could've been better. So, we bought a Samsung HW-C450 Soundbar Speaker and it's now perfect. In addition, built-in streaming apps, like Netflix and Pandora, are just so convenient and have changed our viewing and listening behavior.One note: people have pointed out the \"flashlighting\" on the bottom corners. You can really only see if it watch in a completely dark room or the screen is completely black. Even then, you really don't even notice unless you look for it. The people who have sent this TV back over this one issue are nuts (IMHO).Oh, and being an iPhone user, there's an app to control the TV available for free to control the unit.

The set is packaged well by Samsung and arrived with no issues. Set up was fast and hook up is a breeze. The Samsung Apps are good. The wireless works well, but I have to re-enter my router passkey to get it up and running. I have watched a few movies from Netflix and that process is painless and the movie ran perfectly.  At times the pictures dims during Internet use. I assuming it's due to bandwith, etc. Delivery from Pilot was OK. The delivery guy was great, helping me take the unit out of the box to check for any screen damage. I didn't expect that service. He also made a great suggestion. Because the unit had been sitting in their warehouse for 10 days it was cold. Be sure to wait for the unit to reach room temperature before firing it up. He said he's heard of screens cracking if you don't let it warm up. I appreciated that! I had scheduled my shipping date and window. Because of the snowstorm, they came the next day. But they never called to tell me when they were coming. I finally reached them locally thanks to a national sales rep. She got me their number, which was not in the phone book, and I contacted them.

I already have a plasma Samsung in the living room but I after giving away my very old (ancient really) box tv that was in the bedroom I decided to research which would be the best tv for me.  Now I wanted a tv that had internet applications so after checking out the Google TV, the LG and the Vizio, I settled on the Samsung 6500 led.  I wanted a tv that had internet capabilities and this tv goes from tv to internet with ease also the clarity is great, even when I'm watching youtube videos.  I wish I would've known prior to buying that I need a lan adapter.  When I read the product description, it had said internet ready and I thought that meant everything was included and internet ready out of the box.  It wasn't a big problem since it's about $52 for a lan adapter at amazon.  I would've bought it together had I known.  I actually didn't get an LG TV because one of the reviews said I would have to purchase something extra for $150 so I could use the internet on the tv and if I'm spending hundreds of dollars already I didn't want to spend and extra hundred so it could do what it's suppose to do in the first place.  The clarity of the Samsung is amazing.  I like the eco friendly options and the upgrades that you can download online for the tv.  The volume is great as well and the TV is so light.  Keep in mind I went without a tv in my bedroom for 5 months because I wanted to make sure I got the right one for me.  I had gone to Best buy and electronic expo, target and even walmart to see the differences between the clarities of the tv's and the Samsung to me is still the best brand for clarity.Even though I had to buy the adapter for my TV, it was well worth it because it wasn't as expensive and I got exactly what I wanted.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Glorious in every way.", "Author": "C.

I'm not an expert and this is my first HD TV but the picture is great!  And the sound is just as good as or better than my old TV.

The chrome grey is a nice touch. However the bezel design reminds me too much of the Cylon ships from Battlestar Galactica.Picture Quality: I came from an LG 47sl80 which is a regular LCD and I didn't notice a significant jump in picture quality overall. However, all told, the PQ is very good and the colors do pop vividly on this set.Media Player: This is the best feature BY FAR on this set. If you plan on using this to play any of your media files (avi, mp4, wmv, flv, etc.) this set will handle it all. I was very impressed by this capability. Even though I returned this set, this is the one regret I have of returning it.Netflix: This was the only app I used and if you have any familiarity with how netflix works on the ps3, they're nearly identical. Also, the processing speed on this is quite remarkable for a tv set.The BAD:Very horrible backlight bleeding, flashlighting, and clouding. This is the main reason I decided to return it. I've heard of it going away after some time as some owners have reported via avsforum, but it was so bad that I didn't think it was worth resting my hopes on and end up not happening. If it was not for this, I would definitely have  kept this tv.Black Levels: I know this may seem contradictory of me to say since I think the PQ overall is good, but the cnet review was really on point in my opinion with respect to black levels. Indeed, this set only manages to produce relatively light black levels, even lighter than some (cheaper) non-led tvs that I've examined.OVERALL: If you plan on using this set mainly for TV viewing (16:9 programming, with no black bars in other words), as your monitor for your htpc, and/or for gaming (xbox/ps3), then I would strongly recommend this set. However if you're like me and plan on using this to enjoy your netflix and blu-ray library for movie watching (where more than half the time film-source material has the black bars), then you better hope you're one of the few that strikes gold in getting a set that does not have the same uneven backlighting, flashlighting, and clouding issues that mine had.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Erick Sandoval \"erf\"", "ReviewID": "R25BGWK0SVIN87", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "so far ive been using this tv for about 4 months and i have to say its great.

Flashlighting cant be seen when watching a movie or playing games. i did notice there is a lag when watching movies maybe a second or two lag that happens once in awhile. if you are the type to notice little things or a perfectionist with your electronics you will notice this but if not you wont even be able to see it. overall if this TV would just fix the lag and ghosting it would be five stars instead of four but the colors and brightness of this tv makes up for the imperfections.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Mark E.

Due to the mediocre sounds from the very thin TV, I ended up buying a sound bar for the tiny room I have it in, which sounds amazing. My favorite features are the built in internet with netflix. You can also download a Samsung file sharing program to your PC and share video, music and pictures over your home network. It works like a charm.Amazon used CEVA to deliver the TV.

Overall, we have been pleased with the TV's performance.  Picture quality is excellent, though we did need to adjust the factory settings to get to a color spectrum that was more to our liking.  We also immediately turned off the 120Hz feature as this is not so much of a feature as it is an annoying distraction.  Some have complained about the edge lit nature of the screen, but generally we have not seen any light bleed in dark scenes.  That said, depending upon the signal source, we have seen some very very minor sharpness issues in certain dark scenes.  Again, this seems to be source dependent (Think House on Bravo (minor issues) vs. House on Fox (no issues)) as it is not a consistent flaw across all channels or sources.The internet connectivity of this TV is also a nice touch.  We've gotten movies from Amazon's VOD service though finding Amazon's movies through Yahoo was a bit cumbersome (Note to Amazon - get your own app on the TV).  We've also used the VUDU movie service, which due to its accessibility and selection is pretty cool.  We did did not get the Samsung proprietary wireless device as we had an Apple Airport Express already around.  We have not had any issues with streaming, even using an 802.11b signal.The one issue with this TV is the sound quality.  It's \"good enough\" for casual TV watching, but has sort of a small/hollow/tinny sound that could be better.  This is mostly due to the size of the TV cabinet which simply can't house big enough speakers.  For sports/movies, run the sound through your home theater, or alternatively, buy a sound bar.  If you are on the fence because of the sound issue, don't be.  It is really a minor complaint in what is ultimately a great TV.Highly recommended.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "I am very impressed with this TV", "Author": "Sir Archer", "ReviewID": "RI6C4XANLFOE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this tv a last week, and have absolutely no issues with it.

From what I have found this is known as flashlighting. The corners are really noticeable and various parts of the screen. It has become very distracting specifically when there are any movements in the screen. I would really like to exchange this to see if it's a set specific problem, but I have seen many of the same reviews all over the place.Build qualityThis set is very sleek, light weight and extremely slim. The stand is a weird design, I would prefer a standard flat stand, but will be mounting it to the wall soon if I can resolve the above issues.Internet appsThese are really cool and work surprisingly well. Streaming hulu and netflix is great. Along with the samsung remote app on the iPhone it makes easy to use. Biggest problem is that the screen setting do not transfer when you switch into the Internet side of the tv, so everything looks weird. Seems like auto motion plus turns back on. I spoke with samsung tech support and they insist that it does not, but I do not agree, I can see it.***UPDATE - I have found the image control menu in the Internet side of the tv and have disabled auto motion plus so everything looks normal. While watching a video press TOOLS on the remote and a menu comes up where you can adjust picture and sound settings.iPhone appSamsung has an iPhone app that let's you control your tv  as long as you are on the same network. This is by far one of the coolest aspects of the tv, no more trying to see the remote in the dark, just use your iPhone or iPod touch. Most apps allow you to use the keyboard so you don't have to figure out which numbers correspond to which numbers on your remote control. It responds extremely well and fast.SummaryI really like the look and functionality of this tv, however the image quality leaves something to be desired.
