They shipped it quickly with free shipping and received within 2 days.The tv is very lightweight for 32\" tv; remarkable how far the tech has come. Setup was very simple. Menu system is extensive for picture controls, PIP, connecting a computer and so on.Currently I use this connected to a Roku 2 for watching HD content from Amazon Prime. I use the custom picture mode. Picture quality is on par with my Panasonic 42\" plasma THX setting. Motion in movies is excellent even as a 60Hz HDTV.Sound is good by itself, but I use it connected to a Bose system via the audio out mini jack which is great for internet music.The bezel is thin and blends away while watching movies which is even nicer. Something I didn't expect or even notice from my other tvs until now.Nicely sized screen for viewing movies from 10 ft away or less.Very happy and would certainly recommend the tv and would buy again. Now considering my next tv to be a larger Sony LED. I've been extremely happy with Panasonic but Sony makes superb tvs with equal picture quality and equal or lower price.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent, sharp, vibrant picture. Minimal Physical presence.", "Author": "amazonreviewer", "ReviewID": "R3916BZ3SNS5IZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this tv. It's everything I remember about having a Sony. The picture is very natural and less \"digitally\" than other tvs I've seen. Setup, menus, remote, inputs, all well designed and thought out. I love the ability to watch content streamed from a USB drive. The feature worked nicely, though I did forget that my usb drive was Mac formatted and it took me a while to figure out why it wasn't working. The set is very minimal and elegant and compliments the room (as much a a tv can I suppose). Viewing angles are excellent side to side and top to bottom. I was worried initially since the angle of the set doesn't adjust vertically but this has been a non issue due to great viewing angles. I was also pleasantly surprised by the great sound of the built in speakers. I normally run everything through my stereo but hardly do so now except for serious movie screening. The speakers do great for most all content and I rarely have the urge to turn on the stereo to watch tv. The size is perfect for us. We wanted a nice big screen to enjoy but not a monster that takes over the whole room and this was a great compromise.Really, the only thing I can think of that I would change is how you adjust the white balance or \"temperature\" of the picture. You have cool, neutral and warm to choose from and to my eyes (and I am an artist and professional photographer with pretty keen sensitivity) the normal setting is too cool, almost as cool as the cool setting. This forced me to choose the warm setting which I found to be a bit too warm but much more to my liking. I have since visually acclimated to the setting and never give it a thought but it did bug me that they couldn't get the normal setting right or else give the consumer some control over this beyond three settings. White balance is a personal choice to a degree and you may prefer the normal or even cool setting so don't let it deter you from buying this stellar TV set. Highly recommended.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Another Sony Outstanding TV", "Author": "Charlie Brown", "ReviewID": "R5GDLS5MIO0U7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to replace a 24 inches, 8 years old Sony LCD 4:3 aspect ratio TV which ran it course (still perfectly fine, just obsolete). I have always being amazed by the picture quality of that non-HDTV, picture was crisp and perfect, colors real and the experience of watching that TV was always a pleasure. So naturally I thought of another Sony to replace it.  Even if Sony always charges a premium, I believe it is justified: I've seen Sonys running side-by-side with Samsungs, Sharps, Vizio, Philips, etc and Sony always have a edge on picture quality, substantial over Samsung for example and just slight over Vizio, but an advantage nevertheless.For this Sony, the price premium was small so for me it was no brainer and I'm not disappointed: image quality is superb, even standard definition programs look razor-sharp and clear, no blur, no lack of black, etc, it is just amazing. And the auto-wide function makes watching SD programming a pleasure, as it will always adjust itself to give you the best watching experience. I have it connected to an Apple TV, as some suggested here it is better to pay about $300 for this TV and $99 for an Apple TV than $400 for a smart or connected TV, you get way more functionality and flexibility with a separate streaming device I think, being it an Apple TV, a Roku or whatever you prefer.And it is when delivering HD content that this TV really excels: Netflix or HBOGo streaming looks amazing, this TV leaves nothing behind, quality is outstanding in every situation I've faced: TV shows, cartoons, movies, news, etc, etc, you name it. This is what Sony is about, straight picture excellence without too many bells and whistles, simplicity and focus on what's really important on a TV which is picture qualityHaving said this, apart from a solid, outstanding image delivery, the rest of this TV is pretty average and even below from what some of the competition offers: only two HDMI ports (at this price range, 3 or 4 ports is the norm), one USB port which I guess is enough, one component input and one antenna connection. That's it. Oh, and one optical audio out which is the bright spot of this simplicity as it sounds really good, even if not really needed as the quality of the built-in speakers is also very good. Taken aside the screen, the rest of the materials used are cheap, thermoformed plastic, it looks OK but not great, and when compared with my old Sony they look subpar. But it is not something that will stand out and being so slim it is not really an issue as it will blend with the rest of the ambient. And I guess all this plastic helps to keep the TV very, very lightLastly, is the issue I'm sure many of you have seriously considered or at least gave some thought about it: 720P vs. 1080p? I did think about  this issue, did some research and agree with most of the experts: at this size 1080p is not a must have unless you sit very close to the TV (I would say 4 feet or less) and even then it will be hard to appreciate a real difference in image superiority from a 1080p. Unless you're a professional or again, sit very, very close to the TV or have superior eyesight which is a possibility, some people do have it; the 720p offered by this TV is excellent. Besides, at this price point and screen size it will very hard t o find a 1080p 32 inches TV, unless it is a connected or smart TV, and those are $100-150 more", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "High quality and good price", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R1XL2ON5OC01WJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since It's a new product, I thought you might find this review a useful one.Despite the fact that sometimes Sony products are more expensive than other companies, such as: Samsung and Toshiba, I'm a big fan of Sony products because of the high quality in products and customer service.

I bought both the 32\" and 40\" versions for my apartment because they were such a good deal! I've always been a big fan of Sony's minimalist design and high quality, and this TV series does not disappoint.While other brands' products scream \"I AM A FANCY TV - LOOK AT ME!\" Sony always does a good job of keeping things elegant and understated. In fact, the only thing on the bezel (other than SONY) is the energyStar certified logo. The controls are cleverly hidden in a recess on the back-right-hand side. This simplicity is also evident in the menu system, which is very easy to navigate, as well as the remote, which is laid out very intuitively with just the right amount of buttons.Picture quality is as good as I expected. I'm mostly streaming things off of my AppleTV, and I have no complaints of black levels or colors being off. I was very glad to see that this TV has a light sensor, which adjusts the TV brightness to the level of light in the room, as well as a digital optical audio out for my sound system. My only gripe is that there are only two HDMI inputs - one in the back and one on the side, but this seems to be par for the course in this price range.As a bonus, Sony Includes a USB port on the side, where you can plug in a thumb-drive or portable hard drive to play music, or view videos and pictures. In my testing, it worked pretty well.

Read the manual for setting it up - pretty straight forward. Tweaked the back lighting and tweaked the equalizer to reduce the \"background\" music so I could hear the dialogue better. (Reduced the 200HZ and increased the high frequency.) Mounted it to an articulating swing arm wall mount (VideoSecu #ML532B, about $26.00). It uses the 100mm x 100mm VESA Mount. I did have to use 4 (four) 1/4\" thick x 1\" outside diameter spacers (w/clearance hole for M4 screw or larger) on the base plate to clear the AC power cord in the rear at the bottom of the TV. The rest of the connections in the rear cleared the base plate with plenty of room. The back of the TV is flat, so no problem mounting the base plate to the back of the TV. Used the M4 x 20mm screws that came with the wall mount to secure the base plate to the back of the TV. We have ATT UVerse, so I set up the ATT remote controller to control the TV - no problem, just followed the ATT on-screen instructions to program in the correct code for the TV. I located the wall stud and used the ST8 x 50mm self tapping screws supplied with the wall mount to mount the arm base plate to the wall. Of course, I did this before mounting the TV to the arm. The TV weighed maybe 10 lbs. so it was easy to lift it and mount it to the arm. Used an HDMI cable to connect from the control box to the back of the TV. The distance of where the TV is to where I am sitting is about 15 feet - I can see the TV picture clearly. I can read the ATT on-screen menu clearly, also.

It's an especially good choice for secondary TV locations, like a guest room or bedroom. Since the introduction of 1080p LED TVs, I have become spoiled. 1080P LED displays are amazing. They are crisper and brighter than the plasmas and florescent-lit TVs that have come before. I'm afraid that one you've seen a 1080p LED display, you won't want anything less. But budget TVs still exist. And \"budget\" today is 720p LED, which is still excellent, when you consider that more than half HDTV channels still only broadcast in 720p. Plus, LED backlights are super bright and can last 10 years or more. This is a lot of TV for under $300.This TV has cost cutting, to be sure. The stand does not allow the monitor to swivel. The speakers are small, and face down so sound is reflected off your furniture. There's not a piece of aluminum to be seen. This is all plastic, and that's fine.I would argue this is a great TV for a kids room, a home office, guest room, or bedroom. There are crisper displays out there (see the 32\" LED 1080p by LG), and there are displays that swivel (Toshiba has a 32\" model with a swivel stand).

Audio is incredible considering the speakers are nearly invisible. If I was gonna be picky I'd like a little more bass but it's not a big deal.

I had to do some research to know what to look for and what features I needed or didn't need. This Sony is excellent for my purposes. The other brands I looked at (mostly Samsung and Toshiba) had the TV sitting on a stand that was several inches high and attached in one place at the bottom center. They looked less than stable in the pictures, and reviews did say they were unstable. This is on a much lower stand, attached in two places, and it's very stable. That would not matter if you're mounting the TV on the wall, of course. The size is perfect for me as it's in a bedroom, being viewed from five or six feet away. It was extremely easy to set up and I have not had to make any adjustments in the sound, color, or anything else. It pulls in more channels than my old TV, using the same antenna. I do wish there were some way to disable the red indicator light when it is off, as it is in a bedroom and the red light bothers me. (You'd think it would occur to the manufacturers that people do put TVs in bedrooms, and you can easily tell if a TV is off, because it's OFF.) I had to put a sticker over it. But that is a minor annoyance and probably every TV made now has the same off light. Overall, I recommend this TV. Another great product from Sony!One more point: A couple of the other reviews said the product arrived in a damaged package, and one said the TV itself arrived shattered and they had to return it for another. Amazon certainly will exchange it in such a case, but I just want to say that mine arrived in perfect condition, both product and packaging.

I had an old RCA combo (tv/dvd) set and it just stopped working (only two years old) so I was in need of a new tv. I'm not super technologically inclined (English Lit PhD) so I did a ton of research about smaller affordable tvs and eventually narrowed it down to this Sony or an LG. I nixed the smart tvs because I have a Roku and that's fine for me...I don't need a remote control with dedicated buttons for channels that may not exist in a few years. I wanted to make sure I got a tv with an audio outlet port and the Sony edged out the LG with its speakers...plus, I ran my thought process by my two much more technology inclined brothers and they agreed. Got the tv and was shocked at how light it was (carried home under one arm) and it was ridiculously easy to set up on my little corner tv stand. The picture, to me, is amazing...much better than my RCA unit and another reviewer mentioned the edge beveling fading into the background as you watch tv...and while I had no clue what it meant when I read it, I now do...the beveling is so thin that it does seem to disappear into the dark background on tv shows and movies...which amazes me. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. If you're on a budget and need a smaller tv then this might be for you (+ it'll make a great bedroom tv or kitchen tv when I'm not so poor lol). Two things: I would add on an extra warranty AND be sure to check out the review on CNET for this tv. I'll update if anything significant happens.

So, for example, hook up a DVD player, ROKU, whatever to the TV using HDMI and then use an optical cable from the TV to your receiver and you will get 5.1 dolby digital sound. You do not have to have a separate feed from the device to your receiver. Apparently, most TV's will not do this - awesome. This feature made the TV perfect for me.

(The extra 3 inches is definitely noticeable).Anyway, this is a very attractive, no nonsense looking tv. Simple and straightforward in design and implementation.The picture is the big thing here. It is exceptional. Extremely natural. But I would not recommend using the pre-sets. Like every TV I have seen, the presets are too saturated, can have too much sharpness, etc. Manually adjust the various picture settings and you will be amazed what this set can deliver. Now room lighting, the picture source and personal preference play a definite role in setting the picture, but below are the settings I use. Try these as a starting point. Then play around a little to see the different effects. This works out well for my environment and if you are using a pre-set you should see quite an improvement.

I spent $10 for an HDMI switchbox so now I actually have 5 HDMI inputs. So no big deal there.I am a \"cable cutter\". I dropped cable a few years ago and use over the air for \"regular TV\". I live on a hill in San Francisco and apparently am in a good reception area. I made a homemade antenna from a coax cable. I stripped one end and taped it to an aluminum foil cardboard tube that had a few layers of foil around it. Ran it along the wall and placed on a window sill. It is essentially invisible. I ran through the channel scan and came up with 52 digital channels, many in HD. The channels come through rock steady with excellent resolution.I have the sound running into an A/V receiver so will not comment on the sound from the built-in speakers, but the majority of reviews seem to praise the built-in speakers. The sound from my receiver is excellent. One feature I love is the Pic Off button (just below Input on top left of remote). When you hit it the picture goes off but the TV/sound remains on.

I mean if your looking for a TV with fantastic picture quality without all the bells and whistles of a \"SMART TV\" then look no further you have found it. Now yes I'm discussing the smallest of the three TVs Sony has in this line and it is a 720p, I was worried about this even though I know its been said you can not see the difference between 720p and 1080p on 32\" and under. Well, this 720p TV looks better than the 48\" LED 1080p Samsung I have and the Samsung looks very good. Not only is the HD quality of the picture incredible on this TV, but the advertised 60hz with120hz motionflow XR absolutely makes a difference and I could notice it right away. So anyways this obviously wasn't meant to be a technical review but an honest review from my perception on how the TV looks. I'm a pretty snobby person when it comes to quality HDTV and this TV is just incredible and I can't believe I got it for $275.00! Easily better picture than the 400-500 32\" 1080p tvs i was considering before finding this. Don't hesitate, buy this TV if you don't need the smart features. I'm going to buy the 50\" version now to replace the Samsung.

Set-up is quick, but there are so many options that the experienced consumer like me can go back and tinker for a long time in all the menus.On the plus side: Only 2.2cents per day to operate; amazingly light(12 lb.s); slim cabinet; easy to use remote control.  It has 'Clear Voice' which is intended to emphasize speech but is helpful only in this function.On the negative side: It DOES work with computers but does NOT have RGB so it's useless for my PC at the moment. I could buy a PC-TV card, but am slightly surprised at this omission.  Also, compared to my Toshiba, it does not do well with 2nd rate signals.  Unless you have HDMI, you'll have an acceptable picture but nothing approaching 'hi def'.  I have it on a simple video/audio RCA connection and its picture is fine, but far from stellar...The major shortcoming on the set, and virtually all sets short of the premium large ones is sound.  A wafer thin plastic cabinet does not provide a means of resonance nor of having proper speakers. As a 2nd set for a room, it's OK; for a primary use set, you should add supplemental speakers, etc.The key thing to remember is no RGB computer hookup.

Very slim, very sleek, the TV itself looks really, really good. The TV comes with a stand that is super stable, so you don't have to worry about ruining your furniture by drilling in holes or anything like that.

Immediate love.  Set up easily with cable through HDMI, fits great in space, best stand among competing models (matters with rambunctious pets), great picture and sound.  Much better at 720p than the 1080p ViewSonic set it replaced and which was a few years old.  I have a LG Net box with Blu-ray, and Blu-ray looks fantastic as do normal DVDs.  I waited a month before posting this feedback to check everything out, but it's all good.Before going with this set, I compared with other brands and models, particularly with Samsung.  Glad I stayed with Sony, which has always made great monitors and teevees.  My old portable BR Trinitron is still going fine after more than 20 years.  I want to thank those Amazon customers who answered my Qs posted here before making the purchase and who were quite helpful.If you want a basic LED HDTV and don't need a lot of bells and whistles, this model is highly recommended.  The price is quite competitive for the quality and reputation of the brand.  There isn't much genuinely very good to excellent with resolution and sound, and overall style, in the 32\" and under size at a very good to excellent price.  Something else I considered is the release date.  As of late 2013, this model wasn't quite a year old.  The Samsungs and other brands were a bit older.  My sense is that they were marked down for the holidays, since new models will be released in early 2014.  The technology under the hood on this model is likely better for the price (given the competitive market and fast changing specs), since whenever Samsung updates their smaller sized sets again a higher price will result.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love my Sony!!", "Author": "toots", "ReviewID": "R1J8PDI4V3S4N9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best picture evar!

I am used to all the frills on the back of my 40 inch Sony and found the 32 inchs are fairly similar with ports, etc. After reading the manual there are 3 HMDI's. The one on the side has a duel function and can be used for smart phones or as HMDI. You need to turn off the Smart phone setting in the menu from what I gather. I did call Sony support this week end before purchase to make sure Windows DVD media from my computer could be played on it. No problem. The Sony DVP-SR210P DVD player compliments this TV if your not into blueray. The sound, picture, and look is beautiful. I like the fact it has an antenna port on the back for over the air Broadcasting. Antennaweb.org can be of help if interested. It's a keeper after looking at all the choices.

The display is solid, but you will notice uneven lighting on solid areas of color.Downsides include: a limited number of inputs, a pretty cheap stand, and rather insubstantial remote control.PIP only works with PC inputs, you can't play a DVD and have a PIP window open with the tuner.Since I use a DVR that takes one input.  The Roku another.  Now I'm left with just component and composite inputs I can't use.The built in tuner is stronger than that on my DVR, but that's a moot advantage as I only watch through the DVR.The media playback and slideshow functions are weak.  You have to separately browse for pictures and for videos.  You can't readily pause/skip forward/skip back or zoom during a slideshow.  And you must treat each folder separately even if the pictures are all from the same camera taken on the same day.There's a light sensor, but you can't configure how sensitive it is.  I find it makes the screen too dark, but turning the feature off results in a screen that's too bright.I appreciate the buttons on the back for volume and input switching... however... the button I most often need to push is \"format\", which is a remote only feature.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV", "Author": "R.

I bought this TV for my son's bedroom. So far I am on the fence about this TV. The picture is not what I expected it to be. It is a good picture, but the previous Samsung TV I had purchased outshot Sonys picture in the same price range. Another problem is that you can't switch from HDMI Input back to Cable. You actually have to go into setup and switch from Analog to Cable and the picture magically then pops up. I plan on calling sony again to try and rectify the input problem and if I can, I will keep this TV. If not, I will be on the hunt for a new one. If you want the Sony name with a \"good\"(NOT outstanding) picture quality, then this is a good TV. You can't beat the price, hence a slightly lower picture quality, although I think there is better picture quality TV's out there for the price, but you lose the Sony name.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't go wrong with a Sony product", "Author": "Mendy", "ReviewID": "R572C8E4IC7IU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Sony KDL-32R400A 32-Inch 60Hz 720p LED HDTV arrived on time and in good condition.

The TV that was in this box had scratches along the frame and looked very used.  I asked for a replacement; but I was beyond the 30 day marker due to the nature of the gift not being opened.

The TV was easy to setup and very lightweight, however, got it hooked up to DirecTV High Def and the picture was somewhat blurry.  Amazon said it was an LED TV (more money than the LCD's).  The box said LED, the sticker on the back of the TV said LCD and the documentation said LCD.  I read some reviews that said to wait a day or two, which I did.  No better.  Also, the black was not a deep black, but faded in and out from black to somewhat darker grey.  No amount of color adjustment seemed to help.  Returned the TV, the Sony DVD Blu-Ray player, and HDMI cables that were also on the order, with it as well.  First Amazon CS Rep took the information and said she would check into it and call me back.  Two days later, still nothing, so I called Amazon.  Twice got someone from a foreign country and finally asked to speak to a rep in the United States.  Got Beverly in the U.S. and she was very helpful.  She immediately sent a return shipping label via e-mail.  Packed up the whole thing, with original packaging and took to UPS store for return but deliveries didn't go out until Monday (this was Saturday).  Since I was told that I wouldn't get a credit until the package was received in their warehouse, I wanted it shipped out ASAP.  Took to the Phoenix UPS hub early Monday morning and it was only open from 4-7 pm.  Really?  Ended up going back to the UPS Store.  The whole shipping thing was a nightmare.
