This is it. Wow, if you want a 60in lcd, this is it. The color is incredible, I actually compared the color to a non quattron tv and you can see the difference in depth of yellow.The contrast is pretty impressive as well for an LCD. Dark knight on blue ray looks so good, you can see the make up mistakes! What a great tv, would highly recommend it. It is very light and super thin, looks beautiful even when its off.Great deal.", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "thpsrulr", "ReviewID": "RJJQY72E2ZPM2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this tv and the picture quality and screen size are awesome. I have had other Sharp TV's in the past (picture tube & LCD) and this tv stands in line to be a great tv that will last for years just like their past tvs. Just make some adjustments to the picture and setup some internet widgets and you are on your way. I do wish they had more internet functionality and the video on USB drives option though. Otherwise it is a great tv, especially when you can get a good deal on it!", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Unit failed in 4 months", "Author": "michael p sprott", "ReviewID": "R2KAX50ANU2QEO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV 11/13/10, on 3/1/11 the power supply went out and now I'm waiting for the part and service technician to fix it.

It took sharp 3 weeks to get me a refurbished TV and this one has a large chunk of something in the middle of the screen, and a MUCH more uneven backlight than my first TV.  The people I spoke to on the phone did not take sufficient notes so that the people who were supposed to review my claim didn't even know what my issue was.  I had to call back again and speak with the reviewer directly to \"fill him in\".  Overall I am EXTREMELY disappointed in Sharp and will NOT be purchasing another Sharp product in the future.  I liked the features they offered on the TV, but when the company is such a pain to deal with, and you have to wait 3 weeks to get your TV fixed/replaced, that is just not acceptable.  Besides that, I now have a refurb with a flawed screen.  My suggestion?  DO NOT BUY SHARP PRODUCTS.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "So Far, So Good", "Author": "W. Kendrick", "ReviewID": "R3BQ8R4UA76IP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually buy Samsung LED TV sets but could not find one in the size and at the price I was willing to pay. Ordered the set and had it delivered via freight truck within a week. I could not be happier with the delivery and the picture quality. The screen resolution is especially good with the 120hz refresh rate. A guest commented how the people glided across the screen. The set is located in a semi-dark area and still have plenty of contrast for good viewing. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a larger picture and good contrast. I will be purchasing an extended warranty since replacing or fixing a unit of this size can be somewhat overwhelming.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "best thing I have purchased in years", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "RUVJ8KDNWFK57", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my favorite thing that I own.  I love it.  I recently had problems with a generator burning up my electrical equipment and was very happy when the surge protector prevented my Sharp TV from dying.  I have only owned it for about 6 months, but I have  had several other LED TV owners tell me that it has a better picture then theirs.  A lot of the HD programming looks practically 3D.  I can't say anything about endurance because I haven't had it long enough but if it last 10-12 years, I will have to say it is the best thing I have purchased.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price!", "Author": "FlyByTurkey", "ReviewID": "R1EWF80RWQEP7E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is definately a great TV for under $2000 for a 60\" TV. The TV was purchased for our conference room. It's a little on the heavy side (around 125 lbs.) but what do you expect from a TV this big. The weight is mainly due to the glass screen. It is also a crazy thin TV. Only a little over an inch thick I believe (minus the stand).The video quality is pretty good. The only issues I have seen so far is the \"glowing\" areas when the TV is displaying black. Well, who the heck watches a black picture. You don't notice it when you are watching anything unless the screen goes black (those sudden pauses inbetween commercials or scene changes). Other than that the picture is quite nice. No real noticable change between the 3 color pixel and 4 color pixel televisions.The audio quality is the same as expected with any flat screen television. If you want good sound, get a surround sound system.This TV doesn't play any video formats through its USB port like some TVs so if you want something like that, get a Samsung TV. A lot of their TVs play video formats through theirs.Ummm... did I mention this TV is freaking huge!All in all this TV is very big and has a nice picture for the price you will pay. Sharp makes probably the cheapest 60\" TV's there are right now.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome picture", "Author": "M.G.", "ReviewID": "RY4ZDLDX545MA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "been using it for about 2 weeks.  the picture is crystal clear and vivid.  you just need to have a good cable signal, and HD programming preferred.  blue Ray is incredible also.  never thought i would buy a Sharp TV, but if it will last, then i made the right choice.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Joseph Torre \"Mac Man\"", "ReviewID": "R2D50X9WU7AHHI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best TV I have ever owned by far!

It has happened twice in two years, the first set died at 11 months, the second replacement unit died with the same error in 13 months. They would not let me extend the warranty on the replacement set, so it goes to the heap. The error code is one short and one long blink, it means the panel is not functioning.

I bought this TV in December 2010, it died in January 2011 for the first time and took Sharp over a month to get a replacement out.  Here it is a year after the first replacement and it is dead again.  Sharp obviously recognizes an issue with the TV as they let us skip the entire replacement process that we dealt with last time and we were offered a refund process.

Turned it on maybe 10 times total.  Flash forward to fall 2011.  I finally get time to really play with the TV and I notice a 'spiderweb' pattern across the entire screen.  Almost like oil and water mixed, however the weird pattern was stationary and would stay the same across all inputs.  Called up the company I bought it from and they gave me Sharp's #.  Called Sharp and after walking through a billion steps of resetting everything, they ask me to take pics and they would evaluate the problem.  A week or three later, I get told that it isn't fixable and I would get a replacement.  However, because the TV was older than six months, they would only replace it with a refurbished unit!@#>$@  So I basically bought a refurbished TV at a new TV price.  Moral of this story?

Almost like when You take a high resolution image on a pc go from 32-bit color to 16 color mode.  If I get service like the other guy who posted here with a problem, I will be done for life with Sharp Electronics.Flash Forward one week:Aquos Advantage eventually got a technician from a local electronics repair company over to my house.  He first replaced the main board on the TV.  That did not solve the problem.  He proceeded to replace what he called the \"T Con\".  The service referred to the board as an \"LCD Control\" board.  It was located near the base of the unit.  Once he replaced that smaller board, the TV was as good as new.  Hopefully, that is the end of my troubles with the unit.  I've had the TV for nearly 3 months now.  It was out of order for about 8 days, but I am very happy with it otherwise.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good price but is it too good to be true?", "Author": "Cheezr", "ReviewID": "RJEC4W8XSHK4J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My mother just bought one of these (on my advice) and we set it up last week.the good: menus are actually easy to use, remote is also good.the bad: caucasian skin tones look yellow, sorry but i was not able to adjust this out without distorting other colors.asian skin tones looked good and african american skin tones looked like caramelOther than that not minor flaw it is a very nice tv set but i can not get used to all those white folks looking jaundiced!", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "GOOD  TV BUT PRICE TOO HIGH", "Author": "SHENG", "ReviewID": "R1PW0NRXYAFAOC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "[...]  THIS  TV  HAS VERY VIVID COLOR, GOOD CONTRAS.
