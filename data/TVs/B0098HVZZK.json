We now own 3 Hisense TV's.  I've always been a big fan of Samsung and trying a brand that was new to the TV market was a little scary; however, for all the bells and whistles that this TV offers stacked up against another brand with same features - this TV was half the cost!  We've had the 46\" Hisense TV for about 6 months.  The 65\" and a 42\" Hisense, we've had for a little over a month. So far so good. Plug and play out of the box, but those who like to tweek I think just about everything in this TV can be!  Also, we love all the inputs and we are using most of them!Can't really comment on Wi-fi features as we have ethernet wired in the house and the 65\" has our media center computer hooked to it.  TV sound is OK but let's face it - if you are considering a 65\" TV you would likely have some sort of home theater system.  Love the slim design and frame.3D features are awesome!  Even the 2D to 3D conversion looks great!  It adds more depth to a 2D movie. But WOW - watch a movie that was actually filmed in 3D and things jump out at you!  You can tell the difference between a movie that was \"remade\" in 3D versus a movie that was filmed in 3D.  Not the TV's fault by any means - just sharing there is a difference.  Unfortunately there are not a lot of movies to choose from at this point that were filmed in 3D.  Avatar and Step UP Revolution (the 4th movie in Step Up series) were filmed in 3D.  There are some others but these two are my favorites for 3D effects.One thing to mention - the 65\" is so new that Hisense employees don't know much about it yet.  The TV shipped with 2 pairs of active 3D glasses model # FPS3D06.  They have active shutters and run on batteries that are not rechargeable.  If you want additional pairs of the same model, you will have to order from China.  I found them on E-Bay.  If you want rechargeable glasses (which we prefer) call Hisense USA and order model FPS3D02.  These are interchangeable with the FPS3D06 that come with the TV.  If you see on the internet somewhere that model FPS3D05 is compatible with the 65\" TV - beware they are not!  The 05's are RF glasses and do work with our 42\" Hisense.  The 65\" TV transmits an IR signal for 3D glasses.We are not usually \"trail blazers\" on new technology but when we saw the price of this TV compared to other brands with same features we thought we'd give them a try.  To this point we have not been disappointed. Exceptional TV for an exceptional price!", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "High quality 65\" tv, budget price, but with motion issues", "Author": "Jon Langevin", "ReviewID": "R1I4R472ZO4H35", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased the Hisense 65\" at $1499, can't beat that price (free shipping on prime).Comes with VUDU and Netflix apps, no Amazon (love Amazon video, hopefully that's added soon).TV has a solid base, quite heavy actually, requires assembly. Assembly was relatively simple, and swivel on base works quite well.Watched Tron: Legacy in 3D on the tv, looked amazing. That movie has heavy use of blacks, and some great 3D effects, all came across quite well.Love the remote. TV was easy to set up, easy to use.Screen is apparently made by Hitachi, which explains the high quality. There's nothing about this TV to suggest low quality or budget, aside from the brand name that people won't recognize :-)Only complaints that I have:- No Amazon Instant Video app (not a major negative, since I can watch via game consoles)- No setting to disable the \"soap opera effect\" (motion interpolation). According to google search, other users have found same issue, they contacted support, and were sent a USB stick with an updated firmware which provides setting to disable motion interpolation. I'm contacting support later today to make same request.- Remote has no keyboard, which is almost necessary when using a \"Smart\" tv.EDIT (5-21-2013):  ** Dropping score to 3 starsWhile I love the size and picture quality of this tv (and hell, the price was awesome), I'm on the verge of returning it to Amazon.While watching Southland Season 5 via VUDU (on PS3), I'm noticing problems with motion stutter/jutter/lag.This issue is due to Motion Interpolation being forced on (no setting to turn it off), so while sports & racing looks phenomenal, TV programs tend to suffer.Hisense CSRs are responsive and try to be helpful, but there is no firmware update for this model yet, so there's no way for me to turn off motion interpolation to fix video playback.I'm waiting to hear back a final response from Hisense, at which point I'll decide whether it's worthwhile to return the tv.What sucks is, there's no similarly featured LED tv at the same price on Amazon. I may need to switch over to Plasma, since that doesn't suffer motion issues...EDIT (6-5-2013):I ended up returning the TV to Amazon, replacing it with a Vizio 70\" (2d).There aren't enough (good) 3D movies out currently, so losing 3D won't affect me.The Vizio tv operates great though. No issues with the \"Soap Opera effect\". Theoretically I would experience the effect if I turned Vizio's motion setting up, but leaving it on the default low setting doesn't give me the same poor experience as I noticed with Hisense.TV broadcasts, DVDs, Blurays, and streamed HD movies, all play back properly, and look great.Shame the Hisense couldn't deliver the same, I did like that TV, but Vizio's app support is better, the remote has a keyboard built in, and picture looks great.Kudos to Amazon on their excellent support staff, for letting me easily swap out tvs.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "all hisense televisions are junk!", "Author": "david flynn", "ReviewID": "R1K0XN32CTU23I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this is my second tv from this company and the second one to fail to panel malfunction. my last one was a 50k360g and was sent in around thanks giving last year and i still have not recived my refund. my last model was a 2012 model and they didnt have parts in 2013 . so i thought to myself maybe i just got a bad one and bought a new one but sure enough 4 weeks and 3 days later this model fails from the same problem as the last one i had and because hisense has the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life i brought it back to walmart and sat there until they took it back.  in my opinion this brand is complete trash and should be pulled pulled from all stores immediately.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "not a usa brand to buy yet.", "Author": "Keith w Taylor", "ReviewID": "R124WOOSX3XWXE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture is great.

So then starts the back and forth on a supposed UPS claim. Another 3 weeks go by and several calls to Hisense with a threat of an attorney, they tell me that UPS denied the claim.

After setting up the tv and messing around with the settings I had come to the conclusion that I more or less got what I had paid for. A 55inch 3D tv from an off brand. The picture isn't as sharp as it could be, the tv probably needs a sound bar and the 3D function isn't a strong point.This is a smart TV, but connecting the wifi was a bit tricky, I had to do a lot of troubleshooting. Also, after having the tv for about a month, I haven't been able to use the pandora app. The netflix app works fine and has a direct access button from the remote which is nice. However, this tv does not have the amazon instant video app which would be nice.Overall this tv is a 3/5, at least for the price I paid.

I haven't been able to eliminate the back light bleeding using contrast/brightness/color settings.  It does not seem to be a mfr defect (and I'm not able to detect any dead pixels or anything indicating the product was damaged during shipping).  The unit is so solid and heavy that I don't want to even try to get it exchanged (took three people to safely get it out of the box and set up).Half-a-star off due to lack of availability of extra active glasses in the US that work with this TV (found the right kind through trusted sellers out of China for $12-18 a piece, including shipping), but have been waiting for over a month for them to arrive (and still no word/tracking info).  The one or two US middle-men out of US have a 400+% mark-up, which is a no-go.  (Hisense should make the compatible glasses available through their site at a reasonable, but not outrageous mark-up.)As a side note, the included glasses work very well (even over prescription glass), but are very light and flimsy, so I can see them getting scratched, bend and break easily.  If I could easily buy backups for $15/ea and not have to wait months to get them, the lightness of the glasses would actually be a huge plus over typical active glasses I've used in the pass.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Adam Allgood", "ReviewID": "RNQUGPW6UQWRB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A Very bright picture....loads and play Netflix really well.

After 6 months I get a black screen.  We call Hisense customer service department and they mail us a parts package based on what they believe the problem was. After a week or 2 we receive the package and call Hisense who schedules a repair man to come repair the TV 2 weeks after that. When the repair man arrives he informs us that they sent the wrong parts. He mentioned that he could repair the TV because he knew the problem.  But he was not allowed to work on certain problems per Hisense request. He also mentioned that he's worked on a lot of Hisense TV's and thinks they were made to fail after 3 or so years so that people would need another one. Of course that's his opinion. Next Hisense wants us to send the TV in. They mail us a postage label for UPS which we waited another 2 weeks for and never receive. After calling back multiple times one of the customer service rep informs us that we can print the label after we receive it via email. By this time I ask to speak to a supervisor to request a refund. They tell me that one will call me back. After another week we call back to find out their district manager who was going to call me was on vacation.  Won't be back til Monday. (5 more days). But he calls back later that day. He refused to refund the TV and says send it in for repair.  The whole process would be another 3 weeks.

We tried the 3D once, and it was decent, even in the 2D->3D mode (which I had no expectations of working). The bad thing about the glasses is they have NO indicator of charge/charging, or even if they are On/Off, other than putting them on, mashing buttons and waiting to see if there is a visual difference.

When I ordered it, the reviews were very high. However, recently the reviews have been lower. I think the people who rated it low expected something that would generally cost 4 times or more.I don't use cable for my TV. I use Antenna, soon to try Netflix, but also home brewed videos.The quality on the antenna is exceptional. I live on the outskirts of a major metro area, and It picked up more stations than I had on my previous television/CV box. If you are using Antenna, you do not need a converter box any longer.The interface to set it up is simple. As long as you have basic technical knowledge, you won't have problems. I plan on setting up a NAS, and am hoping that it will not be too complex to get it to see it. If I remember I will update this review when that time comes.If there was one complaint I would make, it would be assembling the stand. The 2nd set of screws you put in did not align. I got it as close as I could and they would not go in completely. The screws got stripped, and I had to use some spare ones I had at home(slightly smaller head), which seemed to work fine. If you have this problem, then when you put in the last set of screws(5 I believe), they will be misaligned, and more than likely the stand will not be stable. I can't say how mounting it to a wall will be, since I didn't do it, but I think it would be easier, as long as you have assistance.Other than that, issue, the picture quality is very good. Like I said, I use antenna. If the station you connect to is borderline to where you are located, you will have issues where the picture gets jumbled or even completely cutoff. That is normal for any TV using antenna. It also picked up more stations than my previous convertor box did. If you use cable, Netflix, NAS, or another type of interface, I am sure the picture will be as good, if not better.One final note: If you have kids, or animals, and plan to use the stand, try to find something you can mount the TV to a stud, so if it does get hit, it will not falloff and get cracked, or worse.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "FEEL cheated", "Author": "Barbara Woitalla", "ReviewID": "RY5G18UQL8O2X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV is of good quality, But when it comes down to the what we ordered I think you took advantage of us.

The screen is edge lit which is phenomenal 98% of the time. In dark screen the edge-lit corners are brighter than the rest of the screen noticeably. It is actually nice but will bother some people. The stand is awesome. The mounting profile on the back is small and this TV will actually mount to wall stand that are too small to support it. To be safe a new wall bracket should probably be bought and mounted. The screen is a bulletproof piece by Hitachi. Hi-sense USA are the people to call with any problems, or to order additional glasses. Just to be safe since the glasses models for the different spec'd TV's vary wildly in design and technology used for 3d. They are a Chinese company in case that bothers you. The quality aesthetics and functionality all feel south Korean though so you shouldn't worry. The only fear i have with this TV is longevity. That has not been proven to me and only time with give me that experience. If it is soon, i will re-post. Enjoy the TV it is worth the money. Samsung models are double the price and not THAT much better.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "best picture ever", "Author": "carl carlentini", "ReviewID": "R15SOE9QMY88GF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sit 7 feet away from the 55 inch hisense,and it is the best picture ever.Amazon got the tv to me quickly and on time.The 3d is awsome.

I have the Hisense 55T710DW55\". Nice size and fills up my cabinet nicely however that's where it ends. It almost looks like a Samsung looking at the base and design of the Tv when it's off but thats the only thing it borrowed from Samsung. Keep in mind I'm comparing this Tv to my 3 year old Samsung 46\" 640. This Tv displays letters that are not crisp and sharp compared the the Samsung. Does not seem to have the same depth of field either. Cannot handle SD signals ( or over the air ) very well and the aspect shrinks ....however on the Samsung ....it handles it quite well......so far it has only shrank one channel compared to the Hisense which hits everything under 720 hard!!! Try enlarging the picture and the letters get even more blurrier than before. You are in between a rock and a hard place trying to set this up......I am not use to this. Let move on to the 3D feature of this Tv which ( The Samsung looks like it displays in 3D on the regular settings compared to this model.) is easy to turn on ( The 3D feature )but trying to get those glasses charged and trying to pair this to em .......I've been at it all day ( Sat ) since about 7am and I still haven't gotten a full charge to pair em to the Tv but when looking thru them ( seemingly uncharged ) the picture was not so blurry but the was not the incredible picture I was expecting either. I would strongly suggest you check this out in person.The app section sucks majorly...the only good thing is it has a built in netflix app so you are view you movies without having to hookup and external box but you will need to add a sound bar for sure.....the sound is hollow and thin...........but hey....what do you expect when you spend under $650 to purchase a Tv? It's not worth the regular price in my opinion.....look at other brands and get more bang for your buck!!!", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wireless doesn't work at all. Otherwise a nice TV", "Author": "D", "ReviewID": "R2IZTGNQNLMAGF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It has a great picture. The 3D is a little annoying to have to setup and the glasses need to be charged. You only get two and so for our whole family to watch i'll need to pick up another two (quick search shows anywhere from $15 to $99 per).Honestly i really like this TV but one of it's big selling features for me was that i wouldn't have to switch to another device to use Netflix or other apps this handles. The problem is the wireless feature doesn't work at all. I have my Laptop, Wii, Dvd player and other devices all able to find my wireless AP but not the TV.I'll update again after i find out what support is willing to do. I have not tried wiring the device with Ethernet cable nor do i plan to as i don't want additional wires.UPDATE: They sent a new board in the mail. A local guy installed it and turned it on. At first it still didn't work but then for some reason unplugging it and turning it on again fixed it.Netflix worked but to get Pandora working i had to update the firmweare (took about 10 minutes). Funky icons the first time it booted after update but then i powered it off and on again and it now has correct app images and Pandora worked.The only real issues with the TV is it takes a while to start up. Flips between the red led for power and the white glow light at the bottom can be 10 seconds before i see the Hisense logo. Also i still need to buy 2 extra 3D glasses so the family can all enjoy it together.Moved this up to 4 stars from 3 when the wireless wasn't working.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great except \"No ap\" Error when connecting to wifi & sound difference", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "R3M9DZ9KPMFWB5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love the screen quality. It looks wonderful (haven't even tried 3D or Bluray yet)! It takes a little longer than other TVs to get turned on, but that's not a problem for me, it isn't a long wait. It looks beautiful. It is very light and easy to swivel on my mount.I enjoy the sound sometimes... it seems to depend on what I'm watching. When I'm watching DirecTV I don't need the volume up much, but if I'm watching something from Amazon Instant Video or Netflix through my Xbox, I have to turn the volume up quite a bit to hear it. I wonder if this would be solved by a new HDMI cable or by accessing directly through the \"Smart TV\" Netflix app.Problem with accessing Apps directly is that when I try to detect a wifi network (following the instruction manual that came with it), it tells me \"No ap.\"  I'm assuming that means No Access Point. This TV should support Wifi and all of my other devices can find my Wifi no problem. The TV doesn't even do the search for Wifi networks.I will be contacting their support VERY SOON. I will update based on my response from their support team and the help I get. If the sound was more consistent and the Wifi worked it would be 5 stars for me.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "no audio hook up", "Author": "mary", "ReviewID": "R23Y1CPQ4TCS7M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "great picture one really bad thing no way to hook up home theater system this is a major flaw thinking about return before you buy look at the connections there is none for home theater called support they said same thing this is bad.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buying in unhappy", "Author": "Long le", "ReviewID": "R1H52T8WYDE4UV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV , thinness , good shape , looking nice , and new technology, but there are not fairness on adverting that posted on Amazon , (920 x 1080 full HD 120Hz, 3D, Smart edge-lit LED3D Active with 2 pair glasses included, Energy Star 5.34 HDMI connections)when we got this TV from shipping coupes , the TV was missed some parts ,and manufacturer sent us only 1 pair of 3D glassesthere are some problem in their business , but we don't want to issue any more thing to discuss with them , or return it to them .", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "READ THIS THE NIGHTMARE WILL HIT YOU IF YOU BUY", "Author": "TIGER", "ReviewID": "R25DTHTMWX92DH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM HISENSE I COULD GO THROUGH MY STORY BUT IT IS UP TO YOU BUT BEWARE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't buy HiSense TV", "Author": "John D.", "ReviewID": "R2V2CBC6957XRG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HiSense has the worst customer service.
