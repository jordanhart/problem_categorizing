{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice 12v TV", "Author": "Trent", "ReviewID": "R17THCX6S9ANWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for use in the fish house.  I wanted something I could run directly off of 12v as to minimize the draw on the battery (didn't want to have to rely on a DC converter).  I had never heard of the brand prior to research so was a little skeptical but went for it anyways.Picture Quality: 4/5The picture quality is pretty good, I have no complaints in that area.  I read others that complained about the black levels but to be honest this hasn't been an issue for me at all, and I consider myself fairly picky.  I have used both a UHF antenna and cable and both look very nice on this TV.  Colors are bright and image is very crisp.  I used this as a computer monitor as well and the picture also looked more than satisfactory.Sound Quality: 2/5Sound quality is pretty poor in my opinion.  There is absolutely zero bass and sounds a bit tin can like.  If I was using this as my primary television I would immediately invest in some form of external speaker.  Because my TV's purpose is portability (hence the 12v) and using in a fish house I'm not overly concerned with the sound quality.  While the sound is barely adequate I can't honestly give more than 2 out of 5 for sound though, it just isn't' there.  I suspect this may have something to do with trying to minimize power consumption by using small speakers that don't draw much juice.Power Consumption: 5/5I have been very impressed with how long I can run this TV straight off a 12v battery.  It draws less juice than my small fan and trailer light bulb.  I've ran the TV for 12 hours plus and still been going strong.  When a battery does start to die the first thing you loose is the sound.  The image itself works fine.Quality: ?/5I've only been using this TV for 50 or so hours so I don't think it's fair to rate the quality yet but I did have an issue with the USB and SD card reader.  Mine didn't work right out of the box.  This happens to be a feature I'll never use so I didn't complain to the seller or worry about it but I thought it only fair to note.The menu is simple and easy to navigate.  Not a lot of options and adjustments for the techy geeks out there but enough to get what you need.Overall a nice little TV that runs on 12v or regular AC with an included adapter.  I have no regrets with the purchase and would recomend it to anybody looking for a TV for their Truck/Van/Camper/Fish house, etc.EDIT on 11/13/12:  TV is still going strong.  We used it on a family road trip in the back of our car (strapped it between the front seats) and the kids loved it.  I also use it in my garage on a regular basis.  TV is still going strong and I still have no regrets on the purchase.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the Price!", "Author": "Berto", "ReviewID": "R24827O7DEY9M6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV for our travel trailer and overall we are very happy with the TV.  The picture quality is good and the build in DVD player does exactly what is supposed to do.  Our primary criteria for buying a unit was that it could run on either 12v DV or 110 AC.  There are not too many units on the market that can do both.  The built in TV tuner works great.  I can pull anywhere from 15 to 20 digital off the air tv stations.  Do not get to hung up on the 1080P spec.  The built in DVD player can only output 480 lines of resolution and it's extremely hard to notice any difference in picture quality between 720p and 1080p on any tv less than 42\" diagonal anyway.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Neat little LED TV", "Author": "Karl", "ReviewID": "R3GUXF829XWAX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Florida experiences occasional power issues... lightning, hurricanes, and power shortages.  This LED TV works great on 12 V or 110 V; both cables included.  Tuner works fine for cable (analog or digital QAM) and with off air signals.  Just can't connect both at once, have to select which connection is in use in the set up guide.  Has standard search and program menu for finding channels.  Channels can be hidden when stepping through if you desire.In this viewing area, Comcast has moved to digital basic... the channels look much better on this TV than the \"free\" converter they offer.  Off air sensitivity is very good with external antenna.  Network off air HD signals display crisp and with bright colors.  Black and contrast settings IMHO appear reasonable.  Display surface is matte finish, good for reducing window or lighting glare.An additional nice feature is the built in DVD player.  (not Blu Ray)  Makes this a great office, small bedroom, college dorm, camping or recreational vehicle TV; basically a all-in-one arrangement.Can't comment on longevity yet, but TV doesn't run hot which is always a plus.  Remote is the typical confusing multi button.  But labels are readable and a little practice with the menus solves the confusion.  Manual is crap, sorry.For when you can't find remote, TV does have channel selection, volumne, menu/source and power button centered on top.  :-)Bottom line.. decent TV and good features for the discounted price.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture, great value", "Author": "Mike from Golden, CO", "ReviewID": "R4B5UR2NIAGVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV (as well as a 13\") for my motor home and the picture is great.

I installed it in an RV  in Dec and took my first trip in May and did not relaize when the air conditioner is on you can not hear the TV  Second problem was TV would shut off all by itself at any time and had to be restarted. Then some of the channels came in fuzzy with a lot of static and I am on cable. Needless to say that this all happened  on my trip in June just after warranty ran out. Less than 4 hours of use and the tv crapped out. I paid the labor to have it repaired and got it back with the same volume problem and NAXA told me that that is all louder it will go the speakers are small go out and buy speakers to put on it so you can hear the TV. Paid $200.00 for TV, $65.00 to have it repaired  and now have to buy external speakers another $50.00..  I hould have bought a brand name TV. Bought a 15 inch RCA Panasonic for the RV bed room and the  volume is just fine smaller TV with better speakers  you can hear it from 25 ft away if you need to.

Has excellent features for the price, including built-in DVD player,USB, Includes DC \"cig plug\" connector, remote, AC transformer/cord.  Has all the connections one would need...HDMI, VGA, RF, etc.  Built in Plastic tipable stand (looks like 3 screws would remove it), ready for wall-mount (4 female threaded screw holes in back).  Good picture and reasonable sound.  Lots of adjustments available, including Base/treble, surround sound, and AGC (auto gain control).On the negative side: As expected, sound is tinny.  Volume level with DVD is VERY low (a lot of that is due to Hollywood...).  Figuring out how to insert and especially eject a DVD is a challenge, a function that is mentioned in the otherwise good Op Manual NOWHERE.Again, the DVD is also defecient in that it only runs at 480p.  All of this is tolerable for our use which will basically be for watching a DVD in our RV bed like a laptop.  I may also connect it through the RV's sound system and see if that improves things.One other con is it's firmware set-up.  It insists on running a channel scan even though it's hooked up to cable/satellite.  A user should be able to simply set it on channel 3 and go, but the set up forces one to wait a good 15 minutes to scan and...of course...only find channel 3.  A really stupid set-up function.This will work for our purposes but would never buy it for our home unless we were on a tight budget.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Would be 4 star but for poor quality control", "Author": "Phil Harmonic", "ReviewID": "R31ICZ05EOMAF9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The TV/DVD functions very well but the HDMI port 1,  USB,  and SD card ports do not.

Plugs right into the cigarette lighter / 12V outlet in my trailer and we get to watch TV in the woods! When I was a kid I always dreamed about watching TV in the woods and now I'm a grown man living the dream... All I need now is a Delorean and I'll be in 12 year old boy heaven. I've connected it to the trailer antenna via coax and it seems to get better reception than other TV's I've used in the past  - - - I went from getting 0 digital channels to 4 or 5 in my driveway. The DVD player is a nice touch and allows for entertainment when no channels are available - and the TV is still pretty slim and light despite the extra gear. I have noticed that the viewing angle on this TV is somewhat narrow...  I was sitting closer to the TV and had to look up at the screen and got the weird \"shadow people\" effect ... but this was corrected by tilting the TV downward a bit. It isn't surprising that the sound on this is terrible... like the speakers are made from kazoos ... but It's an easy fix - plug it into another audio device - I use the stereo system in the trailer but even a boom box would work.
