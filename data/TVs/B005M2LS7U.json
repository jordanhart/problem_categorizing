{"Reviews": [{"Title": "good price for a Sony", "Author": "Armando", "ReviewID": "RC5JP4Y2S7KT8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My mom bought a Sony Bravia 40\" LCD like 4 years ago for $1,100. Recently, i had to replace the TV in my room so since prices have gone down in the years, i can now afford to go bigger. I decided to move the 40\" Sony into my room and get a 55\" for the Living room.  My mom wanted another Sony Bravia cuz she liked the one she had before.  Originally i went to Frys for a different TV but stumbled upon this one for $799.  Seemed like a really good deal for a Sony. Besides, the other one i was gonna get was Plasma and i like LCD better cuz there's less glare. And since it was a Sony Bravia it worked out perfectlySet up was a 2 person job but pretty simple.  After i set it up i was looking for the power cable in the box and realized it was attached to the tv. It's not detachable so that may be an issue for others. Mine sits on a tv stand so it's all good. and there's a piece that was supposed to hide the screws but i didn't even bother putting it on cuz u can't tell.As for the TV Quality:I'm not sure if it's the size of the tv but the HD channels don't look as crisp as they did on the 40\".  I figured that might be the case since it has to stretch the image a bit more to fit the 55\".  So i connected my blu-ray player with HDMI and played some movies at 1080p. Looks much better than 1080i cable but not as good as the 40\".  I work as a Video Editor so I'm very picky with quality. However, my parents don't notice. Then again they can't tell Standard Definition from High Definition...The Motion flow is ok, it does improve the focus on moving images, though this doesn't concern me as much as image sharpness. The 40\" is 60 Hz so the 55\" takes the win.The contrast ratio is good. This was the major problem i had with past TVs. When playing dark games or watching dark movies, much of the detail was lost.  finding middle ground left everything hazy. Both Sonys have good blacks, whites, and colors.The sound is ok, not as good as the 40\" but i won't get into much of that. I rely on my 5.1 surround sound for that. If you're looking for audio quality, invest in a 5.1 surround sound with OPTICAL input.As for the design:Cons: The frame is glossy and kinda big. Also the power cable is not detachable, i can imagine this being problematic for some.Pros: LCD display has almost no glare in my living room where there are lots of windows.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. It was a good deal for the brand and size. i wouldn't pay more than $800 for this tv considering I've seen 60\" LCDs for $900.  The quality is good for the size. Don't mean to sound like a snob but the average viewer can't tell 720p from 1080p anyway.A few tips for those new to High Definition Home Theaters:Plasma has nice color, but lots of glare so they are best for dark rooms.LCD has less glare.LED has low glare and nice blacks.HD cable only broadcasts at 1080i so don't worry about getting 1080p unless you have a Blu-ray player.WIFI READY DOES NOT MEAN BUILT-IN WIFI. You have to buy an adapter for WiFi ready TVs.If you want 1080p use HDMIIf you want true 5.1 surround, invest in one with OPTICAL input.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "A warranty replacement from a Samsung too expensive to fix", "Author": "EngrPaul \"EngrPaul\"", "ReviewID": "RKZLVHG8M5ZKQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this TV new, but as a replacement from my extended warranty company.  I had a 52\" Samsung LCD that was too expensive to fix.While the picture quality is as-good-as, I had to supplement the TV with a soundbar/subwoofer HT-CT150 combo to achieve sufficient sound quality and volume.Only 2x10W speakers is a joke for a LCD TV where there is plenty of space for big speakers and amplifier components.  I can understand how slim LED TV's having underpowered audio due to size limitations.  I guess LCD's are a dying breed and they give them the same lame audio drivers until they completely go away.== Pros ==55\" Screen.Great picture quality.Handsome appearance.Bravia works good with other Sony components.Wide mode enables viewing 4:3 input signals full-screen with less stretching.Input/output including PC, component, and digital optical audio.USB for pictures, video, music, thought limited formats.Packaged really well and easy to setup.Easy menus.== Cons ==Horribly weak sound.Anti-reflective screen SPREADS light reflections and actually makes it HARDER to view the picture.Wobbly stand: Set acts like a pendulum side-to-side if bumped.No Audio Return Channel (Doesn't send audio via HDMI to a theater system).Only 2 HDMI inputs, no S-Video input.No backlighting on the remote controlSlow to startup when turned on.TV cannot change HDMI inputs on the Sony Theater system, despite both being Bravia and syncing correctly.Thin owner's manual.For the way I use a TV, I am satisfied with my warranty replacement TV.  Based on my multiple bad experiences with Samsung, I am extremely glad to have a Sony-branded product.If I was purchasing a TV for myself, I would NOT go with the traditional LCD with CCFL (fluorescent) backlighting, I would definitely spring for LED backlighting.  I would need to buy an external audio system either way.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "pleased so far", "Author": "Amazon_1973", "ReviewID": "R12YVNGQPOFG7U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this for under 1k through Amazon and it arrived 4 days later. Setup was painless. Tv comes with 2 hdmi inputs and 1 set of AV jacks, enough to suit our needs.Speakers are mounted on the underside offering somewhat better sound than our rear speaker 46\". The picture and controls were easily adjusted and simple to understand.The only issue we have found so far is the headers during searches suggest this unit was wi-fi ready but that is not the case, THIS TV IS NOT WIFI READY. We are using a wifi bluray so this is not a huge issue overall. The other confusing part is the 120 mh motionflow which I understood to be an enhanced 120 but it appears to be an enhanced 60mh , we are still trying to confirm this but I will say whatever it is is good enough for our eyes.We watched transformers 1 and 2 and the picture was fantastic with no studders or blurring.For the low cost and large size we don't feel we could have done better for an everyday viewer, and the Sony picture blows the samsung picture relatives have out of the water.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV for the price", "Author": "sternn77", "ReviewID": "R1DSE4V13VA2P8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great TV.

Clearly this is a great panel! Although the default settings were absolutely terrible.If you can get this TV calibrated and you don't care about using it for anything except a glorified monitor, you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful", "Author": "O.

With this one, you don't really need additional audio system. It seems discontinued model. Not much left in the store.

Games, TV, HDTV, Blu-ray everything I have thrown at it, it handles.  The black levels are actually black - no bleeding from the edges as you get from an LED.

It simply stopped working last Thursday evening.I have done some simple troubleshooting to try to determine if there were any external causation...I.e.:  Electrical outlet having no power...however, using other outlets proved that theory incorrect. I also checked the outlet that had been used for power...it was good.  Circuit Breakers good to go.One thing.  I noticed a peculiar clicking sound from the Sony Bravia when I was disconnecting the plug from the electrical outlet.  Once I verified good power in that outlet...I reconnected the plug.  The clicking sounds manifested again.  When I gently moved the plug around in the outlet...there were multiple clicking sounds.Obviously there is an electrical relay attempting to engage within the Sony Bravia...but is not latching...there is still no power in the unit...I am guessing that the power supply...or a fuse located in it's vicinity are blown and/or faulty.Really???  This is a Sony product...I have had more than a few Sony TV's of the old CRT type, over the last 40+ Years, that last more than 20 years...and were still working when I gave them away...so what the heck is going on here?  I loved the Trinitron.I discovered that This Sony Bravia is made in Mexico...not Japan...  What can I do?  If this is the power supply...why isn't the unit built with an access panel for that and the potential Fuse???This Sony Bravia HAS already cost my family around $900 for the initial purchase...I do Not have the cash on hand to buy another and/or repair it...I suspect the simple repair Cost would be PROHIBITIVE.This unit has not been moved since initial installation in my Living Room.

I know most of you could care less about picture in picture, you have never set it up or used it on any TV, so you probably don't care.  I went out looking for a specific Vizio model that had PIP.  Found this at Wallmart for a fantastic price, under $900.  The Sony site says it has picture in picture and implies side by side pictures.  But that is a lie.  It has no side by side at all, and only supports PIP if one of the inputs is a PC.It appears as though it is being phased out, so there are great prices out there.ProsGreat picture quality.

Why? Motion blur! I never once had any problem on my 60 hz samsung but this 120 hz sony has given me blur problems from day one. I first noticed it when I popped in zombieland on blue ray. The scene where they are dropping stuff in the indian shop blurred when a vase hit the floor. I rewinded it to make sure I saw what I thought I saw and it happened again. That was the main thing I noticed on that movie, any others were minor enough that they didn't stick out. Then I watched a movie on showtime on demand in standard def and I turned it off becuase it was so bad. Everytime the movie panned forward like a camera panning around a room in a fluid motion the top and bottum of the tv like the where it would be black on wide screen was blurry. I wouldn't call this particularly fast motions but I started noticing it more as everytime the scene or even commercial panned vertically or horizontally it did this. I was annoyed that this tv only had two hdmi inputs but for the price I was going to deal with it. I wasn't enamored with dark scenes as they lost detail. I was a little curious about how while a very clear picture it was kind of odd how some things looked. But I cannot deal with this motion blur.

I have \"unplugged\" from cable and satellite and use Nextflix and Hulu Plus as a cheaper alternative to the exhorbitant fees associated with the big providers.I have a 46\" Sony Bravia that includes internet connectivity and a menu screen that offers the afformentioned streaming programs and it is EXCELLENT!
