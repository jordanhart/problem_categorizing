This one had a few good things going for it, most important the price which was very good.  I will admit I am spoiled as my primary TV is a Samsung 1080p, which is awesome.Downsides: The picture on this TV is not perfect guess that is due to the 720p resolution. It is fine for the bedroom or secondary TV but I would not suggest for a main TV if you love to watch crisp and clear picture. Also this TV only contains 2 HDMI outputs just so you know one cable box and one Blue ray and that is it.Would recommend TV due to price point and Magnavox name.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, got it for my birthday", "Author": "Daniel Lafollette", "ReviewID": "RPPNHYU8TFQQ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was given this TV as a birthday present.

That is why so many of these just die out of nowhere.  The faulty capacitors are made by a company called capxon.

If you know how to solder it is an easy and cheap fix to replace the bad caps.  About $5 in parts about 5 minutes worth of soldering and maybe 30 minutes more to take the TV apart and put it back together.

It was a good price and I actually think the picture is better than the Sharp...I use an antenna and it's been fine.  The Sharp was just over four years old and I was mad that it happened right after the extended warranty ran out.  Now I'm worried because the descriptions in the bad reviews sound exactly like what happened to my other TV, but sooner.  I've only had this one for three months and haven't had any problems with it.  The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is that the remote doesn't have as many features as the Sharp (I was spoiled), plus there is a tiny delay when I change channels.  Otherwise, I like it just fine for now and will cross my fingers that it lasts longer than it did for other people.  I have it hooked up to rabbit ears through a DVD/VCR player/recorder in the HDMI slot and the picture really is okay.Is the fade to black issue something that happens to HDTVs in general?  I find is strange that the same thing happened to two different brands at two different price points.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Won't Turn Back On", "Author": "P Stephen Devereaux", "ReviewID": "R2SU4PKJ0CNAW5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I tried to plug it into surge protect, now it won't turn on.

While everything works when zone 2 of the receiver is set to use the audio/video feeds from the Wii, when zone 2 is set to shoutcast that's built into the receiver I was unable to hear anything. After experimenting with the zone set to the Wii, I discovered if there's no video signal in to the TV via the RCA connections, the audio input is ignored/muted. This is a huge pain in the butt for me and don't have a clue why the TV is setup to do this. So now to get the setup to work as I want, I have to move our Sony TV that's currently in our bedroom into his room and use this TV in our bedroom.Had I known the TV behaved his way, I would have opted for a different unit.
