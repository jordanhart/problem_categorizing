It doesn't get the reception I was hoping for, but I guess I have to get a stronger antenna.  It is a cute set, though. I am looking forward to using the dvd feature soon.  I think it's awesome that it has the dvd feature on such a small set.  It will be awesome to use to do exercise videos with it.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazon perfect 10, GizmGrab 0!", "Author": "Cassandra", "ReviewID": "R16ZH3XPK23SS4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I originally ordered this tv for my young daughter because it was perfect size and a combo deal with the built in DVD player. No problems with Amazon itself, however the original seller of this device,GIZMOGRAB screwed it up. Not only did i pay for the faster delivery and was given the expectations of 2 day shipping but instead needed to be refunded because I didnt receive it for 2 weeks almost(Mind you, I ordered it at the beginning of the week,so two business day would have brought me to thurs-fri) but they then sent me the wrong tv! I l've amazon, but I'm NEVER ordering from GIZMOGRAB AGAIN", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "TV Type: LED/DVD\nScreen Size Class: 19\"\nVertical Resolution: 720p\nMaximum Resolution: 1366 x 768\nScreen Refresh Rate: 60Hz", "Name": "Ematic 19\" LED 720p 60Hz HDTV/DVD | ETD209", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WmfnZmgeL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BLBFX0Y"}}
