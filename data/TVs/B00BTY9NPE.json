{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Gorgeous tv", "Author": "sjones", "ReviewID": "R3BYNXEMS1IOFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is a beauty to look at. You can tell it is built with greater quality and better materials than other 32 inch televisions, as well as other tvs in this price range. The bezel is small, and made of metal. It forms a nice border for the screen.  There is only the faint BRAVIA lettering on the left top corner. There is an energy star label in the lower right corner which can be peeled off. A small silver module at the front has the SONY logo with led lighting. It is a very minimalistic and modern looking television from the front view. At the back of the television it is thin from the top (only 0.5 inches thick), but at the bottom where the power unit and other electronic components are located it has a depth of 2.5 inches. The thin stainless steel is beautiful as it is functional. The tv sits rock solid and feels very secure. The stand has a foot print of 8 inches deep by 16 inches wide.So the main question is how is the picture quality? Well I am pleased to say that the picture quality is excellent! Blacks look truly black. THe color palette is pleasant and have a nice pop. The picture look more realistic compared to a 32 inch Samsung I demoed in store. The Samsung appeared over-saturated and images appear burnt out. THe Sony did a better job of showing a more even, realistic, and detailed image.I do not know if this is an IPS screen. Even if it wasn't the viewing angles are quite good. I had no issues with sitting off centre. Contrast and brightness are slightly decreased, but still fine. I was happy to note there was no brightness variations across the screen. The lighting is very even on my unit. The screen is somewhere between matte and gloss, so while glare is there it is not disturbing. Further because it is not as matte, as my previous Samsung monitor, the picture appears vibrant.The remote is nice to hold. It has a good feel, and the layout is nicely thought out. There are shortcut buttons to Netflix, the Sony Entertainment Network (SEN) hub, and Home. I would have liked it to have backlighting. I also wished it had a touch panel too.The Smart features are nice. Like I said already, this tv can connect to Netflix, and SEN. In the SEN screen you have an app for Youtube, NHL Game Center, Crackle, Picassa, etc to name a few. I noticed it was missing HULU which would have been nice to include. Connection to my wireless network was simple and quick. Accessing the apps were slighly sluggish at times. I had to wait for them to load, and some may find the few seconds frustrating. Generally browsing the apps was not such a painless endeavour, but neither is it too painful. I wished the speed was better. The tv has an internet browser. The problem is with trying to navigate web pages. Because it's all from the basic remote, and not a touch pad, it slows what is an easy task performed on a tablet or on a computer. You can connect to the tv with your tablet or smartphone to help with navigation in the Youtube app which makes searching or browsing for videos a whole lot faster.There are only two HDMI ports, and one USB port which is limiting. To connect to your stereo system you would need to use an optical digital audio cable. Or you can use a 3.5mm plug to RCA cable. There are no standard RCA outputs. The sound quality of the tv speaker is not bad. I just prefer to connect it to my Energy speakers, which sounds much better.I haven't tried much gaming with this tv. The motion is fine as far as I can tell. Didn't notice much issue with lag.There are lots of customizations for picture. There are several scene modes. You can also customize picture quality to the way you like with white balance, hues, saturation, brightness, and more. There are various picture enhancements in the menu which works well.The 32W650A is probably one of the best 32 inch television out there, although there is a small list to chose from. Most manufacturers are not interested in making 32 inch televisions these days, and instead focusing on larger tv displays. I heartily recommend it.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picture quality and detail the best I've seen on a TV but sound quality not as good as I was expecting", "Author": "Jackie Davis", "ReviewID": "R3P7LLBEP0E1K4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here's the basics on what you need to know about this TV. First the picture quality in HD is among the best based on personal experience and the reviews I've read online. I did research on this TV and bought it according to reviews from credible sources and not just customer reviews. In the picture quality department it exceeded way beyond my expectations but the sound quality is something left to be desired which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars. In the end I ended up buying a separate sound bar for better quality sound. One other drawback is the lack of inputs. There are only two hdmi inputs, one composite and one av. It also has an optical input, LAN for internet, one usb, one audio out and cable input. Menu interface is user friendly, easy to understand with the help of the tutorial and I have nothing negative to say about it. If picture quality is important to you you can't go wrong with this TV but lack of quality sound and inputs is what's holding back a perfect score for this TV.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 32-inch Available - Period!", "Author": "Jesse P", "ReviewID": "R3RNANZNER1N14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't go over what many have already stated on here, size - specs etc., what I'll cover is my personal experiences with this set, both pros and cons:KDL-32W650AThis review covers the use of this TV as a dedicated console and PC display only.  I did watch several Blu-rays and all of them were stellar on this set, better than any other I mention in the below comments, though my primary use was intended for gaming.Pros:- Stellar image quality - simply pristine, one of the best screen coatings I've seen (glossy, though little to no reflection, similar to Philips Moth Eye technology), definitely looks great. I compared this TV directly to several other units, using a variety of movies and games, both console and PC:LG: 32CS560, 32LN5700, 32LN530B (32LN530B is without question, the best 720p TV I've used).Samsung: UN40F6300 (TS01 and TU02) and the UN32F5500 (TS01)(literally no comparison, TU02 is exceptional in every regard), TS01 had a lot of back light bleeding, flashlight spots and overall poor uniformity, TU02 had none of these issues.Vizio M series: Beautiful TVs, though higher input lag and not as many options to tweak image settings.- Sony looked better than all of them except maybe the UN40F6300 TU02, real toss-up between the two - it comes down to a preference thing. Sony is slightly more muted, though realistic looking colors, they are not over saturated.  That said, the colors on the Samsung weren't either, though they have more of a pop to them, some will like this others will prefer the more muted/pastel look of the Sony.- Input lag - Sony all the way, every setting on the Sony has great input lag - sub 30ms, Samsung and LG both in game mode are in the 30's, LG higher 40's and that's in game mode.  Sony trumps everyone in this regard.  Samsung and LG are over 100ms using anything other than game mode.- Style and look, Sony - looks like a higher quality piece of equipment, feels like it as well, seems like a tank compared to the other models.- Sony Scene select is exceptional, about 10-12 individual calibration settings you can use with the click of one button, think game settings, movie mode, PC etc., Sony did an excellent job on this aspect.- X-Reality Pro on Sony is great, brings games to life - exceptional clarity and clean looking images.- Sony had no issues as far as back light bleeding, clouding or flash lighting, this is an area that two of three Samsung's I tried had issues, the LG's and Vizio were all pretty good in this regard.- Minimal blurring, better than all of the other sets. Samsung's PC mode is exceptional, literally no discernable blurring, though it lacks the color and clarity of the other modes.Cons:- Cost, simply too much money for a 32-inch TV in my opinion.- Only two HDMIs, especially given the cost and Sony's competition offering 3-4 on average.- Sound was not as good as I expected. All of the LG's had better sound than the other TV's I compared them to, LG's clear voice technology is outstanding.- Odd mounting procedures needed as others detailed, need to use supplied mount kit for VESA and other configurations, not a huge deal, though it's odd Sony took the approach they did.- The stand sets somewhat low compared to other configurations offered by competitors. I had to prop my KDL-32W650A on a platform so my Sony Sound Bar didn't obscure the screen.- Smart TV is on par with LG, though nowhere near as good as Samsung and Vizio - I would give Samsung the nod overall.- Only one USB port.- LED Motion Mode - laughable at best compared to the other sets, way too dark and has a strong flicker to it. Poorest implementation I've seen, literally useless in all but the most extreme circumstances.If you are absolutely set on getting a 32-inch with the best image quality, minimal image blurring and lowest input lag, look no further. However, I've decided to go with the UN40F6300 - Panel TU02, my reasoning: I was miffed at the overall price of the Sony, only two HDMIs and I thought Samsung was offering much more for my money, eight inches in diagonal size, more connectivity options, better interface and extremely similar in terms of image quality all for $50 less than the KDL-32W650A. I also wasn't planning to use it as a dedicated PC monitor. I played over 20 PC and console games in a side by side comparison and found the 40-inch was more what I was looking for ( I was sitting a approximately 5-7 feet away, mostly using a game pad). I don't think most would be happy to use the Sony as a desktop PC monitor, it's not bad in this regard, though up too close and you can start to see the pixel structure, compared to a smaller dot pitch on a dedicated LED PC monitor. I did use it as a dedicated PC gaming monitor for a few days, though couldn't get past the pixelization up close. Skyrim, L4D2 and many other games looked immaculate, it was games such as Age of Empires 3, Rome 2, Starcraft II and other mouse directed RTS and strategy games that looked pixelated up close. In closing, I'm fond of what Sony did with this set, though if the price was a bit more reasonable and it had more than two HDMIs, it would be a much more recommended and viable option for many, including myself.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture, but......", "Author": "Larry", "ReviewID": "R20EPJGPYR3QQ8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture is great and Sony has done a nice job with the menu, setup, etc., but there is one major drawback to be aware of.  This TV is NOT VESA compliant in terms of TV mounting.  You can NOT use a standard VESA TV mount.  The TV comes with a special mount that can be used to mount the TV flat against the wall using the supplied hardware, but it is impossible to use any full-motion, or any other VESA compliant mounts available anywhere.  I spoke to Sony support, and they confirmed that I am correct. So, if you are planning to mount your TV using a motion or angled wall mount, do not purchase this TV.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great as a Computer Monitor & for PC gaming, but some adjustments required.

Again, this TV has no discernible PWM flicker, unless you turn on Led Motion Mode, not a very useful feature anyway since it dims the picture too much.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Tip for this and most Sony sets...", "Author": "DaveC19", "ReviewID": "R2EWPQSGBZEIUN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I won't go into details of this set as others have covered it. I do own this TV.  HOWEVER I do have an important TIP for anyone using this TV (and most Sony sets).  To get the sharpest picture and see the WHOLE image go into settings and set screen mode to \"FULL PIXEL\".  This is especially important for gaming.  All other modes SCALE and CROP your image!  Scaling can invoke a filter which will cause the image to be slightly fuzzy, and of course you lose some of your picture with the cropping.  So if you are inputting a 1080P signal the default setting will zoom in slightly and crop your picture!  Why they think a fuzzier image and loss of a decent portion of your picture is good is beyond me.  The \"FULL PIXEL\" setting, however,will give you a 1:1 pixel mapped picture on 1080P material giving you the full picture and sharpness.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unusually high quality, TVs like this are rare", "Author": "Home Theater Enthusiast", "ReviewID": "R3P3EPIK4LIMJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had thought they had stopped making TVs of this quality in this size range years ago. This TV easily surpasses Samsung's series 9 line, and is really the best looking screen I have owned in the past decade.Some other things I really like about this TV is the durable metal frame, a clear sign of quality. This TV also uniquely has an external power brick, which is actually a blessing because I have had 2 Samsung TVs deteriorate and die because of internal power supplies, which really only serve to produce heat inside the set. Because of this TVs external power brick, this Sony TV is cool running and gets mildly lukewarm at most, which should surely increase it's overall life.Also, even though this TV is advertised as just 60hz, it still has the smooth LED motion tech built in giving it the appearance of 120hz.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice TV Purchased for my bedroom :)", "Author": "Yogesh Joshi", "ReviewID": "R1IRJO1CZFU91N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice TV set.

My previous HDTV was a 22\" Insignia, which was quite adequate, if not more so.  Trouble is, after three or four years, the screen wouldn't light up after powering it on.  So looked at many HDTVs and ended up buying a Samsung 26\" (I forget the model number).  But I never could get a decent picture, even though I know my way around the settings.After reading many reviews on the Sony KDL-32W650A, I took the plunge and bought this product.  It was twice as expensive as its \"peers,\" but worth every penny.Quality always trumps mediocrity.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exceptional TV", "Author": "Nome de Plume", "ReviewID": "R1VRQYXVTY9BYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's address sound quality first since this has been a chronic problem with flat screen televisions. I didn't like the sound quality at all when I previewed the 32W650A in the store and decided external speakers would be a necessity. After almost two months of viewing and listening, I still haven't installed satellite speakers because the Sony sound is actually quite nice. I might upgrade at some point but when it comes to audio quality, there is no doubt the environment has a very large influence on what the listener hears. The boxy location in my old entertainment unit obviously works well and enhances the backward firing speakers. I was even surprised at the sound quality while setting up the television on the work bench in the basement. My guess is that most locations outside the less than ideal retail display area will provide at least decent sonic quality. By the way, check out Audio Engine self powered speakers as a complement to this television.The smaller screen size, great processor, and terrific color dynamics all contribute to create a spectacular visual experience with HD input. The antenna feed with either 720p or 1080i signals continue to impress with a picture that is solid as a 35mm photo (Do you remember those?). The 480i over the air signals are certainly acceptable but I must confess that the standard definition signals delivered via Comcast suffered in comparison to being viewed on my old CRT televisions.Warning Will Robinson! If you subscribe only to standard (low definition) cable, keep your CRT television! Even HD cable broadcasts don't look as good as the antenna feed. To take advantage of this great TV I highly recommend using an antenna for the stations available in your area and then supplementing with cable stations into one of the two HDMI ports or the RCA inputs.Even though I thought the factory settings looked good, I used an IOS app called: \"THX Tune-Up\" to fine tune this set. It requires a $40 cable but was fun and easy using my wife's I-phone. Here's the URL to learn more:[...]The bottom line is I am delighted with this purchase.

I've had 10's of tv's over the past 4 years. Also PC monitors including the latest Asus 9ms input lag one.Every other TV or Monitor I've had either had horrible backlight bleed, or IPS glow which is a pain to view for movies. Every Samsung TV I've had all produced significant amounts of ghosting which is unbearable. I've had a few of them too, including the 32\" 5500 series. The LG LM6200 I had was the last one I just had before it broke.Now with that LG gone. It was time to focus on what I wanted in a TV. Deep, deep black levels similar to a plasma. Neutral colors, nothing over saturated. No IPS glow, so IPS was out of question, a 32\" as I would be using it as a PC monitor/ Gaming Console/ Movie watching.This Sony W650 is Incredible. It has less input lag than the LG IPS it replaced IMO. Now, IPS is known for low input lag, but this Sony VA panel definitely feels less laggy. Not only that, but the black levels are far better. The brightness is great as well. So great that I have it turned down all the way to 0 on the backlight. I'm in a completely dark room though, with just one light bulb. I was hoping to find a TV with a glass/ glossy screen with no Anti Glare coating. This TV does however uses a AG coating, but it's semi glossy. Similar to the LG. With that being said, web text is clear. I believe this tv is Chroma? 4:4:4 subsampling. Meaning, red text on a black background doesn't blur or have problems viewing. Colors are very neutral too. The tv sits pretty low too, so great as a PC monitor.Now, a little bit about the Smart features. It has A LOT! Vimeo, Amazon, and many more which I didn't really bother to remember. If you have a question about one, leave a comment and I'll let you know if it's available on the tv.The Optical out, does provide Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. I don't know what the speakers on the TV sound like as I use my Home Theater speakers so I can't comment on those, nor the USB/movie function. The Bezel is very minimal. About half and inch wide across the top and sides.The bottom bezel is about 1 inch. The majority of the top half of the TV is very slim, just as slim as the bezel. The bottom half is where it gets bulky in the back so make sure the location for this tv will have room.Now onto what I don't like about the TV.The Stand. It doesn't swivel, or tilt. It's just there holding the tv up. So when I get out of my desk to lay in bed, I can't just swivel the tv to point at my location. I have to turn the entire stand too, to where it needs to point at. Thus causing me to move my keyboard, mouse out into the middle of the desk. Just a small issue, but that's just my dislike. The tv has color shifting or so when I am viewing it from a standing position. It's not bad, but noticeable. The remote sensor is down at the bottom near the Sony logo. I put my keyboard on the tv stand to give a degree of angle to type a bit more comfortable. Sometimes I forget to move it back when I go to bed and then can't use the remote as the keyboard ends up blocking the sensor.All in all. This is hands down the best tv so far that I bought that fits all my needs. Gaming, and watching movies with an outstanding picture. Minimal input lag, very minimal ghosting/glare compared to the Samsung tv's. BUT not as perfect as TN/IPS/Plasma glare which isn't noticeable on those three imo. I hope this review helped a bit in your decision.If you have any questions, just comment back on this review and I'll try my best to help.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Best", "Author": "Alvin F.

Moreover, some movie applications, such as www.watch32 (hardly functional access through Sony)  and Amazon Prime Movies show icon-thumbnails which are so small that they are unreadable on the 32 inch screen. In this regard  I have a Roku on which all icons come through at a readable size with far fewer icons on the same screen. So my assumption is that the problem may be Sony factory programming which does not vary according to screen size. In any event, I have gone through three levels of not-helpful technical support that may be in  India. One of the technical support people said of the small pictures; \"This is how it is supposed to be\"  and explained that my difficulty is \"because the screen is too small.\" He also told me that Sony considers the internet connection to be \u201cmerely incidental.\u201d  Too bad, This is a great picture but I could not recommend the set to any of my friends.For another opinion see this review: [...]", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "DLNA media player will not play large video files", "Author": "danT", "ReviewID": "R2HN8X1FWKM5E4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good picture, sound OK, remote cannot control other devices.
