{"Reviews": [{"Title": "EXCELLENT PURCHASE!!!", "Author": "zuma", "ReviewID": "R2RH5C1O5O1IVI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, this review is based on the TV, price paid, and features it has, i.e. \"value for the money\". That said, this is a great TV with a good picture (but I have not done a side-by-side comparison with other HDTVs). Games play fine, not sure why others had problems...maybe they did not do the set-up correctly. TV does have a \"Game\" mode which is supposed to help any lag one might experience, and under advanced picture mode, you can set the \"Smooth Motion Effect\" to various levels. One of the main reasons I purchased this TV was that Vizio is one of the few manufacturers that list the power usage of their TVs without having to do a lot of searching, which was important to me. I have owned this TV for about a week.I noticed some reviews say this TV has poor side views.  I do not see that at all, in fact i have never owned a LCD TV that has NO decrease in picture quality when viewed from the side until this one.  The TV is advertized with a 178 degree viewing angle and i would say that is true...this TV has a GREAT side viewing ablity.Side note: Too bad one of the first reviews gave this TV a bad rating based on perceived lag which is not true. But first reviews always get the most votes because they are automatically put at the top, which is a catch twenty-two, because that tends to keep them at the top (people vote most for the first few reviews they see, thereby keeping them on top).PROS:PriceGreat valueEasy setupLight weight (this thing only weighs 67 pounds, but TV is about 5\" thick)Picture quality...very nice picture (but did not check out 1080P)Energy Star 4...uses only 138 watts (THIS IS A BIG ONE, will save you a lot of money!) Edit 12/19/2010-see below.CONS (minimal):Sound is not the best, but still pretty goodNo direct hookup to online media (i.e. Netflix, etc.) (but of course I knew this, I just use my DVD player)Style is good, not great (but still much BETTER than the original Vizios)Minimal connections, 3 HDMI, and only 1 composite & AV, really s/b two eachNo side connections-(except for 1 HDMI & USB) worst con in my opinionPoor onboard TV controls (without remote) ...but I guess this is normal nowadaysAnd this is not part of the overall rating, but the Amazon TV information (specs), purchase, checkout, truck delivery time (to inside house) and setup was top-notch, I knew when the TV would be delivered (2 hour time frame) at time of purchase! No problems!! I would definitely buy this TV again.Edit: 12/19/2010I tried the video games Quake 4, Serious Sam and Super Mario World, still cannot perceive a lag. I am no game expert, but I have not found any problem.Also hooked up a \"Kill A Watt\" to check power usage, watts used when off = 0...Good! Watts used when on and using zoom (full screen) ranged from 160 to 200 with the average in between (mostly 170 to 180)...Not so Good! This is higher than I hoped but still good for such a large TV. But I wonder how they got the advertised 138 watts?Edit: 1/23/2011Per the site: [...] this TV is rated at 152 watts. The maximum wattage an energy star 4.1 TV of this size can use to qualify is 178 watts.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Turn of Smooth Motion!", "Author": "Rod", "ReviewID": "R17TDVL6R4LJ17", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good, low priced TV, no frills but a good basic big TV.  The problems the other reviews talk about, with video lag and processing that takes away the film-look bothered me right away as well, and give the images a very weird effect.  I thought maybe it was just me, or I wasn't used to a good quality picture, but whatever it was was not good.  I really noticed it with fast motion sports, a football in the air was jittery and choppy.  But there is a solution - on the second page of the TV Picture setting (select \"more\" at the bottom of the first Picture screen) there is a setting called Smooth Motion.  Turn it off, and turn the Smooth Motion DEMO off.  Problem solved, no more lag, jitters, and the film grain is back in the image.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Everyone loves our TV, including me", "Author": "David Spicher", "ReviewID": "R1VX3FE9BDDEU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this from a different retailer for 1399 around Jan 2010. It looks amazing in hi def with broadcasts like Glee, Marriage Ref, or regular DVDs.Counter to the other reviews, The playstation looks awesome too, Full 1080P. I haven't noticed unplayable issues of lag, & I game online all the time. There was lag when I went through my receiver first via HDMI enough to notice in guitar hero or rock band, so I plug in directly ps3 to TV now for video because of that. I can't help but wonder if that kid knew how to hook up his game console. Hint: if it isn't with an HDMI cable, then you aren't seeing HiDef 1080 correctly. We've had nothing but jaw dropping fan reviews from our picture, people always want to come back and play/watch some more.Vizios also have ability to turn off speakers and have more adjustments to audio, this is good, as I rarely use the TVs speakers. Had a friend tell me his new Sony wouldn't let him do that.Cons: this TV can see through green screens... making fake shots look even more fake. I've tried to adjust it myself, but came back to default settings which looked better than mine. It brightens movies, losing that film effect, making movies look more like soap operas or camcorder shots. I suspect 'backlight' to be the cause of this, but again, I was never happy with my adjustments to make it better. another thing, when the screen is really bright, and I can see a fault in the 'plastic film' near part of the screen, a fold. I'd have to point it out to you it's so minor and you wouldn't see it 99 percent of the time, but it was a fault in my particular tv.My panasonic Viera picture is slightly better & less bright, but I would make this purchase again over & over.(especially at the new price!)", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great, No Frills Big TV", "Author": "J. Jordan", "ReviewID": "R154TDZABKPNTF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wasn't TV shopping when Amazon last had this TV on Cyber Monday for $899.  When I started shopping, it was up to $988, which was still good, but I didn't pull the trigger. I ended up buying locally at CompUSA/Tiger Direct during a 2-day sale for $899.  So even with tax, I was happy to be able to bring it home immediately and avoid the possibility of delivery issues other reviewers have mentioned.About the picture: Right out the box, with the factory settings, the picture is crisp and very nice!  Looked better than it did in the store!  Set up was VERY easy.  Take it out, set up to the cable box, pull off plastic, turn it on, watch TV.  Took just a few minutes.  Now that I've had it a few days, I've experimented with all the settings other have mentioned.  There are enough picture options for standard viewing, movies, different sports, and games that everyone will find something useful.  Picture will be a matter of taste, so use other reviewer's suggestions to narrow down on settings to your liking. I still have to swap out my current cable box for HDTV programming, so I can only imagine how good it will look if regular programming looks this good!As far as limited inputs, that is true, but all I needed was a good looking big flat panel TV.  I plan only to add a blu ray and Wii, so this TV more than fits my needs.  I compared plasma, LCD, LED, and looked at TVs with internet applications.  If you plan to add a lot of equipment and want all those internet applications, you may need to go with something with more HDMI input. I decided against plasma because I found dwindling availability. It seems LCD/LED is the way to go.  I went LCD over LED for cost, and I prefer the less glossy picture that it offers over plasma.  This TV replaced a big (but nice) 200lb HDTV rear projection, which costs me $2000 6 years ago and is worth just pennies today.  At that time, plasma and DLP started at $4000.  Very few DLP being sold, and similarly sized plasma can now be had for $700, so I'm glad I didn't spend $4000 back then!  I didn't break the bank to go LCD, and saved quite a bit over a similarly sized LED.It's big, it's nice looking, it has a crisp picture, and it's not a heavy monster. This TV will fit most people's needs.  But whatever you decide, don't overbuy.  Don't spend hundreds for features you will not use. Prices continue to come down as technology evolves.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Nice TV", "Author": "tahadda", "ReviewID": "R1O95XPJP6O84G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Please dont let any negative reviews bother you on this tv. I was shaky at first too, but if you look long enough everything has a bad review. If you want a great tv, without all the extras you dont need, then get this, you wont be dissapointed. I have an xbox, bluray, and directtv hooked into my surround sound reciever with hdmi's and everything looks and sounds awesome.

There are some better tvs out there but you would have to spend hundreds more. Plus, its not like you will ever have 2 large Tvs side by side. My buddy brought over his high dollar sony bravia (for system link gaming party), and you could tell maybe a slight difference in picture side by side. But not enough of a difference to justify the hundreds extra he spent! I also do a lot a gaming and I havent noticed any lagging issues, I play plenty of high speed games such as Modern 2, Black Ops, Dantes Inferno ect with no problems. Good bright clear picture and quick response. I have read some others complaints about some lagging issue but I hardly beleive its the television, maybe more user error.

It is our first HDTV and first flat screen so maybw I'm happy because it's so much better than what we had before. We have not played any video games on it yet but we have played DVD's through a Playstation 3 and through a regular DVD player.This screen is huge and the picture is very nice. We mounted it above our fireplace on a tilt and swivel mount so we are able to turn the TV in any direction but I have found that you can view this TV very well at many angles anyway.We paid $899 for it on Amazon and it included free shipping which was wonderful. The delivery men set it up and made sure it worked before they left.Since we bought this, we have also purchased a smaller Vizio from Walmart on Black Friday and we love it too.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great except for one issue", "Author": "Evan Eberhardt", "ReviewID": "R1GQ9HCYJ60BAL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I knew the picture on this set would be awesome.  And it is.  I have a 42\" Vizio that is a couple years older that looks very similar in construction and it has had an outstanding picture.  The HD picture of this TV is excellent and easily equals any other brand.  Plus, the color reproduction bests other brands (such as LG and Sony), or at least to me it does.  Vizios are no joke picture wise, so do not be fooled by the price.  They routinely rank among the best by Consumer Reports and CNET for picture.  The SD picture is also very good and as good if not better than most other brands.Where Vizio falls behind is with the design of the set as the aesthetics are not exactly art worthy (and this set is nearly 5\" thick, whereas current LED sets are getting ridiculously thin). If looks are not a big deal for you though, Vizio is hard to beat for the price (in fact, they can't be beat from my experience).  This set also has no online apps of any kind, so keep that in mind.  I have a Home Theater PC and an Xbox 360 so I do all my online and Netflix stuff that route.  Also, there are only 3 HDMI inputs, so be aware of how many you may need (unless you plug all your stuff into a receiver and then just feed one plug to the Vizio like I do).The 120hz seems to work okay, but I do not like it (never have on any set) and leave it off for all viewing (I like some blur because it seems natural).  The sound is also probably the best you will find on a flat panel TV (probably because the set is somewhat thick, Vizio can put decent speakers in).  The sound is by no means like a real 5.1 setup (my Klipsch HDT 500 speaker set driven by an Onkyo TX-SR508 is vastly superior of course), but for news and sitcoms it is plenty adequate.  Vizio claims an average wattage of ~150 watts for this set.  I have no way of checking this, but if this is true then that is another plus and it actually keeps it in the same power range as some newer LED sets.The only issue I have had is with some mura effect or 'clouding' in the bottom left corner of the picture.  If I use the dynamic contrast setting, it is minimized but still apparent during dark scenes.  This bothered me, so I called Vizio and it sounded like they were going to swap the set out after the first call.  Nice!  However, after emailing pictures two separate times to Vizio tech support, they decided the issue was 'normal' (to quote them exactly).  I am not entirely sure of this though.  Many LCDs will have some clouding, but usually it is so faint that unless you are really looking for it, you won't notice it.  In this case however, it is fairly easy to see during a dark scene.  So, I am a little peeved at Vizio for at first displaying awesome service, but then deciding to not help me out.  I was really tempted to return the set but it was actually fulfilled through TigerDirect and they do not cover return shipping (it looks like amazon does apparently...doh!) and for this big TV and bigger box it would have cost over 200 bucks to ship back (it has to go back via a big truck and prices ranged from $209-380!).  Add that to the $50 shipping I paid on the way out and I would be out a quarter of the TV's cost.  So, I have decided I will just live with the issue and NEVER buy a big TV online again unless they have an awesome return policy like amazon does (a retail store like Costco is ideal here where you can return a TV to any of their stores for any reason, no return shipping headaches to deal with).  The good news is that the clouding has gotten a little better since the first day.  Perhaps it will continue to improve (fingers crossed).  So, after this experience I still recommend Vizio but I would advice purchasing through a retailer where returns will not be an issue.UPDATE:Well, I lucked out.  I found a little cluster of 6 pixels stuck in the red color right in the middle of the screen and much to my surprise I learned that Vizio (on certain models, this one included) has a zero bright pixel defect guarantee.  So, Vizio's customer service setup a TV swap and in a couple weeks the freight company arrived (Manna, they were okay) and unboxed a new set and took the other one away (well, the replacement set is a refurb actually, and has a a couple small dings in the frame, but who cares, its the screen I am looking at).  This set does not have any mura effect or clouding that I can see (or stuck pixels), just the same awesome picture minus the backlight issue. So, I am a happy camper once again.  Nice job Vizio.

It is an excellent product with an excellent price.  It showed up 2 days after I ordered it with no tax and no delivery charge.  On top of that, it was delivered by 2 friendly guys who brought it down into my basement and setup.  Not only did they do that, they also carried down a heavy TV stand that I purchased elsewhere.  The next best price I seen on this set was Sam's Club where I would have had to pay a little more, pay tax, pick it up and set it up my self.More on the television - I seen reviews on this set complaining about the quality.  In my opinion I don't know what their talking about; love the picture.  I'm sure if you spend $500-$1000 more you can get a better picture; but with the way technology changes so rapidly why would you want to do that?  Also you can spend more and get apps.  There again, with technology changing so rapidly I feel that would be a mistake also.  What I did is with the money I saved, I bought a blue ray player that has more options than any TV I seen on the market.  One downfall that I see is the connections in the back.  It's more than sufficient for my needs;  but if someone has a lot of components to hookup, I can see where it can be a problem.

I loved that one so much that when I finally convinced my wife that buying a 55\" TV for under $1000 was a requirement and not an option to watch the NFL playoffs I picked up this Vizio E550VL.My biggest and really only complaint about this TV is that the viewing angle is not very good.  If you look dead on, the TV is wonderful and vibrant.  Take a couple steps right or left and it gets white washed.  I know that LCD tvs will look worse the further right or left you get and no I am not looking at this thing directly from the side.  It almost makes it unwatchable especially if you are walking around in the room.  I've turned off smooth motion and all the other settings like I did for the 47 inch version of this guy.  No contrast, etc setting helps.  Had I spent more than $1000 for this TV and if inevitably in the future I would not be putting this TV in my bedroom years from now where looking at the TV from an angle would be minimized.  I do not see this same effect on the 47 inch version of this TV and in fact the colors really don't change on that one until you are almost looking at it from behind the TV.Minus this contrast issue when view from off center, the TV has a nice picture.  During fast motion sports like football, hockey, etc I see no pixelation like I've seen on other TVs.  I can stand about three feet away from it and the picture still looks good.  It obviously looks good from 10-15 feet which is where you would be sitting.Since I was so bothered by this white wash loss of colors I went to a big box store to see if this behavior occurs on all TVs or if it was just mine.  It turns out this happened on the display model at the big box store also.  Looking at other brand LCD that were 55\" I noticed some also had this issue and some did not (do not recall the brands).  What was really shocking to me is that the big box store (wally world) had the 2010 E550VL and the 2009 E550VL (it has a big ugly transparent panel at the bottom of the TV) right next to each other.  The 2009 E550VL has worse specs at least on contrast ratio, but DID NOT have this white wash issue when looking from the sides.  If you choose to look at this TV in person before you buy which I recommend note that this white wash is less pronounced in retail stores becasue they position the overhead lights and you first notices the glare from them than the issue with the colors.So while I see that Amazon now has this TV for under $1000 now so is the E470VL ( 47 inch in the same model family) which I also have and is wonderful.  I frankly would recommend that even though is smaller or wait until the LED TVs come down in price.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Crisp picture, but lag makes it worthless for video games.", "Author": "Kenny", "ReviewID": "R19MYPLHF149F1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I seriously can't even play Super Mario Bros 1 on this TV.

One day later than Amazon said but that's not the bad in my book.  Only reason this got a 4, is I had to call Ceva myself to schedule a delivery.  Trust me, do yourself a huge favor and call them when they get to your local hub it saves time and a headache.  I got a 12 to 4 slot.  So I stayed home expecting them to pull up at 3:30 or so.  Not so, they showed up at 12:05 and lugged it downstairs to my basement, (being careful the whole way.)  Got it out of the box and even helped hook up my dtv and put the batteries in the remote.  Overall very outstanding service.  Picture quality:  5/5  1080p never quite looked so good.  What can I say?  Rich vibrant colors, and razor sharp clarity.  The ambient lighting really adds to the experience as well.  I didn't think it'd be as nice as it was but it really accentuates the moods of the different scenes in a movie.  Lag time:  4/5  Don't get the wrong idea, this model doesn't lag during video games (at least for me.)  The only reason it's a 4, is that if you don't turn off smooth motion there is the tiniest (and I do mean tiny) not really lag.. but something was odd.  Not gamebreaking at all mind you so just remember to turn that off when playing games.  I believe it saves settings for the different inputs too, so do once and you're done.  Games play flawlessly now.  Connections:  4/5:  Eh I don't need 5 hdmi ports, but I can maybe see someone who does, but it does have a digital optical port which I love and use.  Not much to say.  3 hdmi, 1 composite, 1 component.. pretty basic.  Value for money:  5/5  Definitely worth at least $1600.  I got it for $1067.  Parents could not believe it.

We were able to connect our Comcast Cable/DVR, DVD and Wii to it with no issues and enjoyed good picture and good sound on the TV.  The TV menu's were easy to navigate and we had no issues with lag playing the Wii that some other reviews talked about.  All in all, we are very happy with our purchase.  My only wish was that there was a way to auto-adjust the picture for non-HD sources.  Our Comcast box does not carry HD and some of the shows would be in different formats that require us to adjust the picture display from the TV remote from normal to zoom or to wide in order to fill the full screen.  But this isn't a huge deal, plus we purchased an audio/video receiver (Dennon's AVR-791) which now automatically upgrades any signal to 1080p so we no longer have this issue.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "vizio 55", "Author": "A.

You'll want to turn off the ambient light detection if you use infrared remotes too.  There are fewer picture settings than on my Sharp HDTV, which is both a good and a bad thing.  My other TV had more adjustments than wanted or even knew what to do with.  On the other hand, my Sharp had the ability to manually set the refresh rate, including a 24fps \"film\" mode, which I miss.  I also don't like the big \"VIZIO\" splash screen everytime you turn it on either.  On the other hand, I do like the illuminated logo that is white when the tv is on and orange when it is off.

Problems I have center around the poor sound controls and horrible, horrible lag times with satellite tv and DVR.A workaround on the sound lag that seems to help quite a bit is to ensure the TV is put in GAME mode from the MENU --> PICTURE submenu. This picture mode gives you no contrast, brightness or color control, but it has an option called FAST RESPONSE that helps to keep the audio and video processing in sync. Outside of GAME mode, this television is useless.Sound controls feature a logarithmic gain that makes absolutely no sense. From 0-2 the sound goes from zero gain to too-loud-for-a-sleeping-partner. From 30-60 there is really little difference. I don't know who designed it, but they clearly didn't test their work in real life surroundings. Vizio's proprietary TRU VOLUME controls cause the sound to arbitrarily get louder and quieter, and is terrible when viewing sports. Again, product designers apparently didn't test before sending to market!In the final analysis, if you're on a tight budget this may be a good choice. The picture is very good, even  in GAME mode (required if you have satellite TV or plan on doing any gaming), and the sound, though weak, is acceptable and it's shortcoming can be circumvented by purchasing an inexpensive Dolby sound system.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good TV...

Vizio TV's are cheap, and they appear to give you the biggest bang for your buck, but they simply to no work as promised.  I purchased a Vizio XVT553SV which, at the time, was their flagship model.  Immediately, it had video artifacts/flickering on every input (Dish, PS3, media player).  Vizio's website even admits to this and promises that a firmware update and clean storage procedure would fix this!!! Vizio updated the firmware, and the issue appeared to be resolved for a few weeks, but then returned.  Vizio customer support had me do a power recycle, which resolved the issue for a few weeks, but, again the issues returned and new ones appeared - the video would freeze upon a cold start-up, the TV would turn off automatically in the middle of watching TV for no reason whatsoever. Vizio technical support had me do clean storage procedure which appeared to resolve the issue for a few days, but then the issues again returned.  Technical support  also admitted that the issue of the TV turning off intermittently will still be an issue until Vizio updates the firmware and they are looking into this issue now.  Through these issues, we could still watch TV - the issues were merely a nagging nuisance.  Finally fed up and fearful that the TV would fail once out of the warranty period, I called Vizio and they sent out a Technician to replace the logic board.  Within an hour after the technician left, the TV failed altogether.  Vizio now wants to replace my new TV that was defective upon arrival with a recertified TV which I objected to.  In order to get a new TV, they want me to pay an extra $300.00 plus tax!

She said she would be upset but this is their corporate policy.  So, buy a Vizio at your own risk - because it is very risky to do so.  Incredible that Vizio would put out a product knowing that it had existing defects and then screwing customers over!!.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1080p Full HD\n120Hz refresh rate\n100,000 to 1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio\nSRS TruVolumeTM and SRS TruSurround HDTM audio\nExceeds Energy StarTM 4.0 guidelines", "Name": "VIZIO E550VL 55-inch Full HD 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV (2010 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41REllQk3OL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003GDDIW0"}}
