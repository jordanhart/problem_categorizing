I didnt have to adjust any really at all. Just set it in game mode, plugged it into my computer and ran with it.Sound is pretty much standard to me, but I'm not an audiophile. It isn't blowing me away cause its amazing but it is not bad at all.I was also leery about ordering a tv online with the shipping, so I overnighted it. It was shipped well and came in one puece without damage. So that made me happy. Only really bad part about it is I had to put the stand together, and thats kinda reaching for something since it took longer to find a screwdriver then put the stand together.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Smart HdTv", "Author": "ALDO", "ReviewID": "R5O99U49AL0MD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "$350.at Wal-Mart...very nice SMART TV.
