I bought this item in a used condition over 7 Months ago, so far I am very satisfied with this TV. The TV was if perfect visual, and cosmetic condition. Since the TV is an LED type, the picture display are really nice and bright, the size and dimesion is great, small enough to fit in a back pack, plus it is very light weight.  The TV did not come with the power supply or remote. but it was not a problem as this was stated by the seller, and obtaing a universal remote, and a universal power cord, was really easy. so I would rate this item 5 out 5.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent entry model HDTV", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2FZUOUO26HRT3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nothing flashy here, no bells and whistles, but if you want a smaller tv that's capable of 1080p and won't cost you a kidney, this is a decent choice.  This item was chosen to replace an older tube tv in the master bedroom, so it wasn't expected to deliver a home cinema experience.  Bearing that in mind, the speakers put out decent enough sound and, at a viewing distance of 15 feet, text is readable without squinting.  It has enough inputs to accommodate a cable box, a Roku, and a video game console and the viewing angle is wide enough for family movie night with everyone spread out on and around the bed.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Look Closely on these", "Author": "DubF", "ReviewID": "R2W4MQS018LLMG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A little irked with the scratch that was on it, and the fact that it's only got one HDMI port.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This Television Provides The Viewer With The Ultimate Movie Experience\nGreat For Watching Cable, Gaming, And Computers,\nHDMI, VGA, And Much More", "Name": "INSIGNIA NS-22E430A10 22-INCH LED HDTV 1080 p", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-GaMvU9LL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004SQKXS6"}}
