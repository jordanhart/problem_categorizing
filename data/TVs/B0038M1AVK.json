Got if for my grandmother to replace her 500 year old tube tv. She needed something simple so she wouldn't need lots of remotes and chaining inputs and stuff to watch  a DVD. The tv has fine picture, not great. If you are looking for a sharp nice pictures get quality brand like Vizio, Samsung, Sony, etc.... there is a reason they cost more. BUT for her It works just perfectly and she can watch some DVDs and Cable. So five stars to that.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "About what I expected for the money", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R3R0MFI4GS4M4D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ok, going into this purchase I understood that I wasn't buying a top of the line piece of electronic equipment, but when something is listed as a feature I expect it to work as advertised. All I have been able to get out of the built in dvd player is 480i resolution. For something that advertises an upscaling dvd player as part of the package, that is unacceptable. It may be that I haven't found something in the settings, but if it's there I also can't find it in the documentation or through emailing tech support.Another issue with this tv is that the sound level seems set to one output -LOUD.Those issues aside, the tv is cheap. For my purposes (preschool age kids' playroom), it suits it's purpose as something that may accidentally get damaged by a flying wiimote. Any other purpose and I would return this for something else.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "could do alot worse", "Author": "professer", "ReviewID": "R2DCG1CEACE3UD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "its really got a great picture for a 720 hdtv. i love all the extra features on this tv. we also use it in our rv when we go fishing. the dvd player is very handy. then we can take the memory card out of the camera and check out our fishing pictures on our tv. i just love it.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does what it needs to do", "Author": "Michael J.

I love it's high impact black look and all the great extra features that allow you to have a wide variety of options, but unless you have a working remote control, you can count on this television doing nothing more than looking good. The remote that came with the television had working batteries included but we didn't know it until we put a fresh AAA set in. The remote simply doesn't work. There is only so much you can do manually, you really NEED a working remote control. Now we have to buy a universal remote and hopefully that will solve the problem.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "reat deal for the price......if lasting", "Author": "oly", "ReviewID": "RJOIXRVB3WS7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coby TFDVD3295 32-Inch 720p Widescreen LCD HDTV/Monitor with DVD Player and HDMI Input (Black)Great deal for the price... if lasting.

Unfortunately the volume control did not work properly.  There was no grading of volume.  Even on level 1, it was very loud,as loud as level 15, making it impossible to watch in the night for fear of disturbing others.  I also had some trouble with it taking in a dvd disc.  It strained a while before it could get the disc in and it occurred repeatedly.I had to return.

Power came on just fine. Slapped a DVD in it and played with the volume. That was one of the comments on a review, that the volume was not good. Well that was not true the volume is ok, but the speakers; sound quality is what is hurting it. Ran the DVD player for about 1.5 hours worked great, hooked up the satellite system and program it that took about 10-15 minutes. Played with all the different settings it has for about an hour, so in all I had it on for about 3 1/2 hours found no big problems. I shut it off and on about dozen times fired right back up. Again another comment was the TV is slow to come on well this is true however it is much faster than my computer is. But it does take about 5-7 seconds. I can remember the warm up time was much longer with vacuum tubes. So, I think 5-7 seconds is very tolerable. For me!So in a nutshell I give it 3 starts for:1) Speakers sound quality is fair2) History has not shown that this flat screen will last, I hope to report that this is false in the future and that will change its ratingSide note: I will hook up a pair of better speakers just to see what effect it has on the sound.

If I did end up having a problem with it, I had the 30 days to return, so I went ahead and took a chance. I set it up and everything works fine. But don't expect a perfect tv. The issue I have with the tv is when I turn the set off it makes some type of noise shortly after you turn the tv off. It isn't a very loud or intrusive sound, but it's there nonetheless.  It hasn't caused any type of problem so far and I typically unplug the television after using it because I watch tv so seldom. (Unplugged it makes no noise.)

On the surface, all looks good, nice remote and slick TV.  Surprises start soon:1) The unit came with about 6 channels set up for the regular \"lowest quality -- through the air\" TV input source.  Looks like someone else used it before, though I bought it as \"new\"2) I switched source to HDMI, which is what my cable box is set to.  HDMI worked fine in 480p,l 720p, 1080p.  BUT: turn the TV off, or switch to DVD and back to TV, and input source is back to \"air\" TV.3) Nothing to do, tried all factory resets, etc.  never can get the unit to stick to HDMI input source, and also cannot get rid of pre-programmed channels.4) DVD works, but it has 3 buttons on it which do not appear to do anything and are not mentioned in manual.  Not reassuring.5) As an engineer, I figure \"there must be a hidden factory reset sequence\" which may clear all of this up.  So I send two emails to \"Technical Support\" -- no response after a week (yes, I checked my spam folder)6) Called the tech support number on a Tuesday, midday.  Am told they experiencing \"higher than normal call volume\".  I hold persistently, through all annoying messages \"we'll be with you shortly\".  After 35 minutes of hold a tech comes on wanting to know my name, phone number and physical address.  Finally we get to the point.  She checks with a number of technicians.  All suggested \"reset\" actions I had already tried on my own, none work.  Final outcome:  \"Sorry, you will have to always switch from air TV to HDMI (a complicated 6-stroke sequence) *every time* you turn on the TV -- that's just the design of this TV.  Can I do anyting else for you today?\"  Shrugging on my 2ndary request re pre-programmed channels that I cannot change.I am returning this unit to Amazon, a bit disappointed, as I am not used to buying defective or terribly-designed products from them.Will never buy another Coby product.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "32-Inch widescreen TFT LCD Integrated slot-loading DVD player upconverts DVD video to near-HD quality (720p)\nDVD, DVD\u00b1R/RW, CD, CD-R/RW, and JPEG compatible, plays digital media directly from USB flash drives and SD cards, DTV-ready with dual ATSC/NTSC tuners\nHDMI digital connection for perfect AV signal transmission, HDCP compliance for HDCP content support\nAV input jacks for use with media players, DVR/VCRs, video games, and more. 15-pin VGA interface for use with computer systems, Full-range stereo speakers (6W)\nDigital comb filter and noise reduction, V-chip parental control, Closed-Caption, and Electronic Program Guide support,  Multi-language on-screen display, Wall-mountable design (VESA 400mm x 200mm)\n31.5 inch diagonal TFT LCD widescreen HDTV (720p)\nDTV-ready with dual ATSC/NTSC tuners\nDVD, DVD\u00b1R/RW, CD, CD-R/RW, and JPEG compatible\nIntegrated slot-loading DVD player upconverts DVD video to near-HD quality\nPlays digital media directly from USB flash drives and SD cards (cards not included)", "Name": "Coby TFDVD3295 32-Inch 720p Widescreen LCD HDTV/Monitor with DVD Player and HDMI Input (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mlBMFVy2L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0038M1AVK"}}
