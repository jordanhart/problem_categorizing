{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far, so good", "Author": "Mark Biz", "ReviewID": "R3ECRJM0WFEN9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just picked this up yesterday and I'm happy so far with this TV.  We needed it to replace a busted computer monitor that we mostly used for spreadsheets and music playing.  Really like the features on this, my first, smart TV (and LED for that matter).Pros:* Easy Setup.  Wireless LAN, Netflix, Pandora, Vudu setup in a flash* Wireless (and Wired) Functionality works out of the box.  Unlike some other companies, Philips provides a wireless dongle (in the form of a thumb drive) that attaches discreetly behind the screen, at no additional cost. Nice!* Nice picture so far.  I haven't connected it to my cable service or PC but YouTube, HuluPlus previews and other video channels look great.  Colors are vibrant and picture is bright.* Multiple Video Connections.  Initially, I had my concerns of how to connect to my PC because the box only mentions the three HDMI connections and my graphics card doesn't support that.  However, there are additional VGA, Component and Composite connections available.  Coaxial input also available for cable connection.* USB port for videos, music and pics* Decent sound and built-in equalizer for some fine tuningCons:* PC Resolution.  If you're using this as a PC monitor you'll max out at 1360x768 according to the manual (haven't checked this out yet)* Bit of a pain to use the remote control to type my email address while setting up all the services.  Not a fault of Philips, most manufacturers have this same approach.  Wouldn't it be nice to attach a USB keyboard for that initial setup?  It's got a USB connection for goodness sake.* No booming bass (but I'm spoiled by my home theater setup)Overall, great value and quality for the price (found it under 250 greenbacks).UPDATE - After 4 months of use I'm still completely happy with this purchase.  After a recent firmware update, there are now some new apps to check out.  Pictures look great watching Hulu Plus and while connected to my PC.  The max PC resolution of 1360x768 works for me as I'm not playing the latest graphics-heavy video game, simple spreadsheets and media player only.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tv", "Author": "Keith S. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3ELZVMNOZQFEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We needed a modest sized flat-panel tv that could go on our rolling stand.  We also wanted to use external speakers, so a headphone output jack was essential.  Surprisingly, we found many other tvs in the 26\" size don't have such a jack -- really dumb.  Anyway, this is our third Philips tv (4 if we count a crt model decades back) and I'm v. impressed with the quality.  In this case the tv can stream wireless signals - tho have not needed that.  As usual, the remote is first class, clear and easy to use.  Surprisingly, many tvs have ergonomically terrible remotes, but not Philips.  So, V. pleased with the tv in all respects (including picture, sound, and solid construction, metal back for instance, not just plastic).", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Philips flat screen tv", "Author": "Laura \"laura\"", "ReviewID": "R2B430BC030F88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this tv. After getting a 40\" Sony for the living room, I needed another flat screen for bedroom. Since we have a small area to work with, the 26\" was perfect. We have it in a corner using the full swivel wall hanger. What I love the most about this tv is the volume doesn't change when there is a commercial, which can be very annoying. Great picture and sound quality. This is a smart tv as is the Sony. After much research on line and in stores I couldn't even come close to Amazon's price. I would recommend Philips 26\".", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product support, long start-up, fair amount of set-up", "Author": "Sally Alleyseed \"gardenersal\"", "ReviewID": "R3FF6O5N4K9YMB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV.  I bought this model because it was reviewed in Consumer Reports.  It received only a fair rating, but none in this size (26\") did any better.  It has Wifi, which you use by putting a permanent USB drive (supplied) in the TV.  It takes a long time to warm up and get to a TV picture, but I think that is because it does not sleep (which uses electricity).The documentation is horrible, but the phone support people are great and not out-sourced.  Sometimes you have to resize the picture yourself when the faces look too wide or too thin.  There is a button on the remote and you cycle through.  I downloaded an upgrade, so maybe this problem is solved.There is a set-up program at the beginning that asks you which side of the picture you prefer.  This is supposed to get your color, etc, settings right for you, but I had to go in and manually adjust a too-brown picture (not hard to do).I would give this 3.5 stars if I could because I had to do this amount of work to set it up, but I don't know if this is an ordinary amount.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's smart.", "Author": "catelse", "ReviewID": "R3KJGW9CCN9MWM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded from a 20-year-old 19\" tube to this model.  As a second TV (in the office), it is great.  I like the smart functions, especially the automatic streaming from Netflix and YouTube.  It is a bit slow to turn on, about 10 seconds.  I suppose that is because it functions more like a computer than a tv?", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "poor picture quality", "Author": "Sara Smith", "ReviewID": "R2G9XTUY2U1ELF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am happy to have Wi-Fi built into this TV.

Unfortunately, at present there is no Amazon app so streaming Amazon Prime is not possible.  Also, when streaming Netflix through the TV's WiFi,television is incapable of reformatting picture to fill screen. You must watch programming in original format, sometimes with bars either on sides, or top and bottom of screen. Brought these matters to Philips's attention and they concurred in my observations and that there were no fixes for either issue at this time.

This TV is everything I wanted, it's slim, has touch sensitive buttons, the remote is nice and the picture and sound are great. The stand doesn't raise the height of the TV too much which makes the TV appear more low profile and fits under my desk. It has audio out and plenty of connection ports, HDMI, VGA and USB being the most important. It doesn't weigh too much and is great for Xbox.

Originally I was looking for The Sony Google TV (NSX-24GT1). Very hard to find. SMH. Televisions under 32\", WITH FEATURES!!, are becoming increasingly rare. In my search I made note of this tv. It doesnt have a web browser But it does have apps. The apps are pretty basic. Netflix, Youtube, Pandora, and some other things. I have pretty good signal strength via wifi. Its definitely not going to reach past 30' as it states. From a five bar signal I moved about 15 feet and it dropped to 3 bars. The picture is as good as you can get with 1080 and 60hz.
