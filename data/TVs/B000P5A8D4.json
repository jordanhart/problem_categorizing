Setup was very easy, given the multiple choices provided by the large number of input options.My only negative, so far, is the mediocre sound system.  Admittedly, I have not tried, yet, to play with the sound adjustment options (bass, treble, etc.).  Instead I added a home theater system and, for the most part, use it for my sound.Overall, for the  price, I would rate this a must have for those seeking a very large screen 1080p HDTV.", "Date": "November 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent HD Home Theater TV", "Author": "Garry Amann \"archer\"", "ReviewID": "R1CDW8B38TOEKC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Mits 73733 provides excellent home theater experience, particularly in situations where lighting can be controlled. When the color setting is Natural and brightness at 50% (31), the colors are exceedingly realistic, but it needs to not be in direct sunlight. It has a Vivid setting for that, but the colors do not seem as true. Viewing from 10 ft fills the vision nicely. There are no artifacts visible that are common to DLP. The 6-gun strategy seems to work well. Combined with DirecTV HDDVR and 70 HD channels, it is fantastic. Football is like being on the field. MTV HD with the story tellers show is breathtaking on this TV. Movies are fantastic. This is close to overhead projection size and is great color and detail. I do have a very good sound system as the TV speakers only ok. Using a DVI-HDMI cable with my computer provided excellent display on the TV. As far as the up level models, I did not need the features of the 734/833. Good delivery service through Amazon, great price on TV+stand.", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "P.

I am a Dishnetwork subscriber, their service is first rate.The delivery service from Amazon was excellent; the driver help me bring the TV to the 2nd floor-thank God it only weights ~80 lbs; less than the base unit--and he took all the boxes with him!The installation was very easy--except Mitsu does not provide an HDMI cable--I just happened to have a spare one; I did buy the HDMI cable v1.3 on Ebay for less than $10 with shipping. Ebay is the place to buy the bulb too, for less than $150.No fan noise problem, it was easy to adjust the color scheme to my liking.Sound system: I am surprized to read some of the comments on the cheap speakers...They are there to get you started quickly.This 73\" TV is for a home theater system and it should be hooked up to a good sound system; if you don't have one, you need to get one.I used it with the upconverting Oppo Digital 980 DVD player for all my old DVD's (480I), using HDMI cable, with excellent resultsThe colors are awesome, the HD picture quality is awesome, the price is awesome ( a 73\" plasma is ~$8000, weights over 225 lbs, making a 3 man job!)If you don't need to mount your wide screen TV on a wall, this is the way to go!!Get the largest TV that you can afford, you will quickly get use to it!!", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "WOW!

Reedy", "ReviewID": "R2CPJVMB8U105A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this TV after a lot of research. I saw a floor model at a local superstore for about $700 more than the Amazon price - and they didn't sell the matching base. I ordered the set on a Tuesday and it was delivered the following Saturday - five days early! How often does that happen? There are a few reviews that talk about loud fan noise. I honestly don't hear it. I sit about 12 feet back from the TV and can hear a mild whir when there is no sound - like between commercials. However, taken in context, it's about a tenth of the noise an XBox 360 makes. As for the TV speakers, I have no comment, I haven't listened to them. I have a good home theater system (which I would expect anyone buying a large screen TV to have) that completely negates the need to listen through the speakers. The picture is brilliant - bright and crisp. I have both Blu-ray (PS3) and HD-DVD (Toshiba HD-A20) and they both look amazing in 1080p. The level of detail has to be seen to be believed. Gaming has never been more fun. There are plenty of inputs to spare. Between the TV, my receiver and a Psyclone HDMI switch, I have all of my peripherals hooked up with more ports available, although I'm stumped as to what else I'd need to connect. If you've got the room for it, you will not be disappointed by this TV. The matching stand is great too. It holds all my equipment and looks sharp. It comes mostly assembled - maybe 10 minutes to finish.", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Outstanding picture, mediocre sound", "Author": "William D.

However, the sound from the built-in speakers leaves something to be desired.  Regardless of the settings, it always sounds \"tinny\".  This was especially evident during the Super Bowl.  Now, this won't be a problem if you have it connected to your home theater system, but then you'll either have another remote to deal with or you'll have to get one of those universal remotes.Either way, this purchase was WELL worth the money.

I had looked at it in the store before purchasing it and I really liked the pic. and size. But in my house its a different story. On my tv stande that sits about 18\" off the floor the top of the TV is almost as tall as me. Then news people are full size. The deliverey people couln't have been better.

Ramadanovic", "ReviewID": "R4VQUS8O3JSDM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased one of these units on Amazon after reading the reviews.The main complaints I came across before purchasing werea)poor built in soundb)unit fan is loudAfter purchasing the unit I can say that a is a ridiculous knock because anyone who is getting such a high end TV will also get external speakers so you can do surround sound. The built in sound is as functional as any normal TV but the audio output options in the TV menu make it clear that it is designed to be used with a audio receiver/real speaker system.Once I got that hooked up I was again amazed.If you are the type who buys a TV for the screen and a speaker system for the speakers you won't be disappointed.B is completely unfounded (unless, I suppose, you have the unit in a closet or so tight against a wall the fan has to run full bore to keep the unit cool. The room I have it in allows me to sit so I am around 9 to 10 feet away from the screen when seated which is more than enough. With  this setup (the unit is maybe 6 inches off the wall) I never hear the thing. With my eyes closed I can certainly not tell if it is on or off. It gets no hotter than a typical desktop pc power supply.As for quality I find it amazing. HD TV looks fantastic until you try an HD DVD. HD DVD is so good it makes HD TV look like analog cable. Colors look absolutely stunning (and remember, no burn in). I can think of nothing bad to say about the unit.Overall the unit is underrated. I almost didn't buy it because the local stores where I went to see it did such a poor job setting it up. It is large so if you have it sit flat on the floor while you put some smaller unit on a stand right next to it the difference in angles is so extreme that that it makes it make the larger unit appear dim in comparison. If  both units are on stands you can clearly see that the picture looks as bright and as good as any smaller unit. Worth the money but don't pay the extra $2K for the special remote. It is the same screen and a $100 logitech universal remote works just fine with it.", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "My Favorite TV", "Author": "John Stack", "ReviewID": "R3MVMI9X61N91F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV as a Christmas present to myself last December, and it has been great ever since the delivery man and I set it up.  The picture is extremely clear in 1080i (I haven't upgraded to HDMI cables yet so I'm not running 1080p).  I haven't had any problems at all.  The fan is a little louder than on my old 42\" panasonic TV but what do you expect with such a large set?  I don't hear it over my 7.1 channel surround sound - so it is a non-issue.This is an excellent TV if you have a nice corner spot to set it up in.

I strongly suggest purchasing the matching stand. I installed it single handidly (with the help of a ottoman). I found no flaws so far.Be Warned: As of last week this unit started developing spots in he upper left corner of the screen.  Little light dots.  First one, then three and now, each day, another one or two have been increasing across to the right side of the screen.  Doing a google search on spots discovered a problem with the DLP chip in these and other Mitsubishi DLP TVs.  The best fix seems to be to attempt to replace the DLP chip yourself.
