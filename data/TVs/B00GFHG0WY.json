I did a lot of research and comparison shopping before I settled on the Hisense Sero Pro 7. The specs on this model were as good or better than other brands. I took a chance and bought the Hisense. So, when it came time to buy a new tv it was a no brainer. I've had it for a week now and it is of the same quality as the tablet. Looking for a tv ? In my opinion you can't go wrong with the Hisense for quality and value!", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV.", "Author": "Gregory Williams", "ReviewID": "R1THNYN26U5P66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with my Hisense 32in.

Fantastic compared to the last 32\" TV I bought last year that blew a fuse within the 90 days. I am watching this Netlix show and I am just amazed with the clarity. Great gaming, Netflix, Youtube viewing and...the sound is great for a small bedroom (I'm on a lower setting for the room 14 level and it's not even a quarter up the volume level). Good stuff, thank you LG for helping me get my video game action on during my school break and yes, when I play video games it's all for research :)...", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$349.99", "Features": "720p HDTV: Full High Definition Picture Quality, 39\" Class (39\" viewable)\n60Hz Refresh Rate: Good for everyday viewing\nHDMIx2, Composite, Component, USB, Digital Audio and Headphone Output", "Name": "Hisense 39A320 39-inch 720p 60Hz LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bl1Nezq6L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GFHG0WY"}}
