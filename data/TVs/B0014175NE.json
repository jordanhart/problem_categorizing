Ramirez", "ReviewID": "RNIJ7FX3NV7G5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, Amazon's white glove delivery service was great. I was a little hesitant about buying a TV of this size online but now that I've gone through the process I would do it again in a heart beat.For those of you who have been following the news on the A650s, the reset issue has been fixed with the latest firmware. Chances are you will have to upgrade the firmware yourself when the TV arrives but it is pretty simple procedure using a USB thumb drive and Samsung provides step by step instructions with photos if you need them.I've had my TV for about four days now and I'm still completely blown away by clarity, detail and colors this set produces. The LN40A650 has three HDMI inputs on the back, and one HDMI input on left side which made my devices incredibly easy to hook up. I then watched Ratatouille followed by Apocalypto, both on Blu-ray - great movies to show off your new set.The 40\" is the only model in the 6 series that has a fan built into the screen. Some people may be put off because of this but the good news is that this fan is completely inaudible. This weekend we had 90 degree Santa Ana winds here in California and even with out any air conditioning, I still couldn't hear the fan.When I first saw the Touch of Color online I was indifferent. I don't really care for the color red but now that I have the set, it's slowly growing on me. All of the stock Samsung photos show a vibrant red but with my 40A650 in the living room it has the perfect amount of color. It's not strong enough to steal my focus away while watching TV but at the same time it looks great when the TV is shut off. I believe the rest of the colors have been announced so if red isn't your thing then it's just a matter of time.The glossy piano black of the A650s does cause reflections at times but I don't consider it to be a deal breaker. It's easier to notice the reflections during the day but I still experimented with light placement so that lamp reflections were not visible at night. Most of the time I only notice the reflections when I'm actively looking for them and it has never interfered with my viewing experience but it's something to consider.While you're not going to get any realistic surround sound out of the built in speakers,  they do come with a little power if needed. I'll be upgrading to a 5.1 system pretty soon and the built in speakers are more than enough to hold me over. If you're not planning on using anything but the built in speakers then the 7 series television might interest you with it's built in subwoofer.[...]Overall I'm extremely pleased with the LN40A650 and my purchase experience through AmazonQUICK UPDATE: September 30th 2008. No problems to report. It has now been 5 1/2 months and I still love this TV.", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "I love this tv!", "Author": "Bjornstam \"book lover\"", "ReviewID": "R3ETTNSW81DL1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before deciding on this Samsung.  I wanted 1080p with Auto Motion Plus 120Hz, and I wanted at least a 40 inch screen.  After spending about 30 or 40 hours comparing this model with comparable models, I bought this on Amazon and I have been absolutely thrilled!  The picture was beautiful right out of the box, and the HD signals from my DirecTV satellite are transformed into the clearest, sharpest images I have ever seen on a television.  We can't wait for the prices on Blu Ray players to drop so that we can start watching all our movies in high definition!  The sound from the speakers is fine, but you will need external speakers and a receiver (or an HTIB) to get the best audio experience.  For people who have lots of A/V sources, this tv has four HDMI inputs, so you aren't going to run out of inputs anytime soon.  In fact, I only use one HDMI cable from my Yamaha RX-V663BL 665 Watt 7.1-Channel Home Theater Receiver.The \"Touch of Color\" feature wasn't a factor in my purchase, but it looks terrific in our living room and matches our color scheme very nicely.  I was a bit wary about buying a television online, but Amazon made the transaction super smooth - delivery was super fast and FREE.  Overall, I felt this model offered terrific value and performance, and I have been completely satisfied.  If you are viewing from a distance of 10 feet or more, get the 46 inch or larger.", "Date": "May 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "This is the TV you've been waiting for", "Author": "Elwhite1", "ReviewID": "R1HB9KS3U0FUTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After months of researching all the different LCDs out there, this TV beats the hands down. At first I had ordered the 4071 from Amazon, then 2 days later after it was too late to cancel I saw this TV which has twice the contrast ration and half the responce time for only $50 dollars more than what I paid for the 4071. The CEVA shipping was excellent, the TV arrived a week sooner than estimated.Pros: Excellent unbelievable picture that you have to see to believe. I watched 300 and Troy on Blu-ray through my PS3 and it was amazing. It's like looking out your window and watching an epic battle. The 120hz really brings out the full potential of the movies. The 120hz also is great for gaming. While playing Oblivion it definitly adds smoothness to the environment and the movement of characters. The differemce it completely night and day. The Touch of Color is pretty cool it's very subtle where it gives a nice accent without being too over powering. I was almost worried I wouldn't be able to see it, whenever I would go to Circuit City or Best Buy I could never see it. I have the TV placed in my bedroom with a cielling light and a window across from the TV and have experienced no ploblems with glare.Cons: It's a dust magnet I'v had it less than I week and it's already getting a thin layer of dust on it. The remote is ok, they could've done w/o the rotating directional control.Conclusion: If you are looking for a high quality tv at a reasonalbe price look no further than this. Believe me I've looked. Don't kop out and sell yourself short and just get any TV. Save and invest the extra money into getting a top of the line TV without a top of the line price. I guarantee you once you've seen this picture you won't be sorry.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Just a warning", "Author": "B.

I bought this TV and within 1 day there was vertical lines showing up.  Within 1 week there were several different color lines.  Samsung contacted a local TV repair to fix it and I was not impressed with the repair shop.  They wanted to order a new LCD panel to replace it which would take 2 weeks just to come in.  I was already out the TV 2 weeks.  I said forget it and return it back to me so I can just return it back to amazon within the 30day return policy.  I do not want a brand new TV that has been taken a part and possibly fixed correctly.The TV is very nice, obviously I got a lemon.  I will probably just buy the same model again.  I do not like the 120hz option.  It makes the scenes look awkward and not natural.  So I just turned it off.", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture quality and amazing features with very minor annoyances", "Author": "Jonathan Focarino", "ReviewID": "R179QAHUV5CKAK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Amazing picture quality. Great connectivity options and features.Cons: Click wheel remote is inaccurate. CEVA shipping will cause you headaches if you live in the metropolitan New York area. Auto motion plus will cause stuttering on medium to high setting.  The Samsung 40a650 is the best LCD on the market right now. The picture quality is fantastic and the connectivity and features are plentiful. The touch of red outlining the frame is very subtle and does not distract from viewing whatsoever.  There are a few minor issues, but nothing to deter from a purchase. First, the click wheel remote is inaccurate and has slow response. The menu system however, is fairly easy to navigate and features large readable text.  The shipping from CEVA is horrible. Expect more than your fair share of headaches. They changed my delivery time without consulting me and then showed up when I was at work. I re-scheduled and they dropped my TV off at the curb and I had to bring it up my driveway myself. They then asked me to sign a form that said they were willing to set up the TV wherever I asked them too. I live in Long Island, NY so experiences will vary depending on your location. On a related note, Amazon can be difficult to deal with as well. They outsource a great deal of their customer service to India and there is definitely difficulty in communication. I needed to change my shipping address and they were uncooperative and offered little to no solution to the problem.  I am an avid gamer and the Xbox 360 looks amazing. Games look sharp and detailed. The brightness of the LCD screen really helps when playing darker games like Bioshock. The flowing water was smooth thanks to the auto motion plus (low) and the game mode created a very believable surround sound effect.  Lastly, the auto motion plus is improved, but not perfected. On low is provides a nice smoothing effect that lessens blur and judder. This is especially evident in camera pans and credits. It makes motion in games much smoother as well. The downside is that stuttering will occur on medium and especially on high. Be warned if the 120 Hz feature is a must have for you. I figured since this feature can be turned off, it's like having any other LCD, but with arguably the most stunning picture quality to date. It's nice to know that the feature is there when you need it.  Overall, this is a great HD television with forgivable imperfections. At the current price point, it's a steal. I recommend purchasing an extended warranty as Samsung has an unfortunate history with some of their LCD panels.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "A wonderful experience", "Author": "S. Kohl", "ReviewID": "R2P0FWTJ5W7QYI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've wanted to wait a few weeks to review(Don't want to jinx anything!)Basically, want to focus on 2 things, the TV itself, and the delivery.First, the TV:It's great, simple as that. The picture is everything an HDTV should deliver. I am hooked up via Directv HD receiver and a regular DVD player for now. I actually bought a Samsung 1400 at the same time, but it's hooked up to my Runco 60\" plasma in the family room. The picture is fantastic and I have no doubt that with Blu Ray, it'll knock my socks off.Although I think the majority of reviews have been very good, there seem to be a few complaints scattered about. I think with virtually any TV, there probably is the occasional one that might be a bad one, but so far, it's great, none of the issues with firmware, blurring, etc. If you want technical- there are plenty of sights for that.What I would highly recommend, is checking it out at somewhere like Bestbuy. The set that was my other choice was the Sony XBR. Pictures were very close, I'd be happy with either. The decider was $500+ less for the Samsung. One other thing- the Sony is much heavier. In my younger days, I kind of assumed that heavier=better. Whether it's true or not, I definitey appreciate the greater ease manipulating the TV now being lighterNow, the DELIVERY:There are a few rather worrisome stories in the reviews, but mine was nothing less than fantastic! First, It was scheduled for \"estimated\" delivery June 9th. There was no rush for me so even a little late would have been fine. Well, I got a call May 30th to see if they could deliver it later that day. As much as I'd have liked to have had it, I couldn't be home, so I asked to reschedule. The man was very nice, said no problem and set it up for the following Tuesday, between 1 and 4. I called that day to dispatch and they confirm.The delivery man was on time, unloaded the TV and brought it in. I helped get it out of the box which was a piece of cake(remember the relative lack of weight). He then helped me move my old TV, about a 150# Sony tube set and then set the new TV up. I connected the HDMI cable in about 20 seconds. Turned it on and I was good to go. He waited to make sure it was working, did the paperwork and that was it! He asked if I wanted him to take out the box, but I figured I'd keep it for a while, just to be sure.By the way, the stand is already connected in the box. I was planning on hanging it on the wall eventually, but it frankly looks fine the way it is with the stand.The remote is a little different then I'm used to, but the backlight function is kind of coolAnyway, I'm now a couple weeks in and still happy. I could have spent more at Bestbuy, etc. but the delivery would not have been any better, except they'd have charged. Look, I'm sure, like me, a lot of people are a little anxious about buying something like this online. Don't be. Wait for what you like, wait for a good deal, free shipping, etc. and don't let the occasional story make you go out and spend more money.I'm waiting for the newer Blu rays to come out to get a new one to pair with it.Hope this soothes some worry people might have; I don't write a lot of reviews, but this one needed to be doneHappy TV!PS---if you're as happy with your delivery as I was, please TIP the guy!", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money", "Author": "D.

A friend recommended I go to Best Buy and compare all the models I was considering - this one blew all the others away - including Sony! (though the Best Buy on 23rd in Manhattan did not have the Sony XBR model so I couldn't compare that).  I still haven't used all the settings but the HD quality is incredible from the cable - haven't even tried blue ray yet but saw that in the store and it was pretty amazing as well.Gripes: the glossy finish will show how much dust gathers in a very short period of time...if you're a neat freak you will find yourself wiping it off constantly.

Ali", "ReviewID": "R3O3K0C0JAAH2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Perfect picture, 120 HZ is great. affordableCons: Body can be scratched with little effort, recent price drop by amazon looks suspicious.After looking at a number of TVs for 3 months, i succeeded in narrowing down to a couple of models from Sony and Samsung. I compared this model with Sony XBR5 side by side,  it was easy to see the difference in quality between the two. A650 showed black, blacker and white whiter, and the contrast was amazing. At $1800, (vs 2300 from fry's at that time) it seemed a great bargain to buy this tv from amazon.The delivery was awesome, i got the TV 5 days in advance and in perfect condition. I would never again hesitate to buy such a priced item from amazon.My old 720P Samsung went into the bedroom. I watched a few movies on my new TV both in standard and high definition and the difference from my old TV was remarkable. The 120Hz enabled smoother motion and i was amazed by the fast moving images. I did not have any problems with glare reflecting from the TV and i personally think that contrast is much better than a matte.The only downside to it is that it can easily be scratched. I tried to clean a side with Bounty napkin, and it left a scratch on it. Luckily i was able to stop early.(...)All in All, if you are looking for the best picture on a 40 inch screen, this would be the perfect choice for movies, sports and video games.", "Date": "May 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Stunning Picture Quality", "Author": "Mark Twain", "ReviewID": "RTXT9NNVW45PZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my LN40A650 for a week now, and I am very happy with this TV. My 1080i Dish TV HD service looks great, and I've got this unit paired with a Sony Playstation 3 for Blu-Ray DVD playback, and it is absolutely awesome seeing films in 1080P.The 120 Hz feature makes a difference, and in the first week of watching I've had it on and left it on (set to \"Medium\") for the entire time. I like the smoothing effect it has, and I rarely I see an objectionable artifact, but by the time you reach for the remote it's likely to have passed. I have not watched any sports yet, and that's the true test of a feature like 120 Hz.As other reviewers have noted, the remote is a bit frustrating -- the iPod-like \"wheel\" really does takes some getting used to, but I picked up a Harmony 550 universal remote and it's now the remote I reach for first. I've seen the Harmony 550 as low as $50 on Amazon.I highly recommend connecting to your video sources via HDMI cables wherever you can, and from what I've read monoprice dot com offers the best quality cables at reasonable prices. I looked at the cheapo cables available here on Amazon, but ended up buying expensive Belkin HDMI cables instead. The cables work just fine, but the reviews I've read on monoprice's cables have all been positive, and they are much cheaper.The 'Ultra Clear Panel' means that the screen has a clear rather than matte finish. My TV is in a room with lots of windows and a large white paper lamp shade -- probably the worst-case scenario for a glossy, reflective TV screen -- and I still would not trade down to a matte screen. The clear screen gives you such a stunning picture, people are amazed and comment on how \"lifelike\" the actors look. I should note that my girlfriend is a little disappointed in the high quality only because Johnny Depp looks \"less dreamy\" in high def... oh well. That's the only complaint I've heard - that the high def does show every wrinkle and blemish...The TV looks great right out of the box, and while you are offered lots of ways to tweak and adjust the picture, chances are you will be happy with just leaving it alone as well. I do recommend running with the 120 Hz feature on, and also setting the panel to \"just scan\" mode. These are one-time settings which I suspect I will leave on at all times. The only other adjustment you might want to make is that the picture is really bright and sharp, a bit too bright in a darkened room, and you might prefer switching the TV to \"movie\" instead of \"standard\" when viewing in a darked room. The \"movie\" mode is a bit too dark in a brightly lit room for my tastes, so I do find that I'm switching back and forth once a day.The \"Touch of Color\" is quite subtle, and not a detriment in my view, and I run the sound through an external AV Receiver and 6.1 speaker setup, so I can't speak to the sound quality of the TV.Overall, I'm extremely happy. Shipping took 7 days total which included a three-day Memorial Day weekend, and the set-up guy was courteous and careful.I looked at a lot of TVs over a 6 month period before settling on this one, and have no regrets. It's a great looking TV.", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great image, great value", "Author": "Isabel M.

I got this one based on specs, reviews and relatively low price vs. other 120Hz HD's, and I am really happy about my choice.  This unit is just great, no complains at all.  Among the pros, in addition to great picture quality, is that it is rather light for the size, and there is no need to buy an upconvert DVD to see your standard DVD's on it.

The bottom line was I visited a local electronics store and this one looked the best.  And it was the most reasonably priced 120Hz flat panel, given other features.Amazon had the best price, by far.  I googled and checked several comp shops.I was a bit apprehensive after reading the reviews about bad service from the shipping company.  However, my experience was very good.  I ordered Friday morning (I actually entered the wrong ship to address, called Amazon, and had it fixed with no problem) and was contacted by the shipper the following Wed and arranged for delivery on the following Fri 8am-12pm.  The truck driver left a message at 7:30am (I requested to be contacted 1/2 hr before drop off) and arrived at our place at 8:15am.  They were courteous and asked whether or not we wanted materials removed and stayed to be sure it could receive channels.The only issue was I was hooking the tv to my computer via HDMI.  Buried in the manual is a comment that you need to set the screen type option to \"just scan\", rather than 4:3 or 16:9.  Otherwise you end up losing some picture around the edges.  It seems that this should be an automatically setup process, rather than having the user hunt through the manual.

There are lots of A?V connections and plenty of picture settings to help customize the TV to just the way you like it.  Be aware that the screen is reflective when it is placed opposite windows (like a lot of TVs).  The \"touch of red\" (around the frame of the set) doesn't bother me, but it may not be for everyone's taste.  The side-to-side viewing angle also seems to be very good for an LCD.  The scroll wheel on the remote needs work (way too sensitive), but you do get used to its quirkiness after a while.My main issue with this TV is that it doesn't seem to play well with the HD set top box from Verizon FIOS.  I upgraded my standard definition FIOS set top box to an HD box about 10 days after I received this TV.  After connecting the TV with the HD box via HDMI, I began experiencing problems with the HD box spontaneously shutting off by itself about once or twice a day.  To reboot the system, I had to disconnect and reconnect the power cord.  After about 2-3 weeks of trying to troubleshoot this issue with Verizon tech support, one of the techs finally asked me what kind of TV I had connected to the HD box.  When I identified the Samsung model, the tech said that Verizon had received a lot of calls about this problem from Samsung LCD owners.  She suggested trying to use component cables (instead of HDMI) to connect to the HD box as a fix, but she also said that Verizon was waiting for Samsung to issue a firmware fix for this problem.  I did try using component cables to connect to the HD box for about two more weeks, but the HD box still kept shutting off by itself, so I have decided to downgrade back to an SD box.  I even experienced the problem using a coaxial cable connection (though less frequently).What's more, when I contacted Samsung customer service to ask about this problem, the Samsung rep told me that Samsung had also received other calls from FIOS customers about the issue.  However, she claimed that the problem was with the FIOS HD box, and not with the TV, and that it was the set top box maker (Motorola) that needed to upgrade its firmware and not Samsung.  Needless to say, at this point, I don't know which company (Verzion, Samsung or Motorola) needs to address this issue, but I hope someone does soon.I don't know for a fact if other FIOS customers are having this problem, but unfortunately, it's been disappointing for me not to get to experience the full HD picture capability that this TV has to offer.  And it's too late for me to return or exchange this TV.  I really do enjoy this television, but if you're on FIOS and you really want the full HD experience right now, you may want to consider other makes and/or models.", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV - a few misses (rating = 4.5)", "Author": "VVV \"kjm88\"", "ReviewID": "R26UK9T3YM02D8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, this is an excellent TV and my review focuses on a few points missing from the other reviews that would have been helpful to know when I was \"shopping\" for a new TV -  not that these would have prevented me from buying the Samsung.Second, I own 2 older Panasonic plasmas which were/are considered the best flat panels before LCD's hit the market; so my review is based on features I felt were missing with the Samsung that the Panasonics have.If you intend to mount this unit on the wall and do-it-yourself these missing features will make the job harder:- you'll need to uninstall the table stand BEFORE mounting to the wall.- no lift handles- the input jacks are located on the back vs the bottom, so you must hook up the cables before mounting as opposed to simply plugging in after the TV is mounted. This is a big deal as you will need two people to lift and hold the unit up while someone else plugs in the cables. (Note, there are a few input jacks on the side but if you have several components to hook -up and/or want a clean look after set-up you will  still have to deal with the rear jacks)However, if you intend to use the table top stand you're good to go. The stand is excellent.Usability flaws:Unlike the Panasonics, you must cycle through the inputs via the remote vs. pressing a dedicated button for \"each input\" on the remote.  So to switch from a DVD to video game input you have to cycle through the menu and hit enter vs a one step/direct input change.  This is a big nuisance for me as I regularly switch between different components.The follwoing is an issue with any 42+\" 1080p TV when the viewing distance is within 12', not just the Samsung:- Non HD signals or HD signals of TV shows/movies  >10 years old will appear very fuzzy.  At first I was very disappointed with the picture for these situations  but I discovered that  setting non-HD signals to the 4:3 format and setting the  picture mode to \"cinematic\" made for a more appealing picture.  Now, some people can't stand the black bars in 4:3 mode but that's never been an annoyance for me.Overall, this is an excellent TV that I highly recommend.", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Tv for Home Theatre Newbie", "Author": "Pam", "ReviewID": "R39D419DC5L9R4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have been dying to buy an LCD TV but were intimidated by all the choices out there.  After a lot of research & in-store visits, we decided on this TV from Amazon.  We were all set to buy the A550 but when the price on this one dropped & included free shipping, it was a no-brainer.  I hesitated because of the delivery & we were nervous about setup by ourselves but it was a great experience.White glove delivery in our area (from Phila.) was great.  We did not get a lot of notice - about 3 hours -  but they kept calling en route to update us on their ETA & did deliver on Saturday afternoon.  They could not have been more professional.  They unpacked it & had us check to make sure it works before leaving.  My only caveat would be concern about the outcome if we had not been home.Since we had little to hook up to the TV, setup was very easy (easier than our new DVD player!).  Our cable company already has several HD channels online so we were blown away immediately.  We don't need a cable box to get digital or HD so that really made setup a snap.The picture is gorgeous, sound is good for a TV, the remote is very sexy & practical.  I am still discovering all the little tricks to the menus  but I do not find the remote or the TV intimidating or hard to use.  Yes, there is a slight delay when changing channels but that's easy enough to live with.  If there were one perfect TV, DVD, remote or other appliance, everybody would only buy that one!  Once I started thinking of the TV as a computer with a really big monitor, I lost any Fear of Digital. I love all the channel info that you can get, including the lineup for the next 12 hours - instant TV Guide!

I haven't received my TV yet, and I expect it will be great when I get it.  When I ordered the TV on Dec. 2 the webpage touted a free \"White Glove\" delivery service with the following language, which is still on the webpage:  \"FREE White-Glove Delivery When You Purchase From Amazon.com  After your purchase, an agent will call you within five days to arrange delivery.\"Based on this, I expected to receive a call \"to arrange delivery\" within 5 days of my purchase date of Dec. 2.  It is now Dec. 11, and still no call to arrange delivery.  My estimated delivery date as shown on the Amazon tracking system hasn't yet arrived, and I'm hopeful the TV will show up on or before that estimated date, as things from Amazon usually seem to, but I think Amazon needs to remove or revise their \"Free White Glove\" delivery information if in fact calls to arrange delivery are not being made within 5 days of purchase.P.S.:  adding to the mystery of the delivery process is the fact the Amazon \"track your package\" service has now shown three different \"arrival scan\" dates for my TV order in Washington DC, which is near where I live.  The first one shown was 12/8, which then changed to  12/10, and now the arrival scan info shows a 12/11 date.  What gives?  I've emailed Amazon to find out what's up.12/12 update:  I found another new \"arrival scan\" date of 12/12 this morning.  Also this morning, more than 20 hours after I had emailed Amazon asking about the delivery, I had no response back.  (They say on their website that they usually respond to emails within 12 hours.)  So, I called Amazon and they gave me the number for the CEVA delivery service, and I called them and they said they have the TV and will deliver it this pm.  Good news, but a customer shouldn't have to work this hard to find out where things are and get them delivered, especially when Amazon touts a \"White Glove\" delivery service. I know this is their busy season, but again I suggest that, during the busy season at least, Amazon consider altering its website representations regarding (1) calling to schedule \"White Glove\" delivery service within 5 days of purchase and (2) responding to emails within 12 hours.  They did neither of these in my case.12/15 update:  finally got my TV, but only after a final adventure with the \"White Glove\" delivery service.  I was walking home from the subway station near my home on Friday evening and spotted the CEVA truck driving around my neighborhood, turning on to a couple of streets, but not mine.  I flagged them down and asked if they were looking for my house, and they said yes, so I jumped in the cab and showed them how to get to my house, which was only about 1/10 of a mile from where they were, but their GPS was telling them to look for my cul-de-sac on the left when in fact it is on the right.  I love the TV and will review it separately, and it did arrive two days ahead of the estimated arrival date, but probably only because I actively pursued getting it delivered, as described above.  Lesson learned with this purchase:  don't rely on Amazon's \"White Glove\" delivery representation about being contacted within 5 days of purchase to arrange delivery and don't rely on their representation about receiving a response to customer service emails within 12 hours.  Amazon did give me a $30 credit, which was a nice gesture.I JUST DISCOVERED I CAN'T POST A SEPARATE TV REVIEW, SO I REVIEW THIS AMAZING TV BELOW:  My troubles with the \"White Glove\" delivery service and Amazon customer service were well worth getting this amazing TV.  The picture is as bright, crisp and colorful as the other reviews all say, and the sound is fine, even without external speakers.  The touch of red color looks great, and the glare from lights in the room is not an issue, and we have this in a very bright, sunlit room near our Christmas tree with old-school big lights on it.  Installation was easy.I will echo the mild complaints about the wheel on the remote and the apparent lack of sensitivity of the remote or the sensor on the TV that requires the remote to be aimed at the lower right hand corner of the set to work.  I simply use the click up, left, right or down features on the remote wheel to avoid spinning the wheel, which I find clumsy and slow to respond, and I just have to remember to point the remote properly.  Not big issues because of the separate satellite remote, and certainly not a reason to pass up this amazing TV.  I will also mention some mild frustration in getting the wireless network adaptor stick (sold separately, as they say) to work on my TV.  After struggling with attempts to activate it and checking a few times online for help on why my attempts weren't working, I discovered a post that suggested downloading a software update from Samsung to fix the connectivity issue with the wireless network, and after I did that it worked like a charm.  If you're having any trouble with your set and haven't done the software update, you should do the update.Bottom line:  this is an amazing TV!", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC is not Strong Enough", "Author": "John N.

This is truely a Fantastic TV in all aspects and above all the price mandates strong consideratioin.Last year I entered the digital HDTV world with a Sony 46XBR4 and was astonished by everything it presented including the price.  It continues to work well; however, it was over $700 more than a comparable Samsung.The folks from Amazon arranged delivery (addressed below) and I set it up.  Now that's a feat.  But it was easy.  What made it such a pleasure was not having to tweek all that could be tweeked.  Many of the factory defaults were left the same.  I only had to change the brightness marker to accomodate a darkened room.  All factores considered this is a superlative TV for an honestly good price.  The touch of color could be considered a waste.  Who cares?  The speakers are adequate.  The 120hz refresh is a positive factor especially for Olympic coverage.  We'll probably wear out the remote changing channels to follow all that is going on in Beijing and did you hear football is on the way.  There is little as impressive as watching the sweat drip from a lineman's nose before the next play.I would buy it again in a heartbeat.The DeliveryThis is just the beginning of a much longer review.  A few minutes ago Amazon's White Glove delievered the TV.  It is difficult to praise the delivery process sufficiently.  From the phone call to set the delivery date and time to the actual delivery this was a perfect transaction.  The young man brought the TV in the house, removed it from the box, set it on the dresser, hooked it up, tested the channels and it was perfect.  Hooray for DeHaven Transportation and Amazon.TV's First BlushOut of the box with no calibration or fine tuning this TV was good enough not to worry about the fine tuning.  Some tweekers such as I will tweek just to have something to do but it is almost perfect.  I'll tweek it and then after a few days of viewing I'll give more information about the specifics.  I doubt if I'll find problems but who knows.", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "My 4th Samsung flat-panel", "Author": "DBroncos 4 Life", "ReviewID": "RB7RU10ABJT5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsung 40a650 on December 9 from Amazon for my bedroom. It has been a little over a month and these are my initial impressions.I should start out by saying that this is the fourth Samsung flat-panel I have bought in maybe 3 years. I used to be an LCD guy when I initially bought the Samsung LNS3251D as my first HDTV. I then bought the Samsung 5084 plasma. That set changed me into a plasma guy. It has spoiled me and I love everything about it. So I will do something a little different and compare the Samsung LCD 40a650 to the Samsung plasma 5084.The Sammy 40a650 is an excellent LCD for the price. All the praise you have read about it is accurate. I have to say that the black levels on the newer generation LCDs are getting very close to plasma quality('cept maybe the Pioneer Elite models). I watched \"The Descent\" on blu-ray via PS3 and it handled the dark-as-can-be cave scenes really well. You could make out details and faces pretty well without sacrificing black levels. It did as good a job as the plasma with the same material. This set gets an A+ for black levels. Outstanding!I also notice that most decent HDTVs you see in the store can show a great picture when the scene is static. It's when there is fast-motion (like explosions, car chases, football in the air, etc.) that you really separate the sets from each other. This set comes very close to the plasma set in dealing with fast-motion scenes. The 4ms response time is a big improvement over the 8ms and 10ms times in the older models. There is some motion blur, but that is limited to only the most demanding scenes. I am very sensitive to blurring, so your experience may vary. The plasmas by nature are absent of all motion blur and that is partly the reason I like them better. Anyway, I give it an A- here.Now on to color accuracy. Once again I compared this set to the plasma using a blu-ray version of \"The Fall.\" I found the colors to be close, but not quite as accurate as the plasma set. This movie is great to compare colors on sets by the way. I just felt that the plasma could deliver slightly more distinct color than this LCD. It could very well be calibration, but I did my best. Its not a deal breaker or anything, I just prefer the richer colors that I feel the plasma can provide over the LCD. Still, I think for most it will more than suffice. Probably solid B+ here.There is a multitude of settings to tweak the picture and I really like that about the Samsungs. Panasonics are great sets, but I have found there are less ways to tweak the picture on those than the Sammys. Check out AVSFORUMS for other peoples' settings and go from there. Set gets an A+ for \"tweakability.\"I will say that it is much lighter than a similar size plasma and that is the whole reason I went LCD over my beloved plasma sets. I originally wanted the 850 because it is super thin and much lighter than even the 650.  I just couldn't get myself to pay more for just those two pros when the picture on the 850 and 650 are identical.In closing, I calibrated both the plasma and LCD using a basic calibration disc and my own two eyes so again YMMV. The above is just my opinion based on basically comparing apples(plasmas) to oranges(LCDs). Well maybe oranges to tangerines.Good Luck all", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "A note on screen reflectivity", "Author": "Anthony M.

It looks great off or on.I spent a lot of time reading purchaser reviews of this product on this site and others before I bought it. I also went to a physical store to do a little direct evaluation of my own. Now that I have it set up and working for a couple of weeks I can tell you that I am not disappointed. The picture is beautiful, the User Manual and On-screen Menu are straightforward and easy to follow.In particular, I love the sharpness of the picture and the beautiful color. I did do a little bit of adjusting to get it the way I thought it should be, but that is normal.On the negative side I have only minor issues. The speakers, while not too bad, are really not good enough for my liking. After I get past the shock of the initial cost, I will buy a compatible surround sound unit to bolster the sound. Also, there is a setting in the Sound Menu called TruSurroundXT that is supposed to simulate surround sound with only two speakers. While this does not really simulate surround sound, it does improve the sound by increasing the depth of the sound a bit. Unfortunately, this can only be set to On for the time the TV is on- it resets to Off when you turn off the TV and you have to reset it again when you turn it back on. I have written to Samsung support about this twice but have not heard anything at all from them about a way to keep this on. Is Samsung's support system lacking? Even an acknowledgement of receipt of the support request would be nice. We'll see.The White Glove delivery service was a little confused and confusing at first as the driver and the dispatcher seemed to work independently and in conflict I was called by the dispatcher to schedule an appointment after the driver had already done so. When I called to check before the delivery, the dispatcher knew nothing about it and no delivery was scheduled nor did one arrive. To their credit, the dispatcher scheduled a delivery for me ASAP and all then went very smoothly. Really, a small glitch, but somewhat frustrating at the time.I would definitely recommend this set to anyone.P.S. I received an email reply to my second support query today that advised me to call in to talk to a technician about the TruSurroundXT problem I described above. The first tech tried but had to send me upstairs to a second level tech. I was told here that I am in need of a firmware update to correct this problem. To their credit- they are sending me, free of charge, a thumb drive with the update that I can plug into the TV. The only problems I have remaining about this is that 1) they seem to have ignored my first email, 2) they have no information about this on the web support site, although other firmware updates are listed. Since this has been a known problem for a few weeks, I would have been saved a fair amount of searching, etc. if I had seen this announced and then known what do do.In all, this is not a big problem and they are handling it well enough.

TV", "Author": "Kelly", "ReviewID": "R1FAU35RHZWJJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A few weeks back, I decided it was time to replace my 12 year old Sony TV and 17 year old \"stereo\" system with its two cheap speakers.End result, after lots of research, was the purchase of the following, all from Amazon.- Samsung LN40A650 LCD TV- Onkyo TX-SR606- JBL CS6100 6-Piece Home Cinema Speaker Package- Logitech Harmony 550 Universal RemoteAlso connected are;- Scientific Atlanta cable set top box from Time Warner- Sony SLV-D300P DVD/VCR which is 2-3 years old- Nintendo Game CubeInstallation was in a 20'x30' room.My goals were to have a high quality TV with decent sound, and keep the entire cost under $2500 if at all possible. Goal achieved, even with the purchase of the incidentals; some speaker wire, banana clips for speaker cables, an optical digital audio, cable, etc.My concerns prior to the purchase;- Would the 40 inch TV be large enough? Yes it is even though most of the viewing is across almost all of the 30\" length of the room. While the 46\" version would have worked as well, neither initially, nor at any time in the four weeks I've had this running have I found myself wishing I had the larger screen. My other concern with the 600 series was the glossy screen. Where my old CRT was, I always had glare from outside during the same and from a lamp at night... the LCD is mounted in a different place, but even so, it's virtually impossible to find glare on this screen when it's on. I have to view the screen from about a 75 degree angle from the side to find reflections... very pleased with how this worked out.- I had read some disparaging things in the forums about the CEVA shipping company who would deliver the TV. CEVA was perfect. The TV arrived sooner than I expected (Reno where they ship from to Orange County). CEVA called on a Friday, confirmed that they could deliver any time the next week. They showed up about 0930 on Monday, right at the time they said they would. The shipping carton and contents were in perfect condition. Delivery people offered to unpack and help with taking out of the box... phone contact and delivery staff, all professional.  I couldn't can't ask more of a shipping company.- Even with all my research, I kept hoping that I'd find no connection and set up surprises with the Onkyo. Setup was painless although. My only \"had to read the book\" was because the older Sony DVD/VCR combo has separate outputs for both the DVD and the VCR.. I wound up using digital audio out and S-video for the DVD side and composite video/audio for the VCR.- Speakers... even if you go to all of the places you can visit to hear speakers, you have no idea how they will actually sound in your own environment. And, speakers are an object thing. My concerns here were that the only review I could find was for the smaller CS480 speakers. the CD480s have a single woofer and tweeter in satellites vs. the dual woofers in the CS6100 package. The reviews of the CD480s indicated that they were a bit bright, a bit lacking in mid-range under some conditions. I don't find that to be the case with the CS6100s, maybe because of the dual woofers.I selected the TV because I already owned a 32\" Samsung purchased last Christmas, and am still VERY happy with it. And a friend whose opinions I trust had just purchased the LN4A650. The 4ms response time and 120Hz refresh rate were also part of the decision to go with a 6 series vs. a 5 series... my only concern was the glossy display and that turned out to be a complete non-issue. The display is amazing, the Olympics really show off how good sports can look... the colors in the CSI and CSI Miami series really show you how much attention the people making TV have adapted to HD production.. sound is OK if you don't have a large room and done have a receiver.I selected the Onkyo SR606 for a variety of reasons.- Four HDMI inputs- One HDMI output (there are only two cables to my TV; power and HDMI.. a nice, neat, almost wireless setup)- Sufficient other inputs to deal with anything I have and might buy, including a plugging in a yet to be purchase Apple Universal Dock for i-Pods and i-Phones- The Onkyo can \"upscale\" all non-HDMI video input to 1080i... no need to buy a separate DVD `up-convert' box for the older Sony DVD player. The Onkyo does a nice job of up scaling older DVD movies and the graphics from the Game Cube are excellent. Pleasant surprises... the Onkyo senses audio source from the cable box... example, if the TV program is broadcast in HD with 5.1 audio, the Onkyo passes the 1080i from the cable box straight through, and automatically sets the audio settings to use the 5.1 source. Switch channels to a channel with only stereo and the Onkyo switched to \"TV Logic\"... you can manually override any of these settings (quickly from the Logitech remote), but i find little reason to do so. Another nice surprise... I often watch TV after the rest of the household has gone to bed. Many movies, some TV and even some commercials are delivered with 5.1 sound. And when the satellite speakers kick in with the sound effects or music score, the volume in the room goes up enough to wake people. The Onkyo has two \"Night Mode\" settings which soften the higher volume sound affects and music scores either a little bit, or quite a bit. Result is, you can pick a sound level which is high enough to hear dialogue, and not have to dive for the remote when music or sound effects kick in.[...]Advice.Dealing with four remotes is a pain... all four of my remotes, Time Warner, Samsung, Onkyo and Sony... claim to be \"universal\" and to some extent and with significant limitations, they are. The $75 I paid for the Logitech remote is some of the best money I've ever spent.HDMI cables... DON'T buy them at your local superbox stereo/appliance/computer/sound store. They all charge $75-$150 for cables you can buy at places like [...] for $20-$25 dollars. For the most part, and with a few limitations, HDMI is HDMI is HDMI... that fancy $250 HDMI cable is no better than a well built $25 cable.Speaker wire connections. If you speakers and/or your receiver support the use of \"banana clips\", use them. Blue Jeans cable carries them, and if you buy HDMI cable from them, a good buy. But you can probably find these locally for not much more if they are all you need and avoid the shipping cost.It all came together and works the way I wanted it to... I'd do this combination again in a heartbeat.

The reviews said the overall picture quality was very, very good. We agree. The picture is stunning in high definition and very good in standard definition. We don't have a blu-ray player but regular dvd's render well. Blacks are quite black and colors are both realistic and vibrant.2. The screen is large enough to fill a good-sized room, with people sitting at least 10 feet away, but is small enough to be watched from the floor. We visited stores to see the sizes in person.3. The base swivels. The A650 swivels. It appears the A750 doesn't and only adds marginally useful things like some pre-loaded content. The A850 is thinner, but our tv sits on a low table near a wall and is certainly thin enough. The A950 is LED and is much more expensive.Comments:1. The Samsung website has a live chat feature. The TV comes with a chime that plays when it turns on and off. The instructions for turning that off are buried in the manual but the live chat person quickly sent me a link to the online FAQ.2. The remote has some useful shortcuts. On some standard def channels, a program may run with lines at the top. While you can move the picture up or down somewhat, these lines will likely not go away. You can hit the \"p.size\" button and switch from \"scan\" to 16:9 and the lines disappear. When you change channels, the tv goes back to scan.3. For me, the 120hz motion feature works best in low or perhaps medium setting. It interpolates frames and in certain sports that make the action look oddly sped up, as though the legs are moving too fast and then slowing down. This is really more a matter of how the cameras and the broadcast works than the TV but this is how the TV compensates. The effect to me is worse with basketball. If the effect is too high, the constant refocusing of your eyes and cause a headache or make you queasy. Turn the effect down and the problem largely goes away. The broadcasts simply aren't able to deliver seamless high-def motion in constant focus .... yet.4. When you're setting up the tv, the documentation doesn't adequately tell you how to select the right source to connect to your cable, dvd, etc. Press the \"source\" button on the remote.

Amazon free shipping delivered in under a week to my CA address. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. SD TV looks only okay, but that's to be expected.

(Through cheapo HDMI cables found on Amazon - forget the $50 ones they push in stores) Razor sharp definition. I'm glad I spent the extra bucks to get the 50,000:1 contrast model over the cheaper 30,000:1. Blacks appear deep and dark - a significant improvement over my old 42\" 720 LG model.

Until I can splurge on a machine, regular DVDs on a regular (ie: non-upconverting) DVD player look good. Not HD quality, but definitely not unwatchable - which I feared they might be. My Xbox 360 looks stupidly good. Plugged in Forza racing game and the picture blew me away. Animation is perfect - no artifacts or blurring.I'm on the fence with the 120Hz feature. Watched HD tennis and the ball looks like Haley's comet with or without 120Hz. Maybe there's a subtle improvement, but IMHO don't base your decision on this alone. The bezel concerned me, especially since I have windows along one side of my living room 5' from the TV. I needn't have worried - the \"touch of red\" is subtle. Not the neon red one posted pic seemed to portray. It only really appears towards the outside edges of the bezel and is a kind of dark cherry red. It compliments my natural wooden TV console. The absolute edge is clear, which gives the TV a very classy, distinct look, which sets it apart from all the other TVs out there. But if you just HAVE to have everything black, maybe go for a different model.Sound is good enough for a small space. Even my games have plenty of clear volume. Until I invest in surround sound, it's more than adequate. Not tinny or harsh.FYI: the pedestal is 24\"x12 1/2\". (I couldn't find this info and was concerned the thing would be too big for my small console). I thought the oval shape would look odd, being used to rectangular bases, but it is very sleek and IMO draws less attention to itself being that shape. Good if you can't/won't mount the set.PROS:Superb HD picture.Sleek, attractive design.Deep blacks.Good sound.Good preset picture modes (Sports, Game, Cinema, Standard)Picture size - yes, you can stretch-to-fit (good for broadcasts or older movies which don't monopolize all that beautiful LCD landscape)CONS:Takes about 15sec to start up. (even my 17yr old Volvo starts faster than that!)Changing video source (eg: from DVD to TV) takes 5-7 seconds (not the end of the world, but could be faster, surely)Picture-in-Picture only works with analog TV signal (if you have cable or satellite, which you will have for an LCD - duh - it's useless. Plus, PIP will be redundant in 2009 when all broadcasts go digital)Remote - yes, it's not great. But you don't have to use the track wheel at all. Problem solved.SUMMARY: The cons are so minor, they can't lower my experience of this TV. I don't need the TV to turn on within a second. My life's not THAT busy. Same for switching video source. Changing channels, by the way, is as fast as my old tube TV, and faster than my old LG LCD. If you've spent hours toying over this decision, just buy it. I love this thing. I've spent hours and hours in front of it and I've only had it a week. My only regret - I wish they'd dropped the price on the 46\" model 2 weeks ago.

The picture is breath-taking and the AMP is awesome.  The thing I don't love about it however is the sound.  I've been having audio issues with it.

I've tried everything thinking maybe it was some other source such as my DVD player or stereo but it happens when I watch broadcast TV also.  In addition to that, the tv came up scrambled when the TV was turned on at one point and didn't right itself until it was turned off and then back on.  So, at this point, I'm checking to see if I can exchange it as perhaps this is a lemon.I'm still rating this TV 4 stars as it does have an exceptional picture and although the sound is not the best, since the speakers are pointing backwards, it does have a custom audio option which greatly improves the sound.

The picture is wonderful.  Blacks are extremely improved over my HDTV of 2 gens ago.  There are tons of options (and I haven't even been into the super technical menu you have to boot into) to adjust the picture to your liking.  It shipped quickly and Amazon had the best price around and did the 30 day price match (dropped $65 in those 30 days) without complaint.The only small annoyance I have found is that the TV will not pass 5.1 sound from HDMI inputs out of its optical output.  It will give you 5.1 from the antenna/cable, but will not pass 5.1 (reverts to stereo) from anything else plugged in via HDMI.  This seems to largely defeat the purpose of HDMI carrying both video and audio.  So the only option you are left with is to: A. buy a HDMI receiver, which negates the benefit of having 4 HDMI ports on your TV, or B. Buy a whole bunch of ridcoulus wires and splitters and whatnot to send the video via HDMI to your TV and the Audio via optical or another HDMI to your current receiver.  I am slightly buggered on that point, but I have read that it has something to do with the movie industry lobbying to have it that way for some odd reason, and it is not, technically, Samsungs fault.  Still, it detracts from the experience for those of us who have older/simpler receivers without HDMI inputs, and for those of use that do, makes the four HDMI ports somewhat of a \"Why am I paying for these?\" quandary.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Stephen B.

It produces the best picture on the market, IMO.  120hz is only useful if you have Blu-Ray.  If you do not have Blu-Ray, then you'd be better off buying a standard 1080p TV.  For those who have Blu-Ray, the 4ms response time and 50,000:1 contrast ratio are unrivaled.  The only other TV that comes close is the LG Scarlet, which I find bulky and odd-looking, but which does offer more input/output options.  The sound is really quite remarkable for standard TV sound.  I don't use the TV sound, though, as I run everything through home theater.  All the other reviews about picture quality are dead-on.  The clarity, sharpness, color depth, and resolution are unbelievable.  The only fault I find with this TV is the glossy finish.  The high gloss screen coating can catch a pretty good glare.

The picture on all three of those things look insane.  Truly a terrific TV, especially for what you pay.  Here are some of the concerns that I had before I bought the TV and what I think about them now:Picture: This TV creates the most realistic picture I have ever seen.  Standard Def. cable looks great on the TV also.  You can customize the TV with every picture option you could ever imagine.  You have absolutely nothing to worry about when it comes to the picture.120hz: This makes my video games look great and creates a truly unique look to the video game.  I leave it off during movies because I just don't like the way it makes them look; just a personal preference.  But, 120hz is something that you will actually notice.  It also has a high, medium and low setting, which is nice.Touch of Color: Unless you really do not like red, then you will have no problem with this.  I was very worried about the way it would look, and now I actually like it.  It's really not that noticeable unless it is in bright light (it still looks good in bright light).Glossy Screen: I was really worried about this because of glare, but I rarely notice any glare on the screen.  I have three windows in the room with this TV; I have to close the blinds, but even on a bright day, you won't notice too much of a glare.Glossy Finish: The TV does attract some dust, but it really is not very bad.  I wipe mine down about once a week.  They give you a cloth with the TV for wiping it down.Overall: It's a 100% definate, buy it.  You will not find another TV at this price level with everything that you get.

The default settings work for a great picture quality for both HD and analog channels. However I changed the energy saving from Off to Medium and adjusted the contrast, brightness, color and flesh tone settings a little to bring out a truly mind blowing picture, and this was for an international channel for which there's no HD available. So you can imagine the absolute gold quality picture I get for the HD channels. Worth every penny I spent on this set! The burgundy bezel goes great with my chocolate colored entertainment center. Looks like it all came as one custom designed package. Actually the bezel color was also a factor for me going for this model. Glad I did! The jog dial takes a little getting used to but once you do it's 100 times easier to use than pushing buttons. Just like using your iPod. I read some reviews about the panel attracting dust but in the past week I haven't seen it attract any more than my Sony so may be it just depends on where you keep the TV. Either way, it's a minor concern for the kind of technology and aesthetics you are paying for :) Before I purchased I spoke to Samsung customer care via their on line chat support to clarify some technical details and I must say I'm very impressed with their support team, so that's a big plus also when putting in this kind of money for a TV.

I almost went with Best Buys LNT4066F, I almost went with LNT4071, and I was SUPER close to purchasing an LNT4081 and after seeing a very detailed review on the 4081 I was turned off by it and went to the drawing board. This had the contrast ratio that was up there, this had MORE inputs, this had the affordability too. This was too good to pass up.Let's start with the inputs. I'm loving the 4 HDMI ports. I actually don't have all of them used at the moment, but it's pretty nice to know I have an extra one. Currently I have a Sony Playstation 3, an Xbox 360 Halo Edition, and a Panasonic 1080p Upscaling DVD player hooked on it via HDMI. I currently have my Comcast HD Box hooked up to the TV via Component cables. That only leaves me with 1 more Component cable slot and that'll put me at a stand still. I'll either have to use that last slot for my Wii or use it for my PSP. So It seems whenever I would need to switch between the PSP and the Wii it would be a slight hassle to unplug/replug, but that's fine. It's not a major issue, but I'm noting it in case anyone else has an absurd amount of systems like I do.The Touch of Color is a neat feature. I'm an Auburn fan, but this TV seems to have Georgia colors. I guess I'll deal with that. Hah.Picture Quality is fantastic. However, I must say I'm not quite fond of some of the visual modes. Dynamic seems to make the picture brighter, but not as smooth. Edges are somewhat sharp. I've pretty much kept mine on Cinema view for a majority of my viewings even tho the color seems a tad washed out and yellowed when in Cinema view. I haven't fully experimented with any of the detailed settings when it comes to contrast and backlight and brightness and what not. HD quality is really good though if it's set on cinema. I know I tried watching CSI Miami on OnDemand and in \"Standard\" video mode and there was some choppy issues going on. I switched to Cinema mode and it looked MUCH better than Standard. Now if I can just get Cinema mode to look more vibrant then I'll be truly happy. Like I said before.. Cinema's good and works great, but is a tad bit more dim/washed out. As far as gaming goes, Devil May Cry 4 works best on Cinema mode and not gaming mode. Gaming mode makes it look edgy while Cinema smooths it out. Grand Theft Auto 4 looks FANTASTiC. Playing a PS2 game, via PS3, I played Xenosaga 3 and that actually works best when viewed in Gaming Mode. Same goes for Guilty Gear X Accent Core. It seems with games you'll have to toggle and tinker the settings that makes it look best for you. It's unfortunate one setting couldn't do it, but I guess i'm too demanding.120Hz AutoMotion. I'm unsure if this is a blessing or not. My sister caught it before I did, but I'll go ahead and mention it. When watching Transformers (Upscaled DVD) and when watching Stealth (Blu-Ray via PS3) we noticed that the scenes were rather.. fast. The sound matched the voices perfectly, but visually you could almost sense like the video was hurried. It's quite hard to explain. I was also watching a Digital non HD version of \"A Murder of Crows\" on TV one morning and noticed that the fast motioned movements of Cuba Gooding Jr. went away when turning Automotion OFF. It's almost as if I would prefer to have it OFF than On (or rather on Low). However I haven't experienced an HD Sports game yet, so maybe it might be a good thing.Downside of the set is the sound. It's not terribly bad, but it would probably be recommended to have surround sound for the ultimate experience. Not a biggie. Another downside would be that it's a dust magnet, but it's nothing a little cleaning every weekend couldn't fix. The wheel on the remote needs some care when using. I've passed some of the settings I wanted to access accidentally. Not terribly bad tho, but worth mentioning.All in all, I love the TV. It still requires some tinkering with the settings, but I'm satisfied. Oh and one more thing I must mentioned. I'm not sure if it's just MY tv or if it's a cooling issue or what not, but when turning the TV off and having complete silence. The TV makes faint sound. Like metal that's being cooled and it has a certain kinda wire twang sound thing going on. I hope it's not too much of a trouble. I'll be monitoring that sound VERY much so within the next 30 days.Lastly, the TV was shipped on a Monday, Amazon said it would get there the Wednesday of the following week it shipped and it actually arrived on Friday. Blessing to have my TV during the weekend instead of.. well today!Hope this review helps.

Additionally, the difference between the 60Hz and 120Hz was striking. Fast action is incredibly clear and scrolling text is readable.

Wessling \"Wiley Retired Prof\"", "ReviewID": "ROCPS42JLESLW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I researched the market for HDTVs for over 2 years before the price got to where I was willing to invest. The options I finally had to decide between were the Samsung 650 series and the Sony Z series. When I looked at the Samsung next to the Sony W series, the clarity and contrast (blackness of the background)of the Samsung looked better to both my wife and I. We were not able to compare the Sony Z series side by side with the Samsung 650, but the deciding factor ended up PRICE. We were able to get the Samsung 40\" 650 Series for $450 less than the best price I found for the Sony Z. We also saved at least that much by buying the TV from Amazon.com versus Best Buy or HH Gregg.Pros: Amazon.com had a very competitive price and I felt safer getting a HDTV through the most reliable of the online vendors especially since my wife was very wary of buying on line. I opted to get Super Saver Shipping and that took about a week to arrive. The TV had no damage out of the box and worked just fine. AFTER I hooked up my HDTV antenna, I was extremely pleased with the picture quality. In Augusta GA, we are able to get all of the networks ABC, CBS, NBC, & FOX plus SC PBS with strong clear HDTV reception. No need to pay for Digital and HDTV upcharges from cable or satellite providers. The remote and on screen menus are pretty intuitive once you get started and it is easy to control the channel programming and selection.Cons: The local shipping company said that I would be getting \"white glove service\", but that was not the case. The driver was alone and would not let me help him carry the TV until he got it to the front door. Not only did he not offer to participate is set up other than helping get the TV uncrated and onto my TV table, but he was extremely impatient to leave when I was hooking up the HDMI from my DVD, the Optical digital sound to my Home theater system and plugging the set in. This took less than 10 minutes since I had already set up all of the hook up except the TV before he arrived. I did not have my HDTV antenna hooked up yet as I had one more cable that had not been delivered. The Picture was POOR (less clear than our late 1980s Panasonic 27\" CRT Monitor) as others have shared when the TV is hooked up to an analog cable signal. Initially, I was mislead by a misprint on Amazon.com web site that said there was a $200 cash rebate which was really a $200 credit toward \"Sports Memorabilia\". When I inquired about this to Amazon, they politely acknowledged that there had been an error in the description of the rebate for a short time, but that they could not give a cash rebate at the price I paid. I was disappointed, but felt it was an honest mistake and not a ploy to entice the sale.Plus or minus: I have not been impressed with the functionality of the 120 Hz Motion smoothing feature on the Samsung. I have tried it on the low and medium settings while viewing HDTV football games. I still see blurring around the heads of players between them and the background. I believe that what it provides is significantly better than the older LCDs that had major ghost blurring issues, but Plasma still is the only way to really have smooth motion. That is probably why other reviewers who have had Plasma HDTVs have complained the Samsung 120 Hz does not compare to the lack of blurring on Plasma sets. I can live with the slight bluring, since I am unwilling to double the energy consumption just to have a less blurred football action.Summary: I've had the HDTV for a little over 2 weeks and am very pleased with the improvement in picture quality and abillity to get free HDTV off air programming with an antenna.

In fact, they did not bring any tools with them.They explained in broken English that they needed parts and gave me a piece of paper to sign that said \"motherboard\" on it.That they came without tools makes me believe they did not expect to fix it or even open it diagnose a problem.

I went to a local Circuit City and was prepared to buy last years Samsung 40inch model because of the good deal. When I got there it was right next to the LN46A650 (46inch version of this TV). I was amazed at how much better the picture looked on 650 not only compared to that TV, but the whole wall of TV's for that matter. The only reason why I didn't buy it at that moment was because it was out of my price range (priced $1999). I went home and did some research and found it came in a 40 inch. I decided then and there that I was going to get this TV.Amazon had a great price, but I was worried about buying a TV online, so I went to Best Buy who carried the lN40650 to see if they would price match. They said they'd meet me half way (1599), but that was still too much especially since I'd be paying another $100 for tax. The price was just too good so I went ahead and ordered from Amazon. You can't go wrong with their 30-day price match and of course no tax or shipping. I am so pleased with my purchase. The only negative is that I can't control the TV with my Comcast Cable remote. Also Picture-In-Picutre is useless if you have a cable box. If you are worrying about buying a TV online don't, Amazon has been great. I didn't actually have my TV delivered because I wasn't available during their delivery times, so I went to their location and picked up the TV myself.

Way too much time. I'm embarassed to admit the number of hours I put into my search. Because I'm cheap, I looked at some lower-end TVs (Vizio, Phillips, Toshiba, etc.) hoping to save a few bucks. After seeing the picture quality of those sets, I figured I'd spend the money to get a better one.While out shopping one day, the Samsung 550 series caught my eye. I was really impressed with the picture quality and decided to go online to do a little more research. When I saw the 650 series was out, I knew I had to see it for myself. So, I searched some more and went to a few places that had it in stock. Seeing it in person was more than enough for me. The image was crystal clear. The bezel was gorgeous. The sound was marginal (then again, I was getting it to look at, more than to listen to).One store had it next to the Sony XBR model. I'll be honest, I think the XBR had a slightly better picture. The XBR definitely had better sound. However, the $1,000 higher price tag at the store (about a $500 difference at Amazon) just wasn't worth it. The XBR was better, but just by the smallest of factors. So, the Samsung was definitely the right choice for me and my budget.After seeing the price at Amazon for $1556, I couldn't buy it fast enough. A lot of people have shared horror stories about CEVA, but I didn't have any issues. They called me the day that it came to their warehouse and scheduled a delivery date. Since they couldn't deliver it for 3 more working days, I asked if I could come pick it up. \"No problem,\" they said. The warehouse was only a dozen miles or so away, so I went and got it that night. Everyone was really friendly and helpful. They loaded it right into my car and I was on my way.I have the TV in a fairly well-lit room and I don't think the glare is all that bad off the shiny surface. I was worried about it initially, but I don't think it's that big of a deal. Then again, we haven't had a super-sunny day, yet. The remote is a little awkward with the click-wheel feature, but I run everything through my Comcast cable remote. So, I'm really just using it to tweak the picture.Here's what it all comes down to: this is an outstanding television. The picture is phenomenal. The sound is adequate.

Firstly, I think the Sony XBR series sets and the Pioneer Elite series have the better picture, but it comes at a large jump in price.  At the time this set was purchased at Amazon.com, the price was $1299.00 and represented one of the lowest prices you could find; there are other places that were less expensive, but for the price difference of $100.00 or so, I'd rather spend my money on a sure thing that Amazon.com represents.The picture is very clear and the adjustments to the picture quality are available, though the menu for set makes you jump thru several screens to get there; once there, the adjustments are easy enough to do.  I found the set to be too bright when set at the default settings, so I turned the brightness down to 40.The red touch of colour seems to make the set stand out; yet, that isn't what I complain about this set.  The piano black bezel seems to attract dust like nothing I've ever seen, it is necessary for me to clean the bezel several times a week to keep it clean.The standard speakers are something of a surprise; they sound a lot better than I thought that they would, so if you're not into surround sound or home theater, it ought to be good enough.  I have the set hooked up to a Yamaha 5.1 receiver, with Polk frnt speakers, Klipsch center speakers and Onkyo rears with a B&W; sub for watching certain movies; though most of time I use either the tv speakers or just the front Polk's to listen to.The 120 Hz feature does make a difference in high action scenes, but even with normal movement it does sharpen the picture and is not a distraction, so I leave it on.If you must have the best picture, then this is not the set for you; having said that, you will have to make a large jump in price in order to get a better picture.

We have a Panasonic DMP BD35K blu-ray disc player and the few movies we've watched, both blu-ray and standard, have looked great.Other info:We have found that keeping the 120 hz option on works well for all programming, especially sports programs, but do turn it off for blu-ray discs.The TV sound is a bit tinny but we have a home theatre speaker system hooked up to the TV that we use for movies, and we also change the TV sound settings in the menu from standard to other options to make voices sound fuller and richer.We find no problem with operating the remote as we ignore the wheel option and use all buttons.Because the HD cable box we rented from our cable company was not calibrated correctly for our TV, it took a few days and a number of phone calls to the cable company (the name starts with C) to find a rep who would agree to tell us how to change the cable box settings at home rather than pay for a service call as the first few reps insisted on. Once we changed the picture setting to widescreen and the resolution to 1080, we started getting the amazing picture quality we saw in stores.Two minor disappointments:We have a Nintendo Wii system and have found that some of the games on the sports disc look a little jagged around the edges. We purchased a Wii HD Link Compnent Cable from Amazon but that has not eliminated the jaggies.To use the TV screen to show digital camera images, we hooked up our Apple PowerBook G4 15\" monitor computer to the TV with a DVI to HDMI cable, following the manual directions, but that did not work. After much digging for info on the Samsung web site, we discovered that our TV supports an Apple PowerBook G4 12\" monitor computer, but not a 15\" monitor computer. We have since switched to a flash drive which allows us to put images on the TV screen and access the options provided.All in all, we are very happy we purchased this TV.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Nice TV - 120Hz is interesting", "Author": "Richard Morris \"Danbo\"", "ReviewID": "R2QBAB0IJCQFQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, Amazon's white glove delivery service is fantastic.

He was nice, and helped me to connect my cable box (didn't really take much with the HDMI cable).Anyways, on to the TV.  The image is very customizable and I have never seen such a crisp display on a set this size.  When I previewed the set in the store, I was immediately drawn to it because, save some 3k+ sets, it was the highest video quality in the store.On to explaining my title: 120 Hz mode kind of makes standard definition video look as if all editing was removed.  It makes video quality look better, but in an interesting way.  By simulating half frames, it creates a very pop-out look to moving characters.  There is no easy way to explain it, but I actually like the feature.Anyways, I totally recommend this TV as it has all the top of the line features at a reasonable price.", "Date": "December 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "A Home Run!", "Author": "Wilee D", "ReviewID": "R4BHJGZR576W7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For my first flat screen tv, I researched for months, and Samsung consistently came out on top.

What I want to point out is the 650 series vs the 630 series. I was settled on the 630 series due to fear of excessive glare from the 650 (many reviewers warn on this). At a local store, I viewed the 630 and 650 side by side and there was a noticable difference in picture quality; the 650 was better (deeper blacks, etc). I got the 650. My living room has several windows and there is a patio door in the connecting kitchen that faces the tv. I've watched tv and bluray in both daylight and night. Glare is absolutely not a problem. I worried for no reason. Glare-wise, it's no different (maybe better) than any other tv I've had over the years. It's a great tv with great features.  And what a picture - yikes!

So far th tv is everythign we expected it to be. The set up was very easy and within 20 min of having it out of the box it was up and working. I have noticed on some instances where the picture is blurry but nothing to serious in that regards. The one time it was bad was off road racing and i think the combination of many browns and the ripples on the track was to much for it to comprehend, no biggie for me as i dont watch alot of that stuff anyway. Sporting events are simply put, outstanding. I havent had any problems like some of the other reviewers. I found the remote was pretty easy to figure out and navigating wasnt that bad either. The wheel wasnt no big deal for me, heck i thought the owners manual was the most complicated part of any of it. I looked for about 3 months before i bought this through Amazon, i looked and looked locally, on internet and anywhere else i could for a cheaper price but never did find one. With the no intrest for 24 months and free shipping, you cant go wrong. I even got a refund when the price decreased, it pays to check back daily. Delivery wasnt a problem either, they said between noon and 2 and showed up about little after 2. They brought it in to the house opened it up made sure there was no damage and away they went, no complaints there. i guess what sealed the purchase for me was when i went to  Best Buy and  the Sony was on the left and LG was on the right and Samsung was in the middle and of all the samsung had the brightest and clearest picture, plus there price was about thousand more than Amazon.

I came to purchase this TV through Amazon. I purchased it through here because I got it cheaper than I could find anywhere else and with free white glove delivery.  I was in all honesty a bit skeptical about the delivery service at the time, but they showed up when scheduled to and helped me take the TV out of the box and place it where it needed to be.  They also took the box away for me.Picture quality:Full HD is 1080p, which is this TV's native resolution.  And let me tell you, the quality of the picture is obvious even for someone who does not care much about it, or just doesn't know much about it.  My Dad was instantly impressed when he came to visit me (and he isn't one for technology).  Also, the contrast ratio on this TV is just about as good as it gets without going to Plasma or the LCD technology which is backlit by LED's (but this is not popular at all).  With the contrast ratio at 50,000:1 the blacks truly seem black and the color variance is something truly to behold.What some people might consider cons, but I consider pros:First of let's start with the \"touch of color.\"  What this does is create a clean, smooth finish infused with a hint of a translucent red around the edge of the TV instead of the standard \"piano black.\"  I personally like the slight variance in color.  It gives a certain uniqueness with this specific design element that makes it stand out.  However, some people might prefer the smooth \"piano black\" finish.  What I recommend is going to a store and seeing the difference because no pictures online or in any magazine truly do it justice.The glossy screen is another thing that some people are not a fan of.  But, once again I like the appearance of it and after having viewed other TV's with the same contrast ratio and brightness, the glossy screen does seem to give the picture quality an edge.  The colors seemed to appear more vibrant as well as the blacks seeming more black.  However, I would not recommend putting this in a room that light is going to shine directly on it because there will be some screen glare.  So, just be aware of that.\"Auto Motion Plus 120Hz\" is something that I was not sure of even when purchasing this TV.  I would say that I went with this to \"future-proof\" my television.  All of the higher end LCD's have it now and it does definitely make a difference.  It really does smooth out the image but it looks like something you have never seen before.  It gives it an almost exactly true to life image.  Some people refer to it as almost 3D.  It is very good for watching sports.  But, I'm not a huge fan of it for regular television or movies (I keep it set to low for these).  This is once again one of those things that I would recommend trying in the store to see how you feel about.The one thing on this TV that many people say is lacking is the speakers, and while I do agree they are not audiophile quality, they sound like any other TV speakers.  If this is a big deal to you, I would check out the LN40A750 as it has a built in subwoofer to enhance sound quality.  But, if you really want truly good sound, you must dish out the money for a home entertainment system with nice speakers.

Imagine my surprise when I received an email on July 31st asking me to call to set up delivery. I set up the delivery for August 1nd. I made sure to ask if they would bring the TV upstairs since it was for my bedroom. The rep assured me that I had white glove service. They would take it where I wanted it, open the box, plug in the TV, put it on the stand, and remove the trash. They just won't do wall mounting.When the delivery guy came and I told him it was going upstairs. He said, \"You didn't tell them it had to go up steps.\" I told them I did, and exactly what the rep told me they would do. (I only have 6 steps to get upstairs. He was just being lazy.) He reluctantly took it upstairs. Then, he handed me the receipt to sign. I said, \"Aren't you going to put it on the dresser for me?\" He said they weren't allowed. Again, I told him the rep told me the only thing they don't do is wall mounting. He said this was considered wall mounting because the dresser was above hip level. I said, \"Well, how do you expect ME to get it up there?\" So he agreed to \"help\" me put it on the dresser.We got it up there. As he was walking away, he said, \"I could take the box, but you might want to keep it in case you need to return it. So, I figure that I received beige glove delivery :-) I got what they promised, but I had to force the guy to do what he was supposed to do. If you get a lazy delivery person, insist that they do their job!Now for the tv - This TV is amazing! Some people said they wouldn't get it do to the red color. I can't even see the red color. I guess that if you have it in a very bright room, you *might* see it. But it isn't lighted and it almost blends in with the tv.My only problem was turning on the tv believe it or not! I never read instructions and hadn't taken the remote out of the box. I felt all around the screen for a power button, per se. It took me a few minutes to realize that there is no \"button\", The power, channel, and volume are all touch sensitive controls right beside the lower, right side of the screen. It's almost impossible to find in the dark.The picture is super clear and the colors are vivid. I have great viewing whether sitting at my computer (3 feet away) or laying in bed (20 feet away). Although the picture was perfect out of the box, I've played with a few of the settings. So far, I've found that the pre-set viewing modes are very good as well. In about a month, I'll use my HD optimization DVD to see if it makes any differences.If this were my living room tv, I might need a surround sound system, but for bedroom use, the speakers are more than adequate.I have ordered a cord that is long enough for me to connect my computer.

With the 120Hz on and all settings set, you will have a great picture, even watching sports and all.Con:The remote is a bit sensitive, as works like an iPod. I also thought the alignment of the connections to the TV fram could have been better, as mind was not perfectly aligned, so it was difficult to put my HDMI cables perfectly into the slot. I didnt use the component cables, but noticed they wold need a tiny tweak as well. Hopefully they are not rushing these out to have poor quality arise later.Software update - my box came from Amazon with the Software update applied (said so right on the box). I also tested to make sure and no problems with blacking out or anything, like some may have reported. SO my tv was current.Side note: I also have a Panasonic TH-50PZ750U 50\" 1080p  (plasma TV), to which I compared my Samsung LCD to the Panasonic.

Initially I was looking at the older 5 series because it was on sales. But after checking tech details, I found out that there's a 6 series with better refresh rate (120Hz) and contrast (50,000:1) for only about $100 more. These specs are important for me because it's going to be watched by my 5 yr old daughter too and she has stigmatism with her eyes (condition her eyes get fatigue easily). There're also 6 & 7 series but specs are almost the same and, in my opinion, do not justify for higher prices in terms of my needs.I'm really happy about this TV as picture quality is really good. Sound quality is pretty good too. It's comparable to my amplifier with two sub woofers. My daughter is now enjoying her DVDs and kid programs without teary eyes or fatigue.Pros: Great picture quality and nice sound system. Color is crisp, motion response is fast and controls are intuitive. I also like the feature that automatically tunes to the digital channel over the air (like 5.1, 7.1, etc.) instead of analog channel when you press the main channel digits only. An older Sam Sung I have did not do that, so it was a bit annoying to press channel up to switch from analog to digital or press the sub-channels every time. This one solved that annoyance.Cons: Only minor grips that do not really matter. Screen is a little shiny and reflective but it's ok when not watched from an extreme angle like greater then 45 deg away from center. The controls on the TV are almost invisible because they're touch buttons flushed to the frame and markings are very hard to see (in case you need to use them like when you can't find the remote).

The blacks are black, the colors are vibrant, and the detail is crisp.I will mention a few cons (although I do give this TV five solid stars!): Power-up time. Clocking in at just under a ten second wait, my wife looked at me funny when she first pressed the power button and nothing happened. I told her that the red light blinks when its turning on. She asked why it takes so long. I honestly don't know, but I suppose all those 2 million pixels need a few seconds to warm up. This might be a ridiculous complaint, but for me ten seconds borders on unacceptable.Tuning time is my second gripe. Tuning analog channels takes only about 1 second. This is a bit long for a guy like me who is a professional channel surfer (I can scan through a dozen channels in a matter of seconds if the TV hardware will allow it--this set doesn't!). I can deal with ~1second tuning times for analog channels--no big deal. However, the tuning time for digital channels is at least two seconds. Bringing channel surfing to a frustrating crawl.Third, the remote control and/or TV's interface is slightly unresponsive/slow. With this remote/TV I need to slowly and deliberately press each button and wait for the TV to visually respond to my input before I press the next button.One positive that I can't leave out is how awesome these 1080p TVs are for Computer outputs! I hooked my wife's laptop up via HDMI and wished I had a wireless keyboard and mouse so I could sit on the sofa and surf the web on my new TV. the text was crisp like I never thought possible for a TV!

I looked at the 5 series in 46\" and compared it with a 46\" 6 series.  Hands down the 6 series had some serious clarity/colors going on.  But the 46\" 6 series was way out of my budget.  I started to look at Sonys and the only ones worth buying were again way over my budget.  There were a few older Sonys but again comparing it to the 650 no chance.  So I kept researching for another 5 weeks.  I kept going back to the Samsung 650.  I compromised.  smaller screen for better PQ and options.  I bought the 40\".  I measured my viewing distance to be 11ft.  40\" is plenty.  I was warned about Samsung's poor customer service and poor quality control.  I did not get the extended overpriced service contract from the store and feel I can do better getting one aftermarket at a more reasonable price.  I am going to get an extended warranty.

I have comcast and the HD channels come in incredible.  Blu-Ray is breathtaking.  DVDs are even breathtaking.  I got Monster 800 HDMI cables and i see the difference.  My minor complaints are with the sound (its good but could be better) and the remote's odd wheel clicker (its not good, doesn't work smooth).  Other than that no complaints.

Before I get down on all fours to occasionally kiss the televisions stand in between singing its praises let me first cover the few problems there are.First and I know it's been a point of complaint in many of the other reviews but they are spot on, the remote scroll wheel is obnoxious. Its response time, although fluid, is delayed by almost a full second. Leading to you scrolling well past what you intended to click about half the time. Fortunately it allows you in most instances to forgo the scroll wheel for standard downward and upward click buttons, much like the new Zunes allow you to both touch and click scroll.The ultra clear gloss glass panel does pick up glare very easily, so make sure you have a place away from the sun to put this if you want to really enjoy the picture. Personally once I closed the blinds in the living room and turned the lights down (which is how I would be using this set, glare or no) it disappeared.It seems that the 120Hz generates mixed felling among people. I have had many friends over to watch various movies and about half (including me) love the look it creates. The added frame rate makes it seem almost real to me, like looking through a window. Well others had me turn it off complaining that it looked like we were watching a video game.The first thing I did when I got the TV set up was pop the Orange Box into my 360 elite and started a new Half Life 2 campaign at Ravenholm. My hands started to shake as I walked, crowbar at the ready, through the first building. The image clarity was breathtaking. Gordon Freeman kicked the bucket often as I spent more time just taking in the scenery and all the colors I had been missing instead of focusing on the firefights.This television has breathed life back into my movie collection. The added clarity allows me to catch subtle extra in favorite movies that had gone unnoticed in the 50 previous viewing. The greens, blues, and reds almost jumped off of the screen. The only complaint I can find is that with such a high resolution it's a pain waiting for inputs to catch up. With most games running natively at less than 720p and only still subscribing to basic cable the up scaling can leave you feeling very disappointed. About 75% of the time I feel like my television just isn't being used to its full potential. The only saving grace is Blu-Ray, outside of that it's a matter of waiting for technology to catch up.On top of the wonderful picture the TV produces the menus are colorful and easy to navigate. It doesn't take much fiddling at all to get the settings just the way you like it. The preset modes are also very nice with my personal favorites being the game and cinema. The USA Today RSS feeds are a nifty feature at first but after bring it up a few times the novelty wore off and I went back to just using my laptop witch is far easier to navigate. It would have been nice to see the ability to update firmware over the Ethernet cable but I can understand it being left out to save off crashes half way through.The television itself is pleasing on the eyes with the red touch of color adding band of deep red across all sides of the televisions but far more pronounced along the top and bottom. The color is very difficult to detect when the TV is on prevent it from being a distraction.For anyone looking for a wonderful 1080p TV for multiple inputs I can't state enough this is the TV you need!", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Television", "Author": "Shopper 138", "ReviewID": "R2PGQ2JBH4V9ZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "White glove service was great.

Smith", "ReviewID": "R2W9EG1P6MO4BY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been dying to get my hands on this LCD ever since I bought my PS3 and I was very impressed by the 120Hz Auto Motion Plus and how this function dramatically improves movement in video (Especially in Blu-ray). My option was summed to either the Sony Bravia or Samsung LNT4071. Price wise, I went for the Samsung. And right before I decided to drop it in the shopping cart, I saw the newest model LN40A650 was available. In comparison, it didn't hurt to get the latest model. I hesitated for a while because of the price but amazon.com has the best price with free shipping (at the time). At any other retailer, you would pay a minimum of [...].Pros: Visually, the Samsung is top notch. With Auto motion plus, it doubles the frame rate making everything you see visually smooth. Some people can't handle this galactic function of awesome-ness so you have the option to \"tone it down\" or you can turn it completely off. The design is sleek (I wax this TV more than my car) and hardly any problems with glare disrupting the screen view. This TV is very versatile. Connecting peripherals such as the PS3, laptops/computers, etc. comes with ease using HDMI with hardly any extra measures. Personally, I've made great use of the Entertainment Modes on the Samsung. There are various preset modes for your convenience such as Cinema, Game, Sports, and \"Off\" allowing you to customize it manually. I use game mode a lot. I have a very dedicated relationship with my PS3 (I wax this too...). I haven't tried viewing pictures and Videos on the Samsung via USB but I thought that was a very impressive function as well. It also has functions for Power Saving and Auto Volume but \"I WANT POWER!\" so I have those turned off. Even the remote is really sleek. It has the same shine and red tint as the TV. There is even a button for the remote's backlighting.Cons: The only real problem I've noticed with this TV is the audio. The sound really sucks. For those of you who rely on audio from the TV and if you want a real optimal sound experience, you should get the LN40A750 because it has a built in subwoofer. But I knew what I was getting into with this TV. I'm getting a surround sound system so sound off the TV really doesn't do much for me.As a final note, I noticed a lot of people were very hesitant on amazon.com's white glove service. I was one of them. But after experiencing it, there is a great level of reliability (at least in Miami). They called me 4 days after I ordered the TV and asked me if I'm available the next day to receive it. They dropped it off and they even waited for me to check for dead pixels or any damage to the product. I received it 1 week earlier than amazon.com declared shipped from Cincinnati, Ohio. I would definitely order again from Amazon.com.I'm very happy with this TV!

Kennedy \"AK\"", "ReviewID": "R1AVS6VK5UHWXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my 6-Series about a week ago, and now that I've had a chance to get to know it, I have to say I'm pretty happy about the whole thing.  The picture is as good as I remembered seeing it in the store (ventured to Best Buy to see it in person).  The clarity is unbelievable.  Now obviously, it depends on what your source input is, but this TV gets the most out of each.  I still haven't been able to watch anything in the pure 1080P yet (need to get a Blu-Ray player, which I intend to do, as soon as the price drops below eleventy-million dollars).For now, just watching shows and sports from my digital cable box has been amazing.  I find it curious that different HD channels broadcast in different resolutions (ESPN - 780p, TBS - 1080i), and you can see the difference if you pay attention.  It seems certain programming shows up with more clarity than others, but I guess that's to be expected.I'm not a fan of some of the presets (Sports/Game/Cinema) because they eliminate certain options when activated.  To each his/her own, you have to really play around with them to find which suits you best.  While the Cinema mode probably has the best performance, I'm not a fan of how generally dark it makes the picture seem.  I usually just leave it on Standard view, and make my own adjustments within.With regard to a lot of the complaints in other reviews about the remote:  don't worry about it.  One, it's a remote, has little to no affect when enjoying your television.  Two, chances are you're using your cable or satellite remote the majority of the time.  Three, you don't actually HAVE to use the click wheel to navigate the screen.  I find it odd/amusing that no one mentions this when complaining incessantly about some insignificant feature of the remote.  Ok, Samsung probably overshot in the design and didn't pay enough attention to the actual functionality of it, but oh well.  Within the iPod-esque clickwheel are actual up/down/left/right buttons which can simply be pressed, thus negating the need to use the somewhat unresponsive wheel.  There, happy?The shipping was OK, though not exactly \"quick\".  The tracking page for CEVA needs some work, and I still don't understand why my shipment needed to be routed from Cincinnati (origin) to ORLANDO before making its way to me here in Manhattan.  In any case, I got it about a week after I ordered it.  They didn't offer to take it out of the box or anything to set it up but I wasn't aware of this until I got home (I wasn't there for delivery, my girlfriend was).  I would suggest calling CEVA's shipment facility to get better details on where your TV is, and when it will arrive.All in all, not a bad experience, and certainly worth the low price tag.  The TV itself is amazing, so I wouldn't let the prospect of ordering such an expensive electronic online deter you.  When it comes to picture clarity, this thing is top notch (my friend has a Bravia and said he likes mine better...not to mention he paid $600 more for his, ha).

If you do, you have no life whatsoever. I bought this TV for my bedroom, about 6 ft away from my viewing distance. I watch mainly HD live broadcast, late night HD movies, and Bluray movies and games with PS3 console player over the weekend. Absolutely perfect!Picture is too sharp and bright on all the presets that you have to tinker with the contrast, brightness and backlighting to suit your taste. CNET reviewed the 52LNA650 and recommended some settings for movie mode via HDMI in a dark room(see CNET website)but this is a smaller version of that TV, and it will be much sharper and brighter, less grainy than its 52 inch sibling. So tune it according to your taste.For games, you can just leave it on Dynamic Mode and it's fine. For live broadcast and Sports, here are the settings I find pleasing:Mode: Standard,Contrast-95, Brightness-45, Backlighting-6, Sharpness-50, Color-55:Detailed settings: Black Adjust: Off,Dynamic contrast: Off, Gamma: 0, Color Space: Native,Flesh tone: 0, Edge enhancement: OnWhite Balance submenu: Leave it alone!Picture option submenu: Color tone: normal, size: 16:9, Digital NR: Off,DNIe: grayed out, HDMI: grayed out, film mode: grayed out,Blue mode: Off, Auto motion plus: Medium.I switched from Blockbuster to Netflix for streaming movies to this TV, via my Macbook( I will try Roku soon) and it's good enough quality, like a good old VHS tape, mainly because of broadband speed, 2-3mps average in my neighborhood. By the time broadband speed is NOT LIMITED by this greedy providers, it will be much better then. I saw downloads from Apple TV on HD and it's amazing. Soon, streaming HD videos and movies will not be far behind.Back to the Samsung 40LNA650, the picture quality is as good or even better than the Sony 40XBR6. It should be, since Sony gets their LCD panels from Samsung for ther XBR6 and up. Did I mention video processing is excellent? Whether 1080p Bluray, 1080i or 720p HD channels ,this TV set can display brilliant colors and shades. Even SD channnels are good.Unless you can afford the top-of-the-line 950 series,not much difference in picture quality between the 650, 750 and 850 series, so buy this one!It's a bargain at $1239, even free shipping with Amazon.

This Samsung 40\" model is absolutely awsome and far exceeds my expectations. It has a phenomenal picture and I'm finding it very difficult to watch non HD channels. The TV set up and installation was very simple with an HDMI cable; not so for my HD cable box, but that's another story. The sound is also better than expected. The picture and sound control menus are fairly easy to navigate, and you will want to tweak them, but basic factory settings are very impressive right out of the box. The remote has way too many buttons and features which you can't use, and the instruction manual, typical of many high end electronics products, leaves a lot to be desired. I have given this product 5 stars because of it's overall quality, and Amazon's price makes it a great value. I was not impressed with Pilot Freight, Amazon's shipper of choice. They handed my TV off to a sub-contractor and did not forward any contact information except for my name and address. The shipper, CB Freight had sent me a notice by snail mail asking for further contact information; pitiful. My TV sat in their warehouse for at least 72 hours. The white glove delivery service was fine, and Amazon's customer service was very helpful, but they need better tracking and communication once the product leaves the warehouse.

GUESS WHAT? It happened. About a week in the sound started cutting out on it and after a couple of times I called Samsung and they were very good about offering to send someone to my home to check it out but I thought I would give Amazon's customer service a chance first. I explained to them the situation and asked that they make good on their offer to send a new one. NO PROBLEM. Shipped out a new one that day, arrived in 5 days, CEVA boxed up the old one, same driver set up new one and I have had no problems since. I figured I saved about $600 over what I could have bought it for at Best Buy. I would have had to haul it myself and doubt my customer service experience would have been as good when something went wrong. Hope this helps some of you that are considering buying this model on line. If so I highly recommend Amazon.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Bang for the Buck!", "Author": "J. Fatz", "ReviewID": "RMF1WNXOGMCGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first considered adding an LCD to my stable of displays, I was a little hesitant at first since LCDs tend to look like, well, LCDs. I am very spoiled by my current Samsung FPT5084X 50\" plasma with its richness and overall ability to display a picture as it was meant to be shown. I could get into why plasma has a leg up on LCDs in showing a truer picture as intended by the director but that would be a lecture that may cause severe pain to those looking for reviews on the topic of their choice.All that being said, the White Glove delivery showed up on time, upboxed, and hook it up in record time. (I made sure that the connections of choice were in place to insure first time proper setup) I will say on first viewing it was brilliant! And I do mean brilliant to the point of flattening the picture and looking like a, well, LCD. But not to fear, a quick seat of the pants adjustment of the contrast, Brightness, and Back Light level brought the offending picture under control. The colors and the black levels are pretty impressive but the true ability of the display will be found once my calibration equipment comes back from its annual re-calibration and then I can find how well it actually can display the grey scale and color temperature after performing an ISF calibration on it.Ah, the remote is interesting since the buttons look to be the size of those found on phones designed for seasoned citizens with eye sight beginning to dim with age. Very large buttons with large numbers, symbols, and a really neat click/rotate navigation wheel. This wheel allows you to do directional navigation that so many other remotes do, but the wheel also rotates so if you have a scrolling menu it will do so with a spin of the wheel. This along with a switch to turn on/off the back light with button presses should help with navigation while watching a movie with a reduce ambient light so as not to interfere with your properly calibrated display.On fast action scenes, I have not been able to discern artifacting with fast movement and must say that even a Standard Definition picture is displayed very well. The HD picture is first rate and must say it almost gets my attention as well as the Sammy Plasma in the living room. For the money I must say that I am not disappointed, but after calibration I am expecting to be blown away by the quality of the picture. As for the Touch of Color, it has the effect of reducing the impact of having a solid shiny black frame to one that feels blended.Did I buy this unit for ToC, no, but rather for the ability and capability that this unit has for the money, Auto Setup which locates all inputs, scans for all channels, identifies what type of input such at Sat, Cable, etc, and on and on it goes. Not to mention the ability to perform proper calibrations for a qualified Calibrator to adjust the grey-scale and color temperature, which for me is Nirvana since that is what I do for a living.By the way, did I mention that the price that this unit is available for from Amazon is actually a killer price?

Geary", "ReviewID": "RRW09L75VBYHU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought mine from Amazon on July 1st, so I've had it now for almost 3 months.  I spent 6 months researching TVs, both plasma & LCD, and the new technology of 120hz & AutoMotion Plus have raised the picture quality of LCDs up to the point where they are a reasonable challenger to plasmas without any of the drawbacks that plasmas have. The picture is simply amazingly sharp & the colors are perfect on this Samsung model.  No motion artifacts typical of previous LCDs.  Blu-ray will blow your mind on this TV.  For those of you who feel you must tinker with settings to get the best picture possible, Samsung has made many of the settings adjustable without having to access the service menu, plus many websites like Cnet have posted settings to improve on the default picture settings.  One note of caution on these aftermarket tweaks...  Samsung has changed the firmware on this model many times since they hit the market in the spring of 2008, and the tweaks you read about are specific to the firmware version on the TV.  In other words, don't try Cnet's settings for version 1002M or 3M firmware if your TV has 1004M firmware.  It won't look good.  My TV has the 1004M firmware & is perfect as is other than one slight change to the picture brightness. There have been some sporadic problems with picture quality on this model, one of which is mentioned here on Amazon's website above - the resetting issue - which no longer is a problem unless you get a set manufactured in early 2008.  Another problem listed on HDTV websites is something called the \"purple haze\".  It's one of those problems where if you didn't know about it, you'd never notice it unless you are an experienced videophile.  It's a slight purple tint on the black portions of the screen, especially when viewed from an angle in a completely darkened room.  You can see the same effect on your LCD computer monitor when booting up & the screen goes blank or has large portions of black areas.  I had it on my new Samsung & easily got rid of it by turning the brightness level down a couple of points (from factory setting of 45 down to 41).  Samsung's advertised 50,000/1 dynamic contrast ratio is not quite correct according the independent tests I've read on the net & you can see for yourself easily when viewing the picture off-axis in a darkened room.  Believe me, this isn't as big a deal as some make it out to be.  The picture quality is simply so stunning that it overshadows these minor drawbacks.  If for some reason you find anything wrong with your set that you just can't live with, Amazon is especially accommodating and will get you a replacement that you're happy with, just remember to keep the box it's shipped in & make your decision quickly or you'll have to instead be stuck with a Samsung tech coming to your home.  As far as Amazon's service goes, they're great!  I got my TV delivered 6 days after I placed the order & it would have been sooner had I been able to take a day off work.  The delivery guys unpacked & set up the TV in what has to be record time of about 7 minutes.

They gave me a time-frame of 10am-2pm, but the delivery guy called around 11am and said he'd be there in 20 minutes. He was very friendly but obviously not very tech smart. He didn't even know what an HDMI cable is. Not a problem to me, but just keep that in mind if you're expecting these guys to hook up your system.I couldn't be happier with this TV. Like everyone else has said, the picture is really amazing. I was worried at first because the TV was saying \"No Signal\" when trying to run my PS3, but I reversed the plugs on the HDMI cable and that fixed it. I don't know what that was all about as there's no indication on the cable showing which end needs to go where, but it works fine now so I'm not concerned.I haven't had a chance to watch any Blu-ray movies yet, but the HD channels and DVDs look really great, especially with the 120Hz Auto Motion on high. I don't know why some people are complaining about this. I think it makes the picture seem to jump out of the screen at times. There are so many options and settings to adjust that it's a bit overwhelming, but all the standard settings feel the best to me so far. Cinema mode makes the screen a bit too dark, and the colors don't stand out at all. One extremely minor thing I noticed about the picture is if you sit too close, you see the picture blurring quite a bit, especially around faces. I made the mistake of plopping down my chair right in front of the TV ready to see some AMAZING picture and was quite disappointed. But after I realized this isn't like my old 19\" TV and moved a bit further back, you don't see that blurring, just a sharp, beautiful picture.I have no issues with the sound quality. It's obviously not movie theater quality, but it's a very full sound, with plenty of bass. The surround sound option doesn't give the feeling of \"surround sound\", it just changes the sound a bit giving it a very slight echo, which I like, so for now, I'm keeping it turned on.The remote is very cheap looking with large buttons and a generic design, and the dial that you're supposed to turn to scroll up and down menus is terrible. Sometimes you spin it a quarter inch and it scrolls down 4 rows, and sometimes you have to spin it around more than halfway to go down one row. It also seems unable to decide which direction goes up or down. It is frustrating, but you can just push the dial instead of spinning it, so it's a non-issue.So if you're like I was and spending hours and hours researching HDTVs, stop right now, and just buy this TV.

After the color, my main focus was to buy a unit that displays moving objects as smooth as possible as oppossed to a stair case effect in cheaper units, which I find very annoying.Installation was a snap.  The layout of the unit is very clean. When I misplaced the remote control I became aware that it does not have any visible panel with buttons and switches.  We discovered that you can still control the unit in a touch sensitive panel that is invisible but can be located near the power LED.I found lots of marks of a sensible design.  For instance, when the unit is operating the channel number on screen disappears for a clean image and even the power LED goes off to avoid the distraction of a piercing red LED while you watch the program.In sum,  I am very satisfied with my new set.This units is a superb TV set. The balance between quality, size and price is unbeatable. I love the colors.  I love the way it sets up automatically, scanning the channel spectrum and memorizing the ones with good signals.

The driver pulled the TV out of the box and plugged it in to see if it was working (it doesn't necessarily have to be connected to your cable to test it, just plugged in). This is recommended before you sign for the TV. If the TV doesn't work, you don't sign for it and he takes it back. Mine worked perfectly out of the box.The picture is fantastic. I calibrated the TV using the THX calibration menu in the DVD movie \"Toy Story\" (you can order the blue calibration glasses at the THX website--[...] for a few dollars). The picture looked even better after that. The picture is very bright (I usually have it turned down a few notches in brightness using the \"energy saving\" modes) and clear and the colors vivid. Black is very black as it should be. I would say this is a better picture then the 1500 dollar Panasonic Plasma TH-50PX75U I bought for my dad--if only because of the greater brightness-but also because to me the TV looks sharper (true,the Samsung is 1080p resolution-but experts keep telling me I shouldn't be able to see a difference at this screen size) and the colors truer to life. There's dozens of settings you can tweak with this set so you can get things just right. Sound is good, but not great. I have no problems with the sound. Besides, you can always add a home theater sound system that beats any built in sound. The red colored frame is very subtle and looks good. The remote is easy to use with big, lighted keys. The remote has a navigation wheel, which is a little tricky to use, but works well once you get used to it. You will probably be using your cable or satellite company supplied remote most of the time anyway.I can't say if the less expensive, but similar Samsung LCD models would be any different in picture quality then this model (IE, the models without the 120 Hz feature?), as I did not compare them. The 120 HZ feature, which is designed to smooth the picture during picture movement, in my opinion, is very subtle. I've compared the picture with 120HZ on and off. In some programming you can notice a smoother picture and some you can not. I think overall the feature is desirable. I just leave the setting on all the time as it does not seem to degrade the picture in any noticeable way, as some others have said.In any case, I can tell you with all honesty that you will love this TV!", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best HDTV I've Seen - AWESOME PQ", "Author": "J.

It is also true that the sound is not the best (although if you use the \"custom\" sound setting you should be able to play with the treble and bass controls).

Previously I owned the Samsung LNS3241D, a 32\" 720p television that I was very happy with, but I felt it was time to trade up to 1080p.  For my old tv, I spent over a month on research alone and another month finding the tv I wanted before purchasing.  This time around, it took about five minutes to decide this tv was the one.DeliveryI bought the tv and eagerly awaited its arrival.  I had heard of people having problems with CEVA shipping, so I was a bit worried.  I checked the tracking one morning to discover that the tv had already been shipped (this was over a week earlier than had been reported) and was waiting at the local shipping facility.  I had heard that people had been experiencing glitches with the tracking where for each day they checked it would say their package had arrived on that day, so I didn't get my hopes up.  However, CEVA called me that day and scheduled the delivery.  When they arrived, they took the tv in, popped it out of the box, placed it on the table and got it all running.  Suffice to say, I could not have been happier with the shipping and delivery.The TelevisionFirst off, the image quality is phenomenal.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to tell the difference in detail between my old 32\" 720p tv and this one, but I am happy to say that the difference was readily apparent.  Not only are the images sharper, but the color range is much wider and the contrast is substantially higher.  Running my ps3 with XvYCC enabled, words can't describe the beauty and breadth of color I was experiencing.  The blacks are deep and rich and the refresh rate is so good I haven't experienced any blur or pixelization.  The clear glass panel screen invites glare, which can be annoying, but the benefits to color and contrast it brings more than makes up for it.  Even SD programs look better.The 120 hz feature can do amazing things for action scenes, sports or video games, but for most movies I leave it off (it tends to bring CG right to the front of the screen, and it becomes distracting during dramatic moments).  I was worried that the Touch of Color would be distracting, but in our living room it's so subtle I hardly ever notice it.  The clickwheel remote is obnoxious but fortunately you can just click the buttons instead of scrolling so no big deal.  The menus are easy to navigate.  The speakers aren't as good as the speakers in my old tv, but I usually have it plugged in to my external speakers anyways.All in all, I couldn't be happier with this tv.  More than anything else I was surprised by the sheer richness and breadth of the color range.  Samsung has proven themselves to be a leader in the LCD market, and this television is a stellar example of why they're at the top.

The 40\" LN40A650 appeared to be the right size for me, and this LCD HDTV is definitely suitable for viewing in a medium-size room.From the onset, I was impressed by its sharp, bright, deep color imaging and its ability to deliver incredible contrast levels.  These attributes likely contributed to delivering some scenes that appeared so life-like as to have a near three-dimensional quality.  Its 120 Hz Auto Motion Plus system did a very decent job in significantly reducing motion blur and judder.  Extreme-motion sequences aren't quite as \"fluid\" (seamless) as the plasmas, but the LN40A650 comes pretty close to achieving that.  In evaluating this Samsung with remote in hand, I made some direct comparisons with a nearby Sony XBR LCD.  To these eyes, Samsung delivered a more stunning performance.  And what few reviewers fail to comment on--and something that is important to me--is how well a HDTV handles standard definition sources / channels.  I can tell you this:  This Samsung model handles them very well.I ordered this model from Amazon, because of a special sale at the time and because of prior positive shopping experience with them.  The TV arrived at my hourse prior to the estimated shipping time, and it was delievered at my convenience in good condition by CEVA Shipping.  I have had this set for almost a month and continue to discover more features I like about it.

I was actually very happy with the Philips Ambilight that I purchased last year and was not looking to purchase another set until I saw the auto motion plus feature on display at a local retailer's showroom.  It seemed to give movie scenes a more three dimensional and mildly soap opera type look.  Some people love it and some hate it.  It really draws me into the film, especially when watching Blu-Ray.  I recently rented the Blu-Ray version of the Sand Pebbles and it was like being there on the set during filming, and that was over forty years ago.

Anyway,  There are three settings, low, medium, and high, and I keep mine on all the time.  The effect is more pronounced on some movies then others.  As far as black levels, picture sharpness etc.. I have to admit I prefer my Philips ambilight.  However, my Philips does not have the auto motion plus, so I am dividing my viewing right now between the two sets.  My advice to the potential buyer is to ignore critics of the auto motion plus feature since they are expressing subjective opinions.  You really have to check it out for yourself and decide.", "Date": "August 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Best out there!", "Author": "Rolando B.

The SONY had a silver boarder around the frame that was distracting to me. I love my Samsung TV after having it for only six days now. I was afraid of the shipping horrors reported on this site, but the price was so good I went with Amazon anyway. BB and CC both wanted $1,499.99 plus tax for this TV and would not come down one doallar. Amazon had it for $1,249.99 tax free and free shipping.  Yes I know \"Free shipping!\" After purchasing on Nov 26th, I was given a delivery estimate of 09 Dec. I'm in central CA and the TV came from Reno,NV. I thought immediately this seemed to be a very long two weeks to get to me. One day after my TV shipped it was in Sacramento, about 250 miles from me. I was then given a new delivery date of Thurs 04 Dec. But it was in Sacramento on Sat 29 Dec.at 4:00am. It remained in Sac for three days until Tues 02 Dec where it made it to Fresno, my local delivery area. I called the local CO. for a delivery appointment and was told it was to be delivered Friday 05 Dec. I said \"I would not be home then and how about Thursday the original date I was told anyway?\" They said OK we will deliver Thursday Dec 04th 12:00pm to 4:00pm. I received my TV as promised on Thursday at 2:30pm.  The delivery many asked me if I wanted the white glove routine of remove from box and plug in? I declined because the box was in perfect condition and I was having it installed the next day anyway. I signed for it and the next day Firefox installed it and set up my remote for Direc-TV and I have enjoyed an outstanding picture ever since. I will be getting the HD-DVR and new dish for HD tomorrow and will then have an even more superior picture! The deliver was free and I received the TV on 04 Dec five days earlier than originally promised. What's not to like? Why it had to sit in Sacramanto for three days I have no idea? But I am still very happy with the overall experience.  Also I found out there were three manufacture dates of this model TV this year. April I believe had the shutdown problems with some sets, then again in July. After keying in my serial# on the Samsung site, I found out my TV was in November! No problems at all with TV turning itself off after running many hrs. So thank you Amazon for the newest version of this model# and no TAX and free shipping. Thank you to Samsung for a beautiful looking TV set (touch of red is at top and bottom only on this 650, all four sides on the 750) and so far a superior running TV, no problems with anything. No idea why some have complained about the remote?, works fine for me. So five stars for Samsung all the way, this TV is the best one out there for the money as far as I'm concerned!

While watching, the volume will go begin climbing to max volume.  Typically, the TV gives a warning that this is about to happen because it will move one or two steps (e.g. From 15 to 16).  Then less than a minute later it starts moving all the way to 100.This is not a remote issue as we have been able to duplicate with all remotes with the batteries removed.We have had moderate success cleaning the side panel to remove all smudges on the glass.

I had planned on buying the extended warranty prior to my expiration (not sure if it is still in effect, but I did get 3 extra months over the standard one year warranty by registering on-line).  Anyway, so far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!  I had done much research prior to buying my first LCD and it was the massive amount of 5-stars on Amazon and all of the comments from the satisfied buyers that clinched the deal -- although I did go to a store to view the quality first-hand.  Even though I waited for a sale to patronize one of my local stores, since I was hesitant to purchase an item this large on-line for fear of damage in transit, Amazon's price and service just could not be beat.  All my fear's went out the window with Amazon's white-glove delivery service -- it was first class (although I did not need them to do anything more than remove the outer box to confirm that the TV was not physically damaged) -- the delivery people were friendly and courteous, and it had not been in a huge truck filled with lots of boxes -- just a small van, for \"just my tv\" (almost :-)The image quality is second to none -- with the sound being quite good, but I am only using the Surround-Sound speakers that are in the unit and am more than happy with them -- excellent clarity and fine for those that do not need to blast out the room (I'm sure with external speakers it would sound incredible!). It is truly a pleasure to watch Blu-Ray discs with this TV.  The colors and clarity are tack on -- compared to others that I saw while in the store.  Only one thing -- for those who had not viewed a movie on HD or Blu-Ray before:  some of those actors and actresses are not as perfect as you may have originally thought. :-)Another clincher for this tv over some others (same with the Blu-Ray player) was ease of applying upgrades.  My tv/player is not hooked up to any cable, internet, etc but I can easily download the firmware onto a dedicated pen-drive and quickly apply them to the units. Just be careful to follow the easy instructions and the process is effortless.There is only one 'problem' that I can think of in the year that I have had the unit -- I had set the Mhz rate to 120 when I first set up the tv, thinking since I purchased it because of the faster-than-others rating, I should use it.  I was shocked to watch my first Blu-Ray and watch what appeared to be a cheap soap opera -- come to find out that IS what happens at 120 Hz.  Well, it was terrible and at first I was disappointed -- it was cool to see so much detail, but it did not feel like a movie anymore. I did a little research and found out that only for gaming and such do you need the 120 Hz setting; set at 60, the picture is still crystal clear but you feel like you are watching a movie!  \"Problem\" solved!

As most people say, I reviewed this tv as well as many others for quite some time.  The thing that I was really interested in getting was the Automotion 120hz.  This is really the only negative I have about the tv.  While Automotion 120hz is great for sports and bluerays I have it turned off for everything else.  I watch a lot of sports so this is no problem for me, but if you are looking at this tv and you don't watch a lot of sports I'm not sure 120hz is worth the extra money.  You may be able to save money and get a lower model.  Other than that though this tv has a great set of features and an incredible picture.  A lot of the reviews I read many people complained about the remote's click wheel.  Let me say if you have ever used an iPod its very similar.  I actually liked it in a way.  The nice thing, however, is that instead of spinning it you can just click up, down, left, or right so if you don't like it it's really no problem.  (Besides your cable or satelite company will provide you with a new remote so no big deal.)  The other thing people complained about was the touch of color red.  The room my tv is in has moderate to low light levels.  You can definitely still see the red along the top and bottom.  It's more than I prefer, but it's nothing that should stop you from buying. (In my opinion)  The last thing I will talk about is Ceva delivery.  This was by far my biggest concern.  I was very leary about ordering something this expensive over the internet.  I read a lot of negatives about them and heard some horror stories.  However, they delivered my tv in 4 or 5 days.  The guys that delivered were very professional and everything went smoothly.

I asked him if this was a common problem and he stated it was very rare for an LCD to have problems, I don't know about that but I know I didn't have to ship it and the guy came to me in just a few days! That was service! For someone that works in broadcast television, I need my television not just for enjoyment but also for work. This was great service, I don't think any of the other manufacturers do this! He also stated that samsung does this for anyone in the continental US, I don't know about other parts of the world.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is the real deal", "Author": "M.

Well-worth every penny. My sister has the 46\" Series 7, which is really great, so I wasn't sure at first how the Series 6 would compare. But so far it's excellent: Color and blacks are reproduced nicely and the 120Hz processing is pretty amazing. I think it looks better with TV shows than it does with movies, because with movies it makes the image appear too \"video-ish\", but of course that's a personal preference, and you can easily change the settings to whatever you like. Samsung is the #1 seller of flat-panel TVs in the U.S. for very obvious reasons.", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Stunning TV", "Author": "Michael T. Parsons \"MThoren68\"", "ReviewID": "R33G4RNY0BVYFD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I preface this by saying that, while I am not a videophile, I did do quite a good amount of research re: Samsung, Sony, Toshiba and Sharp.  Like most everyone else, Samsung and Sony are well ahead of the pack, and between those two, I just could not find any reason to pay the extra money between this and the Sony Z series.  I think I would end up taking the 650 over the Z series for even money.First, do not be afraid of the TOC.  Everyone who has been over has commented they like it.  Second, despite this TV being near a large picture window, I notice no glare.  Third, the picture is stunning.  My prior TV was an HD Wega, great tube picture.  When I first hooked this TV up, I only had rabbit ears (I was between cable companies), I got the network channels in HD and they looked excellent.  Next came the Blu Ray player and I was amazed.  This TV doesn't look great compared to other TV's, it just plain looks great.  Just this week I got my new cable hook-up, and all the HD channels look fantastic.The menu system is fairly easy to pick up on.  Once you play around with it a bit, you can fly right through.  I will say the picture adjustments are a bit overwhelming.  I would encourage you to Google \"LN40A650 calibration\" and try a few of the settings other people have selected as a starting point and go from there.  While there are some good suggestions, it ultimately does come down to personal preference, and you just have to play with it a bit to get a feel for the effect the various settings have on the picture.  There is no \"perfect\" set-up.It is very nice having some of the inputs on the side.  Very accessible, not all TV's have this.If you are going to drop this kind of coin on a flat screen, I can't imagine not having a decent home theater set-up, even if it's just something like the Polk Audio RM6750 5.1 Channel Home Theater Speaker System for $250.  Nothing special, but excellent video deserves at least passable audio.I am glad I picked this over the LN40A630.  I almost got the 630 just because of the matte screen, but glare has been no issue for me and I do think the non-matte screen does help the colors \"pop\" just a little bit more.This is probably the best $1,100 I ever spent, and I don't have a single regret.

GREAT Picture, full of features, 120Hz rocks!", "Author": "A. K. Naravanekar", "ReviewID": "R3BL2PO3EW91XH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality is amazing. The 120 Hz is not just hoopla, you can really see the difference especially when playing games or watching fast paced movies with a lot of split second action. Of course the 1080p is great. If you hook a Cat-5 (Ethernet/LAN) cable to it (yes its got an Ethernet port!!) it'll let you read news, weather updates and stock through live feeds. The TV speakers are good enough (trust me they can get loud!) to be used by themselves in case you want to wait for sometime until you get a home theater or something. The remote is good but for a couple of flaws. I love the illuminated keys button which makes all the keys on the remote glow with just the right light. Very useful when watching movies in the dark, keeps you from tilting the remote is various directions to get that light bouncing off something so you can reading what you're pressing.The picture looks great! I've used it with my xbox 360 and is it great or what! 4 HDMI ports are great and the placement is good. The 1 port on the side panel is great to plug in your laptop or something. It also has a USB port which you can connect to any mass storage device (external Hard Disk, Portable Hard Disk or even a pendrive). The TV plays mp3s, movies and images (most formats) directly from the media. You can even connect a wireless adapter (sold by samsung) to enable the live content I mentioned before.If you are thinking of buying an HDTV I very highly recommend this one. It looks great in the living room (with the touch of red), it has amazing picture quality, load of features, is light in weight, doesn't get hot, 120Hz technology works like an anti-blur fast moving images thing and the price is super sweet!Other thoughts- Spend some time calibrating this TV.

After buying this and having it for a couple weeks now I'm completely sure that I made the right decision.  The image is crisp, the contrast is great and the features are as well.  Looking beyond the picture (which I can't say enough about) the TV does a great job at recognizing inputs from many different sources and switching between them.  I don't even know if I hooked them up right.  I think the TV is smarter than me.  The audio is satisfactory but I bought an accompanying Samsung home theater system for something like $200 and it improves the experience exponentially.  Blu Rays looks amazing obviously and television not so much unless it's a digital signal but that's to be expected although with a simple $20-30 digital antenna you can pick up HD channels in all their glory for free.  My TV picked some up even without the antenna--don't ask how because I don't know.  The USB input is fun for pictures and music if you so wish, and I am loving the amount of AV inputs supplied.

Still, I always have admired Sony's quality and I originally purchased the Sony 40\" XBR6. While the Sony had a very good image, I did notice some slight motion blur as it only has an 8ms response time. In addition to this drawback and the fact that the Sony was $2,100.00 at the time I bought it, I decided to return it in favor of the Samsung 40\" A650. Not only does this Samsung have a equally good, if not superior image to the Sony, it also has a 4ms response time and absolutely no motion blur. The best part is the price was $800 dollars cheaper than the Sony. Overall this TV beats out the competition and its quality can't be beat. I thought I would give Sony a try, but it turns out I should have trusted the experience of my family members, as the Samsung HDTV's just can't be beat for the quality and price.

Wildermuth \"Russell W\"", "ReviewID": "R3ENEHHRQ3MF7G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV showed up in my Gold Box for around $1200 and I decided to pull the plug.  I'll just give the Pro's and Con's:Pros:- Excellent Picture Quality- 120hz Motion seems a bit unnatural at first but you grow accustomed to it (like the switch from VCR to DVD) and love it.  Haven't tried it yet with the PS3, which should be coming in the mail any day now, but looking forward to it.- Some don't like the touch of color.  I love it.  My parents bought a 550 32\" for the Kitchen and I have to say: #1 I didn't like the look of the light underneath it and #2 After looking at the touch of color on my 650 the 550 looked a little too boring.  Go to PC Richards and check it out, I love it.  I also liked the look of this better than the 750.- Menu's are easy to navigate.Cons:- TV buttons don't light up like on the 750 so they are impossible to see in the dark and barely visible in the light.  This is actually OK because it doesn't distract from the TV and who uses those buttons anyway? :)- The remote is very poorly designed.  Not only is it GIGANTIC, but the fact that there is no enter button by the number pad is just plain annoying.  There is no clear way to program the dvd-like buttons on the bottom of the remote (if you even can).  And after a week of use the remote started to develop a slight rattle (very slight).. sounds like something is loose.  I will be getting an HD box and not using the remote much anyway.  But if you can, I would recommend spending a little extra and getting a Logitech Harmony remote, which I might just do (550 Harmony looks nice and affordable).- White Glove Delivery with Amazon sucks.  Two huge guys carry it up to your room, take it out of the box, hand you a bag of accessories, ask you to sign off on a damages form, and they are out.  Figured for the $200 extra they charge you on Newegg.com it would be something a little more helpful.  Nevertheless, I wanted White Glove so I could check off on the TV for scratches so it served its purpose.- The Glare on the TV is pretty frustrating in the middle of the day with windows facing it.  We have a Sony Bravia with a Matte screen in the living room and that is much better with the glare.  That being said, I like the lively color on my TV better than that.  And we paid about double at the time we bought that one at 46 inches.  Also, the swivel stand came in handy... moved it facing away from the window.  But you might notice some reflection on the blacks of the screen (blacks are real black... that's a good thing).On Par:- Sound is what I expected from a TV.  Might want 5.1 surround if in a living room but its perfect sound for my room setup.Well it might seem like I have more complaints than praise... I am overall very satisfied with my purchase.  The picture is excellent, sound is good, frame is beautiful.  Other than minor accessories, and a glare that I worked around with the adjustable stand, you can't go wrong here.I compared this TV to the Sony KDL4200's in PC Richards and the picture quality was better (less grainy).", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Simply the best", "Author": "Don Watkins", "ReviewID": "R1K0RCJV91RXG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched flat panels long and hard before settling on this one and I couldn't be more pleased.

Movies and games looked great until you watched a scene with fast movement. The motion handling on the set as poor and caused a lot of unsightly blur.I wish the set didn't have these glaring problems as it was amazing otherwise. It seems like LCD tech is flawed in those regards. I've returned the set and will probably get a plasma.

Many people have already written about the pros and cons of this TV.  So, while I will list them briefly, I will concentrate on other items including reliability, power consumption and delivery process.I did research for about 4 months (comparing them with Sony XBR4 and XBR5) before I bought this TV in late Aug 2008.  I know this is outdated now with the advent of 850, 950 and XBR6-8, but this TV is still great at prices lower than $1200.Pros:+ Power consumption can be adjusted through the Settings menu.  I found Medium to be good for my setup (it defaulted to off for my room).  CNET lists this as one of the power efficient TV with as low as <$40/year if you adjust the power setting.+ Low price for the video quality and performance+ Decent SD reception - for SD channels (I do have a few of them)+ Good upcoversion for SD - I have tried a standard non upconverting DVD player, and PS2 (non HD) game on Sony PS3+ Great HD reception - I have a DishHD, had also tested with Blu-ray Game and video on Sony PS3.+ Very easy navigation screens, easy to customize settings.Cons:- You may get a bad panel (I have a SQ01 LN40A650A1F made April 2008).  It is quite possible that this is common in all LCD TVs and it can happen to any brand. My first TV panel had inverted V-shaped lighted pixels (2 inches, increasing in size every day) at 2 places in the bottom of the screen, 6 months after I bought it.  I sent an email to Samsung and got a ticket number.  The next morning I got a call from a service center in Sunnyvale, CA and they decided to order a panel just based on what I said rather than coming to my house and verifying it.  At that time, I wondered how one could decide that without coming and having a look at the TV, so I am suspecting that they may have had a few cases like these.  However, they told me that they have been fortunate with 650 series and have not gotten too may repairs on this series, but you be the judge if they order new panels without even looking at the TV.  Anyway, the service guys came within 4 days of my filing the ticket at the expected time window of 3 hours (they came 10 minutes before scheduled time ended, but changed the panel in 10 minutes), I have had the new panel for the past 2+ weeks, and it looks good again.- Remote while backlit, needs to be pointed at the bottom right of the TV, otherwise does not work well.  Also, you have to cycle through the SOURCE button to go back.- Red Bezel collects lots of dust and there is some reflection on the bevelled edges, particularly if there is window at the side, thanks to the glossy finish.- Sound - now, this is not really fair - if you want good sound, connect to a receiver.  I have it connected to Onkyo HT-SR800 with my DishHD connected through HDMI directly to TV and a TosLink digital optical out to my home theater (you may wonder why, my receiver has only HDMI video pass through, but sound needs digital optical / coax in)- 120Hz probably applies only to blu-ray games (which I do not play), because I do not see any difference in movies/games that you see on TV.  I have seen various reports confirming the same, so this is probably a lot of advertising gimmick.Delivery process:  CEVA delivery is from San Francisco and hence they give a 6 hour window instead of the usual 3 hours.  It took a few phone calls to confirm they indeed are arriving (after seeing multiple complaints about CEVA on this forum I decided to be proactive and was rewarded for it), but the 2 folks that came were courteous, set up the TV on the stand, and showed me that it worked before they left.A note on the price: I purchased at the end of Aug 2008 for $1350 just before Amazon removed the 1 month price guarantee.  Found a temporary price drop to $1264, called Amazon and they refunded $86 back with a note that Amazon stopped the guarantee from September 1, 2008.", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Charlie", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3IEXH3WRD229L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great TV.

The picture is so clear you can see individual whiskers on facial close-ups or, during the world series, individual rain drops.I thought the touch of color was actually subtle LED lighting but it is simply a change in the plastic color.  Barely noticeable.The only thing I haven't figure out is how 120hz is activated.  Whenever I check settings it says 60hz even though I think I have the set up right.  Perhaps it is automatic when screen motion dictates?Finally, the CEVA delivery was a little frustrating as the TV only had to travel about 90 miles from Harrisburg to South Jersey but it sat in the Harrisburg terminal for a few days.  I followed the tracking closely and called CEVA twice and finally picked it up at the South Jersey terminal so I got it 3 days early.

The White Glove delivery service from CEVA logistics was above average experience, they actually called on Friday when it said that it might not ship until Monday(Which was perfect because my satellite provider came to install the HD receiver on Saturday).You can really tell this set is a cut above by the clarity and true color, I know that technology changes all the time but I truly feel this set will live for possibly 10 years and that is a great reason to purchase a above average set like this one.Anyway, you pay for what you get and if you pay just a hair more, I highly recommend buying the Samsung 650 series(40 or 52\") It is truly a better set than the competitor like Sony.

Last year I'd seen my friends super wahoo plasma set and as nice as it was I wasn't actually that impressed. The color was fine but the blacks. and depth of the picture seemed, well ... nothing to rave about. I attributed the no-so-greatness to the contrast ratio - my friends plasma set was about 10,000 to 1.Enter this Samsung LN40A650. First things first. It arrived at my door a day before it was scheduled by Amazon's White Gloves delivery (they called me and asked if the delivery was ok) Two really nice guys set the TV up and made sure everything was in perfect working order. The whole procedure took less than twenty minutes. (note: prep for delivery)Ok, there's my new tv, it's amazing, and so simple to operate anyone no matter how button challanged they might be can easily figure out how to work it.Right out of the box the set performed beyond my wildest expectations. As far as levels of black and gray they are close to perfect. (Lets face it, when you can easily distinguish the cigarette smoke from the fog and the steam coming out of the neighbors tea kettle in the background, they got it right.The contrast ratio is 50,000 to 1 on this set. The sound that's built in is very, very good. I will, one day, set up a nice speaker system, but for now I am nicely impressed with the sound quality and I have 40% hearing loss.This is as close as they are going to get. In years to come this set might need to be replaced because they're going to continue to improve the quality of LCD TV.I've had this set for about a month now and I'm still amazed at he the picture quality.

The picture on both sets is outstanding, I would give a slight edge to the Samsung, but the downside here is that is has a \"polished\" screen, which presents glare if in direct light, expecially if near a window (daytime), so have to be careful where you place the set.  The one area where the Sony beats the Samsung is channel reception and tunning - I have a regular antenna, even with two different ones, the Sony pulls in stations better (especially analog), and there is a slight lag in swithing from station to station with the Samsung, a little annoying for people who channel surf.

The touch of color is a really good look for those that are into design. No cut off problems, no glair problems, and the remote is not as bad as people say. I guess we all know the saying about opinons! I love how it is pretty thin and the hidden speakers. Trust me the speakers are loud and clear and sometimes will make you think a phone on a movie or show is really ringing in your house. The touch controls on the side is pretty cool but you might have trouble seeing them. I see on the new versions they have made them stand out more now. I love the info link on the tv and the fact that hookups are easy to get to. On my phillips lcd it is hard to hook up the plugins, but on this baby its smooth sailing. Not to forget being able to move the tv on the the stand without ever picking it up is great. The only thing about the tv that is not that great is it takes a little time to come on, but so do my other lcds.The delivery service was great, eventhough at first I was about to spend an extra $500-700 because I never had something that size shipped before. Im not scared anymore and recommend this service to anyone. The amazon tracking is off a little so you can go on ceva website to track your package better. The picture quailty is self explainatory and the blu-ray is out of this world. Even my regular HBOhd looks close to blu-ray with the 120hz on high.

Play with the settings to get the look you want because I took some advice off of here for settings and they didn't look good to me at all.

Currently running sd cable box, computer via vga, and xbmc with component cables. I wish I had a ps3 or something else to put some real good hd through the tv but I already bought my toy for the summer.The sd cable box looks much better than I expected, the tv can translate it to look at least half decent and doesn't distort the image as bad as a lot of tvs ive seen. The computer looks great at 1920x1080, no problems I can find with using this tv as a monitor. The xbmc can put out 1080i and looks pretty good considering its a fairly capable digital media player you can get for ~$50.I don't really use the network capabilities much, the stock ticker and news widget are decent but not all that useful since I run this tv as a monitor anyway.For everyone complaining about the wire/fan noise when turning the tv off I don't know if your unit is just a lot louder than mine but it just sounds like a small computer fan stopping and winding down. It really doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but hey to each his own.Yes, the remote is irritating. I don't bother with the track wheel I just click on it instead. I plan on getting a universal anyway so hopefully I won't have to deal with it for too long.The IR receiver does seem to be a little more directional than other tvs, but it doesn't take all that much effort to aim a remote...I wouldn't knock the tv a star for that kind of issue.I ended up paying 1370 for the tv while best buy was trying to charge 1900. I asked them why it was so high and they mentioned that while it is more expensive they allow you to bring the tv in if it breaks and it's not as much of a hastle as dealing with online purchases. Sorry guys, for $500 you better rethink your marketing strategy and perks package. Delivery was great and on time, delivery men took out the tv and made sure it was working properly. Also, the tv comes with a 1 year parts/labor warranty from samsung, so if it breaks you can give them a call and have them come over and take a look at it (depending on where you're at, you may have to send it in).All in all 5 stars from me, good job on a beautiful TV Samsung and I hope everyone has as good an experience as I have had.", "Date": "September 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Stunning picture quality", "Author": "Rohit Gupta \"Rohit\"", "ReviewID": "R2X1E5ZOIFWEOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reviewing almost all the HDTV's in market today for around 2 months, I decided to buy this TV from Amazon, its a master piece by Samsung.

I'm not sure if it's just my television having this problem, but when I run sound from my satellite to my audio system in comparison to video from my satellite to this tv, the audio comes out just a little quicker than the picture does.Also, when I play video games like Call of Duty 4 on the ps3, i notice that there is now a lag-time in which you control the movement and for the screen to move along with the command. Reloading takes a split second slower than my old Olevia 337H 1080i high def television.Those are my only two complaints. This is by far one of the best picture quality televisions out there, and looks magnificent playing dvd or blu-ray movies. High definition on my satellite looks good, but only has a max. video output of 1080i for now. The biggest difference I notice from this compared to my Sony hdtv is the rich levels of black. Also, 120hz works well with video that runs 60fps i.e. ps3 games and most blu-ray movies. But dvd's that run 30fps and many television shows are better off turning the 120z off.

College football was in full swing and our big screen had been sent in for warranty repairs 2 weeks before football season started.  With 4 or 5 games down, our big screen still out of commission, I had to do something.

Stubblefield", "ReviewID": "R34CMSGE4EFR1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off let me say that I have not hooked up my Bluray or any HD (HDMI) fed source to this tv yet. I have only seen it in the store on broadcast HD. The picture was fantastic in the store. I have had my share of LCDs too so I can speak with some authority on PQ. I currently own a Panny 42\" plasma, Samsung 32\" LCD. I bought this tv to game in my office to replace the 32\" that I gave my son. I had intended on buying a Samsung 32\" (1080P, 120MHZ) but when I got to the store I ran across the 40\" 650a as a display model. There were actually 2 of them but I did not know it at the time. One was priced @ $1107 (mine) and the other $999. I had noticed an older couple contemplating the one I was looking at so since I was not in the market for the 40\" I thought I would let them make their decision and come to look @ it after they left. Assmuming of course they did not buy it. Well after about an hour of walking around the store looking at other LCDs I noticed they were gone or so I thought. I went back to look @ the 650a in full confidence that I would not be intruding on someone else's thought buying process. As walked back through the section where it was displayed I thought well they must have deciced against it. I walked around to the other side of the aisle just to take a look at the other display models and I noticed another 650a on the oppiste side directly behind the one I was looking @. I then realized that it was marked down to $999. As I picked up the label to inspect, well, the specs, to make sure it was the same model, the older couple popped up out of nowhere and scared the crap out of me. They told me that they were going to buy the one @ $999 and I thought well that was alot of work to avoid their buying process only to invade their buying process. Now mind you both of these 650as had visible tape residue on the back and front but i was not shakin (I well get to that in a minute). I told them up front that I had seen them looking at the other 650a on the oppiste side and I told them that I was going to wait till they had made up their mind before I came back and stood in front of it for 2 hours to make up my mind. They then told that the sales guy was going to give them the same price on either of the 650a @ $999. Well now we were kindred spirits because I was going to buy the one they didn't buy. So we both proceeded to take the labels off the display so no one else would get any ideas about these models on display and we promptly got the Bestbuy guys on the job. Now from my perspective I had gone into the store to pay $1100 on the 32\" version with 120MHZ so I though this is no brainer. Well this brings me back to the condition of the unit. It had tape residue all over it (not the screen) but the outer edges on the front and back. My thoughts were, it is the PQ that I am buying and not the cosmetics and I was fully confident that I could handle the cosmetic hurdle. Well this morning (the morning after) I proceeded to gather my cleaning tools that I thought would best do the job.1. Mineral Oil2. Screen Cleaner3. Mystery CleanerWell I pulled up my office chair to this red beauty in the rough and dabbed a few drops of mineral oil on a fiber cloth and began to wipe the tape residue off the top and back of the unit. This seems to work ok but it was not efficient and it was greasy. After I got most of the residue off I cleaned the plastic with the screen cleaner to try and remove any of the residual oil. Once again it seemed to work ok but it was going to take longer than expected. I had a lot of tape to remove. Why they do this I do not know.Here is where the mystery cleaner comes into play.I own a Jeep Rubicon and Jeep owners have long had a need for something to clean the plastic windows on the soft top.I had ready to go to see if the result were more efficient.I thought well I will give it a shot on the next patch of tape.As i started to wipe over the next batch of tape residue I noticed that it was coming right off with very little effort and applying a nice shine in the process almost like I was waxing the back of the 650a.I was so happy to come to the realization that this was going to be alot easier than I thought. I continued to clean the rest of the 650a with the mystery cleaner till it looked close to brand new.After I was done I thought this product is awesome.I have also used it to clean my wife's laptop lid and a Dell Mini 9. As well as the remote that came with this display model.This mystery product is called:Plexus ([...])DO NOT USE THIS ON THE SCREEN!!!!!Only use it on the frame.So thanks to a very nice couple who saved me an extra $100 and Plexus plastic cleaner I believe I came out pretty good paying $999 for a floor model that looks very close to being new and I get an additional 8 inches  of screen for $100 less than the 32\".I am very happy.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Simply Amazing", "Author": "WOWaddict", "ReviewID": "R2UVW20MDZ1YTK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't believe how wonderful this TV is.

These are on every television but on most televisions, 99.9% of the time they are off-screen and you never see them.

I have the TV hanging on my wall now, and I am writing this review using my computer that is hooked up to it. This review is about Amazon and the shipping that I received.June 27th - I order the TV.June 30th - Amazon ships the TV.June 30th to July 5th - TV goes from Cincinnati, OH, to Columbus, OH.Somewhere between July 5th and July 13th - TV gets lost in shipping between Columbus and Los Angeles.That was the summary. Now for a bit more detail.I ordered the TV on June 27th, to which they took 3 days to actually get it shipped out. Ok, no big deal, should be here in maybe 5-7 days. 5-7 days later it has shipped a grand total of 95 miles. An average of 14 or so miles a day; I could probably carry it that fast. On July 2nd, CEVA (the shipping company) called me to tell me I should be receiving it on July 7th - NICE! July 7th comes around and I get no call by mid afternoon, so I call them. They haven't received the TV in Los Angeles yet (250 miles south of where I am), and that they are scheduled to receive it on the 7th in LA, have it shipped to the third party company on the 8th, and I will have it on the 9th. Tuesday the 8th, I call them to make sure that their story was straight, and the woman tells me they have it in LA, and it's going to the third party shipping, and I will have it on Wednesday, the 9th (same story I got before). Wednesday the 9th, and I haven't gotten a call by mid afternoon. I call CEVA, they say they never recieved the TV in LA, and that it's supposed to come in to LA on Wednesday, ship to third party shipper on Thursday, and I will receive it on Friday, the 11th. Ugh, ok - it was free shipping, I guess I get what I pay for. I call on Thursday to verify their story again, and again the woman says they haven't received it in LA. Lets keep in mind, it's now the 10th of July (past the day Amazon estimated I would get it), and I ordered it on the 27th. CEVA doesn't know where the TV is, and they have a specialist looking for it.So, CEVA doesn't know where it is, and I have no idea when I'll get it, all the meantime Amazon already has my money.I call CEVA on Friday, and a woman tells me the exact times that it was scanned in at LAX, and that it was on it's way to the third party shipper to come up North where I am, I will receive it on Sunday. I call Sunday to verify, and the SAME woman tells me that they don't deliver on Sundays, and my time window is 1PM to 5PM on Monday (today). UGH, ok, finally I'm getting it. Wait, my phone is ringing. CEVA, 20 minutes after I got off the phone with this woman, is calling to tell me that they don't know where the TV is and that it's lost, and to call Amazon for a replacement. This sucks.I call Amazon for a replacement, and they tell me that they can't ship it quickly, that it's going to go through the same shipping company, and that it will take 7-10 business days. Screw that, canceled my order, refund of money. Went to best buy and spent $200 dollars more on it total (I get a corporate discount through the company I work for, plus it was on sale). I can't say any less for the quality of shipping, and professionalism of the customer service by a company that represents Amazon.As for the TV, it's EXACTLY what I was expecting - amazing. It's exactly what I wanted in every aspect. Works great in every way that I have used it thus far. 5/5 star for TV, 0/5 star for Amazon/CEVA.Sorry for length, like the title says, Amazon did not deliver, literally. /end rant.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Top quality TV", "Author": "Peter V.

Everyone seems wider- even skinny Teri Hatcher looks chunky...And, the HD channels are such a ripoff!! the actual image gets even smaller. Besides, I can't seem to distinguish the difference between the regular and the HD channels. I think, I actually like the picture on the reg. channels better...The menu is very cumbersome and way too elaborate for simple functions.", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0014175NE"}}
