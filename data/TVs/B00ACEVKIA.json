Vogt", "ReviewID": "R351T5W1ADRJN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall if you were lucky to get one of these during the black friday deals , it really is a spectacular TV for the price. While it does not have some of the adjustments and detail of the more expensive brands, Overall after some minor adjustments in the settings menu the HDMI performance is really very nice. Super light weight as well. The TV is actually made by Funai. One of the key things to getting the best picture is to turn off the ambient light sensor in the advanced settings, and turn the backlight to about 18 in the settings.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV for less than $300", "Author": "Vinoth Selvaraj", "ReviewID": "R11NARZFOA4ZDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this during Black Friday sales in 2012 in walmart for less than $300.  I never heard of the 'Emerson' brand before. I was really hesitating to buy it and then decided to give a try thinking of returning it immediately if i did not like it. Now i have this TV for more than a year.After using this TV daily for a year, I am really happy that i bought this TV instead of spending more money on other costly brands.Pros:-----50 inch - price is  < $300.Picture is very sharp and clear.Surprisingly sound is very good than 40 inch Samsung LED TV my friend has.Has 4 HDMI inputs & 1 USB inputCons:-----TV remote looks cheap  --> But works fine so far so not an issue.TV is very heavy. Requires 2 persons to move. --> How often we are going to move a TV. so not an issue.5.1 Sound Bar:--------------This TV has Coaxial audio output. I bought a 'VIZIO S4251w-B4 5.1 Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer and Satellite Speakers' recently. I was able to connect it to this TV directly using coaxial cable to get true 5.1 audio. It sounds much much better now.Summary:--------It was an awesome deal to get a 50inch TV for $300. Other reviews of this TV might say that it did not work/last long etc. you can see similar complaints in other costly TV brands as well. If you are not a tech savvy / do not have a lot of expectations from a TV, then go for it. You will not be disappointed.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price!", "Author": "Jeff \"VisionaryUrbanTactics\"", "ReviewID": "RS5EOJ0KZT4P4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Scored this TV at Walmart a couple days ago during Black Friday.
