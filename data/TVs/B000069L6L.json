{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One word...WOW", "Author": "\"greatone222\"", "ReviewID": "R292N4RT7WJMZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shopped for a new 36 inch TV for 2 weeks. I went out to 4 different stores and looked at all the new models, from JVC, to Panasonic, to sony WEGA and XBR. I finally decided on THIS TV. The Model # is Fv300. This is the 2nd model down, (below HDTV) in the WEGA 36 inch line. The features such as infared headphones, picture in picture, \"WoW\" sony simulated surround sound, and a 3D DIGITAL COMB, as opposed to 3 line digital, which appears in almost all average price TV's. The 3D Digital does make a difference, and only beging in WEGA in the Fv300. There are two S video connectors (1 rear, 1 front), and plenty of A/V jacks in the rear (19 of them). Heres the catch, the stand. It cost me 219.00 bucks. Im not sure how much you can find it for, but that is the proper WEGA stand, custom made by SONY for this TV. Let me say...it is one SOLID stand and LOOKS like its worth over 200 dollars. It really does make the presentation. The cheapest quality stand you could find will still run between 99.99 and 169.99 anyway. So I suggest doing as I did, and just going for it. Another issue is the weight of this thing. It's easily 240lbs, some websites claim its more. If you plan on taking this home, your gonna need someone with an SUV or a truck, the box is enormous. I would suggest getting it delivered so you can have them put it right on the stand for you. Me and my brother are weightlifters, so we didnt have too much of a problem getting it in and on the stand , but I would suggest ATLEAST 3 strong people. All the weight is in the front, too. When your past all the setting up, your gonna be happy with your TV. The audio out connection is easy for a home theatre system. I connected a Sony system, and Im attempting to dual connect Klipsch 5.1's. So youve read about the TV, what are the differences in the different models of 36 inch WEGA? FS100- basic model, cheapest, no PIP, No 3d digital comb, No Tru surround sound...basically lacks important features.FS200- Adds PIP, and other basic features, but very similar to the FS100.FV300- This is the model I bought. PIP, 3D digital comb, free infared headphones (which allow you to listen to TV from a distance), etc etc etc...it's loaded.FV500- HDTV model, includes all features of the Fv300, but adds the somewhat \"gimmicky\" HDTV feature. It looks nice but you'll need an HDTV sattalite connection, or some other form to use it. ALso, not all stations broadcast HDTV. It is TV of the future, but its not here yet. Save the 500 bucks. Sony XBR- A step above WEGA, HDTV capable, and 40 inch. Runs double the price of the FV300.Ok, I just wanted to provide you with some insite after my purchase. I'm happy with the Fv300, and I know I made the right choice. Cant beat SONY, Trinitron, and WEGA all in one. I've got two trinitron computer monitors and I was SOLD on the TV just as quickly. They are the best.", "Date": "November 24, 2002"}, {"Title": "a great buy", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3HHVF8WAXKGUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited 8 months for last year's $1699 Sony 36 inch TV to go on close out sale.  It finally did, *but* then I saw the new model.  Better picture - a truely amazing picture.  And, imo, much better styling - not that clunky old dark grey box that most TVs have.  Once my wife and I saw shows on the regular cable (non-digital) signal, we couldn't get over how sharp and clear and bright it is.  Popped in a couple of old VCR tapes, and the difference between the new picture and that on our couple of years old Sony 27 inch, in terms of clarity and brightness, was amazing.Couldn't be happier!", "Date": "June 27, 2002"}, {"Title": "An owner's opinion...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2CO1S1M9WQVJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are extremely happy that we purchased this TV. I can't say enough good things about the KV-36FV300.The picture quality is outstanding. The filtering creates an image that will amaze you. Lines of resolution are almost unnoticeable and dot-crawl is minimal. We hooked up our digital cable with S-Video and the picture is excellent. I even saw a hint of pixelization during movement on one of the digital channels. This is of no concern because we don't have the HD converter box, but that shows how close this set comes to HDTV.Used the component hook-up for our DVD player. WOW!!! You can get buy with S-Video here but you'll not acheive what this TV can do for you. (Pay a little extra for the component cables!) Sony allows you to select either a 16x9 enhanced mode or Auto for widescreen dvd's and I've found the auto mode allows a bigger picture in widescreen with no sacrafice in picture quality. There are multiple sound and video modes fore each input to tailor each program, so you don't have to mess with settings constantly. Once you get the Clear Edge VM (velocity modulation) and the DynaBlack settings set the TV never stops blowing you away.The sound is impressive! It has a 15-watt subwoofer for deep bass when using just the tv speakers, but I prefer my Yamaha theatre system most of the time. The wireless headphones were a nice surprise! The quality is better than expected but the range is limited. These are great for watching those late night games when everyone's asleep. (sports fans, are you awake?)TV broadcasts through cable, particularly live sports, are simply outstanding. DVD signals are even better!!! And you can't find better sound from a TV anywhere else.Unless you want to struggle with an HDTV (at least until analog signals are outlawed),  BUY THIS TV!!!!!!!!!(Advice: ...have it delivered, it's worth the money.)

The volume alone can go up and be as good as any sound system. We play Rock Band II at concert level on this TV and it handles it quite smoothly.I purchased this wonderful Picture-in-Picture TV in 2005. With HiDef taking over, it is a very bitter sweet purchase for me. Oh well...it is the best of a dying breed.4 stars because although it is a great TV it weighs over 200lbs and is not HiDef.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Trinitron Wega flat screen minimizes distortion for sharp images\nDynaBlack technology delivers optimal contrast\n3-D digital comb filter enhances resolution by removing the blurred edges between colors\nTruSurround stereo provide theater-style audio\n2-tuner picture-in-picture", "Name": "Sony 36\" Flat-Screen TV With 2-Tuner PIP (KV-36FV300)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BAWN61K8L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000069L6L"}}
