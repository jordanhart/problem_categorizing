{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally, a cute TV! And it works well, too.", "Author": "Laurel Krahn", "ReviewID": "ROCW3R63JVTCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV a couple of months ago for my office; it's the perfect size for the smallish room and it really is beautiful. I wish there were more TVs available that came in fun colors and shapes, not just for kids, but adults like myself too.  When I went searching for a TV that wasn't black, I remembered Hannspree from their cute TVs for kids years ago as well as their sets with MLB team logos. Was so pleased to see that they now have LCD TVs, though I wish they had more designs.  I hope they add more styles and sizes to their lineup soon. Fortunately this TV works perfectly in my turquoise and red office.A few things you might want to know that aren't necessarily covered in the description:I was disappointed that the remote control that came with the set is basic black-- I'd hoped for a fun remote that went with the theme of the set or at least a remote that was red or green or even white to match it.  It seems to be a universal remote that can operate at least four devices (it has device buttons for DVD, Audio, Cable, and TV) and is decent as remotes go though we've only used it with the TV; the buttons for the non-TV options like Fast Forward are fairly small and not what I'd want to use regularly for a DVR or DVD player.  Not backlit.  Given this is a TV marketed to kids, I'm surprised it didn't come with a simple kid-friendly remote or that Hannspree doesn't sell remotes meant for kids as an optional accessory.Another thing of note, especially if you're using the set in a small room in a quiet house-- the lowest volume setting isn't as quiet as it could be.  We've had it set on \"1\" and wished we could make it quieter.  Granted, we have good ears and are sitting very close (within 10 feet or so) to the set, but I figured it worth mentioning.  Depending on the source of what we're watching, we've had the volume set all the way down (1) or about halfway up the volume scale. We've only used it with the built-in speakers which seem fine for the casual viewing we do in that room, but then I'm no audiophile.I've successfully connected a laptop computer to it (an older MacBook Pro) via HDMI, a Roku (also via HDMI), a Blu-Ray player (HDMI), and an external antenna and it's worked well with all of those sources. (There are only two HDMI inputs, I didn't have all three connected at once.)  Haven't done any serious gaming with the set yet.  Have watched baseball and football on it and both looked excellent in HD without any artifacts. Works well enough with the computer I could see using it as a large monitor for your computer if you needed one that size.The screen isn't glossy and we've had no problems with glare even in our small room with multiple windows and lamps.I also like the way the inputs are labeled on the back of the set and how they're somewhat concealed by having the holes/ports face down.There is a light on the front of the set next to the Hannspree logo above the row of buttons which is green when the set is on and red when the set is off.  I imagine if the light bugs you (say, if you're sleeping near the set or something and like things really dark), you could probably put a bit of tape over the light.  Or use a timer or power strip or something to turn off all power to the set (or just unplug it).  The light does help you find the power button easily enough and slightly illuminates the three buttons below it (Menu, Input, and Power).  We do appreciate the number of buttons on the set for when we misplace the remote (or are sitting close enough it's easier just to adjust things on the set).It's easy to change inputs and the button for that is right at the top of the remote or you can use the one on the set.  The menu is fairly simple. It has preset picture modes for Vivid, Standard, and Movie . . . or you can tweak the individual screen settings yourself.  There are options for Digital Noise Reduction (Off, Weak, Medium, Strong).  Aspect Ratio options:  Full, Normal, Zoom, Subtitle, Auto, Zoom-1, and Wide.  Screen Mode:  Auto, Video, or PC.  Audio presets are Dynamic, Standard, Soft or you can tweak the equalizer settings yourself.  Audio select:  HDMI or PC Line In.  On Screen Display time options: 10 secs, 20 secs, 30 secs, or 60 secs.  Sleep timer settings:  off, 15 mins, 30 mins, 45 mins, 60 mins, 90 mins, 120 mins.  There is an energy saving mode.  I haven't messed with it but there are \"recall\" options in both the video and audio menus.The packaging kept the set in good shape and I don't recall it being especially annoying or that it was at all hard to remove the set from the box and set it up.I've watched stuff on the set daily for the last couple of months and have no complaints.  And the set really is ridiculously cute, but not painfully cutesy, if that makes sense.  Some electronics gear I've seen that goes the cute route or is marketed for kids seems poorly made or too childish (even for some kids I know)-- this set isn't like that.  Not every adult would want a TV that looks like an apple, but if you're the sort who wants one, it's a set you can display proudly and it looks like it will last a long time-- I kinda love mine.  Now if only I could find a Blu-Ray player to match it . . .", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just needs standby mode", "Author": "C.

But once I set it up I was so conflicted.Shaped like a huge big red apple complete with 2 leaves and a stalk, I thought it will be more appropriate for my grand-kids' room.  Its shape, beautiful as it is, is hard to match with ordinary \"adult\" furniture.  On the other hand, it has an AMAZING picture quality, the best I have ever seen!  Probably even better than my 1080p 60 \" Sony Bravia.  I wanted to watch my shows on this TV.  How amazing?  Watching the MLB game, you can see the individual blades of grass!  Plus, the sound is far better, with 10W speakers, than most other LCD TVs.It has a myriad of connections, probably for every possible device you can think of.  I thought it would make a terrific monitor for my computer.In the end, however, I decided to put it in kids' room.  They absolutely LOVE it!  But when the kids are not around, I watch my shows there on this amazing Hannspree TV.One little negative.  The remote is obviously meant to control multiple devices but there are no instructions on how to program it to control DVD player etc.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome and Beautiful!!", "Author": "Nikole", "ReviewID": "R3SYJEM9J9QVPI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv just fits in!
