{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great PQ, but HORRIBLE (delayed) brightness fluctuations", "Author": "jimmienoman", "ReviewID": "RUCDNM4CD2DQS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "To preface this I have had 2 P50ST30s (one replacement because of the problems I will talk about below) and Amazon was awesome with the whole return and replacement. One of the best companies I have dealt with. This is a very long review as I would like you to understand what you are buying beforehand.ALL VERSIONS OF PANASONIC 2011 TVs ARE EXHIBITING THIS PROBLEM.I was excited when I first set up my TV and took the time to age the phosphors in the TV for 150 hours by running slides (a step that can be skipped but the phosphors degrade in the first 100 hours faster than the rest of it's life). I set up the blu-ray player and after dialing in the settings it looked awesome. Then the brightness fluctuations happened.The best way I can explain brightness fluctuations ( Fluctuating Brightness or FBr) is will be a leap in lighting. When you have a dark scene the whole picture will darken some to give more detail to a shadowed area. It is necessary to give great picture quality in any plasma. Normally what will happen is that it will gradually fade into darker or lighter, this TV does it all in one step. A drastic comparison would be a pitch black room where you turn a light on vs turning a dimmer light on gradually. What you see on the screen is picture that will switch from dark to lighter. It is most noticeable when you have 2 scenes switching back and forth (think dialogue between 2 characters where it switches between ones face to the other) and one scene is darker than the other. You can easily see this in the movie Hereafter around minute 40.This problem is exacerbated by a delay in the video processing of the switch between darker scenes and lighter scenes. In almost all video they will have scenes cut and pasted together. When this happens the lighting usually will change for various reasons. When the scenes cut from one to another this TV will take about 0.5-1 second to process the lighting difference to adjust to give more detail to shadowed areas. Given that it does it in one leap as mentioned above, it severely distracts you from watching the movie and enjoying it.Darker Movies will usually bring out these symptoms to it's max. When I went to watch Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, I came to the point where I started counting the fluctuations instead of watching the movie. I counted 56 total in one watching. My wife didn't watch HP with me but she commented on it while watching Castle a few times, then more and more on other shows.The reviews are definitely favorable as it has a great picture quality without doubt. Most professional reviewers mention fluctuating brightness problem, but gloss over it. Why they did I am not sure. It seems that some sets show this dramatically, while others don't. My first one (the one I counted 56 fluctuations on for HP) I would say was very bad compared to a slightly less worse one that I got the second time around. I re watched HP on the second one to see if I could just enjoy the movie, got to the point I started counting again and only counter 32 which were more tame but still easy to spot without even looking for them. To make sure it just wasn't me seeing things because I knew when they were, I made (yes she wasn't to happy about it) her watch Tron with me. We first started Tron in 2d and she saw it some; then I popped in the 3d disc and she was pointing it out in every other scene.I placed a complaint with US Panasonic as this was unacceptable, trying to explain it the best as I am now. I was walked through changing multiple settings (CATS off, trying all modes, changing contrast and all other settings, using 3 different HDMI cables along with composite and component cables) with nothing relieving the issue. Their response was that this is a feature of the TV and that it was working properly. Some of their exact words in the email I later received were \" the picture dimming (fluctuating brightness) is negligible and should be considered within the TV's design specification.\"In Spain a gentleman Documented this for Panasonic to prove that something was wrong. If you would like to see how bad this is; there has been a video posted by a member of a great forum for high def junkies that shows this instance (Google \" VT30 hereafter \" and it will show in the youtube vids) if you would like to see exactly what I am talking about. The TV here was the VT series which is Panasonic's flagship model and cost well over $1,200 of this TV.Since the posting of the above video Spain got a firmware update to 1.520. The same person posted the exact same scene with the same setup which you can also view by clicking on his name or clicking on it on the right hand side. It eliminates this problem, since then Europe Panasonic have acknowledged that there is something that they are looking into (circumventing saying there is a problem). But US Panasonic calls this a feature that is working as intended. Unlike US Panasonic which I have opened 2 cases with them about this problem, one for both TVs, and just receive it's a feature of the TV which is working properly...I am hoping that this is heeded as a warning to many as I feel terrible about Amazon being outstanding in it's Customer Service trying to rectify what is obviously not their fault. I am a man that researches any large purchase to the T to try to avoid these problems. I weighed my options and since the professional reviewers either made no mention of this problem or said it was a minor problem; I decided to buy this Panasonic. I post this in hopes that those that do their research won't feel gypped as I do.If you would like to read more comments a Facebook page was created in hope that it would have an effect as it did with Sony. It is on facebook under \"My 2011 Panasonic TV is Defective\".UPDATE 7/26 : Various Panasonic emails have said that there will be an announcement this Wednesday 7/27. Also a A reliable higher up in Panasonic NA has said that there is a FW that will be aimed at fixing \"panel dimming\" very soon (this term has a different meaning then Fluctuating Brightness, but all other FW fixes in Europe that fixed the FBr were released to fix another problem). This could or could not be a fix to the above problems, but hopefully putting 2 and 2 together means we will be getting a FW fix this Wednesday. Whether this is a fix to the above problems or not remains to be seen. Since I published this report it has been confirmed that all European models are now shipped with the Firmware that fixes FBr, while here in NA it hasn't been addressed. Here is to hoping for a statement Wednesday.*UPDATE* 8/6/11 : First there has been no true announcement from Panasonic NA as of yet. But after getting all the data collected and sent forward to the engineers (yes many people that owned the TV put in this work), the engineers were able to replicate the problem. Since then there is now a patch. This is not a Firmware update, instead it changes other \"software\" in the TV like the EEPROM. Since it is not strictly a Firmware update they cannot simply have your tv download it from the internet like normal. It REQUIRES, at least as of right now, a tech to come out to install it on your TV.Note that this fix has been confirmed to be loaded on TVs coming from the factory now. When this change occurred I cannot tell you neither can anyone that you can talk to, so please do not hound amazon, Panasonic or any other retailer. I assume the earliest we will see TVs with this update will be very late July produced TVs if not August. If you decide to buy a TV from Amazon please just allow them to come out and patch the TV instead of sending it back. If you send it back Amazon has to eat the shipping and this is one company that tries it's hardest to help the customer. So please do not make them eat the cost or else they WILL eventually have to change the policies they have. It may take a few weeks to get the rep out, butit is worth it to allow amazon to keep its very lax and customer happiness driven CS.Now onto the results :I have had this patch on my TVs for 2 days now. I compiled a list of FBr material that was bad during the data collection phase before we passed this on to the Panasonic Engineers so I had a list prepared to test this afterward to see if it was fixed or not. Running through 20 of the worst scenes over 6 movies (Harry Potter Deathly Hallows 1, Tron, Casino Royale, Hereafter, Battlefield LA). In these movies I saw not 1 noticeable FBr ( I say noticeable because FBr is in the driving mechanism of this TV). I noticed only 1 instance of a small FBr in the movie The Rite, but it was under extreme circumstances (dark background to near white background with a shadowed face in a scene change). Besides that I also watched some streamed video (Master Chef, True Blood, Band of Brothers etc) and got the same results of no FBr. Gaming (Fallout 3, Dragon Age Origins and Gears of War 2) was also the same, no FBr.Overall it fixed the problem almost completely, if not completely. This patch surpassed my expectations and Panasonic owned up and fixed a glaring problem. There have been 3 forum users that have this fix and posted about it. They all report the same thing.If you have purchased this TV or any other Panasonic NA ST30, GT30 or VT30 and have the problems mentioned above please call 1-800-973-4390. This is Panasonic Concierge and this is the number that was requested to call by the engineers. Tell them you have Fluctuating Brightness. Low end techs have been sent a memo regarding this. Many are now receiving emails to set up appointments.Because of this fix I have amended my score of the TV. For this price this TV is amazing. I reserved 5 stars for the Pioneer Kuro (the gold standard), 4 1/2 stars for the VT series and dk8000. This TV 4 stars is an undervaluation, but it is all I can do on here. Honestly it would be 4.25 taking into account the above TVs superiority. I cannot express how happy I am with this TV now that it is fixed.****UPDATE 8/22/11****They have a limited amount of panasonic qualified techs that can install the update via SD card and will NOT give out the SD card for local non-panasonic techs to install as it has proprietary software on it. To alleviate the problem they send a new a-board to local techs that has the patch preloaded. The tech can then come out and install the new a-board under warranty claim (all free to you).It is a simple procedure and only takes 15 minutes. This a-board replacement doesn't void any warranty as it is done by Panasonic under Panasonic's warranty by a qualified tech.*WARNING* the a-board swap AND the SD patch will wipe your calibration and the ISF day/night mode (ISF day/night is only available if you have the TV calibrated and the tech turns it on in the Service menu), if you had one done. If you decide to do either of the fixes I would suggest buying a backup program (like controlcal) to save your settings. You can then reload them after the patch. It has been noted by calibrators that after either of the fixes that you will get close to the same results with the old calibration, but they say you will need a touchup to gray scale and colors to be as accurate as possible.From good sources it has been said that any August build TVs should have the fix pre-installed. Unfortunately the build date isn't on the outside of the box in the US. There is another way to check if it has been factory installed though. The 3-6 numbers in the serial number designate whether it has been fixed or not. These 4 numbers need to be 1215 or higher for the fix to be pre-installed. It will look like : xx1215xxxxxx .Again if you order from Amazon, or any other online type store, they have no direct control on what comes out of the warehouse and you CANNOT request that it is an August build as they have no control on what goes out. If you want to be sure of what you get, you should buy local and specifically state you will only buy it if it meets those criteria.The fix is easy enough to get that you should feel comfortable ordering this product. Don't order this product and expect a 1215. Instead order this product expecting to have the tech come out. You may get a set pre 1215 that has no FBr as about 50% of the people report that they have no problem without the patch or you may get a 1215 build, but you should go into it expecting what you will most likely get. Then anything else is a bonus. If you don't feel good about buying the TV and possibly getting a FBr one then I suggest not buying from online stores.To those outside of the US. Panasonic divisions are completely separate as they use different components, different firmware etc so this fix is for US only. The US division is sharing this info with EU, Canada, Australia etc to try to get this problem fixed with those TVs also. The other countries are still in the beginning stages so don't expect them to be exactly where the US is as the other countries have to test, document, confirm, create a fix (using different components/software mean they just can't copy/paste the US fix to theirs) and then test the fix. I cannot give you an update on outside of US, but I would suggest that you make your voice heard by opening tickets and speaking out about the problem.Lastly for those that do have the TV or those that are willing to buy the TV and get the fix after. Call up Panasonic Concierge at 1-800-973-4390 . Allow them to walk you through the steps they have and try them as it is possible that it could fix your problem. If they walk you through that and you still see the FBr they should have received info on how to push it to the next level. To make sure here is the Document that they can look up regarding this issue :Service Hint ('A' Board replacement to fix the 'brightness fluctuation\" in the ST30/GT30/VT30).SH-B34-11-03-REVA majority of this info is me simply condensing what many others have done to get this in place. Thanks go to the great people of highdefjunkies.com especially 3 in particular, D-Nice for his initial findings and universal knowledge; AVjunkie and Gotchaa who helped consolidate/voice our problems to the techs.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be happier", "Author": "Vin", "ReviewID": "R3VCR4HXSQ2JS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like everyone else interested in making the big screen purchase, I spent hours every night reading reviews, shopping around, comparing specs and prices, and trying to decide whether I should go lcd or plasma. Ultimately, I ended up just going to the local BB and seeing which one looked and felt right to me. I purchased this beautiful 55in plasma and I couldn't be happier about it. I've had it for over two weeks now and I don't have a single complaint. The picture is great and the sound is just fine for my living space(apartment). The 2D-3D conversion is alright but you should not expect much from any television's conversion. The 3D Blu-Ray is a different story - The Ultimate Wave Tahiti is AMAZING (I had to watch it twice because I didn't follow a word because I was so blown away by the picture) and Resident Evil Afterlife was fun to watch (the 3D at least).I realized that all the hours I spent reading super detailed reviews was somewhat a waste of time because when it comes down to it, I don't really care about or even notice the subtle differences that so many people compare. I just wanted a solid tv with great picture at an affordable price and this was it.The setup was beyond easy. The remote and on-screen menus are very user-friendly.The widgets all work just fine. Watching youtube videos on a 55in can be entertaining.My roommate and I are traveling surfers and licensed skydivers so we have plenty of GoPro HD videos that we watch on this tv using the SD card slot(we also watch them through the youtube widget)and they look phenomenal.BOTTOM LINE: If you want a solid big screen with great picture at the right price then this is it. Highly recommend.

This was my first step into the wonderful world of plasma tv's & I have nothing but praise for it.  I recently decided that I wanted to squeeze the largest tv I could fit into my entertainment armoire & considering how much I loved my old tv I figured it was a safe bet to stick with the Panasonic brand.Immediately after turning the st30 on & popping in Planet Earth on Blu Ray for a test run I was extremely happy with both the new size of screen in front of me & the fantastic picture quality.  I played around some more, tweaking the picture & features on my new set & decided to start watching some of my select Blu Rays that don't have letterboxing.  I read somewhere that it's best to watch movies that take up the whole screen for the first 100 hours or so of a new plasma.  I'm no tech head so I just do what I'm told.  :pNot long into watching \"Starship Troopers\" I noticed my first flicker, or fluctuation.  Every time the film made a cut there was an adjustment in brightness that came a half second later.  I began rewinding it over & over & couldn't believe my eyes.  After the awful flickering in the beginning I continued to watch & noticed it happening throughout, though not as bad as the start of the film.  I've watched a few movies since then, such as - Sin City (noticeable but not terrible), LotR Fellowship of the Ring (noticeable but not terrible), & OH MY GOD Final Fantasy: Advent Children.  Final Fantasy was just unwatchable with flickering all over the place.  For those who don't know, Final Fantasy is entirely computer animated which might have something to do with it being so noticeable.  I would expect the Pixar films to behave just as poorly but I can't say for certain.I started researching & discovered that the fluctuating brightness (or \"FBr\") is not an unusual phenomenon.  Just google \"panasonic fluctuating brightness\" & read up on it.  The forum \"high def junkies\" is a good place to start as they have been discussing it in depth for a while.I haven't lost all hope yet!  There has been talk of Panasonic sending out a firmware upgrade to their Spanish customers on a case-by-case basis that actually FIXES this problem!  Or at least adjusts it so the fluctuation isn't visible to the naked eye.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this firmware makes it stateside so I can begin enjoying my tv.  If that happens I will definitely change my rating of 1 to a 5 star.  I'll be keeping my eye on that 30-day return date in the meantime, however.********EDIT**************After emailing Panasonic & starting a case with them I waited patiently for an email or a phone call, but after a month none came.  I kept up with the community on high def junkies & eventually discovered that Panasonic had started sending local repair guys out with a new A-Board, or if you're one of the lucky few a much simpler fix was available if a Panasonic employee could come to your house.  I called Panasonic to see what the status on my case was, only to find out they had closed my case without any kind of notification.  Jerks.  The person I spoke with on the phone was apologetic & knew exactly what I was talking about when I brought up fluctuating brightness.  I was FINALLY getting somewhere.  Within a week of that phone call they sent the replacement A-Board to my local repair shop & I had an \"FBr\" free tv!For those curious, they did have to take apart my tv.  After watching that terrifying ordeal it was just a simple unplug-this plug-in-that & they were done.  VERY happy overall.After the fix this is easily a 5-star tv in my book.  I'm a little conflicted on showering it with nothing but praise, however.  I didn't exactly buy this tv day-1 of it's release & it took them this long to even acknowledge there was a terrible defect in a large number of their sets.For those few who complain about picture quality I will agree that right out of the box the picture quality doesn't really jump out at you, but after buying a calibration disc & tweaking the custom settings it really looks amazing.  Easily the best in its price range.In short - if you're on the fence about this set, don't be.  If you're unlucky & get one that was built before they had this fix installed, Panasonic will handle it!", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beats every TV out there for the price. Blows away LED/LCD!", "Author": "D. DePanicis", "ReviewID": "R2XU3UA7RTFU3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As with most guys buying a new expensive electronic toy I did weeks worth of research on TV's.  My previous TV was a 2007 Samsung plasma (720p) and I really loved it for the time that I had it but I was intrigued by the new LED line of TV's.  Before doing research I thought that this was the future and that plasmas were going to be phased out but I soon found out this is not the case.  In fact LED TV's are no more than LCD TV's with LED backlighting while true LED's (OLED) being thousands of dollars for 42\" models and scarce availability.Regardless I went out and bought what I felt was a bargain, a 60\" Sharp Aquos Quattron 60LE832U from BJ's for $1,799.  It was thin, had wireless connectivity built in, 60\", and cheap for what you got.  The picture was good but I soon noticed a lot of artifacts in the picture.  The color from the factory was overly bright and oversaturated.  I am usually one who likes a slightly less realistic picture in favor of slightly more saturated and vivid images too but this was over the top.  No matter what I could not get the picture quality right and there were definitely motion issues even with the claimed 240Hz aquamotion.  Turns out it isn't truly 240Hz and it suffers from the same motion issues that all LCD's are plagued with.  Frustrated I looked over to the plasma side but was apprehensive because in the store plasmas always look horrible.  Their pictures are dull and over-brightened to where the blacks look gray and they are always next to shiny LED/LCD's that look so good.  I had enough in my account to grab a second TV thankfully to see what it looked like next to the Sharp and figured I would take back the one that looked worse.  In this case I was losing 5\" in picture and was worried that the ambient light in my living room would drown out the plasma picture because this had always been a problem with plasma.The second I hooked up this TV I was blown away!  The color even out of the box was breathtaking and the blacks were spot on.  There was a golf tournament on and I felt like I was there looking through a window.  The Sharp had good resolution but it felt fake since the picture was so bright (even when turned down) and the motion unrealistic.  I immediately packed up the Sharp and took it back.  I am telling you if you are thinking of LED/LCD don't do it, plasma is where it's at and you cannot beat the picture on this TV for the price, it is unbelievable!!!  LED/LCD just hasn't been perfected enough which is why there are so many different types such as edge-lit, full array, etc.I do want to mention for those of you looking to get this TV that I highly recommend you break the TV in for the first 100 hours by not displaying any static images such as logos or game HUD's.  I also recommend running the slides that can be found here:[...] for the first 100 hours of the TV to age the phosphors in the TV evenly.  The best way to do this is to put these slides on an SD card and run them through media player making sure to run the slideshow on loop mode and continuously.  This allows each pixel to age at the exact same rate so that after the 100 hours each pixel has the same color saturation.  Early on phosphors are soft and get hotter than normal, making them more susceptible to burn in and image retention but as they age they harden and their colors become more normalized.  After this time burn in is less of an issue and your TV will calibrate much better as each pixel has a normalized color to the one next to it. The best settings for the TV can be found here: [...]Issues-Thread but must not be used until AFTER the 100 hour break in time!  Remember not to use vivid mode for the first 100 hours either as this can increase chance of image retention although on newer TV's it isn't as much of an issue anymore.Now on to the actual review:Pros:1) Picture quality - Absolutely stunning, the picture is as realistic as it comes with good saturation and the brightness is perfect.  I have put this TV next to everything out there include the GT30 and VT30 and there is absolutely no different from what my eyes can see.  All you get is THX mode and 1 HDMI and USB port on the other models and anyone who tells you the PQ is better on those is just being overly critical and properly a complete calibration nut because I just can't see it nor can most people.2) Black levels - Any deeper of a black and it would look fake, even when the brightness is turned up they stay completely black, it isn't not a stupid balancing act like it is with LED/LCD where you have to tradeoff black levels for other things like brightness.3) Internet apps/connectivity/networking - Comes with a wireless dongle to allow connection to your network and it is much more useful than I thought.  DLNA works 1000x better than the Sharp which was clunky, slow, and didn't play all media types.  The ST30 even previews your video files on your network as you are scrolling through them, it is a very cool feature and is very responsive.  The apps are great too with pretty much everything you would be looking for such as Pandora and Youtube.4) Price - As I mentioned before you cannot beat this PQ for the price.  $1499 at most places and it can even be found a tad cheaper.  The Vizio 4SV 55\" model is almost $2000 and is large, ugly, and has a myriad of problems such as randomly turning off.  This is a documented problem that you can search for and Vizio is apprehensive to fix it for anyone.5) 3D - I'll admit I wasn't really big on this and the Sharp I bought didn't even have it because I could care less about it but this one did (and was cheaper, go figure).  I am really glad now that it does have it as the 3D is simply breathtaking and there is little to no crosstalk at all!  All the other makers (except maybe Sony) had a lot of crosstalk, especially Samsung.  The Sony I viewed had great 3D but it was also running on a demo in the store hooked to a bluray which is a bit deceiving compared to watching it on DirecTV or something.  Also be aware that Vizio TV's are not listed (right now) as a supported 3DTV with DirecTV!Cons:1) Only con I can think of is that the 60\" model is almost $600 more, which is a bit ridiculous.  I was hoping it was more like $300 more as I probably would have jumped on it if so.2) Nothing else, this TV absolutely rocks!Bottom line:If you are on the fence with which TV to get or you are debating plasma vs. LED/LCD please take this review seriously and try the plasma, I am almost going to guarantee that for this price that you are going to like it more.  The new Samsung 55\" LED/LCD is $2650, while this amazing 2011 plasma is $1499, no need to spend $1200 more!", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is as good as it gets!", "Author": "A. Goel \"4ML\"", "ReviewID": "R1WL4VHKLK7QP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "RESEARCH:After doing research for months, I ended up buying the 65ST30 from Amazon for $2050 last month. I'm a first time Plasma buyer, so researched QUITE a bit into this technology. I was surprised how far Plasmas have come along. I used to think they don't have a long life, or are an outdated technology. I couldn't have been more wrong. I also looked at the GT and the VT series, but VT was out of the question due to ridiculous pricing, and the picture quality of GT didn't look any different than ST30 at the local best-buy. GT does have a smaller bezel though, and is more attractive looking.Also, after reading several reviews and talking to people on AVS forum - I found out GT has bigger issues with floating blacks and brightness fluctuations, so decision was rather easy. ST30 was the one to get.CALIBRATION:After I got the set, I used the D-Nice's settings/slides to prep the set for his calibration (available online). You don't have to do this, even using his calibrated settings looked pretty good out of the box - but I went through his recommended process, to get the best possible image. If you have the patience, I'll recommend using his entire process. It's worth it.PICTURE QUALITY:After inputting the settings provided by D-Nice (and some of my tweaks) the picture quality was simply breathtaking. I was just amazed how natural the image looked. I was told this is the biggest advantage of going Plasma over LED, and at first I wasn't sure if I'll see much difference - but now I'm sold.I bought a 2011 LG LED TV just few months ago, and this Plasma is much better. I compared them next to each other, and it's not close. Not only you get true natural colors with Plasma, you get very deep blacks and no motion blur. Can't wait to watch some football on this beautiful set. I was somewhat worried about floating blacks - but no issues with this set. Watched a few Blu-Ray movies on it - and was blown away by the size of the TV and the fine picture quality. The TV speakers aren't great, but aren't bad either. I plan to buy a sound-bar at some point though.FEATURES:a) 3D - I'm not a big fan of 3D (not yet at least) but 3D is pretty damn good on this tv. Better than any other set I've come across. But, 3D image has always given me a head-ache, so I avoid using 3D.b) Online services - Basic applications are there, such as Netflix, Amazon videos, Youtube. User-Interface is very simple to use and is intuitive. I mostly use these services through the Blu-Ray player anyway. You can play videos or view pictures through SD slot or USB drive or DNLA server (connecting to your PC through wireless).c) Viera Connect - I love this feature. After I bought this TV, I also purchased a Panasonic Blu-Ray player and with Viera Connect, you can easily sync up the device with your TV and use the TV remote to control the player. Simple idea which makes a LOT of sense.d) Remote Control - I've not said this in a while, but I absolutely love the remote control that comes with this TV. It is also back-lit, which is helpful at night. Again, very simple and intuitive.CONS:I have yet to find anything wrong with this set. But, I must say - no TV is perfect. LEDs have their issues and Plasmas have their issues. I was aware of basic issues with Plasma's - so nothing caught me off-guard. I'll advise everyone to research these issues beforehand, or ask me if you have questions. These are small issues to deal with, nothing major but one must be aware of them.FINAL THOUGHTS:Another thing I'll advise everyone interested in buying a Plasma - don't go by what you see at your local store. If you have to compare at the store, compare Plasma TV with Plasma TV - not with LEDs. Plasma TVs need to be set-up according to your room and lighting. If not set correctly, Plasmas are likely to look pale and dull. To get the picture to pop-out and look accurate at the same time (something LEDs struggle with), you really need to mess with the settings. As mentioned before, google for D-Nice's settings - he is a professional calibrator who has shared his settings. Of course, you still have to tweak your settings - but it gives you a great starting point. Also head over to AVS forum where you can find more setting options and figure out what works best for you.I've had this TV for a month, and so far, it has been one of the best TVs I've ever purchased. Since then, I've purchased a 50ST30 as well for my bed-room and am just as pleased with that set. When you factor in the price (for 65ST30 or 50ST30), I doubt you can find a better deal out there. I looked at the Samsung Plasmas (which are skinnier) and look great as well. In the end, Panasonic is a more renowned brand when it comes to Plasmas and are still a step or two ahead when it comes to black levels and over-all quality. Also, Samsung has very poor customer service - which made the decision for me.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great television for the price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R257EGKRN5RX9C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Panasonic ST series sits at the perfect price point for those who are looking for a high quality television without breaking the bank.  The ST series loses the THX designation and some of the advanced adjustment features of the Panasonic GT and VT series, but it allows you to get a very good television under the 50in. minimum of the higher-end series.My experience with the television over the last few weeks has been positive.  Setting up the unit is straightforward and the guide appears to be written by someone who speaks English (Spanish and French are also available).  There are an ample number of connections for digital and analog services.  For grins, I plugged in my cable connection directly from the wall (bypassing the cable box) and the TV pulled down 80 analog channels and 40 digital channels with excellent clarity.  Initial setup takes you through everything that you will need your TV to due from labeling inputs, setting up a wireless internet connection to your home/office network, adjusting the clock, etc.A 802.11b/g/n wireless adapter comes included with the television and can either be plugged directly into one of two USB ports or attached using the included USB extension dongle.  Using the USB extender provides a clean look with no visible wires or attachments.  The adapter sticks out from the edge of the television about an inch if you opt to plug it in directly.  Since a final 802.11n standard has yet to be established, the adapter may have issues with your wireless network.  I use a Netgear router without any issues.  If you have troubles, I would recommend using a wireless bridge rather trying to find a suitable adapter, especially if you are using the TV with a Blu-ray player, game console, or any other devices that require an internet connection.The Viera Cast service turns the television to the internet with built in apps for most of the major streaming content providers (Netflix, Amazon Video, Alphaline, You Tube, etc.) in addition to a host of apps for games, sports, weather, news, and social networking.  Each time you access Viera Cast it will check for updates that must be completed prior to proceeding.  Usually this takes just a couple minutes if an update is required, but can be irritating when you want to do/view something.The image quality on this television is excellent out of the box with very black blacks and true colors.  The anti-glare screen works well in most situations.  I have noticed that at some, usually extreme, angles there is a good deal of reflection, but when viewed from a typical angle the result is very good.  2-D SD and HD are both excellent with no noticeable artifacts or ghosting.  I have not had a chance to test the 3-D viewability since the glasses (sold separately) are prohibitively expensive and there is not enough content out to justify the price at this time.  This should not dissuade a purchase, since it is now almost impossible to find a television with great 2-D viewability without 3-D capabilities.Overall, this is an excellent television and disputably the best under 50 inches.  The videophile will miss the advance color tuning options and THX capabilites, but those features simply don't exist in the current model year sub-50in televisions.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Design, but  \"green tint\" problem...", "Author": "ccou23", "ReviewID": "R12EI2UURV8CBZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I also have an issue with a \"green tint\" or \"blobs\" in various areas of the screen.  The green makes it difficult to judge the quality of the television because I keep focusing on the problem areas. Not sure if this is a problem with this series or if the TV was damaged during shipment.Amazon is sending a replacement, and I will update once the next set arrives.UPDATE 04/04/11:Received my replacement set.  Fired it up and immediately started running break-in slides to search for any green tint that appeared with the previous panel.  Once again, the green tint/blobs appeared on the grey scale slides, however, the green was much lighter with this panel and I can live with it. After two TV's and reading reviews online, this appears to be a common problem with this set.  The green blobs are rumored to fade as the panel ages.  I've run 100 hours of break-in slides and have seen no reduction.Design: 3/5The shiny, black bezel looks great.  Definitely an improvement over my previous Pansonic plasma.  The base swivels although it is \"stiff\" and awkard.  Compared to the design of the Samsung plasmas, I'd rate the design a 3 out of 5.Picture: 4/5Post break-in slides (100 hours) and calibration using the D-nice settings, the picture looks great.  The colors are excellent, and the blacks are much better than my previous plasma. There are a few minor problems.  First, the green tint appears when a grey images on is on the tv.  In fast moving scenes, the picture seems to fall apart or blur... and dark scenes can become grainy from time to time.  Overall, the picture is fantastic and the pros for outweight the cons.Viera Cast/3d: 5/5Love the ability to pull up Netflix, Skype, and Facebook on the TV screen along with the other various apps availabe in Viera Cast.

I have had their phones/shavers/Digital Cameras/and now a Blu-ray player and I love them ALL.2) I even absolutely love the PQ on this TV as well (barring fluctuating brightness of course).3) I'm giving it a 1-star rating with a heavy heart but with a firm observant mind.4) I wish I never had to write this review.The deal breaker??? - Fluctuating brightness!!!I have read rave reviews for this TV here/other places and I agree with them PQ-wise. But IF and only IF your set has this and you've noticed this you're done. I hope this is not the case with you but it IS the case with me and few others. Not sure how many \"few\" people it takes to get the attention of a major manufacturer but here is my viewing experience so far. I've had this TV for 3.5 weeks now.This TV tries to adjust its brightness A LOT. Majority of the time a scene changes between a dark scene to a (much) lighter scene/area - you can see the changing brightness  - especially on the face, it'll go wayyyy brighter, then back to normal. Eventually the light will be perfect/even great hue but the \"switching\" drives me nuts. While dark scenes themselves look great overall - I also noticed some dark/darkness adjustment even in a night scene where the light in the scene/room was off. It happens much less often but it does. The adjustment in dark scenes are not that distracting as they are less frequent/apparent. Daylight/bright scenes - another story.I even tried to \"ignore\" this by telling myself - oh well no TV is perfect and let me just \"live\" with it but I just couldn't. Besides - for a $2K TV to do what my $250 seven year old Sharp (CRT) TV does NOT do is simply unacceptable.I have tried Blue ray/SD content/HD contect/netflix/regular DVDs and they all display fluctuating brightness. I grant it's not there ALL the time but boy when it rears its ugly head (which is often) - that is ALL I watch and well that is ALL I'm watching right now - not willingly I must add. I've gotten the latest firmware as well.So why just a 1-star when the PQ/blacks are great. The brightness problem is so glaring that it handily undoes the MANY good/great/outstanding qualities of this TV. Speaking of outstanding - another great thing about the TV is skin tones - oh so natural. When I was TV hunting/doing \"eye test\" in stores - LED always seemed to have an edge. But man - this colors/skin tones are so realistic in this TV. I do not want to take away the great PQ of this TV - in all fairness, yet at the same time I do not want to take away the undeniably distracting viewing this TV presents to me. In fact I feel like I've been relegated to \"watching\" the fluctuating brightness instead of actually enjoying the experience of this otherwise great TV. I even tried telling myself - maybe I'm \"looking\" for this brightness fluctuation issue but no no no - it's THERE.I'm at a loss to explain why Panasonic did not/does not notice this - that is - if they don't. They need to fix it and fix it now. I BELIEVE Panasonic can and should make it right. And I still maintain it's a great TV. I do not know if others have had the same issue or to this degree but this has been my experience. I don't know the technical details but they *should* be able to fix this with a firmware fix. I have NOT given up on them and hence have requested Amazon for another ST30. It is a great TV otherwise but you buy a TV to enjoy the programming content, NOT distractions. Panasonic - you are the top plasma maker in the market. You guys even have the entire (former) Pioneer/Kuro team working for you. Will you please make it right!!!When I get the new TV - I will re-evaluate and post my findings. Oh by the way Amazon was 100% helpful/quick in sending a replacement. Thanks Amazon!!!****Update 3/29/12****I know I know  - LONG overdue update.Ok first of all - it IS a five star TV ... and then some.For this price - this picture - forget about it. I know D7000 is good as well but a tad more expensive.I had to go through 3 TVs before they figured out the A-board replacement. And boy does it fix the issue. I deliberately delayed my update a 'bit' 'cos I didn't want to just believe it 'cos others were saying it. I REALLY tried to 'find' the fluctuating brightness issue after the A-board replacement but I'm happy to say I just can't find it. This TV more than rocks. The prices are probably lower now... so what're you waiting for?  .. then again they have ST50 out now *wink wink*Someone asked earlier why so many ppl are giving 5 stars to this TV when others are (were) reporting fbr issues. Well - some of us had older versions where problem was prevalent. The new TVs post-august 2011 I think shouldn't have this issue and for the older ones the A-board replacement fixes the issue. Read my first review above - other than the fbr - the TV had NO fault at all. I can't comment on others' TVs but my issue went away right after the A-board fix.  I'm happy that Panasonic acknowledged and then fixed the issue with their product.I can't thank Amazon enough. They've been 100% supportive during the 2 times I had to replace the TV. Am glad it all worked out well in the end. I'm happy to say I don't regret buying this TV one bit .. even after all the trouble of replacing and waiting. I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat. Why?

The glare was horrible and the motion was soo jagged it drove me crazy.. The picture itself was great in normal scenes  but any action movie was very poor and watching movies with night scenes in the daytime was impossible due to the glare..I took the Samsung back and ordered this Panasonic 55ST30.. My wife and I had initially looked at Plasma's but we found that the LED picture just produced way more detail.. Though having to run the LED in 120hz mode to reduce blurry motion made scenes soo unrealistic due to the \"soap opera effect\" that we took a second look at Plasma. WOW!!!!! did we make the right moveConsumer reports ranks Plasma's  very highly.. No LED or LCD even cracks their top 10 in TV ratings.. This TV .. the 55ST30 ranks #1 out of every 3D TV with the highest marks.. even ahead of the higher priced Panasonic VT30 line..Pros..Pictures color.. WOW.. Just WOW.. I have watched shows that I watch every week that I watch now and am blown away from the color levels I never saw before. I love Deadliest Catch and watching it this week. The ocean has colors.. Hues of Blue from baby blue to Dark Blue.. The whitecaps are actually WHITE now.. The neon raingear worn by the crews pops out at levels I have never seen.. It is really intense.. Motion is way better than LED.. there are some jagged edges in super fast motion but not much.. BlueRay is out of this world.. Seriously we watched Biebers documentary on this TV and I was shocked by the details and colors.Cons... TV does look a bit blurry on SOME source stations. It looks great on Blueray and most HD but I noticed content that is not shot very well in HD or HD channels that play content that is converted to HD signal looks somewhat average. I did not have this on LED due to the image sharpening of 120hz.. even though 120hz is fake sharpening .. It still looked clearer.. But like I said.. HD content originally filmed in HD looks amazing.. I will switch back to DirecTV as I find their HD  stations have the best picture. The Samsung definitely wins design.. It just looks really cool and stylish.. The Panasonic looks just OK.. looks kinda old school.. Bezel is bigger.. But in the end I care how the picture looks way more than the TV itself.. The glare is typical for a Plasma.. not as bad as the Samsung LED I had but glare would be a huge issue if there are windows facing this TVI have heard reports of buzzing on Panny TV's but I have not had an issue with it.. I did have an issue with the ambient light sensor that auto dims the screen based on room light.. I THINK though I am not sure.. that my soundbar in front of the TV is reflecting TV light back at the sensor causing the screen to dim and brighten quite a bit .. I have disabled that feature though and am fine with not having it enabled.I can't really comment on sound as I bypass TV completely for a surround sound systemIn the end....LED and Plasma both have tradeoffs.. LED is brighter and crisper image.. Plasma is better for motion scenes and has much better blacks and true color detail that does not look as washed out.  For the cost of the Samsung I was not willing to compromise on small detail. if the Samsung was $1500 I could see keeping it but at $2200 I would not.. The Panasonic was $1450 and came with two pair of Rechargable glasses and Avatar 3D ( a $400 value)  I am happy with the price and amazed at how I feel like I am seeing colors for the first time. I have never had a Plasma before due to the fear of image retention but I am very happy with my choice so far.

Best Image I've Seen.", "Author": "Kelub", "ReviewID": "R1GYODHIOQY57L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV to replace a 46\" Vizio LCD that, after only 3 years, started having backlight issues. Prior to the purchase I agonized over my choices. I work with technology and felt very comfortable with LCD/LED screens; I also knew that my peers were choosing the latest & greatest LCD/LED technology for their new TVs. I had never thought much of plasma because of its initial reputation: expensive, fragile, burn-in, etc. I had not really kept up with the advances in the technology. Being on a budget, I wanted to get the most for my money, so decided to look back into plasma technology. I mean, if it's so unpopular, why is it still around?After doing some research, I began to understand why there was still a market for plasma: it is preferred by those who really care about their TV technology. The fact that prices for the systems were now lower than comparable LCD televisions was only an added bonus. Once the decision to go plasma was made, I had to then choose a set. Since I wanted to take advantage of Amazon's 24 month no interest financing offer, I had to choose between the LG and the Panasonic. That choice was a little easier: after reading literally every single review for both TVs on Amazon, as well as countless 3rd party professional reviews, I went with the Panasonic. The history and reputation of quality, as well as customer satisfaction, had me sold.I have had the set for about 4 weeks now, and will share with you my experience so far.SHIPPING: I used the super-saver shipping, which used the Home Direct USA company to ship from Amazon to a local company, then local company to my house. Despite finding some negative reviews with Home Direct, I can tell you that I made two phone calls to them to confirm location and timing (their tracking site doesn't update regularly, it only tells you when they picked it up from amazon and when it's delivered to the local company) and that both times they were extremely courteous and helpful. The TV arrived at the local carrier exactly when it was supposed to. The local carrier first set a day for delivery which was 1 day later than the Amazon \"delivered by\" date, but that wasn't really a big deal. They did, however try to call the day before delivery to have the date pushed back further because of driver issues; I insisted on keeping my original date (as I had already requested the time-off from work) and they were able to accommodate. The delivery men were professional and courteous, and my only minor gripe about them is that one of them tried to get me to sign the \"I received the package free of damage\" form prior to actually opening the TV to test for damage. I politely refused to sign it until we did so, and it was a non-issue. There was no damage to the set from transport.BREAK-IN PERIOD: I had planned on running the break-in slides and doing the whole dnice process (see highdefjunkies for more info), but the room I was placing this TV in had exactly 27 hours before my daughter's sleepover birthday party would be held in that room, and I knew that 7 pre-teen girls would not take kindly to 1) no TV or 2) watching color slides as entertainment. Therefore, I set aside my plans for the 100-150 hour break-in and began researching its necessity. I discovered there are just as many people who feel this is totally unnecessary as there are who feel it's completely necessary; however the argument against it is that, basically, if the manufacturer was at all concerned about quality reputation, and felt this was needed, they would include it in the manual. Since it is not included, then it's likely not necessary. If you want to do it, and have the luxury of doing so, go for it. Honestly had I not needed the set within a short timeframe, I would have probably done it myself just to say I did it. UNDERSTAND that the break-in is NOT tied to image retention (more on that later); it is simply meant to evenly age the phosphors so that when calibration is performed later on, the calibrator can be assured they are working off the same baseline. I did keep the brightness and contrast down and I zoomed in when watching anything with bars for the first few hours of use (maybe 20). I've since turned the brightness and contrast up and have watched LOTR: Fellowship along with a few other movies.CALIBRATION SETTINGS: In order to set the TV to settings I liked, I started with dnice's post-break-in calibration settings. Purists will surely say that this is blasphemy and that I should be stripped of my television set immediately and forced to an amish internment camp. No, no, slow down. I do not, will not, claim that those calibration settings, minus the break-in period, will give me absolutely the best image possible since I didn't follow his procedure. He's a professional calibrator, and I understand why he disclaims to do the other settings first, because he doesn't want someone using his settings w/o doing it then claiming he's wrong.  I simply wanted to use his as a starting point. Once I get it set, and watched for a little bit, I began tweaking here and there. Sometimes I prefer warm1 over warm2. I've turned the contrast and brightness up just a little bit. Etc Etc. It just depends. Keep in mind something that is stated by many on those forums: what most of us are used to watching is over-saturated, over-brightened images that are not true to real-life. The calibration settings get as close to real-life as possible; if you want your image over-saturated, more vibrant, etc., then you'll have to tweak it yourself. YMMV.PICTURE QUALITY: Wow. I mean... wow. Again, coming from LCD, I didn't know clarity existed on this level. To me, going from a mid-range LCD TV to a high quality plasma was like re-discovering HDTV. I'm not sure I can really quantify the experience, to be quite honest. I'm not sure I can write too much on PQ because it's simply difficult to describe. The image is crisp and sharp on a level previously unseen by me, and it looks... natural. Once I've seen it, I feel like LCD images are having to overcompensate to get close to this level of clarity. It'd be as if all you've ever had is artificial sweetener, then tasted real sugar for the first time in your life. It's just... authentic.- Glare: Some people are concerned about glare from plasma. This TV glares no more than new LCDs do. Don't let that stop you.- Viewing Angle: My viewing room is pretty square, so the viewers are never more than probably 25-30 degrees left or right of the middle of the TV; however, just to test, I've stood 75-80 degrees to the side, and the image quality does not drop off in the slightest. Additionally, there is no difference vertically - a big problem I had with past LCDs. Whether the TV is slightly above, below, or directly in front of your viewing angle will make no difference to your perceived picture quality.SOUND QUALITY: I have the TV hooked up to a receiver w/ 6.1 surround sound, but I did briefly test the speakers on the TV prior to connecting it to the sound system. If I were using the TV for casual television viewing, the built-in speakers would be plenty adequate. I can't go in more detail because I only listened long enough to take a \"thumbs up/down\" measurement, and decided thumbs up based on about 30-60 seconds of listening.IMAGE RETENTION: Ok, meat and potatoes time. Does the TV suffer from image retention? Again, I've only had it about 3-4 weeks, and probably only about 40-50 hours of use so far. I can tell you that the first day I had it, I used the heck out of it, primarily with my PS3 (for watching blu-rays, .mp4/.avi movies, and playing some games). There were a few times when I walked away from the TV with the PS3's primary menu up (the XMB), and I had a picture of my kids on the background. That night, when I turned off the TV and the room was totally dark, I could *faintly* see a residual image of my kids' outlines on the TV. I went downstairs for about 30 minutes, came back up, and it was gone. It was never noticeable when watching or playing anything. Since then, I've played Madden 12, Uncharted 3, aforementioned LOTR:FOTR, and other movies/tv shows, and have not once experienced any IR at all. I also changed the XMB background on the PS3 from my kids to the default one, which a more pastel color with moving glittery specks. Bottom line: I believe because the TV was new, and the phosphors soft, the image retention was most likely to occur, and even then it was a non-issue. As the phosphors have aged, even after 40-50 hours, it's no longer an issue.- Gaming: many people are concerned about gaming on plasmas in regards to IR. Don't be. From what I can tell, all the recent games I've played have breaks in the action when any static images are removed and the entire screen is used for something. Example: Madden 12 may have a score box up, but it frequently cuts to instant replays, quarter/half endings, and other cutscenes that remove the static image every couple of minutes. The same with Uncharted 3. There is never more than a few minutes at a time when a static image is left on the screen. And the older your TV gets, the more aged the phosphors get, the less likely IR is to occur or be a concern.BRIGHTNESS FLUCTUATION: I haven't checked the back to see when my TV was manufactured, but I can say with certainty that I'm not experiencing the problems that others are describing. This leads me to believe that the models being shipped out (at least from Amazon directly) are newer and have the patch applied.ADDITIONAL FEATURES:- 3D: Sorry, I'm no help here. I bought a 3D TV so I'd have that option to invest in later. I have no glasses or 3D movies to watch.- VierraCast: I no longer subscribe to NetFlix, so I can't tell you about its player (other than the fact that it's there.) Pandora lets you manage multiple accounts from one screen, so that's pretty awesome. There is an Amazon Video player, the first I've seen one in a device such as this (why isn't it available on the PS3 yet?!?) but I don't use them either. Overall, the online options are plenty in quantity, the menu is easy to navigate and responsive to the remote (compared to some I've used, like Samsung), and getting to the menu takes 1 button, which is nice.- VierraLink: This lets you link devices like your PS3 and the TV via HDMI. I haven't tried using the TV remote for stopping/starting video or for navigating the screen, but I do LOVE the fact that turning on one device turns on the other, so long as the TV was last used on that input. If I turn on the TV, the PS3 automatically comes on. The PS3 tells you when enabling this feature that if it's actively in use (i.e. playing a game or watching a movie) it disables the shut-off feature, so if you want to leave your game paused to grab some food but want to shut down the TV, you can.- DLNA/Media player: the DLNA player works, but Panasonic obviously didn't want to pay for a DIVX license or something because it won't play .AVI files. As an Apple user, I typically handbrake everything to .mp4 (H.264 codec) anyway, and those play fine. I use the PS3 for most of my media playback needs, but there are times that it's not the best option, and the TV's DLNA server is used. The media player is separate, and is used when you want to plug in a USB or SD device. My biggest complaint about both is that the browsing of files has a \"feature\" where it will start playing the video in a preview window as you're trying to browse. In a large list of files, this can be a problem. The interface bogs down and becomes difficult to get through, almost as though the memory buffer gets full from trying to play the previews. On a USB stick this isn't a problem; on a DLNA server with 85 files in 1 folder, it's a problem.Aesthetics: The bezel is nice, the base is nice. The TV is sturdy on the base - I had to pull the cabinet out last night to get behind it for some cabling (unrelated to the TV) and the LCD used to teeter a little bit when I did it - never in danger of falling, but never giving me a fully secure feeling, either - but the Panasonic didn't budge. I might mount it on the wall one day, but for now it works sitting on the cabinet.Summary:Pros:- Image quality is the best I've ever seen, blows away every LCD I've seen. Calibrate for best results (don't just take default settings)- Glare is reduced and on-par with new LCDs- Heat is no worse, and in fact better, than the LCD I replaced it with from 2008- Viewing angle - view it from anywhere you can see the screen without quality drop-off- Tedious break-in period is recommended by some but not considered necessary by plenty others. I didn't and am happy.- Image retention is mostly a non-issue; early in its life-cycle there might be a minor case of it, but it's not visible during viewing and will stop as phosphors age.- Sound is slightly above average, although an external sound system is always recommended.- Added features such as VierraLink, VierraCast, DLNA and media player are nice and work as expected. They're easy to get to and navigate.- Aesthetically pleasing; the bezel is not too large or distracting, and the base is solid and sturdy.Cons:- Coming from LCD, it's hard to get use to \"true black.\" If watching a compressed video, blacks may not translate correctly, resulting in black blobbed mass on the screen. I've had to turn up the brightness on a couple of videos to be able to see. This was *only on compressed videos* though, and probably not very well done. DVDs, Blu-Rays, TV, and higher quality digital files were fine.- Ports. Some will say \"yeah but this is the lower end of their line-up.\" I don't care. It's competing against other TVs at the same price point, and it fails on this aspect. 3 HDMI vs 4 on others, and no VGA port. This alone made the choice between the LG and Panasonic difficult. Fortunately I cared about quality of image and brand reputation more than 2 extra ports, but I shouldn't have to make that choice. I don't foresee it being an issue with me as I don't have a lot of things to plug into this TV, but for others it could be a frustration.BOTTOM LINE:I recommend this set and this brand to everyone who will listen, and to many who don't care. I liked it so much that I decided this week to take advantage of the 24 months no interest deal a bit more and upgrade our crappy little LCD in the bedroom to the 42\" Panasonic S30 TV (the price difference made me go with the S instead of the ST.) I look forward to getting it in sometime next week. If you're trying to decide between LCD and plasma, and you want the best picture quality at the best price, get the plasma--and get the Panasonic.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible Changing Brightness Problem", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R3JYD7NVBEKDMY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just got this home and ran it through calibration process.

And after the Spanish speaking delivery guys mounted it on the stand, plugged it in and left me to hook it up myself at my request, I began setting up the TV.This set comes with every possible connection that you will need to view and listen to anything that you want, it includes a WiFi adapter for your Internet applications which plugs into one of the two USB ports available and obviously, an SD card slot for viewing pictures, listening to mp3's,3D movies etc.There is also a pc connection if you decide to go that route,but i use one of the HDMI connections for my laptop which does an exceptional job.There are four HDMI input jacks, an optical digital audio output jack, and all the other standard inputs that you would need including a PC and a wired LAN connection.Setting up this beast took approximately 15 minutes, after which I began looking at the digital as well as analog channels that came in on my cable system.After setting the picture function to vivid, and backing off some of the adjustments, the thing looked superb...  I also own a Panasonic vierra 50in plasma set that works like a champ, which is the reason that I went for this one, and the picture here exceeds the images I would see with the 50 inch.I fooled around a little bit with the Internet applications, it has all the usual ones, netflix - twitter -face book etc.It also has some games that you can play and if you want to,and you can download more apps...  Some are free and some cost around 3 to 4 dollars to install in the TV.  Looks nice and works as well as you might expect...  My DSL connection is only  700 mbit so the quality isn't as topnotch as it would be on a faster connection...  Say FIOS or something.I then throw in the avatar 2D bluray DVD, and that's where this thing really shines!  The set has a function in it that allows you to smooth the image.  This is very useful for removing the jerkyness that you see on most televisions when things move from side to side or up and down and it gives the appearance of a very smooth and flowing image...  I love this and you have the option of turning this on and off.  You can see this effect on some sharp and Samsung LCD TVs...  Now it's available on plasma..  Very nice.  The thing is maybe about an inch thick front to back so when you view it from the side you can barely even see it...  And then as you step outwards from the side of it, you start to see all of the picture with no color degradation or reduction in brightness that you get with LCD TVs, so viewing angles aren't a problem.This is one of the clear reasons for me buying a plasma TV.  And the black levels, as promised, are infinitely black!  I viewed it in a completely darkened room and contrast levels are amazing... when the screen goes black, you couldn't see anything in the room except for the red light on the television.The set is 3D ready but you'll need to buy 3D bluray player and the special Panasonic active shutter 3D glasses that you have to purchase separately... Another $400 or so for those additions...  So for now I can't comment on the 3D functionality of this set..  But I am sure that it is beautiful because everything else looks great on this titanic screen.My son has seen it and is bugging me about getting the 3D glasses so that he can see how avatar looks in 3D so maybe there will be an addition to this long review coming soon.  Kudos to Panasonic..  I love it!5/29/11-I forgot to mention the one BIG negative that i have with this set,that is the speaker system within the tv,they SUCK!They sound like something you would find in say a 19\"television,thin and tiny...its kinda weird that my 50\"speakers seem to sound better than these but i guess that the thinking is with a screen this big,you will be using an external surround system anyway, as i do,so there's that.It also comes with a very well-lit,when the light button is pressed,remote control.There are many more things this set can do,you'll have to get one and play with it to check them out,LB", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Plasma, but has serious NetFlix audio processing issues.", "Author": "Golf.Messiah", "ReviewID": "RPCYEXY234FGC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The 55\" ST-30 has a very impressive picture. It plays all content as promised with the exception of Netflix audio. The Netflix video playback is perfect, no delays, no buffering issues, very clean smooth presentation. Unfortunately, the audio playback crackles with many quick sharp cracks and stutters that are quite annoying. It almost appears that the audio processor cannot keep up most of the time. Using the optical audio output to a surround sound system only served to amplify the problem. The TV speakers crackle constantly while playing Netflix but the TV speakers are weak and muffled so the crackling is not as frightening to small children. There are forums where this ST-30 Netflix audio problem has been noted by other new ST-30 owners. Panasonic support seemed to be aware there is a problem. They indicated a senior support engineers would get back to us in about a week. We have the latest software version and used both a wired and wireless connection.It's a great TV if you don't use Netflix or if you use a Blu-Ray player or some other device to stream Netflix to the TV. Just don't expect this TV to process Netflix on its own. Hard to believe they are shipping a new product this way but hopefully it can be resolved with an application update. YouTube and all other streaming playback sources were fine.Also be aware that the supply of Panasonic 3D glasses may have been impacted by Japan's issues. Our order has been delayed and many vendors are \"Temporarily out of stock\". Because I do not have glasses I cannot comment on the ST-30's 3D capabilities.I will update the review when the Netflix audio issue has been resolved one way or another.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV with excellent picture (Fixed Fluctuating Brightness)", "Author": "Christopher R.", "ReviewID": "R2HWYRZTN8LM63", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "******* See my latest Update/Edit at this bottom of this original review *******I have owned this TC-P50ST30 for a just over 2 months now.  Bought from Amazon, it arrived quickly and in perfect condition and the delivery driver helped me bring it inside and helped me open it to make sure it was ok before signing for it.  The TV is used for typical family content (movies, TV, & sports) from DirecTV HD-DVR and blu-ray playter, and has ~500hours on it.While the finish of the bezel is not anywhere near as elegant as my TC-P65VT30 it is more than adequate, if a bit understated.  The TV is thin and looks great mounted on the wall. Again, at this price point, for a plasma with great picture quality that supports 3D... this set is a bargain, and the looks are just fine.  I would have preferred a metal bezel, but there is nothing that sticks out as bad with the looks of this thing.I had no problem adjusting this TV to get a great resulting picture.  I couldn't believe how great the picture quality was on this TV from day one, especially considering it came at such a great price point.  With tuned in settings the colors are deep and rich but not over saturated, the blacks and shadow detail were tremendous, and the 3D looked amazing. My family and I enjoyed this TV with none of the problems that others have complained about (green \"blobs\", buzzing, IR/Burn-in, fluctuating brightness) for the first 450 or so hours. Then, as if someone flipped a switch... smack, here comes the fluctuating brightness.  I started to notice it on several older movies, and thought that it was just because the content was older.  As the days went it on it got worse and starting presenting itself on more and more content, including movies that we had watched before with no problems.  At this point it is now hard to watch a movie or TV show that has any kind of quick scene change from a dark scene to a brighter scene because of these fluctuations.  If they happened gradually it would be fine and would not be noticed, or if they happened immediately at the scene change it would be fine as well.  As it is, when the scene changes as described above, there is a brightness shift approximately half a second afterwards.I've watched the same content on an LCD that I have in my bedroom, from the same source and do not see these fluctuations.  I have also watched this same content, from the same source, on my TC-P65VT30 and do not see these fluctuations.  There is clearly something wrong this set, however from reading others experiences.. Panasonic is claiming that this is normal and within spec, and is a design \"feature\".  Really?  I have a call in to Panasonic now, and am waiting to hear back.  It is a shame because this TV was such a great deal and looked so great at the start, in fact it still looks great.. but it is hard to watch and enjoy it with these problems.Unfortunately if Panasonic cannot get this taken care of with a software update, this TV will be relegated to a gaming set for the kids to use with the Xbox. I'm not pleased.EDIT/UPDATE: Since posting my original review, Panasonic has come forward and really stepped up to the plate.  Engineer's took on all reports regarding the fluctuating brightness problems, worked with calibration experts in the field, and have developed a fix.  There are two options available for fixing the fluctuating brightness: #1. A Panasonic representative can come to your house and install a software fix (this is a flash to the core software on the TV) using an SD card.  #2. Panasonic can send an authorized service center to replace the A-board of the TV with a new one that already contains the updated/fixed software.  It is at Panasonic's discretion (mostly dependent to availability of Panasonic field reps).  In my case I got the software fix, but I know many others who have had the A board replacement and have seen the same results as I have.When the Panasonic rep came to my house, we watched content to show the problem, the rep then followed his procedure and flashed the firmware on both TV's.  After the software upgrades we watched the exact same content we watched just 10 minutes earlier, and the fluctuations were gone.  It has now been 4 days since the update and I have yet to see any remaining fluctuations/problems.Panasonic has stated that they are incorporating this fix into all newly produced 2011 sets starting with August builds, and will fix any TV's that have already been purchased of produced prior to that.  If you have already have a set with this problem, contact Panasonic Viera Concierge immediately and they will get you taken care of.Panasonic should be very much applauded for taking care of this problem, I am extremely pleased with not on the the TV's, but with this resolution.  This update to my original review is a reflection of such.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "65ST30 Great (After Fluctuating Brightness Patch)", "Author": "tfoltz", "ReviewID": "R10L3QVJM4XQP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fluctuating Brightness:Most will agree that the picture on this set is fantastic except for the fluctuating brightness problem. Panasonic North America has created a patch for this issue. If you own a set that has this problem, contact Panasonic and let them know that you see \"fluctuating brightness\" on various content. They make sure you have the latest firmware updates, and that CATS is off, and then will document your settings. Once you let them know that you still see fluctuating brightness they will schedule a technician visit to replace your A-Board or flash your TV with an SD Card (new A-Board is the most likely). The new A-Board/SD Card flash will fix the fluctuating brightness. I received it this weekend and all scenes that exhibited the problem before are now working as they should. Bravo to Panasonic NA for addressing the issue.Image Quality:The picture quality on this panel is amazing. Black levels are deep, colors are lifelike/realistic and still vibrant at the same time, whites are white, movement is fluid for sports and video games (no input lag at all for video games). Keep in mind, the TV can only produce an amazing picture as long as you provide it great content (blu-ray, and HD cable/satellite to a lesser degree), so don't feed it junk (SD content).3D:The 3D quality is exceptional. The depth you will experience makes for some exciting experiences. I initially wrote 3D off as a gimmick, but you realize the fun you can have once you pick up some high quality 3D content. While watching 3D movies occasional crosstalk/ghosting is noticeable in some scenes when a bright image is in front of dark backgrounds; this is usually sporadic and many other sets will show the same ghosting...just the nature of the 3D beast right now. Overall the 3D is fantastic. Out of the 3D movies I own, here is the order I rank them: Avatar, Tangled, Rio, Tron Legacy, Ice Age 3. Many more 3D movies are coming out so it's a great time to give 3D a try. I have only played a few 3D games such as Wipeout, Stardust, Black Ops, and Uncharted 3 Beta. So far Wipeout wins, Uncharted 3 and Stardust were pretty good, but Black Ops was lame in my opinion. As time goes on I would imagine the quality of 3D gaming increases.Settings:First of all, hire a professional calibrator (not Best Buy) to get the most accurate settings. However, since many individuals don't want to spend extra money for a calibration, search for D-Nice's settings in Google for some great/accurate Custom settings that don't involve extensive work (I won't publish his settings here). I've also found that Cinema provides a very nice picture, and here are the settings I use (note that each set will vary):Picture Settings:Picture Mode: CinemaContrast: 92Brightness: 55Color: 56Tint: -1Sharpness: 0Color Temp: Warm 2C.A.T.S.: OffVideo NR: OffAspect Adjustments Settings:Screen Format: FullHD Size: Size 2 (occasionally Size 1 depending on what I'm watching)HDMI Settings:Leave on defaultAdvanced Picture:Block NR: OffMosquito NR: OffMotion Smoother: OffBlack Level: Light3:2 Pulldown: On24p Direct in: 60HzFor 3D, I use the same settings above, but increase Contrast to 100, and sharpness to 50.I gathered these settings with the Disney WOW blu-ray optimizer. If you haven't heard of that disc, I highly recommend you research it and think about purchasing it because it comes with some great tips/explanations, a pixel flipper (I'll talk about that in a second), and a visual reference disc that has videos of some great scenery.Issues:As with all plasmas, you will notice some line-bleed in various content. The line-bleed will seem enhanced because of the large size of the TV, but there is nothing you can do about it. Ultimately, it will not negatively affect your TV viewing. One issue many people freak out about is image retention and/or burn in. As you will find in many knowledgeable discussions of plasma TVs, burn in is extremely unlikely in this day and age. Sure, it is possible to ruin your TV if you never vary your content, but it takes some effort. To be extra cautious, make sure to take it easy in the first 100 hours. I personally don't lower my contrast and brightness settings, but many people do. I just make sure to switch content up once in a while, try to watch fullscreen content without logos, and limit time playing video games. Once the TV has aged a bit, you can use it as normal. Be careful not to ONLY watch stations 24/7 with a fixed logo, or scoreboard (ESPN), and don't ONLY play the same video game for numerous days in a row without switching up the content. This doesn't mean you can't play video games for a long time, or watch ESPN for a while, it just means be cautious and smart. Sure, after some long game sessions you may see the HUD, or the scoreboard after watching some sports, but it will go away after some time. One thing I mentioned earlier was a pixel flipper on the Disney WOW disc. It provides a constantly moving static signal that exercises each pixel on your screen to specifically combat image retention; it's a pretty cool feature that I highly recommend. Overall, as time goes on and your TV gets older it will more or less build up an immunity to image retention. So far, I watch movies and play video games heavily on the 65ST30 and have not noticed any image retention at all.If you want to research more about this TV, or any TVs, check out [...].

Use Electrical tape!", "Author": "Garison Draper", "ReviewID": "R3VQW799EMKVF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Before I purchased my TV from Amazon I first went to my local Best Buy to see the problem for myself. I figured that since everyone talked about how bad the brightness problem was, I should be able to easily notice it in the store. To my surprise, the image looked great! So, I ordered my TV from Amazon (almost half the cost of Best Buy) and received it a week later only to find out that the TV kept changing the brightness for me, as described here and elsewhere.  So, I too ran into the brightness fluctuation problem as described here on Amazon by pretty much everyone!As soon as I the problem started appearing I figured out the pattern of it only being noticeable at night. My first weekend of enjoying my new 3D TV went great, as long as I watched it during the day.  This lead me to believe that there was a photo sensor somewhere on the TV that was the actual source of the problem itself.  After spending a few minutes covering various parts of the black bezel around the screen, I found the sensor:  A small white-ish sensor on the lower front of the TV located in the 3D sensor bar to the left of the red power light.Once I covered this sensor, the TV got dark and stayed that way! Now I have something to work with when changing the settings for brightness and contrast, ect.  So off to the garage I went, to get some electrical tape!I cut a small strip of electrical tape and placed it over the sensor.  This stopped the TV from shifting between what I described as day and night mode.Let me make myself clear on this review:  This TV IS STUNNING once the brightness problem is resolved.  I should NOT have to solve this problem in this way. Shame on Panasonic.  With that said, it is a simple fix to make this TV one of the best out there.  Hopefully Panasonic will have an official fix for this soon. I will give it four out of five stars once this problem is officially fixed.

My nearly six year old 720p DLP projection set began to feel a bit small.I first tried a near top of the line Samsung LED LCD in this same size, but its picture was not uniform with backlight bleed extremely evident around the edges.  A problem with the latest LCD televisions.Therefore, I knew a beautiful Panasonic Plasma would be the answer!  In most ways, this is a strikingly great set.  It's a wonderful value here on Amazon too.  The features are nothing to laugh about.  Everything you would expect.  1080p, 3D (no glasses included though), and Viera Cast Internet Connection applications (these work great and include Amazon on Demand, Netflix, Pandora, Ustream, Weather Apps, and more).  A lot to like.  Indeed, a lot to love.The HDMI inputs are slightly limited at three, but most people will have a A/V receiver with HDMI inputs or a HDMI switch from Monoprice, so no issue there.  VGA input for PC is also missing, but I simply used a Mini Display port to HDMI adapter on my Mac Mini, so I have my Home Theater Mac connected just as easy as if the TV had a VGA port.  No issue there either.  You can map the regular A/V audio ports (white and red) to supply audio with the PC HDMI connection.The picture I immediately found to be great.  The blacks were oh so beautiful compared to the LCD.  The picture just felt more like it should too.  Great colors, great blacks, and no problem with fast action on the screen.  You must have slightly lower panel brightness to maintain accurate color, but for most, this is not a deal breaker.3D works fine too.  Panasonic uses IR signals (instead of Bluetooth as Samsung uses) to get the 3D information to the glasses, but it still works great!  Plasma seems slightly dim for 3D, but the other natural advantages of Plasma work fantastic with 3D, so it's a fine choice!  The 3D DirecTV channels work great with this set too!There is but one problem.  It seems nearly all Panasonic Plasma ST, GT, & VT (yes even the top of the line VT series) Plasma televisions manufactured between February 2011 through July 2011 have a problem called \"fluctuating brightness.\"  When a scene changes, you can see the set automatically, abruptly, change the brightness of the panel.  This is rather disturbing and ruins the feel of the scene/film.  Some content makes it show up much more regularly while some content causes it to hardly be seen at all.  However, for a brand new television, one hopes not to have such an issue.Panasonic has issued a fix and the word on the street is that sets build in August and later of 2011 have been corrected.  Furthermore, a technician can come to your home and update the earlier sets, but in some cases this requires the replacement of the A board in the television, which means they have to open up the TV.  I do not really want my 1.5 week old TV opened up.  After all, it was a new set.  Therefore, I may be returning mine.  Sadly, I did not purchase on Amazon, so I will have to drive it back to the store.Overall, the ST30 is a wonderful television and I very much like my 55-inch version.  Sadly, the fluctuating brightness feels like a devastating flaw.  While I still recommend the TV, you might wait several weeks for the August and later builds to be more common.  After all, my September purchase was a March built set.  This TV offers a lot at a great value.  It's only sad we must worry about fixing this fluctuating brightness issue.  Without the flaw, the TV would have scored near 4.5 stars.  I would not run to a Samsung Plasma though either.

What is not as well known is just how good Panasonics are in light of the competition.  I make no bones that I am a plasma fan over LCDs.  I still believe that regardless of the progress LCDs have made in recent years, a plasma is what an LCD wants to be when it grows up, and for two key reasons: depth of blacks and angle of view.  These are inherent advantages of the plasma technology, and weaknesses of LCDs. To be fair, the major disadvantages of plasmas have been power consumption and brightness, and are largely overcome in the current crop of Panasonic plasmas.The ST-class from Panasonic is one step down from the their premier GT line and up from the non-3D S-Class, and if you want less than a 50\" screen, the top of the line.  In addition to all the expected bells and whistles, you'll also find a WiFi adapter in the box. That's attention to detail, and saves you about $50 if you need it. One other feature worth mentioning: Panasonic has integrated their digital product family better than anyone else.  The remote not only controls the very-well regarded Panasonic DVD players, but also allows you to control playback from Panasonics equally well-regarded digital cameras!So all this would be for naught if the one thing you buy a big-screen for was lacking - the picture.  It is bright enough in almost all lighting conditions, with the deep blacks and contrast you expect from a good plasma, excellent crisp 3D performance with minmal artifacts, and out of the box, among the better calibrated sets on the market.  While virtually all big-screens benefit from calibration, most people will find that is an option with the Panasonics.  This is definitely not the case with most other TVs I looked at. Many were so far off spec as to be laughable.  Figure that as a $150 to $200 savings.

All of them looked pretty good. I kept running into troubling reviews on the Samsungs with multiple problems as well as lawsuits and the picture didn't look quite as good as the pannys. It is getting pretty difficult to find a 70\" sharp like the 732/734 models for a good deal as now they have been replaced with their edge lit models. The LG was very cool in the fact that you could use cheap 3d glasses and it looked great except it had major bleed in dark scenes due to it being edge lit. Then I came across this Panasonic. I have read many bad reviews and issues with it but after digging deep enough, the reviews were either at older models or issues that have been addressed and fixed. Here is the beef without pulling any punches, on my new 65\" Panasonic plasma...Only had it for 2 days so if anything changes, I will update this.First I will start with the good. Right away without changing a thing, I noticed that the blacks were amazing. Not just good, but incredible. The details seen on dark scenes are really cool to finally see. After calibrating it, the colors are very film like and the PQ itself is probably the best I have seen aside from a Kuro. Some have complaints with the brightness which I was very worried about. At the store, this thing looked REALLY dim especially compared to the led lit sets. I do have blinds on my windows but even in the daytime, this was plenty bright for me. I actually turned the brightness down quite a bit from the suggested settings I found on the avs forums. I can't see how this would not be bright enough for anyone unless they are outside or in direct light. It handles motion fine, I tried to find some artifacts or blurring but couldn't. In fact, I had to really struggle to find anything wrong with it. All the fast motion looked fluid and stunning. Before complaining about the soe (soap opera effect) turn it off in the settings. I have read to many reviews with tards knocking the set without turning it off. I suppose there are a small amount of people that enjoy this nausea style of motion but most hate it. Some say the bezel is outdated but coming from an older lcd rear projection, it looks fine to me although a tad glossy. Can't say that the bezel would ever be a deal breaker since I would be watching the screen itself 99% of the time. The controller is nicely laid out and very easy to use. The menus are easy to navigate and work fine. I can't really comment on the stand since it is wall mounted but it looks sturdy and also can't say much about the sound since it would be kind of silly to spend this much on a display without a receiver. I haven't seen any issues of fluctuating brightness and the level seems to be uniform and easy on the eyes. The PQ is definitely this tvs strong point. I used the usb port for the break in slides and it recognized it quick and the slideshows were stupid easy to do. Pictures look cool and worked fine. I haven't got the wireless set up on it yet as I am having some issues but that's because of my router and the nightmare networking set up I have here. (5 computers, networked receiver and blu-ray player) Ok, now for the bad (or not so good). When displaying dark scenes, it does give off a buzz. It is not annoying and to hear it, everything must be silent and I hear all the clocks in my home ticking too so it's not to bad. I have incredible hearing and sitting at approx 11 feet away, I can barley hear it. Some have said that it gets better, some say it gets worse and some say it depends on your altitude so who knows. (I'm at around 3500 feet fyi)Thinking about it, my old tv had a fan that turned on that was much louder and I never even thought of it till now. Not even enough to knock off a star. The location of the usb ports on the side are kinda dumb. The wi-fi dongle sticks out from the side a little. Not a huge deal and it is deep enough to conceal a standard flash drive so it's not to bad. The one thing I did find with the picture quality is what is called \"line bleed\". The only way I am able to reproduce it is when there is one of those green screens with a coming attraction that has the ratings on it written in white. There is kind of a horizontal turd of discoloration where the lettering is. From what I have read, it is not a manufacturing problem and is considered \"normal\" for plasmas. I made it quite a bit better with the settings and the only time I have seen it is on these \"coming attraction\" or \"ratings\" screens. I have read other people talk about them during movies but could not see it. I haven't tested the 3-d yet but these 2011 sets use the older IR active style glasses which I am not crazy about. The newer blue-tooth style ones are supposed to be better range wise, comfort and price wise but that's just what I have heard. The biggest drawback is said to be that you need to be in the line of sight with the tv. Seems silly that you could ever position yourself NOT in the line of sight but maybe some people like watching tv upside down, around the corner and under the bed. I do wish it was passive 3d like the LG sets. I don't care for the red power light but that's very minor. I'm not thrilled with babying the set for 200 or so hours to avoid IR/burn in but that's with any plasma.Overall, I would rate the picture quality a 9 out of 10, design 8 out of 10, and all the extras a 8.5 out of 10. It's a good set and will hopefully continue to be. These will be out of stock soon so I jumped on it. I couldn't justify paying almost double for the new 50 series especially since there is only minor improvements over the 30 series. After calibration, my eyes can't really see a difference between this and the gt and vt models except a much better bezel. If your thinking about buying one, I would take a chance. I was very skeptical and will be watching like a hawk for anything wrong with it since this is a lot of money for me. I ended up paying just a tad over $1800 with tax (free shipping)and the stupid $10 waste tv fee thing. Also, remember to use an American express card to take advantage of an extra year of warranty coverage.  I wish I could give this 4 and a half stars on Amazons rating because it really is an impressive set with amazing pq with only minor shortcomings.Hope this review has helped and if anything changes, I will update.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for good price", "Author": "SSSS \"sssss\"", "ReviewID": "RPQDT1P5ALV1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV March 2nd. Yes, I was one of the first to get it in my area. Anyway, I waited this long to write a review because I wanted to make sure that this thing did not crap out on me. So far it has been excellent. I reduced the brightness and contrast to around 40 just to break-in the set. the picture quality is amazing. This is my first hdtv, moved from a 22\" crt to this one. Everything worked OOTB including wireless and DLNA from my iOmega NAS. Only issue I have is, it does not do audio for converted/ripped mp4 files. Regular mp4 and mpeg2 files are fine. Not tested 3d, not interested either. I did use some settings recommended by D Nice and Chad in their reviews of this set. I had the floating brightness issue, while watching skiing. I had to turn off the CATS and reduce contrast and brightness. I don't see it anymore. It was shocking at first. Now that I don't see it anymore I don't think about it either. the set has slight buzzing that you can only hear when you go behind the TV to listen to it. In other words, nothing to worry about. there is no way to record a program to the sd card in the slot. It is read only for the TV. Would have been nice if you could also record to it.

I tried an expensive name brand LED lit model first and found the picture bright and bristling but flat and one dimensional. There was no immersion and visual nuance. I'd read the reviews on this so when I returned that set, I got this one. Am I glad I did!The set is basic black in style, heavier literally and visually than the led. However, I'm putting the television in it's spot and there it stays. It's worth it.  The performance is great. I'm so glad Panasonic still offers a great 46in 1080p plasma. SD is quite good and HD is wonderful and immersive. Although the picture is crystal clear, it's a bit less dynamic,than the LED but much more nuanced.Adjustments are easy, the remote is easy albeit not a high end device though not chintzy, it does the trick with ease. I love the Viera Link. The interface can be a little slow, but it's easy and uncluttered. I must say the quality of the streaming is very good, with much of what I watch being SD, the television displays it really well.Glare: - My room has a lot of windows, there's glare. The television swivels and I can turn it away from the windows and the great picture quality stays intact . That LED only looked good from straight on and the screen's matte finish hazes over from the window light, then the picture washed out when viewed at an angle. I'm actually better able to overcome the issue with the Panasonic. I come from the time of the tube. All sets were stationary with reflective glass. Glare was a part of the experience. The brain overlooks it after a while.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buy Me", "Author": "Dusty", "ReviewID": "RQTHYL8E0IMK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I finally completed the arduous process of reading 1000s of TV reviews, I settled on the Viera line. Due to price constraints, I originally purchased a P50S30 (slightly worse stats, no 3D). When the dust settled from my home theater buying spree I loved the TV, but I realized it was now the only piece of equipment I owned that didn't support 3D. After yet more spec comparisons, I returned the TV and purchased the P50ST30 - best decision of my life (recently).Picture: I don't have words. Lifelike doesn't do the picture justice, since the word implies one could discern generated image from real life. After tweaking picture (James Cameron Avatar recommended settings), video looks absolutely amazing. Standard 480 looks a little blurry, but that will happen on any TV this big. 720 looks great, 1080 even better. I would go on and on about the picture, but the TV's specs speak for themselves. I have not noticed any green blobs or other oddities that some report.Glare: Plasmas have more glare than many LEDs, but this TV performs well in bright light. Even when viewing conditions are less than ideal I can still see the picture clearly through the glare.Menus: Same as S series, clean and fairly easy to use. There is a little bit of input lag, but it isn't a big deal - once you set everything up you can quickly change common features. One nice feature is the ability to custom name inputs and channels. Pro picture settings, parental lock, cc, and a few nice anti-image retention features round out the menus nicely. **Make sure you disable Motion Smoothing (adv settings) across all your media, it makes video look very odd.**Internet: Wireless adapter included in box is $100 by itself, so if you were planning on buying one anyway this TV makes even more sense for you. The adapter works well and connects @ 100% to my home network. When you do get the TV networked, you will find the VieraCast menus share a little of the lag as the TV menus. The DLNA implementation has very little support, and while there are a variety of apps available, I had varied success. Netflix gave me a rebuffering issue on my first movie, and the audio seems a bit spotty (occasional pops/crackles). I have experienced none of these issues using the same services through PS3+HDMI connection.Image Retention: I'm going on two weeks since purchase and have noticed no negative effects. For the first week I followed burn in procedures (low contrast, low sharp, no static images) and while I still use their anti-image retention tools, I have since started turning on the juice for movies/games. I recommend using burn in settings for regular TV viewing and better settings with blu rays. Also, limit gaming sessions with static HUD/displays for the first few weeks after TV purchase...better safe than sorry.VieraLink: I paired the TV with a PS3 and Onkyo HT-3400 receiver and it works flawlessly - the TV turns the receiver and PS3 on/off in sync with the TV. It doesn't power on all connected peripherals every time, only the one attached to the current input. For example, if my input was set to antenna when the TV was turned off, it will only turn on the receiver. When input is switched to PS3, it will turn both receiver the PS3 on (and off after an idle period). The Viera remote actually controls basic menu functions within the PS3, so from power on to playing a blu ray I can get away with 1 remote. Great feature IMHO (requires HDMI connections between equipment as well as compatibility).3D: Awesome. I didn't much care about 3D when I set out, but now that I have it, nothing else will do. Getting the correct picture settings is a must! I saw several 3D movies in theaters and then watched them on this TV - the quality is exactly the same. If anything 3D is more enjoyable on the TV (ignoring being at home in jammies), since at the 50\" size characters often look life size. During one late night movie session I nearly had to check for intruders; a character from the movie walked in \"front\" of the the screen and I thought someone was in the room. So far every 3D movie I have watched looks perfect. The TV also upscales nearly any source (have not bothered trying with 480 content) into 3D, so re-watching some of your favorite movies will bring a whole new dimension to the table, literally. Upscaling isn't nearly as delicious as true 3D content, but it works remarkably well for an on-the-fly solution.3D makes your eyes hurt: Yours maybe, but I haven't noticed any problems. I have had extended gaming sessions of 5/6 hours and not noticed a problem. I don't wear glasses nor suffer from eye problems, so I can't speak for everyone, but I doubt that the vast majority will suffer any ill effects. I would, however, not recommend it while nursing a hangover.Gaming: I have a PS3 Slim connected through HDMI, and while I have never been a huge console fan, this TV will help change my mind. Graphics look great and games run smoothly. As for 3D games, WOW. Do research though, like any new technology the rush to pump out content has led to some very sub-par products. The good games however, are AMAZING. Killzone, Crysis2, etc. in 3D are just startling. Everything from the gun's sights having depth to a rocket coming out of the distance and flying past your head make for a surreal gaming experience. As a lifelong FPS fan playing a game like this in 3D makes so much sense. Several other games like GT5 look great and also work well in 3D.Content: There is not a plethora of 3D available yet, but there is enough there for to get on the bandwagon. Movies all look great, and between what's out already and what will be out by the end of the year there will be plenty of options. Cable providers are just starting to carry 3D programming; I have basic cable and no box, but this TV has managed to pickup a digital 3D channel from my provider (not sure if they are intentionally providing it, but I'm not going to complain) For games, you need to be careful - poorly designed games have horrible image issues that can have a negative impact.All things considered, I am thoroughly happy with my purchase, and with Amazon, and would recommend both to those looking for the best in 3D TVs anywhere in this price range. If you don't care about 3D, this TV still boasts specs better than nearly any comparable non 3D panel, and will allow you to try the technology out at a later date.Pros: AboveCons: The ARC (audio return channel) seems to strip my 5.1 surround signal. I originally plugged my PS3 into the TV via HDMI, then picked the audio up on the receiver via the ARC. I was never able to pass the signal through the TV to the receiver with surround, and had to send sound straight to the receiver via optical, not a big deal though.I also felt the TV had mediocre Internet implementation at best. I think this is a secondary concern, however. Firmware updates are always a possibility, and there are plenty of devices that can connect straight to the TV to provide desired services.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very, Very Impressive!", "Author": "Gregg Cornett", "ReviewID": "R2OMN2V725Z5VP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have owned for 6 months, could not imagine a better quality TV in existence. 3D is perfect, resolution unbelievable.

This TVs color has lots of horse power, but it has to be unleashed. The ST30 does not contain the THX certification and the Cinema, and Standard picture modes that come preset will look dull and muted compared to our settings. The Vivid picture mode setting is a joke, with totally blown out with false edges. The Standard setting is obviously to set to qualify Panasonic for energy stars. Of the available preset picture mode options the Cinema setting option is best, but take the time a go to the Pro Settings menu (under Custom Mode only) and follow our settings. One other key to a great picture on this TV is to turn off the Motion Smoother (directions below under features).Once the phosphors are ramped up in the right direction, the colors on this TV really pop. Dark shadow detail is superb, and black levels look saturated though not the best we've seen. There is some background motion artifacts present, no doubt brought to light by increasing phospor output, but it's worth it to see the picture in such fresh detail.3D TV Viewing: Plasma is the best technology for 3D programming since the plasma displays full 1080p HD to each eye. 3D viewing is getting better as evidenced by this display. The flashing from the sides of the 3D glasses which were evident on almost all 3D TVs we tested from last year is all but gone. As well, the blurring in the left and right bottom corners is almost gone. What's left is a picture that gives you a more immersion through the experience. I cant say whether my eyes are just getting more used to the 3D programming or whether the glasses, 3D transmitters, and 3D content quality is what's causing less strain on my eyes when I have viewed 3D programming this year on the Panasonic and Sony TVs. But regardless, it does seem more comfortable and enjoyable.Picture Quality Rating (Non-HD): 8.5/10With our picture settings, the ST30 can bring older DVDs to life like you have never seen them. As mentioned in the HD section they do contain some background motion artifacts and even judder, but the image detail and color will involve you more in the picture. There is also some instability in the picture which was also reflected in our processor testing. It's a bit jumpy no matter your picture setting and has something to do with the sizing algorithm (we think).Features Rating: 8/10Internet Options: Panasonic's Internet suite seems much more robust this year. We were not crazy about the way the Internet menu folds out in layers. It's a bit difficult to navigate rather than seeing them all on one screen. The options include Netflix, MLB, NBA, AP news from different sources, Pandora Internet Radio, You Tube, Accuweather, Amazon VoD, Fox Sports, Facebook and many more. The Apps are much improved with choices ranging from free to $10, and consist mostly of games available for purchase through Viera Connect Market. Skype is an optional included feature if you purchase the TY-CC10W camera to support it.TV Appearance: This year's ST30 is a minor improvement over its predecessor in design appeal. The depth of the panel is just a little over 2\" when including the bottom speaker area. It's only 1.5\" deep in the top 90% of the panel so from the side viewing angel it looks a lot thinner than its peak 2.3\". It will not win any awards for best design of 2011, but is \"just good enough\" in the looks department not to get a downgraded score in this area. The frame is 1.2\" in width which is a big improvement over the imposingly wide bezel frames from last years Panasonic plasmas. It does not contain infinity glass over the top of the bezel frame. The bottom left and right corners slope inward slightly to add a little design and keep the TV from appearing as a big rectangular box.Audio Output: The 50ST30 includes 2 X 10Watt speakers. We were impressed in many ways by the sound quality on the ST30. It yields a fuller, richer sound than most thin TVs. Give the tradeoff between a bit more TV depth at the bottom back of the TV to allow for better speakers, I would take that choice every time (unless of course I planned to listen to everything through a home theater system). The speakers add .8\" to the depth of the TV and it's a good deal.Value Rating: 9/10See the full written review along with our video review at 3D TV Buying Guide", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "'Let the bodies hit the floor!!' -- A gamer's review", "Author": "DiGiTaLdAzE", "ReviewID": "RYFVYFD2M9GQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using the 50 inch ST30 for almost 3 months now. I use it on my PC to play various FPS games--military, survival-horror and other such games, thus the title of my review--lol. I also play flight Sims such as 'Lock-On Modern Air Combat', 'Wings of Prey' and 'Flight Sim X' which look amazing on a 50 inch plasma! Wanting to upgrade from my 27\" LCD monitor, I originally purchased a TC-L37DT30 Panasonic 37\" 3D LED TV--2011 model from Amazon. I found the LED lighting rather harsh on my eyes, and so I sold it to a friend. I also decided I wanted to go BIGGER!! So, I picked up the 50\" inch plasma--it was a very good move. For starters, the plasma is much easier on the eyes as claimed on the Panasonic website. Because of near sightedness I end up sitting quite close to the set sometimes, so this was important for me.Compatibility for use on a PC: when I was doing my research I could not get any clear info from Panasonic as to whether it would work properly going from HDMI on my graphics card to HDMI on the ST30. I did not want to use the VGA port on the TV and thereby be limited to an analog signal. I can report that HDMI to HDMI works perfectly fine in my case. I am using an 'Abacus' 6 foot cable purchased from Amazon which I can confirm will support proper 3D and Blu Ray playback. Also, they are cheap--under $10. However, it may be necessary to insure that your graphics card is HDCP (high definition copy protection) compliant--my nVidia GTX 580 is. if not you may get a black screen when going HDMI to HDMI--I'm not sure. There is an nVidia website that gives a list of TVs and cards in their lineup that will work HDMI to HDMI, and properly support 3D. Just 'Google' nVidia TV list, and go to the first link. From there select 'System Requirements', and then select 'Supported 3D TVs'.Screen uniformity on the plasma is much better than that seen on the DT30 LED, which was an excellent set, but did have some minor back light bleed. This seems to be a problem inherent with LCD/LED displays, as the last 3 I have had all had some degree of back light bleed. I can view the ST30 from just about any angle without any loss of picture quality. The black levels on this set are outstanding. In dark games like 'Dead Space' it looks truly awesome giving a much enhanced sense of immersion in the game. I have also done quite a lot of multi-player gaming online, including the 'Battlefield 3' beta last October. I can report with confidence that there does not seem to be any issue with input lag.Re image retention and burn in: The shooter game(s) I have played have a static HUD and other content (game map, etc.) on the screen. Initially I started with very short sessions in such games, and gradually increased the duration as I became confident that the set was not being adversely effected. I now occasionally play for as much as 3 hours straight with this HUD on screen and have seen NO image retention or burn in at all. Most of these longer sessions were in online game play, and about every 25 minutes or so there is a map change/refresh on the server which gets rid of the HUD for maybe 90 seconds--I don't think that is a long enough break to make any difference. Initially I ran the anti image retention scrolling bar after such long sessions, but don't bother any more. So for gamers I would highly recommend the ST30.3D VS. 2D--Just a quick note here: several Panasonic techs all told me that the picture quality in 2D mode is better on the 3D sets than the 2D picture on 2D sets that they manufacture. This is why I decided to get a 3D set, even though it cost a bit more. When I had the DT30 LED set which is 3D I determined that I was unable to see images in 3D on these sets--probably because one of my eyes has lower vision than the other. I went 3D anyways because I wanted the best possible 2D picture in games. I did not want to pay the extra $$ for the GT or VT series, but Panasonic told me that the ST picture was comparable in quality to those higher lines.Re 'Break In' during first hours of use: Panasonic tech told me to follow the following procedure--they said that it would help to diminish any chance of burn in or image retention later on. Run the ST30 in 'standard' picture mode at default settings (low contrast and brightness) for the first 100 hours. I went one step further, and downloaded a program (it's free--use google) that runs a series of solid color screens staying with the above recommended settings as well. I followed this routine for around 125 hours with about 20% of that given to regular viewing (movies, and web browsing still always in 'standard' picture mode) and the rest to the color slides. I believe that following the above 'break in' method might have helped the set's performance re having no burn in or image retention in the FPS games I play.There are some online calibration pros who recommend 'torching' the phosphors during 'break in' by running the color slides with high brightness and contrast in 'Vivid' picture mode for the first 100 hours of use in order to gain the best picture quality with proper calibration down the line. This seemed counter intuitive to me, and I decided to follow the advice given by Panasonic tech support. For gamers at least I would advise to do the same, and avoid the high contrast-brightness approach during 'break in'.Sound--I would never consider to use the speakers on a unit like this. If you want the audio portion of your experience to match the video quality the ST30 will provide, this set deserves to be coupled with a stand alone audio system. In my case that involves A Yamaha AX-900U 'Natural Sound' integrated amp, and 2 Cerwin-Vega RE 30 floor standing speakers--all older components which definitely out perform what these companies market today. This audio gear is running through the integrated sound card on my eVGA e770 motherboard using Realtek sound drivers. Along with the ST30 it provides a very immersive experience in games. To downgrade such a set based on the sound quality provided by the built in speakers as a few reviews have makes no sense to me--I actually have the TV audio disabled.After buying this unit I picked up a Panasonic blu-ray player, and have been picking up some movies. Needless to say the set looks outstanding watching such media. previous to getting this set I was gaming and watching movies on a 27 inch Hanns-G LCD monitor. This purchase has been a HUGE enhancement of my set up. BTW, avoid Hanns-G like the plague--they ripped me off when my still in warranty monitor developed problems.In closing, my set arrived in perfect condition with no defects. No Fbr, no green blobs, etc. So long as it doesn't 'die' on me unexpectedly I am VERY happy with this purchase, and am definitely a 'plasma' convert. I got mine at 'B&H; photo' because at the time their price was better. Price not being an issue, I would highly recommend Amazon--their customer support is second to none.___________________________________", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really really wanted to keep it, but returned it", "Author": "JohnnyH1979", "ReviewID": "R247U0F9T69LQR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture quality is fantastic, the sound is pretty good (not that I am a audiophile).

I knew the set could have brightness issues, as stated by many here, and I was right... it did. It was pretty bad actually, but not one I'd throw a hammer at the screen for. I checked the service screen for the EEP update number and it was not up-to-date. I called concierge service and had them walk me through the steps. Nothing fixed it and they sent a tech out to fix it in less than a week. When he arrrived, he put me through the hoops, but I just told him that I noticed that it was about 2 updates behind. He popped the SD card in, uploaded it, then restarted it. Perfect. No problems now at all. May as well be brand new.The tech noted that my unit had been serviced previously, had the A-board replaced. Problem was that the tech that replaced it didn't have the authorization to update to the most recent EEPROM (only official Panasonic tech can mess with that stuff), so it was not properly fixed... completely. That was why the set got returned. This thing is brand spankin new, no scratches.

It doesn't have a search function (that I can find), so you can't look for specific movies.

I could not go more than 50\" where the TV was to be viewed. Strange that most LCD TV's do not come in 50\" viewing size?Most larger LCD's jumped from 47\" to 55\". But in the middle were some plasma's at 50\"! So I searched for the best possible fit both dollar and quality and came down to this TV.Pro's: Fantastic color and picture quality in high def....now I mean only high def here. Beats out any LCD in this price range ($925). Sharper Blue Ray DVD experience! Easy to get around the control menu. The Wi-Fi apps are great. Plenty to choose from.Con's: Poor standard definition quality. I mean poor! There is a big difference in standard broadcast to HD broadcast. Most of my watching via Direct TV is 90% HD anyway. I mean on HD the picture is extremely superb!An LCD on a  \"standard def\" channel would beat this out hands down BUT on high def channels this is clearly the best.Also, after viewing LCD TV for the last 5 years and seeing white's very very \"white\", this plasma has a trade off, whites are \"washed\" on this, they are grayer. Yet, blacks are blacker. I noticed this more on commercials that use white backgrounds like the Progressive commercials, very washed out whites. You can't get rid of that.I am very satisfied with my purchase as it fit's my viewing experience. This TV is made for HD movies watching, sports, discovery channel and Bly-Ray. If you compare this in a store have the sales person switch to a standard def channel if possible, Then compare it to another TV.I also got a 5 year in home warranty to cover any problems.

So much for the free shipping only taking 5-8 days.  It took over 3 weeks and when they did deliver my son and his friend had to unload it unpack it and set it up.

Bought from Amazon, it arrived quickly and in perfect condition and the delivery driver helped me bring it inside and helped me open it to make sure it was ok before signing for it. The TV is used for typical family content (movies, TV, & sports) from DirecTV HD-DVR and blu-ray playter, and has ~500hours on it.While the finish of the bezel is not anywhere near as elegant as my TC-P65VT30 it is more than adequate, if a bit understated. The TV is thin and looks great mounted on the wall. Again, at this price point, for a plasma with great picture quality that supports 3D... this set is a bargain, and the looks are just fine. I would have preferred a metal bezel, but there is nothing that sticks out as bad with the looks of this thing.I had no problem adjusting this TV to get a great resulting picture. I couldn't believe how great the picture quality was on this TV from day one, especially considering it came at such a great price point. With tuned in settings the colors are deep and rich but not over saturated, the blacks and shadow detail were tremendous, and the 3D looked amazing. My family and I enjoyed this TV with none of the problems that others have complained about (green \"blobs\", buzzing, IR/Burn-in, fluctuating brightness) for the first 450 or so hours. Then, as if someone flipped a switch... smack, here comes the fluctuating brightness. I started to notice it on several older movies, and thought that it was just because the content was older. As the days went it on it got worse and starting presenting itself on more and more content, including movies that we had watched before with no problems. At this point it is now hard to watch a movie or TV show that has any kind of quick scene change from a dark scene to a brighter scene because of these fluctuations. If they happened gradually it would be fine and would not be noticed, or if they happened immediately at the scene change it would be fine as well. As it is, when the scene changes as described above, there is a brightness shift approximately half a second afterwards.I've watched the same content on an LCD that I have in my bedroom, from the same source and do not see these fluctuations. I have also watched this same content, from the same source, on my TC-P65VT30 and do not see these fluctuations. There is clearly something wrong this set, however from reading others experiences.. Panasonic is claiming that this is normal and within spec, and is a design \"feature\". Really? I have a call in to Panasonic now, and am waiting to hear back. It is a shame because this TV was such a great deal and looked so great at the start, in fact it still looks great.. but it is hard to watch and enjoy it with these problems.Unfortunately if Panasonic cannot get this taken care of with a software update, this TV will be relegated to a gaming set for the kids to use with the Xbox. I'm not pleased.EDIT/UPDATE: Since posting my original review, Panasonic has come forward and really stepped up to the plate.  Engineer's took on all reports regarding the fluctuating brightness problems, worked with calibration experts in the field, and have developed a fix.  There are two options available for fixing the fluctuating brightness: #1. A Panasonic representative can come to your house and install a software fix (this is a flash to the core software on the TV) using an SD card.  #2. Panasonic can send an authorized service center to replace the A-board of the TV with a new one that already contains the updated/fixed software.  It is at Panasonic's discretion (mostly dependent to availability of Panasonic field reps).  In my case I got the software fix, but I know many others who have had the A board replacement and have seen the same results as I have.When the Panasonic rep came to my house, we watched content to show the problem, the rep then followed his procedure and flashed the firmware on both TV's.  After the software upgrades we watched the exact same content we watched just 10 minutes earlier, and the fluctuations were gone.  It has now been 4 days since the update and I have yet to see any remaining fluctuations/problems.Panasonic has stated that they are incorporating this fix into all newly produced 2011 sets starting with August builds, and will fix any TV's that have already been purchased of produced prior to that.  If you have already have a set with this problem, contact Panasonic Viera Concierge immediately and they will get you taken care of.Panasonic should be very much applauded for taking care of this problem, I am extremely pleased with not on the the TV's, but with this resolution.

McCravy", "ReviewID": "R38P9Q4HCPMHWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My relative, who works in the industry, says Panasonic makes the best plasma panels bar none. I took his advice along with the many other favorable reviews and went with the 55ST30 and couldn't be happier. I was not impressed with the 3D displays in the big box stores and since I usually don't care for gimmicks I thought I'd never use the 3D option. Wrong! Not only does the Panny deliver an amazing 2D picture but the 3D is just stunning. My set came with two pair of glasses and the Avatar 3D disc.  Watching this movie was an out of body experience for me. I predict that within 3 years all large screen HDTV sets will have 3D as a standard feature.Plasma, IMO, is superior to LCD/LED because it had deeper blacks, better contrast and better off axis viewing. Due to it's higher refresh rate, motion in sports is more life like with less lag time than found in LCD/LED. The Panny may well be the gold standard in these areas.I was, however, slightly disappointed that the Panny was unable to stream a movie using it's wireless dongle 25 feet from the router. In all fairness this could be due to limited bandwidth from my PC/router. I had already run ethernet cable ( cheap cat5 wire ) under my house which is always a better solution than wireless. Hard wiring the Panny, Blu-ray player and AV receiver to the router via one cat5 cable and a $12 switcher makes for huge video and audio options on the internet. Having a variety of apts from every component in my system is also worthwhile.Sound wise the Panny is no better or worse than other panels. But no one should have such as a great picture without equally good sound. Please don't waste money on a sound bar or system in a box but instead spring for a decent 5.1/7.1 receiver paired with good speakers and a sub. That's the only way to get full enjoyment of the HT experience.Rarely do you read complaints of having a screen size too large. Usually it's the opposite. I've found that the 55ST30 ( 55 inch )is perfect for viewing distances of 10 to 13 feet while a 50 inch might be too small.The 55ST30 weighs a hefty 80 lbs so I think wall mounting would be more difficult than with the lighter LCDs. I bought a great looking $199 stand from Sams that fits the Panny perfectly and has room for all components plus a center channel speaker.Reflections from the large glossy bezel and screen have been mentioned as negatives but some room darkening inner curtains and spring rods from Walmart will fix that.I purchased the 55ST30 from Amazon and shipping, delivery, and set up was a breeze. The freight lines called and set up an appointment and then brought the set inside on hand trucks. The delivery guy opened the box, placed the set on my stand and plugged it in. Had it not worked he would have taken it back on the spot and a replacement would been ordered.I usually show little brand loyalty but Panasonic for me has been a cut above the rest and has stood the test of time.

The proper way to do this for those who are interested is to download the slides on to a SD card or USB flashdrive, and insert the card or the Flash drive on to the TV, then click on viera tools and play them as a slideset using the inbuilt viera Media player, and run them continuously for 100 hrs(i would periodically rest the plasma for 2hrs every 2 days) using D-nice's specifications(these are the initial specs for breakin(very easy), then after the break-in period, i calibrated the color settings as per D-nice recommendations, overall, i am blown away by the vivid colors, My tv is in a well lit room, and doesnt have any noticeable glare,(this is a weak point for most plasmas). I also bought a Panny Bluray on amazon and am very happy to be able to use my TV remote to control the Bluray/DVD player.  I haven't tested the 3D yet, and honestly my reason for purchase is the 2D picture. The reason 3D tv's have better 2D pictures, is that they need more powerful processors to render the 3 D images, and these processors then are very useful for giving a very good 2D image, this rule generally applies to most TV's, the TV's that we see today do a lot of processing to give their images and cover-up for their inherent screen deficiencies (lcd-poor angle and contrast, LED looks too bt=right and colors need to be toned down a little, plasma-prevent burin etc).  The Audio is average and would probably need an upgrade to a dedicated speaker system in the future, but this will do for now.  I am very happy with the panny plasma and would definitely recommend buying this TV on Amazon and using D-nice settings on highdef junkies forum for the TV, these steps are very easy to do and have made a good difference in the picture quality before and after the changes..", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very impressed, excellent TV", "Author": "Deathtwinkie", "ReviewID": "R184ZSBR6KI79R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many others, I did my research before deciding on this set.  I'm not a videophile but do watch a lot of movies.  I'm not going to pay hundreds for a professional calibration vs just using the World of Wonder disc and my own eye like I've already done.  I can't imagine several hundred dollars worth of extra picture quality is going to be had vs. what I already see.The TV is light, only 76lbs and with the included base is 86lbs, and the included wide stand screws in and installs in less than 2mins.  The stand is so easy to put on and secure that even my cat could have done it.  The TV is performing great, but it's still in it's break in period.NOTE:  I recommend immediately setting the picture settings per input and take that contrast way down from the default 100 (max) setting it's sitting at.  That's showroom settings and especially during breakin, the last thing you want is the contrast or picture settings maxxed.  It will eat into the life of the TV and unnecessarily uses more power.  From the PS3 bluray, I popped in the Disney's World of Wonder calibration disc and tried my best to set the right levels on the TV.  There's really only 4-6 settings to mess with.  This is what's called a consumer calibration, the easy one.  The professional $300 kind involves going into the service menu, blah blah.  I don't know, unless someone can reply back to me and tell me the merits or value of having this done over the consumer level adjustments, then I'll just stick with this.  The picture is excellent, just like everyone else here is saying.The settings I run are I leave the TV in custom mode and I think the settings I rule are close to this:Contrast:  60Brightness:  55Color:  60Tint:  unchangedSharpness:  60To my eye, these look vivid but not overly so, slight increase in sharpness but nothing crazy, and fiddled around with contrast and brightness so much in the WOW calibration disc that I just settled on these settings.  The black level was set perfectly, however the white levels for some reason can't be adjusted enough for me to get the ideal level that the WOW disc said I should be seeing.  Only a minor issue.  When I get home again i'm going to find a THX pixar/disney movie and try those THX test patterns to see if I should change the Contrast/Brightness again.But I watched Avatar and Predator so far and both were incredible.  It's not just the picture settings and 1080p bluray that makes it incredible, but this TV also automatically smooths out the picture slightly (the 600hz feature I imagine) and this gives it that \"real\" \"looking through a window\" effect that alot of people like.  LCD's do similar things with their 120/240hz feature.  Too much of this feature, and people call that \"soap opera\" effect meaning they don't like it too smooth.  Personally, to me, we get expensive speakers so that we can be \"there\" as best as we can to the live recording.  We get expensive TV's, so that we can be \"there\" as well I'd imagine.  I don't understand people that like to always have their movies be 24/30 frames per second and never want that changed.  To me, that's not realistic, it keeps you aware that you're just watching a movie.  You go outside and you also hope your eyes were running at 24/30 FPS?  What I'm saying is that, in video and audio, we are after realism, likelife realism and a smoother picture gets you that much closer.So that's the most dramatic thing about this set, the black levels are dark, very dark and that's why I turned up the vividness just a tad by increasing the \"Color\" setting to 60 instead of 50.  I wanted it a tad more vivid.  Slightly increased Brightness and Contrast too, but nothing close to VIVID mode which has Contrast cranked to 100 ;)Anyway, let me know if you have better settings I should try, but there's no noise from my set, only watched some blurays so far, black level is incredible and the picture quality is out of this world.  My roommate has a 42\" panasonic and just a few minutes of watching Avatar, and later Predator, he was out the next day trying to get the same set from Bestbuy regardless of the anger it will generate from his wife.  The smoothness and picture quality (after adjusted settings) are great.  I haven't tried the 3D yet however.Predator was incredible too.  I thought because of an old movie that it wouldn't be as good, but in 1080p, the color and smoothness of that jungle, the hair on their face detail, the color, was all incredible.  It was very smooth and lifelike, yet I was seeing more vivid colors that I hadn't seen before.

I knew my price limit and decided to look at plasma and LED screens.  Pretty much narrowed down the hunt to LG and Samsung, both are quality screens with decent reviews.  Then I stumbled upon this model.There are time where customer reviews are too good to be true.  But in the case of this Panasonic screen,  I could not find a consistent string of below average ratings for other sites.  Based on consumer reviews and CNETs praising of the screen, I decided to jump in.Ordered it from Amazon and had it delivered by Pilot within 3 days from ordering.  The crew was professional and very helpful.  I decided not to use the 'white glove' service of unpacking the the screen and setting it up as I was capable of doing that myself (with the help of son : ) ).  TV arrived undamaged, shipping box clean of dents or any other external marks that would indicate to me the screen was treated roughly during shipment.  I would recommend the white glove service if you cannot manage the setup yourself as the 50inch screen is bulky to handle by yourself.I installed the solid metal mounts (heavy casted aluminum bracket and strong sheetmetal base) using the supplied instructions.  No problem with that step.  Please note it is a two person job positioning the screen onto the stand so please do not try and be a Superman and man-handle it yourself.  Get help!This TV has the HDMI 'ARC' connection setup.  Reading about is more confusing that what it actually does for you.  Basically it is an intelligent communication protocol that eliminates the rat nest of cables between devices and a 'remote controller basket' next to your the chair.  Using your controller you can control other devices like Blu-ray/DVD players without jumping through hoops figuring out what button to push on what controller to do something.  I was pleasantly surprised that my Samsung Blu-Ray player synched fine with the ARC protocol and I was able to control basic functions on the player using the screen's remote.  No special coding or secret handshakes were required to get it working.I have the Panasonic sound bar (SC-HTB10) that is ARC compatible and integrates well into the system.  Using a HDMI cable between it and the 'ARC' HDMI port on the screen, it will automatically turn on/off the sound bar and adjusts the volume appropriately.  Basically I daisy-chained the DVD player's HDMI to the sound bar, (yes I typed correctly) and then I connect the sound bar to the screen's ARC HDMI port.  (The sound bar has its own power supply so it plugs into the wall.)  The screen's speakers are OK, but if you are really into the audio side of things, you may want to consider this option.(I have my sound bar attached to the top of the screen to prevent any issues with the IR remove receiver on the front of the screen.  There are reports that unless you elevate the screen, the bar will block the receiver.)To say the screen is outstanding is an understatement!  Out of the box the defaults are great and I have not seen any issues with them.  If you are bold, there are several sites that can walk you through a 'custom' setup to really tweek the output of this screen!If you are concerned about pixelization or 'bug noise' because of the high-speed motion (read sports), don't be.  Watching basketball and football five feet away from the screen showed NO noise .  I am impressed!Did not buy the TV for internet access so I cannot tell you pros or cons of it.  I can tell you though it was easy to hook up to a wireless router with a encryption key.So in summaryPros- Color  10/10- Refresh  10/10- Audio  5/10  (works ok but consider a sound bar etc)- ARC hook up (this is a gem, what don't others have it ?)- U-verse remote synched up fine with it- Free Delivery (Pilot)- Price Match (Amazon stood behind their price-match policy as a day after buying it, I found it for $95 cheaper - from Amazon!  A simple email and I was credited the difference.)Cons- Weight (not easy to move around by yourself)- Audio (again, try it first in your environment before passing judgement)- Early reviews whined about brightness cycling.

Proulx \"Up to my Neck in Tech\"", "ReviewID": "R24YWPB1QCM51L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this TV a few weeks ago. So far I've been nothing but thrilled with it! I love that it has Amazon VOD, Netflix, Pandora, and more internet features to choose from. The Amazon VOD is especially high quality, better so than the Netflix streaming.The design of the TV is nice, despite others who say it is clunky. Sure it isn't ridiculously thin, but I didn't expect it to be (I'm coming from an old school TV). The menus are simple and easy to operate. The picture quality looks great. I haven't tried out the 3D feature, but I am looking forward to being able to up convert 2D shows to 3D. From the comments I have read, the fluctuating brightness problem is a thing of the past and doesn't affect models past August 2011 (and those prior have been fixed with firmware updates to my knowledge).One feature I really like is the fact that the remote is able to operate my Sony BDV-E570 Blu-ray Player Home Entertainment System. Despite the fact that the Blu-ray player is not Panasonic, the \"Viera link\" feature of this TV is really just Panasonic's version of CEC (Consumer Electronics Control), which means that it is pretty well compatible with other newer home theater accessories. For example, when I turn on the TV, my Blu-ray player/receiver and sound system turn on. I can access the Blu-ray menu and it's IPTV and other features by pressing the \"Viera Link\" button and selecting \"Player\" which activates the menu system on the player. Then the left, right, enter buttons are all forwarded to the player. Also, when playing a Blu-ray or DVD, the TV's remote works to pause, play, fast forward, etc. The equivalent of the menu button (to access the DVD's top menu and other options) is the \"Sub-menu\" button on this remote. In other words, don't think that just because you are getting a TV that is a different brand than your Blu-ray player that they won't cooperate, they most likely will if they support CEC.As for setting this up, if you search online you will find that a person named D-nice has put together a couple threads with specific settings to use for a 100 hour period of slides that you play on the TV to evenly age the phosphors. This allows all the pixels to age evenly and gets you past that 100 hour period in which you have to be careful about watching images with static logos or black bars. Then he has a set of calibrated color settings to use after the slides. So after getting this TV and letting it warm up to room temperate, I transferred those slides (just jpegs) to a USB, plugged it in, set up the display settings, and kept the TV playing for 4 days straight. It probably wasn't necessary (and made me very impatient), and I don't know that I would have known the difference, but it is nice knowing I have a better calibrated picture. So check it out if you are curious. The thread I used was titled \"2011 Panasonic Settings/Issues Thread\" on the highdefjunkies site. On page 63 of the thread someone summarized everything you need to know about the process.My only complaints are that the TV has a red LED on all the time to show that the TV is on (I cover it with a speaker), and I have found no way to turn off the display when I am just listening to Pandora. Also the internet takes a few seconds to reconnect after turning the TV on. When watching YouTube, there is no way to fast forward or rewind in a clip. You do not seem to be able to change aspect ratio/format when using Viera Connect. Finally, the Wifi adapter sticks out past the bezel if you use it without the extension cable (I just use an ethernet cable).Overall, this is an awesome TV. I love it!

Banks", "ReviewID": "R3OWGK96R4F5QU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Typical of many reviewers, I researched large screen TVs for literally months. You might even say years because putting together a 50+\" home theater system has been a dream of mine for a while.When you walk into a big-box electronics store like H.H. Gregg or Best Buy the new generation of LEDs look the best because of their bright screens. When you look at a plasma TV like a Panasonic 60\" VIERA beside an LED it looks like it has a gray-ish film over it. So it isn't surprising my top pick in TVs (I tend to be a Sony guy but their LEDs are unimpressive) was the new Sharp Quattron. After countless visits to various stores, the only thing keeping me from getting a Sharp was the price. Even though there isn't such a thing as an LED TV, per se, since they're LCDs with LED backlighting, the retailers and manufacturers are asking a premium mark-up on them.Many of my co-workers, many salesmen and many on-line reviews kept harping on plasma for far better color accuracy at a bargain price. I kept looking at plasma and I kept struggling to accept it because they consistently looked a bit dingy. However, I saw this Panasonic model at a Best Buy being clearanced as a floor model and the picture blew me away. Long story short, I took a chance and assumed with some adjustment I could get a picture I liked.I've had the TV for 2 months but wanted to wait before posting a review. The 1st couple of days I had the Panasonic I doubted my decision as playing with the brightness didn't help at all. In fact, the brightness control didn't work the way I expected. However, accidentally I flipped through various built-in modes and found a factory \"bright\" (I think it's called) pre-set. While not everything was right with the picture settings, it cleared up the darkness issue. Reviewing what the factory had done, I discovered the secret to getting the sort of spot-on brightness I wanted was to up the contrast. I have it set at 80. The factory used a setting of 100 which probably will work for many. Bottom line, the gray dullness is gone and it easily blows away the 36\" Sony Bravia LCD I have in my study. Don't get me wrong. The Sony remains a quite nice TV I use a lot, particularly gaming.When you compare, say, the color of grass on an in-store demo of plasmas and LEDs the LED, at first, looks more pleasing. Why? Because it's a bright green that pops; whereas, the plasma looks like real, lush dark green grass you see in the real world. I was commenting to a Best Buy salesman how much better the Best Buy logo looked on an LED when he pointed out to me that, in fact, the LED didn't accurately render their logo and he proved it by pointing to a logo on his shirt. True enough, when I went home and looked at my Sony Bravia it dawned on me I'd toned down all the color settings to pretty much how the plasmas look by default when I originally set it up. Obviously, this is all a matter of personal taste.One 'problem' I have is the Panasonic is turning me into a movie hound. I got a Panasonic Blu-ray player for it and obviously Blu-ray discs are amazing on it. I watched \"Super 8\" last night and it's like having a little theater in my home. I'm so spoiled by the Panasonic it's zapped me of any interest in seeing a movie in a theater.I don't have any 3D discs (I'm supposed to get \"Avatar\" free from Panasonic sometime in the near future) but I have been able to view 3D movies on HBO's on-demand. I don't have name-brand Panasonic 3D glasses but the pair of knock-offs I have are quite nice. The 3D affects vary by source. The best 3D affects weren't in a Hollywood blockbuster like \"Clash of the Titans\" or \"Despicable Me\" but a documentary on Egyptian mummies of all things. Anyway, I find the 3D to be pretty good. If a 3D version of a movie was available I'd be inclined to try it over the standard format. I'm glad I got it on my TV but I'm not 100% sold on it (mainly because of the proprietary nature of glasses).Eventually, I expect 3D will hit prime-time and you won't need glasses. Meanwhile, you can get some TVs like LG's line-up that uses the cheap 3D passive glasses like they use at theaters. However, the LG glasses gave me a very bad headache after only about 10 minutes. Panasonic active technology doesn't bother me at all. Your mileage may vary so you need to check this out for yourself. I will say the LG in-store demo is probably the most impressive of all the brands I tested including Panasonic, Sony, Samsung and Sharp.The sound on the TV is fine for general use. However, I set up a 5.1 home home theater component system since I plan to use the Panasonic mostly to watch movies, football, and other big events. For something this large, I can't imagine not upgrading to at least a budget home theater in a box.I have my Panasonic hooked up to the Internet via Ethernet but, frankly, won't use this feature except for upgrades. I have my Panasonic Blu-ray running through a 5.1 Onkyo tuner so I use it for online content like Amazon's Prime videos. The TV did come with a USB wi-fi unit (which I didn't realize was a feature when I purchased it). I did try to set up the wireless dongle but I have a strong password for my router's WPA and the Panasonic remote doesn't support all the characters I need. Rather than change the password, I just hooked the TV up to a 4-port switch I already had.The bottom line is I have no problem giving this TV my highest recommendation.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV!", "Author": "Dave the rave", "ReviewID": "R1BZTPJX814G2N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I returned an LG 55LW5600 LED TV to get this panasonic plasma.  This is the TV I wanted in the first place...but I was lured in by the lower priced 3d glasses.  Originally, I did not even care about 3d but when looking at TV reviews, its nearly impossible to find a highly rated tv that is NOT 3d, so I decided to go with the LG.  But I was concerned about the possibility of motion blur/artifacts, etc. with the LCD.  The picture on the LG was great, but it did contain too much blur/artifacts for me, especially since I use the TV for sports..  So I took advantage of the great Amazon return policy and then got the panasonic ST30 series 60\" plasma!  Finally...what I wanted!!  Awesome picture with no issues!  Other users and other reviews mention dim picture. This is true before doing any kind of calibration.  The vivid setting is bright, but too overdone..  Go to [...] They have great calibration settings for this TV.  After I used theirs for the custom mode, I then adjusted the cinema mode a bit along with standard... They look great.The contrast with pure blacks is outstanding!  I did not think I could notice this without having the LG side by side with the Panasonic, but I sure can!  Real deep blacks with crispy clean picture.  Also, the SD picture on this is FAR superior to the LCD.  I've heard this may be true when comparing any plasma to LCD..but I thought it was worth noting.  I have only watched \"Cars 2\" Blu Ray, but of course it was awesome picture.  I have also just played PS3 Madden 12 and need for speed 2 with my son!  UNBELIEVABLE graphic detail on madden 3.  Mind you, I'm not a serious gamer...but to see the metallic paint shimmer in the helmets and the reflections of stadium lights in helmets is crazy detail.  Need for speed was awesome, and at times, the landscape speeding by looked like video to some degree..Regarding the 3d, I have not yet tried it yet. Again...this was not as important to me as a great picture.  But soon I will get some OEM glasses and I\"m expecting just as spectacular a picture.The VIERA wireless system is great.  Easy to use for the most part. Typing passwords on a keypad of course is lame..but once your signed in to say Amazon video, you don't need to do again.  The HD video on Amazon on demands is great, and the SD is not bad either..  Very surprised.. There are a whole bunch of apps on there, but we will probably only use the Amazon, maybe the weather app at times and possibly one or two others.  It is sort of dumb that the wireless usb stick sticks out of the side of the TV unless you also use the included extension wire.  Bad design idea adding an unnecessary additional cable.I have this system hooked up to Yamaha VX371 receiver with HDMI passing the video signal from my comcast cable box, into the reciever, then to TV's ARC input.  Bluray also done this way.  I'm not happy with the reciever due to some issues the way it does switching with audio..seems to be a problem.  But i just let you know here how its hooked up and the picture is aweseome with the HDMI passing through a low to mid price receiver.  Not sure if it would be even better direct from cable box to TV or with better receiver.I mounted this on the wall using a CHeetah Mount with double swing arms.  TV is heavy and my kids held one side to lift as I held the other.  Mount works great and the TV really looks great on the wall.  I noticed when researching this TV there were \"poor marks\" for design.  I dont know if you can call a black frame thats about 1-1/2 inches a bad design.  I guess thats when you start to get insanely picky when comparing similar models.  Don't let that make the decision for you.  PICTURE QUALITY is the most important in my mind.Now....regarding the main issue on amazon about fluctuating brightness.  This was my only fear in ordering this TV...but I did see that panasonic was fixing or had fixed.  When I got the TV it had a mfg date of May 2011.  But I have not seen any of this issue.  Unless i can't notice, or I just got lucky.  I will update this later if it changes.  Also interesting was that there was a great page inserted with instructions called the Panasonic Concierge.  It had 800# listed with info thanking you for purchase and asking to call with any questions/concerns.  Wondering if this was due to fluctuation issue?  Nice touch anyway..Hope this review helps those on the fence.

Of all the in-store displays I have seen, and I have seen many of them, some with very impressive displays, THIS TV is at the head of the pack! I have never seen images as dazzling and rich as this model. I read some reviews here, before we plugged it in that, that caused me concern about picture fading or inconsistencies in contrast and brightness. I can't imagine what they're talking about, because I have experienced nothing-less-than a magnificent picture.BUT... you cannot experience what I have if:1.) You do not have a Cable or Satellite HD Receiver. and/or2.) The room where your TV is, has windows or is very bright. This will, obviously, not be a problem at night.Where the above Point # 1 is concerned, I know someone who sells these TV's. He hears complaints from unsatisfied buyers have NO HD Receiver, and yet they expect to see the same vivid and spectacular images that they saw in the store. I also HIGHLY recommend use of an HDMI cable to connect the TV to the Receiver, as opposed to standard RCA cables. This will significantly add to the display quality!Where lighting is concerned, we have placed this TV in a room that has no windows that face the screen. That detail MAY explain some of the faded picture comments that I have read. I understand that plasma screens work best without competition from windows.Since I first published this review, I have purchased (iTrek) 3D glasses. Please read my 5-Star review for these rechargeable glasses. Let me just tell you: the 3D is breath-taking! On a negative note, this TV boasts the ability to simulate 3D from 2D sources, but I have not found this feature to be anywhere near as effective as I hoped. I tried it once or twice and was not impressed. But, if your Cable or Satellite Service offers 3D channels, you are in for a real treat!The Viera also boasts Wifi, and gives you the ability to run Netflix, Youtube and Hulu and a few other Internet movie sites, with NO need for a computer or game system middleman connection!Bottom line: If a 65\" TV is within your budget, I HIGHLY recommend this model. If it is too pricey, then go with a smaller screen, but the Panasonic Viera is the way to go! Two thumbs, WAY UP!!!If you buy this, you will not be sorry...

I was worried about the delivery method and how to return it in the case it did not function properly. I am happy to say that both concerns were groundless. The television works perfectly. The picture is excellent. I bought this TV to replace a 5 year old Panasonic 42\" plasma. I moved the old TV into another room where it will continue its good service. The picture on this new set is much better, possibly because of the larger screen size. The facial tones, IMHO, are excellent and the background colors are bright and crisp. I have read about Panasonics brightness fluctuation and so far I have not seen it. At this moment I cannot try out the 3D performance as I do not have a 3D Blu-Ray player. I hope to rectify that by Christmas. I reviewed the plasma TV's in the forums, consumer reports, and other magazines. That along with my own experience with Panasonic Plasma TV's convinced me to stay with Panasonic and the ST line in particular. I was lucky enough to get this TV from Amazon during the black friday weekend and saved anywhere from $150 to $250 over a local purchase. That was what prompted me to take a chance on purchasing on-line. Amazon said the delivery was \"White Glove\" but until I offered a tip the the delivery person was not going to do much more then allow me to inspect the TV for shipping damage. With money on the table he unboxed it, mounted the stand, placed it on my table and then waited for me to attach my cable and power it up. He was very friendly so that helped. I thought that should have been part of the White Glove treatment without me saying anything. I was going to tip him anyway. Overall the process from ordering to delivery was painless and quick and I could not beat the price. Ignoring that part I highly recommend the Panasonic Plasma brand and this TV in particular. Setup was easy and the included wi-fi adapter was installed smoothly. One thing that did surprise me was the TV build date which was in April. It seems strange that Amazon has stock from that far back. I was hoping for one built in August or later since those TV's were supposed to have a factory firmware change to fix brightness fluctuation.

I did my homework checking the reveiws here on Amazon, the AVS forums and other sites.  Initially my first inclination was to buy to try to find last year's model because its reviews were much better.  After failing to find a new version of last year's model for a model I settle on taking a try with this TV.  Amazon's wonderful customer service and price helped make it an easier choice.I got the TV and immediately ran it through approximately 100 hours of break in using slides I found through the AVS forums.  This was something that many people had suggested.  It was tough not being able to watch it right away.  After that was completed I calibrated the TV picture using some seeting that had been recommended in the forums.  These recommended settings also turned off/minimized the feature that caused the common Floating Black issue.  I did tweak the recommended settings and the resulting picture quality is fantastic.The TV is used heavily for watching sports and playing PS3 (COD), as well as regular TV programs and some movies, both streamed and Blu-ray.  There are no issues with any of these uses.  The TV allows you to set up different settings for each input separately.  I have my sports and other TV using one setting for picture quality and the PS3 for games and Blu-ray using a different setting.  The game play on the TV is fantastic.  There is no lag due to the TV.  It is great for over the internet gaming.I don't use the internet aspect of the TV nor do I use Netflix.  I did hook it up to the network to check out its streaming capabilities but it couldn't stream most of my movies though they are AVI files.

OH NO, just like I read in a few other reviews. I called Panasonic and they explained that this was a problem with C.A.T.S., a feature that dims the set in the dark and brightens it in the light. You can disable this feature and the Panasonic rep explained that it was fixed with a software update.

She said \"I think so\" and I proceeded to attempt to configure the tv's wi fi connection to the internet.I go into the TV network settings and locate my Verizon FIOS wi fi router, enter the security key and the TV connects to the router but can't get an IP address. I try numerous times but the TV is unable to obtain an IP address from the router. So, I Google \"Viera Link and Verizon FIOS\" and learn that others have experienced this issue and it is resolved by manually entering an IP address, gateway and DNS into the TV network settings.

The posts about this problem on here did not get written til just after I made the purchase for my parents. I almost canceled the order before delivery but it was such a good price I decided to take a chance. I'm so glad I did!I don't even know how to begin describing the phenomenal picture that this tv produces. The first thing I did was a firmware update over wifi and I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. I turned off C.A.T.S. like others suggested and I have never noticed a single fluctuation with the brightness over the past month that my parents have had this tv. I do have to mention that the audio quality out of the box was not impressive but after tweaking the audio options the volume increased dramatically and I managed to improve the quality of the audio to a very acceptable level.  My own tv is hooked up to a 5.1 home theater system so I'm very spoiled with audio but my parents say that the Panasonic audio sounds great to them compared to their old 50 inch plasma so I'll leave it at that.Although there could always be more options for tweaking the picture and sound I'd say there are plenty adjustment options on this unit. My parents living room is pretty brightly lit so the Game mode seems to be the best option of viewing modes for them. There is one mode that is even brighter than Game and that is Vivid though I've been told by a Panasonic customer service rep that you shouldn't use that mode for the first couple months of use. No need to worry if you have a brightly lit room as Game mode is plenty bright enough.I love all the applications including Netflix and Pandora especially since Pandora lets you input several log in email addresses at once so you can switch between music accounts with a touch of a button.  Pick your account and bam your music is up and running right on your tv.  If I had to nit pick I'd say that sometimes (maybe once out of every 10 times) the tv gives me an error when I try to connect to the internet.  All I have to do is back out and hit the button again and it connects so this is not a huge deal.I have yet to try the 3D mode so I can't comment on that but over all the tv is fantastic. I've seen 65 inch tv's at more than double the price of this one who's picture doesn't look any better to me (in fact they often looks worse).  My parents tv is connected to Dish Network and the HD quality is the best I've ever seen on any television.

Let me say that if you are looking for a tv to place in a room without a lot of direct light on the front of the tv, plasma is the way to go as far as the best picture quality.  Black levels are deep and rich, color is beautiful, and the anti-reflective screen on this model does a great job of keeping down the glare.Sound Quality:  Again rated excellent.  For a slim cabinet and not much room to place speakers, the sound was quite impressive.  It's unreasonable to expect the same sound that you would get from a surround sound system, but a pleasant full range and depth of sound can be had from the internal speakers with plenty of volume.Viewing Angle:  Anyone looking to purchase a new tv should consider the viewing angle of the tv.  A deciding factor when I made this purchase was the fact that LCD / LED TV's suffer from a poor viewing angle when compared to plasma sets.  With the plasma, the picture can still be seen from off axis without the loss of contrast and color.Ease Of Use: The menus on this model are extremely easy to navigate and very intuitive.Style: Although it's not the greatest architectural achievement on the face of the planet, the simple styling makes this a set that will match just about any room and never look dated.The Bad:Image Retention:  This makes the whole deal a real dud.  Image retention is terrible on this tv set.  If watching a program with any type of network logo, especially if it is bright white, be prepared for image retention that will most likely end up being permanent (and not covered under warranty).  With less than 1,000 hours of viewing time on my set, a dull area began to appear in the bottom right corner of my tv.  With little thought about it, the tv was used just as my prior tube type tv was and no real concern given to the dullness in the corner.  The dullness soon began to take shape though and form into a combination of several tv network logos.  Clearly seen was a rectangle, a large H, a large D, and so on.  Before going any further, I will say that the anti-image retention settings were used along with the scrolling bar about once a week.  Once the image retention began to appear steps were taken to try to remove these artifacts.  The channel logos that were displayed were no longer viewed, or the aspect ratio was changed (an aspect ratio was always used that did not display black bars if possible).  We even let the tv sit for a period of two weeks turned off, but nothing helped with the image retention.  Before purchasing this tv I had a major concern over comments I have heard regarding \"burn in\" on plasma tv's.  After a great deal of research I still decided to purchase this model though, and much of that was based on major reviews, and the fact that Panasonic advertised on their website that burn in was a thing of the past with their plasma televisions and that no special viewing or care requirements were needed.  This simply turned out to not be true however as with further testing after discovering image retention issues, severe image retention was found to occur with as little as one hour of viewing time.If the image retention issue alone does not persuade you to look elsewhere for a tv...Web Content / Apps: Our family found the apps included to be pretty boring.  Netflix performed in a satisfactory manor, but downloaded games were dull.USB / SD Card Content:  Although there are some types of content that can be viewed directly by connecting an external device to the USB port very few formats are supported.

Earlier this year, when we first started looking in earnest, we were interested in this model because it was highly rated on numerous sites.  But then we saw people complain about a \"fluctuating brightness (FBR)\" issue under very specific scenarios and we were scared off.A few months later, we started looking around again and we noticed that despite this FBR issue, this model was consistently rated near the top of all sets in this size and price range.  When I looked into it some more (mostly by reading helpful reviews from others here on Amazon), I learned that Panasonic was able to reproduce the problem and had come up with a fix.  If you had a set which had been manufactured prior to a specific date (I think it was in Oct 2011), then you could request that Panasonic send a technician to your house at no cost to replace a single part which would fix the FBR issue; this fix was included in all new sets produced in October 2011 on.  So, to me, this was no longer an issue - if I was lucky, I would get a set with the fix added at the factory.  If I was not lucky, I would just have to schedule someone to fix it for me. It is also worth mentioning that many people with sets that have this FBR issue do not even notice it, so chances are you would not even need the fix.While reading the reviews for this set here on Amazon, I saw that some people mentioned instructions for calibrating this set to optimize the picture quality.  One or two of the reviews mentioned a web site called highdefjunkies dot com for instructions on doing this properly.  If you go to their user forums, search for the thread called \"2011 Panasonic Settings /Issues Thread\".  This thread was started by D-Nice, a guy who makes a living professionally calibrating television sets, which requires purchasing expensive calibration equipment and experience using that equipment.  According to those who eat, sleep, and breathe audio and video, it is a smart investment to pay the $400 or so to have your HDTV professionally calibrated since it will allow you to maximize the enjoyment of your HDTV for the rest of its lifetime.Most of us (including me) would not go through with this because of the expense and/or because we would assume that it would come from the factory with the proper setup.  Thankfully, D-Nice did us all a big favor.  In that thread, he outlined a very specific set of steps to follow in order to reproduce display settings which are very close to those he achieved on the same unit using his professional calibrating equipment, which intrigued me.  So, we bit the bullet and ordered the set.It is important to note that the D-Nice instructions require that you follow everything exactly or your results will differ from his.  This meant that once you turned on the set, rather than watch your favorite movie or TV show, you had to run a specific set of colored slides for 100 hours to artificially age the phosphors (supposedly, the first 100-200 hours that the plasma screen runs the pixels have the potential to subtly change colors, so these slides speed up that process and age all pixels uniformly which improves color fidelity).  There is a very helpful FAQ in post #1258 of that thread (which is located on Page 63 of that thread).  Please read this FAQ for a better idea of what to do and why it is recommended that you do this.I don't know what it would have looked like if rather than following D-Nice's instructions I had just turned it on and used it like 99% of us would have.  However, I do know that the picture is beautiful and I do not regret waiting the extra 100 hours before I could use it.We also ended up buying Walker Edison Regal 60-In. 4-in-1 TV Stand with Mount to set the HDTV on (we bought the 60\" version of this model of HDTV).  The original plan had been to use its included mount to mount the television rather than set it on the top shelf, but Panasonic's documentation was adamant that you only use Panasonic-certified mounts so I decided to set it on the top shelf instead, which was no big deal.  We also have the following equipment in this stand: middle shelf: Onkyo TX-NR509 5.1 Channel Network A/V Receiver, PlayStation 3 160GB System.  Bottom shelf: VIP 622, D-Link DGS-1008G 8-Port Gigabit Desktop Switch.  So far, all equipment is running properly since there are no ventilation issues with this stand.  The stand is also very attractive and looks great in our basement (which gets very little ambient light so we do not have any glare issues with its reflective glass screen).We also just bought Panasonic TY-EW3D3MU 3D Active Shutter Eyewear for Panasonic 3D HDTVs (Medium).  We just got them yesterday, and do not yet have much content to test them with.  I found a couple of 3D demo videos online and played them and they looked decent.  I also received Batman: Arkham City which can be played in 3D, though to be honest I did not see any real difference after enabling 3D (though I only played it another hour or two).

I updated the firmware, no change, updated the board, no change, updated the new boards firmware, no change. I'm glad others had success with them fixing the issue, but for whatever reason it didn't fix mine.A description of the problem:When switching from light scenes to dark scenes, or vice versa, the brightness will \"flick\" up or down a full second or more after the scene changes. I say \"flick\" because it's like someone is flicking a switch on the brightness. It's not gradual at all. I went through all of the settings turning off everything automatic, including the CATS and the AGC, which are auto brightness controls, but the problem would not go away. I noticed it the most on warm colored(more reds), slow moving imagery. I noticed this on all of my sources, PS3, media pc, tv channels.At first I was just going to live with it because aside from this issue the picture was amazing, but being such a nice sharp picture made me notice the problem even more and the more a tv costs the more I tend to over analyze and get a little crazy with detail. I will say this about panasonic though, their customer service seemed quite good, aside from the fact that they couldn't fix the problem. I don't know what the differences might be between my situation and others who saw the problem fixed, but I wish I was one of those lucky ones. Maybe they just stopped noticing it.Other than this one problem, I thought the tv was pretty awesome which is why I gave it 4 stars.

This is an unusual case, as I feel both ways about this TV.  I've had it in my possession for about 3 months now, and can say without a doubt that it is one of the best viewing experiences I've had.  Crisp, vibrant colors, and no noticeable delay or ghosting.However, after the first month, I noticed some burned-in images from a videogame that was played fairly frequently (~6 hours a week for the first 4 weeks, if I were to put a number to it).  I was startled by this, and discontinued use of this game on the TV, and began a rigorous process of playing fullscreen movies back to back for 5-6 hours a day for about a week.  The image retention did diminish somewhat, but did not completely fade.  I backed off of this rigorous flushing of the phosphors, but have not put anything static on the screen in the last 2 months (barring a few seconds here and there, naturally) in order to let this work itself out.  Unfortunately, the ghost of the retained image is still there in some capacity.I decided that this can't be right and called Panasonic's customer service today, only to be informed that the warranty does not cover any kind of image retention.  He mentioned that since image retention is caused by the customer 50% of the time, Panasonic corporate has decided that 100% of these issues are to be considered \"damaged by the user\", since they otherwise would have to settle with more cases to solve.  To their credit, I inspected the warranty, and in plan English, it does say \"...nor does it cover markings or retained images on the glass panel resulting from fixed images...\"  I tried reasoning with the support operator, saying that I've not even spent that much time enjoying the TV yet, and yet it looks like I will be stuck with this retained image, possibly for the duration of the system's life.  While understanding and friendly, they would not budge, nor would their manager.  My only option is to contact a recommended repair facility and pay out of pocket to have this repaired, or of course, \"deal with it\".On the one hand, the TV was relatively inexpensive (compared to LCDs in this size range), so I won't feel to badly stung if I should feel the need to replace it in a year or two.  However, I find it embarrassing for Panasonic to put so little faith in their products.  I spend a small fortune each year on tech and gadgets, and have yet to run into another big-ticket item that the manufacturer was so willing to admit is sometimes problematic without offering any recourse except paying out of pocket for repairs.Panasonic, you make a fantastic looking screen.

I would have at least tried it out, unfortunately where this TV is sitting, it's nowhere close to an ethernet cord or my wireless modem.  You can buy a wireless USB adapter to plug in the USB input so you don't have to plug in your ethernet cord.  I'm sure I'll eventually try this out and will update the results.I've read that the best time to buy new TV's is in the fall because that's when all of that years models go on sale.  Once I decided to get a new TV there was NO way I could wait that long!  I really didn't have that many specifications that I absolutely needed on a TV.  The main thing was a BIG screen, great picture, and not too complicated.  This TV met and surpassed my expectations.  I got this TV at my local Best Buy store for $1400.00.  I was down for getting ANY type of TV as long as it worked and I didn't have to service it every few years.  So that automatically took DLP TVs out of the equation since I would have to change the bulb in them fairly often.  So then it was between LED and Plasma.  ALL of the LED's I looked at (60in or bigger) were WAAAYYYY to pricey.  And the only upside of LED being that it saves more energy than Plasma, I narrowed my search to Plasma's.  Also I mainly watch sports and I've read that some 120hz LED's couldn't keep up when a fast picture went across the screen.Since Panasonic is the \"KING\" of Plasma TV's I began looking at their line of products.  Like I said earlier, I didn't need all the \"bells and whistles\" of the new 2012 line so I went for the most basic 2011 TV.  Overall, this TV is BREATH TAKING!!!  Trust me you will not regret having this in your home.  It gives you a home theater experience without leaving the house.  I noticed Amazon's price was right around $1700 when I purchased it and I looked at it today and its $2000!  Crazy!!!  If you do not want to spend this much money on a 2011 TV then look around at your local electronic stores.  I just happened to get lucky.  If you were to purchase this TV at Best Buy brand new in box it would cost you $1899.  However, when I went and looked they only had 1 left and it was the display model.  My initial thought was to stay away from it.  So I left and kept researching TVs for the next couple weeks.  I kept coming back to this model though.  I pretty much had my mind set from day one, I just had to find the best price.Personally, I have never made this big of a purchase on the internet so that kind of deterred me from buying it on Amazon.  So, I go back to Best Buy and start looking at some of the positives of the display model instead of the negatives.  All Plasma TVs say for the best \"optimal\" performace you should go through some type of process of breaking your TV in.  Every manufacturer differs on the amount of time but if I bought the display model this process was already done and I could use it right away.  Next, the price of the display was dropped to $1710 from $1899.  And last, if the TV was going to be a \"bad egg\" you would already know!  Plus it still came with the 1 year manufacture warranty if anything did go wrong down the road.  Also, you have 6 months from the date of purchase to buy an additional 2 or 3 year warranty from Panasonic.  While this seemed like a good deal I didn't want to hassle with calling Panasonic and going thru that whole process of waiting for a Panasonic tech to come out and service my TV, so I started looking into the \"Black Tie\" warranty offered thru Best Buy.  I have this on my laptop and it has come in handy NUMEROUS times.So, if by some CRAZY reason you find yourself debating on whether or not to purchase the floor model of a TV just be patient.  I got lucky by having a GREAT Best Buy employee helping me.  At first he said he could work a little bit on the price of $1710.  I told him I really only felt comfortable spending $1500.  So he asked if he could get it down to 15 would I walk out with it today.  I told him maybe not today but def in the near future.  So he went back and talked to his manager and came back with a price of $1550.  I told him that I would go home and think about it and come back tomorrow.  So, the next day I came in already planning on buying it for this price and started arranging how I was going to get it home and asking him the last questions in the buying process.  He already knew I was going to buy it and I asked if there was anyway he could get it down to $1500.  He went and talked to the manager and came back and said what price you would you walk out with it today?  I said $1500.  He goes \"how's $1400 sound\"?  I thought he was just joking but sure enough he sold me the TV for $1400.  Keep in mind he makes NO commission!!! And he already knew I was buying it!  So, at that price I went ahead and got the 2 year \"Black Tie\" warranty from Best Buy for $200 bucks just to be safe.  Even though I have NEVER had a problem with a TV going wrong but I've read SO many reviews of people having problems I wanted to have some sort of peace of mind.The moral of the story is to be patient.  Companys want to put out the best and newest products on display but if last years model is on the floor they don't have room to put it.  They will do ALMOST anything to get the old products sold and the new ones on display!  Normally I don't buy from Best Buy because they are so darn expensive.  You can get the same item here on Amazon for half the price of Best Buy.  I'm sure this is one of only a few exceptions.I know the majority of my review wasn't about the TV itself but I wanted to think that maybe I could help somebody experience the joy I did when making a big purchase.  Overall, this TV isn't the best or the most expensive but it does the job.  The picture is as good as any TV out there and it's huge!  Of course, like all flat panel TVs if you want to get as good sound as you do picture, you're gonna have to purchase a home theater system or sound bar to enhance your home theater experience.  BUT the sound is still good and will be plenty loud if you don't.  You just won't hear everything you could with external speakers.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic TC-P65ST30", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Kenny\"", "ReviewID": "RQ8MVT99Q4IIR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking at this TV and Mitsubishi 82\" since they are about the same price then I came to a local store to check them out in person. The Mitsubishi 82\" is huge but its picture quality isn't that great, so dull and dim. I guess people will sacrifice quality for size. The store only had the 65vt30 on display and I loved it at the first sight; however, the VT was around $2800. The saleman told me about the ST30 and he said after calibration, both ST30 and VT30 are not much difference. I almost ordered the 65st30 in the store but sale tax bumped the price up a little bit. I went home and bought my TV on Amazon since they price matching and I got 24 months promotion with Amazon store card.After I bought my TV on Amazon, Paul's TV had a sale at $1700 and Amazon refunded the difference right away after contacting them via my account. They added another $130 for white glove service and I'm glad they did since this TV is huge. I don't think I can carry it by myself. Amazon used Home Direct as the shipper and the agents from Home Direct were very professional. My TV arrived at a local warehouse two hours away around 5 days after shipped and the agents called me many times to update on the delivery schedule. I don't know why many buyers complained about Home Direct but I am extremely happy with them.TV looks great before I even turned it on. The agents told me that they have been delivering a lot of Panasonic plasma TV recently and my TV is the biggest so they spent more time to make sure it arrives undamage. Everything went smoothly, no cracks, no scratchs, and the TV turned on fine with no buzz. My set was manufactured in August 11 and got new firmware updated. I follow the settings from avsforum and run the 100 hours slides. The picture quality is awesome and I am a happy camper.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Large, competent, pleasing 3D-capable Plasma TV at a very good price", "Author": "conradb212", "ReviewID": "R1TS47EPIOSEOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Panasonic Viera P65T30 in December of 2011 as a replacement for a 3-1/2 year old 52-inch Toshiba LCD TV in my bedroom. I went with plasma because between plasma and LCD, plasma looks smoother and more realistic to my eye, and the darks are darker. The latter was an issue with the Toshiba LCD in my bedroom: it literally lit up the room because the dark tones were not really dark. The  2007 vintage Toshiba was also a veritable space heater, and I hoped that newer TVs would be more power-efficient.I decided on the Panasonic ST30 initially because Panasonic offered a 3D-ready 65-inch Plasma model that was reasonably priced. I initially leaned towards a less expensive 60-inch S34 model that CostCo has at a great price, but that model was not 3D ready, and reviews suggested that the ST series also uses a higher quality screen. As for pricing, what I found on Amazon was by far the best deal. Best price AND free shipping cannot be beat (CostCo wanted almost $100 just to ship). The crew even carried it upstairs and set it up.How do I like it? The 65-inch screen is gratifyingly large compared to the 52-inch I had before. Picture quality is very good, especially with 1080p Blu-Ray movies, video games and such. With standard satellite HDTV, you can at times see that the same 1920 x 1080 pixels are stretched over a much larger screen, making the picture seem softer and lacking the trademark HDTV super-sharpness (which, I suspect, will be the marketing reason for switching to 3840 x 2160 when that becomes available). Overall, the picture is excellent, though the blacks are not as pitch-black as I had expected. Sound is quite good considering there really is no room for speakers in these super-thin new flatscreens.Speaking of size and weight, the 65-inch Pana flatscreen is amazingly thin. Not waver-thin, but very thin, like two inches or so. However, it does weigh over a hundred pounds and the box is large, so don't think because you can carry a 37-inch box under your arm and pop it in the backseat of your car, you can do the same with a 65-incher. You can't.As for 3D, the P65ST30 is ready for active 3D but doesn't come with glasses. I bought two sets of XPand X103 universal 3D glasses that work great. Problem really is that there is virtually no 3D content. The couple of 3D Blu-Rays I bought are eye-poppingly gorgeous on the big Pana, and some scuba video we recorded with a GoPro 3D camera setup looks absolutely stunning on this TV (the built-in media player had no problem reading it from the unit's SDHC card reader). There's a setting to make regular TV look 3D, but while it sort of works, it's reaching and I can't see anyone put on the glasses just to see a bit of depth on regular TV.Another difference, btw, between the S30 and ST30 Series is that the latter has wireless WiFi in the form of a WiFi USB stick. I ended up not using it because it couldn't find my home network and so I just used a LAN wire instead.Smart TV is all the rage, and for that the TC-P65ST30 has Panasonic Viera Apps. There's even a Viera app store where you can download additional apps. I used the apps to watch Netflix movies, Vimeo, listen to Pandora, etc., etc. It's a handy thing to have, though the Viera interface is a bit sluggish.Overall, I am totally happy with the Panasonic TC-P65ST30 plasma TV, and Amazon certainly aced it with price and the free delivery. It's a huge step up in viewing experience and pleasure from my old 2007 LCD. Three years from now, it'll likely be obsolete as we'll have 3840 x 2160 resolution, full smart TV, and likely 3D without glasses (I can't see 3D really catching on with glasses), but for now this TV is exactly what I want and need.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic VIERA TC-P46ST30 46-Inch 1080p 600 Hz 3D Plasma HDTV", "Author": "David Kenney", "ReviewID": "R2VH45AMCYBXTN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for a few reasons: the non-3D television was not in stock, the sales guy told me that the 3D television had a faster processor and I could not find a larger plasma television in my price range. If you are new to HD, then you need to know the basics: to get a 1080p image, you need your TV signal to be broadcast in HD, you need an HD receiver, and you need HDMi cables running to and from all your components. So your initial purchase will be more than just a television. This TV is great. The picture quality is awesome and the speakers are \"decent.\" Again, if it's your first flat screen purchase, just know that you are never going to get great sound from a flat screen unless you purchase external speakers. Also note that this model of 3D television (Panasonic VIERA TC-P46ST30 46-Inch 1080p 600 Hz 3D Plasma HDTV) is \"active\" 3D - meaning it requires the more expensive, battery operated glasses. If you want to use the cheaper 3D glasses, you need to purchase a 3D TV that uses \"passive\" technology. This TV also has the VIERA options which allows you to use apps like Netflix and Skype, although I have not been able to test those features because I don't have a hard line connection to the TV and am using the wireless (and it seems slow or non-responsive on wireless). The reason I have not tested skype is because it seems this TV will only recognize a Panasonic brand camera (which I don't own). Lastly, I know all the rage is about LED, but it is so expensive. LCD is the old technology, and those TV's are heavier.

My set was manufactured 11/2011. I updated the firmware over the Internet connection without incident. TV is hunky dory; no issues.Don't use 3D, and don't plan to. I don't need to be poked in the eye to be entertained.Have the TV connected to an entertainment sound system. Can't tell you how the TV sound is, other than it has to be substandard to a multiple channel sound system. In short, money talks in optimizing the entertainment experience. But you know that; otherwise you wouldn't be ogling this TV (like I did a few weeks ago).Bought a Panasonic DMP-BDT210 Blu-ray player to accompany the TV. You want to buy a disc player made by the same manufacturer, so the remote controls, and other things, are integrated. In this case, I use the Blu-ray player remote control to control the TV, only needing the TV remote for setting adjustments and to watch Amazon streaming videos.Used an HDMI video cable to connect to the Blu-ray player, and a digital audio out cable to connect to the sound system. Because analog is old school.The TV remote is acceptable. Not stylish, but easy to read. The buttons are big enough, and well placed.Being an Amazon prime member, I was pleased to discover how much is available for free from their streaming service. The HD quality is quite good, other than the idiocy of the MPEG algorithms that compress video, particularly patches of similar hue/value. Technology is only as good as the minds behind it.This is my first 1080p HDTV, my first plasma, and my first experience with Blu-ray. Once adjusted, the TV delivers an impressive picture.

My roommate bought a 42 inch Panny 3+ years ago and it's still working perfectly to this day. However, he recently moved out and left my living room with a rather obvious void. Having enjoyed their products previously I immediately focused in on the 2011 Panny plasmas. I don't consider myself biased towards Panasonic because I have a 32 inch LG lcd and absolutely love it. However, for my plasma needs I consider Panasonic to be the best by far. The 50ST30 totally lives up to the hype. The picture is fantastic! Excellent blacks and whites, although the picture can sometimes read a little dark depending on what you're watching. I got lucky and received a Dec 2011 build, so no fluctuating brightness issues here. There was, unfortunately, a small dent in the back of the TV's vent but Amazon was very quick to issue me a fair and generous partial refund. I can honestly say that even without this discount the TV is still an incredible value. Sports, movies, and just general TV shows look excellent.

You can see the picture as clear as day from any angle on this TV.  I basically stand on the wall and look at the TV and I can still read words on the screen, that is how clear it is from just about 90 degree angle.Black level is essentially true black, when there is a black background you can barely tell the edge of the TV from the actual screen, it really pops watching sports and you see the Deep Black and bright whites, it is amazing.  You do have to change the black level in the settings from Light to Dark to really get the true effect.  I have not used the viera apps since I have an XBox and see no point to them. I also have not used the 3D since I do not want to buy glasses and very limited content.

I know there was this big thing a while ago about LCD vs Plasma.  Honestly though, I can't tell a difference.  We just got rid of our old LCD tv and personally- picture quality is every bit as good on the new plasma. This TV pretty much does everything.  We haven't got it linked to our home network yet, so I don't know how easy that will be, but so far it does everything we could possibly want.Oh and wow- we are playing Gears of War on it right now and it is out of this world- awesome!  I can't wait to see what how the PS3 games look on it. It really is just a wow-factor tv.  Not to mention the price- wow again.  If you're going to get this tv though, I definitely recommend getting channels in HD.  It is so big that the local channels can look a little funny.  But the HD channels make it look like the people are literally standing in front of you.  So all in all- great tv, would buy it again in a heart beat.  Thanks Amazon...you're the best!UPDATE*****We hooked up our wireless home network to this AWESOME tv with absolutely NO problems.  Super fast & easy.  Didn't have to buy anything additional for the wifi feature to work either.  We can now watch movies off our computers right on the TV without having to mess around with plugging the computer into the tv, or burning a movie onto a flash drive, or hooking up an external hard drive.  So I couldn't be happier.  Oh and the best part is that there is NO skipping or lagging.  I don't know how many of you have experienced this...  but on our old tv, we had to use the PS3 to play movies and the lagging was just beyond a pain in the arse :) With this tv having wifi- it reads everything perfectly with not even the tiniest of lag!", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Picture quality that blows you away.", "Author": "E. Harris", "ReviewID": "R275WT8FXZX9IH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this during labor day sale, and after viewing a full day of 1080p 2D and 3D sources.  Some PS3 games, some top blurays like Avatar (2D), and some amazing 3D like, IMAX: Under the Sea, Tangled, Tron Legacy, and so on and so on.  Even though this \"ST30\" is the least expensive and so considered Panasonics 2011 \"entry level\" Plasma.  I honestly can't see how it can get much better than this.  The colors are insanely vivid and seem to pop out of the screen, the detail is striking and the 3D quality is amazing.  Seriously amazing. I have had a 67\" DLP which I've watched many 3D movies on.  And the 3D on that is impressive.  But it has to use checkerboard which I believe doesn't work the same way current tech does.  Current tech gives a 1080p image to EACH eye, so when you watch a GOOD quality 3D game or bluray, the things that appear to come out of the screen literally look like they are floating in mid air.  Because they keep their INSANE 1080p detail even when floating toward your eye. SO THE BOTTOM LINE:- \"entry level\"?  This looks like a top of the line with amazing picture quality- 2D from good sources is insanely detailed with colors that appear to pop off the screen- 3D quality is not just \"very good\" which I've heard said about this set.  It's incredible- Pixel refresh speed is very good, I don't notice hardly any blurriness on fast moving objects.- Black levels seem very good, dark places remain dark while light areas in the same image still pop off the screen.- Bad speakers.  But you can get an awesome mid sized speaker system for $400+ that would go great with this 50\".  Look into Energy Take, or Polk Audio, or other home theaters in a box.One last thing, don't worry about fluctuating brightness, if you notice it just call Panasonic they have been taking care of everyone I hear.

I have only tried it out for a couple of hours, and I have not seen any green blobs or brightness issues as reported in these comments YET. I checked the serial number on the back of the TV, and it is not an August build, but when I connected the TV to the internet, I was prompted to download a patch / upgrade. After this is when I saw all of the Amazon.com comments on the defaults of the unit, so I called up Panasonic's customer service. The woman with whom I spoke said that that patch that I downloaded WAS the 2.0 fix for those issues, and she gave me a couple of recommendations to preserve the quality and life of the unit:- turn CAT (the light sensor) off because it is known to be quirky (if it is not off already)- in the first 100 hours, view the TV in only zoom mode (no letterbox) and in only cinema/custom viewing settings- do not leave the screen on a fixed image- she said that I shouldn't, but if I experience ANY of these problems, to call right away and they will address itI also suggest that people call Panasonic shortly after they purchase the TV to make a 'case file' with them so if you have any problems, they already have all of your information - you just give them the case number.Other than that, the picture is beautiful - crisp and clear. I prefer to watch it in cinema mode - it is not as vivid as the appropriately-named vivid mode, but it is brighter than the standard mode, which is kind of dark. However, the vivid mode is much better than its competitors. The Samsung's video mode is just atrocious - it looks surreal and can give more sensitive people headaches. Additionally, the Panasonic is only 60lbs, which makes the unit not terribly heavy, given the size over which the weight is distributed.Overall, I am very happy... Wary that something might go wrong, but definitely enough so far to not exchange it. It's so difficult to not fall in love with the picture quality. It seems at this juncture that Panasonic is aware of and taking steps to alleviate the software snafus.

The ST30 will give you the best picture quality out there for the price, and beats LCD/LED sets thousands more in price (as do most plasma sets).When you first open the box, you will have to set up the set by attaching the stand to it.  This isn't difficult but if you have a larger set, you may want to get someone to help you with the lifting.  The stand is basically two metal posts that the TV sits on top of, and then you bolt them in through the back.  I wouldn't want to take the chance of dropping my set while trying to line the posts up so they fit in the TV's slots.Once that's done, the rest is a snap to set up.  Going through the menu for initial setup takes literally seconds.  As with any plasma set, you may be inclined to use a break-in technique to age the phosphors before beginning regular viewing.  The ST30 has an SD card slot in the side, so it's very easy to run slides on it for break-in purposes.  This is the method I chose to use and I couldn't be happier with the picture.The apps work well also, mostly I only use the Netflix one.  I haven't noticed any lag.The sound is about what you would expect from TV speakers.  If you're getting this for a serious home theater, it sort of goes without saying that you will not be using the TV's speakers.  I currently am using the built-in speakers however, because I spent all my money on the TV!  Seriously though, they're fine for normal viewing and the sound quality is actually a lot better than other TV's I've had.If you've done research on the ST30, you may have stumbled upon some news about the \"fluctuating brightness\" issue on this set.  Previous Panasonics had rising blacks, and the 2011 sets have fluctuating brightness.  The issue appears to be much worse on the GT30 than the ST.  On my ST30, I have only seen it a handful of times and it's never distracting.  What the issue is is basically the TV adjusting scene brightness mid-scene.  You can see the issue when an especially dark shot transitions to a lighter one.  Sometimes the TV will initially display the bright scene, and then you will see the brightness increase or decrease ever so slightly.  I suggest taking a look at some of the in-store models to see if you can notice it.  Like I said, I have barely seen any cases of it after a month of viewing.  Others have reported that the issue is so bad on their set that they had to return it.  The last I heard, this is inherent to the driving mechanism in the TV and likely won't be able to be corrected through a firmware or other update.  The 2011 Samsungs also exhibit similar behavior.Overall, even with the fluctuating brightness issue, this is hands down the best TV you can get for under $1500.  I couldn't be happier with mine, and when it's time for another set I will likely get another Panasonic plasma.

The TV service company called me the next day and said they could come that day. The repairman already knew how to fix the TV from the description of problem. The repairman fixed my TV in about a half hour by replacing the screws securing the 2 upper video boards.

Here's a run down of how thing have gone.  Overall, I'm happy with the set and the price I paid with a few minor drawbacks that to me are annoying.1) Purchase - I got the TV from the Warehouse Deals section.  It was considered used but at almost 40% off the best retail price on Amazon ($690 v $1099) I considered it a risk worth taking.2) Delivery - I got a call the day before the expected delivery to arrange for a delivery time.  They arrived within the 2-hour schedule window, delivered the TV into the living room, unboxed it, set it up on the stand, connected the cable, and turned everything on to verify it was working.  The entire process took less than 30 minutes.  They then carted all the packing away.  Srsly a great experience.3) Picture non-3D - Looks AMAZING!  So far I have watched live non-HD TV shows, live HD and HDDVR shows, non-HD and HD Netflix, and a Blu-Ray movie.  The picture was excellent, nice blacks and colors, not blurring.  I don't watch sports or play video games so I can't comment on how well those might perform but I did watch part of a soccer game on ESPN and it was great. One drawback, this is my first HDTV and while I've watched HDTVs before this one is exceptionally clear to the point that many regular TV shows appear like they were made on videotape.  The viewing angle is pretty wide. I've played with the settings and found that the optimal one for Netflix is different than the one for live HD but I can make the change quickly now that i know what I like.4) Picture 3D - Haven't tried yet.  The TV did not come with glasses (I knew this) so am waiting to see if by end of year there are better aftermarkets specs available as the ones out now only get so-so reviews.  FYI - The new 2012 Panasonic 3D glasses are NOT compatible with 2011 or 2010 sets.5) TV set - It's a plasma so if you don't know what you are getting yourself into then stop reading and do some research.  It's not that heavy - 60 lbs - but due to the size I didn't feel comfortable trying to pick it up myself.  Room is 13x 11 and I sit about 8 feet away.  I think I would have liked the 55\" more but the 55\" started at $1300 so it's a minor trade off.  I'm happy with the results and after a month I don't even think about the size anymore.Set is solid and the design is fine, nothing fancy but not ugly either.  My living room gets lots of indirect light but even with that the glare is not major and a slight tweak of the drapes fixes any glare I do get in the morning.  The TV seems to love dust so I have to clean it off every week.  The sound is fine but I use a speaker system anyway so I can't really say much about it.  There is a bit of heat and I noticed my electric bill went up ($70 v $60 a month). I like having the TV on even when I'm not sitting down to watch so I might be above the normal usage. My set came with the wireless plug that this TV requires and it works fine.  Wireless set-up took about 5 minutes (Cisco router).6) Functions - Settings are easy to access and understand. So too is the remote.  I integrated with my Comcast universal remote in about 1 minute, most major functions can be done through that (not Viera Connect tho).7) Viera Network - Sigh.  OK, it has some decent stuff but not as much as I would like.  Also, and this is major, the Netflix interface does NOT allow you to manage your Queue.  To add/remove programs you have to access the website WHICH YOU CAN'T DO ON THE TV BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A BROWSER.  Also, the actual Netflix interface isn't as friendly as others that I have used (Playstation 3).  I haven't yet tried to connect to my laptop to stream mainly because it's not a great laptop but the set-up looks pretty easy.8) Minor quirks - When the TV turns on there is about a  10 second lag for sound via an Xfinity HD DVR.  The play control functions on the remote are at the bottom, which is not user friendly.2 addendumsA) I already planned on getting a 3D blu-ray player but now I am specifically looking for one with great WiFi integration and a browser to get wider Internet accessB) Just to be safe, I invested the $40 in an aftermarket warranty plan.  Search Amazon, set up was easy and it begins when the manufacturer warranty expires (which mine retained for some reason).UPDATE 11/27/2012 - In Sept I noticed a buzzing sound coming from the upper left backside of the set.  Turns out that even though I bought this used, because it came from the Amazon Warehouse, Panasonic considers it a \"new\" television as far as the warranty is concerned.  By the time I got my schedule worked out to have a tech come out, the buzzing stopped.  That was 6 weeks ago and the buzz has not returned.

When purchasing I was fully aware of the fluctuating brightness issue and had done extensive research around it.  However, given the price value of the tv and the reputation/quality of the panasonic plasma brand compared to other plasma tv brands I decided to purchase this model knowing full well that it could have issues.  The fact that this issue was recognized by Panasonic and they had a fix available gave me assurance that I could still buy this tv.  When I received the tv I noticed immediately from the sticker on the back of the tv that the manufacturing date was pre-August 2011 meaning that the set was made before the fluc brightness fix was installed into production.  I set up the tv and watched a few movies and never noticed any issues with the brigtness and thought I may have lucked out. Well, a few days later as I was watching Spiderman on blu ray I noticed in one of the scenes that the background brigtness shifted slightly.  I thought it might be the movie so I watched the same scene on a different tv and did not notice the shift and at that point I knew that I had the infamous brigtness issue. The issue is definitely subtle but when you know its a defect in the tv its hard to ignore and it becomes very distracting because I immediately started to notice it more often in other movies that I watched.I proceeded to call Panasonic customer service (I called the number suggested by one of the reviewers here) and they immediately sent a request for a local tv repair service to install a new board with a firmware update.  A quick bit of advice for folks who may be doing the same thing.  Make sure when the technician installs the new board that they check the board settings afterwards.  The PDP EEP settings will display a version number.  There is a specific version number that has the fix.  For example, the version my tv came with was 82.51.  Thats the bad version.  When the technician replaced the board and left.  I tested the tv and still had the fluc brightness issue.  I checked the PDP EEP version and it was 82.50.  I did some research online and found out that the proper version for the 65 inch plasma is PDP EEP = 82.53.  So even though they replaced the board the replacement board did not contain the fix!  I called the technician and they worked with Panasonic to get the right board in hand and once the board was switched a second time we checked the version and it showed PDP EEP = 82.53.  I tested the tv and the problem was fixed and since then I've been 100% happy with my tv.  For those that want more detail on this issue and the fix (including how to check your PDP EEP version) go to the highdefjunkies forum and look up panasonic fluctuating brightness problem.  There is a TON of valuable information there.All in all this was a great purchase and an outstanding tv.  I couldnt give it 5 stars because as a customer I shouldnt have to buy a tv that has to be serviced afterwards.  I still gave it 4 stars because I give panasonic credit for recognizing the issue and stepping up to provide a fix at no cost to the customer.  Panasonic could have denied any issues and could have assumed that the average consumer may not notice the \"minor\" problem or can live with it.  Thankfully, Panasonic must know that a lot of videophiles hold the brand in high regard and those same folks expect nothing but the best and the company's response to this issue is a testament of their commitment to a high quality product.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV, Horrid customer service from Panasonic", "Author": "Dan134 \"dan134\"", "ReviewID": "R31Y4GDPV2SERH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is an amazing TV.  Rich, deep blacks, vibrant colors, simple but elegant design.  However it has a flaw - fluctuating brightness.  It will almost look like parts of the TV are flickering.  This isn't an issue that only the hardcore tech junkies will notice - it's a very widespread problem.  Panasonic did actually fix this issue but if you happen to purchase, say, a model manufactured in April of 2011, you will need to call up Panasonic customer service to resolve this issue.Unfortunately Panasonic customer service is atrocious.  The first guy I called had no idea what I was talking about (and yes, I used the number posted in one of the reviews here) and it took forever.  He referred me to a repair shop, which I called immediately.  I bought this TV a few days ago, so it obviously falls under warranty.  When I called the repair shop, they informed me it would be 100 dollars out of pocket to send a tech out to fix.  This is unacceptable.I called Panasonic again and the next guy I spoke with was a total jerk.  When I voiced my concern, he assured me there was absolutely nothing Panasonic could or would do to assist me and resolve this issue.  After arguing with him for 10 minutes, I asked politely to speak with a manager.  I assured him I would not complain about him and that I just wanted to get my TV fixed.  He then proceeded to tell me that there was no way he could connect me to a manager and hung up on me.I immediately called back and was connected with a woman this time.  She was incredibly polite, knew of the issue and put me on hold for about 20 minutes before informing me she would send me a firmware update in the mail.  Why was this so hard?  Why can't Panasonic just inform their techs to do this for all cases regarding the ST30, rather than having a ridiculous back and forth which wastes both my time and the Panasonic technician's time?The firmware update will be here within a couple of weeks, and if it works properly and I don't have to deal with Panasonic again, I will update this to 4.5 stars, with the only complaint being customer service.If you are thinking of buying this TV, it's an AMAZING set (the best I've ever seen in person).

Basic setup quite a breeze. Amazon's in-home delivery truly outstanding. Sound struggling to keep up even at moderate volumes. Very basic remote.This is our second flat-panel television. The first one - also a plasma display - is a Pioneer Kuro and it is still outstanding and a league apart. In fact, many of my comments below will use the Pioneer Kuro as the reference. Since Pioneer discontinued its consumer-oriented plasma panels several years ago, Panasonic has successfully picked up the mantle and stepped up to the challenge as an able successor. These days, despite the advances in LCD and LED-lit LCD technologies, it is still quite hard to beat the picture quality of a plasma at a comparable price point using an LCD or an LED-lit LCD.This model - in the Panasonic ST30 series - is no exception. There are some gripes, e.g., sound quality and remote functionality could be better. The sound, in particular, is borderline awful. Even with sound effects for better low-end turned on, the small speakers are demonstrably no match for even the regular television programming sound. The user should channel the sound through a home theatre system to properly enjoy content. The remote is really bare-bones. The television being a smart TV, the remote could definitely benefit from a QWERTY keypad. Typing letters via the on-screen menu can be a pain.But, as long as the user knows how to calibrate the display properly, the overall picture quality actually comes very close to the Pioneer Kuro. The main caveat in the last sentence is about knowing how to calibrate. The television has quite a few calibration parameters that the user can tweak. A pro can make the most sense out of it, but I wish there were some on-screen explanation, if not an actual before-and-after side-by-side display of how the picture would change when the user would modify one or more of those settings. This I found to be a very useful feature on the Pioneer Kuro.So, off to the pros. CNet is a great resource. Google or search for calibration parameters and chances are that the average user will be able to locate a set of calibration settings that may actually work very well on the display. I did that and the effect was awesome. As I noted, the picture quality is now very close to Pioneer Kuro.Which brings me to the other point of default factory settings. One good thing about the Pioneer Kuro - not the Elite Pro model - is that even though it does not come with all those tweaks, the default settings are actually quite excellent. That mostly mitigates the hassle of doing this trial-and-error thing with the multitude of calibration parameters. I wish Panasonic did the calibration themselves - hey if CNet can do it so can Panasonic I suppose - and used those as the default factory settings.Regarding the picture I have only two issues, both of which are more than eliminated by way of proper calibration and settings. But, issues they are nonetheless. First one is with the 48 Hz (extrapolated) frame refresh rate. This is an eyesore and actually can give you a headache as it does not seem to work the way it sounds to be. When engaged, this mode causes excessive jitter, as I noticed on television broadcasts showing 2:3 pulled up 1080p/24 material such as movies. In fact it looks like the actual frame rate is far below even 24 fps, although closer inspection reveals that it is not the case. The issue appears to be more related to high-rate brighness fluctuation than a low frame-rate of display, but I could be wrong. All in all, 48 Hz makes the television pretty much unwatchable. The good and redeeming thing is that regular 3:2 pulldown, e.g., with movies broadcast on television, works flawlessly. The latter is, by the way, what the calibration settings that I used recommend, so this is no longer an issue for me. In comparison, Pioneer Kuro's \"Advance\" mode, which , I think engages a 72 Hz extrapolated refresh rate, does a wonderful job in my opinion (even though I am sure many picture purists may actually find that statement appalling).The second issue is with the setting for panel brightness. I noticed that there are decidely some shadow detail, colour saturation and colour balance lost when going down from high to mid to low brightness settings. High setting, along with the other calibration parameters that I used gave me the most accurate colours with adequate shadow details, even though mid setting was not all that bad.In all other respects, including reproduction of HD material - 480p through 1080p, the set does wonderfully. Upconversion to the native 1080p is excellent, even for good old 480i material from analogue channels and sources. The set also comes with a USB-tethered dongle that can connect the television to the home WiFi network. Setting this up was quite easy - plug and play - except for the pain to type in the WEP password to access our home WiFi using the basic remote. I have noticed only one instance where the television seemed to require reestablishment of the WiFi link, i.e., by going through the setup menu, but that could be a temporary issue with our home WiFi router. Streaming movies from Netflix at HD quality was without any buffering or interruption, and pretty much flawless, except for one minor point: the colour setting appears to require a higher setting when streaming movies from Netflix than, say, when watching regular television or a DVD/Blu-ray disk.I am still waiting for my 3D glasses to be delivered, so have not yet had a chance to inspect the 3D qualities of this set.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, FBR Still An Issue", "Author": "J.

The Panny handles motion very well...but make sure you turn off the motion smoother. You don't need it.Good build quality-I returned an LG LED for the Panny and the LG felt really cheap. The Panny feels more solid.Good GUI-the UI for the menus is one of the better I have seenCons:Buzzing!!-I ended up returning my first set because of a couple of issues AND the buzzing. Turns out they all buzz...just to varying degrees. Even the floor models at Walmart and Best Buy were buzzing. My buzzing is more of a directional-related issue. If I'm just off center the buzzing lessens considerably.Horizontal Line-Both this set and the one I returned had a faint horizontal line running across the middle of the screen. I decided to live with it which, in all honesty, is so subtle you'd have to hunt to find it.Screen Uniformity-Again, not something most people would notice but I look for things like this. My screen is a little bit cloudy and you can see this during pans of skies especially...nothing horrible but it's there.If you're considering this TV be aware of the fluctuating brightness issue (just google it). Supposedly sets with the serial number \"1215\" and up have the issue fixed but I was surprised to find out mine, which had a serial number \"1206\" had also been fixed as well.A word of warning...leaving the TV in \"standard\" mode will lead you to believe you have the fluctuation issue which is false. Mine was exhibiting some of the fluctuation issues as well as having a noisy/snowy image. I almost considered returning this set as well until I started messing around with the picture settings. Any other mode will eliminate the above issues. Standard mode is there merely to satisfy government energy regulations so you sacrifice picture quality to save energy...not really worth the few kilowatt hours saved.Overall I'm extremely pleased with this TV.

The picture is absolutely perfect now.And lastly, the wireless WIFI connection was a bit difficult to get to work when trying to connect to my Verizon Fios Actiontec modem. It simply would not work until I manually entered the IP address, Subnet, etc. into the TV's network settings. As a tech savvy person I was able to solve this fairly easily. If you have this problem, you can find the solution on google by searching: \"does panasonic viera cast work with fios\"In summary, while my \"cons\" description was lengthy, I found the issues to be minor because the TV is working flawlessly now that I have the a fore mentioned issues resolved. In the absence of those issues, this would be a 5 star TV, especially given that it's price is at $899.00 (3D glasses not included).", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the TV - wonder if the aging process helped", "Author": "George Sopp", "ReviewID": "R3H3ELX40KE33V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture is truly beautiful.

I'm reasonably happy with this TV but not jumping with joy.Just a little context: this is our 2nd plasma.  The first was an HP 42\" set manufactured by Panasonic.  I have no complaints about that one at all, it worked pretty much perfectly.A few months ago we decided we'd like to go a little larger and 1080p, and based on experience with the other set I pretty much limited my searching to Panasonic.  I quickly found the TC-P50ST30 here on Amazon, the price was good and the reviews were wonderful.  So we bought it.The first thing we noticed upon installation was the sound - it's lousy.  About a 3 on a 1-10 scale of all TVs I've ever heard (just counting internal speakers here) and the other Panny was a 10.  Literally the next day we ordered a cheap surround receiver so we could hook up real speakers.  That solved that problem.But my other 2 complaints about this set persist.  First is brightness fluctuations.  I've read a lot about those in the comments here and I don't think my problem is the same as others have reported.  My issue is whenever a bright scene comes up, the picture slowly grows dimmer over about 10 seconds.  Likewise, when the scene switches from bright to dark, the picture grows slowly lighter over a similar period.  It's like it's trying to make all scenes the same brightness.  I should mention this is with an HDMI connection from a FIOS box and it's possible it's the FIOS box and not the TV.  But we've got the old TV up in the bedroom connected to another FIOS box and it doesn't have the problem.  I should mention I've got all the various \"automatic\" features (like room lighting compensation and color correction) turned off.The other problem though I do think is definitely the set.  The picture flickers!  It's exactly the same as what's called the \"rainbow effect\" with DLP projectors - you see multicolored fringes around bright areas of the picture.  You can kind of learn to ignore it, but the old plasma did NOT do this at all.Other than the above, we're pretty happy with the set.  Color rendition is good, the larger screen and higher resolution are great.  3D we haven't tried yet but I'm sure eventually we'll give in to temptation!

My 50\" DLP seemed a little small for my living room which is why I chose a 60\" set.  I just received this set yesterday, but here is an early review.First all, I was very impressed with Amazon delivery.  The local company in Nashville brought the set to my living room (within the scheduled time window), unboxed it, installed the stand to the TV, put the TV on my entertainment center, and powered it up.  They aren't allowed to hook up anything else, but I could do the rest easily.  This service and delivery can be $70 from someplace like Sears, HH Gregg, or Best Buy, so it definitely is added value for Amazon.After making some video adjustments based on online forums, I am really impressed with the clarity and quality of the TV.  I use Uverse HD and an older Blu-ray player, and the picture is terrific from both sources.  It really is a big improvement from DLP and my older rear projection set.  I am amazed at how you can see a clear picture from any angle (even all the way to the side), something that most technologies just don't have.  The picture really wins this set over.While I have the TV hooked up to the internet, I don't have a lot of use for the apps.  You can add apps to the set, but you have to sign up with a credit card, even if the apps are free.  Youtube is nice, but if I ever get Netflix again, I would rather use my bluray player for it.I can't say anything about 3D yet.  No glasses comes with it, and I don't even have a 3D bluray player.  I am glad it has that functionality, but I will likely wait for some good deal on glasses and a player before committing to that technology.I use and older Sony soundbar (CT100) with the system, which works pretty well.  So I don't use the built-in sound.  The only issue is that I have to stand up or raise the remote really high to turn on the TV, since the bar blocks the IR port when sitting down.

I am changing my review to 5 stars from 3 stars to update what has transpired since the purchase.Even with standard definition cable the image is good. Not like HD or blu-ray, but a nice image. The problem I encountered from changing from my older panasonic viera to this one was since it is HD, it noticed the lower signal strength of the cable coming into the house that the 480p screen did not really pick up.I'm still not sure why a standard DVD player shows such a bad signal, but the Oppo 93 I just purchased was great.I hooked up a new Oppo 93, and I have to say the picture is amazing! So rating has been changed to reflect this. Others that have the same problem, check your cable signal strength as a possible source. This screen will pick up any problem.I guess the one thing I will say is the option that the tv has to solve this problem did not work for me, so maybe the signal strength was to bad for the tv to solve internally in custom mode.After reading some poor reviews about Panasonic CS on other products I thought I would update my review with how I was treated. As for my customer service support from Panasonic I was pleasantly suprised. I filed my ticket online and within 4 days I had a response asking intial questions. When I was able to reply, it only took another couple of days to get a reply then a couple more tech out to the house. Yes it wasn't super fast, but it solved my concern. Many peaople have bad opinions about Panasonic support, but I for one was happy with what I got. Yes it wasn't an immediate answer, but it did solve my concern and in the end that's what I needed. In times where we expect things done yesturday, I for one don't mind waiting a bit as long as I'm heard. And Panasonic listened to me.Old Review -  can be disregarded. Just left to show change from 3 start to 5 star.I purchased my 60 inch ST30 for a steal of a deal after I promised myself I would wait for a while to see how these new models were performing.No green blob, no fluctuating brighness, none of the other concerns that people have been observing and reporting. I felt really lucky. I performed the panel prep as some sites recommend and used the calibration settings specified for custom mode.My set is hooked up to a HD cable box, standard DVD player and a Denon AVR 891 receiver by HDMI cables, and component for the DVD.When watching cable and movies, the outlines of objects (stationary and slow moving) have a very pixelated look to them that have a variety of colours and make the image look out of focus... Almost like the outline is flickering. So unlike a lot of reviewers I can't be happy with the PQ even when Im not being picky about a product I spent so much money on at a good price... It is not the problem some sets have for flickering with fast moving objects as my son and I were watching Barney and he was standing still at the time!My other complaint is the hours that Panasonic Concierge service has in Canada for customer support. It is only 9 to 4:30 EST, monday - Thurs so if I'm on the west coast, as I am, I would have to leave work at 1:30 just to call when the office closes!!!! To me that is not customer support as most people watch their tvs in the evening, and can't take time off work to deal with a problem during the day!!!!!

Moses \"CJMLB\"", "ReviewID": "R1BLBOKV6EPMMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This set just rocks.  It was between this and a Samsung LED on sale with an instant mfr rebate at my local Costco.  The LED had super sharp picture quality.....unfortunately it also had a very distracting tendency towards jagged artifacts during fast motion scenes.  It was much better than early LCDs, but visible anomolies attributed to the motion smoothing technology were rampant.  Until that and the limited viewing angle issue are perceptibly addressed in LCD/LED panels, my money goes to plasma technology, particularly as an avid gamer.Pros:Awesome picture quality (nothing matters more in my book).  Going from a 42\" 720p Panasonic plasma to this model, the 'softness' of DVD content is quite apparent from two separate high quality upscaling players.  Blu-ray is a must at this screen size, and the quality is such that watching outdoor scenes from a stationary camera that suddenly sets into motion is slightly disorienting.  The effect is akin to looking out an open window and the scenery begins to move as if the house is on wheels.  I spent the first few days viewing various content using the cinema picture setting after reading several articles designating this as the closest to THX.  I later found a site with specific consumer calibration settings for this model and the difference this adjustment made is remarkable.  I've replaced the factory default with these settings for all inputs and now the color, color temp, saturation, contrast, etc., are spot on.  Cinema is not bad, but it definetely mutes the color pallete too strongly for my liking.Nice connected functionality and application suite.  Netflix streams nicely and the picture is good for their HD content and subpar for non-HD.  That's not the tv's fault...their SD content looks like crap on smaller screens too.  The apps are arranged nicely and they perform well.  The connected content is not a big factor for me, but the app selection introduces a few offerings, Amazon and CinemaNow, that are not available on my other streaming devices.  HuluPlus is notably missing, if that matters to you.  Getting connected was easy, that is, easy after I gave up trying to enter my wireless network passkey (which was rejected) and instead connected via the WPS function.  Hopefully your router has this feature because it made the process a breeze.Cons:Pedestrian styling.  This set is considerably thinner than earler generation plasmas, but the styling is squarely ho-hum.  The bevel is relatively thick and while there's not much to complain about, there also little that improves upon the aesthetic of its predecessors.  The set is also fairly non-descript so it is not likely to be an offensive addition to your living room, and there's nothing to detract your eyes from the excellent picture when powered up.  The base pedestal is a high gloss piano black finish that does a great job of showing off how rarely dusting happens around my place.The not so subtle brightness shift occurring between light and dark scene transitions described in other reviews here is a fact of this model.  While it is noticable, it becomes markedly less so, provided you make some picture adjustments that should be made even in the absence of this flaw.  It's definitely not a dealer breaker for this reviewer, and there are far more egregious imperfections in today's competing flat panel technologies.Overall, you'd be hard pressed to find a model of this quality and performance out there, especially at this price point.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "On Going Review", "Author": "Jeffrey Peck", "ReviewID": "R3PA1HGIIUEFUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just received TV tonight, 23 May 2011The picture is fine, though I am not an expert in such things.Setup experience:1) Only issue was getting Lan card (not via wireless dongle) to acquire an IP from DNS.Even though it, in fact did acquired an IP, the TV reported it could not.I verified the MAC address in my router, and yes, it had acquired IP.I repeatedly tried manual and automated methods - no luck - check reported failure.Finally I fully powered off TV and restarted - then upon restart the IP was acquired and the check/test passed.LESSON HERE: fully restart at least once before attempting to acquire IP's via DNSViera Widgets:1) Would have preferred seeing the Al Jezeera, BBC, etc..2) Many of the widget are mostly text info3) The big hitters of course, are there: Netflix, etc..2) Even to add the free widgets one must to go through a tedious login/account setup process.Tedious because one must use the remote to key in all the numbers and letters.Blue tooth keyboard option would have been nice.Ongoing:I'll add more later if something interesting happens.# UPDATE 6/19/2011For first month of use I used the internet tools often.I continued to notice issues with the TV losing it's IP address after exiting the internet widgets.I would then attempt to acquire another and it would fail.I then turned of the TV and then unplugged it.

My unit has not had any issues with blobs, pixel breakup, or any other issues. The blacks are absolutely black, which creates excellent contrast. I haven't customized the picture (yet); I just run it on vivid and normal temp. It is in a south facing room; no issues with glare. No discernible buzzing heard. Basically works as advertised!Set up was very easy; took about 3 minutes to get through the initial menu; I delayed the internet connection (a dongle is included)at first but later installed that with no problem. (it helps to read the manual online prior to delivery!) I currently have it on the included stand. It was delivered (from Amazon) via CEVA; they notified me 2 days prior to the scheduled delivery and actually delivered it a day early. There was only one delivery guy; he offered to get another helper but it would have been later in the day, so I helped him bring it in. He opened it; he helped me attach the stand and lift it to TV stand (not so much heavy as it is kinda big to handle), and waited until I got it hooked up and turned it on. I hadn't ordered anything this big from Amazon before; but I will do so in the future!Regular HDTV cable is great; bluray DVDs are absolutely fantastic. I haven't really noted any motion blur. I don't use the TV's sound as I pipe it through the home theater set up all the time. The internet connections work flawlessly, although I have only used Netflix and YouTube so far. I got a couple of the short 3D DVDs; other than the DVDs being pretty lame (no great movies yet) the 3D works very well. I get a little breakup on 3D; but I have since read the DVDs I bought are problematic for that, although I think I will hang the unit on the wall to get it a little higher for a better feed for the glasses synch. I had to play with it a little bit to get the 3D, but turned out my issues was with my Sony bluray player (this is my 1st 3D)I was a little concerned that I hadn't actually seen the TV before buying it, as it wasn't in stores yet, but I had been looking at last year's Vieras, so I thought it would be OK. It is - and I am very glad I purchased it - no regrets whatsoever.I highly recommend this TV!", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thick Black Line!", "Author": "Joseph L. Mariani", "ReviewID": "R2QFT1EGRL0R0T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great features. Deep, rich blacks and shadow detail. Tons of settings to get exactly what you want. BUT.....on the third week anniversary of my installation, a thick black line appeared horizontally along the left side of the screen, about 2 inches in. My call to Panasonic went quickly and cordially, and a local servicer will be here on Monday. I will update this review after that visit. This is an excellent product, and I hope to bring several more stars to my review. Let me emphasize that this is not burn-in. It has come and gone a couple of times, and it appears/disappears based on the darkness of the scene; it dissipates almost completely when a bright image appears at the affected location. I asked the person who opened my case if she had heard of this, and she said yes, but only once and with a different model. Hopefully it's just a defective board that can be replaced quickly on site. Disappointing, but I'm a reasonable consumer and I realize that defects occur. If it's resolved quickly, I would think that would be a positive for the product and the company standing behind it.UPDATE: Panasonic failed to advised the local service company of the appointment. However, the service company managed to get here 24 hours later. The tech was knowledgeable, courteous and efficient. Here's what the problem turned out to be: As all readers of these reviews know, builds of this model before 8/2011 needed a board replaced to solve a fluctuating brightness problem. My unit was produced 5/2011 and suffered from no such problem; I assume the board had been retrofitted. This seemed to be the case. Apparently, there are 7 ribbon connections across the bottom of the interior that feed the video signal to a seventh of the light panel. Each has some 1700 connections. One little pin connector became loose or dirty; the leftmost one that controls the video feed to the extreme left of the screen. The tech cleaned and reconnected it, and VOILA, goodbye black line!! I should add that whoever did the retrofit of the A board was pretty lazy, as only 4 screws holding the back panel were replaced.....out of some 28. The remaining screws were placed in a little baggie and taped inside the unit....shoddy, indeed!! Following the reconnect, the tech showed me a tiny light image retention near the upper left corner that I probably wouldn't have noticed myself. He had me run the anti image retention \"wash\" for about ten minutes, and told me that if it didn't go away, to call him and he'd oreder a new light panel. Following his directions, I couldn't see any image retention even with a magnifying glass. I picked his brains about build quality, and he said that Panasonic was well respected.Since the repair, I've noticed that the picture is brighter and the color more vivid (probably because I'm now through the breakin period). I've paired the Panasonic with my new SONY 7.1 receiver, and the sound quality is startingly good; the Panasonic just senses HDMI and functions perfectly in synch. Switch inputs from cable to PS3, and the cable box goes off and the PS3 powers up. Increase volume using the TV remote, and it senses the HDMI connected to the receiver and indicates that it's increasing receiver volume rather than the TV speakers (even without setting the TV speakers to 'off').I rate the 65ST30 as follows:Picture quality: 4.5 stars (fabulous blacks and shadow detail; very realistic 3d)Setup: 5 stars (Thanks the Good Lord for HDMI); tons of settings, but online descriptions of what each does).Build quality: 3.0 (the inside is well organized, and there's plenty of metal where there could be plastic; but someone has to suffer for that shoddy board replacement).Features: 4.0 Should have a better browser at this price point, but all the apps are there as are every setting I'll ever need. A 4th HDMI input wouldn't hurt, though.Value: Trust me, Home Theater was correct in placing the ST30 series at the top of the heap....and I didn't just rely on their reviews (i bought before the review came out). Like I'm sure everyone who buys at 55\" and over did, I researched the hell out of this. There simply is no better value at the 65\" point.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Too many reviews totally unbalanced", "Author": "C. Miner", "ReviewID": "R3OC1Y94KFGLW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This panel, TV, telly, this thing rocks. Its fantastic. For the 10 foot experience, I went from a CRT to this, and this panel put me in love with HD. Of course, I've spent most of my time viewing things in front of a 22\" Samsung LCD computer panel. I've watched most movies, TV shows, and all my gaming on the computer. From now on, my computer is only good for the internet and gaming (slow response time makes gaming always feel slightly 'off'). All my movies, TV and most of youtube stuff will be on the ST30. I've got a Roku XD, Panasonic Blu-Ray player and cable hooked up to the panel.I followed D-nice's suggestions on breaking in the TV and using his calibration settings. It produces a fantastic picture.[...]I am absolutely exuberant about my new TV. That's why I am so annoyed at many of the reviews on Amazon. I don't see any green blobs other's have seen, and my panel was one of the earlier production runs based on its serial number. The sound is perfectly passable, but anyone expecting high-quality sound from a 50-in panel for less than a grand just doesn't know what they're doing. The built-in sound on any big screen panel only exists so that it functions until you buy an audio system, ideally surround-sound. And if you don't want surround-sound, the built-in audio is fine.My TV does have the problem of the brightness shift JIMMIENOMAN noticed, but after updating the firmware, the shift is hard to notice, and only happens once in a long while. Also, it is wrong to claim they are brightness \"fluctuations,\" since that sounds like several brightness changes in a row. It is only a shift, since the brightness changes noticeably once at a time. I might still call Panasonic to come fix the issue, but it's barely worth my time as the brightness shift if barely ever noticeable, and when it is noticeable, it hardly distracts from the viewing material. None of these issues qualifies 1-star reviews. At most, I think it would warrant one or two star deductions, but giving this panel 1/5 stars is just ridiculous. You can't expect $5,000 of quality when you've paid barely more than 900.All this said, I'm thoroughly happy with my panel and do not regret it, even after learning more about other plasmas since the purchase of the ST30 (particularly this year's LG models, which sound great but are more expensive).", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sharp screen but migraine inducing horizontal refresh glare, cheap speakers", "Author": "G. Baldwin", "ReviewID": "R1AYJQXQRO4O4H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased a Panasonic TC-P46ST30 as an upgrade from an older Panasonic TH-42PZ80U plasma unit.  I also own a Panasonic TH-42PX80U plasma unit.  I owned my TC-P46ST30 for less than one week before returning it.Improvements with the TC-P46ST30 over my older Pani plasmas include improved sharpness, an upgraded remote, a swiveling stand, stronger over-the-air digital tuner and a better settings menu.  Color consistency was better, without any sort of washed out look during very bright scenes.  Ghosting of bright objects moving over dark backgrounds was less noticeable.  The overscan and zoom settings are unchanged from the TH-42PZ80U, as was the speed when changing digital channels.  If there were any fans in the TC-P46ST30, they were silent.  The anti-reflective coating was just as good at keeping reflections down.The TC-P46ST30 also includes a new interpolation mode that converts 24/30 fps content to 48/60 fps, 2:3 telecine pulldown, USB inputs, a dual-band 802.11n WiFi USB dongle and interactive media apps.  I found that the interpolation mode would break during scene changes often enough that I eventually disabled it.  The WiFi dongle had no problems connecting to my 802.11g WPA2 AES+TKIP network and never dropped, even with a nearby microwave oven running.  The menu for the media apps was sluggish and many of the apps required subscriptions (the Hulu app refused to work without a Hulu Plus account).  The integrated media player could only access DLNA+UPnP network shares and not SMB shares, but did handle most of the media files I threw at it.Shortcomings with the TC-P46ST30 over my older Pani plasmas include fewer AV inputs (drops one component YPbPr input, one composite input and drops S-Video completely) and outputs (drops analog RCA audio out).  The integrated speakers are noticeably worse, with dialog being harder to understand and mid-range sounds being thin.  The brightness of the picture would sometimes change suddenly (see below) and the screen suffered from horrible glare (see below) that was so bad that the television was almost unwatchable for me.Digital SPDIF audio out is still limited to optical only - there is no coax SPDIF output.  The integrated tuner is still limited to a single coax input, so you can't mix OTA antenna with QAM cable or have two OTA antennas pointing to different cities.  The zoom choices for 4:3 channels still doesn't include a 14:9 letterbox zoom mode.I encountered the unsteady brightness issue that other reviewers have mentioned, but it seemed fairly mild.  I assume I had a unit that was shipped with a fixed firmware (which was further updated after I configured the WiFi).  I only noticed it a few times, and only because I was looking for it.  It mainly occurred with darker scenes.  It wasn't bad enough that I wouldn't recommend this plasma because of it.My biggest complaint is that the TC-P46ST30 uses very fast phosphors with only a 60Hz horizontal refresh rate.  While the fast phosphors help prevent ghosting, they come at the expense of very harsh flickering/glare.  I was getting mild headaches after 20 minutes and severe headaches after an hour.  My wife was bothered by it as well, although not as much as I was.  To me, it was bad enough that I'd recommend buyers spend a few minutes in front of an in-store demo to see if it bothers you (and is why I give this product two stars rather than four stars).  It was the sole reason I returned my unit.Final notes: I really, really wish they would have doubled the horizontal refresh rate to 120Hz with these new phosphors (like how some European PAL televisions double their refresh rate from 50Hz to 100Hz to eliminate flicker/glare).  I also would have liked one S-Video input (even if shared with the composite input), an extra antenna/cable input, better speakers and a non-optical audio output.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pink and Green Tints Spoil 60\" ST30 - Again...", "Author": "RDK", "ReviewID": "RDREUJJ3F5VH1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We recently Exchanged one 60\" Pan ST30 for a second unit - replacement arrived Jan 24, 2012.The first was returned for Green Blobs (which diminished over time, but did not disappear) and a Pink Tint - which started at the very edges of the screen, but spread considerably as the panel was used.Amazon has been wonderful throughout this process - although they are presumably still waiting for the original unit to be returned by the shipper - and even the shipper (CEVA) made a pretty good approximation of \"White Glove\" delivery (for both sets).Alas, the second ST30 ALSO suffers from the Green AND Pink flaws:Green seems to be spread over a larger area than with the first set, although it is NOT as bright. Very possible this could fade over time.The PINK Tint, however, occupies nearly every portion of the screen that is NOT relegated to the Green: if the Pink shows the same Expansion on this second set as it did on the first, we will soon think that we are Literally viewing the (TV) world through Pink Sunglasses!Very Disappointing, to say the least.FWIW, first set carried a July build date, while the second is tagged with October - so whatever problems Panasonic had with the Quality Control on 2011 sets apparently never got resolved.We have two other Panasonic Plasmas in the house, and thus it is reasonably easy to determine that the discolorations are NOT a part of the broadcast, but rather are, indeed, peculiar to the two ST models we have had.Will keep this new set for a couple of more days, in the hopes that the Pink will \"magically\" self-correct, but expectation at this time is that we will be sending a second unit back to Amazon.

It only has optical audio out, supports the Dolby, recommend to use a home theater deck to get some volume out of it. Recommend to turn on the AI and Surround Sound too. If you need to convert the Optical out, be sure to buy a unit that can convert 5.1 Dolby because all HD channels are outputted this way from the TV and won't convert to just Stereo LR RCA converters.The Viera Connect, formerly Viera Cast, is really pointless.

I went to cnet.com where since it was close to the holidays (2011), they had a list of the top 10 flat screen tv's for under $1000.  I then went to amazon and ranked the flat screens by customer review.  This tv was the only one to be in the top 10 on both sites.  After reading the reviews, I was very hesitant due to some people saying I needed to age the phosphors, some people talking about black lines, some people talking about some fix that was made later in the year, but you couldn't be sure which one you would get until it came, etc. etc.  You can read them - they're all on here.  To be on the safe side, we ran full screen movies for 100 hours even though many reviews said the new plasmas do not need this done.  I didn't want to take a chance on such a big purchase.  It is now 11 months later & the tv performs wonderfully.  Colors are just as crisp & clear as the day it came out of the box.  None of our kids are gamers, so the tv is just used for television and movies.  We haven't tried the 3D aspect yet so I'm not sure how that is.  We use the wifi streaming movies & tv shows all the time & love that capability.  The only issue we had was when we ordered, the holiday special at the time was free white glove expedited delivery.  I believe we ordered in mid-Dec. and the tv did not arrive until after christmas.  We would check the tracking every day.  It was shipped immediately after purchase & then sat in a warehouse 90 minutes from our house for weeks.  We finally called amazon who gave us the number of the shipper & gave them a call.  The tv was eventually delivered much later than anticipated.  So - now that the holidays are here again, we decided to add our 2 cents to the review of this television.

Let me just share that this was to replace my LG Plasma that I purchased in Spain in 2006 that has gone through 4 moves (including one international move) and has NEVER had a problem and that we gave to my mother in-law as it STILL works fine.  Also let me share that I'm not the type that regularly leaves product reviews but I thought this warranted a post.So I would rate this TV 5 stars as everything was working great until yesterday (3 months after the purchase) and the TV just died!  No picture whatsoever after a faint pop occurred.  Yep something blew but here is the kicker, don't have your TV break on a Friday as Panasonic warranty services will help you make an appointment for the following Friday but wait, your service center is open tomorrow (Saturday) and they will help you.  So I call Advisory TV on Saturday and they do say to dial ext. 203 for Saturday service and after 9 minutes ringing and nobody picking up or any voicemail you are pretty much stuck until Monday.  Thanks Advisory TV for allowing me to leave a message (yes, that was sarcastic).  So here we are without our only TV in the house (yes we are a bit old fashioned but we don't believe in having TV's in the bedrooms).I give this TV the smallest rating possible based on poor workmanship from Panasonic as well as their warranty service.  TV's do break on the weekends!

The FPT5884 was great but the P65ST30 smokes it in every regard and cost less than half of what I paid for the Samsung just 4 years ago.  While I'm sure that the GT and VT models have their advantages, I am completely satisfied with what the ST model offers.  In my living room the ST model looks spectacular after playing with the display settings for about 15 minutes.  Initial setup was a breeze including setting up the WIFI adapter that comes with the TV for online content (Netflix, Hulu, Skype).  I purchased this TV on March 24th and the model I received had a build date of November 2011 which means it was preloaded with the latest patches for issues mentioned on most of the negative reviews.  I think the most impressive feature of the P65ST30 is the superior black level, video content with black bars on top and bottom blend seamlessly into the black frame of the TV.  Unfortunately the 3D glasses are not included so I have not been able to evaluate the TV's 3D performance but at Amazon's price this TV would be a steal even if it were not capable of 3D.

That said, the picture quality is nice and clear, though coming off of my experience with a 50\" Bravia it seems like there's a little less definition on certain objects. They've definitely fixed the flicker problem some reviewers mentioned, though you'll want to turn off the dynamic lighting response, as it uses a sensor to adjust the backlighting based on the ambient room light, and this can sometimes cause it to switch back and forth between lighting modes. Even with this, if you switch from a dark scene to a really light scene rapidly, the TV takes a second to \"catch up\" by adjusting the backlighting, which is a little obvious.For the deal I got on it due to the 2012 models coming out, I'm happy with the purchase, though it's worth noting that it's not perfect.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "blank screen", "Author": "marva", "ReviewID": "R28CKVQSWAENZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv in november.  everything  was fine until a few days ago.  the tv went blank but you could still see ghosts images.  lasted for a while.  turned the tv off and a few hours later back on.  haven't had problem since.  what does this mean?

I  tried 3 different sets but could not get away from the edge lighting ghosting on letterboxed content. The picture was great on the LED LCD otherwise but the uneven lighting during black / dark screens was too much. I returned the E3 and bought a 50 inch Panasonic S30 Plasma. The even light distribution on the plasma was amazing. Colors popped and motion was vastly superior. Unfortunately the 50 was too big for my room. I bought a 42 inch ST30 at Best Buy and was blown away at the improved picture quality over the S30. Don't get me wrong the S30 looks great but in my opinion the ST30 displays better black levels and improved depth of picture. When I saw the 46 inch version on Amazon for $200 less than I paid for the 42 at Best Buy I had to act. The 42 went back to Best Buy and I have been in heaven with the 46. It is the perfect size for our room. It calibrated the TV thanks to D-Nice and can't believe I have a TV with such amazing picture quality.

I have not experienced any fluctuating brightness.  It appears that has been taken care of and the pre August 2011 models have probably all been sold.This TV does not do well on standard definition.  If you're buying a $1000+ TV, one would assume you would be running HD.  I liked to swap between SD and HD and the SD is bad, worse than my 3 year old 40\" Samsung.  With that said I purchased this TV to run HD.  I broke in the panel using HD color slides for about 100 hours.  After it had been broken in, I used D-nice settings and made minor tweaks.  I personally like the panel light on mid while most others like it on low.  I recommend following D-Nice settings and then adjust it from there to how to you like it.It really shines with HD.  Nature scenes are vivid and the color is excellent.  It took awhile to get skin tones right.  I found a lot that people's faces would have an orangish tint like they were wearing some cheap tanning spray.  I found the warm2 setting makes people come out too orangish.  After getting that adjusted, the TV just looks great.  People look natural and high pace videos do well with no signs of blur.  I also watch a lot of sports and I do not notice in motion blur and the images just look crisp.In terms of 3D, there's just not a lot of content out there.  3D is expensive now, but when Blu Ray first came out, the average Blu Ray movie was about $25 and there weren't many titles available.  In time the price of 3D will come down and more movies will be available.  The 3D on this TV is good.  It took awhile to adjust the 3D settings.  I used a pair of SanSonic universal glasses which were half the price of Panasonic's.  The default settings for 3D are bad.  You'll just need to go into the 3D menu and mess around.  I also found when you play a movie, it defaults to cinema mode.  I like to keep my custom settings for 3D.  I've only watched one movie in 3D so I can't say too much more.  I'm anxious for more 3D content.Overall this TV is a great value.  It competes with TV's that cost $1500-2000.

But looking at the consumer reviews and issues with their LED's, I decided not to go with that. Then I moved to Samsung LED and again the same problem. LG was never my choice. Then I started reading about the plasma and came to know about Kuro and Panasonic. The review of this TV at amazon itself is perfect. I tend to read the 1 stars and 2 stars before I read 5 & 4. All the 1/2 stars reported problem which Panasonic fixed. Well it showed that Panasonic takes care of after sales too.Finally after a month of deliberation, I decided to go for it and ordered one from Amazon. My almost 5 year old was so excited for a big TV. The first TV was shipped via Home Direct and when it came home, the screen had multiple cracks. It was so disappointing for us. I almost decided to ask for refund instead of reshipping and go for Brick-and-Mortar store. Somehow, my experience with Amazon made me to give them another chance.So I asked for another piece. Around same time, Sears came with $899 price and I was able to price match this with Amazon after a simple call. It was like a BF deal.After another 5 days, the TV arrived. This time Ceva was the carrier and the TV was in perfect condition. Two relatively old people came, and I ensured they have a good tip for their effort. After all, it was a happy moment.I ran the break in slides for around 100 hours and then started watching the TV. (I was watching lil bit before the break in was complete), but boy...the quality has stunned me and so has the features. With a yellow light near the TV, and all lights off, the Cinema mode gives such a true skin tone. Watched Oscars on HD and my wife and I were left marvelling at the plasma technology.For anyone on the hook about plasma and torn in deciding between the two, my advice would be to go for plasma. It is a better tested technology than LED/LCD and picture quality is amazing. The newer plasmas have so much features to prevent the screen burn in that this is no longer a concern.We are enjoying this quality TV. Btw, amazon refunded me $50 for the issue with the 1st shipment and so this TV is for $849.

It looks really good hanging on the wall. The picture is bright, it was very easy to set up and we are very pleased with it. We are running it through an Onkyo TX-NR809 7.2 THX2 A/V receiver, a nice receiver for our environment.  No F/B issues at this time. The third-sixth serial number is 1291 with an October 2011 build date.  We have had the TV for about six weeks. I did notice that the first two weeks we had it, on game mode; the whites were so white you couldn't even look at the TV. We could not play certain video games because of the brightness; we had to go to Cinema mode.  After two weeks, all of a sudden the TV got dimmer all across the board. It still looks great, but doesn't seem to have that initial pop that it had out of the box. I do have the CAT set to off.  If any of you tech gurus out there have any idea why the initial brightness is not there anymore, let me know.  Like I said, the TV still looks great, but I can't seem to get that original pop back.  Amazon comes through again, a great TV, with excellent and on time delivery. They really do have the best customer service.  I found the TV cheaper before I bought it, but I wanted to buy it from Amazon for several reasons.  I let Amazon know the lower price the day of purchase; they matched it before the charge showed up on my card. I should have waited though; about two weeks later, just as the 14 day price match was running out, I found it even cheaper yet, 110 dollars cheaper, after the price match, at an approved site.  Amazon would not price match again. Their policy does state only one price match per sale.  I was on my 14th day of the TV being at my house, so not sure if the 14 days was from the day of purchase or day of delivery. I believe it was from the day of purchase. Anyway, I did get about 95 dollars off of Amazon's already low price, so I was still happy, even though the 110 dollars on top of that would have been nice.

This came highly recommended from several of my TV-guru buddies.  I don't regret this purchase at all!There's that thing about plasma's that a lot of people around me were trying to deter me from...but all of them were debunked especially after I bought this, such as:-It's thinner than my Sony LCD!  It's seriously at least 50% thinner.-The colors, even the blacks look spectacular.-Motion smoothing works well.-Very sharp and doesn't run as hot as everyone made it out to be.-Clean and crisp, better than my LCD.-FAST RESPONSE TIME!My big thing was looking for a TV that I would be able to play video games on as well (yes, I'm a nerd but this alone was a big deal-breaker for TV's not just for gaming but even for movies and shows).  Most LCD's I've had to deal with latency issues (where you hear the sound first and images later).  Even if the game had a feature to adjust for the lag, it still couldn't calibrate correctly; furthermore if a game didn't have the features (especially pre-PS3/360 era), you were out of luck.  This TV doesn't even have those problems.  If you play fighting games, you couldn't ask for a TV with quicker response.  For music games (such as Guitar Hero, Beatmania, DDR, etc), this is the TV for you.  Even for titles on the Playstation 2 (or systems that uses component/composite connections), I had pretty much no issues scoring high on older titles without trying to compensate for lag like I had to for my LCD.We've used this TV for movie nights, Super Bowl and sporting events, gaming nights, you name it.

After researching TV's for weeks, I finally decided on plasma over LED/LCD. First, I liked the true to life feel of plasma vs. LED's \"soap opera\" effect. Second, I'm a sports lover, so plasma's 600hz refresh rate was a no-brainer vs. LED's 120/240hz motion-blur-fest, third, plasma's are much cheaper than LED's, so you have more money in your pocket at the end of the day. So, after settling on plasma, and after another week of research, I decided on one TV: the Panasonic TCP55ST30.I found the 55ST30 at my local Sears for $1074.99. That is a rock-bottom price for a 55\" 3D, 1080p, Smart TV. Considering I was expecting to spend anywhere between $1500-$2000 for a TV, to say I was ecstatic would be putting it mildly. We were aware that some models produced before August 2011 had issues with brightness flucuations, but since our model was produced in October 2011, we were good to go.After getting the TV home and unboxed, I found the setup to be extraordinarily simple. We had everything hooked up and ready to go in minutes, and upong turning the TV on found the inital onscreen setup to be just as simple. After answering a few questions we were directed into the WiFi portion of the setup. The included WiFi dongle was attached and found my router easily and within minutes we were up and running and watching TV in stunning 1080p.THE INITAL IMPRESSION:At first, I was NOT blown out of the water. Although the picture was detailed, the colors were washed out and dull and the tv's brightness was lacking. I was disappointed. That was until, however, I discovered that the TV was set to \"standard\" mode. We set it to \"cinema\" mode and then \"game\" mode and THEN we were really COOKING! The colors were VIBRANT and the images POPPED of the screen with a fury. We were amazed by the crispness and clarity fo the images and could not believe how well basic televison looked. Then we moved onto HDTV programming and turned on some college basketball on ESPNHD. That was the next level of WOW! It was if you were there in the arena. It is hard to put into words how amazing this TV looked. The colors were vibrant, but natural (unlike LED's) and the detaisl were amazingly crisp. We could not imagine the TV looking any better...we were WRONG!10 out of 10FIRST IMPRESSION OF BLU-RAY ON THIS TV:We decided to next move from HDTV to Blu-ray. We put in the Blu-ray of Pixar's \"Up\" and our jaws dropped to the floor. The picture was AMAZING. Details that we had never seen before were exploding out of the screen at us. We could not believe our eyes. The crispness and clarity was BREATH-TAKING. It is hard to truly put into words how amazing Blu-ray looks on a really good TV until you actually experience it in your own home, away from the lights of a retail setting. It is a true cinema experience that is unparalelled in its beauty.10 out of 10SMART TV APPS:This was a feature of the TV that we really wanted. We are already memebrs of Netflix on our Xbox360, so we knew that having Netflix streaming on our tv was the next step. The choices available fromt he start are ample. Netflix, Facebook, Cinema Now, MLBTV, NBATV, and Hulu Plus are just some of the apps available right out of the box, not to mention there is a Viera Apps store where you can purchase and download countless other apps and games. The only drawback to this is there is an annoying \"dinging\" noise evertime you cycle through apps.8.5 out of 10VIDEO GAMES:Wow...I mean, WOW!! We hooked up our XBox360 and we were off to the races. We threw in MLB 2K10 and were floored by the detail. It looked like we were watching a TV broadcast and not playing a game. COD: Modern Warfare 3 looked even more incredible. I can only imagine that gaming on a PS3 would look even more amazing!10 out of 103D TECHNOLOGY:We did not purchase anything to use the 3D tech, so I'm sorry to say that I can't rate this. We like having the 3D in case we decide to use the technology in the future, but at the moment that wasn't one of our major concerns in buying a TV.No RatingAUDIO:The audio is standard (if a little on the lower side) and is the only real drawback of the TV. Of course, were hooking into a surround sound system so the TV's audio is immaterial, but for the sake of rating every aspect of the TV as a whole, I have to rate the audio as well to be fair.5.5 out of 10Overall, we have to say that this TV has met and exceeded all expectations. Do yourself a favor: if you're in the market for a 1080p TV, do not get LED, get plasma, and second, make sure it's a Panasonic plasma, and third, make sure it's an ST30, you're gonna get an amazing TV for a price that is affordable on nearly everyone's budget.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent move on my part", "Author": "Wacky Waco", "ReviewID": "R30O3Y0AIKJH8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was time to replace my 52 inch Panasonic projection type and I couldn't have made a better choice than getting this 55 inch Panasonic Plazma - everyone should know that Panasonic actually controls about 90% of the market on Plazma TVs and for the money - I DID GREAT - Beautiful picture, just everything about it is top of the line - too include the price!!!

It's much easier than going through Wii etc.  Have not yet purchased 3D glasses (not included.)The only caution I have (and it's minor) is that the TV advertises itself as being Skype compatible which is true but to do so you have to purchase a either a specific Panasonic branded webcam or a particular Logitech model ($125+ for the cheaper Logitech option (as of last night) and more for the Panasonic, which seems to be harder to locate and seems to have bad reviews generally.)  I should have researched this before purchasing so it's my bad (and it wouldn't have changed whether I bought the TV - just a mild disappointment.)  From what I've read on forums (so whether this is correct or not is debatable, but seems reasonable), the issue is that the TV's processor isn't powerful enough to compress/decompress the video stream, so that functionality needs to be in the webcam.  So, your basic $20 webcam isn't going to cut it.  Again, not a major problem, but it's not something I thought to research before buying.We purchased ours through a large warehouse club - Amazon was out of stock and the shipping charges on other 3rd party sellers made the online option unfavorable at that time.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "P55ST30 knocks my socks off!!!", "Author": "The Beave!", "ReviewID": "R1Y0OZGJ74TZ51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the 55-inch television.

However, I did some homework and found out that plasmas are not the brightest ones and are not comparable with the LED/LCDs for brightness. So I decided to take a risk as this TV offered the best value for money at this huge size.When I bought it home first thing I realized was that the TV is exceptionally bright. All I needed to do was change the default 'standard' picture mode to 'game' or 'cinema' and this TV is brighter than my old LCD. I bet the store people had it on standard mode and that's why I wasn't impressed by it. So, if you are looking to buy this TV, see if you can change the picture mode in the store or try it out at a friend's place. The picture quality is way better than many LCD TVs. Blacks are pitch black and HD picture looks simply gorgeous.Besides the superior picture quality the features such as Viera connect and DLNA make this TV a must buy. TV quickly detected my wifi at home at full signal even though the TV is in the basement and the router is on the upper level. No problems in accessing network apps. I instantly started viewing HD pictures from my online google account. After that I explored the DLNA feature and was surprised to see my network hard drive was already detected and ready to browse. Absolutely no hassle!! I started viewing contents on my hard drive (songs, videos, photos) in seconds. Everything was accessible right away and did take no time to configure anything.I haven't tested the 3D feature yet, but from what I have seen so far, I am convinced that this TV has provided biggest bang for my buck without even getting into the 3D benefits.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Plasma TV", "Author": "RLM - Calif. \"Bandaid55\"", "ReviewID": "R1EA0A1Z2O6XO8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great Plasma TV and fairy easy setup.

You have to pay to play I guess; I probably won't be trying 3d on this tv for a while-Glossy screen could be a Con, however my room has windows behind the viewers of the tv and there's no glare issue.  Might be worse in a bright room so it's something to considerOther thoughts:I did a 100 hour screen aging with this tv, running colored slides and then setup the tv with settings as specified on an hdtv forum (google st30 calibration for a few examples)Comparing a GT30 with Samsung offerings in a big box store, Samsung's plasma image looked better but I took a risk on this as the price was better.

There appear to be plenty of early builds still floating around in inventories, so if you do purchase this TV be aware and be prepared to have to deal with the fluctuating brightness. It's actually way more annoying than I was expecting. However, according to everything I have read, Panasonic is doing an excellent job of servicing these units. So, you can purchase with confidence that if you have the issue it will be fixed, but it will require the extra step/hassle of arranging that fix at some point.Both TVs have also lived up to all of the positive reviews... gorgeous blacks, wonderful picture quality. It's truly a fantastic TV and I believe the best-bang-for-your-buck in its class. My only complaint is that I've been unlucky so far and am 0 for 2 on getting a good one.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing set...Love the Viera Connect feature", "Author": "Scline_2301", "ReviewID": "R3T7GRH5LTTZLV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Could not be happier with this Panasonic unit.

The picture quality is nearly identical on the GT/ST, so i opted for the ST to save a little bit of money.  The GT has a bit darker blacks and more features, but picture quality is the same based on the hours and hours of research i did.  I was pleasantly happy with the picture on the ST, it looks great, especially once calibrated with the Spears and Munsil DVD.  I'm comparing this to the D8000, which is the top of the line plasma panel by Samsung.  You can't go wrong with the Panasonic TV's in my opinion.  My brother own's 3 of them, the original one he bought 7 years ago still works flawlessly without a single dead pixel.The ST is a great tv and a great value for the money, especially if you don't care about the extra internet features, which it has, but i didn't need.

Shipped from Phoenix AZ, serial number XX1244, build date September 2011! This is my 3rd set.First set was a 60GT30 from BB, noticed green blob on a gray screen and $500 more than this set so I returned. Second set was a Samsung 59D7000 from Amazon but that set buzzed too much, could not connect to wifi, really flimsy looking, and cheaply built (even though it look cool). So I sent that set back and ordered this 60st30.First off shipping via CEVA is 100% better than Pilot. Two guys actually took it out of the box, helped assembled, and put it on the stand for me. The guys from Pilot just wanted me to sign the paper, didn't even want to wait for me to check for cracks on the screen (I made them wait). Just wanted to drop it off and run off as fast as they could.When I first saw the TV, I thought they had mistakenly sent me the 60GT30 since the bezel looked so good. Also it was so much thinner than I anticipated. So if you're deciding whether to spend an extra $300 for a nice bezel, DONT'T! It's no worth it. Spend that money only if you want an extra HDMI, THX (which I won't be using anyways since I plan on using CUSTOM mode), or if you want to mount your TV as close to the wall as possible (don't recommend this since you'll have a pretty hard time plugging anything into TV after it's mounted. You will need about 1.5-2\" from wall to TV for clearance of cable and bottom speaker protrusion.Now that the TV is on the stand, I can tell you I have no regret getting the ST over the GT (also another reason I got the Samsung because I thought it looked cooler). So even if all three sets worked perfectly, I would still get the ST and save at least $300 over other 2 sets. So far I haven't watched much TV but all three sets looked about the same to me, I actually like the panasonic better than the samsung. If you've done any research you know all these sets have similar picture quality so can't go wrong with any of them.

Around 1PM I called CEVA while i was at work to verify the delivery and this time window. The rep from CEVA confirmed this and said I was set. I thought this would be perfect because I was planning on surprising my wife after she left the house at 1PM. When I hung up, I headed back to my desk and get a call from a weird number. So I answered thinking it was CEVA. It sure was!!! However it was the delivery guy calling saying he is outside my house door and my wife was in the background. To remind you it was only 1:05PM. I told him to come back at 4 when I get off work and that I will set it up when I get home. That was my only negative experience.What was positive was that they came exactly at 4 ( I actually saw them waiting down my street when I got home lol), took the tv out of the box, put it on the stand, and turned it on, which was connected to a cable source. It literally took them 5 mins. The wife came home and was still surprised but I wish I could have seen her initial reaction.Now for the TV! This TV was shipped from the Arizona distribution center and I ended up getting an April build. At first I was somewhat discouraged because it was not a post august build. But after reading many thread posts on AVSFORUM, this set can be fixed by a technician that panasonic sends out and can be fixed in about 15 mins. However when I turned on the tv, I looked for the fluctuating brightness and I only saw minor fluctuations every once in a while. Besides that everything is exceptional. The colors are natural and the blacks are black. Before I used D'nice slides I was watching the Thursday Night Football Game (Marshawn Lynch=Beast Mode). There was no Image Retention, no Green Blobs, and no buzzing. These were the main things I was looking for if I was gonna return the set.Overall this is a great set. I highly recommend this, especially for under $800.Word of Advice: \"Don't be discouraged by a model# that is not post august build because that can be fixed!!! In my opinion, return if you have blobs, buzzing, or image retention.This tv beats any led/lcd tv any day of the week. The pq is amazing. colors and blacks are exceptional.

(I have owned various models such as a JVC 32\" CRT which was garbage after two years but my little Sony 12\" CRT model is still picture perfect).  After reading extensive reviews and debating between Plasma and LED-LCD and realizing both technologies have their positives and negatives it came down to projected life expectancy, as I do not like throwing money away.

Much has been stated on some D-Nice settings for \"burn in\" and so forth,  but with labeling of the calibration testing \"at your own risk\" I would just as assume skip it.  I did however take the advice of plasmabuyingguide and used their setting with a slight adjustment on  a few colors. Picture preference is a personal preference and should not be dictated by anyone else.  My only advice is to ensure you follow the instructions and place the picture in \"home mode\" as it is defaulted to in-store display setting and set to the hightest settings.The sound is very good especially for the size of the speakers and can be adjusted (Extra bass, simulate surround, etc..).  I use the speakers when viewing normal tv and use my home theater audio when viewing movies.  Setup is simple and there is a firmware update available upon entering vieracast.

Picture is great, local channels have now even become nice to watch and movies, especially blu rays have a whole new appearance that I never knew with my old Samsung rear projection.  The wi-fi was quick as easy to setup, maybe took me 10 minutes and I was up and rolling, letting my 3 year old watch some \"clix\" i.e. Netflix.  It streams well with only one hiccup in the last day and the options with Viera Cast are very good.  Remote has one option that I love which you can rarely find anymore but I'm a sucker for backlit remote controls, call me crazy!!  Everything works great and I find the only problem is a slight buzzing noise that varies from time to time and is rather annoying so I will contact Amazon to see if this is normal or not.  Lastly I have found 3D options are rather limited but if you have a PS3 there is a movie link called VUDU which has some 3D movies that you can watch 2 minute trailers on to get a good idea on what you will be experiencing.  So get yourself one and begin enjoying an amazing TV!  Thanks Panasonic, you did well!!7/3/11  I have been having a problem with a buzzing noise from the back of the TV and have contacted Panasonic who will be sending someone to look at it in a few days.  The brightness of the picture makes the buzzing vary and can be heard when my TV is turned up to a 40, so it is rather loud and annoying.  I will keep review updated when Panasonic comes by.7/8/11  The technician said the noise was normal and to just keep listening to make sure it didn't get any louder.  I found this rather odd but I've never owned a Plasma before and a little noise coming from the back for the amazing 3D and great picture, ahh, who cares.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "I really loved this TV", "Author": "Gabriel", "ReviewID": "R26KPE3FH3C16O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all I have to say that I bought this TV to be used in Venezuela.

Could save $50 while ordering from Electronics Expo but after reading several pages of their rating/feedback, the concerns about their reputation have affected my decision. Plus, a previous TV was from Paul's TV too (fulfilled by Amazon too), so I was biased. I have experience of exchanging/returning three big and heavy (160 lb!) TVs due to defects, so if there is a chance that a seller will send a return item to me scares me a lot! By the way, if you are curious, returned TVs were from Sanyo, Polaroid (with a Samsung panel and electronics inside), and Sony brands.Panasonic has a strong green/ecological program and as a somewhat environmentally concerned consumer, I like their program and it has affected my decision making to some degree.The box arrived via Home Direct (one day late), but the driver has helped to carry it in and unpack (Big Thanks to him!).This TV was version MG1245xxxx and manufactured in September 2011. If it is important for you, the assembly was done in Mexico, but through the vent holes it is possible to see that the panel itself was manufactured in Japan.The sound of the speakers and the inputs/outputs are not important to me. Honestly speaking, if one is willing to spend this amount of money for such a TV, one should be expected to spend $200-$400 on a receiver. In the older days plasma TVs were not real TVs, they were HD monitors and I would be willing to buy this TV for the same price even if it would only have one HDMI input and no speakers.The media player (with AVCHD support) is a nice feature. Thanks to Panasonic for the continued inclusion of the SDHC card reader! Have not tested with SDXC yet.Regarding the black level. If you look at the screen, even when the TV is off, the screen NEVER looks as black as the bezel. When the TV is on, and there is a second or two of black between credits and the action, for instance, then that black does not look as black as the bezel too, and looks a little bit lighter than the appearance of the screen when the TV is off. Some people in on-line forums explain that plasmas have deep blacks that cannot be achieved by LCD and LED-based LCD panels because each individual plasma cell can be turned off completely. Well, I expected a deep black (like the black bezel) in those pixels, but it is not happening (Would it be a case with OLEDs? We'll see in 10 or so years). It's not a con, just to keep the evaluation objective!There was a lot of temptation about a 70\" LED LCD Sharp, but paying $600 more for a brand that is valued less than Panasonic seemed to be excessive. Yes, there is a difference in power consumption (P65ST30 consumes 500 watts versus around 300 watts for Sharp), but the quality of the picture and durability are of the higher priority when it comes to this type of the item.Speaking about durability. Although Panasonic is usually regarding as a long-lasting brand, but we all know that some pieces of electronics fail earlier than other, so I've added a 4-year extended warranty from SquareTrade just in case (the experience of returning three other TVs is still in my memory).UPDATE from May 18th, 2012: Not sure whether it is to the fact that this TV is bigger or because it has better dynamic range and better rendition of colors and shadows comparing to a 42\" LED LCD by Panasonic, but it seems that while watching all the same movies from Blu-ray discs and from DVDs, now we see more details, which seemed to be missed with the previous TV. Maybe it's a combination of the size and the dynamic range. By the way, a blu-ray player, connected to this TV, is Panasonic DMP-BD45 Ultrafast-Booting Blu-ray Disc Player (Black). It is connected via an expensive HDMI cable. It's the same setup that was used with the 42\" LED LCD model.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "(2) TVs DOA", "Author": "Enrico Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R3KU2UIHC56FAA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this because of the great price that was posted on Amazon($1500).  A week later, the first tv shows up at my door, and I unbox it while the driver waited.  Upon inspection, it was discovered that there was considerable damage to the side of the tv.  The front flashing was bowed forward, and it looked like it was struck by a fork from a forklift on the side.  There was no obvious damage to the box itself.  The driver took it back, and I contacted customer service.The second go around, there was spider web cracking on the upper portion of the screen.

I have two friends who bought 60 inch TV's and they both said the TV was too big, opting to go with a 51\" TO 55\" instead, and moving the monster in the basement.  Aside from being too big for 8.5 feet away, the picture is amazing.  Now the big question... do you need 3D? I was on the fence about this, but we went with a 3D TV just because it's cool and it's better to have it and not need it than need it not have it... right? Well, maybe not. We went down to Blockbuster to rent a 3D movie... nothing/zip/nada. We went to Best Buy and bought the last Harry Potter for $30 in 3D (I hadn't seen it) and IMAX under the sea in 3D (also $30). Under the sea was sorta cool watching it on some $50 SainSonic 3D active shutter glasses we got on Amazon for $50 each. Harry Potter on the other hand was lame... there, I said it. The movie may not be lame, but the 3D added nothing for me. Would I go 3D again... prolly not. Would I go 65\" at 8.5 feet, definitely not. I can't wait to get into a space big enough to enjoy this TV from 10 feet away.  Now for the wireless... do you need this? I say no. If you want to streamline Netflix, do it from the Blu-Ray. I bought the Harmon Kardon AVR3600 for its music power and the Oppo 93 to streamline video, so why do I need the TV to talk to the internet? It does, and I may need it later, but I really don't need the Amp, Blu-ray and TV to do the same thing.  For the record I am very happy with this purchase. The guy helped me unpackaged it and set it on the stand.  He said Amazon's return policy was the best, and no matter what, make sure to keep the box. He relayed a story of a BestBuy TV he delivered and was standing there as the guy was talking to BestBuy, explaining to them it arrived broken. BestBuy advised him to keep the TV and told him that returning the TV that day (though it was broken) was not an option. Unlike Amazon, that makes sure it's all cool before you accept it, I found this cool.  In the end, would I buy this again... absolutely. It needs two more MartinLogan Motion 10's, but I'll wait till I can get them for $125 each.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "the best TV i have ever owned...", "Author": "brent8577", "ReviewID": "R2A0EXT1G9W7TH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 3/13/12: originally, i had stated this was the best tv i had ever owned, but that was based mostly on size and features at the time. i ran 100 hours of break-in slides, changed the picture settings to D-Nice's recommended settings, then started watching movies. i also stated that my previous tv was a 2009 Toshiba LCD and that i could not see blacker blacks or notice a huge improvement in picture quality. i have since bought 3rd gen Panasonic glasses and begun watching 3D IMAX docus through my laptop. i have never seen picture this good. i have also not seen LED LCD in a home,a Samsung plasma, nor any of the $3000+ TVs, but this was my pick. my build date is October 2011. the price i paid is unbelievable and from now on, i know to buy a tv right before the new models come out. i watched Up, Toy Story 3, and Avatar (very disappointed in that one) in the theaters and now at home, and i can say with 100% certainty that the picture and 3D on this is better than the movie theater. it is obviously not as large, but if you have a few grand on 5.1+ speakers then you will be alright never going to the theater again.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "Zalzan", "ReviewID": "R34K84QOBVL3VZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For my first plasma TV decided to go big and got this 55\" TV.

But 2 months in I am really enjoying the amazing picture and the ease with which I can switch between TV, DVD, Blu-Ray, games, etc.  Everything looks great on it and I appreciate being able to customize the picture for each device.That said, I have dinked around with some of the extra features and I have to say they are not worth it.  The wireless connection is ridiculous in that it often forgets to connect and you end up waiting needlessly while it finds the signal and reconnects.  Even then, the Internet features of this TV are a joke.  Netflix is a good example - the streaming content is old and not worth the money.  If you want Netflix movies, get the DVD by mail service.The TV allegedly syncs with external Panasonic devices like the Panasonic blu-ray player I purchased with this TV.  This does not work as advertised. I purchased a soundbar with this system - unfortunately it's a different brand so there is no syncing there either.Finally, I cannot believe you cannot program the Panasonic remotes to operate BOTH a Panasonic TV AND a Panasonic Blu-Ray at the same time.  One would think that technology has progressed far enough that you could use one remote to operate both, WITHOUT pressing a button to switch between devices each time.

The input signals I am using are component and 1080i only, but I still find no flaws with any of the pictures.I have a 4 year old panasonic which is still going great.The screen is slightly more reflective than my old TV, which does creates a distraction in day time when Sunlight is directly coming in the room.I initially bought a Sharp Quattaron because of LED hype, but as soon as it was setup my eyes could not adjust. I thought may be it is getting from 50 to 60 inch so I gave it some time, played with its settings, colors, contrast etc, Did all the readings, but could not get it to work properly.When I watched it from front, the colors were dull, so I increased the backlight, but when the white scenes came the light caused a glare and I had to look away from the TV. And when I watched it from 30 degree angle the pic looked washed out.Not sure if that was with my tv or in general but I could not afford a 60 inch mistake in my living room looking at me for next 5 years.This Panasonic TV was right on as soon as it came out of the box. I like vivid settings, and everything was ok.Also connected this to youtube, the picture is ok, slightly dull, but so is the content on youtube :) not much to watch there anyways.The text entry is on search page was 20 years old technology, but you can connect your USB keyboard if you want. Good thinking to put USB slots and SD card slot sideways so when it is mounted on the wall they are still accessible.Sound is also ok for normal transmission, news, serials etc, but if you really want to enjoy some space alien action flick it's better to connect it to a good sound system.Last thing about the Bezel, CNET gave some concerns about the surrounding bezel and I was worried how it will look on the wall. Actually it looks better than my old TV and the Sharp I bought.

This being the latest addition.  We have an older plasma which we still love after 6 years, upgraded from 42\" to 55\" and feng shui'd the TV set up.  Absolutely beautiful HD picture.  Standard def is what it is on any bigger TV, pretty clear on popular channels and crappier on your local UHF type channels. We sit about 10 feet away from the screen and it looks perfect on anything HD of course.  Sports are great, except hockey.  Sometimes there's a flicker during center ice shots which we never really noticed on the 42, thought more of it as camera flashes.  On the 55 if you look for the flashing you can pick it out, after 5 minutes of concentrating on the game and not obsessing about the flicker you never notice it.  NOT AN FBR ISSUE, THIS ONLY HAPPENS DURING VERY BRIGHT WHITE SHOTS OF ICE for example.  My build date was October so the famous Panny fBR issue has been resolved now.  No problems from dark to light shots, just when the auto brightness limiter kicks in during extended bright ice shots.  No problems with bright scenes in movies or TV.  When we look for it now we see it on our 42, but you really stop paying attention after awhile.  I thought I was sending the unit back because of it, but I've read it's a pretty standard issue with a few brands, so there is no way I'm going with anything but Panasonic for my plasma choice.Used D-nice's set up for color contrast, brightness, pro settings etc. without using color slides for the first 100 hours as suggested.  The setup is beautiful.  Takes away the haze I was seeing using the pro settings with my own settings.  The way I think of break-in is if Panny sent out TV with a known issue of needing break-in time they couldn't make such a quality piece of equipment and their popularity couldn't be as high as it is.  cnet raves about the ST, GT and VT TV's.  The ST is by far the best bang for the buck.  VT too much unless dedicated to majority of viewing as 3D.  That leaves the GT vs. ST, and what I've heard is PQ is comparable.

No,but certainly adds depthto the picture.I also bought a Panasonic 3D BD player and 3D Glasses.The 3D glasses are the lighest in weight ( 1 ounce) on the market.They are nothing like the clunky ones they had last year.After a few minutes you get so wrapped up in watching 3D that you forget you have them on.The advertising said that these glasses can be worn overregular glasses.

I watched the HP movie on blue ray to make sure the there was no FBr issue. After running the D-Nice slides and using his setting the screen looks awesome. I have a panny S1 and despite having its black issues it is still great.Then I found out that Panasonic 3D glasses were in really short supply. But, after doing some research found out that xPand universal ones work with the tv and even the Sony playstation 3D glasses work with this tv. I bought the Sony 3D glasses for $40 each and I didn't have to do anything other than charge the glasses. As soon as I turned the glasses on I started enjoying the 3D, I don't have a 3D blue ray player so I watched Gnomio and Juliet on Showtime 3D and it did show good dept perception. Watched Tron 3D but didn't like but that had more to do it with me watching it during daytime with lots of light coming in from the windows. Overall I am very happy with my purchase. I am not sure if I will invest $250 or around on panasonic 3D glasses when I can get cheaper universal ones which work with this TV.I tried the viera connect, it sees my HTPC but for some reason doesn't play/show any jpegs or video files. But, thats not a deciding factor for me because I rarely use that feature. Netflix was good but not as good/sharp as I stream from my xbox 360. Youtube works great if you can get over the search using ur remote.Update: This morning I was watching News and all of a sudden I hear what sounded like a loud spark sound and TV went black(no picture). The red light in the bottom front was still on. I unplugged the tv and plugged it back and nothing. So, in a little after 24 months its dead. All my home theater setup is connected to surge protectors and only the tv went out, the sound through cable box and receiver was still going on. For something that costs $1000 it should last much longer. My old 46\" panasonic plasma is still going great, that was the reason I bought this one.

My set has developed what I consider to be a serious problem on all of its HDMI inputs with both cable TV programming and Blu-ray discs.  If I use HD Size 2, which negates any overscan and results in a 1:1 pixel accurate picture and my brightness is set above 54, thin illuminated lines appear, usually on one vertical edge and an adjacent horizontal edge.  This is most evident when a program or movie is presented in anything above a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, which many of them are now.  As the brightness control pushes up the edge lines illuminate more.  A service tech replaced the set's A-board but that did not solve the problem. He did accurately report the problem to Panasonic. Despite the fact that no ST owners on AVS Forum can duplicate this problem and I couldn't duplicate it on an 46ST30 or 50GT30 at my local Frys, Panansonic insists that the set is in \"normal operating condition\" and now refuses to resolve the problem.  They blamed the broadcast industry for \"embedded data\" (maybe on cable but certainly not on Blu-rays) and then claimed that my Sony 3D Blu-ray player must be sending this \"data\" to the set.  Absolute hogwash!  With my older Panasonic Blu-ray player the set displays the same issue. They have, despite my trying to rationally discuss this with them, steadfastly refused to honor their own warranty, leaving me with a situation where if I choose not to sacrifice 5% of my picture with HD Size 2 I must keep my brightness at 54 or below. In effect, I am stuck with the overscan of HD Size 1. This is apparently normal to this company.  I guarantee you that if everyone's set displayed this kind of \"normalcy\", Amazon would be flooded with returns of these sets.

I am sure if i tried a replacement i may have succeeded in keeping it based on other 5* reviews here on this model.anyway, i was back on the market and i realized that if you are a 3D fan you got to go for the biggest screen...so was looking at Mitsubishi 82' TV till i saw a demo at frys and it was so washed out and horrible that i realized my folly of not looking at 3D projectors as they are not only fraction of cost but also are most portable unlike these behemoths. After a lot of research i bought the Optima HD66 and 3DXL and a 120 inch Favi screen...all for under 1k...1/2 the cost of 65 inch TV.For anyone wanting to go for the best 3D experience, all i can say is this is the best route. The image is HUGE beautiful and totally immersive. ABSOLUTELY ZERO cross talk with the Optoma 3D DLP Link glasses which not only were a lot more comfortable than Panasonic's but are also big and give you complete immersion, nothing short of the theater 3D experience in the privacy of your home ! You realized that this is how thing should work in the first place ! Watching some scenes in Open season and Tangled i almost jumped into the other world (people often say 3D TV's give them a window into another world but a 120 inch screens opens a \"wall\" through which you can walk into the other !). On the 65 inch TV the 3D effects would only stop at the TV surface...with the 120 inch screen they truly pop out of the screen. Well i am not a big fan of cheap pop out effects, but i prefer 3D for the depth it gives and the bigger screen literally opens another world for example....the roller coaster ride in Despicable Me put a big smile on my face and many butterflies in my stomach as it gives the feeling of literally sitting in that car !! (why dont they make a 3D bluray just for roller coasters ? whoever reads this and makes one...dont forget to send me some royalty please ! )Ofcourse i understand that projector is not the most convenient setup for many and they dont compare with black levels of Plasma...but the technology has evolved so much that there is no equivalent in the TV world for the size you need for 3D. While it i ideal to have a Home Theater Room to setup the projector, you can pull off a very satisfactory portable setup even in small apartments. While panasnoic give 1080p 3D on 65 inch TV compared to 720 3D of the Optoma, there is no comparison as far as cross talk and size is concerned.By no means i want to put down this brand (i own many electronics from Panasonic and i love them and hence i even purchased the TV in the first place)...but for anyone who is purely looking for the best 3D experience i urge you to consider projector route.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV after two repair issues", "Author": "rbuzby \"rbuzby\"", "ReviewID": "R7Z7KYUAF4K5W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Do some research.

Although it has great picture quality and a convenient and powerful UI, it fails on two of the most important features for us.  The first is that it cannot receive about half of the OTA digital channels in our area, whereas the LG LED HDTV we bought at the same time tunes them in fine using the same inputs.  This won't be an issue if you use a digital cable or satellite box, but if you're using an antenna or basic cable/CATV, you're going to be missing a lot of channels.It also lacks RCA audio outputs and even a headphone jack.  This means you can't use an external speaker system or any products like TV Ears.  This an especially important omission because the built-in speakers are very weak (they have almost no bass response).  It does have a digital optical output, but this means you have to have a newer, much larger, and much more expensive home theater receiver and speaker system to boost the audio output.  We like the LG setup: We plug a set of good PC speakers into the headphone jack which means we can use the standard remote to change the volume (universal remotes are a major pain IMHO because they never seem to have all the same controls as the standard remote, which means you always have to keep multiple remotes handy).Oh, and of course it has the same dim display and shiny screen as most (all?) plasmas.

Firstly let me point out that the Panasonic replaced a SONY XBR television I purchased a few years ago (and a tough act to follow) and was deeply in love with. On setting up the Panasonic I played around with the various video settings and settled on the \"Vivid\" choice which somewhat brightens the colors making it more to my liking. All the way through I was extremely disappointed with the picture on the Panasonic finding it dull and lifeless. The reds, blues  and greens were all quite muted in color and I do admit that I prefer perhaps somewhat exaggerated somewhat vivid images. The whites were grey and despite all my attempts to correct this tweaking the video settings I was unable to. Interestingly, using the \"Brightness\" control did nothing at all to the picture as if it wasn't working at all. I saw little to no difference moving the brightness all the way down to all the way up. In addition, I had a similar experience with the \"Color\" control where it caused little discernible difference from all the way down to all the way up. It was as if these controls weren't working at all.  The 3D glasses were on back order so I never had a chance to sample the 3D, deciding instead to return the TV as quickly as possible. The first flat screen TV I ever purchased (about 10 years ago) was a 42 inch Panasonic Plasma 720p which I was quite satisfied with. In addition,about 2 years ago I purchased another plasma from Panasonic from the G25 series in my opinion performed substantially better then the current ST30 series.

All the reviews were great \"looks amazing\" \"its almost life like\" \"its crystal clear\". Clearly no one knows what a good tv is. The tv is VERY pixelated no matter what source of signal I use. All my sources are using HDMI. There is ALOT of noise in the picture which makes it look horrible. I saw people complaining about flickering, I almost wish I had that problem. I spent hours adjusting settings and still crappy. I am not a happy camper to say the least. To be quite honest my 5 year old sharp aquos delivered a MUCH cleaner image than this tv does. I am keeping the tv though, cause well its to much of a hassle to return.

It was supposed to be a \"New\" set - well, compared to \"used\" that was true, but it was not new. I just received it in April 2012 yet the set was manufactured in July, 2011; hence, it was not what I would consider an up-to-date TV - rather like buying a 2011 car in 2012 and having it sold as \"New.\" I'm sure the technology and/or features have changed with the current year.2 It was advertised as a 3D set - it may well have stated that 3D glasses were an option or not provided, etc., but I certainly did not see that notice, and therefore, was less than thrilled to find out I had to purchase the glasses separately. To m mind, it would be like buying a color TV and then being advised that the color part had to be purchased as an add-on.3. Lastly, and a minor point, but as I could not be there to accept the shipment, a friend signed the acceptance order which had checked that the delivery people had uncrated and set up the TV - they did not (nor did I wish them to), but I thought it was curious that they had so stated that they had performed that service.Regards,BJ", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor picture quality", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R1XPC1KVESSCCS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Panasonic typically has a good reputation, but the picture quality on this TV is really not good.

I like the picture, clarity, options. However, my unit was defective. No physical damage was noted to the box or TV, make sure you check these before you accept the delivery. If damaged and you accept the TV you own it. There are blue and white dots all over the screen appearing in the same areas. Vertical lines of bad cells turning white and blue when its supposed to be brown or black. It is much worse during dark movies and shows. Looking past this glaring defect, I can see why others love the TV. I love the colors and features and internet is handy. I am currently trying to get this TV returned and I will update / change my review if the new unit, that I hope to obtain, is not a defect also.

And this review isn't so much on the product as it is on the experience of purchasing a television through Amazon. In a word, don't! They will not stand behind their claims or the 3rd parties they work with to guarantee customer satisfaction. And their A-Z Guarantee program is a joke. My elderly parents are stuck with a broken television situation that Amazon refuses to make right. I'm 28 years old, I've been purchasing products through Amazon for over the last 10 years, but unfortunately after the experience I've had trying to purchase a Christmas present television for my parents, never again will I give this company another dollar. There's no great purpose in writing this review, because again it's not a comment on the product, from what I've read it's a great tv set.

I have not tested internet connection yet.Reason to purchase this brand: #1 Panasonic is the most reliable brand in the market today and I do not want to pay $60 an hour to have it fixed in the next few years; I do not make that salary myself. #2 Lab tests indicate that plasma TV's have better picture quality than LCD and LED. On the other hand if you are concerned about energy consumption; LED screens are much more energy efficient than plasma or LCD; to me reliability and picture quality have priority over consumption.
