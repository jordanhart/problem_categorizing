I bought the L22W761 but quickly realized that it was more of a computer monitor than a TV.  Check out [...] for more info.One thing that is common between the 861 and 761 is that the sound is awful.  If you have the 761 that is easily remedied by plugging in an inexpensive set of computer speakers for $20-30.  However the headphone jack on the 861 is INPUT ONLY??!!  After contacting AOC the only option on the 861 for audio out is SPDIF. (digital audio) Well that's great if you want to sink another $150-200 into a sound system that has SPDIF input.Regardless I still went w/ the 861 b/c it has more TV like features.  For example, there is a \"LAST\" button on the tv remote so you can switch between the last channel viewed.  Check out the OWNERS MANUAL for each on the AOC website.The picture is nice on both sets.  This size tv works well for a small room or niche area.If you can buy this for under $250 I'd say it's a \"go\".  Overall I'm pleased with the performance after a couple months.Best regards.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "22\" AOC Envision L22W761 720p Widescreen LCD HDTV General Features: Black casing\n22-inch LCD display 16:10 widescreen aspect ratio 0.282 x 0.282 mm pixel pitch\n1000:1 contrast ratio 300 cd/m2 brightness 5 ms response time Integrated ATSC/QAM/NTSC TV tuners\nMTS + SAP integrated sound system Closed Caption support V-Chip Parental Control\n480i, 480p, 720p and 1080i input capable - By law, California shipments of this product are subject to an $16.00 Electronic Waste Recycling Fee", "Name": "Aoc L22W761 22-Inch LCD TV HDMI Tuners", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ueMZ68tL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001APUGKI"}}
