The power source of the TV is failing, and now the TV only stays on for a few seconds before turning itself off.  Of course the warranty period expired right after we had moved and didn't have time to immediately file a complaint.  Searching the internet you will see this is a common problem with Sylvania TVs.  I have yet to get a good response from Sylvania.If you want to spend $400 for a TV that might last a year or two, go ahead and buy this.  Otherwise, keep looking.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "High-Definition LCD TV\n2 HDMI; 1 rear 1 side\nAdaptive 3D Y/C Comb Filter\nSleep Timer\nTrilingual On Screen Display (English / Spanish / French)", "Name": "Sylvania LD320SS2 32-Inch 720p TV Combo", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415Tf3qFs8L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004UAG3RK"}}
