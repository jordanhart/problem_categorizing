When gaming make sure you put in the right mode for that.  This will shut-off all of the extraneous processing of the signal that isn't needed.  I played Halo, (legendary level), and had no problems at all.  It was as responsive as the old CRT that it (finally) replaced.  The graphics when gaming were just absolutely stunning...I keep the \"smooth motion\" setting turned off most of the time.  For one thing it creates too much of the \"soap opera effect\" when turned up on medium or high.  I think all lcd based tv's are the same too.  The picture looks just fine without it.  Most of the \"break-up\" or blurring seen at the stores is due to the cable signal being split between so many units.  The smooth motion setting does come in handy with live, fast action sporting events though.I was just a bit leary of purchasing this unit but wanted to stay on a budget.  Well I just finished watching \"The Expendables\" and the picture rocked.  No pixelation or blurring that I could pickup on.  I imagine a real video aficionado could run a list of less-than-desirable features on this tv compared to the $2500 units but for most I think it would do just fine.This tv isn't wireless so I bought a BluRay player which has built-in WiFi.  This works fine for streaming movies and other online stuff usually offered with the most recent tv's.  Anyways I happy with the purchase and look forward to years of service from it.  Hope this helps.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is a great set for the price.", "Author": "V. Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2RV8RS6LV2N0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This set works great and I've had no issues with it at all.  However, there are some things that a buyer should know prior to purchasing any LCD.Because of the picture processing on some sets, sometimes there will be video lag.  This is a known issue for all brands of lcd televisions with picture post processing.  To accommodate for this issue, newer DVD and Blu Ray players have a delay setting for audio so you can sync up the audio to the delay caused by the picture processing.However, the delay obviously won't do for gaming.  If you want to configure the set for gaming, it's a simple process -1> Go to your picture options, then set the picture mode to the gaming preset2> At the bottom of the menu, select \"more\" for additional options3> In the additional picture options, ensure that:  > Smooth motion is off (this is the picture post processing that makes it look like you're on set)  > Fast response is on.4> Enjoy.It's not perfect as the backlighting isn't completely even, but it's good enough for the price and the size.  It's only really noticeable when a scene is completely black.There's a bit of stutter with the smooth motion feature, but nothing that you don't see on the pricier Samsung sets.  Though it produces that video camera soap opera look that is fun for animation and CG, turning off the feature will return the picture to a more traditional look (and reduce lag).The speakers are also sufficient for general use but if you want to get into a movie/game, you'll want to hook up a nice surround system.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality", "Author": "Ramon Leal \"Ray-Ray\"", "ReviewID": "R2HXCJLSBA2LID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I need to start by saying that I bought mine refurbished. My question is, why? I heard some saying they have issues with this item. I don't have the problems others have. I paid $667. I would think about it if I had to pay regular price though. Especially if your going to experience problems. I have seen that the video tends to speed up to catch up with the audio, I think, when streaming on Netfix. As far as playing dvds and playing games, I have had no problems.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "tvland", "ReviewID": "R2EKXRSGYER4F9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Vizio product nice!!  Easy to set up and start using right out of the box.  Don't have HD through our cable provider, but even without HD nice quality.

Unfortunately, it has some serious short comings.The random reboot issue is an absolute disgrace.  I don't know how this passed any form of quality control.  While it doesn't occur that frequently, it is very annoying.  While I might not mind a random reboot every now and then, my TV's volume will increase significantly before rebooting and I am unable to silence it.  Essentially, the speaker volume increases 100% for 10-15 seconds, the picture produces doppelgangers and the TV will reboot.  Again, the TV becomes unresponsive immediately before it reboots so the entire household has to hear whatever is currently playing on the TV.My TV also has a very poor ability to handle the signal from my cable box.  I don't know why, but it's the only TV in the home that has problems.  It's almost like the picture is 5-10 pixels too low and there is static or scrambled pixels at the top of the TV screen.  Again, this issue doesn't occur on any other TVs in my home.  However, play Xbox 360 or Wii on this TV and the picture is fine.  On the same topic, very frequently (every hour or two) the sound will either flicker on and off rapidly or be mute altogether.  The only way to remedy this problem is by switching to another channel until the sound corrects itself.  Again, I switch my cable box between this Vizio and a Westinghouse house TV and the Westinghouse never experiences any of these problems.The sound bar also leaves something to be desired.  It's not terrible, however it's sometimes difficult to hear voices due to drowning out by background noise.  Sometimes when watching a baseball game, it's difficult to hear the commentator's voices, or when watching Late Night Talk Shows, the audience applause will be terribly loud in comparison to the host's voice.Minus the above issues, this is a good TV.  I have a 32' and 19' Vizio and absolutely love them.  This TV just has too many problems for my liking.  I got it for a decent price ($850), and while it's under warranty, the store or manufacturer aren't going to do anything to rectify the problem.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Id say its a good buy.", "Author": "blakc", "ReviewID": "R23P87D3YML753", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK PLEASE KEEP IN MIND YOU ARE GETTING A 55 INCH TV AT GREAT PRICE!!! The component connections on the TV are not good. I noticed that when I had my 360 hooked up with HD! The only thing i use them for is the audio for my turtle beach headset now. No problems with that. So had to switch to HDMI for the vidio! The TV also was skipping a little during fast motion. But I have a 90 day return policy and decided to give the TV a chance since I play allot of games and wanted size for a banging price. After playing about 15 hours on the TV I have not noticed a skipping problem on games, DVDs, or my HD cable! It just has to warm up like anything you use. It does take a few second for the TV to switch outputs. But i have patience. The speakers do suck! I would suggest getting a sound bar/surround sound WITH A SUB!!!! Who uses TV speakers still anyways! I also have my computer hooked up and i do notice a SLIGHT lag. But that does not bother me anymore. It looks great and no skipping on youtube or vladtv videos! OVER ALL I AM HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE! I would recommend this TV!PROS : 4 HDMI Ports / GREAT PRICE FOR A 55 INCH LCD! / RBG and USB plug.CONS : Speakers / Not being able to turn off the Vizio light. / Remote is pretty basic looking.Purchased at Costco for 979.99 W/O Tax. 90 Day Return , 2 Year Warranty ( No extra charge. ) :)", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Basic LCD HDTV for those who don't want the bleeding edge", "Author": "Caveat Emptor", "ReviewID": "RA6WPFZHOOR70", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is just fine.

Parker \"Just the facts\"", "ReviewID": "R1SLWEKMKDEZ8A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Luckily, I purchased this set from a source with a 90 day return policy.  At 60 days, the ever increasing random reboots meant that this set went back.  I don't know what it is with Vizio and their larger sets.  I have a 32\" Vizio that has been rock solid.  A few years ago, I tried to get a 42\" Vizio, and it had problems that lead to it being returned for a Sharp which has been rock solid.  I thought maybe they were better now and went for this 55\" set.  All was well, and it appeared to be a good buy.  At this price point, it is a lot of TV for the money.Early on, there were a couple of reboots.  The first one, was a 'what was that' response, and we didn't think much of it.  Then the second.  Around 60 days, the random reboots had become much more frequent.  Finally, we had to call it and pack it back up for return.  Hopefully, the Sony replacement will be a good one.While a bit idealistic with today's technology, in my mind, you should turn on the TV and that's it.  When you're done, you turn it off.  With all of the new fangled technology, it just seems that there are various gremlins that creep in.  Bottom line - If you get a good set, you'll be happy and think you got a steal of a deal.  Get a bad one, and it is just another headache you have to deal with.

If you don't plan on playing any games that require quick reaction time, then I guess this TV would be good.Edit: Here's how I know it's the TV:I had an NES hooked up via composite, the 360 and computer were hooked to different HDMI ports (the 360 was direct HDMI, the computer was DVI -> HDMI adapter).  All devices had input lag hooked to this TV, and didn't have input lag when hooked to my other TVs.Subjectively, the composite seemed to lag the worst. I ran an objective test on the computer. I hooked up a second monitor as a control, cloned them, and ran a timer display. I then took a photo with both monitors in focus to compare the times displayed.
