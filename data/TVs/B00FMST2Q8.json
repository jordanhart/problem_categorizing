The picture is beautiful, the refresh rate is smooth, and the smart features/apps are on par with other manufacturers offerings. The downside is definitely the limited supply of inputs and outputs; it only has 2 HDMI, 1 Component, 1 stereo mini jack output (see edit), 1 digital audio output, and 1 USB port. See my product for pictures for a shot of the inputs.*** EDIT ***After taking another look at the back of my panel, I noticed that contrary to the specs sheet on the Samsung website, mine does indeed have a digital optical audio jack. You can take a look at my product images to compare the back panel and the model number to the one in the listing. It is the same (UN60FH6200FXZA).************This isn't meant to be a comprehensive review, but I'll offer some of my observations from the last week of ownership.For those interested, you can view the full product specs here: [...]Picture Quality:Absolutely gorgeous. Nice and crisp with brilliant color and decent viewing angles. The couches in my living room are arranged in an \"L\" shape with the closest seat 4 feet away just to the right and the furthest 10 feet away just to the left. I do not notice any change in picture quality moving around the room and the 10 foot position seems to be the optimal distance for me when playing games.The TV features 1080p and a 120hz refresh rate, which Samsung seems to use (possibly dishonest) magic math to morph into what they call a 240 \"clear motion rate\". CMR is a metric they advertise as factoring together the refresh rate, processor speed, and backlight technology. No, this TV doesn't have a 240hz refresh rate as some ads state, but the 120hz rate is very good and in my opinion it's at least as decent as the 240hz rate that other entry-level manufacturers achieve with backlight strobing rather than actual processing.Out of the box this TV does lean heavily on Samsung's \"Auto Motion Plus\" processing, which uses digital processing to smooth out the blur and jitter common on LED TV's at this size range. I'll be honest and say that while it does make some scenes look better, it can be a bit jarring and maybe even nauseating in certain circumstances. I've heard people refer to the visual appearance as a \"soap opera effect\". Luckily, the intensity can be tweaked pretty extensively through the menus, or disabled altogether as I have done. On the topic of processing, the TV does feature a \"Game Mode\" which turns off nearly all processing on the image in order to reduce input lag and on-screen noise/artifacts. I highly recommend using this setting with any high definition video game console.The picture tuning options in the menus are very extensive with both pre-programmed and custom settings available. If you're a savvy person and spend a bit of time with it, it's likely you'll be able to tune the picture to your liking.Sound:This model uses an older chassis than most of the Samsungs you will see on the wall at a big box store. It is significantly thicker than the chassis on the 2013 models but not offensively so. The upshot here is that the speakers sound a little better on this model than on the newest ones, presumably owing to the increased airspace around them. I have a moderately-sized living room, and the comfortable listening volume seems to be around 30% of the max.Smart Features:This model uses the 2012 Samsung Smart Hub rather than the flashy 2013 one available on the newer dual-core models. It has most of the apps you would need including a full web browser. I have Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant Video, Pandora, Amazon Cloud Player, Vimeo, Vevo, and Vudu installed. There are several others available in the store including Facebook and Twitter. Overall the Smart Hub is responsive and a lot more attractive than what you'd find on most sub-$1000 smart TVs but not quite as nice as what you'd find on the newest sets in the higher price ranges.Disclosure: I did not purchase the TV from Amazon, but I did purchase this exact model from a big box store.

Cowen", "ReviewID": "R3T5IR8R603GRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class. I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. This TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 3 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of this TV:With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheep TV", "Author": "D.

My requirements were:- 60 inch (58 inch is acceptable, but nothing less)- SmartTV was not mandatory (I would buy a Roku if necessary)- 2+ HDMI ports was mandatory, more is better but only to a certain price point (an external HDMI switch isn't all that expensive)- Picture quality is very important- Reliability is most important (I don't plan to do this again for 5 years)- 120Hz refresh frequency was mandatory, 240Hz would be great but probably not available in my price rangeA couple things I learned:- There's no company that has perfect customer service - people love or hate every manufacturer out there, so you will see lots of negative comments no matter who it is (conclusion: Samsung had a higher number of positive and fewer number of negative based on Amazon, BestBuy, B&H;, etc.)- After looking in several sports bars, Samsung seemed to be the most common (conclusion: sports bars run their TVs a lot more than I do, seemed like a good indicator of reliability)- No thin HDTV in this price range (maybe even higher price ranges) has good speakers (conclusion: you need an external speaker system if you want good sound)- Nearly every HDTV I looked at required some tweaking of picture settings to dial in the right look (conclusion: what you see in the store and what you see at home can/will differ)- As of today, there are only a few sub-$1000 options (e.g. Sharp 650U, Samsung 6003, Sanyo 58\", etc.)The Sanyo 58\" (from Walmart) was considered, but I wasn't thrilled about the sound output connector (remember, external speakers are a must) and I couldn't find a store near me that displayed it. It's unclear how Sanyo's quality would stand up.The Sharp 650U was my next choice, it had all of the features I wanted. However, I've owned some Sharp electronics years ago and they were only so-so on reliability. I wasn't sure that I wanted to risk it.I finally decided to go with a Samsung, the next question was...which model?The 6003 was the least expensive, but lacked sound output (come on Samsung...really?). For this to work, I'd have to buy a receiver for the external speakers.For only $100 more, I could get the 6200 (still cheaper than buying a receiver), which was a model that they released for the 2013 Black Friday shopping season.For another $200, I could get the 6300, which came with 4 HDMI ports (vs. 2 with the 6003 and 6200). At this point I don't need the extra HDMI ports (although, they are nice to have), but I decided that an HDMI switch is acceptable and much cheaper than $200.In conclusion, I opted for the Samsung 6200. Once I adjusted the picture settings, the display quality was top notch. I went with a Visio 2.1 speaker system that works well for my room. I still need to get a wall mount (looking at Amazon's options).

Get a Dumb TV Instead!", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R3JOBG04L38YA5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This review addresses the \"Smart TV\" feature.There is plenty of info here on the picture and the rest of the TV functions, so I will only address the part I wish I knew about before buying. The \"Smart\" TV functions (and I use the term lightly).Speed - The Smart Hub is slow. When it is working properly (which is not often, see below) it takes way too long to load the hub, then even longer to load the app I want to use. Once the app is running (like Netflix, for instance) it seems to run fine, but the hub is slow. Also, the button presses are not very responsive. There is latency between button presses and this often causes you to press a button too many times and have to go back a step.GUI Layout - The interface is not laid out very well. It has multiple sections for different types of apps. Unfortunately I do not use most of them and there is no way to delete many of them so I have to wade through the ones I don't like to get to the ones I do.Reliability - I would say the Smart Hub works properly less than 50% of the time. Most of the time is gets hung up on loading the hub and I have to back out and retry it once or twice before it even loads. Then, once I am in the hub I sometimes have to repeat the process when trying to load an app that hangs up. About 10-15% of the time the Hub freezes and I have to turn the whole TV off and then back on to get it to work again, and still other times the entire TV freezes and I have to actually unplug it! Ridiculous!Remote - The remote control has arrow keys that are slightly different in shape, but not different enough to feel which one I am pressing without looking at it. This causes me to sometimes press the wrong one and accidentally back out of the show I was watching.Updating - The Smart Hub has updates constantly. It doesn't update in the background either. It waits until you press the button and then says 'updating' and you have to wait for it to download and then install before you can use it. I have yet to notice a single thing that changed after an update.Overall - The Smart Hub is a marketing thing that may suffice for someone who seldom uses Netflix or other apps but wants it available without extra hardware. It feels like an afterthought and is terribly executed, works less than half the time, and is slow and glitchy when it does work.Conclusion - If you want Smart TV functions and plan to actually use them, do yourself a favor, get a Roku. The Roku 3 is well designed, incredibly fast, very small, takes hardly any power to run and works perfectly every time. Don't spend extra money to get a Smart TV. Get a dumb one and a Roku 3 to go with it.I hope this saves someone some aggravation.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Loved the T.V. didn'y like \"Smart\", Tv", "Author": "Diane Cybulski", "ReviewID": "R22Z5D1PG1LQDZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great picture- But, spent hours and hours trying to set-p the smart T v function!!

This is money I'll never get back, nor derive true enjoyment, nor value from due to the DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG product that I purchased.  After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.  This problem is systemic in all their LCD's and LED's.  Consumer's have complained all over the internet.

This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00!Furthermore, I was informed that the repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....at which point the technician basically stated, \"just buy another TV.\"SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at a rate of 20% per year, and that they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!

The size is more-or-less cool if you want something big and cheap and don't care for audio out, TV speakers, or something called black. I'll only go over the visual fidelity of the set, as most other gripes regarding the displays missing features should already be well known from the specifications list.There are pretty much only two ways to use this thing: In a high-contrast, make your eyes bleed, sort of way; or in a low contrast, I can-see-details-but-there-is-no-such-thing-as-black; your pick. Most of my time was finding a compromise of the two; there is no such thing on this set.I spent hours and hours trying to adjust the screen for accuracy with some various test patterns and a red filter, to no avail. Granted, this set wasn't for me and was for someone with far poorer taste than I posses; I thought they may be fine with it considering what they currently owned and deemed satisfactory. Though I thought it \u2014 genuinely is \u2014 superior to their current display in particular in regards to the abhorrent and offensive ghosting of their current set, it was concluded that a new set should be met with some finer standards; especially for something going to be around for many years.Poor viewing angles, backlight bleed that fills two-thirds of the screen from both right and left, a couple of huge uniformity blotches near the center, and THE WORST GAME MODE I have ever been the victim of witnessing; all were issues that plagued the set. I didn't even get around to finishing the color calibration due to the poor contrast/brightness levels. My visual test devices primarily consisted of a Xbox One and PS4 which I also discovered seem to require different HDMI/DVI RGB ranges from a display itself; Standard for the Xbox and Non-standard for the PS4. That also caused much confusion as I was thinking the in-console visual options were to blame for the difference in contrast between the two consoles. I had access to two blu-ray copies of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows \u2014 didn't actually watch it but it looked like a terrible film btw \u2014 and so used them and a few similar scenes to switch between and aid in calibrating. After discovering the HDMI/DVI RGB range issue, I was able to get indistinguishable video output from both consoles. I later tested this on my own display and found it to be consistent with my earlier findings.For reference my personal display preferences are fairly high: A Dell U2711 is my main computer and gaming monitor while my Panasonic P60ST60 is my living room theater experience. Both are calibrated quite well; the Dell, factory calibrated with two calibrated color settings, and the Panasonic inheriting some of the THX integrity and spirit from it's cousins abroad as well as it's ancestors and bigger brothers, minus the actual cost and procedure of being THX certified. So, I'm a person who knows and likes their blacks like their coffee; deep and rich.If you are looking for a large screen on a dime and have poor or no taste; you might be inclined to check this one out.If you have about a grand to spend and want some bang for the buck and really terrific visual fidelity, I would tell you to go out and check out a Panasonic P50ST60 which can be had for even less than this monstrosity and with colors and levels that are finger-licking-good.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,147.72", "Features": "1080p HDTV : Better picture quality\n120Hz Refresh Rate: Better for general viewing and good for video games, action movies, and sports\nSmart TV: Interact with streaming content and the web\nTV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 54.1 X 31.5 X 3.7 Inches, TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 54.1 X 33.9 X 12.9 Inches", "Name": "Samsung UN60FH6200FXZA 60-Inch 120 Hz 1080p LED Smart HDTV (Black) (2013 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31XtutbhC6L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FMST2Q8"}}
