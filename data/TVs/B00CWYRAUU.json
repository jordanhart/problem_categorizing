There were not many reviews out there since this tv is new, but I'll give you my two cents.Pros:Picture ControlQuality of Movies & TV Programs3 HDMI'sSmart TV EnabledLEDSlimWeightPriceSmart ShareCons:No VGANo RCA Audio OutputBuilt in SpeakersFor 899, I would recommend the tv. The quality of the picture, smart functions/features, and size is a bargain. Although sound quality was poor, is not a big concern mainly because every TV has poor audio quality (in my opinion, exept 4k's). My biggest concern was picture quality, and at 120 hrz the picture look great. Depending on your service provider your tv may stream 1080i or 720p. I think Direct TV streams 10801, but I have Uverse and they stream 720p. I was worried about the quality, but it looks great. You will have to manipulate the picture settings to your preference, but the Picture Wizard is very helpful in achieving that. Also, a big + is that this tv was smart share so you can connect a home server to the tv (very awesome if u ask me) If you are not picky about rca output, built in audio, and vga - go for it.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV Once Adjusted", "Author": "Mr. President", "ReviewID": "R2DOAKN0I10235", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great TV for the price once you adjust a few things. Sound is the only drawback, sounds a bit tinny. The BIG thing I discovered and I was about to return the TV before I found the remedy is the positively awful Tru Motion. With it on movies look fake  and unnatural, almost like too much detail in the actors. With it OFF movies look like they should. I think this has something to do with judder. The setting is under picture options, tru motion (it comes set on smooth by default).Pros:- Sharp picture, great colors- Nicely packaged- Great  and easy to control menus- Easy setupCons:- Poor sound, but not a dealbreaker- Tru Motion kills the look of movies.. TURN IT OFF!- Letterbox format trims movie size too much- Shiny plastic base could be better designed... matte, textured plastic and should be sturdier, has a bit of wobble", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the money", "Author": "jbtrue", "ReviewID": "R3EH9GVB70JRAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Excellent picture, great apps.Cons: Can't use speakers and optical out at the same time( only for certain hearing aid users).Overall a great tv, Sports look fantastic!", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Picture, But Buggy Software and Terrible Customer Support", "Author": "glembke", "ReviewID": "R3VQNJS5XA8PW0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV 2 weeks ago and was very happy with its performance.
