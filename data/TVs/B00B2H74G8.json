Disclaimer: This is the first flat screen, HDTV I have ever owned, so anything was going to be better than what I had previously. That being said, I have few complaints. I now wish I had at least one more HDMI input, but that was info I had upfront, and part of the trade-off for going for this model.The picture is just fine. Sometimes the picture settings revert back to a previous setting, but once I switch it to the correct setting, the picture is great. I also watch sometimes in moderate lighting during the day, and the picture is still fine. Even when I'm in the kitchen I can still see what's happening in soccer games, and the viewing angle is sharp.If you like the price, and are okay with the inputs and lack of all the bells and whistles, then I recommend it.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not very reliable", "Author": "Statalyzer", "ReviewID": "R5RU2QZGZIVSX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The thing just broke the other day, after I've had it about a year and a half.  It won't accept remote control input (verified problem was with the set, not the remote) and in addition the on/off button now turns it off and immediately back on again from one press, so we had to unplug and plug in the set to turn it on and off.  Lasts just long enough to get past the warranty and then you're screwed....", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected", "Author": "Jamazon", "ReviewID": "R3VMYRIHX725HE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV at a retail store and unfortunately had to return it a week later. Despite several attempts I could not get the colors right. Skin tones were way off and everyone looked slightly gray. Not a problem when watching \"The Walking Dead\", but not great the rest of the time. The picture was often too dark, even in a dimmly lit room, and noticeably grainy. Apparently once you get used to 1080 you can't go back to 720. The screen was crazy reflective. The remote was too small for a set this size. I've wanted a Panasonic plasma for years but this set was NOT what I was hoping for... I guess you get what you pay for.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$625.00", "Features": "TV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 46.7 X 28.2 X 3.19 Inches, TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 46.7 X 29.9 X 10.5 Inches", "Name": "Panasonic TC-P50X60 50-Inch 720p 600Hz Plasma HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41n%2BHPJ8aUL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B2H74G8"}}
