Obviously, this review is for the television itself, and I can't speak to whether the refurbished units are fine. Still, I hope that this review is helpful for those who are just thinking about whether this brand will work well for them.  I've compared it with the other top brand televisions and, as far as I can tell, for the small family this is about as good as it gets (and certainly as good as it needs to be).  I can't imagine why anyone would need a more expensive television, with more features than this one, unless they just need a bigger television for a bigger room.You can plug in hdmi, s-video, component video and audio, cable antennae; you can get signals from dvd and blu-ray players, game systems, camcorders, etc., and hook up surround sound devices for an excellent home movie experience. It's easy to switch between devices using the remote provided (or a universal remote).  We get cable, including several HD stations, and have an upconverting dvd player, and a Wii; occasionally I'll watch what I've recorded on my HD camcorder, through an hdmi cable.You can take off the stand to mount this on a wall.  We have it sitting on top of a small and short but sturdy table, and it stands quite well and solidly.I've been very impressed by the quality of the video - especially with HD content at the full 1080p - and the sound by itself is quite satisfactory for our small living room.  We chose Sanyo because several people had told us that they stand by their televisions, and create no problems with returning defective units.  Luckily, we've had no problems whatsoever in 6 months, but I'm glad to know we'll be covered if we do have problems.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "quite satisfied", "Author": "B. baysinger", "ReviewID": "R1RXKND5EU37MP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "we previously owned a polaroid 36 inch HD LCD 1080p that we paid $1000 for. it only lasted us 5 years, and in that time we had to have it serviced twice while it was still under warranty. this last time it just completely lost all power and we decidede to replace it rather than paying to fix it. this Sanyo was not our 1st choice but out of the 3 TV's we picked out at best buy, there were no local stores that had any of them in stock. getting frustrated, we went to Walmart and picked up this sanyo for under $500 ($536 total with tax and extended 3yr warranty).THE GOOD:  compared to our Polaroid, this sanyo is a major upgrade in terms of picture quality! the picture is so bright, crisp and clear, we had no idea what poor quality the picture we got on our old set was, until we turned this one on. I really was amazed at the difference. it is also very light weight compared to our old model. I don't know if that's good or bad in terms of construction, but I'd feel much more inclined to wall mount this model, than i would with our old polaroid. it has 3 HDMI ports, 3 sets of video inputs (the red, yellow and white plugs), which is good, because it allows you to have several devices hooked up to the TV at one time, and I noticed when shopping around that there are very few models that offer that. if you buy a model that only has one set of video inputs you may have to buy a converter box if you want to have gaming systems, surround sound, or dvd players all hooked up at the same time. it also has a computer input, usb port, video and audio output, DVI input and antenna input.  as far as other TV FEATURES: it has dynamic volume which helps maintain smoother volume levels (like when it goes to a comercial that is extremely loud), there is an eco button that has 3 settings so you can minimize or raise the amount of power the TV uses. another feature is pix shape, there are 7 settings you can choose from manually or you can choose auto select and the TV will automatically choose the correct setting based on the format of what you are watching. there is also a \"help\" button on the remote that will help you trouble shoot various topics, which I found really cool. the menu screen is fairly easy to use, and it has several short cut/ default settings you can choose if you have trouble manually settting your preferences. there is a handy closed caption button on the remote(rather than having to go into your settings menu). there are also other typical features such as channel recall and sleep button.THE BAD:  the sound quality is not spectacular. we usually mute the TV and run the sound through a home theatere system, but if you don't have that option don't expect anything fantastic in terms of sound. If you do have home theatre, there is also no fiberoptic output on this model, but most tivo's and cable boxes have one, so it's not too big of an issue for most people. there is no option to show the time of day on the screen, which isn't a deal breaker but I still wish it had one. finally, the function buttons on the TV itself are not in the most convienient location. they are placed on the underside of the TV which makes it difficult to tell which button you are pushing. I don't understand why they didn't put them right on the front or on the side, as that would have been easier to see and use... but again not a deal breaker.all in all I think this is a great TV and we have been very Happy with it so far. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the sub-par sound quality and the placement of functional buttons on the TV, but still an excellent choice for the price!A Few tips to consider before you buy a TV:  1. it's a bad idea to buy TV's off the internet. while there are many internet beusinesses that can stock various models  of tv's, they may not be an actual \"licenced dealer\" which can make your warrenty null and void. if you are going to buy  via internet, make sure you do so thru a national chain such as KMart, walmart or best buy.  2. TV's are not built to last 20 years like they used to be. the average LCD tv has a life of about 65,000 to 100,000  viewing hours.  3. NEVER buy a floor model!!!! think about it, if that tv was hanging on a wall for 6 months (which is the average) and  was up and running 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, that adds up to alot of hours off the life of your TV  4. Plasma TV's are more prone to image burn and reflect even the smallest amount of light  5. a service repair man once told me that the brand they sevice the least is panasonic, the brand they sevice the most  emmerson, so if a panasonic is in your price range, it may be one of your better bets in terms of minimal  likelyhood to need repairs.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "NEVER BUY A SANYO", "Author": "jesustheclown", "ReviewID": "R2906WVLGGVXF0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Almost ON the expiration date of this products warranty it started having issues... blotches on the screen, lines running down the screen.  I dealt with this piece of crap for the next 3 years with its blotches fading away at times... then coming right back.  I had already assumed this ripoff tv was dead but it stayed alive.  It started making noises a nice vocal hum... everytime you turned it on.  Actually today the display stopped working completely.  Turn the turd on and it teases you with actual television channel for a second then the display is gone and the audio still works.  Sure I had it for a few years but it was messed up after one year. It was a 46 inch pile of crap not to mention the picture quality was better on a 32 inch Vizio I just gave away when I bought this..
