{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Buy this TV", "Author": "trem0r", "ReviewID": "R2XZTI2FTQ5X18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I bought this TV over the Thanksgiving holiday, so we've had it set up for a couple of weeks now.  Price at purchase was ~$450.  This is my main living room TV and my goal was to find a product under $500 in the 42-46\" range.  Never realized I could get such a nice display at 48\" for this price.  Based on other reviews and research, I figured that the TV would be 'good'.  I had no idea that it would be GREAT.  We took a shot in the dark on TCL, not having been able to see it in person before the purchase.. The free 2 year warranty sealed the deal.Aesthetics:Excellent!  The bezel on this tv is ultra thin - much thinner than comparable models of the same size.  When the TV is on, I hardly notice that there is even a frame around the screen.  It's a really nice touch, especially when you compare it to a Vizio with their gigantic angular bezel.  It comes with a heavy glass base (which was unexpected) and makes the TV very sturdy standing.  Even LG and other more popular brands in this price range have flimsy plastic stands.  Nice touch, TCL.  The remote that comes with it is average..nothing special, but not lacking.Settings/Options:This TV is not internet/app capable which is exactly what I wanted.  I have it hooked up to a HTPC which does all of the streaming/recording that I need it to.  Personally, I feel like internet capable TVs are overrated. Most of them are more pricey than they're worth, especially if you can set up a nice HTPC to do those types of things for you.  With that said, the picture options are basic (color, tint, brightness, contrast, backlight, sharpness, etc) but I found them to be more than adequate to get the look I wanted.  I'm also impressed at how bright this TV can get - it can get much brighter than some of the other models that I compared it with, so bright I actually had to dim it considerably.Inputs:There aren't a whole lot of inputs on this TV, but as an average TV user, I don't really need them.  If you're going to hook up more than a couple of HDMI devices, I'd suggest getting an HDMI switch.  For me, 2 is enough since everything is routed via the HTPC.Sound:Some of the other reviewers here have stated that the sound quality is less than expected, and I agree.  I do not have my TV hooked up to any kind of sound system, surround or otherwise, and I found the sound to be slightly lacking.  It has plenty of volume and I usually have it at around level 20 out of 100 in normal situations, but it does sound a little hollow and without much bass.  There are various sound presets, and after some tweaking, I managed to find a sweet spot that is acceptable to me.  After listening to it for 15 minutes or so, I got completely used to it.  If you're an audiophile, you might want to consider a sound bar or some alternative speaker set up.Video/Picture:I am extraordinarily impressed with the picture quality that is coming out of this $450 TV.  I dare say that it rivals TVs in the ~$800 - $1k price range.  My dad has a 46\" Samsung 1080p 120hz LCD, and my wife's grandmother just bought a brand new LG 47\" 1080p 120hz.  This display beats the LG hands down in terms of clarity, sharpness, motion blur, contrast, etc.  I would say that this display is on par, and even slightly better than the Samsung in those same categories.  Granted, my dad's Samsung is a couple of years old, but I personally haven't seen a better display under $1k until now (even in store).Black levels are excellent, whites are bright.  Sports are crisp and without blur.  My cable box allows me to switch between 720p and 1080i broadcasts, and I've experimented with both.  Even though 1080i is a better resolution than 720p, the broadcast is interlaced (instead of progressive) and some TV's have a problem deinterlacing a 1080i stream - not this display.  Occasionally, there are some artifacts @ 1080i (not p) but unless you're 'really trying' to scrutinize, it's not worth mentioning.  Of course, blu-ray is 1080p, not i. If you don't know the difference between 1080i, 1080p, and 720p, I'd suggest reading up on those. Television broadcasts are NOT 1080p.  I'm extremely impressed with the deinterlacing processor on this display, and have left my cable box setting @ 1080i simply for the higher resolution.  It might be noteworthy to mention that if you have HD cable service, not all boxes default to 1080i.  Mine, by default, transmitted 720p.  Some of you might not even notice the difference.Other thoughts:- I did a lot of research before I bought this display.  I read all the reviews here on Amazon, and other places.  I also did some corporate research on TCL and found that they have a contract with Samsung, so I believe that the newer TCL models use Samsung screens.  I am not 100% on this, but it makes a lot of sense now that I have the TV - Samsung makes great displays, and I honestly believe that this particular display is on par in terms of quality with Samsung.- Some reviewers mention that the TV packaging was messed up during shipping.  Mine was not.  Nothing wrong with the packaging inside or out.  No scratches or blemishes whatsoever.- If you know what you want going into a purchase like this, I'd highly urge you to give TCL a shot.  Again, only two HDMI inputs, no internet capability.  I gave this TV 5 stars based on video/display quality alone.  All my wife and I really wanted was a tv that LOOKED GOOD to watch.  At ~$500, this is a steal.- Lastly, I'll have you all know that this is one of my very first reviews on *any* product.  I read reviews on products all the time, but never end up contributing.  It took a lot of time for my wife and I to narrow down our selection, especially when you consider that asking for a 42-46\" 1080p 120hz for under $500 is VERY hard to come by.  I felt compelled to give this display a darn good review, because I'm darn impressed.  If you choose to drop the coin on this TCL, I hope that you have as good of an experience as I have had.Peace.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV with high quality", "Author": "amazonuserx \"amazonuserx\"", "ReviewID": "RGTEKK9RYLSI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my TV three days ago.

Love it!", "Author": "J. Sanctus-Filius \"Johannes\"", "ReviewID": "R308L2DYIKS6U4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this TV today a couple of hours ago.First, the obvious.  At this price, it is an amazing deal! I'm glad to have found a TV brand that decided to sell a TV with a great picture and very little else.  I already have an HTPC with blu-ray, wifi SD car reader, etc, and with an HDMI connector.  Why would I want to spend extra money on redundant gizmos on the TV itself?The TV has great aesthetics and looks very elegant with its thin bezel and glass base.  It is no Sony or Samsung ultra thin but it is quite good-looking.Now to the picture and sound.  The usual brightness, contrast, hue saturation adjustments are there but, very thoughtfully, somebody had presets built in such as natural, movies, and others.  That's very convenient.  The same can be said about the sound settings with an equalizer and presets for movies, regular, music, etc. It's nice to be able to set up the sound quickly if one is not watching a movie with the external sound system.  I had no problems with the quality of the built in speakers.I hooked up my antenna (I don't pay cable since I have my HTPC streaming lots of stuff) and the HD programming looked fantastic.  I then watched a number of videos stored in my PC; 1920x1080, 1280x720, 720x576 640x480.  Everything looked as good as the source allowed.  The \"creation of the world\" segment from the \"Tree of Life\" was as spectacular as it was meant to be.I am very pleased with this TV. The quality is very good, period, but at this price it is remarkable.N.B.As to the packaging, it almost gave me a heart attack! The box is standard box for TV packaging. However when the box was moved before opening it, the sound of broken glass could be heard!  Needless to say that was very disturbing.  As it turned out, the sound was being made by screws and a metal plate packaged loosely inside a plastic bag. Instead of being tightly held by the styrofoam packaging  as with other TVs that I've bought, this bag was just bouncing around in a space inside the box. Nothing was damaged but that noise was heart stopping.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best value.

No bells and whistles, just good picture and solid build.I had a Panasonic LED TV and I suspect that the TCL uses a Panasonic Alpha IPS panel.  The picture quality looks kinda similar and the view angle is very wide.Picture quality, especially color vibrancy, is not as good as mid-range Samsung or Sony, but those cost $1200 or more for a 55 inch model.  Among second- and third-tier LCD manufacturers (Toshiba, Vizio, etc) there is no match.I do not care about smart TV because I hooked my TV to a blur-ray player and my computer.  Or about connectivity.  If you have a receiver or a soundbar with HDMI switching, all you need is to connect the TV to the soundbar/receiver with a single HDMI cable.So, unless you are very picky about picture quality and bells and whistles, I would highly recommend this TCL TV.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent tv!", "Author": "LoveLife", "ReviewID": "R1NYX2RL6ZQS0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I bought this tv on amazon, I felt like I was taking a gamble cuz a) it is not a brand name b) the other reviews where others have said theirs was broken.

WOW.", "Author": "Tim Wachter", "ReviewID": "RQP0NFNOZW8V8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "we've been looking for a 40+\" tv for a year. my only prereq's were: full 1080p, at least 120hz, must not cost an entire paycheck, and must knock my socks off. it took me a year of searching before i decided to pull the trigger on something. in short, this tcl 48\" wins hands down. now, for the long review...first, the shipping. it took me two tries to get an intact delivery. the first one arrived, in only one day with free prime shipping, but with two giant holes in the side of the box. i pulled the tv out, and it had a big gouge in the screen and the lcd panel was cracked and bleeding out. i refused the delivery and immediately called amazon, and within 10 minutes of phone time, they had processed my replacement order at zero cost to me. the second tv arrived two days later, and in perfect shape. kudos, amazon customer service!now, the tv. i was afraid that a 48\" tv would be too big for the space i had made for it on my wall. however, so little real estate is taken up by the thin bezel that the tv's physical dimensions are comparable to an lcd that only has a 46\" screen. that little extra wiggle room made all the difference.the only other hdtv we own is a 23\" led for the bedroom, and we had an old 32\" sd tube tv in the living room before this purchase, so i don't have the ability to compare this tv's picture to some other big screen hd model. having said that, i am absolutely blown away with the viewing experience on this tv! i tweaked the preset controls for a few minutes before queueing up \"batman: tdk rises\" in 1080p (we simply had to go out and get something stunning for our first viewing experience). this is where that WOW comes into play.i'm no expert on 60/120/240 refresh technical details, but i'm not a novice either, and i do know when i see judder and soap-opera effect. i have to say, i didn't notice either. all the people complaining in the reviews about this tv being 60hz only, they fail to understand that what the tv is telling you on the display is the input stream quality, not the output to the lcd. almost no input signal is going to go higher than 1080p60hz right now. the tv takes care of the rest. and this particular tv takes care of the rest very well. from the high-action scenes to the sweeping slow pans across vast landscapes, my eyes never told my brain anything besides \"this is awesome!\" nothing about pixels or refresh rates crossed my mind. and that's the point, right?a couple other things. the remote has received a bad rap for some reason. first, have you seen the standard remotes that come with most electronics these days? they're all cheap, plastic, and basic. that's what you get with a free remote nowadays. at least this one takes AAA batteries instead of buttons. the real question is: does it give you access to all the functions in the tv? the answer is yes. if you're concerned about controlling all your devices with one remote, get a harmony.also, the glass base stand. i never used it, as the tv went right onto the wall, but the base appears to be very sturdy. i'm sure it would be more than adequate to hold this relatively light tv securely on a sturdy surface.the ac cord is hard-wired into the tv and cannot be removed, which i was not entirely happy about, but oh well.there's also just a tiny bit of light that leaks out through a bottom vent on the tv and onto the wall behind it. i've only noticed it once, when i had all the lights off in the room with the tv turned on, and only when the giant tv wasn't blowing my mind with stunning video. it's not a bother to me, but it could easily be fixed with a bit of black electrical tape.i already have an older surround sound stereo system that i hooked the tv up to right away, so i can't comment on the sound quality too much. i did test the built-in speakers out to make sure they worked, and they were the typical-sounding flat panel speakers: tinny, thin, and weak. no surprise there.to anyone scared by the brand name on this tv, i can't convince you that your tcl won't fail after a few months. you will have to rely on the reviews of others who have had it longer than myself, and the provided 2-yr warranty. if it does fail, i will update this review accordingly.i bought this tv for $479. i also signed up for the amazon rewards visa, which included a $50 credit. that $50 covered the mounting bracket, low-voltage wall plates for running a/v cables behind the wall, and a recessed wall receptacle to power the tv without showing any cords. i'm tech- and construction-savvy enough to install the whole setup comfortably by myself. in the end, i walked away with a professional-looking install on a tv that looks like it could have cost well over $1000, all for less than 500 bucks.tl;dr-if you're even halfways considering getting this tv, do yourself a favor and just buy it. after a year of searching, i don't think i could have done any better.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice TV but doesn't work!

It was next to a Samsung 6100 series. I could tell the Samsung at a slightly better picture (more natural, but knowing have TV mfgr's set their TV's for display can account for a difference). I next headed to Best Buy where they do not carry TCL. They had a 47\" LG LED-LCD on sale for $599. I was itching to buy SOMETHING, so I did. I thought it had a sharp picture and a thin bezel and panel. Took it home and felt it was just too small. It didn't fit the spot left by my 50\" Samsung Plasma. So I went online and started looking for Cyber Monday Deals, saw this beauty on Amazon. Being impressed from the smaller model at Samsung, I figure with free shipping no tax, the barely higher price was a steal for a 55\". Received the TV yesterday, and let me say, BUY THIS TV. I set it up next to my LG to compare, my friend came over to check it out, we played with settings and both agreed it had deeper blacks, brighter whites, and a sharper image. The refresh rate is great, not quite on par with the Samsung 6100 series but for HALF the price, how can you compare? Then comes looks, I was concerned it might not be as visually pleasing as the LG or Samsung when turned off. Well rest assured it's a beauty. The bezel is as thin as my pinky and slightly THINNER than the LG. The TV is slightly thicker than the LG, but that is expected when its a BACKLIT-LED LCD vs an EDGE-LIT-LED-LCD. It is still very thin, but the better blacks and whites from back-lit is totally worth the thickness. The remote is cheap, but so are all TV remotes, unless you buy a smart TV. If you want a great picture and no frills, this is the absolute best option out there for a 55\". Only issue I have is no optical audio out. $15 converter will fix that.

It has a nice slim bezel, fantastic picture, and easy to use controls. A lot of the reviews say the sound isn't great but I think it is pretty decent. Certainly not a surround sound system, but its better than my old TV and projects it quite well. It has a good selection of connections.

We have been watching TV, sports, movies, and kids shows on it for about a week and we have no complaints about the TV at all. We love it! I can't confirm but some things I read on the internet says that TCL actually uses Samsung panels in their sets. If so, you are getting good equipment.This isn't about the TV, but the delivery service. This is advertized by Amazon as having the special delivery service where they come in and setup the TV. Not sure what happened there, but I didn't get that service. I got quite the opposite actually. They left a $500 TV right on my front doorstep! Fortunately it was still there when we got home. I selected the free shipping option so maybe that is why. But I didn't see anything to say I wouldn't get that service if I did select it.Also, if you have Verizon's FIOS service you may have some issues with the FIOS universal remote.

Don't expect to get a BMW for the price of a Toyota.TCL: I had never heard of this brand before i seen this TV. I Did the research and found its a top brand in China making its way into the US. TCL sells most of their products in north america under the RCA brand. Samsung had outsourced some of the assembly of their LCDs to TCL in 2008.The TV itself is nice to look at. It has a thin bezel and nice glass base. The base seems nice and sturdy. The remote is basic but works fine. I don't know why people complain so much about the remote. Its basic like the TV and it works fine.PORTS: It only has 2 HDMI but remember this is a $500 TV don't expect it to have a bunch. It does NOT have optical audio ports but the Digital Audio Coax works great and produces good sound quality in my opinion. (Personally i thought it was broken until i remembered that i had to enable the digital coax on my receiver. After i remembered and changed the setting on my receiver it worked great.)Sound: Honestly it sounds like any other HDTV. Its not horrible and it's not great. If you want great then get a sound bar or surround sound and use the Digital coax.Settings: I think it has plenty of settings that you can adjust and play with to get the picture to look just how you like it.Now for picture quality. I have not completed the calibration of the TV yet but it looks pretty good. I think it will look much better after its calibrated. But the colors are bright, whites look good, and the blacks are good and black. I looked at a lot of TVs and none in the $400 to $700 range look as good as this TCL. A few have mentioned that they felt it was not a 240Hz TV because the input said 60Hz. Those reviewers simply don't understand what 240Hz is. The inputs are 60Hz just like all the other HDTVs. The TV converts it to 240Hz. Do some research if you want to know more. I personally do not notice any soap-opera effect or blur that other TVs have. I am sure some videophiles would say it looks horrible but for the average person it looks great.Conclusion. It is a really great deal. The TV looks very good for $500.

Don't get me wrong, CSOT is no joke, at leaset the current largest 4K TV, a 110 incher, is made by them.CSOT is now also supplying 2.55 million panels to Samsung per year. So more and more Samsung TVs will have the same panels as TCL in the future. Which means CSOT makes quality panels if they can walk into Samsung's door.And as to where did TCL get their panels before they switched over to CSOT, maybe from AO (Taiwan), I'm not sure, but it's not from Samsung according to an article (link in comment). What Samsung has outsourced to TCL, was just some productions of Samsung panels because of lower costs. And TCL is NOT allowed to use those panels. Which it make sense, because Samsung would lose sales to TCL, if TCL can sell TVs carrying a Samsung panels for a much lower price.At the end, I'm loving my new TCL, and worth every penny spent!", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "My TV showed up over my lunch hour", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R1TU58I9OUEHJV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got a call from the freight company that they were 20 min's away from my house.  So I packed up a bit before lunch and drove home to meet them.  First of all,  Both drivers were very considerate, and being a local company, one of the drivers knew my family.  They opened the box, made sure that the TV was not DOA, and both mentioned that with the 7-9 TV deliveries they make per day this time of year, neither had ever heard of TCL.Once I signed all the papers, they left and I hooked up the HDMI line from my HTPC, and started looking at content that had been recorded, and some additional 720 and 1080 content I had on my machine.It Was Amazing!  At 240Hz, the viberant colors and the smoothness of the blacks were stunning!

For the price, this TV simply cannot be beat.  I would actually give it 4.5 stars.I was mostly concerned about the lack of brand recognition/reputation and some of the things mentioned in the negative reviews here on Amazon and other sites.  I'm kind of picky when it comes to TVs, and I own 6 other flat screens (combination of LCD, LED and plasma).  My other TVs are Samsungs and Sonys, so it was a real stretch for me to go with a brand I had barely heard of and only seen at a local Sam's Club.But I was looking for a decent-sized TV for an exercise room that would not break the bank.  A major name brand in the 46 to 50 inch size would set me back at least a couple hundred more than this TCL, and some were more than 2 times the price.  I figured I'd give it a shot because the reviews were mostly positive and the more I watched it at Sam's Club, the more I liked it.Let me say that this TV will not look its best out of the box.  I think the fatal mistake most people make when purchasing a new TV is that they assume it's calibrated to their preferences and all they have to do is plug it in and start watching.  Well, that's not the way it works these days.  Anyway, this TV has lots of ways to make it look better and you either have to experiment and kind of know what you're doing (and know what you like in a TV picture), or calibrate using one of the many calibration tools/discs out there.  Once you do get it calibrated to your liking, the picture is very, very good, especially with high quality HD material.Of course, there are some things that I think could be better, but I'm really nitpicking here, especially when this TV runs less than 5 Benjamins.  First, this is not the thinnest or lightest 48\" TV I have ever seen.  But the thin bezel really makes it appear sleeker than it really is, especially when it's hung on the wall (no one really notices how thick it is or how much it weighs when it's on the wall).Second, the mounting configuration is VESA 200x200 which is generally reserved for smaller TVs (42\" and under).  Although I mounted it using a very good multi-directional OmniMount mount, the 200x200 makes this TV difficult to keep level when you move it around.  Granted, I could have gone with a fixed mount which may have helped, but these days most people are using mounts that move around.  400x400 may be the better VESA pattern for this TV, but again, this is not any kind of dealbreaker (200x200 mounts are cheaper and sleeker looking and most can handle the heft of this TV, keeping it level is the issue, and by level I mean perfectly level, it's not like this thing tilts at 45 degrees or anything).Third, the \"240hz\" refresh rate is a little deceiving.  I have some 60Hz Sony TVs that have much less motion blur than this TCL.  Don't get turned off by this though.  The motion blur is not that bad, but it is noticeable in fast moving sporting events when compared to other TVs.  If you are going to be watching a lot of hockey or other fast-moving sporting events, you may want to pick a different TV.  For all other content, I think this TV does a fine job.Finally, and I don't think this is that big of a deal, but it only has 2 HDMI inputs.  I hooked mine up to a DirecTV receiver and a wifi enabled Sony Blu-Ray player, which is all I needed for my situation.  If you want to hook up more gear, you will need to either get a decent home theater receiver or an HDMI switcher.My TV did not have any dead pixels or green lines as others have complained of.  I also do not think the speakers in this TV are as bad as some have complained of.  Most flat panel TVs have crappy speakers due to lack of space.  Get a sound bar or hook it up to a home theater if the built-in speakers are a problem for you.  I have some wireless headphones that work well, especially when using the treadmill, so that's an option too.I have not had the unit that long (only a couple weeks) but have watched both SD and HD satellite content as well as Blu-Ray material.  I can honestly say that when you are watching something in HD from a quality source through HDMI, the picture is great.  I have no regrets about purchasing this unit thus far and can only hope it continues to perform the way it has because it's absolutely perfect for what I use it for.

I, like many others who have reviewed this product, was quite hesitant about the TV's quality simply because TCL is probably the most \"off\" of the \"off-brand\" TV's out there. Despite this, this TCL TV is arguably just as good as any brand-name TV of an equivalent type.To give everyone a little context from the TV we replaced, here it is -VIZIO M370NV 37-Inch 1080p LED LCD HDTV with Razor LED Backlighting, BlackIt can be hard to quantify what one person's definition of \"amazing picture\" is as who knows what they're comparing it too. Our last TV, in essence, was quite good overall. Hopefully that helps.Pros:- TV picture quality is very impressive - Back-light is quite bright, images are impressively sharp due to pixel count, and the colors are even more lush that our last TV.- Very wide viewing angle.- Setup is simple.- Doesn't have any sort of high refresh rate issues like \"halo-ing\" (the weird pixel blur during fast motion scenes that happen sometimes with non-60hz TV's [and sometimes 60hz TV's])- The TV features a picture \"quick switch\" feature that allows you to simply hit the button and changes the picture mode from \"Sports\" to \"Natural\" or \"Game\",etc.- Comes with a 2 year warranty.- Menu is better than the one on our old Vizio as it has a few more customization features (nothing huge, though).- Minimal frame around the TV looks quite nice.- TV's overall design is nice looking and simple.- The TV has the ability to swivel the screen if need be (at least ours does).- An insanely low price for the quality.Cons- The first TV that was sent to us had some dead pixels on it. I don't believe, though, that this was related to this TV being from some off-brand name but instead the fact that dead pixels happen on most TV brands because...well...they do. Despite this, TCL and Amazon quickly replaced the TV's (old TV shipped out the next day no cost to us and the replacement came the following day). So this is a kind of bad thing. It sucks to have happen but dead pixels are hardly limited to a certain brand.Notable Things - This is just anything that I don't considered good or bad but someone else may care about.- The menu isn't anything that flashy. It does the job of the menu and nothing more.- The remote feels a little cheap if that's something you care about.- The TV takes a bit longer than our old Vizio to power-on or switch between input devices (9 seconds instead of like 6).- Only 2 HDMI ports (although that's more common now a days anyway...also easily worked around if need be).- If you haven't noticed by now, it doesn't have any 3D or \"Smart\" TV abilities. However, you probably wouldn't be here if you wanted those things anyway. Our PS3 takes care of the whole \"smart TV\" aspect and you can always purchase a $50 Smart TV USB device if you really want one and plug it into this TV's USB port (most blu-ray players feature SMART TV-like features as well).Overall, this TV is quite impressive especially considering how cheap it is. Like many of you, I too was hesitant at first when purchasing this TV just due to not knowing the company. While I can't speak for their whole line of products, this 48\" TCL LED 240hz TV (and likely it's 55\" equivalent) are great quality for the price. If you want a high quality image for a good price and don't care about frivolous things like 3D or Smart capabilities I highly recommend this TV. I know it's kind of scary buying an off brand name, but just a few years ago Vizio was an off-brand too. Worst comes to worst, you don't like it (or get a few dead pixels) all you have to do is send it back (which Amazon makes incredibly easy and quick).", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantasic Deal", "Author": "Old Jedi", "ReviewID": "RS8UBFR00ERFZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hard to believe !!

The only time you will need anything past 60hz is when watching Blue Ray.  Even the Xbox 360 and PS3 max out at 60hz.

The reviews were mixed about 60% negative and 40% positive. Many of the reviewers claimed that their sets arrived damaged or that they had a green screen. Many had not heard of TCL and were reluctant to purchase an off brand name. After spending many sleekness nights trying to decide if I should get this tv verses a known name brand set for more money, I went with TCL. After owning the tv for over a week now I have the following to say:The tv arrived safely with no damage. The delivery service was scheduled to deliver between 8am and 12pm and unfortunately we were the last stop. It was Amazon white glove delivery service which means that they carried it into the house, unpacked it, put The base on it, plugged it in to verify it had power, and offered to take away the trash. All I had to do was plug in my HDMI cables and adjust the picture settings!The glass base for this tv is very attractive and looks very high end.Sure the speakers sound a bit \"tinny\" but I just connected my home theatre system using the headphone out jack on the back of the tv and now the sound is awesome! I read about other users having to buy digital out converter boxes to connect their audio systems, but I simply worked around it using the headphone jack instead.Some complained that the tv has no wifi capability, or 3D, or  Internet apps. So what! I have Directv which has Internet capability and apps. I can also stream movies from my computer to the tv through the Directv receiver. Problem solved.No lag switching channels, the tv takes about 3 or 4 seconds to come on.Also, TCL stands for \"The Creative Life\". They are one of the top tv manufacturers in China and own about 70% of the market share in China. They recently opened an office in the US and are working hard to get their name out there.Blu-Ray movies look absolutely stunning. I found myself watching older movies I had seen before all over again because I could now notice details that were never visible before. I haven't had any issues with clouding and the black levels look good to me.Bottom line is this - don't believe all the negative hype posted here about this tv. I was so paranoid after ordering the tv on amazon that I lost sleep over it until it arrived. I could not be happier with this purchase. Also the price was just right for me.

Most importantly I also didn't want to spend a fortune on one.  I could not find one anywhere until I stumbled upon this 48\" set on Amazon after almost purchasing a 3D LCD 42\" Panasonic set with 4 pairs of 3D glasses on Amazon at a reasonable price of $699.  After comparing the pros and cons of both sets to my personal preference I decided to go for the TCL due to the obvious low price, the 2 yr warranty, the extra inches on the screen and the good reviews on Amazon.  I had a bad past experience purchasing a TV set on Amazon whereas the Samsung LED TV at the time (2008) had dead pixels.  Amazon gave me no hassle returning it since it was well within the 30 day period.  I steered clear of LED's ever since and knew that dead pixels was a common issue.  I then purchased a Samsung 40\" LCD on amazon as well which then failed on me after 4 years.  Now in 2013, I decided to give LED's another shot since technology is always advancing in this competitive market.This TCL set was exactly what I needed and wanted.  It is a much better fit for me than the Samsung I had since I never needed or used the Wi-Fi on the set to connect to the internet or used all 4 HDMI ports.  The sound on the Samsung was ok but needed bass as all flat screen TV's do including this TCL.  I paid a bundle for a brand name and bonuses I never used.  The Samsung LCD did have good display qualities and the soap opera effect was a plus for me but this TCL vibrancy, color saturation and clarity was definitely a step up.  My TCL claims it has a refresh rate of 240hz but from what I've seen on the Samsung this is not the case on this set.  There is absolutely no soap opera effect whatsoever which like others mentioned, leaves the 240hz to be questioned.  It's most likely 60 hz which is why I gave it 4 stars.  Knowing that, I still very much enjoy this set.  I checked TCL's website on this TV and the specs never mention its refresh rate.  There's actually 2 sets with similar model numbers on their website.  The other set is LE48FHDF3300Z which is missing the \"TA\" at the end of this set.  Maybe that model has the 240 refresh rate???  I sent them an email to clarify the differences of both models.As others have listed on their reviews of the cons on this set, it only has 2 HDMI ports, the power cord is not removable, the placement of the coaxial port is cumbersome and again the non-existence of the 240hz refresh rate.  I had to bend the rubber casing on my coaxial cable in order to screw it into the port .  The 2 HDMI ports were sufficient for me.  I added pictures of all the ports on Amazon.  My set came with an oily substance smeared on the glass stand and the panel had a fine scuff mark on the top left corner of the screen which was easily removed.  No real damage was done.  The box arrived slightly beaten during shipping but with all of those minor issues the set made it to my home in one piece and it's working as it should.  The glass stand was easily attached and it came with extra bolts to attach it to a wall mount if needed.  Again, my only con is the missing 240hz to create that \"Soap Opera effect\" that everyone seems to hate.  I really enjoyed that on the Samsung.Since my new screen is larger I made sure to sit at least 8 - 10 feet away from the screen.  After tweaking to my liking the images look outstanding.  The image on screen is the same in any angle I sit in the room.  No loss of color or brightness.  The colors are more vibrant, blacks are very dark compared to my old Samsung and the texts are smooth only if you're not sitting 3 feet in front of the screen and are watching digital channels.  The screen texture is of a semi-matte finish so it is not as reflective as glass.  My settings are listed at the bottom of this review in case anyone wants to try them out.  Please keep in mind these setting are to my liking so do not expect to be just as happy as I am with them.  I am not a professional but thought I'd share them since I was looking for other settings on Amazon myself.  They are set for a medium sized room (10 feet by 20 feet) with very little light from the outside entering the room.  I have not noticed any lag or judder on this set as of yet and I also did not notice any backlight bleeding or halo effects on this back-lit LED after I adjusted my settings.  I'm a perfectionist so I looked for those negatives especially after reading a good amount of bad reviews on here.  I only noticed blurry and choppy video on lower resolution channels which will happen on any set.  While watching digital channels at 1080i (ESPN) and watching Blu-Ray movies (Snow White and the Huntsman) at 1080p on my PS3 I have to say this set is by far the best I've seen even at my local retailers.  I did a lot of research and traveling to stores comparing specs on different brands and models along with the price tags and this set blew those large brand names away especially on the price.  At the ridiculous low price I paid of $469 for this 48\" set along with free shipping, backed by Amazon and the 2 yr limited warranty by TCL I could not resist this opportunity.  I ordered this set at 11am on a Thursday and received it at 3pm on Friday using the \"Super Free Shipping\" option.  I got it in a little over a day and I'm not even a Prime member.  I was mentally prepared for the worst when it arrived and none of my fears came true.  So far, I'm very pleased with my purchase and I recommend this set to anyone not wanting to spend a fortune, not looking for a smart TV and do not care for a refresh rate higher than 60hz.  If anything happens in the future with my set I will update my review.My settings are set under \"Personal\":Brightness - 48Contrast - 70Sharpness- 60Backlight - 55Color - 58Tint - 0Color Temp - 1Light Sensor, Dynamic Backlight and SABC are set to - Off.Noise Reduction - LowKeep in mind that once you're done entering your settings you must press \"Clear\" to save them.  Do not press \"Go Back\" as that will not save the settings.Hope this helps.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING TV for the $$$", "Author": "Sooby Dooby \"This Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R22XQYN9NZD07M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is nothing out there that is going to compare to this tv for the price.  I use it as a second monitor/bedroom tv and it more than suites my needs.  It is hooked to my computer via hdmi, so it is basically a smart(er) tv.  The audio is transmitted via the hdmi as well, so there aren't a bunch of cables running all over the place.  I haven't listened to the built in speakers other than to test that they worked when it arrived, it is not as full of a sound as my 50\" Hitachi but plenty enough for a medium size room, however...  The whole setup is hooked up to a home stereo so I have a full home theater setup in my room (a little excessive for the size of the room but I really like a full experience when I watch movies.)  Watching Hulu/Netflix/Youtube in 1080 etc you would never know you weren't watching a DVD.I cannot comment on what others have said about it not looking like a true 240hz system, as my other tv is only 60hz, but I know it far out performs that unit as far as action sequences/gaming is concerned.As far as using it for a second monitor; I'm an amateur photographer, and 18mp raw/jpegs look amazingly clear and are much easier to edit with this large of a screen.  The only draw back I see there is everything seems a bit too sharp compared to my computer monitor (toshiba lcd) so I pick a happy medium between the two.The only possible con to this tv would be it only has 2 HDMI inputs.  In order to have HD for all my inputs I either have to swap out the XBox for the cable tv or leave the Xbox plugged in the AV inputs @ 480p (which is what I do usually).  I am sure there is a splitter out there that I could buy, but it isn't enough of an issue for me to look into it.Also, with a great energy star rating due to it being LED this thing barely uses any juice and produces veeerrrry little heat, which for a small room is a plus (the computer-stereo combo actually make a difference in my A/C usage in the summer)The styling is modern and the frame is slender and clean in a glossy black.  The TCL logo is very subtle, which is nice for those of us that might care about blatantly advertising their Western Familyesc HDTV.  The black GLASS base is very nice looking, a clean finish to a stylish unit.  I don't like the power light.  It's orange. That's all I'm gonna say about it.Cliff Notes:TCL 48\" 240hz LED = great bang for the buckOwned Unit: 1 monthTech level: I do my research before I buy my toysWould I recommend this unit?

But I want to share my review. We've had the TV for 2 weeks now. The carton and contents were in good shape, no damage. Set up was easy with the exception of the screws securing the screen to the stand were very tight. I was afraid something would snap but nothing did. Programming set up was also easy and quick. There were no fixed or dead pixels. Backlight was smooth and even.So far so good. The picture quality was less than hoped for however. I upgraded my 32\" Samsung to this TCL. After 10 days we were ready to box it up and return it. BUT THEN I upgraded to the HD cable box from Comcast and BAM! The picture is amazing, even on non-HD channels. But the HD is fantastic. (I hadn't gone full HD in the past because the 32\" hadn't shown the signal limitations). Should I have known better, perhaps. But you don't know what you don't know. The color is great. The preset color options are convenient. The sound is better than average. If you want and expect home theater sound get a home theater hook-up. The sound is strong and clear and also has convenient presets. 2 HDMI inputs are enough for me, cable and Blu-Ray. The thin bezel is modern and  attractive. The stand is glass and adds the overall quality feel.I had to use RCA code 10047 to program my Comcast remote but I saw that tip in a review so that was no problem. I was afraid of the unknown TCL brand but don't be. TCL is the 5th largest TV maker in the world and the #2 brand in China, they have been positioning themselves to breakout and compete with the larger manufacturers. Google TCL and do some reading. I would recommend this TV to anyone. We are very happy with the purchase. Did I mention the price was great? If you want to spend $500 more for a TV go ahead. But unless you need a smart or 3D TV, or just have too much money don't bother.Frankly I don't know why I don't give this 5 stars.Recap: great TV, convenient features, good price.

But I did about 2 weeks of research, and decided that the $699 price tag for the 55inch was unbeatable. And it was. Received the TV 2 days after I ordered it and I couldn't be happier.  55in is huge, and the bezel makes it look even bigger.  Just played a bluray last night and it was impeccable. Speakers are obviously a challenge on any flat screen, and I had to adjust the treble down some in order to get rid of tinniness, but now it sounds just fine.  The picture is just what you would expect from any flat screen, and has plenty of adjustments to make it perfect for your taste.  Maybe it looks a little off sometimes, but I also think that being 55inches, it is easier to pick up imperfections from live broadcasts and other broadcasts over cable. Like I said, bluray and video games looks perfect. Sports look great, too.  If i had paid $1,000 or $1,200 for a name-brand TV, I'd probably be saying 4 stars, but because I paid 700 for this much TV and I've had it now for a week, I can tell you it's definitely a 5 star.

I was extremely hesitant in buying a 240HZ television, as it tends to give non-sports programming a \"handycam\" feel.Thoughts so far:Pros:--The picture is remarkably sharp, and the colors are vibrant and bright. The amount of inputs are refreshing, and rare to find on the more modern digital sets, such as analog audio out. As someone with an older receiver, this was critical. It should be noted that the audio out is a headphone jack (along with several digital audio outs), and not the standard RCA cables, so plan on needing a headphone to rca converter (which I happened to have).--It has awesome features like auto brightness sensing (adjusts to the brightness of the room, though it tends to be on the bright side), and my favorite--VOLUME SMOOTHING! No more loud TV commercials!Cons:--THIS SCREEN IS NOT 240HZ. I'm fine with that, as 240 looks strange--but if that's what you're looking for you'll be disappointed. My excellent video card detects refresh rates of 40, 59, and 60HZ. Sports programming is most definitely received at a standard 60hz.--The contrast ratio is nothing to write home about. There are noticeable light areas in dark scenes where the back-light bleeds through, and although much more slight--dark areas on a white screen. This isn't a deal-breaker, as a less-obsessive person would probably not even notice...but I mention it for the sake of the concerned buyer.-The Coaxial antenna ports are in a terrible spot and prove quite difficult to screw in. Count on some obscenities being shouted at it while you hook the TV up.All in all, the positives definitely outweigh the negatives on this TCL 48in 240hz (hah...) television.

My boyfriend is better at this stuff, so after I spent countless hours comparing TVs in Target, Wal-Mart and PC Richards, (and even securing a pre-order for a Coby, [which I quickly cancelled after hearing bad things]), I told him to see what he could find on Amazon.  He found this TV and after sorting out what could be \"insider reviews\" from genuine ones, we decided that it sounded like a great deal for the money, and though the name is not exactly a household one yet, it was worth a shot, as another buyer said the same thing happened with Vizio a couple of years back.So, we bought it for each other as a joint Christmas gift, figuring what the hey.  If it wasn't as advertised, we'd send it back.  And it had a lot to live up to, considering this was essentially our only gift to each other this year.  It has been over a month now, and we LOVE this television.Pros:- No side glare - you can see the picture well, even if you are sitting on the side of the television.- It is lightweight and super thin, so it is easy to transport.- Very clear picture.- Decent enough sound - you don't really need a sound bar if you don't have one, especially since there are options to change the sound (i.e. \"music\", \"film\", \"surround sound\", etc.)-Provided you are not signed in to a game system (which you can change the video input from your remote), there is a setting where the TV will automatically shut itself off after 10 minutes of lack of use.  This is very helpful if you have a roommate who tends to fall asleep in front of the television.- There are plenty of settings to customize the picture and sound, as well as \"label\" your game systems with the pre-loaded options so you know which video input to select for your X-Box or PS3 (for example, I have the PS3 set to \"Blue Ray\", whereas the X-Box is set to \"Game\").Cons:-It is not a \"smart TV\", if you are in the market for one of those.  It's a simple design, which was perfect for us.-There are no buttons on the TV itself, so if the remote ever breaks, I have no idea how we are going to turn it on and off, aside from buying a new remote.-There are a shortage of plugs in the back for cables.  For example, I can hook up the cable box, X-Box and PS3, but there is no room now for the sound bar.  Not a huge deal, but I could see where some people might find that to be annoying.This television lived up to all of the positive reviews it received here on Amazon, and I am so thoroughly satisfied that we decided to go with this one that I kept reminding myself to write this review so I could help others who were as in the dark as we were about which TV to buy.  I didn't get the dreaded \"green screen\" upon turning it on, as some people have experienced, and the packaging didn't overly give it away that it was a TV, (though we got the 48\" one, so I'm sure people could figure it out).Bottom line: If you are in as much doubt as we were about which TV to buy, trust us on this one - TCL rocks!", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice looking TV too bad it had vertical lines through it.", "Author": "Abe from Detroit", "ReviewID": "R1U9LJYFGIUG7J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this item and I thought that I wouldn't be one of the unlucky folks and actually get a working set... my set turned on and everything but it had a vertical lines through the right side of the TV.

The 2yr warranty was a selling point as well. It seems to be what I wanted & more. The refresh rate allows for a clear picture whether watching sports or playing games.

There are a lot of them. I had already purchased a sound bar & woofer, after reading of the low quality of the sound. It really wasn't required if you don't need a sound system right away. I did not like the fact that the TV does not have an audio out. So, I plugged a splitter into the headset output in the side of the TV & then I had RCA jacks from that to the soundbar.

I've watched DVDs/BluRays and played Xbox games (Far Cry 3) via the HDMI connector. I've also watched regular HD Comcast cable via the component video ports.When the content of what I'm watching is relatively still the screen is absolutely gorgeous.  The colors are vivid and the screen has plenty of brightness/contrast.  As many have pointed out number of inputs are limited, but I knew that when I bought the TV and don't really care.  Some are complaining about the sound.  I use a Onkyo receiver with my TV so again I'd don't really care about the sound.  I checked to make sure the speakers were functional for about 5 minutes then hooked up my receiver.My main issue with this TV is that when there is movement on the screen the video has quite a bit of jutter to it/it gets a bit blurry.  I didn't really expect it given that it is marketed as a 240 Hz TV. I've noticed it with HD Comcast cable over component video, DVD and BluRay via HDMI, and Xbox games via HDMI. I saw some reviewers say they thought only the HDMI inputs where rated for 240 Hz, but I'm seeing this issue on all inputs.  My previous and still working TV is a 40 inch LCD Toshiba from 2009 which is 60 Hz and cost only $400.  As far as the juttering effect goes I don't really see much of an improvement.  It actually looks a little worse, probably because the screen is larger. (The TCL TV jutter looks more like a 60Hz TV)I'm a bit torn about this TV at the moment.  If I could figure out a way to adjust the TV to make lessen this jitter I would keep it, but if I can't I might send it back and spend a little more for a better brand.  But for around $500 bucks this TV is potentially a steal.Has anyone else seen this jutter issue?  What settings are everyone using? Hopefully I just have it setup wrong and there is some magical option I haven't found yet that will fix the issue.  I've tried all the different preset modes, I've tried altering the contrast, brightness and sharpness.  Does anyone that has this TV have any ideas? I saw one post in the questions forum talk about a \"game mode\" but I have yet to find it.  Anyone know if it exists?If I can get this jutter issue resolved I would totally give this TV 5 stars.Hey TCL company I noticed there aren't any firmware upgrade for this product at this time.  Is there anything you guys can go to fix this via firmware?", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a beautiful picture!", "Author": "A.

I had to set it up with a Logitech harmony programmable remote, so I took it out of the box, set it up, turned it on.  It has a wonderful picture!I was worried that the picture wouldn't be very good since it wasn't a \"name brand\" like Samsung.  I have a 46\" Samsung 120hz smart TV and it is a GREAT picture.At first the TCL didn't seem to have a good pic, especially on channels that weren't 1080.  (I only have over the air antenna, most are 1080i, but some are 720p, some are 480p)  I made some adjustments on the picture settings and == GREAT PICTURE!Side by side the picture is the same as my Samsung - especially on the 1080 channels.  I really couldn't tell any difference on the 720 or 480 channels either.Granted, there are fewer inputs and much fewer setup options.  You can change the picture enough to make it great.  I did have to turn off some of the automatic settings, like ambient light sensor that darkens the tv when the room is darker.Now the sound - - It was amazing for an HDTV!  Don't get me wrong, I have my Samsung tied to my stereo with an optical cable and the TCL sound was nothing like that.  BUT - with nothing but the TV speakers, it was easy to hear at 10 feet away, was clear, and didn't crackle.  I turned it up to about 60 and it was TOO LOUD!  I don't know how height it goes, but at 60 I had no rattling, cracking, buzzing or other over-driving issues with the sound.  Again I was just watching TV not a hi-impact movie so your mileage may vary.  Another note, I did have the TV right next to a wall.  Not mounted on a wall, but setting right next to the wall so that may have an impact on sound reflection from the wall.The USB input - I copied several pictures that were taken with my Droid X2 phone to a USB drive.  They were 8 megapixel pics.  They looked amazing also.  The phone takes 16:9 pics, so they were formatted for the screen correctly.  The pics were crisp and clear and you could see detail easily.  I didn't try lower res pics because I didn't have any handy.So...long story even longer...I tested everything because I didn't want to give my dad an inferior product.  He lives in the country and doesn't have cable or internet so smart tv options weren't needed.  He is able to get over the air HDTV and will use the usb to view pictures.  All of these features were VERY ACCEPTABLE.If you have a blu-ray player to do your \"smart tv\" functions, then I would not hesitate to purchase this tv!Only gripe - when you plug in the usb stick, it doesn't automatically jump to that input source and pull up the pictures.Instead you have to press the button and choose the source. Then you have to tell it to do pictures or audio before you get the pictures.  Nothing huge, but not as nice as auto detect and start displaying pictures.On the plus side - it is a 48\" TV not a 46.  Bigger is always better!  It is also a 240HZ which may be why the picture is so good.I didn't try the PC input or use HDMI from my pc to check the monitor quality, but probably will when it is installed at my dad's.  I'll report on that later.Those of you that didn't buy this model because it wasn't name brand, I feel bad for you now.

I was taking a risk on the brand name, having never heard of it, but that risk has more than paid off.  The quality of the picture itself is what surprised me the most when finally be able to view it out of the box.  It rivals that of my current Samsung 55\" LED TV that was more expensive (a lot more expensive...), but that surprised me less when I did research into the brand to find out that the manufacturer of TCL has apparently manufactured screens for Samsung TV's as well.  Another interesting bit of information was that TCL TVs were, until very recently, branded as RCA TVs, so my worries have been alleviated now that I know the brand is trustworthy in terms of problems arising as the product ages.Setting up the TV took me around 2 minutes; nothing difficult in that regard.  My only (slight) disappointment, though I knew this as I made my purchase, was that it only had 2 HDMI ports.  I have a Computer/STB/Blu-Ray/WiFi Media Player/XBox that  I wanted to connect to this TV, but I think I am going to just pick up an HDMI Switch to be able to accomplish this.  Having said that, I really have no other issues with the product.  The design is great - the TV is not as thin as my Samsung, but I attribute this to the Backlit-LED Technology (or at least that's what I've read), and the bezel is a beauty.  I've yet to purchase a wall mount for it, but it seems to be VESA 200x200 compliant.Now this television is not 3D capable nor does it have built in WiFi or internet capability at all for that matter.

Of course there are nicer name brand LED TVs out there but for under $500, who could resist this deal??I was wary of buying this set since it is not a major name brand.  Amazon shipped me the TV via FedEx, so being afraid that FedEx was going to leave this at my doorstep, I had requested to pick it up at a FedEx store. The TV was in flawless condition upon opening and everything worked right out of the box.The thin bezel makes the TV look bigger than it actually is which is really nice for this price. The picture is clear and crisp and the colors are vibrant. There are some settings that you can adjust for the picture and it does come with some standard picture settings. I use my Xbox to play games and watch movies on it and the picture looks spectacular. You can also connect a USB flash drive and play mp3s on the TV.What made me buy this TV was that 240hz refresh rate. There isn't a setting you can adjust in the menu for the refresh rate and I think that for the most part, it defaults to 60hz. 60hz is totally fine for everyday watching but I kind of wished there was a setting to adjust it.Like others have said, the sound on this TV is puny like all other thin TVs on the market. I fixed that problem by investing in a 2.1 sound bar.Overall, I love this TV so far. I have it mounted to a TV stand and looks great in my living room.

The only minor complaint I have about it is also along the lines of what others here have said, the internal speakers are tinny, which was easily solved by plugging in an old boom box with AUX in to the headphone jack from the TV.  The TV remote controls the volume of the headphone jack, so it works out well.Pros:1.  Reasonable boot up time.  About 10 seconds from TCL splash screen to a viewable picture.  A little longer on HDMI.2.  For regular over the air digital TV, reasonable change channel time, about 2 seconds.3.  Great picture on anything that is digital, HDMI or regular over the air TV.4.

Brown", "ReviewID": "R2EZIMFU1R2N9H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing TV for the money so I will just make a few important points. The one we bought at a B&M; does not have \"TA\" at the end of the model name and has a colorful, retail style box compared to, what I heard, a plain box you will receive from here, but same specs.- Don't worry about the brand, it is huge in China but usually is sold in the U.S. under the RCA brand name. Simply use the most common RCA code to program your universal remote for this.- LED BACK lit, not edge. Not quite as thin but WAY better lighting uniformity. Default setting of 80 on the backlight is WAY too bright for home use, be sure to turn down for proper blacks and to avoid cloudiness in dark scenes. Depending on preference try 25-50 with your contrast bumped up to 85-90. This is the ONE thing you should do to get a much better image. Of course personal preference can vary, some prefer super bright even if it creates cloudiness and grey blacks. After having a plasma before this, I have learned to truly appreciate decent black levels.- 240Hz. I truly believe it's there. The Live Video/Soap Opera Effect is usually a result of the way the signal is processed by other brands, yes even good ones. I could be wrong but it appears TCL takes a 60Hz signal and simply quadruples the # of frames internally before displaying the image as is without losing depth of field. I think EVERY 240Hz should be this way and it blows my mind TV's costing double aren't. The biggest example of this is in cable image. I set my cable box for 1920x1080i yet it definitely appears like a very smooth, crisp progressively scanned image. With 60Hz TV's before I would try both 1080i and 720p and not get an image this smooth, so it is definitely doing something and I like it. So yes, use 1080i and not 720p for cable/satellite, it looks much better. I truly believe the 240Hz in fact acts like an upscale feature here.- Very attractive thin and modern looking bezel, this is a pretty big deal in appearance of quality.- Remote is mediocre, but not terrible, especially for the price.- There is a bit more of a delay in switching inputs than other brands. Also have found delays in button response tweaking the sound equalizer. That was annoying.- Image quality is excellent and sound is very mediocre like any LCD. Does not have optical out for receiver, only coax.- Viewing angle does not seem great. I definitely miss that from the plasma we had since I sit off to the side while on my PC.- 2 HDMI's is indeed 1 short of average these days but I think I have found a creative solution. The regular coax/cable input takes the 1080i/720p signal that the cable box provides so I am going to try to hook up my cable using that instead of using up an HDMI I need for my Blu Ray and PC.5 of 5 for the price, 4 out 5 overall with the flaws.

If it does not sound like you, well it is somebody; it is me.Before moving into a new apartment I wanted a sizeable TV that was thin, and had low maintenance (LED vs Plasma--as much as I prefer, sometimes I do not want to worry about burn-in).Here are the TCL's grades:Quality: 7/10 - The poor black levels do not bother me much for what I was expecting from this set.Colors: 7/10Blacks: 5/10In general, watching anything or playing video games is going to be very enjoyable. Colors are bright--as to be expected from an LED and contrasted/saturated well enough not to be noticeable as `bad quality'. Colors look adequate.However, if you care, or are an aggressive advocate, of black levels, you will not approve.  There is much backlight-bleed i.e. white light from the back `bleeding' through the screen like if someone was holding a flashlight behind a black piece of construction paper. On my set it is to the point of a very washed out black in the corners of the screen. The blacks look like black/white mixed together (again, probably from the excessive bleed). That being said, as much as it might is `supposed' to bother me it does not.Sound: 7.5/10As much as I appreciate crystal clear sound, lossless audio and `full' quality of music--I was not turning up the volume on this expecting surround sound. Furthermore, I did not notice that I was using the TV's speakers because it works perfectly suitable, and gets quite loud, for viewing. Do not expect much but; I was impressed.Appeal: 8.5/10Fairly thin bezel, around 2\" thick in the back and it looks great mounted up on a swivel stand (one that can `come out' about 15\") on the wall (because this TV is light, it does not pressure the mount at all). I could lift this by myself easily and hold it on the wall while others would judge the proper position on the wall.---Ending Thought---For a TV in your bedroom, kid's room, play-room, living room, or anywhere this is a must for the budget buy. You will be sacrificing a bit if you dig the depths of quality compared to other higher priced set however, after it is turned on you will know the money saved allows you the peace of mind that you made a purchase for exactly what you were looking for - a quality HD LED TV at a good price.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so great", "Author": "Furuba girl", "ReviewID": "R7JUWCFMRTXTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After some research into TCL, I found out that they've been making TVs for 30 years.

Spoke to 2 supervisors above the rep I spoke to first. The warranty issue has now been resolved through Amazon, but my issue was that the overseas TCL call center rep revealed this is a common issue with this model television. We never even finished the troubleshooting with the representative before they ordered the new part, which only supports that statement. Very disappointed in TCL's warranty department. The first supervisor in the Warranty department needs a re-training in the area of customer service. Who refuses to give a last name?! Still waiting for a return phone call from the higher supervisor. Because of this, we went to the big box B&M; store and bought a larger TV through them. BEWARE: TCL will not cover known issues under their 2 year warranty if you buy through the Warehouse! I no longer recommend this product due to product failure in 9 months and poor customer service.**Edit: 9/12/13 (9 months into the purchase)- we have to unhook all the connections and once we hooked it all back, the unit wouldn't receive any signal (hdmi, coaxial, etc). Called TCL Cust Service and dealt with an overseas agent. Walked through troubleshooting and then was asked to submit my invoice by email. So why did I register the product?! She mentioned they have no access to that information. Seems like a business process that in the year 2013 is common place. Thankfully I was able to whip out a pdf of my Amazon invoice within 5 minutes, but she never called us back. Husband took care of it the next day. Apparently this is a common issue. They had already ordered the part and shipped it to us. Once we receive it within 6 business days, they'll send a technician out to replace it. Hopefully it all goes as planned.

This set (like most LCD/LED sets) suffers from a darkening of the image at any angle other than straight on. This set suffers from it more than most I think, with the brightness drop-off quite stark, not gradual like some other sets I've seen. In my case the TV is set up on the long wall of a rectangular room which exacerbates the issue, so if it were placed on the short wall of a long room this would be less of an issue. But as I mentioned it's mostly being use by the kids, and they like to pause the DVR for hours at a time which is no issue for this type of TV but isn't great for plasma so for my purposes it's very good.Overall a good set, great price, accurate product info and helpful reviews here, and UPS shipping of the 48\" model was flawless.

I think the refresh rate performs even better than some plasma tv's that I have seen.When I'm watch HD content the picture is very clear. It's an LED screen and unlike some other LED tv's that I have seen, the lights are directly behind the screen instead of on the sides which is nice. When a tv uses LED lights on the sides of the screen, the picture is lighter around the edges and darker towards the center, especially at night. Even though the screen is back-lit, it is not entirely uniform. When there is a really dark or light scene in the movie or show that you are watching, you can see some areas of the screen that are more lit than others. It's not really noticeable, but I am very nit-picky. The other 99.9% of the time the screen lighting looks uniform.The sound is more than adequate when it comes to actual volume level.

I have the brightness set at 47 out of 100 so I dont think you'll have issues there.The two year warranty is awesome and covers both parts and labor.I got this tv for $400 bucks. I lucked out because $400 bucks is at the top of my price range. But if I had $900 to spend, I would get this tv over any other brand that you'll find right now in the 500-900 dollar range. You wont find another tv with this good picture, 240Hz, LED, great sound, two year warranty in that price range.

I did some research, specifically comparing TCL to LG. The two seemed comparable and I was able to get a better deal on the TCL. I bought the 55 inch model to replace a 47 inch Philips. The threads for mounting the TV to the wall were different, so I had to go to Home Depot to buy four screws that fit. Other than that it went right on the same mount I had been using. However, the location of the holes was lower on the back which made it a little more difficult to mount. I saw some questions about using the DirecTV controller with this set. I have Dish Network, and like DirecTV, there was no code listed for any TCL models. However, using the scan mode I was able to find a setting the allowed the DVR controller to control the TV. It can turn the set on and off, change the volume and the input source, which is all I really needed. One interesting feature of this set is you can suppress some but not all of the unused input labels. This is nice when you are selecting the input source so you only need to choose from the ones that are active. You can't suppress the antenna input or the USB input labels. One final note - there are two similar models, one that ends in Z and one that ends in ZTA. I have been unable to tell how they are different. Even the TCL website lists them both but the specs appear identical.

Immediately afterward I had a little buyers remorse as I saw there were 47\" and 50\" TVs that were priced so low on black Friday but I have been completely happy after putting the TV up.We mainly wanted a larger TV with a great picture but didn't need to have extras like internet, netflix, 3d, etc.  We already have a internet connected home theater and WDTVLive so just wanted a nice bigger screen and we are completely happy.  The TV has 2 HDMI inputs along with component, composite and PC inputs.  At first, we had a problem with the aspect ratio on some shows/commercials where the picture did not fully fill the screen (black bars on sides and/or top).  On our old TV, there was a display option to change the aspect ratio on the TV but on the TCL it took some time for me to figure out to use the \"zoom\" button which cycles through the different ratios (the answer was actually in the manual).The only bad part about our experience was the free delivery from Amazon which used CEVA logistics but I won't mark down the TV rating for it.  I got an email from domain EAGLE1.CEVALOGISTICS.COM advising to call CEVA to schedule the delivery once the TV arrived at our city.  I called the next day and spent about 10 minutes on the phone as I was passed to 4 other people before being told that they couldn't take any schedule from me yet and that I should wait until someone calls me.2 days later, I got another email saying CEVA called my home# and left a voicemail and that I should call them ASAP to schedule delivery.  I checked and none of our contact#s had any voicemail or caller id from unknown #s.  I called CEVA back and was passed to a couple of other people who took the info on when to deliver and to call my wife cell phone before coming.

My list of requirements: a LED 50-55\" screen, 240 Hz, adequate number of HDMI ports, at least a 1 year warranty, under $1000, and a significant number of favorable reviews by home buyers. Items I removed from my initial list were 3D (most reviews of 3D on HDTV were negative), internet connection (since external devices could provide this as well if not better), and a quality sound (since I intend to connect to a 5.1 home theater). The only TV that met all of my requirements was the TCL.I was nervous when the TV arrived (based on some Amazon reviewer experiences) and anxious to plug it but the delivery men STRONGLY advised to let the TV sit for at least 4 hours to adapt to home climate before taking it out of the packaging and plugging it in (it was around 32 degrees the day my TCL arrived). So I let the delivery men go and waited 4 hours. During that time I checked the internet and did find some information regarding potential condensation problems on the electronics as cold tvs warm up and some concerns about the liquid part of the LED screen in extremely cold weather. I figure better safe than sorry so I waited.I've had this TV running now for about 2 weeks. I love the clarity and color. Blacks are deep, no fading. All pixels are working. I am using an antenna with rabbit ears and I get about a dozen stations but just purchased a directional HDTV antenna and will be setting that up in the attic later this week. The HD stations are just as good as the cable pictures I used to get on a 52\" Sony Bravia I had back a few years ago. I don't like any of the picture presets (color too strong, faces too red) but with some fine tuning, I am very happy with my personal settings. I did use the sports setting last night to watch my first football game and the green and gold uniforms looked as fantastic as Rodgers' passes.The Blu-Ray DVDs are also just beautiful on this TV. I am running my HP desktop through an HDMI connection to the TCL. It took some time and patience to work across 2 monitors get the correct PC screen resolution on the TCL and to get the HDMI sound working. Thankfully I found the solutions on internet forums and through trial and error.I would not be able to listen to the speakers provided in this TV, maybe because I accustomed to higher quality audio systems.As long as this TV continues to perform for the next several years as it is right now, I will be extremely happy with my decision to forgo the better known brand names and the extra features.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price.", "Author": "AudiNick", "ReviewID": "R12M7AFGG60HIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV around Black Friday and have had a couple of weeks to try it out.I have been very pleased with the picture quality of the set as well as the viewing angle.The placement of the speakers (on the bottom pointing down) were not ideal for my situation as I had the set in a tv recess above my fireplace.

I've been extremely irritated all weekend, but I couldn't make any plans for Friday because I expected delivery until Thursday afternoon and then I had to blow off my plans with my children today because I didn't know if they would deliver during the wrong window or if they would deliver when I told them to deliver.

This my first HD TV. All my experience is in what I have watched at my friends/relatives/local sports bar. So merit my opinion with that in mind.Was a little leery of buying an 'off' brand, but some research and reading various reviews, along with the price and 2 year warranty pushed me into it. Seems to be some talk about poor customer support, but I have found that to be a pretty universal problem more and more. Trick is to pray you get a working device to begin with. I picked this model also for the feature set, or more to the point, lack of. You can spend several hundred dollars more for online smart features on the TV, or $50.00 more on the Blue Ray player for the same stuff. Easy choice for me.Setup was painless. Plenty of connections for my purposes as the only thing that will be plugged into it will be my cable box and a Blu Ray player (yet to arrive). Had it hooked up to my Uverse box and functioning in 15 minutes (some of that was just playing with menus). Had to wait about another hour for my HD signal to get turned on by AT$T though. (Remember above, first HD TV. And yes I did order HD turned on before hand, took a followup call to get it working).Results? For my untrained eyes, pretty damn stunning. Watched some football games (GO TEXANS!!!), then flipped back and forth between some movies (some action types, some not) and some regular stuff like news and a cooking show. Picture is crystal clear and colors are amazing. A night time overhead shot of Cowboy Stadium looked like I was there. No funny textures on the blacks. Never noticed any ghosting or blurring on the sports or action movies. Even my wife, who was not really on board for this (and the Blu Ray player and the HD channel fee from AT$T, etc) was impressed.I'll mention sound just to say the built in speakers are about what I've experienced in any TV I've ever owned.

I have installed it on the wall and am very happy. If you don't need the WiFi and built in software like Hulu or Netflix then this is a very good purchase. One thing that it's not mentioned is that you cannot adjust the Hz on this TV, I guess it is set at 240Hz and that's that. Also, if you have a universal remote control and want to program for this TV you will need to use the RCA codes, there are no TCL remote codes in the manual.

Two full days before the expected date. Those results are just amazing.I was nervous this TV would lack in style, picture, and overall features.

I wasnt expecting it to be super slim like those $1000+, but it is SLIM. The bezel is awesome, its heavy, sturdy, and stylish, all things you want to hold your new purchase.The remote it came with is a pretty standard remote, works fine, looks fine, nothing special.

The picture on this 48\" TCL has given me more compliments on how it looks in the past week than my Sony,Samsung's,Vizio's,or Panasonic's ever have in the past year. And for those that care about the cost of an item, this TCL cost less than half.My settings given to me by others here that work remarkable....Backlight- 49Contrast- 80Brightness- 50Color- 62Light sensor-OffNoise reduction-lowSharpness-50Contrast is amazing. Blacks and whites and all colors are fantastic. Watching from every angle is just as clear as well. I put on great quality blu rays like, \"Tron Legacy\", \"Jaws\", \"Fright Night\" and \"Return Of The Living Dead\" and was blown away! Then put on DVDs that weren't 1080p....\"Son Of The Beach\", \"Bubba Ho Tep\" and \"Disturbing Behavior\". I WAS BLOWN AWAY!! I picked \"Bubba\" and \"Disturbing\" because they are very dark films so if any trouble with picture quality could pop up, it would have. But it didn't.Please believe me, I don't work for TCL. If you need proof of that, my complaint is having only 2 hdmi's for a tv this size is kinda stupid. But, it's not the end of the world. Remove one, insert the other.The final thing I'll say and I know not many people know this and a lot would disagree, but the higher you set your backlight the sooner you will have technical problems with your TV. It took a while for me to get companies to tell me what is safe or not but eventually they did when I told them I wouldn't buy from them again if they didn't.If you set your backlight higher than 50% you will have a bigger chance of technical difficulties sooner than if you didn't. Finally, Sony, Samsung, Vizio and Panasonic and Sharp admitted this.The reason why this is important when it comes to this TCL is because the setting I mentioned earlier are excellent quality picture settings that do not work on the other brands. I have to set my Sony's and Samsung's much much higher than my TCL to get close to the quality I want.In other words I get a better picture with my TCL at a much safer longer lasting setting than I do with my TV's that are double the cost.P.S.I hardly ever praise something, but this TV was worth it.

I feel it's justified since TCL should really test these things out before shipping them. If anyone else out there bought this, I really hope you received a better unit than I did. After the delivery service tested it to get the blue screen, they left, I assembled the base and got it on the stand. I hooked up my xbox, blue ray, and mac mini, and ran the scan for my leaf antenna. As soon as a full screen picture came up, I noticed three really bright dots in the upper left side, vertically aligned. I hoped they would go away as the unit warmed up. No, been over an hour and they are still there. I called their customer service number in the manual (which they call \"Level 1\") and they could not help me with the general quick fix suggestions - unplug it and plug it back in, unplug all inputs and plug them back in, etc. So, they gave me to \"Level 2\" support. Their suggestion was to call Amazon and have them replace it since it would take 3 to 4 weeks for TCL to fix it.Rather than replace it, though, I think I am done trying out these cheaper brands. My 37\" Samsung has been great for 4 years now. I'm sticking with that brand since Samsung already has my trust.HOWEVER, I should let you all know that the picture seems fine otherwise. I was initially worried about the response time, but have noticed no streaking. Color looks good and there are a lot of options for you to play with to get the settings you want. If price is more of an object than reliability, go for this television! I bought it because some forums said TCL makes panels for Samsung. I thought it was worth a gamble, but I lost.BTW, the only audio out is for digital coaxial, no composite or optical. Couldn't see that very well from the photos, and this item page on Amazon doesn't list all the available ports like other HDTV pages do. The unit's speakers are typical HDTV cruddy, so plan accordingly.UPDATE: Turns out, you have to turn on the TV first before consoles or whatever you have it plugged into. Otherwise it was only displaying my xbox at 480p, and there was no way for me to change it in the TV's menu! Plus, the sound would not work - not through the headphone jack which I've plugged 2.1 Yamaha into, nor through the TV's own speakers.

Picture quality is beyond incredible.  I have to start my description with that statement because, based on reviews, I was hoping for an incredible TV, basic, at a low price.  This TV is not incredible.  Frankly, if I had seen this TV in the display room before purchase, I wouldn't have purchased for the price, but I have become incredibly spoiled and I understand that is influencing my decision.Physical:Approx 1/2\" bezel in front.  It LOOKS like a slim TV, but it's about 2-3\" deep.  the deeper part is more towards the center of the monitor on the back and so not extremely noticeable.The base is glass.  Looks nice.LED back-lit (which is why it's thicker)So, what's not to love about this TV from my perspective?Fast motion blurs.  I'm really disappointed in this and it is my biggest gripe based on the TV stats.Screen has a static feel to it.  (the many LED lights coming on and going off when screens pan, can be noticeable and causes the static/raining effect)Text is NOT crisp.  this surprised me the most and is noticeable when the start up screen with branding first comes on.Blue-rays don't look... well... sharp and crystal clear.Pros:The TV itself looks nice.It worked, although mine came out of the box upside down...  amusing.Amazon is currently including white glove delivery to whatever floor/room.  They won't set-up the stand, but will pull out the TV and plug it in to make sure it's in good condition and you get the menu/start screen.$17 a year energy rating.So, should MY cons influence you to not purchase this TV or am I really just too picky?  It will really depend.  I highly recommend you see it in the store and judge for yourself but I'll try to list reasons it would and would not work for you down below.Why this might work for you:It's a Monitor, it works (so far), and other cheap models have the same quality of which this is the cheapest.The monitor itself looks nice (physically, not the screen)If you're upgrading from a smaller cheap model, this is just a larger cheap model.You're like my wife and not that picky (although she notices a few things, she doesn't notice a lot that I do)Did I mention this was cheap?  It'll depend on what the sale price is but you can snag it for as low as $599 both on and off of Amazon.Why it might not:You're used to high end displays and are spoiled and can't return to a lesser display, because this IS a lesser display.  I wouldn't even put it at mid-level.  Not low end, but low mid-level for sure.These supposed great specs are comparable to lesser spec'd TV's.  (I believe these specs are incorrect or someone is getting away with lying via technicalities, but I'm not an AV tech geek, just my impression.)If service is important, you may be disappointed based on reviews I've read.Fast motion blurring will bother you.FULL SCREEN DVD ISSUE - stretches to fit screen instead of boxing.So, I have this TV and I'll be checking it out over the next year.  I wouldn't have purchased if I'd seen it before hand, but I have it now, so we'll see.  As normal for me, I'll be updating based on experience.  A lack of update will likely mean it's working and no issues as I tend to review around a month, three month, half year, and year time periods and I tend to be extremely busy so I don't always get around to updating at exactly those points unless I'm irked in which case I'd do it before those time points.***update 2013.05.09***I'm updating sooner than I expected with observations.1.)  Angle of view is pretty good.  I have a 32\" in the same room that I just mounted for the treadmill and it's incredibly noticeable.  It also has fantastic brightness.2.)  I've been looking at text closer to see why it's \"broken\".  The tiny squares go dark in the middle of text for some reason.  I'm not sure why.  Sometimes it seems to flicker a little.3.)  After having used the screen a bit, the text issue is the most noticeable thing.  The rest I'm beginning to ignore.4.)  DVD FULL SCREEN ISSUE!!!!  If you have DVD's in full screen, this TV STRETCHES the image to fit.  A huge irritation as this is the TV designated to play all the old crappy DVD's.  Luckily most my old widescreens DVDs are on netflix.5.)  A bit of a cloudy issue with black/grey colors.  Most people won't notice and if you're the type to notice this may not be the TV for you.Overall, the TV is okay.

They sent me a box of parts that came via UPS four days after my initial call, and they put me in touch with a repair guy.  He showed up and seemed to have a pretty routine time replacing some boards and getting my TV back up and running.  He said that they had recalled the original set of boards and that the new ones he installed should be more reliable.The screen itself is pretty much what I expected.  I'm not an expert but my eyeballs have no qualms with the picture quality.  Having only two HDMI ports is certainly a limitation, but not one that I didn't know about when I made the purchase.If the TV hadn't broken I'd be giving it 4 stars.  Of course, it did break.

I bought it back in November 2012.So, I called into support (for the first time - see below for second). I told the guy what the issue was and was told the voltage in house too low. I told him was working fine for year and that lately it takes up 10 minutes to turn on. Support rep kept saying not enough voltage to keep it on so it would shut down to recharge.... I kept telling him that the TV does not shut off and that was not the problem. The problem was taking up to 10 minutes to turn on. He kept repeating our problem is that it shuts off and I finally started yelling at him \"NO that's not our problem\". He still kept at the voltage problem, and so I hung up and called back in to hopefully get someone else.I called back and luckily got a different person - woohoo! I explained the problem and he asked what I tried so far, which is nothing. He instructed me to unplug from surge protector and put directly into the wall. Makes sense - maybe the surge protector is funky. I did that and turned on the TV, which took several minutes to start up again. This is the fun part: He says well its working so just continue to bypass surge protector, and if that doesn't work plug into a different outlet and call back in 3 days if still having problems!!I asked why does he consider it working in that it took several minutes for the TV to turn?  He says is the TV on and working right now?  Yes, I said. Well then its working fine according to him!  Again I repeated the delay in turning it on and he said that could be normal. I called bull-sugar on that statement, and he repeated to keep it off the surge protector for 3days and monitor it. WHAT THE FUDGE??

It also does not get very loud. - The Tv is listed as 240 HZ refresh but it does not offer anything close to that. - The input lag is decent but not as fast as it could be. It is slower than my last Tv but not horrible. i could not find actual values for this. - the ports are annoying and on the side rather than in the back. though this could be a benefit for some people i guess. - the Tv sits very close to the base.

The big one for me is the cracking noise it makes on random occasions usually after its been on for a while, or if you turned it off recently. I have a feeling it will do this less and less the longer I own it, since I haven't heard it in a while, but to explain what I'm talking about, its kind of like when your car has just been turned off and you hear it making little pops and cracks as it slowly cools off. Well, this TV does that as well. Its extremely minor and its kind of just a nit-picking thing, but the first time it cracked(settled?) it actually did scare me a little.

I got an immediate reply telling me that an executive from the company would contact me the next day.The guy called me and was very responsive to my complaints.  He apologized and immediately got in touch with the warranty company (A&D; electronics - who I still can't say enough bad things about!) and my problem was immediately resolved.TCL genuinely seemed to be as outraged as I was, so I'm raising my review to 3 stars.  The TV deserves more, but I can't let them completely off the hook for their vendors actions. *******I bought this tv for my mother in law to put in her room and while the tv itself has a lot of features and came with a good price, it stopped working a couple of weeks after we bought it.I did the trouble shooting as listed in the manual to no avail.  I called in for service and the lady on the phone seemed confused and wanted a bunch of information that wasn't on the Amazon receipt.  She also insisted on the serial number, which is located on the back of the tv, so I had to remove it from the wall in order to get it (though I had all of the information other information from the Amazon receipt.  They they made me print, scan and email the receipt and THEN call back to arrange service.At this point, they said that they were going to send out a part and that when I got it, I was to call them back to schedule the technician to come out.  When the part never showed up, I called them back and the lady said that the part had never been sent.  So, they ordered the part again and told me that it would be here in two days....it showed up a week later!I then called them back (again) and they told me that a technician would call me in a few days....at this point, I was getting pissed, but remained calm and asked if they might be able to expedite the matter since we had been waiting since March 20th when I first called them.  They told me that they would see what they could do.Today, I got a call from the tech and he can't get out here until later in the week...that would mean that IF he can fix the tv that my mother in law will have had this tv for about 6 weeks or so and that it will have been broken 3 of them.I called AGAIN and the lady said that if they put in a new work order that I will go back to the back of the line.  The supervisor told me that there wasn't anything that she could do.  I asked if she could call the repair company and at least see if there was a different tech who might be able to make it out sooner and she told me, \"no, I won't do that\".I located a different number for the TCL and have been on hold for the time it took me to write this review (about 20 minutes).....So, I'm seriously regretting this purchase and considering simply returning the tv at this point.  I don't know if that is what I'll do, but if I was thinking about buying this tv again, I'd go with a different brand.

It is a replacement of the same TCL TV I received a week previously that upon delivery and powering it on we saw it had a defective picture, and I refused delivery. I was disappointed that it was probably internal damage from shipping. I called Amazon right away and they had a replacement shipped out that same day. The replacement was in my city within 48 hours, though the local delivery company couldn't schedule it to deliver over the weekend. But it was at my house one week after the first TV was refused. Good job, Amazon, on the fast replacement service!This one looked excellent right out of the box. It was easy to assemble the base and connect to my AT&T; U-Verse receiver and my Sony PS3. I already knew I would connect my older Sony stereo surround system to it and I had already bought a coax cable to connect to the headphone jack on the back. I use that for mostly movies. Personally, I think the TV speakers are fine for normal TV shows.The quality of the picture on this is excellent. It is as good as any I have seen on bigger name brand TVs in stores. And I am amazed at how good Blu-ray movies look on it! I did customize the color settings according to other reviews I read here and adjusted to my own preferences.I researched and bought this TV based on price and the reviews I read here. I wanted best quality I could get at a price I could afford. So far, I feel I got a very good deal...a 55-inch TV with fast refresh rate under $700. I debated whether I should just get a 46-48 inch TV and save more money, but as much as I enjoy a home theater experience and sharing that with family and friends I decided the 55-inch was the one to get.

At $499 this 48inch LED display seemed like a great deal and when I read the reviews here and elsewhere I was sold.Pros:Although the 240HZ refresh rate isn't a critical feature for a display primarily used with PC sources the contrast and dynamic LED backlight results in terrific picture quality. I found the feature set to be well organized and easy to use and the tuner has more than adequate sensitivity using an indoor antenna even 40 miles or more from some stations. Setup as a PC display can be tricky, especially if the TV is part of a multiple display environment because of aspect ratio and resolution limitations of some PC video adapters but this TV gave me no grief whatsoever. So far I am very pleased with the performance, backlight conformity and overall picture quality. And, no dead or stuck pixels. The glass base is very sturdy and adds a nice bit of weight to help stabilize the TV with a very small footprint.Cons:Even with the implied 240HZ refresh rate this is not a 3D capable TV. Just something to be aware of in case as some do, you assume that the high refresh rate means it is 3D compatible. For my purposes this is not an issue. There are also a limited number of predetermined selections for on-screen input labels. I prefer full text labels to more quickly identify connected sources. Lastly, the power cord is not detachable - I find this a bit odd and it can result in adding a little difficulty to some  installations but it's certainly not a show-stopper.I expect the price to creep up in the near future but even if it does the picture quality gives far more expensive 48\" LED TV's a true run for the money.**** UPDATE ****After using the TCL LE48FHDF3300ZTA for a while now I still find myself thinking \"I love this display.\" With the dynamic backlight, black is truly black, not dull gray. Viewing angle is incredible - I have it mounted directly above my home office desk because I frequently work and watch movies at the same time and even at close range and a steep viewing angle this beast is perfectly comfortable and easy to watch. I tend to keep the video attributes conservative but when I want to watch a blue-ray movie or live sports with high contrast and brightness this display is simply eye-popping and puts you right in the action. Even black and white movies from the 1940's and 1950's reveal the great cinematic attributes the filmmakers sought to present to the audience.

Sanderson", "ReviewID": "R11QDS5OYIOKE2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this TV to replace our aging rear-projection 42\" Samsung.  Overall, this was a significant upgrade, and so far I am pleased with the purchase.Setup was very simple.  But you'll need two people.  The unit isn't heavy, but it's awkward.  The glass pedestal is sturdy and looks nice.  You'll need a phillips to screw the bracket and stand to the unit, but that only took a few minutes.  The input jacks were clearly marked.  I hooked up the Tivo unit and a DVD with no problems, and when I turned it on, everything came up perfect.The remote control unit is well designed, but of course, I wanted to use the Tivo remote with the new TV.  My Tivo is a few years old, so it didn't have the codes for any TCL brands,  which was not unexpected.  I couldn't find any compatible codes via an Internet search, so I bought a new Tivo remote with the learning capability.  I had no trouble making it \"learn\" the remote codes, and I actually like the new Tivo remote better than the old one.The picture is nice and bright and crisp. Our Tivo unit outputs 1080i, not 1080p, so I'm probably missing out on even more sharpness just because of that, but it's a great picture.  You'll probably want to tweak the color settings a bit.  I found some of the faces in the live news broadcasts to look a little pasty, so I backed down the contrast a little, and also made a slight adjustment to the color settings.The only negative I have to note is the speakers.  They are crap.  The sound was tinny and hallow, and no amount of adjusting the equalizer made it sound any better.  So I bought some nice computer speakers for less than $100, and now it sounds great.  So, if you buy this TV, plan to buy either computer speakers or a sound bar, or else your media experience will be less than you'd like.  That's the only reason I'm dinging this by one star.You can't beat the price.  We've had the unit for less than a month, so I can't vouch for the longevity or service, but so far, I'm pretty happy.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Still haven't received the neck to attach tv to the stand", "Author": "Ed Cowell", "ReviewID": "R3TQTA5U9SWZYC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Called amazon support.

Wallace", "ReviewID": "R3MAUC9LJ7RXN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Edited to add: I've seen a number of people asking about DirecTV remotes and this TV; 11953 works properly, with our RC64 remote.I've only had this TV for one day, so I can't speak to long-term reliability yet. First impressions are very good, though. I wanted a big screen, low power consumption, and didn't want 3D, apps, or Wi-fi. The  positive reviews for this TCL sold me.Setup was quick and painless, though coming from an older 32\" LCD to this took a few minutes to adjust. The thin bezel and glass stand look good, in an understated way, and I had no issues with the 4 screws used to secure the base. Since the TV had been in a cold delivery truck for hours, I let it warm up to room temperature for an hour before turning it on. This isn't mentioned in the manual, but I've seen it spoken to many times, and it seemed reasonable.I connected a DirecTV DVR via HDMI, and an upconverting DVD player via component cables. The picture looked just fine on ECO mode (the stock setting), and the sound was fine to my ears. I did turn the \"surround\" effect on, but haven't noticed much difference. HD programming looks fantastic, but lower resolution stuff can look a little blurry, which I expected. I'm sure part of this is the size of the TV and our seating distance (11 feet). DVDs look good, for the most part, and once we upgrade to Blu-Ray, I'm sure we'll be suitably impressed. I haven't noticed any clouding or backlight bleed, but our living room is reasonably well lit most of the time.That leads to my one minor complaint: the screen is more to the glossy side, and we needed to adjust a lamp to eliminate a reflection. If this will be in a sunny room, you'll want to get some light-blocking curtains.I do have a couple other complaints, but again, they're minor: 2 HDMI ports is the bare minimum for a TV this size. I'd like to have another, or perhaps 4 total. I can always swap a device in or out, and I suppose most people have a receiver that handles the HDMI switching.I'm very happy with this purchase, and as our home theater grows, this should really come into it's own.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "48-inch", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R38FXI8J3KAN0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hooked the TV up as soon as it arrived.

Using windows 7 in 1080p on a 48 inch tv is quite an experience.Bottom line: This is a hell of a good TV for an amazing price.Cons: 240 Hz really isn't noticable over a 120 Hz or even 60 Hz. It doesn't generate a true motion picture that i was expecting, but it is still an excellent picture nonetheless. If you're looking for true motion (which makes your movies look way more fake and cheap than they should, by the way), then go for a samsung, or some other 1200 TV of the same size.Other thoughts: Go with an X shaped mount over a parallel bar style mount.

Big 55 in, ultra slim, very bright, and color is nice..I'm an extremely picky person, not your average TV viewer.  I played sports, MKV 1080P movie files, blu-ray, don't get me wrong, the picture is great (outstanding for the size and price)... but something just seemed lacking.  After a while I realized it's a bit grainy a times regardless the type of aforementioned source I play it from and the overall color saturation seemed a bit lacking.  Also.. black seemed grayish sometimes.Most of all.. as some of the user reviewed, playing sport from HD cable box, watch Blu ray movie and 1080P file, I do not see any 240HZ effect (soap opera, or real life motion effect).  I have nothing to measure whether it's 240hz or not but does not seem to be a REAL 240hz TV.In all fairness, I'm an apple product user.. Macbook pro, Ipad (retina), Iphone 5.. which all use top of the line panel with great color and this TV just did not measure up to the color saturation of the aforementioned product I owned (not that it should, I understand you get what you pay for).  This may explain why I felt this TV's color and picture was lacking.I finally went to xxxxbuy and spent money on a Samsung LED 240HZ TV and played both side by side.  TCL is not bad at all and for the price, TCL is great! but in no way does it measure up to Samsung LED's picture.  I played exact same movie files, blu ray on both TV and Samsung displayed rich black, no grainy image and most of all, the Samsung 240hz instantly showed me what a TRUE 240hz should look like and that TCL was a bit lacking even though it advertised itself as such.Conclusion:  I returned the TCL and kept the Samsung.  TCL is a great TV if you understand \"great\" is relative to price.  Don't expect this TV to measure up to higher end Sony/Samsung and you will be happy with it.  You will NOT find a greater TV for the price, but if you are like me who is extremely picky on color saturation and picture quality, you might want to shell out a bit more money.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly surprised", "Author": "smp89", "ReviewID": "R21CV08ZO1YVV6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was very weary about purchasing this tv for my parents being that it is not a brand I am familiar with.

The few issues with this particular tv is that the images 'ghost trail' with movement [using DishNet and it doesn't do this on the LCD's.]  (example; The famous picture of a night highway with the lights trailing as the cars speed by.)  The tv has to 'warm up' I figure because it gets better the longer the tv is on also with Noise Reduction set to low.Using a ps3, the picture turns to blocky quality.  As in I see blocks from where I suppose the picture connects to the lights in squares under the screen.  Merely annoying, not supremely noticable but it is there. It's sort of like looking at your monitor and noticing the dots that make up your screen.For a big tv at such a low cost, issues are bound to be there even if it were at a higher cost.

I considered getting a replacement, but after looking at the over-all display quality and the options on the TV, I decided that it just wasn't worth it.The display looks noticeably pixelated from a few feet away, and from several feet back, everything (especially people's faces) have that soft, cartoonish look to them that makes them look like they're wearing waaaay too much makeup. I've found this to be typical on low-priced LCD/LED TVs. My current LCD (which this TV was supposed to replace) has no such over-softening effect.Another issue was the near-complete lack of connections, primarily outputs. The inputs are rather limited (the analog and component inputs SHARE a video-in, so you can only use one at a time).

It seems as if the edges of the text aren't anti-aliased, or that the contrast on the TCL is so poor that its not capable of anti-aliasing the text with any convincing quality. Another weakness is in the lack of contrast in the whites. If you're watching a sporting event where the players are wearing white uniforms, you'll cringe.
