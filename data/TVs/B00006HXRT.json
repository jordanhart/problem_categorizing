The picture is totaly fuzzy and the colors are dull.  I messed with the settings called Viewsonic support, no help, the picture just remains lousy.I tried a DVD with my progressive scan DVD player and the picture was misarable.For sure the unit won't work as a computer monitor.Don't waste your money or time on this one.", "Date": "June 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "Pretty Darn Good For Under 3K!", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R3UC9PE2AQUYO3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "O.K.----I think our man Steve from CA. might have been better served if he had read the owner's manual first, and then had professional installation. THIS IS NOT A HDTV!  It will take the signal, but will have to \"dumb it down\" to display.  But that display is absolutely gorgeous: sharp colors, wide viewing angle and NO artifacts.  As for using the display as a computer monitor, I would be hard pressed to recommend it any higher.  As with all viewsonic monitors I have owned in the past, apps from word processing to the newest games are just perfect.  I connected my cable to a media center computer I built, and now use a nifty program called Snapstream that puts the old TIVO to shame!  Now my wife can tape her soaps, easily burn her favorites to DVD, check her E-Mail, surf the web, video chat with her mom, play Tetris (O.K.---she's a little behind the times in her gaming!), find that song she has been looking for, etc----all from the comfort of our bed.  She's now happy as a clam, which any guy will tell you pays the ol' hubby dividends far greater than the sub 3K cost of the unit.  And I must admit, I can't wait for Halflife II on a big monitor with the display settings jacked to the max!  Two caveats:  Again, no HDTV.  Perhaps more importantly, if you are going to set this unit up yourself, you ought be an enthusiast.  Trying the many input choices enabled me to decide on the best option for myself, which proved to be the DVI for the computer, and the S-Video for all TV functionality except for DVD playback, which benefits with progressive scan connections (you know, that red blue yellow thingy).  If you rely on the manual alone, you are apt to be left confused, as it is far too brief and poorly written.  If you feel, as I do, that the PC is the future engine to drive home entertainment, this unit is an excellent partner!", "Date": "February 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Not bad for an EDTV, but it's not HDTV.", "Author": "Kathy Taylor \"KTaylor\"", "ReviewID": "R1H75WGSEV3AXF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all, this TV is an EDTV 'monitor', not an HDTV as they want you to think.  I received mine today, and the actual spec is buried on p.16 of the manual.  This TV is only capable of displaying 480p max, and can receive HDTV signals that are passed through an external decoder (the decoder is not built in).  However those 780p/1080i HDTV signals are downconverted to 480p.  Same with Progressive-scan DVDs.  I wish I would have known this before ordering.  Now, the picture looks nice, but $3k is a lot to spend on a widescreen TV, even though it's a flat-panel.", "Date": "November 21, 2003"}, {"Title": "Another quality product from Viewsonic....", "Author": "Stephen W Gotz", "ReviewID": "R1QQOI8HDU43SD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this plasma display for a little over two weeks now and have been pleased.  I've owned several other Viewsonic lcd displays and all were high quality and lasted a long time.  Out of the box the default colors/settings need calibration, but once this was done the picture jumped off the screen.  The images now look very accurate and life-like.There are ample inputs in the back of the unit to hook up just about any kind of home theater equipment.The only complaint I have would be with the slight buzzing noise the unit makes after warming up.  It isn't very loud and from what I hear this is pretty much standard on most plasma's out there.All in all another great product from Viewsonic.", "Date": "October 14, 2003"}, {"Title": "Solid product, great price", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3FZTUNEEH7B14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently got my bonus and immediately ordered this model.  No regrets!  The picture quality is very good.  Not as bright as Fujitsu's units, but for this price I'm really happy.  Don't believe that guy from California; I've done research online and most reviews are very positive about this one.", "Date": "November 12, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent Plasma for under $3000.00", "Author": "Kevin C. Fowler", "ReviewID": "R7JL0WWTOW4Z5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This viewsonic T.V. is great as long as you know how to hook it up.  Unlike regular T.V.'s if you hook up to this T.V. using the Coax Cable the picture will be awful.  Now if you hook up using the S-Video, Componet, or Composite Video the picture will be perfect.  That's why Plasma's are considered monitors instead of T.V.'s  What the cable and satilite companies don't tell you is that you 50% of signal strength when you use the coax cable hook-up, or what others call the RF adapter.  Regular T.V.'s can make up for this signal loss plasma's can't.  So for all you out there do some research before you buy a Plasma.", "Date": "October 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "A terrible, terrible TV", "Author": "M.

The remote is a giant brick with all the important buttons hidden under a slider.  The image quality was fuzzy and poor.  The screen would glitch every once in a while for no apparent reason.  Any white or bright area on the TV (even with the brightness turned down low) would cause a terrible BUZZING sound from inside the unit.  Weighing in at 90 pounds, it was difficult to even rotate it a little by yourself.Let me put it this way -- I had the TV for about 2 months before someone broke into my office and stole it.
