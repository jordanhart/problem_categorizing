The picture quality is outstanding, the panel is gorgeous & the features are numerous.  I love the PIP capability which is rare in recent tv's & nmot even mentioned in most ads!  I always find it interesting that the PIP feature is not promoted or even included in most \"large display\" sets, because when you have this much room that is the beauty of it!  If there was one thing I wish the tv had was a VGA (or SVGA) connector for connecting to a computer.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Damaged delivery", "Author": "Johnny M.
