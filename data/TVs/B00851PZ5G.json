All I can say is, what a picture!  I have zero complaints about this tv, or its sound.  It mounted on my wall very easily.  I would not hesitate to purchase another tv made by TCL.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice", "Author": "pierre chelala", "ReviewID": "R48FIOURKD7XM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very nice TV.

So far, I am very happy with it.  The price helped...:)  I would however, like to  hook it up to my cable DVR in 1080 to see the difference in picture clarity, etc.  It's for my bedroom and I haven't yet made the jump to pay my cable provider the additional monies for a second DVR.  Probably will though.  Does not have a 'tinny' sound.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Direct TV Remote", "Author": "SedaliaDan", "ReviewID": "R2O763ZUH5FZMU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased TCL from Tiger Direct arrived on time & works great. Can not program Direct TV (DTV) remote to work with TCL 39\" TV. TCL not listed in DTV remote program guide. Called DTV, they had no information on the TCL brand. They walked me through the \"genetic\" settings but nothing worked. Gave up. Have to use two remotes.

I had never had a flat screen before and was elated.  I got the TV in November and as I watching it, the picture went out on me and left me with a green screen and sound.  That was it.  My TV was gone after only having it 7 months!!!!!!I thought since I had a warranty on it, they would immediately send another to replace it.  Not so, the process is so slow and tedious I will NEVER BUY ANOTHER TV SET OR ANYTHING MADE BY TCL!!!!!!  First, they want you to send a photo of the problem, (like I have all the time in the world)...then, I had to call them back to find out what was going on...They informed me that I had to wait 6 DAYS for a new part....Then, after I got that, call them back and they would call a Tech to come out and fix it. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WILL BE IN THIS CENTURY OR NOT....I AM AFRAID TO FIND OUT!!!!!!I work in the TV biz and have to stay on top of pop culture....I can't be without a TV that I can tape shows on for 2 Weeks or longer.BOTTOME LINE.....GOOD TV'S JUST DON'T BREAK...THEY LAST FOR A GOOD LONG TIME......DO NOT BUY FROM TCL!!!!!!!", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00851PZ5G"}}
