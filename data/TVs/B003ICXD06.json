{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Solid TV", "Author": "JLaRue", "ReviewID": "RP7X58Q37AJL1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV is gorgeous. The picture is clean and crisp with impressive black levels and viewing angles. The Audio is clear and can get quite loud. I watched different excerpts of the Planet Earth Blu-ray and it looked stunning. A family member came in during a water scene and remarked that it was just like watching from the rails of a cruise ship. I would recommend for gaming that you set the Digital Natural Motion to off to avoid any lag time. The performance of this television with the Xbox360 and PS3 is great. I have connected the television to my computer and was satisfied with the performance. Also, check the Philips support center or connect your TV to the internet and download the most recent firmware for increased performance and updated features.  As a previous reviewer mentioned the NetTV is a little iffy; however, the NetFlix and Twitter services work well. I'm hoping that in the near future there will be a few more updates to maybe get Hulu support. The downside is that the new model of this Television is now for sale at a similar price point, and it offers wireless connectivity out of the box, as well as support to play DivX video via USB. I have been told that it is possible to now purchase a WiFi dongle for this television set from Philips for those would like to connect to the internet wirelessly.  All in all, I would recommend this TV to anyone looking to get above average performance from a relatively large LCD on a budget. It has plenty of connectivity for the average user and the box to setup time is extremely low as the stand is already assembled. I look forward to using this Television for years to come. I can't rate it 5 stars because there are other TVs that have more features, but if I could I would give it a rating of four and a half stars. Amazon does not allow this.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Looks Great & Sounds Great Too!", "Author": "Nicholas Winn \"E-Bike Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "RI4YI95VEJCYI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this Television based on the reviews on Amazon and at Best Buy.This television is quality.Major positive features of this television are;1. The Non Glare Screen.This is not a Led T.V and all the L.E.D. Tvs have the shiny screens so it's very annoying toview them during the day or if you have movement going on in the background. Maybe the shiny screens make theimage look better. But what does that matter if the viewing enjoyment is degraded by the distractions in the background.2. Built in Sound System.Most T.Vs have tinny hollow sounding sound systems and the first thing you have to do is go out and buya surround sound system. This T.V has very good built in sound even at high volumes.3. Weight and thickness. The newest T.Vs are wafer thin and if you bend the screen a little than you have a 55\" Brick.This T.V is a solid 90+ LBS. That could be a positive or a negative depending on how you look at it. In my opinion the extraweight is because of the solid sound system and higher quality components.4. Image and color. Excellent the flesh tones are true to life. While this may be a feature on all T.Vs this T.V will automaticallyadjust the size of the image to the signal coming in. So if you are watching Non HD it will reduce the size of the screen to the originalbroadcast. Also standard definition movies from Vudu look great, I don't know if the T.V enhances them but I've been renting my movies fromVudu in SD and been very happy.Negatives.1. Weight it weighs around 30Lbs more than other 55\" T.V so it's a bear to mount.2. It doesn't have Wifi or internet connectivity built in. This doesn't matter to me because I bought a DVD player with WIFI so I get my  Netflix through my Blue Ray player.3. No 3d, from what I've heard 3d is not perfected yet and the televisions that are 3d do not display 2d very well. So for me 3D is not an issue.ConclusionMy family is very pleased with this T.V. Quality of video and sound is excellent. It was around $100.00 less than the Sony and I feel like thefeatures such as 240hz refresh rate and the quality sound system make it worth $600.00 more than the Sony.They don't sell this T.V at Best Buy anymore but at the time I bought it at Amazon there were many positive reviews on Best Buy and 100% of the people who've purchased it would recommend it to others. I am in agreement with the many who have given this T.V positive ratings it's an excellent value.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Be aware of NetTV limitations in the US", "Author": "Crusher", "ReviewID": "RHEO3GNSM7PBR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall I am ok with this TV. Impressive Picture and Colors. One of the reasons I bought this one was NetTV. In Europe NetTV includes many services as YouTube. Not so in the US. In the US NetTV consists only of the Internet Radio Tuner and the Netflix connection. As per the Customer Service there is not additional Service for NetTV planned. This was a major disapointment. Furthermore in order to upgrade this TV with WiFi you need to buy a Wifi Dongle (PTA01) from Europe. This one is not available in the US and might add up to an additional $100 including shipping. What I currently experience in addition is that the sound from the home theater sytem is slightly behind the picture. Not sure what the reason therefore is and still need to investigate. So, as I said TV is good but with limitations.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV, although I think the 240hz is not a huge +", "Author": "Beauty Junkee", "ReviewID": "RBUKKET9SL4QJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has beautiful color and definition. I do still notice the blur you can get with fast motion, even though this is 240hz, but it is not that distracting. I think this was a fair price. I like the swivel stand that comes already attached, very easy setup, good packaging.

Delivery was kinda screwed up. They confirmed delivery for a friday. I get a call on thursday from the delivery guy. He's sitting in my driveway!

I have the exact same brand and model.  I did have to up my Comcast bit rate but other than that the picture and sound are great. The only downside is that actresses age 10 to 20 years with this detail. It's like going from silence black and white films to IMAX.

We purchased it from a warehouse club.  It was a beautiful tv.  Smart looking. Clean, with piano black details.  Unfortunately, it has a lot of problems.  Philips claims that this is an internet ready tv.  So, why doesn't it consistently connect to the internet.  When you call and talk with Philips, they try to blame it on everything, instead of taking the blame.  First they want to know if its our modem.  \"How far is the modem? What model of modem do you have?  Have you tried to connect directly to the modem?\" \"Oh, we know that your particular modem has a security feature that will not allow our tv's to connect because it doesn't recognize it, and will kick it off.\" Then they want to try and blame Netflix.  \"We've had problems with Netflix, they're always having problems with connections.\"  So we ask, \"why is it that 1)I can connect to the internet with my Dell laptop, access the internet from our home computer, and our son can access the internet with his smartphone, all at the same time, but yet you say that it's either our modem, or Netflix?\"  So, if you're smart, you're steer clear of this model.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "4 HDMI inputs\n240Hz Clear LCD\nNetTV\nPixel Precise HD\nEnergy Star 4.0", "Name": "Philips 55PFL5705D/F7 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz LCD HDTV with NetTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41b7uXpQk-L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003ICXD06"}}
