Setup took maybe 5 minutes, using HDMI hookups for incoming Digital cable, DVD, X-box 360, and Playstation 3.  Took an extra 5 minutes to hard-wire the internet cable, and connect optical audio output to the Home Theatre system.Picture quality is excellent, with the very high contrast ratio....Black is really black, unlike on my 1-year old Sony Bravia2 Million:1 vs 30K:1 contrast ratios).  Didn't really need to do much to optimize the picture quality.  Blue-Ray movies played off the PS3 look awesome. Also found it was easy to adjust the lip-sync for TV sound to make it match the surround sound system.I don't know if the LED lighting is what improves the picture quality or not, but it looks great.The remote is easy to use, but seems to have a flaw, continually telling me that the batteries are almost dead, when they are hours fresh. Fortunately, everything still works just fine.Only reason this review is not 5 stars is the limited choices on internet services.  Would be nice to be able to have a browser for full internet access.  However, Netflix, the main service we use works great.  Have watched a bunch of movies, and the quality is almost always excellent, much better than we used to get using the Netflix app on the XBox 360.I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a good quality, affordable TV.  I can't imagine what more one could get by doubling the cost, as many brands do.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Vizio M70NV review", "Author": "straightreview", "ReviewID": "R3KE098DPNTXEN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received this tv about 2 months ago and here's a list of pros and cons I can come up with.Pros:Picture is very crisp in HDPicture can be viewed from almost 180 degree angle of viewOverall thickness of tv is amazing, less than 2\"Internet appsCons:Tv remote will not work anymore, it had problems after about 3 or 4 days. The problem initially was that sometimes the keys on the top of the remote would not work, and then every now and then they would. After 2 months, the remote is completely out of commission. I can no longer use the Internet Apps, the Tv must be turned off manually from the side, and sometimes that does not work. If I'm watching Netflix the button on the side of the Tv will not work. So the only way to turn the Tv off is to unplug it. I called Vizio customer service and spoke with a tech and I went through all the unique troubleshooting techniques that they instruct. Still nothing worked so they are sending a new remote.Other problems I have with this product is that the internet apps could be improved. The Showtime app is very limited as is some of the others. I really wish you could browse the net with an app such as google.The sound from the tv is not very impressive at all.In all honesty after reading about 10 other similar reviews, I would probably look past this product, and look for something of higher quality and maybe better reviews.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "I THINK... I LOVE THIS TV", "Author": "Joshau L. Urovitch \"joshuaboston\"", "ReviewID": "R116LP3YF3VJLZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, so this review is based on ownership for one week. TV was VERY easy to set up and to hook up to our wireless G network (there is NO benefit from having a wireless N network), it is all about the speed of your internet and has nothing to do with the speed of your network since the internet speed will be the bottleneck, DSL will probably be to slow, the internet app VUDU said I should download movies in 1080P. The Bluetooth remote control that came with the TV controls our cable box (Comcast - Motorola), the remote is AMAZING!!! Net flick looks AMAZING!!! The other internet features are pretty good. I HOPE that the hulu deal that Vizio has done will be playable with this TV. The picture looks awesome!!! BUT there is better technology out there and local dimming is supposed to give you a better picture but it is more expensive. While watching the Home Network (house hunters) I did notice some blue bleeding from the top left corner, I am not sure if it was filmed that way or was the fault of the TV because I did not notice this blue bleeding any other time. Blacks look great, but I don't have twenty TV's next to mine to point out that another TV has better blacks, this TV has a 1:1,000,000 contrast ratio and I am very happy with the picture. I have not played much with the picture options, so the settings that come with the TV are pretty GREAT. I am also happy with the sound; yes there is no bass... its TV speakers.OK, the TV looks Amazing in standard definition (I was very surprised because usually standard def does not look good with these new 1080P TV's) and High definition. I only watched a preview in 1080P through the internet with VUDU (did not want to spend the $$$ to watch more) and the TV looked amazing. I do not have a blue ray player since I don't like to spend $$$ and I just signed up for Netflix, so I did not even watch a DVD to experiment with. I did not try over the air HDTV, I live in NH where we only get 4 channels and two of them SUCK...lol.OK, now for the problems. While playing around with the remote, I some how got the TV to freeze within the first 5 hours of ownership. Had to call Vizio (was upgraded to a level three tec), they told me how to reset the firmware by pressing down on the power button on the TV for 30 seconds, but first unplug all cables (this took about 45 minutes). Since then the TV has worked flawless. I thought that there would be a feature that would UPGRADE the firmware... you know... since it is able to hook up to the internet, but I could not find it :(... don't know if this is good or bad. The TV has three USB plugs that do not work, it is suppose to work later on when Vizio fixes their firmware (even though I don't see how it is possible to upgrade it)... so I have read online... I am not to worried, but it would be a nice feature to be able to plug in a usb thumb drive and watch an avi file... personally I would much rather have Hulu going and CANCEL my cable service (this is a dream of mine...lol)OK...I now own this TV for 4 months... the freezing has never stopped, even after a firmware update (that is controlled by Vizio). Every other day when I turn on the TV it freezes... mostly in HD stations but it has also happened when I was plugged in my laptop and sometimes in SD channels I can tell that it is just about to freeze. Mostly freezes when I turn the TV on, when it does happens I hold the power button for thirty seconds... it usually turns off but the vizio flashes so I have to hold it again for thirty seconds then it finally turns on usually normally but every once in a while I would have to do this whole thing twices... could be a five minute affair.I have called Vizio to fix the problem, I have an appointment this Tuesday, two people are coming to my home, they tell me that they are changing the main board and the power supply. I hope this fixes the problem.My sister has the 42\" TRUE LED and she is having problems with her remote control. I have another 32\" Vizio... purchased a refurbished 1080P model about three years ago for $350 and it has not given me one problem.I still love the picture quality and I would still buy a new Vizio TV... so far...lol. I a glutton for punishment.OK... This is the THIRD FOLLOW UP. From my phone conversation with Vizo, they have decided to change out the MAIN BOARD and the POWER SUPPLY. This was done about two - three weeks ago. Now, the TV runs PERFECT. Has not freezed once, it is a LOT more snappy when I turn it on. What bothers me the most is that I thought I loved this TV even though it would freeze up so often and that I ignored the problem for so long... like I said it would freeze every day or every other day and sometimes twice a day.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent value, great picture!", "Author": "Deanb", "ReviewID": "RJP94TVKSJUJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had purchased a lower-end Samsung and was frustrated by it's \"auto-smoothing\" feature since there was no way to turn it off.

I take my hat off to Vizio, they did an excellent job creating a really quality product.  The TV was easy to unpack and set up. I used a Flat panel stand and it fit perfectly to the mounting hardware without having to jury rig anything. The inputs and outputs are clearly marked and the setup guide is simple to figure out. I went into the TV settings to adjust the color and contrast settings to my liking, but the default wasn't bad either.Haven't had a chance to play too much with the Internet apps, but the ones I have tried seem to work well. I expected a larger selection but the network piece was a simple setup.  Only drawback is I keep getting a message that the batteries are low on the remote and with the slide out keyboard on it - it isn't very ergonomic.

The LED/LCD is much better than a standard LCD.  The sound is OK but not as good as my older Sony 40\" XBR series.

I have used the weather application and the TV guide application.  We have a Sony Google TV attached as the Blue Ray player and it is much better.  If you want a much better internet experience the google TV is the answer.Please note that this TV is only 2 months old so I can not comment on the long term quality / durability.

I have only one complaint:  At times the TV will update rendering it useless for anywhere from 5 to 20+ min.  It would be nice if yu had the option to delay the update until you finish yiour show.

The TV has an excellent picture, and it's fairly easy to use. I would caution potential buyers if they are buying it for the Internet apps.

The TV experienced problems after 5 days of operation.

After spending several days researching solutions on the internet and emailing and phoning the tech support folks without being able to resolve the problem, I decided to return the set. I was unwilling to devote any more time to resolving a technical problem on my brand-new TV.Pro's: set-up was very easy, wireless internet connection, internet apps, many pre-set display modes (standard, football, basketball, golf,movies ,etc.)  Picture quality was very good. Sound sync with closeups of people speaking was good ... no noticeable gaps.Con's: (other than not working) ... audio quality from LED TV's, this one included is not great, probably because of how thin the cabinet is. Mine was hooked up to a home theater system, so that wasn't a real concern for me. The included remote is promoted as being able to replace your other remotes, and did control my PVR, but it did not recognize a Sony DVD players at all.

One (hopefully minor) flaw!", "Author": "Xtofer \"sixdotzeroseven\"", "ReviewID": "RI1P294NFGA54", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this tv for about 2 weeks now. I like almost everything about this tv, including the internet apps. I'm completely satisfied with just using Netflix, Facebook and Twitter. If I needed anything else, I'd just go to my computer or use my PS3.That said, there have been a few occasions where the TV will shut itself off and reboot. This is the one glaring flaw that I see about the TV. It doesn't happen all the time, but only sporadically and unpredictably. Because I wasn't sure if I wanted to return the tv or not, I went ahead and contacted Vizio. I was told that there's something in the latest firmware update that causes the TV to shut itself down and reboot. It has to do with correcting any potential errors. The rep from Vizio said that this is a known issue and that the next firmware update should solve the problem.However, he wasn't able to give me an ETA on when the next firmware update will be, and said it will be \"soon\".Pros:-47\" LED LCD 1080P/120hz with internet apps, a Bluetooth wireless remote for under $800. It's unlikely you'll find another TV with a comparable set of features for that price. Not impossible, but unlikely.-\"Slide-out\" QWERTY keyboard on the remote is a nice convenient feature.-Wireless N connection for optimal wireless speed is a plus (makes Netflix better to use on the TV than with the PS3).-Picture quality is pretty much amazing in full 1080p. Even 720p video games look amazing.Cons:-As has been said before, the audio quality is not great. It's just okay. Also, and this is just personal preference, I don't like the auto-gain setting set to \"on\" for the audio. I think it diminishes the sound quality, especially in video games when there are several sounds that are louder or softer depending on what you do. All of this will be easily resolved with a soundbar or other sound system, which I plan on getting.-The TV shutting off randomly is annoying. It hasn't happened enough to get me to a breaking point yet (which is still very possible -- I'll update this review if it does), but I'm very hopeful that this is just a minor flaw that will not be an issue with the next firmware update.In conclusion, If you have money to spend and want to invest in an amazing TV, I would suggest looking elsewhere, but if you're like me and you live on a budget and need value over anything else, then I believe this is the best bang for your buck.::UPDATE:: 11-30-11The TV has not shut itself off since a firmware patch was applied a couple months ago.

For some reason this tv thinks it should decide when to update the firmware and seems to require the TV to be on to do so.  In other words the TV will shut down periodically and will not turn back on for up to 30 minutes.  You might think the good folks at Vizio would keep this in mind and not release updates in the middle of the super bowl or during sweeps week, you would be wrong.Vizio logo is lit all the time.  When the TV is off it is Orange when on it is bright white.  When watching TV in the dark or low light levels I find this extremely annoying.  I know LED's use only a little power but does the TV really need to draw that power 24/7 even when the TV is off?  I know what TV I bought I do not need the constant reminder.No YouTube app.  I didn't think this mattered but friends try and pull up youtube content all the time during parties.  Most of the \"smart tvs\" out there seem to have this feature go with one of them.  If you have it you may never use it but if you don't you might be as surprised as I have been.No browser.  See above.There are plenty of smart TVs on the market I would suggest looking for one that will not update at random (mostly to add features for Apps you won't use like a random catholic school) and has YouTube and a web browser.

That was $300 less than the Walmart a couple of miles away. So, it was time to treat myself. When I got it home, my wife said, \"Why didn't you get a Sony?\" My reply, \"Because, I'm an Electrical Engineer and know a lot more about TVs than you.\"Other than price, the most attractive feature of this set was that it would power from both 120 and 240 VAC, and as I intended to take it overseas with me this fall, that feature was pretty important.

WiFi enabled being a big plus", "Author": "Rick Eads", "ReviewID": "R1ZN14CSM0AFLU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've had this TV for a bit over a month.  We purchased it at Costco as they had a promotion going and were actually anticipating buying a smaller TV given the budget we'd allocated for the purchase.  When we saw this 47\" Vizio, my wife's first question was \"what's wrong with it?  How come this one is so much cheaper?\"  We pulled the various reviews posted online and noted there were some exceptions to blissful happiness which gave us some concerns but thought we'd buy it anyway as the price differential between the M470NV and similar models from Sony and Samsung was hard to ignore (on the order of $500 at the time).We brought the unit home and fired it up.  Boot time was a little long but we soon had it up and running.  I was anxious to try out the built-in internet connectivity and was able to immediately connect to our wireless access point and the TV easily supported the WPA encryption being used by the AP.  We have a simple 1MBit DSL connection and this works well with Netflix at both the low and medium bandwidth levels.  At the higher bandwidth (1-2GB/hr), the Netflix application widget will not connect reliably to the Netflix server.  The medium level of quality though is certainly satisfactory for me and at least as good as broadcast HD in most all cases observed.  I will note that it took me a while to figure out that adjusting the playback quality on my Netflix account was required before the Netflix app on the TV would work reliably with all movies.  There are also reports from some that indicate a need to change DNS server settings manually to 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4 (Google DNS servers) in order to sync the TV with your Netflix account.  I did not have that particular issue so this maybe a function of which ISP your are using and or your Router/AP configuration.  All-in-all though, having the TV connect wirelessly is quite novel in my opinion.The remote is very functional and it is nice to have access to a full QWERTY keyboard simply by sliding out the keyboard from the lower half of the remote.  Also, the remote supports Bluetooth which means you do not need to point it at the TV in order for it to work.  The remote is black in color and I'd like it better if it was backlit but that would be a minor enhancement.The picture quality seems excellent to me.  I have thought for a long time that CRT's have produced a better, overall picture for non-HD content (as most TV source material produced to date is not HD).  On this TV I must say that both HD and non HD sources appear excellent, rivaling the best picture quality CRT monitors ever produced in terms of contrast, color resolution, and the lack of digital compression artifacts in the image.I would thus rate this TV as a definite buy.  After 30 days of daily use we are very pleased with it.  It appears like it offers a lot of value for the money and it does.

We were excited to see that the price dropped to $949 for the week of Thanksgiving, which made it an even better deal!!!Straight out of the box, setup was a breeze.  There is an integrated intro that halps you connect all of the peripherals and connect to your home's wireless internet.  I loved the fact that it came with an internal Wi-Fi receiver, which saved us about $100 dollars if we had gone with a different brand.The picture and sound are superb.  I am really impressed with the different styles of picture to choose from (i.e. movie, football, gaming, etc.).  Also, the picture style changes automatically depending on which peripheral you are using (to gaming when using the PS3, movie when using the DVD player)The only concern that I had right off was the quality of the remote.  It's a slide QWERTY model, similar to phones with the same feature.  Just like some phones out there, the joints that hold the two parts of the remote together seem a little loose.  Thankfully, we don't use the QWERTY that often, so I don't think this will be a problem.Another feature that we enjoy is the apps.  We have used the Netflix and Pandora apps every day, and enjoy the interface on both.Overall, I have nothing but great things to say about this model, and recommend it to everyone who is looking for a good TV with Internet capability and apps.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very nice tv set.

So over the past 4 years I viewed and really got to appreciate HDTV.When my family moved to a larger home, I had the added bonus of getting my own office. A place to make my own when I have a spare 40 minutes once a week. As part of the \"man cave\" I needed to have a TV (of course) so I went online and shopped for the newest technology and features available.I looked into 3D and was less than impressed, and honestly see this as a fad that will end after people get sick of wearing special goggles and figure out that getting laser eye surgery so you can watch television in 3D wasn't that great of an idea.After a long month of shopping for the best deal and features combination I again chose the Vizio. It was great the 1st time around, so I gave them another shot. Only problem was that the TV had very little ratings because it was a new model.After living with this TV for the past 6 months I can say with surety; Internet TV is a great idea, and this vizio makes the apps that I use easily available.I am a Prime Member and free streaming of media is a super perk.The wireless setup is as easy as connecting your cell phone or laptop to wireless.Picture is 240 htz refresh HDTV A+++  Might be too detailed, try watching something like Star Wars episode II, you can tell the set is a set.Price best for the TV classWall Mounting was cheap and easy.Remote is very easy to use; QWERTY keyboard make internet searching easy.The only thing that could improve my TV experience; buying another one to replace my 2007 model (and I will when it quits).", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful screen!", "Author": "Z.

Putting it on WiFi was great.TV was easy to ship.  Shipping through Amazon was pretty easy but do not expect it to come until a week after purchase.  I was ok with that because I purchased the TV prior to me traveling for business so I timed it.  I did the cost check because (at the time) Walmart was $20 more + Tax but with Amazon what it says is what you pay.  I do also have Amazon Prime so I didn't pay shipping.The only thing that is a little upsetting is the lack of Internet Apps.  There are like 100 but the ones that come on the TV are great.

To be succinct, the Vizio M470NV product did not come close to living up to  advertisement of being an excellent American product.  Two weeks after my warranty expired, I called Vizio and informed them that my video would intermittently cutoff.  I would have audio but only a black screen.  I was told to reset the TV which I did. The results were the same.We tried to reset the television (clear memory), per instructions by vizio, but after viewing for a while the video screen goes black.  Turn power off and it plays for a while and then the screen goes black again.  Also, I own two other Vizio Televisions and have not had a problem in five years.  Vizio sold me a Lemon!!Since my Vizio was out of warranty by two weeks, I was referred to Indusys Technology Inc. (ITI) for needed repairs.  I paid ITI $325.00 for the repair in which they said my problem was common to Vizio HDTV products.On the first service visit by Vizio preferred  repair company, the technician replaced the board that controlled the video and this was to fix my problem.  It did not!  I called ITI and scheduled a second repair visit. ITI replaced the video board again and the Vizio HDTV failed again.  I call the technician  to schedule a third visit and was told that my HDTV was not repairable (a lemon).I'm aware of Vizio warranty limitation, but normally one should expect a Vizio product of this \"quality\" and \"price\" to function properly at a minimum four or five years with normal utilization.  Pitifully, this Vizio television falls far short of the quality merchandise that I was hoping to receive from the Vizio product line.  This television became dysfunctional at the end of second year of ownership!I have no problems paying for repairs that are out of warranty no matte how close to the two years.  But this product is a lemon and can not be repaired.  The HDTV was not damaged and look like a new TV; no signs of wear!I wrote Vizio a letter letting them know that they sold me a un-repairable product.  This is quite different from a product that is two weeks past warranty, but a product that can not be fixed.  Imagine you purchasing a new car and  two weeks after the warranty expires, the engine dies.  Well it not under warranty, so you purchase a new engine.  Supposed you were told that the car could not accept a new engine and it's un-repairable.  The car, otherwise is in perfect condition, but you can't put an engine in it.  Do you go out and purchase a new car or does the manufacture have some obligation to correct this issue?It is not disputed that my two-year old Vizio HDTV is a lemon and can not be repaired.  With this information, Vizio makes me the following offers:Offer A.)  Vizio will pay half of the repair bill.  This comes out to $152.50.  This does nothing for me because I still have a 47 inch Vizio HDTV that is non-functional and can not be repaired.Offer B.)  Vizio will send me another Vizio HDTV for $510.00.  Well, adding the $325.00 cost for ITI repairs and the additional $510.00 for another almost new HDTV, I would be paying $835.00 for a HDTV that Costco sell currently for $699.00Now, I'm most willing to pay for the Product repair cost of $325.00.  My Vizio HDTV is out of warranty (two-weeks), however this television  can not be repaired.  It's a throw away and Vizio wants me  to purchase  another one of their products?  Would you throw away your car and purchase a new one from the same company?  This is clearly an manufacturing issue. This product should be repairable.Vizio sold me a lemon and could care less about customer satisfaction.  Do not be fooled my their marketing of customer support.  While trying to resolve this issue, my calls were dropped over and over again.  Vizio manager promised to return my calls and never did.The  Vizio representative was not flexible or compassionate to my product dissatisfaction. Product information is as follows:. Purchase 9/2010 at Costco. Model Number:  M470NV 47 Inch.  Problem:  Screen goes black and only volume is on (no picture)If Vizio had told me that their  television product(s) would have problems within two years, then of course I would purchase another brand.  This Vizio HDTV was clearly a lemon and the manufacture, Vizio acknowledged  that the product was a lemon; then proceeded to try and sell me another product.  This is an un-repairable product, but the manufacturer takes no responsibility!  If you own a Vizio product and you have a reasonable complaint, Vizio is not the customer sensitive company you might expect.

For the amount of money this TV costs, and all the problems with firmware, remote controls, and the main board going out of it, you would think VIZIO would correct the problems.

I was looking for and LED tv that had the most bang for my buck, and vizio tvs offered just that. Considering that this same size led with similar features from the major brands cost over 1000, getting this one for 900 was a great deal. The picture so far has been great, but thats probably because I dont have many hd gadgets other thanks my ps3. Then again, thats why I didnt want to spend so much on a tv.

The tv was easy to setup and get running.Pros: Great picture, easy to set up, a vast array of video options.Cons: POOR sound quality( when i first hooked it up i put pandora on, my wife who is as far from a techie as possible, commented on the sound quality) after about a month and a half of use, I come home from to see my tv has decided it doesn't want to say on. After about 24 seconds the screen will freeze(with video content) or flash purple(no video, static) then turn off. The light doesn't flash it just turns off. The remote feels cheap and flimsy and wouldn't control my DVR correctly. As for the internet.... I bought this model in opposed to the other set without wifi with hopes that i could use my server, well that didn't work. I did watch a movie on vudu, which froze up 4-5 times during playback but on a good note it looked amazing!Conclusion: If vizio had put a little more effort into the quality of this TV it would be a great buy.

The third TV has worked great and looks great...so far.  Amazon has been a delight through the multiple returns of this high-end product and we couldn't be more satisfied with Amazon.

Audio quality is unknown, as sound gets routed to real speakers.Unfortunately, we have to deduct 2 stars for Worthless Wireless.  Netflix streams fine over CAT6.  It would probably do the same over the wireless connection -- if it could connect.Problem number one:  MAC filtering.  The setup leads you directly into the Internet programming, which must be aborted in order to get the MAC address from the manual setup screen.  This is in no way an intuitive or obvious process.  There goes a half hour of blundering and fiddling.  There goes half a star.Problem number two:  SSID is turned off.  Wireless setup brings up several screens, filled with every other wireless on the block.  Eventually, you find the page to enter your SSID and password.  Then you get one shot to discover and connect.  Otherwise, you start over.  There goes another hour of blundering and fiddling.
