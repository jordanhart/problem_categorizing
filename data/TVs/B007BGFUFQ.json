The sound sucks but if you have your own sound system then it won't matter. Its a tft display so don't expect a high gloss display. It also has a poor viewing angle but head on it looks wonderful. Dark blacks rich color when viewed head on. It's once again TFT so it has a limited viewing angle but when hooked up to a computer via hdmi it makes a wonderful 1080 display. Text is clearly defined being tft (the perk).So to recap. Bad sound, limited viewing angle. Good colors and blacks, nice design, large screen, great as a computer monitor with solid text reproduction.

The same TV was marked down to the original price here on a different site.  Setting up the TV was easy, the menu is easy to work with.  My only hang up with this is it takes some time to power on and power off.  When I started using the TV I would end up hitting the power button a few times because I didn't think it took the first time.  Then I'd watch it respond and wonder if it was coming on or off.  Turning it off is a bit quicker with a popup that tells you it's shutting down.  (thanks)  I switched over to a universal remote and it seems to work better at turning it on.  I know the universal remote is better at sending signals to devices.Over all I think it's a great TV.

I think I read someone stating that the view angle sucks. That couldn't be more further from the truth. If you can see the screen, you can see a picture. There is no \"black\" shading to it. I was watching TV in my apartment while cooking in the kitchen and the angle was extreme because it faces a side wall. View angle is better than most. It also pivots on the base that comes with it.As far as options on the TV goes, it's pretty standard. One flaw it has is that if you run an external display like a laptop via HDMI (computer screen on TV), it will play the picture and the sound on the TV, but it won't transfer that sound to a Home Theatre System. You have to run a 3.5mm cord from the headphone jack to the Theatre system. Not a biggy as you already have the HDMI cord going across the room, but it would be nice to see upgraded circuitry.

It's a cheap tv for a reason and its not worth the $20-100 savings from not getting  a good brand.  The remote does not turn the tv on fast - the delay is several seconds - several long seconds.  As a result it is hard to turn on the television because you do not know if you hit the on or if its just the Coby acting up.  As  a result you have to turn on the television three or four times before you succeed.  Changing channels is the same. The delay is extremely frustrating.  TV and Sound are ok.  Sound is a bit muffled but not bad for a cheap tv.  There is a blue light that is lit whenever the television is powered off.  It is extremeely bright.  Therefore, if you want this television in the bedroom or somewhere where lights are not wanted, I would not recommend it.  The light illuminates the whole bedroom and is a bright spotlight.

My experience has been with the budget models--in the $3-400 price range and the under 40-inch screens. I currently own the \"Coby TFTV3925,\" and the similarly priced TCL L40FHDF12TA and \"TCL L32HDF11TA\" (now discontinued).The Coby is easy to set up, and once you free it from its box it is pretty much plug-and-play. I fiddled around with the features for awhile. In my experience, all of the features are fun, but they rarely do anything to enhance the viewing experience. Just little technological toys to play with.All of these TVs are pretty similar in picture quality. The Coby is a bit larger--39 inches vs. 32 inches for my other TVs. The extra size isn't all that noticeable, but every inch counts in TV size, right?  I used by BluRay player and compared the visual quality of the three TVs. To my untrained and non-expert eye I didn't notice any differences. The \"TCL 12TZ\" boasts \"enhanced image quality\" but I am putting that down to marketing.  The all look great, with a nice, sharp picture, and the Coby gets the edge for having a larger size.Sound is where the Coby takes a hit.  It has noticeably lower sound quality than either of the TCL models.  To be honest, none of them have great sound--this isn't usually a problem as I have a 5.1 surround sound system so I rarely rely on the TV speakers, but if you don't have any stereo back-up you are going to find the Coby hard to listen too. I think you are going to want to use some of the money you save to buy some back-up speakers.The Coby is cheaper than either of the TLC models, and that is huge. Honestly, I am willing to sacrifice a little quality for a bargain, and I think you get that with the Coby. To me, the picture is more important than the sound, and on that the Coby delivers. Plus, I like the few extra inches you can buy for cheaper than either of the TCL TVs.After the comparison, the Coby took the honored spot in the living room, while the TLC 11TA got demoted to the guest room. This isn't a perfect TV. If you are expecting to get high-end quality for low-end price, then you are going to be disappointed. But if you are realistic about what you are buying, I think you will be perfectly happy. You would be hard pressed to find another TV that gives you as much value for your dollar. And inches.

Risk! My first one arrived damaged, not doubt by the delivery man. I wasn't impressed with the packaging from the factory though. The second one works just fine. Thanks to amazon I had no issues returning the defective unit or getting the new one. All headaches were UPS related. I've had it running for a little over 3 months now with no issues. I like the set a lot but I'm thinking it's a bit over priced currently.Sound:All sorts of awful. Too quiet for some sources. Always hallow, tinny and murky. No low end whatsoever. Hook up an amp and some speakers to this thing and go forth knowing you have done what needed to be done. A switched RCA out for audio would have made that simpler but then its less then 300 bucks. Digital out is good, but I'm pretty sure it will not output your analog audio sources should you have them. Never tried, but I don't think it has that kind of A to D conversion capability. If I was designing this TV I wouldn't put that in.Picture:Not bad. Blacks aren't super black and off angle (especially from above) is poor. What do you expect for 3 bills on a TFT? I own worse, but I also own better. This set will not knock you off your feet. For less then $300 it's a monster though. Which brings us to the next point.Value:It's $400ish right now. I'm sure you can do better if it's at the $400 price point. Coby has a LED 39\" for about $320 on Amazon right now. Go shop around. $400 is at least a hundy too much for me!

She also called Amazon who told her that there was nothing they could do as it was outside of the 30 return policy window and the manufacturer's responsibility.  It's become a source of stress because she has no idea if and when they will send her a repair or replacement, and since she will be away for the summer -- unable to receive deliveries -- it may be returned to the sender, never to be seen again.

Still, I paid for a working remote control, so I'd like one. Emailed Coby and told them the problem. They tell me to send them a money order and they'd send me a new remote! Huh? What about a warranty? That's their way of handling a problem on their part. Instead of owning up and taking care of the customer, they lose one forever.

First Shipment Was Broken!", "Author": "PhoenixOnPoint", "ReviewID": "R2FRQCVALIF0KU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was highly annoyed to find that the very first TV I received was broken.  I went through the trouble of unpacking it, setting up all the connections, etc.; then when I turned it facing forward and removed the final thin sheet of foam from the screen and turned it on ... there were spider webs and a glow. It was a pain to repack, deal with Amazon customer support in another country (bad phone connection), then wait another two days for another TV to come.  Shipping was already delayed due to the holiday.On the second TV, the sound seems not as good as the first for whatever reason, unless I just don't remember correctly, so I'm unsure if I got a somewhat faulty unit.  Not returning this one.  In any event, the sound DOES SUCK -- all the reviews are correct.I expected the sound to be subpar when I purchased this, so I'm not very surprised. However, I thought the other reviewers were just being too critical/picky, or expected movie theater quality sound. I thought, \"Surely it can't be that bad.\"It is.I'm definitely getting a surround sound system when I can afford it.  Admittedly, I'm a bit spoiled, having moved from a Toshiba rear projection with amazing surround sound simulation and theater quality sound. However, the sound is tinny on this TV, as others have said.  Imagine listening to a movie through those old-school foam-covered personal headphones that you used to use with a Walkman. Now imagine if you're sitting next to someone blasting music through their Walkman speakers. THAT is how this TV sounds -- like you're that \"external listener,\" getting a taste of someone else's music from a few seats away.I tried using one speaker more than the others, as suggested as a \"fix\" by one online reviewer for this TV, but didn't notice any improvement at all.  I've played with all the sound settings available, using the preset ones (Theater, News, Standard, etc.), then trying a \"Custom\" combo of my own -- sound still wack.How's the picture? I can't comment on its potential there, as I don't have HD cable nor an HD or Blueray DVD player. Is the sound wackness enough to leave this TV on its virtual shelf?  Negative. I got this for a very good deal near Black Friday 2012 ($240) to replace our 46\" living room TV that died. This TV would be better in a bedroom or smaller room, but I think it's worth the purchase. Just prepare to eventually channel the sound to a more capable system.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "@$249 It can't be beat!", "Author": "Simon Clement", "ReviewID": "R2EO8JVGCU7PXY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this HDTV for my home office.

Also the colors can be a little off depending on what i have hooked up but you can adjust them.Because of the bad sound/lack of audio out and the RARE times the image is a little off, i give it 4 stars.

I saw another review online that described the speakers as \"tin cans\" and that about sums it up.Furthermore, and the DEATH KNELL for this TV-- there is NO AUDIO OUT, whatsoever! Which means, if you want to hook up any kind of better speaker system to it (which I definitely did)-- YOU CAN'T.No headphone jack, no red/white audio out (i thought there was, but there isn't).
