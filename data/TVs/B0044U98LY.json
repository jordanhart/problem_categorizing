Was told by Sanyo that it was the board and would cost upwards of $600.00 to replace. Since it was out of warranty they would do nothing to help me. This is a very common fault. Search it out.

We just dealt with it for awhile, but tonight my husband & I read TONS of reviews about other Sanyo TV's doing the same thing, & worse - turning off & staying off & not working at all!  I saw this & read it to my husband who said, \"At least we don't have that problem.\"  Minutes later, we did.  Our TV just turned off & won't go on anymore.  NEVER buying anything Sanyo again, and I cannot believe they do not care anything at all for their brand name.  Don't believe me?  Just Google Sanyo TV problems, you'll see thousands of complaints, with NO response or help from Sanyo.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "WARNING - BUYER BEWARE", "Author": "Arrf", "ReviewID": "R1BL8HJSUF59SD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Google Sanyo TV problems.

No issues at all I can honestly say... purchased at the WAL store but that makes no difference.  There may be bad reviews for this TV but mine's been perfect (knock on wood).  Now I did purchase a Polaroid 47\" before this one... and it DID have all the same issues that others describe here for the this TV.  One thing I learned was that these TV's are all made in China (you get what you pay for) and the boards on them are meant to go out after a certain time.  They all have 1-piece boards of course, and it costs 4x the price of the TV to replace.  not worth it.  For the polaroid however, if you opened it up and checked for bad capacitors (swollen ones) you can replace them with slightly higher capacitors and that fixes the problem 75% of the time.  If it's just going to the garbage you might as well open it up and see if you have bad capacitors!  Search on polaroid and capacitor to find the issue and description of the fix.  But this Sanyo is doing just fine after 4 years :)", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "ljm", "ReviewID": "R2TC0F7I8VD83H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv in early Dec.In the three months I,ve been watching it I,ve had zero problems with it.It was easy to set up,and has all the connections I needed to use HDMI and my older DVD recorder,as well as,plugging it into my stereo.The price was great,too.I don't play video games on my TV,so I can't say how that would look.So,in short,I love this TV and whole-heartedly recommend it .", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Sanyo DP46849 46\" 1080p LCD HDTV w/ ATSC Tuner, 3 HDMI and 2 Component - MFG Refurbished", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dUvkBvsML._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0044U98LY"}}
