{"Reviews": [{"Title": "TV Convience", "Author": "Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"", "ReviewID": "R3G6VLZZ3NSTHY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With the upcoming years in electronics coming up, the whole television signal will be completely changed from the traditional NTSC analog, to the ATSC signal, many people don't know which kind of a television to buy. Although it is tough, many people can't afford the HDTV's, many are considering EDTV's, and SDTV's instead. Sylvania does know that feeling for all consumers. They've definitely made some of the best quality electronics on the market, and still bring out the best that is affordable. This television does bring out that theory well for anyone who wants a new television.The Sylvania LD200SL8 is a 20 inch LCD television is a lightweight and convient DTV to buy, at a affordable price. The television is easy to setup and easy to operate. At a lightwieght 17 pounds, it is easy to place on your entertainment center, or hang on your television mount. The television also is sleek, and includes a DVD player that works well. It is compatable to nearly all DVD playback compatablities. It is capable of playing DVD+/-RW discs in Video mode only (not VR mode as the case with Sylvania's DVD recorders), MP3 CD's and traditional CD's. The sound really is great to listen to in crisp dolby digital sound for your favorite movies and television shows. The display is delightful and looks great, and elequently well for your cable box, as well video game systems like the Playstation 3 or Xbox 360. There is one disadvantage, you can't change the screen from 16x9 widescreen, unless you have a HD converter box or antenna.All in all, the Sylvania LD200SL8 is a great TV/DVD combo at an affordable price for those who trust Sylvania, and for anybody on a budget. I really like Sylvania's brands of electronics, and I really recommend this for anyone who wants to change with the times, but not strectch so much out of the price.Price: B+Convience: B+Easy To Use: B 1/2+DVD Playback: BOverall: B 1/2+", "Date": "May 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "good product, good price.", "Author": "C.

It has a built in dvd player, which unforturnately will not play jpeg files (I overlooked that).  I would probably have bought it anyway due to the price.  It also has analog and digital tuners built in.  Those and the dvd were very important to me.  The picture is very good for a bedroom or other small tv type placement.  When using an antenna, the digital channels do not follow the corresponding analog channel, they are grouped after all analog channels.  That was kind of irritating, but not too bad.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "A fabulous little TV for a den or anyone on a budget", "Author": "Larry VanDeSande", "ReviewID": "RGE5LNMJOD5VI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sylvania's 20-inch \"ED\"TV with built-in DVD player is a winner. I bought one when I wanted to upgrade our second TV to high definition at the same time I bought our 37-inch Olevia for our living room (ASIN: B000H312RK see my review) and this is turning out to be the best $1,000 I ever spent.The little Sylvania is an \"enhanced definition\" television. This means it is not true high definition but can accept the high def signal although it won't interpret it exactly as your true HDTV will. But it looks great even in standard definition with an exceptionally bright screen that delivers brilliant colors and high contrast all the time.The 20-inch (diagonal) screen is 16 inches wide and 12 inches deep, giving it a 4:3 picture ratio. This is not HD widescreen but it looks wider than that when you watch. Part of the reason for that is the super brilliance of the picture mated to the enhanced definition picture.The built-in DVD player is on the back left side of the TV on a vertical plane. It's easy to use -- just stick in your favorite DVD and press \"play\". This is a friendly little television you'll like.", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent purchase", "Author": "Denise M.

Paul", "ReviewID": "R38NWHM6ENBR7J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased my Sylvania TV/DVD combo about 18 months ago in September 2007. The unit itself has worked fine up to this point. The problem is with the remote. Around a month ago, one button ceased to work. Since then, the remote has been gradually losing functionality. I am convinced that this problem is not a result of anything that I have done since I treat my electronics with great care and this unit is not used by any children. The worst part at this point is that I cannot turn down the volume on the TV using the remote. Let's face it; these days many TVs just aren't completely functional without a fully working remote and even if they are, who really wants to get up and go to the TV to change the channel or volume. I know I am lazy but admit it, you are probably the same way, right? Actually, in this situation, it would be more than just inconvenient for me to have to use the buttons on my TV. I use it in my bedroom and, without going into details (because it would be boring), it just isn't feasible.I have tried to fix the remote myself with no luck. I am pretty handy at fixing things and have worked on everything from cars to appliances to home electronics. I have tried contacting Sylvania customer service for help but they tell me that they cannot do anything except sell me a new remote for $25. I am not going to give them anymore of my money for a remote which I fully expect to quit working just as this one has. They were pleasant enough, but ultimately unwavering in their \"policies\".I will never buy from Sylvania again or for that matter, Funai. Funai is the company behind the Sylvania name.My advice to you is to spend a little more money to get a better TV that also includes a better quality remote. I have never regretted buying any of Sony's products and none of their remotes have ever crapped out on me. As for the TV itself, it is still working but who knows how long that will last. I am not very optimistic at this point.Update, Feb 10, 2012:The TV still works fine. I guess I would say it is just as good as the day we got it. I bought a refurb Harmony remote to replace the original and it works fine.", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "piece of junk", "Author": "Joseph Lombarde \"Joe Lum\"", "ReviewID": "R2OXV6WR44HCAT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Recieved this TV as a Christmas present 2007.
