{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HU9000 Vs HU8550", "Author": "Shopping Guru", "ReviewID": "R3JM5P75GKLZ2I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "** I will be constantly updating this as i get more information**[Updated: May 16, 2014]--------------Update 5/16/14:Now that i have my HU9000 TV, my fear has been realized. Earlier in my longer review i mentioned i got to test the TV in home mode and noticed the picture looked less sharp and a bit washed out with colors not as rich. I thought it may have been their wiring/settings, etc. Well it is less sharp, colors not as rich and any light hitting this thing washes out the pic. This is viewing cable and will test other media later. So far i am not as impressed as i was in store. I also discovered that only the MHL HDMI port has HDCP 2.2 support. I will verify if ARC has it too. You will need HDCP 2.2 if you connect any 4K device that requires copy protection handshake. Also any text across the screen like news tickers are curved. this is a bit strange and perhaps will get use to it in time. I need to play around with settings and do some calibrating and will report back soon. Only had this thing 2 days. There are way too many settings that effect PQ. They really need to make this simple. That whitish logo light on the middle front can be turned off. I sure hope further home testing/calibrating gives me back that wow factor.-----------------------ORIGINAL POST:Here is some information I have collected from my personally odyssey into the complex world of Ultra HD (UHD)/ 4K and my extensive first hand research and analysis and experiences on differences on both the HU8550,HU9000 and other 4K/HDMI 2.0 stuff so you can see what the extra money is buying and find everything you need to make an informed decision. Personally IMHO the HU9000 is the better deal and TV.CALIBRATION PICTURE MODESThe only question i can't get an answer on is if either TV has the Cal Day and Cal Night picture modes in the service menu. If anyone who owns either model and knows for sure, please post ASAP. These should be in the regular picture mode settings with 2 additional user modes. At the very least they should have 2 user modes that can be renamed. I hope they can fix this with a firmware update. A high end TV should have user modes.PICTURE QUALITY IMPRESSIONS AND TESTINGI was startled when i read it was 120Hz but TV's nowdays use clear motion rate instead of Hz. Just another ridiculous term to make even the most tech savy consumer pull their hair out and run screaming. Samsung has taken this to a new art with their naming of direct or edgelit local dimming. The answer to your question is forget all that. I threw all the reference and torture test Blu-rays at it both 3D and non 3D on both the HU8550 and HU9000 with the TV in showroom mode and the HU9000 in normal home mode. Not once did i see any motion blur or haloing in either set. If i did not know beforehand that either set was edgelit and you told me afterwards that it was, i would think i was being punked. I typically walk away from such sets and go for direct lit full array local dimming sets. The picture quality on both was breath taking. I never thought that i would find a TV that would make me feel totally cool leaving my Kuro Elite 9G behind. I felt giddy and excited like when i first bought the Kuro. I started with the HU8550 first because i have always perceived the whole curved thing to be a dumb fad. But i tend to be a tenacious consumer and decided to do my due dilegence and just take a peak so as to satisfy my OCD. I am so glad i did as the curved screen is no gimmick. It adds a lot of depth and you really notice it on 3D animated movies. Also the colors and detail was amazing. The HU9000 has more local dimming zones than the HU8550 so maybe that factors in. My only concern was the glare on the curved screen but looking at other sets even the HU8550 it was the same but it could be an issue for some in specific scenarios . When i tested the HU9000 in home mode i thought it was less bright and detailed but that could be because it was not set up correctly. I personally am going with the curved. Let me tell you if you knew me, you would truly understand how hell has frozen over for me with this experience vetting both sets. I am in the freaking twilight zone. So i have to give kudos to the engineering geniuses that were able to pull this off. This is the very definition of making lemonade out of lemons. So now i wonder how magnificent the Panasonic AX900 with its full array direct lighting and its glorious 128 zones will peform. This is the ZT60 replacement and from what i have heard its killer as well. It releases in the fall and yes it supports 3D. They kept telling me the AX800 did not have it. Talk about poor corporate communication. Luckily for me i will get both the HU9000 and the Panasonic AX900 if i decide it is the right time. The upgradeability of the Samsung is the only reason why i am moving forward now. I always thought that Panasonic would be the one that came out with that innovation first. The very fact that i am even looking at a Samsung and that its edgelit has me shaking my head in profound disbelief. My wife and i watch a LOT of TV and have a none existant social life so for me it was worth paying for the best even if i have to wait forever. Both samsung models and the upgradeability has me deep diving in the perfectly colored and detailed samsung sea. The blacks are black and the whites white. I saw details and colors in Avatar that i did not even see in IMAX.HDMI 2.0 SPECHDMI 2.0, which is backwards compatible with earlier versions of the HDMI specifications, significantly increases bandwidth up to 18Gbps and adds key enhancements to support continuing market requirements for enhancing the consumer video and audio experience. New functionality includes:4K@50/60, (2160p), which is 4 times the clarity of 1080p/60 video resolution  * Up to 32 audio channels for a multi-dimensional immersive audio experience  * Up to 1536kHz audio sample frequency for the highest audio fidelity  * Simultaneous delivery of dual video streams to multiple users on the same screen  * Simultaneous delivery of multi-stream audio to multiple users (up to 4)  * Support for the wide angle theatrical 21:9 video aspect ratio  * Dynamic synchronization of video and audio streams  * CEC extensions provides expanded command and control of consumer electronics devices through a single control pointThe spec does state that current high speed can handle the new bandwidth but i called 20 different manufacturers and all of them confirmed their max was 4K@24Hz, some said maybe 4K@30Hz but was stretching it. None said 4K/60Hz and were not willing to go on the record that it did.HDCP 2.2 COPY PROTECTIONis only for 4K content. If the either device in the handshake detects no support it will automatically downgrade you to 1080P then like a champ your TV will probably upscale it, LOL.  So there are special apps for 4K meaning a 4K version and a regular version. It is one app on all devices as long as your device is running the most current version. The app checks to see if you have HDCP 2.2 if it detects it will offer you the 4K stream. if not it will give you the 1080 or lower stream dpending on what is offered and what your TV can handle resolution wise.HEVC H2.65is a Highly Efficient Video Coder/c for 4k contentUPGRADE KITSSamsung UHD Video Pack 1 (CY-SUC10SH/ZA $299) Pack 2 ETR Summer 20142014 One Connect Box Model #: [B]SEK-2500V model# has now changed to SEK-2500U/ZA[/B]: $399.99 (june release)2014 Evolution Kit Model #: SEK-2000/ZA: $249.99This change in model#'s explain why the Best Buy listings were removed.Samsung UHD Video Pack Redemption Form (Free Offer Valid 4/27 thru 6/30 for HU9000 series TV only).  10 to 12 weeks for delivery[...]HU9000 MANUAL[...]HU8550 MANUAL[...]HU8550- Only the ARC and MHL ports support HDMI 2.0/HDCP2.2/4K@24/30/60Hz/FPS.

This is no gimmick. Screen reflection looked like an issue but then comparing others it is the same. Both TV's look fantastic when in Showroom mode but i got to see the HU9000 in home mode and it seemed a little less bright and sharp but i think it was not set up right.I was going to buy the HU8550 and totally dismissed the curved version thinking it was a wast of time and gimmick. But doing my due diligence i thought i'd just check it out. OMG! It makes one hell of a difference and if you can't see it you must be blind. It is more noticeable on animated 3D BD. I decided i am hands down switching to the HU9000.REMOTESBoth TV's come with:Smart Touch remote control (BN59-01184A)IR  universal remote control (BN59-011798)SMART VIEW 2.0is a cross-platform multi-screen app that enables you to load the TV screen on an NFCcompatible device (cell phone, tablet, etc), share multimedia content between two devices, and control the TV remotelyDIMENSIONS/WEIGHT65\" Without StandHU9000: 57.1\" x 33.4\" x 4.4\"HU8550  57.1\" x 32.8\" x 1.4\"65\" With StandHU9000: 57.1\" x 35.1\" x 12.9\"HU8550  57.1\" x 34.4\" x 11.6\"65\" Product Weight  (with/without stand)HU9000  68.3 lb.

Onkyo has 2 coming out with HDMI 2.0 spec, the $499-suggested 5.2-channel TX-NR535 and $699 7.2-channel TX-NR636, which features HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2. They become available in March and April and also Pioneer, Denon and Marantz have one releasing in the summer (june time frame).Onkyo's AccuEQ replaces Audyssey's MultEQ room correction which has me really worried that the next Integra models will do the same. Looks like only the TX-NR636 is using the QDEO processor (WTF at this price point) like the Integra not sure if this same chip model (might be a lower or cheaper version or Integra is getting to drop a coll higher end processor in the upcoming integra and this just a hand me down to their cousin. 4K/60Hz inputs, 4K/60Hz pasthrough output. No info if it supports HEVC H.265. 4k Upscaling and pass through, so a new receiver just for 4K/60Hz input and pass through. Right now only gamer's benefit and if broadcast and blu-ray decide to use 4k/60Hz otherwise useless. You don't need an HDMI 2.0 spec AVR/Pre-Pro now as there are no external sources for 4K yet. unless you have a gaming console, PC, 4K media player or the Nuvola NP-1 streaming player for $299 with the NVIDA Tegra 4 and Google Play support (you can play android games and PC ones).HDMI CABLESAnother thing worth mentioning is that if your external 4k device source uses 4K at 30Hz/fps or higher (or the cable connecting the ARC on both the TV/AVR) you will need to get new HDMI cables that support 18Gbps at minimum or higher (10.2 Gbps cables max out at 4K@24Hz some may claim 4K@30Hz as well but no way is it handling 4k/60Hz). Don't overpay, these cables are slowly showing up. Monoprice just added some redmere ones. If you are running the HDMI cable through a conduit try these cables: Monster HD1000 (connector size is around 0.75\"), Monoprice Redmere in wall rated cable not 18gbps (18 coming soon, connector size around 0.82\") and Cablesson Maestro 15gbps rated but they claim full hdmi 2.0 spec so i am assuming a typo n the rating but you will need to import this from the UK. The connector shells come off and can be put back on after running through conduit. Stay away from Rapidrun, great concept but it uses s-video like connectors and i can see those pins getting bent easily and it is pricey.HDMI EXTENDERS AND RUNNING CAT CABLEAs of now there no HDMI extenders not even HDBaseT that that can do anything above 4K@24Hz. There are only 2 that support ARC, Audio Control BVHD-20, $450 (not HDbaseT and uses 2 Cat 6) and Transformative Engineering HD-1($799) which is true HDBaseT with a Valens chip. Atlona also does not go above 4k@24Hz and does not support ARC. Transformative Engineering's HD-1 has 3 port Ethernet switch on both ends, has ARC, IR and RS232 as well as an optical audio port that rides on HDMI ARC for legacy equipment. However, it is very finicky with Samsung TV's as apparently Samsung does not confrom to standard HDMI protocols. Atlona, TE and Audio Control all have HDMI 2.0 Spec products in the works. As for Cat i suggest run 2 cat 6 or better. I'd go Cat 7 for future proofing. Make sure you research what connectors you buy as i bought cat 6 shielded cable and got two different types of Cat 6 connectors and boots and they don't fit the cable as it is too thick (24AWG) but the sites i bought them from said the connectors and boots would support cables sizes 23-28 AWG. You'd think that cat 6 shielded connectors and boots would fit cat 6 shielded cables right? If you are looking for an in wall rated optical cable Amazon sells a CL3 rated Blue Rigger one that seems to have gotten very positive reviews.MOUNTINGVesa Mount gate: 400mm x 400m for 55-65\" HU8550 and 9000. 4x M8(4mm x 14mm) screws . The 2014 mounts are not out yet but the Samsung kit is called ultraslim Wall Mount. You can monitor their mount page to see when they make them available. I did see this TV mounted with a standard Vesa mount though and the Oneconnect box rest nicely on top of the mount or can be secured to it via zip/cable ties should need that.[...]4K BLU-RAYDon't bother buying a 4K upscaling BD player as the TV will do that better for you. 4K blu-ray specs have not yet been finalized so it will be a while before we see true 4K movie players. Some studios are considering 4k@60Hz. Most likely the first \"4K\" players we will see will have HDMI 2.0/HDCP 2.2 ports and the smart apps will support 4k@60hz/HEVC H.265. Will probably have 4k/60Hz passthrough and 4K upscaling.4K CABLE/SATThere have been no announcements from Sat/Cable box makers on 4K devices but Tivo said they will be offering something down the road. I can see Sat TV moving quickly but not cable. Some channels and studios are also considering 4k@60Hz content. Xfinity will be bringing 4K content to the X1 platform but by then it might be the X2.GENERAL CURRENT 4K CONTENT SOURCESSamsung UHD Video Pack, Media players from Sony or universal ones, Youtube, Also Samsung and Xfinity have a deal to broadcast 4K content via the Xfinity Smart Hub app and the X1 platform will also be first to get 4K content. Samsung also has a collaboration with 20Th century Fox for content via the smart hub. So you see the trend the 4K content is going to be provided by in built TV apps and there will be some exclusive content partnerships like xfinity and samsung. Netflix, Amazon, M-Go, Comcast is going to leverage there position as owners of NBC Universal. Still trying to get information on VUDU but i would be surprised if they don't have something cooking.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Extraordinary detail.

Unit arrived on time in perfect condition.Pros:It is disconcerting for a television this large to be so light.Picture is extraordinary right out of the box.

Can't wait to see what it can do after calibration.Basic controls are for the most part intuitive.Cons:Despite the curved screen, side views still degrade. Colors wash out to a fleshy beige tone. Best to sit in front of it.Good thing basic controls are intuitive, features like voice activation, gestures, etc. aren't obvious, and documentation is lacking.You need to know how to operate the remotes to find and use the eManual.Update 5/27/2014-Just a brief update after living with the TV for a few weeks. After a professional calibration the picture is improved and better than ever. We turned off most of the sharpness settings and other gimmicks and set the grayscale- the picture is more natural from internet and cable tv sources. Upscaled live sports are just as sharp as full 4k content from Netflix. I do on rare occasion see a few moments of action jitter during live sport or the stock ticker.

The 3-D is perfect, albeit critics of 3-D abound and they deride it as some kind of passing fad. I say, if you can watch \"Desolation of Smaug\" in 3-D at your local cinema, why not enjoy the immersive experience on an equal scale at home? \"House of Cards\" in 4K will blow you away; Kevin Spacey's smallest shirt wrinkles are clearly visible. The color is superb and the calibration quite good, out of the box. Thus far, the set-up has been a breeze, albeit it must be noted that the screws provided for the stand -given the weight of the unit-are rather small and one wonders how strong they might be. It would be nice of Samsung to provide a full plastic sheet over the entire screen for shipping, instead of just the edges. That way, the delivery men (I assure you they do not wear white gloves!) would not leave fingerprints all over it. I must also correct \"Shopping Guru\" as to whether or not this set includes the One Connect box. It most definitely does. Samsung has topped itself with this one. One downside: it might just cost $3500 next year...if history is any indication.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "I'm truly surprised the glare issue hasn't been addressed by anyone.", "Author": "Chance Wayne", "ReviewID": "RS7P84DHV0605", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was planning on purchasing this set from Amazon today but first thought I would see it in person at a local box store. Yes the color was amazing, I loved the almost 3D depth perception and was truly impressed with the up scaling of non 4K material. Not sure if it was the curved screen or advanced technology that seemed to give this set a brilliance less evident on other 4K flat screen TV's on view. But then the screen turned to a full black background and there it was.... any light in the room was reflected on the screen causing a slight cast of an almost rainbow effect running across the set horizontally. At first I figured it wouldn't be an issue because how often does one view a totally black screen? But then I noticed reoccurring light reflections regardless of the screen content. I asked the salesman about it and he said all the new 2014 Samsung models had a reflection problem compared to the 2013 and earlier models. In fact he beamed a flashlight on other sets and all you saw was the white pin light reflected from the bulb. He then shined it on this model and besides the white bulb reflection you now saw three rings of rainbow colors encircling the pin light. Not good. Unfortunately Samsung wanted the set displayed at the entry way of the TV/Audio department where there was an abundance of store lights reflecting off it. Had it been displayed in a darker area I doubt I would have been as aware of its flaw. However I am concerned about what it will look like in my living room on a sunny day. Can anyone who owns the UN65HU9000 model comment on its performance in a well lit room? Thanks.UPDATE:Spoke to a rep at Crutchfield and he said both he and fellow reps instantly noticed the glare/reflection problem upon first viewing this model. Also spoke with Samsung only to be told there were no reports of any consumer problems with the glare issue. I was sorry to hear that since I had hoped their next generation might have corrected the problem. It's definitely a deal breaker for me.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best picture quality with calibration.  4k upscaling is amazing.", "Author": "A.

Do not be intimidated by the technology. The set up is an absolute breeze and, believe me, I am no tech wizard. The picture quality is superb. There are only two cautions.

You do not have to be seated directly in front of the screen, but, if you are seated more than ten feet from one side or the other, there is a drop off. If you have a very large room and want to see the picture from anywhere, I suggest you get a traditional flat screen. Secondly, be aware that not all media sources currently transmit ultra hd data.

I got first the Sony 4K X900a, a beautiful design TV with front speakers, the image was great for 4K content, I had the 4K Sony multimedia, I downloaded Elyseum 4K, it was nice but the quality was not that much different than 1080P, I was expecting the same breath taken sensation of Sony demos. I went to Best Buy and the guy from Samsung asked me to seat and watch Avatar blueray in the Samsung curve HU9000. men it was mind blowing, exactly what I was looking for, the picture looks like 4K, the upscaling and colors amazing, some juddering though, blacks are really good It look great to me coming from my former TV Pioneer Elite Kuro \"before the Sony 4K\".  This TV fulfill 85% of what I was looking for, quality picture and design so I exchanged. Now why 4 stars well for me the only weakness is the 3D, after I have the Sony X900a for almost 2 weeks with passive glasses and AMAZING 3D, for Samsung still using active glasses technology is a shame, is uncomfortable, flickering of the glasses annoying and dark picture compare with the Sony 4K.  I'm not and expert just an user, all I can say is that I watch 95% of the time bluray, Netflix, Amazon and cable and the TV picture is awesome, for the 3D I guess I will put back in the draw the movies I bought for the Sony, not worth it watching with Samsung active glasses technology, perhaps if I had never seen Sony passive 3D my judgment of Samsung 3D quality would be different. I read reviews that this TV has dual viewer capability to watch 2 different channels at the same time with the active glasses but I can't find how it works, perhaps not available in US.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wow!

They brought the tv in, took it out of the box, and plugged it in, to make sure it looked great.  Plus, rarely can anyone ever beat amazons prices.We found that, like most folks on here, the picture quality was breath taking, stunning, amazing, and well, you get, shall we say, the picture quality!As other folks are saying the ability to upgrade, will save you alot of money in the future.  We're still using our Samsung 650 52\" lcd we purchased back in 2008, its just been relocated to a spare bedroom a while back.  Samsung makes great displays that seem to last, in our experience.  However, we've had the same experience with Sony, still using a small 32 we purchased in Nov 2007.Check out the Sony version of the 65: 4k 120hz 3d tv, for 1500 less by going to:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ES5YZCW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=9325&creativeASIN;=B00ES5YZCW&linkCode;=as2&tag;=willbeusingad-20AS another reviewer noted, the passive 3d is better but, we're not watching 3d films often so, its not a big issue with us.  If your a 3d hardcore fan, we suggest the Sony but, just overall HD video, Samsung is the way to go.  The Sony is $1500 less and with that, you can pick up a 4k player, protection plan, and a stack of 3d blu-rays.  Good luck and happy TV shopping here on amazon, the best electronics store, I've never been inside.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "5 stars without a doubt", "Author": "Frankie Horan", "ReviewID": "R87NEWKV26UZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv should get 5 stars alone for the awesome detail that direst review was so good it's honestly hard to add to it but I'll try. First and foremost I love the one connect box thing is awesome it's cool to know I can upgrade this tv year after year without shelling out 4 grand a year. The color is flat out good I'd love to do a side by side with the new sony tvs when they are released because the colors on this thing are awesome plus great blacks I mean damn almost plasma level. Finally the ups calling is awesome not great on video games as much but for blu rays and even standard 1080i tv it's pretty awesome must buy if you need an upgrade.

The upscaling is way improved i think that has something to do with the pure color engine similar to sonys trilumous display blu rays look so awesome I mean really awesome lol. I think the blacks even look good not really a reviewer so I'm just trying to give thoughts it has great smart tv features and I love the one connect box I think it's a great idea that you can upgrade tvs whenever you want without having to shell out 4 grand a year hope my review helped if you guys want a picture of black levels or color I have no prob uploading one for your viewing.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$4,297.99", "Features": "Refresh Rate: 120Hz (Native); Clear Motion Rate 1440 (Effective)\nBacklight: LED (Edge-Lit w/Local Dimming)\nSmart Functionality: Yes - Motion and Voice Control with Built In Pop-up Camera\nDimensions (W x H x D): TV without stand : 57.1'' x 33.4'' x 4.4'', TV with stand : 57.1'' x 35.1'' x 12.9''\nInputs: 4 HDMI 2.0, 3 USB, 1 Component, 2 Composite\nAccessories Included: Smart Remote Control, 4 Pairs of 3D Active Glasses (SSG-5150GB)", "Name": "Samsung UN65HU9000 Curved 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51omtpyv8lL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ID2HJL0"}}
