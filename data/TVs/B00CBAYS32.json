The Orbital OBL 50055ES makes good use of higher quality metal unlike the majority of other \"high end\" flat panel TVsthat use cheap plastic components.  Easy to set up and configure with user friendly instructions and acomprehensive owners manual.  My friends are amazed with the high definition picture.  It stands out the most when viewing sports including football and soccer with the vibrant greens of the turf contrasting with the team colors and uniforms.  Orbital hit a home run with this TV! I can't wait to view the ALCS and NLCS as well as the world series and college and pro football games this fall. I highly recommend this TV to anyonewho wants a quality well built TV that will entertain for many years!", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,379.00", "Features": "58 inch HD screen\n3 HDMI and 1 USB inputs\nIncludes high quality solid tempered glass base", "Name": "Orbital OBL50058ES 58-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5180UP2En8L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CBAYS32"}}
