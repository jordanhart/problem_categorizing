{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Watch out for cloudy images -- and send it back right away!", "Author": "Christopher J. Grossman", "ReviewID": "R8VMTXUEKRF35", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am not an expert when it comes to TVs, so when it came to deciding on a new 55 inch HDTV, I simply wanted a great picture from a solid company. I researched quite a bit and decided on Samsung as they have the reputation of a high end company with quality service and reliable products.When the TV first arrived I was quite pleased. The screen size was ideal for my living room and the picture was good -- not great, but good. The best way to view the TV was by sitting in the center, as the colors did seem to fade a bit if you watched from the side. While 3D was not my motivation for buying this model, I did feel it was a nice addition. And, there is no other way to say it, the 3D is exceptionally impressive. Much better than I expected.My issue arose in the first two weeks as I noticed that, when viewing darker images, there were large cloudy areas that extended from the edges of the TV. Sports and such was fine as they typically consist of continuous bright images, but the problem would continue to be evident with movies and shows that had a darker theme. The cloudy areas never moved -- they were always stable, and they extended about 1/3 from each edge (direct center of screen was fine).Rather than immediately send the TV back, I contacted Samsung as I figured they would handle the issue and resolve it (plus I really didn't want to have to go through the return process if it was an issue that could be resolved). The customer service individual was very helpful as they assisted me in scheduling a tech to come and check the issue. About a week later, the tech arrived and I shared the problem. He said he was familiar with the issue and, after looking at my TV for about 1 minute, said he would have to call Samsung to see if they would authorize the repair (they promptly declined). He said that previously he ordered new panels with no issue, but that recently he had been instructed to not repair what they were calling \"uneven brightness.\" I was told that Samsung considers the picture normal unless the defect is visible 100% of the time. So, if the issue only occurs when the screen is darker, it's considered normal.I know another person who had bought the same model and they had not had this issue, so I called Samsung after the tech visited. The first individual I spoke to was very helpful, understood my frustration, and said that a replacement should be OK as I had only had the TV a few weeks. He noted the issue on my account and had me call another number to have the replacement handled. When I called that number, the rep told me that she could find no record of my discussion with the other rep, and that all she saw was that the tech department considered my unit normal. She said that nothing could be done and that whoever I spoke to previously would not have been authorized to offer a replacement in the first place. End of discussion.Fortunately, I contacted Amazon as it was still within 30 days, and they had no issue processing a return due to this defect. Initially I was going to just do an exchange for the same model as I obviously got a bad one. However, after seeing how Samsung failed to stand by their product, I really could not continue to support their business. I understand that I probably just got a lemon, but it's those instances that I feel truly test a company's commitment to their standards and customer service. In this instance, Samsung failed exceptionally. In the end, I went with a plasma model from a different brand, and the picture has proven to be amazing.If you do go with this TV, you probably won't have an issue as it does seem that most people are fine. However, it's important to really test your TV out when you get it. If you do notice this issue, you'll want to return it to Amazon right away. Don't bother contacting Samsung -- they won't help you and the process could extend you beyond Amazon's 30 day policy to avoid restocking/shipping charges.Hope this helps those fellow shoppers who just want a high quality picture! Good Luck.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING PICTURE, BUT SMARTHUB'S NETWORK SLOWNESS RUINS THE EXPERIENCE! (UPDATE: IT'S GOTTEN BETTER!)", "Author": "Tee4me", "ReviewID": "R1WPF7YIC82S6T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for the plethora of glowing reviews it received for its picture performance. I also bought it because it had built-in Wi-Fi. The picture quality is simply amazing! Scenes broadcast in HD look as if they're almost 3D, and by that I mean everything is so clear with unbelievable depth that it makes it look like people and things being broadcast are in the room with you! I previously owned a Panasonic Viera plasma TV, and I can honestly say this Samung LED TV has an even better picture. I didn't think any other current TV technology (except 4K) could touch a plasma. I was wrong. I can't say enough about the picture quality.Now for the bad/sad part. The Samsung SmartHub and its network ruins the total experience of this otherwise fantastic TV. The wifi connected easily and works pretty well for direct Internet surfing. HOWEVER, when you try to use the SmartHub to view streaming content from Netflix, Vudu, Amazon Instant Video, Blockbuster, etc, it is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! I have upgraded broadband service from my cable provider so my network connection is plenty fast. However, when I tried to use Netflix, Blockbuster and Amazon Instant Video through my new Samsung TV/SmartHub, my streaming video would constantly pause/stop. At first I thought it was my network connection, so I tried to play the exact same HD movie on Netflix through my Wi-Fi enabled LG Blu-Ray player and it streamed perfectly. Let me say that again: The same movie on Netflix - - through Samsung SmartHub = SLOW/PAUSE/STOP; through my LG WiFi Blu-Ray player = SMOOTH, NO HICCUPS (remember, both are using the same WiFi signal being transmitted by my router).PLEASE do your own due diligence before investing in ANY Samsung product that touts its SmartHub if you plan to use it to watch streaming video, whether it's a TV, DVD or Blu-Ray player. There are many web pages, websites and forums which discuss the DISMAL performance of the SmartHub network (should be renamed \"SlowHub\"!!). There's even one called \"OFFICIAL Samsung Smart Hub Fiasco Thread.\" For as fantastic as 99% of Samsung products are (I currently own/use 9 other Samsung products such as the Galaxy Note and Epic and I love them), I have to think that they have subcontracted their \"SlowHub\" service to a Third party.  If the quality of the network was as good as their hardware/physical products, it would work smoothly and lightning fast.To be fair, if Samsung actually listens to its users/customers and actually fixes/upgrades its SmartHub network to actually make it perform acceptably, then I will update my review to reflect that fact. Lastly, I was on the verge of returning this TV because of SmartHub's atrocious and revolting performance, but my better half and I loved the picture so much AND we had an alternate means to stream videos to the TV (vice using SlowHub) that it we decided to keep it.BOTTOM LINE: If you plan to use this or any other Samsung LED TV to simply watch TV for the superb picture, you'll be happy. BUT, if you plan to use the SmartHub and its \"features,\" you will be SORELY DISAPPOINTED. Picture = 5 stars; SmartHub = 1 star (would give it '0' or '1/2' if Amazon had those as selections).------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 11-30-2013Ok, so I just got home from my business trip. To answer a previous question, the TV does have a LAN port. However, I have not tested it. I don't think I'm going to test it anytime soon as my TV is 50+ feet away from my home computer and router setup (where I have to plug in the LAN cable). If I happen upon a spool of Ethernet cable somewhere for free, I'll connect it. However, I don't really feel like moving either my computer/router setup or my 50\" TV just to test the LAN connection.I did check again to see if Samsung released any software updates to the TV, and they did on 27 NOV 2013. They released Firmware ver.1117.4, T-MST12AKUC. I downloaded it directly through the TV's Wi-Fi connection, then installed it. Everything seems to have installed ok.The FIRST thing I checked was the performance of the Amazon Prime Video App through the SmartHub. The time was approximately 09:30 a.m., so I assumed it was off-peak hours for cable bandwidth demand. I was actually surprised as it appeared to be working marginally better. At least this time the HD video (\"The Avengers\") DID NOT pause or stop. That IS forward progress. HOWEVER, the picture was NOT HD i.e. it was grainy and \"blocky\" (I believe they call it the `screen door effect').My next test was to compare the Samsung SmartHub streaming video performance against my Roku 3 Streaming Media Player device. I was hoping that my Roku 3 was going to show similar performance to the SmartHub, BUT it again showed the HD Avengers movie with much better quality. Through my Samsung SmartHub = low resolution/grainy/screen door effect; through my Roku 3 = high quality HD like it was supposed to be. Again, at least the movie DID NOT pause or stop using the SmartHub Amazon Prime Movie App.My second set of tests later in the evening at approximately 08:30 p.m. (which I assumed was a more peak cable bandwidth time on Saturday evening) involved trying the Netflix App through the Samsung SmartHub (using the same movie, The Avengers in HD). When I started the Netflix App through SmartHub, it started a little slow. I started the HD movie and I was again \"not surprised\" by the low resolution picture. HOWEVER, after about 45 seconds, the picture cleared up SUBSTANTIALLY and it was in HD! No pausing/skipping/stopping. I actually had to stop the movie to double check that I was NOT using my Roku 3, and that I was actually using the Netflix SmartHub App, and I was.Ok, now I was starting to believe that maybe the software/firmware update actually fixed something, OR they improved their SmartHub network performance between SEP '13 and 11-29-2013. So just for S&Gs;, I went BACK to the Amazon Prime Video App through the SmartHub, and resumed playing The Avengers where I left off. Again the App started a slowly, but then `booted up' after about 40 seconds (about 30 seconds slower than my Roku 3). Then the movie resumed and lo and behold if it wasn't in HD! I was standing beside myself! Even my better half couldn't believe it (as she saw how horrible it used to be).The last litmus test of the evening (at approximately 09:15 p.m.) was to try to stream an HDX movie through VUDU using the Samsung SmartHub. I started the VUDU App through the SmartHub, and it `booted up' faster than Amazon Prime Video App or Netflix App. I really wasn't looking forward to having to rent a movie just to test the VUDU SmartHub App, but to my surprise they had a sale of HDX movies for $4.99 and $7.99 (must be a Black Friday related sale). My better half hadn't seen Wrath of the Titans and I also thought it might give the SmartHub a good test with its healthy offering of CGI and eye-popping colors. Ok, the movie was pretty entertaining, but the thing I was looking for was how it played and how it looked through the SmartHub VUDU App. We were pleasantly surprised that the movie queued up quickly, didn't pause/skip/stop and looked like it played in the max quality \"HDX\" mode.BOTTOM LINE: As of today, 11-30-2013, after downloading and installing the Firmware update, the prior issues I was having with the \"SlowHub\" appear to have been resolved. I haven't drilled down yet on the specifics of what the Firmware update `fixed' and how it did it, but I'm just happy with the outcome at this point. I will continue to test it for several more days to ensure it doesn't revert back to the SlowHub. For now, I have upgraded my rating to 4 Stars from 3. This was a substantial 'fix' in my opinion. However Samsung received its feedback, whether from direct customer complaints, Blogs or product reviews on Amazon, it appears they finally took action to address the 'SlowHub' issues. As I close this reply/update, I am happy to say that I believe the SmartHub is on its way to living up to its name! The only reason I'm not giving a full 5 Stars at this point is I still want to ensure this better performance continues, and it did take several months to fix the issues my TV was having.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pay the extra $ over the 6300 even if you don't want 3D", "Author": "Georgia", "ReviewID": "RDFBNW944IX6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a superb TV with lots of connection options. It is also 3D.About the 3D. I did not buy this TV for the 3D capability. I think it is a gimmick. After viewing some 3D content off the Samsung app, I still think it is a gimmick. Sure, it is fun to watch for a little bit. But the 3D experience on a TV is not like at IMAX. There are too many other things in the room that distract you from the picture.However, you should still buy this TV. It costs about $100 more than the 6300 (or 6350) but is well worth it? Why? Because for that money you get \"micro-dimming\". This feature is worth it! The blacks are really black and the picture works well even in a brightly lit room (and my room has lots of windows). Also, the micro-dimming removes glare. Here is how that works. When the TV is off, there is a lot of glare on my screen. Turn on the TV and the glare disappears. Amazing.You can read other reviews for the optimum settings. I am connected to a Yamaha receiver using a single HDMI cable on the ARC (Audio Return Channel) and I get great 5.1 surround sound.What if you pay more? You gain little (some more 3D glasses) by going up one step to the 7100 (7050). Go up to the 7500 and you get better micro-dimming. The 8000 gives you even better micro-dimming. The 9000 is a 4K TV. In my mind none are worth the substantial cost increase for the features that are added.In summary, for me this TV is the best value in the Samsung line. A superb picture and plenty of features for a very reasonable price.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Quality", "Author": "Mobed", "ReviewID": "RZ1YVQ02IFYA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally decided to upgrade from a 4 year old Samsung LCD 6 Series and thought this would be the perfect replacement. Picture quality is crisp and I've yet to throw something at it that it couldn't handle with a 120hz refresh rate although 240hz seems to be the new hype I have trouble really seeing a difference which makes it hard to justify the premium price for it, although this TV is a little on the pricey side it's great for what you pay. Can't judge 3D capability entirely but gave it a whirl using a PlayStation 3 and I must see for at home 3D it's pretty impressive. The TV has an abundance of apps ranging from Facebook to Amazon on demand with more being added as they go. For its size the TV feels incredibly light and is sleek and very thin. The functionality of the remote is a great idea, touch pad, voice recognition, I figured the voice recognition would have been shoddy but it seems to usually get things correct.I was on the fence about this TV but I'm really glad I took the chance, I couldn't be happier with it!***Update*** 04/24/13Although I got the TV for its 2D capability I've gotten a chance to thoroughly view some 3D content and I'm pretty amazed with the 3D quality of this TV. It's no movie theater experience but for something that sits in your home it is very impressive. I would like to also note that trying some other 3D glasses in stores from other manufacturers such as LG and Panasonic the 2 included Samsung 3D glasses seem to be the most comfortable, granted extended period of use may hurt your eyes, they are very lightweight so it's not as bothersome.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung makes great TV's that are best in their class", "Author": "Christopher J.

I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful.  This TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold.  TV's of this class have never been cheaper.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step to take into consideration is features.  Here are a few that come with this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology.  Here are some of the features of this TV:With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV.  Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter.  Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Top of the line 40 inch samsung and the picture shows it", "Author": "Wayne", "ReviewID": "R14548JM7PWZPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is hands down in my opinion the best you can buy in a 40 inch model for 2013.

The 3d on the 6400 is amazing !  I own a panasonic 55st30 with active 3d and in my opinion the 3d on this samsung looks even better. I compared the 3d quality watching avatar 3d.

Contrary to previous reviews of Pilot - my experience with them was top notch.  Communications with Pilot were great via email.  I ordered the Tv on Saturday and it arrived Thursday.  The handlers were polite and opened the TV with care.  They did not place the TV on stand.  We felt comfortable taking time to view the TV and check front and back surfaces.When the TV was turned on the first time, we were instantly impressed!!  Our previous Samsung 46 LCD - was 4 years old and had been purchased through Amazon.  A nice picture improvement going from LCD to LED.  Paper manual is limited.TV found my wireless router setting easily.  I was able to pair my wireless Apple keyboard to this TV.  With my Medialink N Router, internet speed on TV is okay - the option of using TV for website use is sufficient and I had fun trying it out.I did download to my ipad the Samsung App THX tune-up.  It was helpful and I did make some adjustments from the factory setting.The TV settings are fairly easy to navigate.  I plugged in to 3 of the 4 HDMI ports: Apple TV, Roku and Samsung Blu-Ray player.  Mirroring Apple TV to Samsung is easy and so great to stream TV shows from apps such as ABC, NBC and CBS for example.I was disappointed as I had used my Bose wave radio (which is approx 8-9 yrs old)  on my previous Samsung TV - which amplified the TV sound very nicely, but am unable to use the red/white cables to get a sound through the Bose from this TV.  From googling, other Bose radio owners have had similar difficulty - something to do with the difference in technology in hooking it up.

I know, I know... today's plasmas are practically worry-free in the area of burn-in. Except that my 2011 Samsung got it from some weather delay announcements during the break-in period (when I wasn't around to monitor). It's still on there to this day, though luckily you have to look pretty hard to notice. Plus there was the infamous \"buzz\" noise that many plasma owners have had to suffer through, seemingly at random (some people hear it, others don't, it depends on elevation or your viewing angle, etc., etc.). Plus the super glossy screen basically turned into a flashlight during the day, reflecting any and all light sources coming from the window. Due to all of these factors, I jumped onto the LED-LCD bandwagon. I was immediately disappointed.Now I must admit that I am a mid-range home theater level snob/elitist. Many of you will no doubt be completely satisfied by this TV, particularly if you have never owned a plasma. Those of you who would prefer to continue your life looking through LED-lit glasses might want to stop reading. Here goes...NEGATIVES: Off-angle viewing is incredibly poor. Even if you are practically dead center, you can still rock back and forth in your seat and see the black bars turn lighter. When I stand up to get a snack or something, I can see the screen get lighter, and anybody who visits and is not sitting directly in front of the TV will have washed-out colors to look forward to. Screen uniformity is okay, but there are bluish blobs on the sides of the screen that are glaringly apparent during dark scenes. No matter what picture settings you tweak, they will always be there. Now it's possible that those are unique to my particular screen, but I doubt it. There is also a bit of \"flashlighting\" in the corners, though you can only see it during dark scenes.Motion is just awful compared to Plasma. I have tried every setting. The one that works the best is Custom, Blur Reduction at 10 and Judder Reduction to 0 (as suggested by CNET for the previous year's model). Having AutoMotion turned on with anything other than this setting induces the infamous soap opera effect, which apparently many people do not even notice. High def programming looks good with AutoMotion on these custom settings (though there is still occasionally a strange, \"simmering\" effect on faces and the occasional hitch in wide, panning shots- these problems increase if you turn the AutoMotion setting off completely).When I switch to DVDs (on the same input, using an Onkyo TX-NR717 receiver), there is so much hitching and frame skipping in the picture that I have to switch AutoMotion from Custom to off. This could be the result of the SD material being upconverted to HD. Also, the PQ looks noticeably worse on standard def programming. The PQ settings that look great for HD suddenly look awful for upconverted DVD. On my plasmas, this was never an issue. But the imperfect motion is the real deal-breaker for me. I find it incredibly distracting. Had I not owned plasmas, I may not have even noticed. Now for my final qualm: the screen still has a pretty fair amount of glare and reflection during the day. Really doesn't seem like much of an improvement over my plasma. Apparently many of the LED-LCD screens are also glossy now in order to achieve deeper blacks.POSITIVES: In terms of contrast, most HD programming looks almost as good as plasma. It's just too bad that the vibrant colors and fairly deep blacks are overshadowed by the unnatural motion, the poor off-angle viewing, the \"flashlighting\" in the corners and the bluish blobs I mentioned earlier. There's no buzz and no worrying about image retention or possible burn-in. The smart TV features suite is excellent, especially the inclusion of HBO Go. The remote is interesting, but will take some getting used to for most everyone. These features are the same on the comparable plasma models.BOTTOM LINE: I'm a huge cinephile. I watch at least four movies a week and I love HD programming. Many of my favorite shows are still only available in SD, however, and those look noticeably worse on LCD compared to plasma. In spite of the plasma flaws I mentioned earlier, the most important aspect in selecting a TV is getting the best picture quality possible, at least as much as a person's budget will allow. I want the colors to be vibrant and the blacks as realistic as possible. I also need realistic, cinematic motion. That's why I'm going back to plasma. I knew it was a risk to switch after four years, but I didn't expect there would be so many compromises. But most people will be fine with this, especially if they've never witnessed the difference. The 60\" plasma model is about $500 cheaper, has the same features and better picture quality. Sure, I may have to baby it a little during the \"break-in period.\" But it's totally worth it to have a picture I can marvel at and which will allow me to become totally immersed in the experience again. If you think I'm being an elitist, read 90% of the  LED-LCD reviews on CNET. Many of those have the same complaints I have outlined here.UPDATE:I've spent some more time with the TV this week, and found that these 2 settings were causing the smeary faces effect: Digital Clean View and MPEG Noise Filter. I have turned them off and now have virtually no problems with the motion. I have the PQ looking great for HD, but Standard Def still doesn't look as good as it did on Plasma. But I don't think that's enough of a reason to return it. SD will always look like garbage compared to HD, anyway. I have the black levels looking great... the \"flashlighting\" is very minor and those bluish blobs I spoke of are pretty much unnoticeable except in very dark scenes, and even then, you have to look for them to find them. I do like that the TV is brighter in the daytime, even if there is still some glare from the window (or the lamp at night). It's a slight improvement for daytime viewing when compared to my last two plasmas. The off-angle viewing is poor, but that really doesn't affect me with the way I have my living room set up.

Wasn't married to the brand, I was also looking at Sharp. Samsung's smart features seemed more refined, and the web browser got good reviews. I watch a lot of streaming stuff from different sites (like, apart from Youtube, Dailymotion, and other sites with apps, though I do use those as well.) So I needed something that was flexible.Was going to go with a 60\" F6300 here but I found the 55\" to be more manageable and cheaper. It came down to the F6300 and the F6400, and the remote on the F6400 had a trackpad and voice commands, which makes web browsing much easier. It also uses the Samsung keyboard, though I don't own one yet. 3D is nice, but not critical, and the microdimming part doesn't sway me one way or the other.I've had the TV in my house for about a month now.  What do I like best?  The image quality and web browsing. Followed by how easily it pairs your accounts, such as Youtube.What cons have I noticed?  I don't like the slightly dark corners that plague edge-lit LEDs.  Maybe the same sharing of content with other smartphones aside from Samsung.  Better app functionality - the Youtube and other apps could definitely benefit from a virtual keyboard rather than scrolling through letters.TV's have advanced so much in the last few years on the app and web browsing front.  This TV is a great example of that progression when compared to where they were just a few years ago.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this to a friend (or fellow amazon shopper).", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best large screen I've owned.", "Author": "Joey \"Joey\"", "ReviewID": "RZD9ECJTKKDCY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the last 10 years I've owned a 42\" Hitachi plasma, a 42\" Sony and a 46\" Sony LCDas well as this last 50\" Samsung LED.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R32N0286VXRKZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have now owned my Samsung UN50F6400 for almost three months. Rather than analyzing things like picture quality (great, overall imho, although I haven't watched anything in 3D yet), I would like to focus this review on what this HDTV does. I have organized my review around the structure of the UN50F6400 menu system, which Samsung calls its SMART HUB.The SMART HUB consists of five \"screen panels\" for the following TV functions:1. Social--to connect to friends in various ways2. Apps--to use or download apps3. OnTV--to watch a television program from coaxial input4. Movies & TV Shows--to purchase movies or TV shows5. Photos, Videos & Music--to display media from a computer or phone on your wireless network or from a drive or device plugged into a USB port on the TV.When you turn on the TV, you are taken initially to the OnTV screen panel. At the very top of the screen you will see five icons representing the five screen panel choices. Ordered from left to right, the icons and their corresponding panels appear as follows:1. Yellow speech balloon: Social2. Green squares: Apps3. Blue TV: OnTV4. Purple triangle: Movies & TV Shows5. Red camera: Photos, Videos & MusicThe icon for the panel screen you are currently viewing is encircled with a hexagon. So, when you first turn on the TV, the blue TV icon has a hexagon around it, indicating that the OnTV screen panel is active. You can navigate around the SMART HUB with either the left-right arrows on the Samsung keyboard (or remote--but I always use the keyboard) and hitting the Enter key to select the icon for the screen panel you want, or by using the mouse pad on the keyboard to move the pointer to the icon and tapping the pad to select. Or, if you are scrolling across the main screen with the left or right arrows and continue past the edge of the screen, this will take you to the next panel.Navigating to any of the five screen panels by the above procedure is extremely easy. And, if you happen to get lost in some layer of an application and want to start over at the main SMART HUB screen, you can just press the SMART HUB button on the keyboard or remote and it will return you to the OnTV screen panel. The SMART HUB button is prominent and easy to find because it is the only colored key on the keyboard or remote.Next, I will discuss the layout and use of each of five screen panels in the SMART HUB. I will begin with the OnTV panel, even though it is the third screen panel, because that is the default panel when you first turn on the TV or hit the SMART HUB button.OnTVThe OnTV screen panel provides two pieces of information: what is currently being streamed to your TV, and what TV shows are available for watching. If you imagine the entire screen being divided into quarters, the upper left hand quarter contains a preview of what will be displayed on your TV if you hit Enter on your keyboard. For example, if Masterpiece Theatre from your PBS station is the current audio/video source for your TV, you'll see and hear that show in an inset window that is about 25% of your total screen. The effect is similar to a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) display. If you navigate (with your mouse or arrow keys) to the PiP display and hit the Enter key on your keyboard, the PiP will expand to full-screen size.What initially appears in the PiP window depends on the A/V source you had last selected when you were previously using the TV. So if you were watching PBS yesterday when you turned off the TV, whatever is on PBS now will appear in the window the next time you turn it on. In my case, I watch very little TV, so the A/V source I was using last is usually my A/V receiver, which I have connected to the TV through the TV's HDMI2 input-output port. (HDMI2 is the TV's HDMI port that must be selected for two-way communication, allowing audio from the TV to be amplified by my receiver as well as video from the receiver being carried to the TV.) In my set-up, I have almost every imaginable device running into my A/V receiver--a DVD player, Blu-Ray player, VHS tape player, CD carousel, cassette tape player, vinyl record turntable, and a PC. (For the record I own other A/V esoterica, including a CED VideoDisc player and a reel-to-reel tape recorder, but they aren't hooked into the system). The A/V receiver itself can be a source of Internet audio, including Pandora, Internet radio, and audio from DLNA devices in my home network. In short, when I turn on my Samsung TV, just about anything except a television signal is likely to be displayed in the PiP window.Actually, for about two weeks when I still had cable TV, I did sometimes see a TV program in the OnTV screen, because my cable signal was routed through the A/V receiver like everything else. But, as planned, I gave up my cable TV and its hideous costs after I bought the Samsung TV, thinking the money would be better spent on a smart TV. I installed an over-the-air antenna on the roof and can get excellent HD signals from ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, PBS and several others--14 in all--so I am not missing cable TV at all. At least not until football season starts and I do not have ESPN. :-( . I am sharing this information that might seem irrelevant to make an important point about the Samsung TV. Because I have my OTA TV signal coming into the coaxial input of the TV and everything else entering the TV via my A/V receiver connected to the HDMI2 input, if I turn on my TV after having last watched something through the receiver and the receiver has not been powered on first, the Samsung TV become unhappy and gives me the first of two unsavory messages:\"Check the device is connected properly, then try turning on the device or changing the source using the buttons below.\"If I fail to heed this warning by either hitting the SOURCE button on my keyboard or remote to choose OTA Broadcast TV or by powering on my A/V receiver, the Samsung TV gives me a second warning:\"No SignalHDMI2(1) Check the cable connections and the settings of your source device.(2) Press SOURCE on your remote to select connected source device.\"These warnings obviously do not indicate anything fatal. It is just slightly annoying to be warned about the lack of input to HDMI2 if I don't have my receiver turned on. And there are times when I don't care to use the receiver, such as using the TV's Web browser and perfectly fine TV audio. What happens when I get the first warning is that I have to hit the ENTER key on the keyboard to clear the warning message and then hit the SMART HUB key to clear the second warning message and to be able to switch to the App screen panel to use the Web browser. Again, this is just a slight annoyance.So much for the long aside about potential warning messages when the TV cannot detect a source.In addition to the PiP window that displays what is currently being streamed to the TV from whatever source, The other three-quarters of the OnTV screen panel contains a number of tiles, each one containing an image of a TV show. The six tiles to the right of the PiP window display shows that are currently on, while the six tiles below the PiP display shows that are coming up. Navigating to any of these tiles with your mouse or arrows brings up more details on the show, and selecting any of the shows currently on will immediately bring up the show, full screen. I found that even when I was currently using HDMI2 as the source, selecting a show that was on would automatically change the source to OTA Broadcast TV to display the show. The Smart TV is indeed pretty smart.One thing about the OnTV panel screen that puzzles me is how the system decides which channels to display in the 12 tiles containing the current and coming up shows.  For whatever reason, the system decided to display what was currently on Fox, ABC, two PBS channels, and something called the Video on TV channel, which I have yet to figure out--all I know is that it displays video shorts from the Internet on a variety of different subjects. And the system left one of the six \"currently on\" tiles blank instead of displaying one of the many other available channels I get. Furthermore, on the \"coming up\" tiles, four different upcoming ABC shows and two upcoming CBS shows were displayed. If there is a way of controlling what appears on the \"currently on\" and \"coming up\" tiles, I haven't been able to figure out how to do this from the TV's manual. My guess is that there is a way to do this, but the method is not obvious.If you prefer a visual format for the OnTV panel that is different from the default display I have just described, you can select one of two on-screen menu items labeled \"Guide\" and \"Timeline View.\" Or, if you want to the tiles altogether to display the current source on full screen as the default, you can select that as an option by hitting the Menu key on the keyboard and choosing \"Smart Features\" and then \"On TV Settings.\"SocialNot being a terribly social person, I have not used the first panel screen on the far left, Social. But I can describe what is there. Essentially, this panel allows you to link to your Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Skype accounts to connect to your friends through these services. Note that in order to Skype, you need to install a Samsung camera model VG-STC3000/ZA, which is sold separately. Because I do have all four of these accounts, I imagine that someday I will see how well the Social panel supports them. When I get the camera I will also be able to see how well the \"motion gesture\" feature of this smart TV works. But at the present, I can only provide this brief description of what is available on the Social panel, not how well it works.Oh yes, there is one other choice for the Social panel to expand your world view beyond your network of personal friends. There is a \"What's Hot\" option that will take you to the currently most popular videos on YouTube.AppsBecause I discontinued our cable service, the Apps panel is the most important feature of my Samsung TV. My hope underlying the purchase of a smart TV is that I would be able to watch TV shows and movies, mostly through services such as Netflix and Hulu Plus, but also from other Internet sites through a Web browser. Results so far have been mixed. The Netflix and Hulu Plus apps work just fine for the most part (note that you will have to sign up for or register your paid account with these services in order to use the TV apps). However, for reasons difficult to decipher, some of the content from these services cannot be accessed through the apps, resulting in a message indicating that you must go to the website to access the content. This kind of defeats the purpose of having a dedicated Netflix or Hulu app, in my opinion. Not to mention the inconvenience of needing to exit the app to fire up the Web browser app to navigate to Netflix or Hulu.The other problem with looking to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc. as a substitute for cable TV is that you cannot always get what you want. In particular, sporting events and individual, current episodes of TV programs are almost impossible to find on the Internet on a pay-per-view basis. The same is true for many movies. Because I am no longer a cable subscriber, I would be more than willing to purchase/rent movies, sports events, and individual episodes (or whole series) of TV shows over the Internet. I look forward to the day when all content can be purchased on a per-piece basis and I will gladly pay for it. Heck, I might even renew my cable subscription if my provider began to offer reasonable smorgasbord packages.The unavailability of certain content (or the unwillingness of some people to pay for it) has led many people to websites such as PrimeWire.ag (formerly 1channel.ch, aka vodly.to and letmewatchthis.ch) to stream this material. If you are hoping to do this on a Samsung smart TV, you will be disappointed, because streaming such material with Samsung's provided Web browser app simply does not work well at all. Even with popup blockers, the popups and redirects from these sites make streaming impractical, if not impossible. Which is perhaps just as well, as the legality of streaming copyrighted material from such sites is highly dubious. Some say that it is legal to receive streams from these sites as long as you do not download copyrighted material, but streaming does download material into temporary files. So it is hard for me to believe that streaming videos from these sites is not in violation of copyright law. Like I said, I am frustrated by the unavailability of certain media and I look forward to the day when I can purchase anything on a per-piece basis.To return to the App panel in general, Samsung has organized it by tiles, with the top row of tiles labeled as recommended apps. These include Netflix, Pandora, Hulu Plus, Shop TV, Explore 3D, Amazon Instant Video, CNBC Real Time, and Samsung Apps. Samsung Apps is a meta-app, designed to let you download more apps (some free, some for a dollar or two or three) from the Samsung App website. Below this top row of recommend apps are three rows of tiles labeled \"My Apps.\" Actually, when you first browse to this panel screen, some of the tile spaces are blank--open spots for additional apps you want to download. And you can continue to another screen if you want more than three rows of apps.The very first app in row one, column one under My Apps is the all-important Web browser, which I will say more about in a moment. Not that it is all that important, but I found it odd that this is merely one of many \"My Apps\" instead of one of the top row \"Recommended Apps.\" I mean, each of the other apps does one little thing, but the browser gives you full access to the Web! Examples of other apps already loaded under My Apps are VUDU, HBO Go, Amazon Cloud Player, and some fitness apps. I was greatly disappointed to discover, during the two weeks that I was still subscribed to Comcast, that the HBO Go app could not be used because Comcast was not one of the dozen or so cable providers that allowed the app to function. This gave me another reason to unsubscribe from Comcast.Also included in the My Apps section are Facebook, Twitter, and Skype. If you remember, these services are also available on the Social panel screen. I guess there is nothing inherently wrong with some redundancy, but this makes me wonder what the point of having the separate Social panel.I haven't tried all of the available apps, but the ones that I have tried work as well as the apps on my Samsung Galaxy smartphone, for the most part. Logically, they should work as well. In fact, shouldn't they work a little better, given that the TV has a more powerful processor, larger screen, and external, full keyboard and mouse? You would think so, but in some cases I found the TV apps to be surprisingly primitive--as primitive as the software that I happily no longer run on the Comcast set top box that I have returned. Specifically, in cases where you think you should be able to type words into a search box with the external keyboard, instead you have to navigate with the arrow keys through a matrix of letters and numbers on the screen to spell out the words, one letter at a time. On my phone, I can always type in search terms with a virtual keyboard. In fact, I can connect a USB keyboard and mouse to my phone if I like.This odd, primitive way of spelling words is not found in every application. Fortunately, for the Web browser app, you can use your mouse to click on the search box, which will bring up a virtual keyboard on screen, but you won't need it if you have the external keyboard. You can simply type words into the search box effortlessly with your external keyboard. (If you are using just the remote, you would have to navigate to each key on the virtual keyboard to enter letters one at a time. This is why you should definitely invest in the external keyboard, which is very nice.)For Netflix and Hulu, however, searching for movies and shows will feel like you are using 1980s VCR technology. The Netflix app presents you with a matrix of letters with a-f in the first row, g-l in the second, m-r in the third, etc. You cannot use the mouse to select letters--you must use the arrow keys to navigate to a letter and then hit enter to select it. So, when I searched for Napoleon Dynamite, I first selected n, and then a, etc. As you select each letter, the app will immediately list all of the titles with the letters you have entered so far. So, you might not have to enter 17 characters (including the space) before Napoleon Dynamite appears in the list of movies. Still, this is a terribly awkward way of searching for movie titles.Hulu searching is similar to Netflix's, except that the letters a-z are all laid out horizontally on the same line of the screen instead of as a matrix. I found this neither better nor worse than the Netflix layout. Both are equally insane. In contrast, if you launch the Web browser app and go to Hulu Plus, you can click in the search box with the mouse and use your external keyboard to type in the name of the title you want to search for. Why can't the dedicated Netflix and Hulu apps work the same way?In summary, I think that Samsung provides a nice set of apps that generally function just fine. Furthermore, most of them are free. I was surprised, though, that some apps required me to point and click on on-screen letters to spell out words instead of allowing me to type the words with my Samsung keyboard. This method works but is clunky, and hopefully the apps will be updated some day to support the normal use of the keyboard.Movies & TV ShowsThe Movies & TV Shows panel screen is the location dedicated to the renting and purchasing of movies and TV shows (surprise, surprise).  This panel displays within a fairly large window on the left half if the screen a \"Featured Movie.\" I have no idea what criteria are used to select the featured movie, but it changes regularly. To the right of the featured movie are a set of tiles that contain \"Recommended\" movies and TV shows. Again, who knows how these are chosen? Perhaps the featured and recommended listings are initially based on what is popular in the overall population of Samsung users and eventually becomes tailored based upon what you watch. That's my best guess, anyway.The menu at the very bottom of the panel screen displays the following choices, from left to right: Favorites, Featured, Movies, TV Shows, and Purchased. Clicking on any of these menu items will present you with a display of tiles, each containing a still picture of a movie or TV show. You also have an option of sorting by genre. Nothing surprising here; I'm not sure what else a menu should contain or how else it might function.What is stunningly surprising, however, is that the main screen panel does not contain a search box to search for movies or TV shows by title. Huh? You mean if I want to search specifically for Napoleon Dynamite, I have to click the Movies link and then browse through pages of tiles in the comedy genre to find this movie? The setup of the Movies & TV panel screen seems to be optimized for people who do not know what they want to watch and are happy to browse through dozens of suggestions until they find one that looks good to them. Very, very odd.But, it turns out that there is a way to search for specific movies or TV shows, and you do not have to be on the Movies & TV shows panel screen to conduct such a search. You can do a search from any screen by pressing the SEARCH button on the Samsung keyboard. If you do not have the Samsung keyboard, I'm not sure if there is another way to do this.However, when you want to search for a movie this way, the Samsung software will give you far more information than you want. In addition to listing movies with titles similar to the one you are looking for, the software will also display what it thinks are relevant results from photos, videos, and music on your home network. Very curious. Furthermore, the software has an unfathomable algorithm for deciding what content is relevant to your search. When I typed in \"Oz\" (expecting to see Wizard of Oz-related movies), among the results were a picture on one of my networked computers labeled Colors of Love (it is a graphic of John Lee's love styles), a BBC program on consumers, and Joni Mitchell's song, A Case of You. Somebody needs to tune up that search engine.By the way, I was able to locate a DVD of Napoleon Dynamite for sale with this method. It turned out that this would be my only option for viewing the movie, because Netflix and Hulu do not provide it. This underscores a problem with depending on those services--they have a lot of movies and TV shows, but not all of them. Vote for Pedro--maybe he can do something about this.Photos, Videos, & MusicThe Photos, Videos, & Music panel screen is, obviously, dedicated to displaying photos and playing videos and music. The source of these media can be a device plugged into one of the USB slots in the back of the TV or any DLNA device in your home networked. The main menu provides you (again, obviously) with three choices: Photos, Videos, or Music. Once you begin using this panel, it will display through a set of tiles what it calls \"Enjoyed Content\" (translation: media that you have accessed previously--whether you enjoyed it or not). If you want to access media that you have not previously accessed, you can browse through the relevant folders of the source of your media in the usual fashion. I suppose you could search for material by name with the SEARCH key on the keyboard, although I would not recommend this (see comments on searching in the previous section). Overall, this panel screen works fine. I had no problem displaying/playing media from either a USB drive or a computer on my home network.Additional Thoughts and Final CommentsThere are scads of features on the smart TV that I have not tried yet or decided not to include in this already lengthy review of the SMART HUB panel screens. One area I want to explore more thoroughly in the near future is the interconnectivity of the TV with other Samsung devices, especially my Galaxy 4 phone. There's a feature called Screen Mirroring that will project whatever my phone is doing onto the Samsung TV. When Screen Mirroring is activated, if I check my email, browse the Web, display a picture, play music, play a movie, or play a game on my phone, what I normally see and hear on the phone will also be seen and heard on the TV. (The phone will continue to display images but not duplicate the audio that is now output from the TV.) I found this feature to work well with still images, but I had inconsistent success with displaying movies this way. Connecting the phone with an HDMI cable is probably a better choice for projecting movies.Another connectivity feature, called Samsung Link (aka Samsung Allshare Play), allows file sharing and playing among all of your registered devices. This might seem somewhat redundant with Screen Mirroring (both allow you to project pictures and play movies and music from your phone onto the TV) and also redundant with the Photos, Videos, & Music panel screen on the TV (which pulls files from networked devices as opposed to projecting files from your phone to the TV). There are two differences. First, with Samsung Link, in addition to your phone you can also register a tablet, laptop, and/or desktop PC (regardless of brand) as well as cloud storage such as Google Drive and Dropbox, allowing sharing among all of these devices. Second, in contrast to Screen Mirroring, which projects the current activity of your phone onto the TV, Samsung Link is specifically for sharing files and playing media files across devices. You get to designate folders that can be accessed on each device through Samsung Link. This feature seems to work well, although the program seems to be forever asking me whether it is okay to give access to a detected, registered device on the network that I had previously approved.One last topic I want to address is the interaction between my Samsung smart TV and my Pioneer SC-1222-K A/V Receiver, which I purchased about two and a half months before I bought the TV. This dual purchase resurrected an old issue I experienced when I bought my first Samsung HDTV (model HLN5065wx-xaa) and Pioneer VSX-55txi \"A/V\" receiver back in 2004. (I put the \"A/V\" in quotes because the only video this receiver could input and output was through Firewire. And that was in theory--I never got it to work with any of the Firewire devices in my system.) The issue I had back then was, \"Which device should serve as the main hub of my home entertainment system?\" The sound produced by the receiver was obviously of much higher quality, suggesting that all of my audio components should feed into it. But my HDTV had both video and audio inputs, so it wasn't clear whether I should feed both video and audio from my cable box, DVD player, VCR, and HTPC into the TV, or to feed only the video into the TV while running the audio through my receiver. I eventually opted for the latter, as the accompanying hassles seemed to be slightly less. This choice did require purchasing a separate DVI switchbox to choose with a mini-remote which video device would be projecting to the TV, and using the receiver remote to choose the audio source. But at least I could leave the TV set on DVI input, which was the highest quality video input available. The alternative would have been to use the TV remote to choose among the DVI and various component and analog input channels while leaving the receiver set on monitoring the audio from the TV set. I had the system wired to work either way, but almost always made the receiver the hub, the center for choosing audio input.I thought I could better resolve the battle between my TV and receiver as the hub of the home entertainment system by eventually buying an A/V receiver with multiple HDMI inputs and an HDMI output to the TV. When newegg put the Pioneer on sale for less than half-price, I bought it immediately and thought I would be satisfied with converting the HDMI output to DVI for my old Samsung HDTV. But after a month or so I began to crave the smarter technology of the new smart TVs as well as the sensibility of a two-way HDMI connection between the receiver and TV. So, I finally broke down and got the Samsung smart TV. And I have zero regrets about this. Even though my old Samsung still functioned perfectly as a monitor, the picture on the newer Samsung is so much clearer, and the overall set is much less bulky than Samsung's first HDTV. And the two-way HDMI connection works well, even though sometimes when I want the audio from the TV to run through the receiver I have to turn the receiver off and on again. And even though the TV sometimes sends me warning messages about seeing no HDMI input from the receiver.And even though there are still slight issues about which component is the hub of the system. Both are connected via Ethernet cables to the Internet and can access some of the same services. So, do I select Pandora on my receiver and display its menu on the TV, or do I choose the Pandora app on my TV and stream its audio to my receiver? In the end, it really does not matter, because the components do play very well together, even though they are made by different companies. The same playing nicely phenomenon exists with all of my other components, including the new Sony Blu-Ray player that I purchased at the same time as the TV, giving me yet a third option for accessing Pandora. ;-) One of these days I am going to watch Avatar on the Blu-Ray player and will find out how well the Samsung displays 3D. I have been very happy so far with what I have experienced in the first three months with my Samsung smart TV, and I look forward to exploring new features in the future. I would definitely recommend this particular model to any person who is considering it.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dumb TV Turns itself off and on repeatedly", "Author": "J.

I sent this TV back to Amazon after a 5-day trial. It has a fair picture and good backlighting, but fast-moving scenes (and sports) are a bit jittery. Active 3D glasses (which this TV requires) are very annoying, and I cannot use them at all. The \"smart touch\" remote is not good in my opinion. LG 240Hz TVs are much better in my opinion, and I have already replaced this one with the LG 60LA7400 with which I am very happy.Full Review:I bought this TV from Amazon, and it was in my living room with white-glove delivery service in four days. I played with the controls a bit and tried to set it up to my liking, but I just couldn't get the picture to be as smooth as my 47-inch LG (47LM7600) that I had bought in July of 2012. It seemed like the TV had trouble keeping up with the NFL game that I was watching as the screen was jerky. I tried all that I knew how to no avail. In a last-ditch effort for it to redeem itself I watched a 3D movie through HBO on-demand, and that was the last straw. This TV comes with (and requires the use of) active 3D glasses. After owning the 47LM7600 and using passive 3D glasses for a year and a half I simply could not put up with the actives, and I had a headache in less than a minute.At the risk of insulting one's intelligence I will try to explain the difference between active and passive 3D glasses based on my current knowledge. For us (people) to feel like an image is in 3D and coming out of the screen our left and right eyes must see slightly different images \"at the same time\", more appropriately at a rate faster than our eyes can sense.3D TVs that require active glasses do this by flickering between screen images meant for the right eye and images meant for the left eye while at the same time your active (battery-powered) glasses flicker your lenses (right eye opaque left eye clear, then left eye opaque right eye clear), which means your glasses need to have an on-board watch-style battery as well as a lens material (which is typically somewhat heavily shaded) that will respond to the electrical signal that is meant to turn the lens opaque (somewhat like a welding mask). This is either done at 60 frames per second per eye (120Hz TV), 120 frames per second per eye (240Hz TV), or 300 frames per second per eye (600Hz Plasma TV). No matter the way you can't, unless you are superhuman, sense it since the human eye typically can only sense flickering at anywhere from 10Hz to 20Hz. Also the lenses tend to be very small so there is very little tolerance for your head being turned even slightly. If you have to wear prescription eyeglasses to watch TV, then you can forget about using active 3D glasses because they won't fit over them. In any case while I may not be able to see flickering, something was definitely causing me to develop a headache very rapidly which does not happen with the passive technology. So for me, I prefer the passive.3D TVs that use passive 3D glasses do the image clipping so that the glasses only have to be polarized and slitted (no you can't see the slits) in a certain way for your eyes to see what is intended. The TV does this by showing the image for the left eye on the odd pixel rows only, then showing the image for the right eye on the even pixel rows only (or vice-versa). Again it's done at either 120Hz or 240Hz, so you can't see flickering. The disadvantage to this style is obviously that each screen image is only half of the pixels, so there are black lines in between each pixel row. But if you can imagine dividing your TV into 1080 individual rows and changing between the 540 odd rows and the 540 even rows 120 times per second, then you see how it would be difficult to see any black lines unless you sit really close, and I mean Poltergeist \"they're here\" close, to the TV or if you sit 5 feet away from an 80-inch TV. In either of the two latter cases you're in for bigger problems than noticing a few black lines.I didn't intend for my review to be a bashing of active 3D or an endorsement of passive 3D, but unfortunately that's how it turned out after I was done typing.

THIS is a setting I'd change for sure!  It has inspired me to read the manual as there's so many configurable things inside this tv.***This TV is terrific in a lot of ways.  The picture is really amazing - which is obviously at the top of the list.  No discernible pixelation on fast moving objects, action movies and sports.  Blacks are BLACK and images are crisp (almost too crisp at time).  The small touch pad remote is different than the typical monster with 100's of buttons.  Once you get the hang of it it's pretty cool!  The HDMI-CEC (the part where it talks to other components like a receiver, BD player, etc over HDMI) works really well and the tv is good at knowing what's going on and changing the inputs for you.The \"Smart Hub\" features also rock too.  Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, etc...  all setup and stream without any issue.In the Smart Hub, aside from the Apps there is also a \"Social Center\" where I guess you can Tweet, Facebook and other networks the status of \"I'm watching my tv\" - very exciting stuff I haven't explored yet.  If you are a social network person - I suppose it's pretty cool.  There's a \"spend money on video content center\" that is all through Samsung's media store.  Haven't used it but kinda cool if you can't get what you want off your other streaming services - nice to have options.  It does take an entire page of the 4 pages of the Smart Hub...  but I can't blame Samsung on that one.  The last page is a media sharing page - you can pull images, music and videos off a USB stick (which is stupid because the friggin USB port is in the middle of the back of the TV) or off your home network/pc or out of the cloud.

I'm currently trying to figure out how to take full advantage of the 120Hz refresh rate--I have an Oppo Blu Ray player and a Roku 3, which seem to broadcast at 60Hz--but I don't know if that'll even make any difference. The picture quality is amazing, colors are bright, and blacks are black.And I do want to add this for people who might not know how to do it: Samsung (and many other t.v. makers) are including several new technologies that decrease blur in high-motion scenes; Samsung calls this the \"Clear Motion Rate.\" Many reviewers will no doubt love this, as it seems to make characters in the foreground three dimensional, but I hate it. I don't like the way it smooths camera movement; motion looks fake, like the scenes were shot on a Steadi-Cam coated in butter.

I've never had an 3D TV before and this one is a winner. The active 3D glasses are better than the passive ones because you see full images from each eye at quick succession.

And to be honest with you I think 1080p will be good for a few more years. Watching Avatar and Life of Pi in 3D is something to be hold. I also played a few games in 3D as well. Stardust HD is excellent in 3D. Batman Arkham City on the 360 is also pretty decent. I have to warn you though. You will get a headache the first time you use the 3D. But you will get used to it. Now I don't get headaches any more.I also love the smart aspect of the TV. You get all the popular apps out there on the Samsung Apps Store. I love watching TWIT on this huge TV. Now I don't even need to turn on the 360 to watch instant videos. It's all there natively. One of my favorite apps that samsung included is Explore 3D. This app streams 3D content to your TV without a fee or subscription. There a ton of free 3D documentaries on there.My least favorite thing about this TV is the remote control. I don't understand why there isn't directional,numerical, play/pause buttons on it. Why do I have to use the inaccurate touch pad to swipe when directional buttons can do the same thing and alot faster? I may have to get a new remote. If you have any recommendations please let me know.Getting back to the positives, I really like how the small the bezel is on this thing. It's about 1/2 of an inch. And it's also super thin as well.

This was the deciding feature that made me choose this TV and not some other. A lot of TV say they can do this, but in reality, if you look at their specifications in the data sheets, you will see this is very limited and are only able to view pictures or open .mp3 song files. This TV can play most video, audio and picture files. Just so it's easy for everyone who is interested in this feature, which I think is essential nowadays I will copy and paste the supported formats from the manual:Photos: .bmp, .jpg, .mpo, .pngMusic: .aac, .flac, .m4a, .mpa, .mp3, .ogg, .wmaVideo: .3gp, .avi, .asf, .flv, .m2ts, .mkv, .mov, .mp4, .mpg, .mts, .svi, .ts, .tp, .trp, .vob, .vro,.webm, .wmvSubtitles: .ass, .psb, .smi, .srt, .ssa, .sub, .ttxt, .txtWith .avi, .mkv, and .mp4 files, the TV supports embedded subtitles.Again, I want to stress the above feature.

Now, I don't want to say this TV has a bad sound or anything. It is on part with every TV out there, maybe even better. The is loud and crisp enough, but it is by no means of the quality of a surround-sound system and lacks base. If you want the \"movie experience\" you will need to buy a sound system, which I think I will start looking for.The TV comes with 2 pairs of 3D glasses.

I just got this \"TV\" (Samsung UN40F6400) a couple weeks ago so while I've tried most of the features I got the TV for I haven't explored everything.  Also, I don't know how well/if the RF/cable features of the TV work at all.  I gave up on Charter, the only cable TV company in town, a long time ago and RF reception isn't so great here so I basically don't watch \"TV\" at all anymore.That said, it is a good \"TV\".  I love the micro-dimming and the overall picture quality.  Built in wifi made wireless connection to the LAN very simple.  The TV is light enough that mounting it on the wall was easy for me to do by myself.  (Though I wouldn't try that with a larger model.)  It works well for streaming content from the 'Net and over the LAN, and that's what I got it for.  It isn't as great as my WDTVLiveHub at playing oddball file formats or recognizing foreign characters in file names, but I do like the plug-in (\"app\") architecture and the built-in web browser, and it works well enough for what I needed it for that I'm happy with my purchase.  90% of my video will play on this TV, and being able to get rid of a few cables by retiring the WDTV is a Good Thing.  Hardware-wise this is a very good TV.!!NOTE!!  Kind of off-topic, but if you're a fan of running your own video server this TV does DLNA out of the box (via \"allshare\") and there is a \"Plex\" app in the Samsung store that will let your new Samsung TV be a client to a plex server.  I've done that to allow the TV to connect to a plex server on a Synology NAS on the LAN here and it seems to work well.  (In fact, as I type this review I'm watching the TED \"channel\" from the NAS on the TV.)One thing that I've noticed on the Samsung is that the TV remote's controls feel a bit.. off.  The trackpad is great for doing things like controlling the cursor in the web browser, but it feels like the rest of the TV's software was built for a different remote without a trackpad.  Things that I can do on my LG TV in the other room with one button on the (admittedly huge) remote are sometimes just a bit more involved - or at least not as obvious - on the Samsung's more modest hand-sized remote.For the most part this is just a bit awkward however.  Nothing a software upgrade or two can't fix, and really just a nitpick.  If they fixed the file name display and expanded the list of formats playable via USB and over the LAN then I'd give it 5 stars.One thing on the wish list that would put this TV over the top for me would be to have a bluetooth (or even wired) auxiliary audio output for my hard-of-hearing mom that DOESN'T mute the speakers or disable the audio out on the back of the TV.  That way she would be able to watch TV with the rest of us by letting her adjust her private audio levels to suit her own needs without it being so loud it forces the rest of us to the other side of the room and annoys the neighbors.

What's the refresh rate, do I want 50 or 55 inch, 120 or 240 hz, and so on. The next step we often look to is Customer Reviews. We try to find someone that seems to have more expertise or \"logic\" than we do and go from there. Well I did all of the above and then decided, \"Hey, it's a Samsung!\" Gotta be good, right? So much for logic.So here's the bottom line. Once I discovered the nuances of my Samsung, dialed in the settings I wanted (don't ask, total trial and error) I could not be happier. The picture clarity is outstanding but does adjust according to the source. For instance my setting for watching a Bluray. The TV remebers that setting and then switches when I go back to TV. Pretty cool! I've found my best picture seems to come from Hulu but it could just be me. Oh, I watched football this weekend, over the air HD quality and I cannot believe the picture.Now about the 3D. It has it. Nothing exceptional there. If anyone has some ideas on what to watch or your better experience I would love to hear from you.My setup currently uses no home theater (want to contribute?). I use the latest ROKU, a Panasonic BluRay player and over the air TV. I subscribe to Netflix and HuluPlus and we have an Amazon Prime account.We recently went to NYC and the picturres from my iPhone 5 were very good on the computer.

I gave it 3 stars, but 2.5 stars would be more fitting.  This could easily be a 4-star, even a 5-star TV if not for some serious quality-control issues.  I have two small splotches on the back side of the screen glass, can't clean them.  They're slightly brown in tint, my theory is they are stray drips of adhesive.  The material that diffuses and reflects the edge-light from the LEDs is uneven, creating larger patches or \"cloudiness\" as many call it.  In addition to that, the left side of the screen has visible ripples in this material which present themselves on bright images or if I stand more than a few feet to the right of center.  Very distracting.My first impulsive response to these issues was to simply return the TV and exchange it for another.  But I had not taken the time to fully explore it yet or even wall-mount the TV, so I figured I'd do a little research and playing with the display.  I have since viewed this model at two separate Best Buy stores, as well as the next model up of Samsung 75\" -- the UN75F7100.  The two other F6400 model 75\" TV's I've viewed show the same problems.  Not identical, one of them did not seem to have the ripples, but still had the cloudiness and showed light-leakage or flashlighting in the corners -- something mine does not do.  The other had the same cloudiness and similar ripples, only on the right-hand side.  So, I fear that if I exchange the TV for another, I'll just have the same issues.  The first one without the ripples also had a visible brown \"glue spot\" on the back side of the glass.The 65\" and especially the smaller versions of this F6400 line don't seem to have the issues.  Probably easier to assemble the smaller units with the chosen screen materials.I have contacted Samsung tech support -- a worthless endeavor.  They don't have any clue what I'm talking about, but agreed my issues sound like defects and they can send out a technician for warranty repair, which I think that would be pointless.  Or I can work through my dealer (Amazon in this case) to exchange it.The F7100 model of this TV seems to use a different backing material behind the screen.  It did not exhibit the ripples or the same level of cloudiness.  But it is also 40% more expensive.  I am seriously considering sending this TV back for the F7100 model...All that said, the TV runs well.  After a few requisite adjustments -- tone down the backlight, turn off the auto-motion blur-reduction garbage, etc.. it works well.  The Smart TV features are very usable on this TV.  Netflix and Amazon instant work as good as on the new Roku boxes, although not quite as snappy.  The remote for this TV is fine in concept, but everyone in the house finds it frustrating.  We have a larger automation system in place, but don't have the new TV programmed in yet, will probably do that in the next few days.  Then I can control from my phone or tablet or whatever.  I guess I'm waiting on that to see if I'm keeping the TV.Overall, this TV had better highlight preservation and detail vs. my other potential choice -- the Sharp 80\" '857U.  The Sharp seems to do better in terms of not having splotches or ripples, but the light really falls off in the middle.  Not only that, but 75\" is the sweet spot for screen size in our family room -- 80\" would be a bit big and we're replacing an old 70\" that was fine, before it died, but a touch too small.Anyway, If there were no ripples and the cloudiness would go away, this TV would be wonderful - 4+ stars.  These large screens, or even all screens as far as I'm concerned, really need to be full-array back-lit.  Edge lit LED is always a compromise.  So now I guess I'll keep watching the TV to see if I can make peace with the clouds and ripples or if I'm going to spend another $1500 + the time it takes to swap for the next model up.  And no guarantees there either that I wouldn't have similar issues.Delivery from Amazon via Pilot Freight was simple and smooth.  Would definitely do that again.EDIT >>I had the TV swapped out.  Still some cloudiness visible on all-black or near all-black screen images, but nothing out of the ordinary for large-screen edge-lit displays.  Everything else about the replacement unit is as it should be.  This TV has a great picture overall.  I still think there are some quality control issues that Samsung needs to address and until we move away from this current trend of edge-lighting, there are going to be aspects of these TVs that are more a compromise than a great feature.  I've upgraded my review to 4 stars.  The TV would get 5 stars if they could produce sets without the clouding...One other nitpick.  The optical output on the back of the set is not in the inset port area and with a low-profile wall mount, I had to use a 90-degree adapter.  The ethernet jack is also a straight out the back ordeal, not a big deal here as I connected via wifi, but just a couple things to think about.  Curious design decisions...EDIT 2 >>There are some real annoyances about this TV that just won't go away.  It has a bad habit of reverting picture settings every now and then for no good reason.  I have to go back to the menu and re-tweak backlight and brightness and other color settings back to where I want them, along with Auto Motion settings for the horrid motion-smoothing.Annoyance #2 is the TV audio output, which I only need to use for the Smart Hub apps.  Doesn't matter if I use HDMI ARC or the optical out, results are the same with either.  All works fine, however when bringing in 5.1 channel audio from Netflix or Amazon instant video, the audio frequently drops-out for a fraction of a second and at random, but very frequent, intervals.  Only does it with 5.1 channel audio, if I go into the audio options for a Netflix movie and change from 5.1 to stereo, then it plays fine.  Samsung has acknowledged this issue -- after several attempts of getting through to someone who actually knows something.  Got one of their senior product specialists to finally acknowledge that they're aware of the problem and it affects several TV models.  However no word on if or when it will be fixed.  He seemed to want to point the finger first at my installation as the audio passes back to a Yamaha RX-A830 receiver, then at Netflix, but it happens with the Amazon app as well and presumably others.  And I have also found the same streaming audio glitch with the 55\" F9000 4K Samsung TV passing audio back to a Denon receiver.  OTOH, this is not a deal breaker for me in any way because I don't really use the apps or smart features.  We do watch a lot of Netflix, however we do it through the Oppo Blu-Ray player as it provides fully functional 5.1 audio on the Netflix titles that have it and it has superior picture decoding compared to the app in the Samsung TV.  Other systems like the PlayStation3, AppleTV and Roku all support working 5.1 audio from Netflix, not sure why Samsung is having troubles here.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture", "Author": "Thomas L Pearson", "ReviewID": "R2KQALNAOEAKDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv because I wanted to simplify my tv systems.

The screen material is shiny and I wondered if that would annoy me at certain times of the day. Auto Motion is a Samsung gimmick. It makes the picture look Soap Opera-y and text appears to shake. Not a fan of that so I turn mine off. 120Hz is more than plenty.Good:The TV is rather intuitive in terms of setup. It located my devices rather easily once plugged into HDMI. The Sony home theater in a box connected right away and the external speakers functioned well once I realized that a receiver needs to be in the ARC HDMI Port.My Comcast Box connected easily and the remote picked up some of the functions rather well. Not perfect, but gets the job done.Image overall is clear when running 720 or 1080. Standard signals don't look so great, but it is expected with such size.The built in speakers are decent for a 15by25 room with vaulted ceilings. Not much base, but it works.Bad:The default settings are not stellar. Movie is the best setting, but finding someone online reviews with settings makes the image much better.When the room is dark, there is some bleeding of light on the edges. Not terrible, but it is present.Clouding is also present with default settings when the screen is pitch black.

Little things like it auto adjusts the brightness based on how bright or dark your room is, and it works well. Streaming from Netflix and Vudu works better than expected, and there are so many other apps I cannot wait to test out.

Anyway, for what amounts to Samsung's entry level 75\" set, the F6400 is incredible. Starting with calibrated settings for an F8000 found on the AVS Forums (where I posted far more extensive thoughts and findings), the picture quality is excellent.Black levels are good to very good, motion handling very good, no clouding, and simply \"wow\" overall. I'm very pleased with the picture quality.Like all TVs these days sadly, there are a few shortcomings, primary among them is flash-lighting.  On my set it's primarily on the left edge. However, in all but the darkest 16x9 content it's not an issue, and even with dark stuff not enough for me to return the thing.  With 21x9 content it's more noticeable because of the black bars, but again not overly objectionable especially since the picture itself is so good.The other issue is that the set is fairly reflective. Have to break down and finally buy some window treatments for my room. Fortunately the room lights don't get picked up on screen, though the glossy bezel is another matter. Simply a poor choice on Samsungs part. I'm seriously toying with the idea of black felt tape over the bezel...Very happy overall!", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for...", "Author": "ssaslow", "ReviewID": "RFJ3YIOQJE9AB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchase the VIZIO E701i-A3.

I did not really want to spend almost $4k on a set but ultimately I decided to purchase this. As soon as I plugged it in and turned it on I knew I made the right decision.

This TV is replacing a 1 year old Vizio tv.I purchased the TV prior to Memorial Day so I went back and checked and Amazon is now including the Samsung Blu Tooth keyboard as a promo for customers that purchase the TV from Amazon the seller. So I called up Amazon and they comp-ted me the $89 keyboard since it was less that 14 days from when the TV shipped. Nice, very nice.The TV is very nice, colors are very nice, and due to local dimming the blacks are very dark.  Switching between cable channels is very quick, unlike the Vizio that could take up to 8 seconds.Internet access is not all it could be.  If you think you are going to watch all of your Internet streaming video on this TV it's not going to happen! I was able to stream video's from pbs.org without a problem.  But I am unable to stream the \"Ready For Love\" series from NBC.com.  The video never starts, nothing.  For me it wasn't a problem as I have an Acer W700 Windows 8 tablet that I used to stream video via HDMI at 1080 x 1920 to the TV. By the way I did install the Samsung update for this TV via the Internet so that is not the problem...I really think that the local dimming really makes the blacks really black.  Yes you will pay more for a Samsung but you really do get what you pay for.  My days of purchasing Vizio products are over.Setting up 3D, assemble glasses, insert battery.  This hardest part is figuring out that you have to hold down the sync button on the glasses until you see a message on the tv that the glasses are paired to the TV.  There really is no way to indicate that process using their picture only direction sheet!3D works OK I can detect that the lens are switching on and off but it's not really that noticeable. I really wanted passive 3D as offered by Panasonic and LG so I was intentionally not planning on purchasing a Samsung.  But when my requirements list was completed it turned out that Web surfing using a usb or blue tooth keyboard and local dimming as offered by Samsung made it an easy decision to change my mind and get this TV.  The reality is that when I had the Vizio I only watched 1 3D movie in the one year that I owned it.  So most likely I will not utilize 3D that often with this TV set.  I have read that the sync signal emanates from the bottom part of the picture frame and that having a sound bar in front of the TV will interfere with the sync signal reaching the 3D glasses.  I can report that this is not an issue with my Sony sound bar sitting in front of the TV.All in all this TV is a quality offering.  If the web browser was able to play all formats of streaming content from the Internet then this TV would have earned 5 stars.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "In home theater experience!", "Author": "G.

Arrived in 7 days with the \"free shipping\" option! Only one man showed up as his partner was sick that day, so it was my pleasure to help him out & unpack/set-up and take my time looking it all over before I signed off, without feeling rushed! Worked out great!This replaced a 2009, 52\" Sony which is now in the bedroom, and I might add still works like a champ and a picture that I'd thought I couldn't better!Not that this Samsung betters the Sony, but is newer, brighter, Bigger, and both have such great picture quality I'd hate to bet on which is better than the other!Now I got this because of the size, as I wanted a \"even more larger\" theater experience in my living room, as movie going has become much less over the past few years and Home Entertainment, with the Blu-Ray experience, and \"instant VOD features\" and streaming of films in 1080 has become my new movie going experience.Back in 2009 when I bought my Sony I was also comparing a Samsung that was my preference {which had over 850 reviews} but a common problem {s} was sound issues and the TV turning itself on/off automatically; so I opted for the Sony which hardly had any complaints!I was comparing to Sony again this time but their new model is 60\" or 70\" in 3D, but no TV stand that swivels. A swiveling stand is a must for a TV this large and Sony dropped the ball on its new releases. Plus in the 60\" and under I was to understand wasn't even an updated panel {s}. But this new 2013 Samsung is a whole new animal for 2013 even though this model is like tier three-ish.I read what little reviews I could find, visited two \"Big Box\" stores where I actual saw this 6400 model and the 6300 and could see immediately that the 6400 has blacker blacks and better viewing angles with hardly any \"wash out\". The 6300 and 6350 where looked at but has no 3D and for this kind of money and the small difference in price to have 3D which I'd never seen before, not even at the movies {that's right; haven't seen a 3d movie yet} I opted for 3D and this latest model.Ok, you're probably getting tired of my story by now so I'll get down to the nuts & bolts of this review; which is all about PICTURE PICTURE PICTURE!  And that is just as good or great as I think one can expect from any HDTV!Many TV's now have very good pictures; LG, Sharp, Panasonic, Sony, and it can be a tough call when visiting a Big Box store and start looking at em' all!In my comparisons, side by side Samsung had an edge over the rest. Plus I wanted the latest model!The media hub/Smart TV and the touch pad remote are all new to me, except my Blu Ray player has the media stuff too, the remote I've become use to already after just a few days and works well, but there are so many options to picture that until I \"bone up\" on all these new facets, I'll just stick to what looks \"good to me\".The sound I have no complaint about as nothing obvious sticks out or sounds bad to my ears. I have my stereo system I'll be hooking up later for those Blu Ray movies but day to day, it'll just be the TV speakers!That's about it, picture and sound. Smart hub and more features than I'll ever use! {my wireless was found during set-up and haven't had a re-buffer as of yet with over 10 hours on Netflix}The looks and design are very nice, and the TV stand is well spread out on four \"spider legs\" that seems very stable and measures 32\" long X 15\" wide, holding a TV that's about 58\" long and 2\" deep! But living in California I have plastic chain {doesn't conduct electricity} and toggle bolts in the wall all hooked to the back just in case the Terra firma ain't so Terra firma one day in the future!My living room is about 22' in length with chairs or sofa at either end and I can turn this TV enough to watch from either end without loss of quality on viewing angle.All in all, I'm a happy camper at present and hope to continue to be.But... on electronics I always go for and extending warrantee.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV.

Unfortunately my mounting bracket pulled out of the cheap sheet rock in my house, and that TV was destroyed. This was bought as a replacement. First let me touch on the 3D stuff. I've only toyed with it a bit and I think it's little more than a gimmick. But the glasses provided synced up with the TV quickly (once I read the manual - DUH!) and the effect is very vivid, to say the least. What really impressed me about this TV though is how much better the 2D is compared to the TV that dropped off the wall. That TV was no slouch by any means, but this one seems to have much more vivid hues and looks so much better for high action movies and sports that I suspected they slipped me a 240Hz by mistake.I also use this as my PC monitor and it is spectacular in that regard. Nothing like 40\" to make you forget your eyes are getting older. I like to play a couple games (Diablo III and Torchlight II) and the old TV would show some \"jaggies\" when the action was getting really intense. No such problem with this monitor.

This is NOT a bad thing since it was easy to locate the settings and change.The hardest part to get used to was the VERY small remote. It has a rather serious lack of buttons most of which are replaced with a touch pad. Once I got used to it I was rather surprised at how well it works.

It recommends having two people to set it up but I couldn't wait and did it by my self. After removing the obvious bits from the top of the carton I laid the box down with the front of the TV facing the floor. I then cut the back of the box away from the sides and bottom to get it out of the way. With the carton laying on the box my TV stand was shipped in I attached the bottom stand and then gently lifted the TV to an upright position.Once it's in this position you can squat, pick it up from the bottom edge with the edge in your palms and place it on your TV stand without worrying about mashing the front with your fingers.

I'm very pleased with the quality of the picture, and it is stunning on a 75\" tv.  Watching a Blue Ray or even streaming HD content is superb.  We are coming from a 55\" LG Plasma, so we do notice a bit of a dim look during the day, or when there is ambient light in the room.  Still not a problem, because if we watched more during the day, the settings can be nuanced to make up for the room lighting.  Not too interested in the 3D, but it is a fun novelty. We tried it with the glasses, and they are actually more comfortable than I expected.  There is not much 3d content available, so we'll probably lose the glasses before we try it again.  The reason I dinged a star on my review, is the remote.  I think Samsung missed the mark with this overly complicated, non-intuitive, too smart for it's own good remote.  Someone said they couldn't access their cable box with it, and that is no longer the case.  However, in order to access your channel line up from your provider, it takes four steps from the first screen to where you are seeing your normal channel guide.  If you try to use the channel list available without accessing your provider's guide, you end up being thrown back to the first channel on the guide every time you exit your current choice.  I'm getting used to it, but one of my kids was so frustrated, that we worked on re-programming our original cable company's remote until now that is all we need to use.

There was nothing wrong with that set, it's just the advances made in HDTV sets in that time span (not to mention the massive price drops) made it clear that it was time to upgrade.First - picture quality is amazing after toying with some of the picture settings. Everything is super sharp, and sometimes even 2D images pop off the screen. But please do humanity a favor and disable \"Auto Motion Plus\" as soon as you turn this TV on. Or at least know that you shouldn't watch films with this setting on. It produces the dreaded Soap Opera Effect and will cheapen the look of all those nice Blu Rays you bought, and annoy your friends. Just turn it off. Now. Thanks.Second - 3D. I'm not the biggest believer in 3D, but I figured I play enough games that it might be something I want in the future. Not to mention that Samsung TV's are one of the few groups of devices that can play Netflix 3D movies. So as long as you already have a Netflix account, right off the bat you have a pretty hefty library of 3D films to choose from. And the 3D on this TV truly is amazing. Very little ghosting effect, and even when there is ghosting, your eyes sort of tune it out after adjusting to the picture. I also discovered by accident that this TV can convert any 2D image into 3D. It's a novelty effect that I doubt I'll utilize often for regular TV, but for video games that don't actually display in 3D, this is a really amazing feature. I was playing Call of Duty: Ghosts on the Wii U in 3D for a couple hours yesterday and it was pretty impressive. Of course, because it's converting 2D to 3D, sometimes the effect is a little weird, and watching native 3D content will always be better.Third - SmartHub is a little slow to load menu items. But I haven't run into any problems streaming Netflix, HBO Go or Amazon Instant. Once I start a movie, it plays seamlessly in beautiful HD. There is a nice selection of apps, and I could definitely see the Samsung App store do some amazing things. Fingers crossed for a Philips Hue integration app.Fourth - The remote. It's not a bad remote, but I really have no use for it as I use a Harmony Smart Control remote already. I've tried the voice control a couple times, and it works, but I doubt I'll ever use it in my day-to-day life.Overall, I'm truly happy I went with this set.

I previously had a top of the line Samsung Plasma and this LED blows the doors of the picture on my plasma. I never thought I would use the Smart TV features because I have a Tivo and a Western Digital TV live hub media center already on my network.  Boy was I wrong.  The smarthub interface on the TV is great and I use it every day.  I can see all of my digital media on my network through the Smart Hub interface. Further, I have PLEX installed on my network and I downloaded the PLEX app for smart hub and this combination is fantastic. PLEX allows me to see all my digital media on my Western Digital Live Hub as well as on my computer all in one place.  PLEX automatically downloads all of the Movie info from the Web for all of my digital movie files so I am presented with a \"Netflix like\" menu of all of my movies through the PLEX app.  The interface to Vudu and netflix is also top notch.  Much better interface than watching from my Tivo or my Western Digital. The only thing I can think to write that is negative at all is the sound from the TV internal speakers is just okay. I run everything through a digital receiver attached to a surround sound system so this is not an issue for me.  If you are debating about buying this TV, just go ahead and do it.

Although the web browser works adequately, this is not a computer or laptop.  We purchased the additional wireless keyboard, but there can be a frustrating lag on response time, the browser's interface is clunky,and we find we are still going back to our laptop for any serious internet searching or communication.  Frankly, the standard remote that comes with the 6400 is so intuitive and good that the separate keyboard is probably not needed for just internet searches, etc.2.  As we already subscribe to a cable package (Xfinity) and did not want to have to pay another $10+ a month just to get the cable to work directly on this TV, we had hoped to view all our channels instead through the internet (as we can do on our laptops or desktops).  However, this TV runs on the Linux operating system, and comes with Adobe Flash 11.2 installed.  The Xfinity internet viewing app requires the latest version of Flash (11.8) for most of the channels to work.  However, according to the Adobe website (and our numerous attempts to download the latest version of Flash), Adobe is not supporting Linux beyond the 11.2 version -- which means we can't use the Xfinity app on this TV!  There is probably some workaround we haven't figured out (like slinging the signal from a laptop), but the lack of upgrades to Flash is frustrating.Picture quality is amazing, and there is plenty of content otherwise available through its Wi-Fi connectivity, but if you are considering this TV for its Wi-Fi enabled internet experience, recognize that there are some limitations to what you will be able to do online.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Grand Centerpiece to the Home Theater Extravaganza Experience", "Author": "Maximus", "ReviewID": "R17MCAW98HB1SR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tv about 6 months ago through Amazon, so here is a write-up with 6 months of experience with it:The picture quality is excellent, the best I've ever had.  I highly recommend Samsung, I previously bought a 50 inch 2012 Samsung for the bedroom and have been very happy with it.  I did a lot of research and decided to go with the 6400 model.  I think this is a great value model, because this model is the lowest priced model that starts  including a lot of the upper end features.  I also recommend getting the 3D tv even if you're not going to use the 3D.  I read somewhere where the 3D tvs put a higher demand on the video processing, so the tvs are forced to have higher grade processors to compensate.The picture quality for regular TV is excellent.  We've only watched one 3D movie so far--Avatar.  An unbelievable spectacular visual experience.  I had seen the movie in the theater without 3D and was not that impressed.  Having watched it in 3D, I now understood why it's the no. 1 movie of all time--it's the visual effects.We use the Smart TV functions every so often.  The one we use most is Amazon Prime for streaming movies.  We've had mixed response, mainly because our internet connection through the phone company is slow and irregular.  Sometimes it's smooth and there are no interruptions through the movie, other times it is start and stop, which gets annoying.  Once we get an internet connection that matches the technology, that will be great.I've found the voice control to be more useful than the motion control.  The cool thing about the voice control is if you don't know the channel number of a certain channel, you simply speak the name of the channel into the remote and it finds it for you.  Much better than spending time going through the directv channel guide, assuming you can find the channel guide.One other point that needs to be mentioned--the remote control.  It's different than older remotes--there are no numbers on it like most older models, just a touch pad.  I've had no complaints with that radical departure, but to be honest with you, we never use it unless we go to the smart tv.  For regular tv, we control the channels with the directv remote and the volume with my receiver remote.The only reason I am not giving this tv 5 stars is because we had remote control problems.  At first it would not work every so often, then it stopped working completely.  I called up tech. support, and they sent us a new one, no problems ever since.  This mostly concerned our Smart Tv experience.I also recommend getting the Samsung wireless keyboard if you plan to surf the web with this tv.  Moving the cursor over the letters to spell things out gets really annoying in a short period of time.This tv was the final piece in our revamped home theater experience.  We've been very satisfied with it.  I highly recommend this tv if you want to get value and features--a medium priced tv that has many of the upper end features.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great investment for gamers", "Author": "Tyler Higgins", "ReviewID": "R3GDTMHH9K3J6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this smart TV.

The horizontal dimension limits what you can get in there.  This 50 inch with the tiny bezel allowed me put fit this 50 inch in this space.  The 55 was close to fitting but just too snug,  This was the perfect fit.The entire set up including attaching the stand, tweaking the picture, getting online, and updated was under 30 minutes!  Everything was very easy.  I just connected my Directv receiver and 3d blu ray and I was done.The picture is astounding.  While I use Dynamic for the picture, I toned down the contrast and brighness quite a bit.  Several people have viewed this TV and couldn't believe it was only 1097.  I tried viewing a 3d movie and it was better than the other 3d tv's I've had.The included two pair of glasses were very lightweight and functioned great.  My only complaint is the lenses are too small to fit over my glasses.I'm not too keen on the apps and netflix, but for viewing TV shows and blu rays disks, it is just plain amazing.The pad type remote takes a little get used to, but it's no problem once you get the gist of it.Update 8-5-13.....I'm very unhappy with a small aspect of this tv that most people will say is not important but it is to me. I cannot program my Directv remote to turn the TV on or off, or move the volume up or down.  25 codes entered and none work.  Directv says Samsung supplied the codes to them and if none work call them.  Of course Samsung says it's Directv;s fault and they have no other codes.

I had a 37 inch LG since 2008 and craved a bigger screen.  I rarely write reviews, but there are some things that you should be aware of before purchasing the Samsung F6400.1.) If you have Comcast (I live in Chicago) then they don't support the HBO GO streaming app.  Comcast also doesn't support the Nat Geo app and probably some others.  Basically you are paying Comcast for HBO, but Comcast can deny you rights / licensing to stream content through the HBO GO app on Samsung TVs.  I heard that it is the same for Roku players.  Search the internet to see if your cable provided is blocking this content if you are concerned.2.) The viewing angle is pretty narrow on this TV.  I have the 50 inch.  If you take one step from the center you will notice a significant drop in color saturation, contrast, and black levels.  The image becomes pretty flat unless you are viewing front and center.3.) WiFi receiver is pretty weak.  I have an Apple Airport Extreme sitting right next to the TV.  But most of the time the Smart content takes moments to pop up.  Half the time, the channel guide will spin for a while before it loads, making it not very useful.  Netflix will also have trouble streaming.  It will stop and buffer and the video quality dips often.  I plugged in an ethernet cable for a solid LAN connection and it 100% fixed this problem.  Once it was connected via ethernet, Netflix looked great.4.) You have no way to customize the television content in the Smart Hub.  It shows you what programs are on and it is supposed to learn and evolve based on what you watch.  But it tends to just show the big 4 channels and some family content.  It would be amazing if I could manually set my favorite 12 channels to populate the main hub screen.  But instead it is kind of useless.  Nicely designed, but worthless.5.) The guide is a nice idea.  It can replace your current cable box guide.  The Samsung IR blaster works very well in fact. I have Comcast and the onscreen guide is fairly ugly.  But with the Comcast box, you can set favorites and customize menus.  Once again, you have no control over customizing the Samsung onscreen guide.  There is no way to set favorites or filter out non-HD channels.Other then that....The picture is pretty good besides the viewing angle issues.There is some really deep control over the picture settings.  So you can finely calibrate the screen.  CNET has great picture settings for this TV.I have Comcast and a PS4 hooked up via HDMI.  Both look fantastic.No 'Soap Opera Effect\" if you don't want it.  The image looks the way it was supposed to be seen. This TV handles motion extremely well with out making things look cheap.

I love the Galaxy note series phones, and have a refrigerator from them.  With that said I was excited to get a new, and my first, smart tv.After using the tv for about 2 months I've discovered the following weaknesses:1) The wireless doesn't work well.  My laptop wireless works great if I set it next to the tv, but the tv has a weaker signal/connection to my home network. Many people have reported problems with the wireless and I finally went to the trouble of ordering a $30 bridge (Edimax N300) so that the tv has a wired connection.  After installing the bridge it became clear that the problem isn't in any other part of my wireless network in the house and the tv now connects well to the internet.2) The TV is SLOW to keep up with commands from the remote.  I've timed it and it can be a delay of up to 10 seconds.  As an example, let's say I want to go to netflix.  I navigate the onscreen menu, but the tv reacts slowly.  When I finally click on netflix I discover that I had pressed and additional downarrow command that the tv hasn't processed yet so it moves off of netflix to the web browser app and then processes the click command (which I thought was to launch netflix).  Maybe they need to include a faster processor in this tv?3) This is a small issue, but the on/off button is directly above the volume buttons on the remote.  So you connect to netflix and go to raise the volume and find out that you've just turned off the tv.  BUMMER!  Now I restart the tv, navigate to netflix and restart netflix...  Yes, I hit the wrong button, but come on, somebody must have thought through the layout of the remote and said what if some lazy guy is laying on the couch navigating around without great cerebral effort?  Well it's hit and miss for this fellow!With all that said, I do like many of the features of the tv.  The remote has an interesting design and works well for many tasks.

Being a long time Samsung user, and having been blown away by previous products, I guess my expectations were set so high that I was not as impressed initially. Don't get me wrong, it has nothing to do with the TV. First of all, I had a working 46Inch 6000 series LED TV which still works flawlessly but needed a bigger TV for the living room. When I connected my satellite receiver to the new 60Inch 6400 series TV, I instantly noticed a somewhat reduction in clarity. I did a few tweaking here and there, but there was no difference. But when I connected a rabbit ear antenna to the TV, the over the air transmission came out beautifully. I then concluded that the signal compression applied by the satellite transmission guys did not do the TV justice.The 3D effect is good, though I rarely set it in 3d mode. I have been able to stream movies from Amazon, home media server, USB stick, external Hard Drive etc and it has worked flawlessly. I have also been able to connect a wireless Keyboard with touch pad (I bought over 5 years ago) to the TV and it worked perfectly.

Boo...I bought the Samsung UN556400 55-inch to replace an old 50 Samsung plasma (PN50B450B1DXZA). My old Samsung had what I call an analog universal remote. I could quickly click any of the buttons. However, the new TV comes with the 'Smart Touch Remote.' Since I got a new Smart TV, I wanted to take advantage of the new features.However, before I get into that, let me explain how my old TV was setup. I had and still have Comcast as a cable provider. In my old setup, I primarily used the Comcast universal remote since I could quickly bring up the channel guide, on-demand, DVR, etc. I would use my old Samsung remote if I wanted to change the source on the TV.With the new Samsung remote on this new TV, bringing up the smart Samsung Guide is sort of a pain. If you click on the 'Guide' button, it defaults to channel 1. I can't seem to figure out if there's a feature to only bring up only the HD channels in the Samsung version of the channel guide. So now I have to scroll backwards through the 900s and 800s to get the HD channels. The on-screen help says I can quickly skip multiple channels by clicking on the \"virtual\" A button. However bringing up the virtual remote on the screen seems a little cumbersome. With the Comcast and analog remotes, the buttons are readily available to be clicked. With the virtual remote, you have to swipe between screens to get be able to select the proper buttons.If you want to go directly to a specific channel, you can click on the right hand side of the touch pad. Then you can swipe the numeric channels. It's hit or miss. Sometimes it recognizes the numbers and sometimes it doesn't. With the old analog universal remote, you simply push the buttons. I wish the TV came with a better remote that had the new Smart Touch features but also some additional old screen buttons.I also know someone that bought a Samsung LED over the holidays. They opted for a 60\" LED but an older generation. It was also a Smart Hub TV. I have to say my Smart Hub came up a lot quicker and was a lot easier to configure. A lot of the common apps were already pre-configured. With the other Samsung LED TV I saw, she had to manually download some apps (i.e.: Youtube) since it wasn't pre-installed.As for the picture quality, the 1080p certainly beats out my old 720i plasma. The picture looks pretty good and haven't had any issues with it. As for the 3D, I played with it for the first two days and lost complete interest in it. One pair of glasses is still in the plastic packaging.Some PROs:* Samsung has an iPhone app to control the TV* It syncs nicely with other Anynet+ hardware (I tested with a Samsung Sound Bar)Some CONs:* The web browser and various Smart Hub features are a little slow and clunky in design* The default display setting almost made me return the TV. I had to change it to Natural since the default setting seemed really, really dim. I thought I got a lemon of a TV.* Some random resets when playing with the Smart Hub features. Meaning the screen will turn black and seems like a quick reset.Still to Play With (and hopefully some updates in the feature):* Compare streaming quality (i.e.: Amazon Prime, Netflix, Vudu)* Ponder to buy a blu-ray player or just subscribe to streaming services only for the best quality video* Debate if I should just go back to the analog Comcast remote and deal with using two remotes", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Peggy M.

Coming from a Samsung TV, I knew what to expect in terms of picture quality and stuff and I was not disappointed. On the smart TV front, I discovered quite a few things and I shall discuss them here.1. The picture quality is second to none2. In-built wi-fi: makes it easy to connect this TV to your home network. Although, I found out later that its best to use an ethernet cable if you plan to stream netflix/hulu3. Smart hub: is a cool idea but probably needs a bit more work... it can be slow to respond from time to time4. Apps like the screensavers and wallpapers are cool for showing off5. Weather app is very slow and unusable6. Smart/Eco features like auto-dimming based on surrounding light is cool7. TV Remote with is touchpad/clickpad is AWESOME: makes navigating the smart hub as well as surfing channels a pleasure8. TV is so thin that wall-mounting it is the only way to do justice to it9. The screen is less glossy than my previous Samsung LCD10. Screen mirroring is cool when it works: has a tendency to freeze or drop connection from time to timeAll in all, I love this TV for its gigantic size and excellent picture quality.

I needed something that was 50\".  3D was a plus but not necessary. Didn't care for SmartTVs but all TVs of this caliber are SmartTVs.After really considering a number of TVs found on Amazon (Plasmas & LEDs), I decided to go with the Samsung over other competitive brands/models (Panasonic, LG, Sony). Plus, I got a free Samsung 3D Bluray player through the deal as well so check if it is still available!In the week and half that I have owned it... I have not been disappointed.Pros:-Picture quality is awesome!-There is a lot of control with colors as well so you can find a preset that fits you or custom one.-Setup was super easy and the process when you turn on the TV is step by step.-Audio is pretty damn good alone (not perfect, but if you get a TV like this then you should at least get a 2.1 sound system)-3D quality is great! I was not interested in 3D that much but so far the two movies I have seen through it have exceeded my expectations.-Uses active 3D glasses-Super thin and the fact that is competitive LED screen when compared to Plasmas-Fair price for what you get (The 50\" model was competitive and only $100 more than a Panasonic model I almost bought)Cons:-Difficult to plug in with standard wall mount (extended are no problems) given plugs locations.  (I can survive)-Comes with only 2 active 3D glasses. I will probably want around 4-6 for larger parties. This may be good though since there are better Samsung compatible glasses on Amazon.If you are in the market for a new TV and have a $1200 budget then consider this Samsung a must. Don't believe me? Read the other reviews.

The standard picture is fantastic and the 3D was stunning. The set up was pretty straightforward.  I ran into one small issue when I was doing setup, but I got past that pretty quickly.  I was impressed by the remote as well.  They've really done quite a job with this one.  3D was really a no brainer unlike a passive 3D LG that I was trying to help get to work a few months ago.  I did buy a Samsung sound bar system to use the ARC HDMI and a Samsung bly ray player to avoid compatibility issues, so I don't know how well the TV might work with other equipment.I mounted this one on the wall with a Cheetah Mount and that was a bit of a challenge, but it came out great and mounting on the wall frees up so much space.  In retrospect I may have rather chosen to have it installed because I ended up having to buy metric ratchets to get the mount on.  Note that the TV comes with inserts for the four points to bolt into on the back of the TV that you will need to put in before attaching the mount to the back of the TV. I didn't notice this at first and wondered why the mount didn't fit well on the TVAll in all, I'm a very happy customer with this TV.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful", "Author": "Richard Roush \"Adams Addict\"", "ReviewID": "R2T9AWCMPV0PFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has excellent picture quality and looks very good.  I like the thin border design.  Setup was easy.  I have it attached to a Yamaha stereo receiver and Polk 5.1 speaker system, so I'm not using the TV's speakers.  The remote was a bit of a shock, but it turns out to be fairly easy to get used to and I haven't had any real problems with it.  It would have been nice to have a numerical keypad though to be able to jump directly to stations.Based on recent events, I can no longer recommend this or any other Samsung TV.  I have owned two of them- this one and a 46 inch model.  The day this TV was delivered, the main board on the 46 inch set failed.  It started displaying fine vertical lines of color across the full screen.  I replaced it with an LG 46 inch set.  Now, this 55 inch Samsung has gone bad.  My smart remote was not connecting with the TV.  I could turn the set on or off, but that was about it.  I couldn't switch from Cable to satellite, and when I turned the set on, I couldn't expand the Smart Hub window to full screen that was displaying the programming the TV was currently tuned to.  A Samsung technician has just left my home after replacing the main board in this set, which is only a few months old and has received very little use until recently.  He also had to replace the toggle button on the back of the set which allows you to control menu settings when the blue tooth functions of the smart remote are not working.  It's a nice TV when it's working.  Great picture, but sadly, Samsung is now 0 for 2, and that is unacceptable.One other point I should mention.  The technician told me my set should have come with a traditional keypad style remote in addition to the touchpad smart remote.  It did not.  I don't know if Samsung forgot to pack it or if someone from the seller removed the keypad remote from the packaging before shipment.  The touch pad smart remote takes some  getting used to.  If the keypad remote had been included, I would almost certainly have been using it to control the TV and might never have noticed that the touchpad remote's blue tooth features were inoperable.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice 65 inch screen, 3d looks awesome to me", "Author": "A.B.", "ReviewID": "RUUHHYCWETCLE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV is working fine.

I had an LG tv before this on the same network and never had an experience, so this makes me think it's a software issue with the Samsung tvs. In the end, I've had to hook up a smart dvd player to use these apps, completely negating the purpose of getting a smart tv.

The picture quality of the samsung plasma that i had was good, but the 65in is simply superb! just beyond my expectations.the smart tv was a little difficult to set up at the beginning, i didn't realize that you actually need to register w/ samsung first, before you can view the youtube videos and all the other contents.one little complain that i have: using the smart remote to type is simply a pain, you had to use your thumb to pick out each letter that you want to type on the screen's keyboard.  I mean when customers shed out almost 2 grand for a tv, we kinda demand perfection.  And there has to be a better way to type a url using the smart remote control.  If i really had a choice, i would have given a 4.5 rating instead of the 5/5.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good HDTV but not smart enough", "Author": "nysuka", "ReviewID": "RB44IFCI8U842", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Setup is easy, detects wifi, bluetooth pairing with keyboard and mouse, and 3D glasses with no issue. Popular apps like Netflix, Amazon, YouTube work well. Some reviewers complained about the stand being flimsy, but it is a fixed stand with no degree of freedom for swiveling so as long as the tv isn't moved too frequently, the stand should be stable enough, plus the tv isn't too heavy. Other reviewers mentioned the remote being difficult to use, but I find the design intuitive and its small (smaller than iphone).My main complaint is the browser, which is very slow, unresponsive sometimes, and playing flash video will sometimes cause the tv to reboot on its own. After some research, it turns out this sudden reboot happens when the tv runs out of memory. Also, free version of hulu.com will not play on the browser at all, displays error saying platform not supported. This is disappointing for a \"smart tv\".

My old tv is a 50\" Samsung plasma 720p. I'm still very happy with it and wasn't sure if I should get another plasma or this one. What made me get this one is where I would be placing it, in a room next to a sunroom, which had a lot of light in it. Since the LEDs are better suited for that, I went that route. I love the fact that is came with built-in WIFI so hooking it up to the LAN was a breeze and it can see my NAS drive, etc. I'm still adjusting to the touchpad remote, but its ok I guess, and kind of necessary to navigate and especially browse the web,etc. Watching videos, especially with lots of motion, looks spectacular. Motions look so fluid and realistic almost like its in 3d. I believe this is due to the 120hz refresh. I use the tv for mostly over the air antenna to watch local stations in HD and Netflix. I'm really looking forward to trying out the 3d, which is a feature that I almost didn't realize came with this tv. It definitely wouldn't be something I pay extra for but now that I have it, I will check it out. The tv is relatively light for its size and also pretty thin. I have it mounted on a wall with a Cheetah 32-55 inch articulating wall mount which I also purchased on Amazon.

I found the MOVIE picture setting to be the best with the Auto Motion Plus (only if you are viewing in 2D) turned off. The picture quality does suffer if you are viewing it from too severe a side angle so this is a TV that is best viewed from front angles. The 2D to 3D conversion feature is also nice in that it actually produces acceptable viewing results. Another nice feature is that this TV has ample ports for HDMI, USB, and Audio Out.The sound quality I cannot comment on as I run it through my Yamaha Receiver to external speakers. I will say though that this TV does have a design flaw with how it handles input signals. If I run the input signal directly from my DISH Receiver to the TV, I get both picture and sound. However, if I run the DISH Receiver to my Yamaha Receiver and then to the TV, the TV will only get the picture. Thus, if you want to utilize an external receiver along with retaining the ability for this TV to produce sound, you are limited to the following setup: DISH Receiver to Samsung TV to External Receiver.The remote control too has the same issue. If you want it to control your DISH Receiver, you must have the same setup wherein the DISH is connected directly to the TV.Nonetheless, all in all this is a very good TV for the price.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Image quality is great!", "Author": "Mildred", "ReviewID": "RPPTUQBIE74XD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Me and my husband were both satisfied with the image quality especially when we are using the 3D and pair it with our Samsung Bluray 3D player and 3D glasses it feels like we are in a theater!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV (edited)", "Author": "N. Abels", "ReviewID": "R2J2FELU3LH3L3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a really nice TV. It's natively compatible with a lot of file types, and using Plex and Mezzmo as media streamers has been a breeze. The picture quality is also great, and the WiFi connects to everything seamlessly. Really, the only problem is that the semi-matte finish used on the screen reflects a moderate amount of light. Although the higher end Samsung models use a different, clear-coat finish, I've read articles that indicate it's still an issue there too. As with my monitor, I would have preferred if they had sacrificed some screen clarity for less glare.Besides that, there are a few quirks. When loading the Smart Hub, there's some noticeable lag, and it's annoying how you can't change the volume while browsing through menus. The remote is also kind of difficult to use and lacking in functionality. These aren't big issues though, and some of them may be fixable with software updates.Edit: I took a star off due to screen uniformity issues after noticing dark corners. It's easy to make out these kinds of backlighting problems if you take a picture of the TV while a white image is displayed (that covers the entire screen) and then compare it to a picture of the TV after selecting 'setup' from the menu options. I was already aware that all four corners of my screen were too dark during lightly colored scenes, but hadn't noticed other uniformity issues, such as darkness creeping across the bottom middle. Using Google, it seems this started becoming a problem around 2009, when Samsung was first introducing edge-lit TVs. I'm having a technician replace the screen, and will update then.Edit 2: The tech came and replaced the screen. He noted that the manufacturing number of the replacement screen wasn't the same as the original screen, meaning it may be updated somehow. The darkness in the corners is still noticeable to an extent, but much less so than before. I'm still leaving a star off because the many cheap Vizio's in my bedrooms have flawless backlighting and uniformity, meaning it's a goal that should be attainable.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good TV, crappy remote.", "Author": "Ko", "ReviewID": "R1FFYCSTQYSWB4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The images are bright, clean, and crisp.

Sound from the stock speakers is terrible on this Samsung so you do need a separate set up like a sound bar at the least.  The one issue I don't like, and why I removed one star, is that there is a \"ghosting\" or \"light bleed\" issue when viewing in a very dark room.  It is not an issue during scenes that are bright or just normal but if a scene in a movie or show is very dark I can see blotches of light in certain areas.  The areas don't change so it is the tv, and my settings are not excessively bright although when I turned them down it helped a little but I like a bright screen.

The first flat panel that I bought is a Samsung LN40 series and does not have smart capabilities but is a very nice HD tv.  So when something works great keep supporting the company.  Correct?  The UN 46 is has very pretty picture and great HD as long as you are looking at it straight on. If you move about 20 degrees to either side the picture quality is not as good and the definitions lightens up.  The LN40 has a side view that is much greater somewhere about 70 degrees.  The sound on the UN46 is a touch better than the LN40 but I use a surround sound system and this does not matter but just stating. The smart is remote is very nice and well designed and easy to navigate. The 3D ability is okay, not much on 3D but fun to play with.  My biggest kicker is the web browser. This is a proprietary browser and does not support Adobe Flash.  When contacting Samsung, I get no good answer other than just \"Samsung web browser does not use all formats.\"  As asked, \"Why\"?  No answer can be given.  So if you want to watch sports on NBC Sports \"Live Events\", then forget it.

Clearly it is a Smart HDTV which means it is not like your average HDTV. This behemoth comes with built-in Wifi, a wonderful SmartHub Menu, a camera mounted onto the top of the TV and much more!However, I must warn you, times have changed when I got this TV and wrote my review. It appears that most models DO NOT come with a HD camera mounted on the TV according to the picture. Please keep that in mind. My model had integrated Skype as well. I cannot tell you much about this portion, but I can GUARANTEE that it is not even important compared to the awesome power this TV has to offer.If you ever feel that your Smart TV is getting outdated by the newer Smart TV's in Samsung's arsenal, don't worry about it too much. The most amazing part of this TV is that it has a slot for an Evolution Kit. This kit automatically upgrades your TV to the latest dashboard, and installs all of the new features that current-gen Smart TV's offer! Now note that the Evolution Kit does not come supplied with your TV and you may have to pay 100-300 dollars to grab one. If you think about it, I would rather pay a few extra hundreds rather than spend 2000 dollars on a new TV altogether.The Wifi is what makes this TV an awesome entertainment center. This unlocks all the features in the Smart Hub menu. The smart hub menu is easily accessed on the Samsung remote they provide you. It's the button in the shape of a diamond with a vast amount of colours. Once a Wifi connection has been established, you can enjoy some awesome apps such as Youtube, Fitness Center, and even Angry Birds! Another cool feature is that the TV has an IR blaster that is placed on the bottom of the TV and it senses your movement. So pretty much to play Angry Birds, you just swipe your hand and watch the Carnage.Please keep in mind that if this TV does not come with a camera then this feature may not apply, but it seem that it has been implemented in a whole new way.You will also have the benefit to watch 3D movies, and what better way to experience your first glimpse of 3D with its personal 3D template video. It also comes with 4 3D glasses as well as an HDMI cable.What are you waiting for? There is no excuse to not buy this TV and even if two of the previous features I mentioned are obsolete at this point, by the time I have written this review, This HDTV is by far the best one you can have and I have had no problems with it whatsoever.

The enhanced delivery was a whirl wind as they came in, put the box down on the floor, took the top of the box off and were asking where to plug it in before I had a chance to look at anything.  They didn't set it up, they just took the upper box off and left it standing in the packaging.  Plugged it in, said, yep it works, here is your remote, sign here, and they were out the door.Then, when I went to set it up, I took it out of the packaging, laid it on the floor and found the stand.  But not the screws for the stand.  Nowhere to be found.  Check the directions, and they should be attached to the packaging.  Again, no where to be found.  Called Samsung.  24:38 later, I have given extensive information and filed a service claim so that the screws can be shipped to me, UPS ground in 3-5 days with another 3-5 days for delivery. Oh, that is after I send them proof of purchase.  I guess there are folks stealing screws.  Anyway, I mentioned that they might want to overnight them, since this is a big expensive TV, and they might want to treat a customer well.  I then got the \"sorry, nothing I can do\".  To which I replied, sure you can.  I bet Samsung uses Fed Ex all the time, they just choose not to here.  To her credit, she agreed with me.  Now we will see how long until the screws arrive.Amazon to the rescue.  Called Amazon tech support even those this wasn't a technical issue.  Sure enough, they knew the screw size, told me I could pick it up at any hardware store, and they would call back in 2 days and credit me the cost.  What a difference in customer support between Amazon and Samsung! Quick trip to Home Depot and I was all set.Automated set up program was quick and intuitive.  Smart controller takes a little getting used to, but I think it is going to be much faster scrolling through movies and the like.  I have the other controller on another TV and I like it, but I think I am going to grow to like this one better.Remote synched to my set top box with no problem.

This green line is visible regardless of input as well as during power on/off. I contacted Samsung about this issue through their web site and haven't been thrilled with their support.After creating a Samsung account, registering my television, and filling out a detailed service request form (which ended up taking ~1 hour), I received a call from a Samsung rep on my office line on a Sunday afternoon (which I missed as I was not in the office).

I use this TV in my bedroom. The picture quality is good but the design could have been much better!  First, the foot stand takes up quite a large space and doesn't look that great, I called Samsung to inquire if another foot stand would fit, Samsung's answer was to use the foot stand that came with the TV. The TV can be wall mounted. Second, the only control on the TV itself is the power button which is stupidly located on the back of the TV, without the remote control there is no control of the TV.  If you connect a keyboard and mouse which I have done there is some control but cumbersome. Third, the remote control is too super sensitive, just reaching for the remote and touching the touch pad can make a video you are watching, for example from Amazon, scroll to another location in the video, quite annoying! I have two other TVs that out perform this Samsung TV, a VIZIO TV and a Toshiba TV.  I feel I paid way too much for the Samsung TV but dummy me threw the box away, feeling the Samsung TV would be a quality product that I wouldn't have to return, I was wrong . The 3D quality is nowhere near that of my VIZIO TV, which really is not that much of a factor for me since I do not watch very much 3D content, but since you may watch more 3D content I have commented on the 3D performance here.

I was worried that the black levels wouldn't be as good as I had hoped, but I was pleasantly surprised when I got the TV up and going.  I considered plasmas, but ended up with an LED to do something different.  As much as I would like the deeper blacks and more detail with the brightness down in dark scenes, this LED TV absolutely stands right with my old (keyword: old) plasma in that respect.This is my first 3D TV, but I have watched other (more expensive) 3D TV's that were easily double the cost of this one (2 years ago) and this is definitely as good in my opinion of the more expensive TV of a couple years ago.  There is always trade-offs with a cheaper TV, but Samsung packed a ton of features in the mid-range priced 3D smart TV.  The micro-dimming seems to work pretty well as I haven't been distracted much by dark scenes in the 4 or 5 blu rays that I have watched through it so far.  Playing Assassins Creed Black Flag on xbox one did cause me to have to turn the brightness and backlight up a little bit to see what I was doing in the very dark missions.Samsung smart hub works great on this TV and using for Netflix and Vudu mostly so far has worked fantastic.  Once you fine a happy medium with the automotion feature by using the 'custom' option,  you can make the picture smoother without having too much of the 'soap opera' effect.The TV came with a free HWF450 soundbar which seamlessly links to the TV via Bluetooth, so no wires between the two and all of my other devices play straight through the soundbar/subwoofer with no effort.  Screen mirroring with my galaxy s4 works mostly well, every now and again there is a hiccup, but nothing major.tl:drAll-in-all, this TV does absolutely everything that I need it to do and I'm glad that I upped my price range from the $800 area to this one, plus with the free soundbar promotion I could not pass it up and I have to say that I'm very pleased with my purchase.  There are better TV's out there, but they come with a premium and I cannot justify spending more on a television at this time.

Newman \"Torah Addict\"", "ReviewID": "R3P2MM5217AXWQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this 3D HD TV on Amazon on June 30, 2013 for two reasons.  I needed a high end 40\" 3D HD TV and Samsung seemed to be the only one that had all the bells and whistles and was 40\".  There were very few purportedly excellent 3D HD TV's that were 40\" in size.  I inherited a very nice but old entertainment unit and the largest TV it could contain was a 40\".  I already had a fantastic Sony 3D LED HDTV--which I would easily and wholeheartedly give 5 stars--for the past two years but it was only a 32\" unit and Sony didn't have a 3D HD 40\" TV.  After 32\", their next size was slightly bigger than 40\" and it wouldn't fit in the entertainment unit.Second, the reviews on Amazon for this Samsung TV were virtually all fantastic.  So I bought it.  Well, the quality is okay but it can't hold a candle to my Sony 32\" TV.  Sure, it's bigger than my Sony and that's nice but the quality of the picture simply isn't as good.  Furthermore, the remote on this TV--and the promotional 3D blu-ray player--are beyond atrocious.  They are virtually unusable.  The engineers/designers at Samsung apparently have a different kind of hand than any human being in my family.  They make using the Samsung TV (and blu-ray player) an unpleasant experience.  Finally, the internet and other \"smart\" features of the TV are not as easy to use and well designed as Sony's and also cannot integrate well with my high end Yamaha RX-A1010 receiver like my Sony does so I have to use too many unusable remotes and click too many buttons (that you can't see in dim light or figure out where they are) to do simple operations.Oh, and there is one more thing which finally prompted my very first comment on a product I purchased on Amazon.com (and I buy EVERYTHING  on Amazon.com and have for over a decade) is that my TV began dying a little over a week ago and now it's dead.  It very quickly goes off and on, off and on, off and on, over and over again when you turn the TV on.  I've had this TV for less than 6 months and it's already broken.  I'm not happy.  Why oh why did I inherit an old (but great looking) entertainment unit whose maximum TV size was 40\"?", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "good tv", "Author": "RPG \"RPG\"", "ReviewID": "R3RMIJW8PMZGSZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordering from Amazon was a pain, but it may not have been Amazon's fault. I think it was the UPS driver's decision not to leave the package at the door, but rather to require a signature. I've received flatscreen TVs before where they just left it, so I didn't expect this. Apparently Amazon needed to specifically waive the signature requirement.Setup was a breeze. The \"chicken legs\" are a bit ugly but the rest of the TV is nice-looking except  somewhat thicker than I expected. The TV is quite well calibrated out of the box if you choose Movie mode, and adjust the backlight according to your preference. (All the modes other than movie are grossly exaggerated and cartoonish.)The TV will control your cable box through an IR emitter, but I prefer to control both the TV and the cable box (and other stuff) through a universal remote. The touchpad remote is surprisingly easy to use, but it's not a universal remote, so it has gone into a drawer. However, I ordered and received a Samsung IR remote through eBay so that I could have my universal remote 'learn' Samsung remote commands from it. That's because the supplied remote is a Bluetooth remote. Playing video files from a USB hard disk works well although it sometimes has trouble with the sound format.Going from a smaller TV, this TV looks huge for 2D, but as soon as I switch to 3D it feels small. That's probably because I'm subconsciously comparing it to theaters. I don't like 3D on this TV, it feels strangely diorama-like. The glasses don't feel uniformly bright.

The SMART hub doesn't output audio in 5.1 surround sound. This is absolutely ridiculous -- my primary motivator for buying this TV was the picture and having Netflix, Amazon Prime and Pandora baked right in. The audio from the SMART apps is HORRIBLE! This is a known issue with these TVs and it doesn't look like there's an update in sight. This thread can describe it better than I can: [...]. Do read this before considering your purchase, the audio from the SMART apps is almost inaudible to the point where I can't even use these apps to listen to audio or video. The sound is too garbled.About the picture:When I first set it up I had to spend hours looking up the optimal settings to get rid of the soap opera effect. When adjusting the picture settings you get this ridiculous grey overlay which covers the picture as you adjust the settings so you can't even see the changes you're making. You literally have to exit the settings to see your change then navigate back into the setting you're trying to perfect. For a TV with dozens of picture settings you can see how this would be tedious.The picture is decent once you magically find the perfect settings. Not close to what I was expecting though.At the end of the day you could probably spend $400 less than the cost of this for a model that'll give you the same picture with less hassle.
