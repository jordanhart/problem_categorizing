Two 50's and now this 58.  I had been so happy with the 50\" panasonics.  Great color, smooth motion, and excellent clarity.  I then wanted to move up to a 58\".  I should have listened to my instincts and stick with panasonic, but instead I bought a Samsung 58\" on a killer sale thinking I would be happy with it.  WRONG!  It emitted the most annoying buzzing noise ever and the color (even after calibration) was just average.

It doesn't get hot, it just heats up my apartment pretty fast. There again what do you expect from such a big screen?

From AV Science Forum to Amazon and Google.Ultimately Price won, and I bought this Set on Sears' BF sale, for a little under $1,100.00. All I can tell you is, if you're in the $1k+ change, price range, you CANNOT go wrong with this Set.-PRO-Remarkable Image QualityNoise Free HD displaySeveral tweakable picture presetsViera-Tools image Slide-Show\"Game\" mode. (excellent with X360 and PS3)Flicker-free 1080p, period-CON-none at this point, for the price, there is ZERO flaw with this set.The set is easily 75lbs without the stand, so if you are going to wall hang it, get a friend to help. However, I was able to lift it onto the wall mount, by myself. (5-10, 180lbs.)I run only HDMI input, out to my receiver. My receiver and DTV box detected the set over HDMI, and set resolution to 1080p. (note: some SD and other low-res HD sources can be displayed natively, and then stretched, squashed, or letterboxed to your liking with one of several display settings on the set.)For instance,FullJustifiedZoomHorizontal-Fill (H-stretch)That way, you don't have to deal with the annoying bars on the side for 4:3 content. It may appear grainier the closer you sit, because it's an SD image \"stretched\" to fill. But from 10' away, it looks good to me for SD.That's my last point, I have a small living room, and previously had a 42\" Plasma Toshiba in my room. Now that I have the 58\" I realize how undersized a 42\" is for a 10' - 12' viewing distance.Have someone hold a tape measure against the wall location you wanna mount this to, and drag the tape to where your head/eyes would be to get a close measure of viewing distance.I recommend you be at least 8-9' minimum before going with this size set.

I knew I was upgrading this year from a 55\" LCD 720 set that I bought in 06. Picture was great on the LCD but I went through 3 lamps and the limited viewing angle was a con because I have a big family and big sectional sofa. Not all seats provided the best picture quality. My family room is big and doesn't have a lot of direct sun so I knew plasma glare wouldn't be an issue. I looked at Panasonics, LG's, and Samsungs in this size range for months and the Panny was the best picture and value in this size range. 3D is cool but I'm totally willing to wait a few years before making that jump. I'll probably be able to pick up a 58\" 3D plasma for the same price I paid for the S2 in just a short couple of years.My family absolutely loves this set. Stunning picture and vibrant colors. HD NFL games are just plain awesome and blue ray movies are off the charts. The unlimited viewing angle and deep blacks just cannot be duplicated by any LCD or LED set. Weak speakers are no reason to criticize this TV. Anyone who buys a 58\" 1080p set and doesn't have at least a 5.1 surround system is missing the point of why you buy something like this. Heck, you can get a decent 5.1 HTIB for just 300 bucks nowadays.Most of my seating is 9-10 feet from the TV and the distance is perfect. Don't buy a 58\" TV if most of your seating is 8 feet or less.SD is always going to look muddy on a 1080p set so don't get hung up on reviews that criticize SD picture quality. Any high quality 1080p TV will never look good with a SD signal.The TV is heavy but what would you expect from a 58\" screen and a glass panel? I have an old Mitsubishi 35\" crtv console that weighs twice as much as the Panny. Once you mount it on the wall, who cares how much it weighs? It's all about picture quality and value. Weight is not a determining factor when buying a TV unless you plan on bringing it on vacation with you during the summer.I paid a pro for calibration after 200 hours of break-in and it was worth every penny. Picture is absolutely perfect and I don't need to do any more tweaking. For overall value, plasma tv's have a lock on screen sizes over 55\" and I could not be more satisfied with my decision on buying the Panasonic 58\" S2.

The Wii was not choppy/blocky but was slightly diffused instead.One beauty of it all was not needing to worry about configuring my bluray home theatre with a separate remote, as I set the Viera settings on, along with the audio output to home theatre.. poof, instant integration... and my blueray is a SONY... now I power on, and the tv and home theatre turns on straight to \"tv\" mode.

Delivery on time, A+.Dollar/performance this is the one to beat!It replaces a 50\" plasma Panasonic 720P year 2007.This TV operates in a dedicated HT room typically quite dark.I wanted to make a serios upgrade in size and move to a 58\" thus with regret I left out the Panasonic 54G25 that otherwise has an amazing picture quality, far better than the 58S2 but unfortunately Panasonic doesn't make the G20/25 series over 54\".Being my budget max $1500 I couldn't buy the 58\" plasma TV I really wanted, which I think is outstanding and far superior to anything else below $2,000, the Samsung 58\" series 7000. I do not care about 3D capabilities but simply about immage quality and still even if this plasma Samsumg had only 2D capabilities it would be a killer anyway. The Panasonic G25 and the Samsung 7000 are indeed very similar when displaying regular 2D immages.I visited multiple times all the major retailers in Vegas, open to any brand alternative to Panasonic in the +58\" category and up to $1500.  As a general consideration it's very hard to make accurate comparisons between different models due to different light conditions /settings/and material displayed, still playing with their remotes/settings I kind of got some more precise ideas on the actual performaces of the TVs in consideration.I checked Samsung models C500/C550/C680 that I couldn't find having a superior picture quality compared to the Panasonic 58S2. Certainly they have a better style they are lighter and have many more picture controls but also an immage and colors that in default setting was less correct and accurate than the Panasonic. In particular on the Samsung the white where always slightly on the red/pink side even with color set on standard.In total honesty the only that showed a slightly better image to the Panasonic 58S2 was the newer Samsung 58C680 but I couldn't justify the difference in price at the limit of my budget.I also checked a couple of 60\" by LG but a part from the fact that more than one unit had a clearly defective plasma panel which made me scratch my head about their actual relaiability, I found the  LG having always an  inferior picture quality to the Panasonic 58S2. The ton of settings available and THX certif appear to be quite irrelevant in this scenario. Cnet has a different opinion at this regard but hey I'm the buyer not them....Afterall I went for the Panasonic 58S2 that if one hand is apparently a more basic TV with less tweak capabilities on the other showed to have better immage foundamentals with  realistic colors and a more accurate and natural immage.I found on internet some reccomandations about the immage setting which I partially disagree with.It's true that \"Cinema\" is surprisingly the best overall setting and that Blacks need to stay on Light as otherwise on Dark they will crash no matter other picture settings BUT the color temperature on Warm is definetely wrong as whites become beige... Standard is more accurate even if very slightly on the (cold) bluish side. Any other adjustment is about personal taste bases on light intensity HDMI cable quality and source.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV But Lacks Audio Outputs", "Author": "Midwest Guy", "ReviewID": "R1T3L7XHGYRYTJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I usually would buy a product like this on Amazon, but in this case I found a Black-Friday deal at a local establishment that was too good to pass up.The picture quality is very good, for the price.  There are TV's with better picture quality but expect to pay at least 50 percent more for the premium.  Overall though I am very happy with the quality of the picture and it is better than most TV's from even just a few years ago.I was surprised to find though that the ONLY way to output audio is by using an optical cable.  There are no old-fashion RCA audio outputs.  Additionally there is no way to remix that audio to two channel sound.  It only outputs in 5.1 or 7.1 which means with my two speaker stereo, I am not getting the full sound and missing people speaking because I don't have a center channel speaker at this time.  There are ways around this.  I can take the sound coming off the cable box instead, and for me, I plan on upgrading to a 5.1 system soon so it is not a big deal.  But for some people, you may be forced to use the speakers built in to the TV if your equipment can't handle an optical cable, or surround sound.I could be wrong on this and if someone knows I'm wrong, please comment.  But I've read the poorly written manual through a couple of times and see no solution to this other than the cable box or having a proper surround sound system.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "New to plasma -- love it", "Author": "Jack M.

If your use to a flat ( no shine screen, it takes a little getting use too. Its full 1080P . I have Directv and who knows when they will start sending a 1080P signal. Someone told me that most transmission is 720P so it will give you a better picture if you stepping up from a 1080I. The Directv box will let you put a dot in the 1080P box on HD settings so I'm sure it's on the way. If your looking for 3D this is not the TV for you. I could care less about 3D, I just hope all the standard def. will upgrade soon. I have tweaked and tweaked and tweaked so before paying some one a lot of money to set it up try the following. Write down the settings you already have in case your not satisfied. I find that I get a stunning picture both with a crystal clear sat signal which you won't get 100% of the time but most of the time and I also use the same settings with Blu-ray and the picture is spectacular for me anyway.

I noticed after setting , it took a little while and the picture seems to be getting better and better. Again I am using the same settings for Blu-ray and the picture is beautiful. Transmission signals will vary with sat and cable too I'm sure. Hope this is a little help. Video noise reduction could be on or off I guess. I'm setting up a 7.1 Audio system and I'm sure most people are using surround sound these days. And for TV sound , it's o.k. for watching the news. Other than that the sound quality is fair and requires a lot of volume.A little more info as of 5/14/11. I found that watching a 720P format with Directv receiver is fine with HD and if you have your receiver set to 1080P it will receive the 1080P signal on some of the pay per view's. But if you set your receiver to 1080I , the HD picture remains as clear but it really cleans up SD. On 720P the SD channels are muddy so I find the 1080I seems to be the over all best setting for the time being. The beauty off this TV is that it will pick up what ever signal is sent. I'm looking forward to hooking up my TX-N 708 Onkyo which is supposed to upscale every thing to 1080P. This will probably be beneficial for the sat. signal and non blu-ray disc's. I read a forum from C.E.T. , when they compared 720P to 1080P they claim the picture looked the same. I did notice when I was watching the 1080P pay per view , the  picture did appear to have blu-ray quality.Update as of 5/22/2011 ----- The picture is getting better and better.

This occurred during scenes with a lot of white, or light color -- for instance, it was very bad when the main menu of my LG BD570 BluRay player was onscreen.  I know plasmas buzz (my old one did), and there is quite a bit of discussion of this on the web.  But the buzz I heard was far worse than I expected.  It was truthfully starting to drive me nuts as my 30-day return window was closing.  In fact I had decided to return the set and was going to set up the return any day.Fortunately I had found a discussion advising to check the power source -- ie, where you have the set plugged in (try removing power strips, try alternate plugs, temporarily unplug other equipment, etc).  When I changed where I plugged the set in the buzz disappeared, completely (and when I moved the plug back, the buzz returned).  Turns out I had an inline filter in front of the power strip the TV had been using.  I don't think this power filter was rated at sufficient current for the TV.  The power filter was unnecessary, and I discarded it.  Problem solved.Now there is ZERO buzz.  Difference is night and day.  I am annoyed with myself, because I waited a week or two after reading the online discussion of this before examining my setup.  I thought I knew better, and \"that couldn't be my problem.\"A final thought -- the TV has a number of preset viewing picture \"settings\" (game, custom, standard, cinema, etc) that are remembered per input.  I wish there were more, or more variability in the picture setup.  Thankfully I have found \"cinema\" works well for me in all cases.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "MCS", "ReviewID": "R2NGECL0TETB6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is nothing wrong with this TV, sound, picture, set-up, all great.

Main reason to purchase was the price offered by Amazon with free shipping. This HDTV replaced a 65\" Mitsubishi DLP unit that was only 4 years old. The Mitsu was a disappointment so I was leary about buying a new HDTV and spending BIG bucks on it.Researched many LCD, LED and Plasma models for weeks. Narrowed it down to a few models but I couldn't pull the trigger. I had noticed that Black Friday prices had gone up in early December. So when the price on the TC-P58S2 went back down to $1099 I jumped on it.I was concerned that the 58\" might be too small compared to the old 65\" since my viewing distance is 15 feet. I was also concerned about shipping/handling when I learned that the TV was coming from Arizona and I live in Ohio! It went through 3 transfer points and two different carriers to get to my house.Got the TV and the packaging showed no signs of damage. Great job for free! Hooked it up and the picture is amazing! Size is just fine. I couldn't be happier. Went out on New Year's Eve and picked up a Blu-Ray player. Sweet!I've spared you technical details and focused on the common concerns of purchase once you have decided to buy from Amazon. Price can't be beat. No tax for most of us. Free shipping even across the country with no problems. The eyes don't lie.

I also like the 58\" screen much better than our 50\" one -- everything is more detailed which, when connected to a good audio system -- creates a truly immersive experience. The sound quality with the Panasonic isn't important because I connected a  ZVOX 575HSD system. ZVOX 575HSD IncediBase Low-Profile High-Performance Single-Cabinet Surround Sound SystemIt is a real pleasure to have a great picture, great sound and an uncluttered space. The 575HSD brings well recorded movie scenes to life creating an extremely compelling audio experience, which, in turn -- serves to make the visual experience even better.The system setup is very uncomplicated and minimal. The only devices are the ZVOX 575, a Panasonic TC-P58S2 58\" plasma, a Samsung BD-P3600 blu-ray player and a Dish Network VIP-211 satellite receiver. There is only one toslink optical digital audio cable to connect the ZVOX to the HDTV. I purchased a Logitech 650 to control all devices.This HDTV replaced a 5 year old 50\" Pioneer PDP-5050HD that cost $5195.  The Panasonic is an order of magnitude better than the Pioneer.  I am impressed with how much plasma technology has improved as well as how much prices have dropped.  I don't expect to have the same problems with burn-in as I did with the Pioneer.Prices paid (all from Amazon): ZVOX 575HSD - $443; Panasonic TC-P58S2 - $1099; Logitech 630 - $74.99.The black Friday deals didn't last long because the prices went back up: the ZVOX 575HSD is now $599 and the Panasonic $1269, but even at those prices it is probably worth it.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "10 red blinks got me too", "Author": "Dwayne Hicks - 28,013  Xbot kills in Gears of...", "ReviewID": "R3PO2W06BOQV6I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After reading a lot of these reviews I see a common thread people who have had the TV for 2 weeks to a month are very happy as I was.Anybody posting a review after a year and a half is posting about the TV breaking, which is exactly what happened to me.

It is not the TVs fault, it is how they film Blu-Ray.Video games on the otherhand look awesome.  They don't have the film grain and are very smooth looking.DVDs though...very disappointing to me at first.  They have horrible amounts of film grain and look especially bad during dark scenes...at least at a viewing distance of 9-10 ft.  If you are probably 12 ft or further, you won't really be able to tell so much.  In the end though, I got used to the bad quality of the DVDs.For the color, you'll have to make some adjustments to get it how you like it.

It passes Dolby 5.1 to my Denon receiver as it should.I specifically wanted a plasma as I feel it is still a superior technology when compared to LCD and LED.  Some LED sets are very comparable in performance, but still fall just short and are far more expensive.I spent a great deal of time researching television and decided after all the leg work that this Panasonic set was the best option for me.  I also have a Samsung 42\" plasma and it does hum.  But I never noticed it before I read so many complaints about the Sammy's buzzing.  It is only audible from right up next to the television when on the right hand side.  That made me concerned that a larger model might buzz louder.  Though all of my in store research resulted in my hearing no buzzing from any sets in stores.The LG models are considerably less efficient.  Usually this isn't really a big concern for me, but I didn't want to have to get a new APC Smart UPS.  Their 60\" models use so much power they likely would have put me over the top.Panasonic has ruled the plasma market in the past and they do not disappoint with this model.  The picture quality is great.  I did break the television in with colored slides using the SD card slot.  Worked perfectly.  I never broke in or properly calibrated my Samsung mentioned above, but has since calibrated it.  I never had any problems with the Samsung and am still very happy with it.  That said, I wanted to be sure to take every precautionary step I could to ensure a good experience with the television.  It is used for general television viewing, Blu-ray movie viewing, and gaming.  I am thoroughly happy with this television.  It does lack some of the more 'expert' setting, but suits my needs perfectly.  I'm not a 'videophile' but require quality.  This set is perfect for me.The delivery was a little different than what most of us have gotten used to.  Shipping was handled by Pilot and went well, but the scheduled appointment was not kept and they delivered it a day later.  I was proactive in handling the delivery and contacted the local Pilot office to confirm the shipment's status.  They don't quite track packages the same way Fedex and UPS do.  They had to confirm the package's whereabouts, but once they did worked with me regarding the delivery.  I was very polite and disarming as they initially seemed as though they weren't willing to help.  Once they realized I wasn't being rude and demanding, they were very accommodating.  Just my experience.At $1099 with free Prime Shipping, Amazon seriously set me up with this deal.  Very happy.  Thank you Panasonic, Amazon, & Pilot!I hung the television on the wall with the following mount.  SANUS SYSTEMS VLT15-B1 37-Inchto65-Inch VisionMount Super-Slim Tilt Flat Panel Mount  It is a quality product, but the tilt feature doesn't really work as advertised.  Maybe the set is too heavy for it to work right.  I don't know.  I'm lucky in that the tilt angle it is at is where I want it, because I won't stay anywhere else.  No matter what adjustments I make to the mount, it is always at the same tilt angle.  Somewhere in the middle of flat and all the way forward.  This mount is not as sound and the Sanus one I had used for the 42\", but it wasn't a thin profile mount and was used with a smaller set.  If I 'jiggle' the television, it does move more than I'd like, but it is a solid mount.  ( I used the bolts from the previous mount as they were heavier duty than those included with this mount.)

I have been looking at getting this TV for a year. When I got it home it looked a little grainy, and not the best picture straight out of the box. However, since I have calibrated it (using the THX calibration from the CARS Dvd) it is much better. Also now that I have about 100 hours on it, it is getting clearer, and better looking every day. You have to realize when you buy a plasma TV that they take 150-200 hours to break in. We have watched several blu-rays (LG Blu Ray Player) and it looks amazing. Keep in mind that when you go to the big box stores, and see the TV on the wall, it will seem 1.5 times bigger in your house. I barely could get it into my basement because of height restrictions in the staircase. Set up was real easy, just some color, sharpness, and brightness adjustments, and I was done. I will check these adjustments again in a month or so when it has had a chance to fully break in. I would recommend it to anyone. I sit about 10-12 feet back from the TV and it is the perfect home theatre size. Too much bigger, and you would feel like you are sitting on the front row at the movie theatre.

No problems whatsoever with the Pilot Delivery (Professional and on time delivery during scheduled window & day). Followed AVS forums suggested break-in and calibration suggestions for 2010 Panasonic S2's and the resulting picture is Gorgeous (Especially compared to the 6 year DLP that it replaced)! The screen shows more reflections than our old DLP but is not that noticeable during the day and non-existent at night (Large Sliding Door window directly across from the screen). Part of the reason for the excellent pricing on the TC-P58S2 is due to its lack of internet connectivity & 3D compared to the next level offerings from Panasonic & others. But the internet connectivity can be overcome (if you are looking for that feature) with the purchase of an internet capable Blu-ray player (which also had significant discounts during the holidays and should be discounted again after CES 2011). If you are not interested in 3D, you can have a beautiful 58 inch plasma display and internet capability with an additional internet capable Blu-ray player for roughly 40% less than the next level 58\" plasma display from Panasonic.

LED, LCD, DLP and think I got probably one of the best TV on the market for the price. Quite simply. Plasma has got it. More so than the LED's TV. LED TB are fantastic and have that sexy slim look everyone seem to want today. But for me the pure picture quality of the Plasma had me. The black in this TV is simply amazing. And the colors are extrodinary. Sure! It's not as thin as the LEDs or some of the other Plasma offered by Samsung and LG. But that did not matter to me. Brightness, picture quality and price were the three main factors in my final decision making. This is my third Panasonic Plasma. So I already had a pretty good idea what I was going to get. The others are 720P though. But Panasonice really do make the best Plasma on the market in my opinion. The Samgsungs are very close and offer more widget and other network capable stuff that this \"S\" Series from Panasonic. I am very, very satisfied with this TV. I would have like to have a 3D VT model. But the price was out of my range. Maybe next time. Also the VT series was not available in the size I wanted. 58\" Inches. This TV connected to my Panasonic BD player deliver the most beautiful picture I have ever seen. I am simply awestruck when I watch Avatar on it. Wish it had four instead of three HDMI though. And offer more network option. But I am very satisfied and happy with this purchase. No regrets.

Standard also suffered from severe pumping and instability, so it was unusable in my opinion. Custom had it's own share of problems, which included less severe but still noticeable pumping, white crush, extremely poor gamma, and overly hot color. I tried several experiments and advanced adjustments while in custom mode; unfortunately, nothing could alleviate the poor gamma. Cinema mode brought relief; the image was rock solid, smooth, and bright. Cinema was the best (correction- the only) choice for an accurate picture.\"\"The S2 is much more Everyman's TV; it's pleasant, looks very good, and never fails to impress your friends and family, but it's not quite being truly faithful to the image. If you are not a super picky videophile, the S2 may well be your dream come true.
