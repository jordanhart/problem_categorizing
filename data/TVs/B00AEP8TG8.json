{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible value. Though at what price.", "Author": "M. Tremper", "ReviewID": "R2G7IVMWHIBJHE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just ordered this because of the obscenely low price ($278) compared to other TV's in this class. Like others I was very skeptical considering it was so cheap and from a brand I or anyone else had ever heard of. I considered if I didn't like it I can just return it, the price makes that risk worth it. The actual quality of TV blew me away. Before configuration the picture looks comparable to $800 screens of different brands. Blacks are black and colors are vivid. The system menu is very easy to use and attractive. The build quality is a little cheap but you get what you paid for. I've not noticed any dead pixels. Like other reviews have said the speakers are pretty crummy. I'd recommend getting a sound bar or a receiver to pipe audio out of instead. The reason it gets 3 stars instead of 5 is because it didn't come with a remote, joint to fasten the stand to the monitor, or any of the manuals or warranty information. The only things in the box were the monitor, stand, and power cable. I'm assuming this is an error on packaging's part and have written to customer support. Depending on how they get back to me may consider how I change my rating for better or worse. Till then I've got it built up on some books and controlling it with a universal remote after finding the manual on their website. I highly recommend this TV for someone looking for a basic LED HDTV without the smart tv bells and whistles and price. If future buyers also find parts missing out of the box you may want to steer clear unless you plan to wall mount it and use a different remote in which case you probably don't care.TL;DR: It's a great TV worth more than what they're asking. Audio is nothing to get excited for so you may want a soundbar. I had an issue with not enough parts included but everything is fine now. If you're looking for a cheap, large, non-smart TV, this is the TV for you.Update: Customer service was a breeze and the missing parts have been replacedUpdate 2: First was an early Christmas gift for mom. I was so impressed I ordered a second for myself since the price went to $250. This time it came with all the parts and documentation :).

Just basic, simple, and easy to use.I've only been watching the TV for a few minutes but the picture seems to be great. Haven't listened to the TV speakers as I use Headphones. Blacks seem to be black and the picture is clear. I've only seen some  720p videos on it so far (Direct TV) and I like the picture a lot.Things and light are reflecting off the screen so it's best to keep light away from the screen. It's best to watch this TV in the dark but it is fine in the light as well. For the price I got this for ($278) I can't complain at all.You can move the TV sideways without having to move the stand. You can't put the TV at an angle though up or down which is a bummer. Still though, my past few TVs with stands couldn't do anything but sit still and do nothing. So the TV being allowed to move at all is a plus.UPDATE:I finally got a blu-ray player even though I have had this TV for a little while.I did the best I could calibrating this as I am not very good at these things.Screen Size: Full 100% (does no cropping of the picture at all)Color Temp: WarmAvanced Picture Settings: All settings Off.Brightness: 51Contrast: 54Color:43Tint: 0Sharpness: 20I did these settings the best I can using the Spears and Munsil calibration Blu-Ray disc.Also, the remote feels really cheap.

Ibarra \"Steel hedgehog\"", "ReviewID": "R2BHSWZJORBEVI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It's okay. First and foremost, it's okay. Do not let this deter you from getting this TV. For the price you pay, it's a lot of value and should be treated as such. 90% of the people 90% of the time will look favorably on this TV, not because of how amazing it is, but for how amazing it is for the money you paid. Don't deny it, the reason you're reading these reviews is because you know there MUST be something wrong with this TV for it to be so big and relatively cheap, but you want to know if these yet known flaws outweigh your desire for a big cheap TV or keep you from enjoying it later down the road as your use of it evolves.It's a great TV. Not just for the money, but in general, it is a great TV for the sake of TV. Assuming of course all your delivered content is at 24 frames per second. You can stop reading and buy it now.You want to know more about what is so good about it? Fine, I'll divulge a bit.It has tons of connections. More than I honestly need and will use. It even has VGA so you can use a older PC with it. I'm using Radeon graphics (HD 7870) and have this television hooked up through the HDMI and didn't have to do much at all to get the picture correct and clear, so the connections work well. I've had other (older) LCD TVs require me to dig deep into their settings before I could get them to recognize and display the PC output correctly. I'm not sure how most newer TVs handle that, but this one does it automatically and great. Just be sure to set the Picture setting to \"Full 100%\" display mode and the picture will fill the screen properly.The stand works properly and allows the TV to pivot so you can get behind it to connect more things. I love that. The power cord is adequately long. Unlike a few reviewers, all of my HDMI ports work. Most people should check all the ports and features of any electronic, name brand or otherwise, to be sure there is no defects. And lucky me, mine is dandy.It's thin and light, it doesn't use a huge amount of power, in fact, before you mess with the picture settings, it starts out with Power Savings mode. Cranking up the brightness will turn up the power usage, but not be a huge amount, in fact I measure it to be only a few extra watts on static images. The sound works well for what it is, it's no home theatre system, but if you're buying a sub-$500 TV, you probably don't care about amazing sound. It's okay, and there is nothing wrong with that. I personally turned the treble up a bit to make voices more distinct and clear.So it's nice. You can buy it now, it's okay, you know you want it.Still here? You want to know why this review isn't 5 out of 5?  Didn't you see everyone else review this thing's amazing display and adequate sound? Fine, I'll tell you my problems with this television, but they won't apply to a lot of you out there so they're not exactly realistic reasons to keep most of you for enjoying this great bargain product.It's the display. I see it in several other reviews. This TV has a GREAT display. They can't believe how good it is, especially for the money. It's got great clarity! It's nice! The colors are so vivid!Sure. Until you hook it up as a PC display. Then you open up a website. Let's say amazon.com. Then you scroll down. Then you see it. THE GHOSTING (dun dun dun?)Ghosting is basically after images from poor response times from the screen or from bad analog signals. Basically, the pixels don't change color fast enough from one color to another and you see a sort of afterimage. This display has TONS of it. Almost all of it from white to another color. It's most noticeable when are scrolling down webpages with black text and multicolored images on white backgrounds. It's not just black, it's reds, pinks, oranges, and browns that leave these trails too. All easily noticeable from 15ft away. Maybe more, but I don't have the space to test it.Blues, greens and yellows are less noticeable, you have to be within 5ft of the screen to notice them and really look for it.Also, skinny black text on a white background seems to have faint yellow highlights, which bugs my eyes quite a lot. I even brought other people in and asked them, \"Do you see some of this faint yellow around some of these letters, or am I just crazy?\" I got a resounding yes from my volunteers (to seeing the yellow, not to my being crazy). This doesn't happen with thicker, larger or bold text.Most videos on the internet run lower than 30fps to save bandwidth, so Netflix and Hulu are going to display just fine on this TV. I mean, the ghosting is still there, it's just less apparent. I only noticed it when watching vlogs with people with dark rimmed glasses and pasty white faces moved their heads a lot. I doubt you're going to care about a little text and picture trails if you're checking facebook or trolling some forums, this isn't a deal breaker for lot of people. But not me, I like to game on my PC and use Steam's Big Picture Mode. Anything running faster than 24 fps with lots of contrasting color is going to have ghosting and you WILL notice it. An extreme case of this would be Guacamelee. I love that game. It is lots of solid colors and little shading or light effects. There are many portions of the game where your main character will be running quickly against a light background where the ghosting will be VERY apparent. Military shooters with bright skies and lots of cinematic lens flare have tons of ghosting too and motion blur will becomes mildly exaggerated.\"We get it, you play games, it's not perfect, so what?\" It's not only games that I see this being a problem. Just shopping around Amazon.com, I notice products lose detail on this screen when you have two like colors next to each other. That black stitching on those black shoes that is usually obvious? Where the black leather and black breathable mesh meet? Gotta zoom right in on it to see it is even there, otherwise it's just detail-less single black space. The best way I've found to fix this is to turn off the Dynamic Contrast feature, but this leaves more vibrant scenes looking more bland. So depending on the media you're consuming, you're going to have to change the settings. Which brings us to my next complaint.The responsiveness from the TV's menu navigation and remote commands. I can press the buttons for the volume or navigation quickly, but the TV just doesn't respond to the commands quickly. You need the volume down fast, but not muted? Too bad. Holding down the button doesn't help either, it doesn't accelerate after a second or two, same snail pace all the way.  You know where everything is in the menu and want to adjust something quickly? Slowdown, Cowboy, you'll press the buttons faster than the TV will respond. So even if you did want to mess with settings between games for the best picture for a given event, it's going to take patience.I can't judge how a PS3 or Xbox will play on this TV, I don't own them. But from my experience, if you're a gamer with sharp eyes, don't grab this TV and expect to be competitive with ultra-fast response times and clear color contrast. I can only assume when you see that black chopper descending from the sky with that bright lens flare, you're going to see the same ghosting you would see from the PC version of the same game.Also, on bright scenes you will notice the backlighting isn't quite even, with some slight darkness on the left and right edges. I feel like a whiner for saying it, that hardly bugs me like any of the other mentioned problems, but I feel I should say it for completeness sake.See? Doesn't that all seem circumstantial and nit-picky? Think that'll apply to a lot of people? Most casual gamers, children, soccer moms or dads that just want to have a beer and watch the big game won't care about any of the issues I have. I doubt they'll even notice it. Most shows and cartoons have enough difference in color that the lack of contrast won't make you miss any important detail.I'm still trying to convince myself to keep the TV, this is the 2nd one I've had delivered to me. First one had a red stuck pixel, and none of the silly color changing backgrounds I threw at it fixed it. This one has some specks from foreign material getting trapped  inside of it during manufacturing and single stuck grey pixel off in the lower left corner of the screen. Please not that these things happen with ALL TVs regardless of the manufacturer or cost and DOES NOT EFFECT THE RATING OF THIS PRODUCT. All judgements of ghosting and contrast issues were made viewing this TV in both a lighted room and with the lights off.If anyone has any questions or criticisms, free to comment. I am open to answering questions and accept constructive complaints or comments.-EDIT- 12-7-13Another odd flaw has come to my attention. When viewing two different webpages side by side I noticed part of one of the page's design was replicated across the entire screen. To anyone with this TV and a computer, you can replicate this by going to TomsHardware.com and place the browser on the left or right side of the screen. The dotted lines between articles are spread across the entire screen and move as you scroll up and down the page. Once again, if you plan to use this TV as a monitor for a PC, I do not recommend it. I have made this a 2-star review now, the quality of the display is worse than I originally thought. I'm pretty sure I'll find more webpages or scenarios that will expose more flaws in this TV as time passes.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I got the last laugh.", "Author": "Laura", "ReviewID": "R8LXPJUN1ADVG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my son this television for Christmas.

Yes, a little caution had to be thrown in the wind as I'm sure a lot of off brand TVs have left people regretful but this is not one of them.Despite the reviews claiming poor sound and picture, I found it to be quite the opposite. The picture is great after a few tweaks in the settings and the sound is average to above average with a surprising amount of control if you know what your doing. I'm sure there are better TV's out there but this is extremely solid for the price and I'm much happier I didn't waste the extra money for a \"name brand\".Tested my gaming systems and Blu-Rays and was satisfied with the results too. Soon I will be displaying my Mac on it to see how that goes but I'm sure with the results so far that it will be satisfactory.Don't listen to people that would prefer you buying something more expensive because they bought something more expensive.

Part of my work requires a large monitor, which was the purpose of this purchase - to be able to do a little work from home on weekends without a big price-tag or getting in the way of the family's screen.My expectations were very low for this purchase, primarily because of the $249 price tag.  That's disruptively low for a 40-inch 1080P product.  Although I tend towards Sony and Samsung, I thought \"hey, it's Amazon...if it's not worth the rock-bottom price, just return it.\"At the moment this purchase is still pretty confusing.  Yes, I realize LCD substrate doesn't come from very many places and that other than some of the internals, most LCDs have a lot in common screen-wise.  But this device is over-the-top on features and is picture-wise several orders of light-year ahead of, for example, a Walmart Sanyo, anything made by Element, Westinghouse, pretty much anything by Vizio, and the rest of the low-cost alternative.  It's Korean, which means (although difficult to verify) that the screen probably comes from the joint Samsung/Sony factory.  The LED distribution is very, very even, without the splotching seen so often on low-cost displays.  It has MHL, a very modern capability.  I got a three-year warranty for $20.  Even if it dies after three years and 1 day, that's like $8.50 / month for a what is a pretty good set.  How are the manufacturers achieving this price?  Perhaps sometimes \"too good to be true\" means I'll have to be wrong today.

I was a bit hesitant to order an \"off brand\" tv, especially one that was just introduced this year, but knowing Amazon's great return policy I figured this purchase would be safe enough.  And, for all the conspiracy theorists out there, I do not work for oCOSMO or AMAZON, so this is a sure-nuff review!  The tv came in great condition in 3 days, and the box was intact.  The TV was packed well inside and floated amongst four high-density foam corner blocks, with about 3\" of open space on the face and back, so short of a fork lift impalement or crushing incident, this seems to be a very secure boxing type.  All the listed accessories were intact, and immediately I noticed the instruction book was printed on nice glossy paper with full color illustrations (classy!)and it was fairly easy to understand and very complete.  I had the tv set up and ready to go in under 5 minutes, including assembly of the swivel base (a small but functional screwdriver was included!).  The picture was VERY nice right out of the box, but of course I had to do some small amount of tweeking to the settings in the menu to get it \"just right\".  Seems to have plenty of color saturation, a very sharp display, and plenty of room left for adjusting the tint, color, contrast, etc.  The 1080i was especially sharp on my OTA (over-the-air) stations. Be advised, this set features an \"Energy Saving\" video setting as default from the factory, so if you want a brighter display turn off this setting first thing. The viewing angle is somewhat narrow, which is troubling.  The picture washes out when you move a few degree to either side of looking straight at it, and the tint and contract really change.  Now, I've heard better sound, as it's barely acceptable for us in the living room.  Our smaller Panasonic actually has far better sound, just fuller and richer, so this may be a problem unless you have a sound bar.  With the bass turned almost wide open on this model, even with TruSurround turned on, it was very mid-range heavy and sounded like it was coming from a tin can.  Fortunately, the menu also includes a nice graphic EQ that you can mess with, but all in all the sound is pathetic on this model. We may invest in a sound bar at some point down the road, but it will have to do for now. Please note: This set sadly does NOT include a \"Signal Meter\" function in the menu, which is very handy for OTA broadcasts.  It does, however, include a \"Guide\" button on the remote which displays the program information, title, content, etc. for the current program while using for OTA broadcasts.  The remote is well laid-out, logical, and even has a section for a ROKU stick if you want to watch streaming video, as this TV is \"Roku-ready\", which is nice. The remote is fairly weak, though, and you need to point it directly at the sensor.  Another negative that I will mention - - the tuner in this set is not as sensitive as my old Panasonic for some OTA stations - - a couple of them break up more often, although I have a steady 75% signal on those particular ones, with 100% on all the others.  The oCOSMO instruction manual states that your OTA signal should not fall below 65%, which is a bit odd as I had a few stations that never gave any problems on my Panasonic that were around 50%.  I have a very small RCA in the bedroom that does the same exact thing as this oCOSMO, while the Panasonic does not.  Just a little frustrating, and while not a deal breaker by any means, I had to deduct a star for this shortcoming.  Not a big deal if you don't watch a lot of OTA broadcasts. Obviously there is a bit of weakness in these sets in their power to draw in weaker OTA stations, as compared to the high-dollar TV's out there with more powerful and sensitive tuners.  Bottom line - - this set seems to be of a nice quality, not super fancy, but good for the $$$.  It's lightweight and runs fairly cool, which is good, too.  It's one of the best bargains in electronics that I've ever made, and that's saying a lot!  I come from a background in electronics, with my dad being from the old school of radio & TV repair, and I'm very familiar with all the many brands of electronics and their makers.  This particular TV has several \"interesting\" qualities - - it's remote codes are for SONY - - and it's menu display is the same as RCA.  My smaller RCA has an identical menu, so oCOSMO seems to be a major manufacturer of components used by other manufacturers who has decided to make their own brand of TV.  I also know that Sceptre is another brand that these folks make, their 39\" model  being almost identical to this one.  Nevertheless, the reliability of these sets is yet to be established, but there's nothing at this point to indicate that they won't be as reliable and long-lasting as the next brand from Asia.  Needless to say, I'm very impressed with oCOSMO and hope this TV lasts for a several years.  I did purchase the 3-year warranty, just in case.  In short, this TV is quite a BARGAIN and we like it. Well done, AMAZON!!UPDATE: After using this set for almost two months now, it seems to be holding up great. But, I am not as enthusiastic with the picture quality,  the limited angle of view is very troublesome, and the overall quality of the picture is a bit lacking, even after much adjustment of the settings in almost every conceivable combination. Additionally, I will stand by my initial critique of the sound quality of this TV - - it's just horrendous.  Obviously, most of the excessive mid-range and rattling of the speakers comes from the ultra-thin design, and is common among any TV of this design - - some are even worse, so it is what it is.  Another very obvious flaw in the sound that I didn't mention earlier - - when you turn it down to 1 it is still FAR too loud (roughly equal to the 7 setting on my Panasonic) which makes it tough to watch late at night when you don't want to disturb others.  I've found if I disable the TruSurround mode it will lower the sound, which helps, but still it's just too loud on it's lowest setting. In desperation, I connected the TV audio outputs to my AV receiver and it helped (of course), but still the quality of the sound is just much too thin and mid-range heavy (seems to be coming from the TV's own amp). Our old smaller Panasonic had superior sound and picture quality overall, and unfortunately I'm forced to take this new oCOSMO TV to the bedroom and bring our old Panasonic back to the living room.  The sound quality issues, along with the somewhat narrow viewing angle and lackluster picture just isn't going to allow it's continued use as our main TV.  However, you have to remember the price I paid for this thing, which is still remarkable for what we got.  I am now considering a new 40\" set with a more proven track record, such as a Samsung brand.  While the price is somewhat more, the difference in overall quality in picture and sound is not even close, and anyone who honestly can say they are the same is only fooling themselves. This oCOSMO TV is great for the price, a good bedroom or spare TV, but for a main set there are much better options out there - - in this case you get what you pay for, but not much else.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent product at a great price.", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "RWFPPCJJRO04L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Came in good working order.

My wife and I wanted a slightly larger TV for our bedroom than the one we had and started shopping for something that looked good but was affordable. If money was not an issue and I had some to burn than I probably would have gotten a different TV but we were looking at spending around $300 max. Ideally we wanted a 40-42\" for the space in our room. This is the only TV in that size that was in the price range we wanted to stay in. I was skeptical at first. It was a brand I had never heard of and with it being so cheap there had to be a catch. Upon arrival I opened it up and was immediately impressed with the physical appearance of the TV. It was light but did not feel lacking in quality by any means. The important part is the picture. I became even more impressed when I finally got it hooked up. I mounted it to the wall and have a Sony blu-ray player attached to it. The picture is great! The processor has handled every movie we watched great ( I watched Avatar on it for the initial trial run) and netflix looks awesome as well. For the videophiles in the world the screen is not going to be mind-blowing but it looks really good. The one thing I have noticed is when its an all black scene or fade out you can see where the black pixels are inconsistent in the depth of their color. This happens rarely and has never been an issue watching anything on it though. For the price you will NOT find a better TV. Some people are concerned with the name of the products they have in their house which is fine and understandable but in this case we definitely made the correct choice.

Its very thin, very light (about 10 lbs lighter than my 32 inch sharp, even though it was still a flat screen LCD), and had an ample selection of ports. The ones that i actually use and care about are very accessible, (3 HDMI, 1 USB, and Audio out) but the rest are kind of a pain to reach as they are under the backside of the tv.Pros:1080p 40 inch tv for only 250good picture quality relative to the price3 HDMI ports, which is kind of unheard of for something this cheapthin, light, and attractive bezelCons:sound quality is very poor, and frankly weird..picture takes a lot of adjusting before it meets expectationsOverall this is a great TV so far, especially at this pricepoint.

Picture is fantastic and my other TVs are an expensive Panasonic 50\" Plasma and a high end Samsung.  The picture is crisper. sharper than the Panasonic  and every bit is good as the Samsung if not better.  It came very well packaged  and was easy to setup.  The screwdriver that was included was a real commercial screwdriver it was still inadequate. As a monitor it works better than the Panasonic and as well as the Samsung with perfect alignment.  All three HDMI work fine.  Besides the three HDMI it also has component inputs, composite and co-ax cable input for digital TV or Cable without set top box.  It also has a SPDIF digital output  but not optical like the Samsung and Panasonic has.  This is a downer for me as the LG 1000 Watt home theater receiver I have has an optical input not an RCA type wired digital auto input but the sound is fine through the HDMI.  The FIOS set top box has an optical audio connection so I used that to connect to the receiver as well.  To its credit besides the VGA input it also has a mini-jack input for the PC sound.  What I like about the sound is its clarity.  The Panasonic TV has good definition excellent  bass and treble but it is hard to understand what the characters are saying, OCOSOMO has great clear midrange.  The HI-FI 5 point audio I am running from the FIOS DVR HDMI output into the receiver which also has an HDMI output into the TV.  There is also a headphone output on the TV.  Unlike the Panasonic Plasma the OCOSMO runs very cool as does the Samsung with a yearly estimated energy cost of $12.30 so you can't heat your room with it.  The remote is light and fully adequate and easy to use, the Verizon FIOS remote uses SONY setting 0027 for OCOSMO at least for the Motorola remote that has four device selector buttons.  Another feature I like about the OCOSMO is it is light and thin even more so than the Samsung and the on TV controls are easy to access being on the side.  Another nice input is the USB (which is used for displaying HD wholesome family pictures of course).  Most of the time I use this as a PC monitor which is flawless with auto adjustment right out of the box.  If there is a downside the manual could use some improvement as it does not identify which is HDMI one, two and three so you have to figure it out.  It would seem to me to be an easy thing to identify in the manual what are inputs and what are outputs.

Granted, I have only had it one day lol, but I absolutely LOVE IT!! My 4 year old Colby was dying and took 20 minutes to just turn on, so I needed to get a new tv, and also wanted a bigger tv since I got the PS4. I wanted nothing less than 1080p, and noticed it costs about $50 to $100 more than the 720, being on a less than $300 budget, it was difficult to find something with good reviews. I saw the oSOCMO 32 inch, which has well over 4 stars on 40 reviews, so figured the brand was good, although never heard of it before. I didn't like how Amazon decided to just ship this in the TV box, good thing I was home because people would have seen a big TV sitting on the porch! Package was banged up a little, but the inside of the box the TV was secure, so it all was good.The setup was really easy, except the whole base thing took me a bit to figure out how to screw it all down right, the thing even comes with a screwdriver lol. I plugged everything in, plugged PS3 and PS4 into the HDMIs with ease....it auto scanned for channels (took about 15 minutes). Turned on with a CRYSTAL clear picture, amazing quality.

Got this tv for Christmas when my husband and I switched bedrooms and became a lot farther from the 22 inch tv we had previously, making reading titles on Netflix rather tedious in bed. We also needed a tv for another room and it made sense to put the 22 inch in there. I'm very frugal however and was frustrated with the awesome deals on 32\" TVs but nothing larger. Comparing the 22\" and the 32\" it wasn't much of an upgrade but a 40\" for the price of a 32\" seemed impossible, especially wanting 1080p and LED. I found one on Walmart.com and have discovered through reading endless amounts of reviews that this is the exact same TV for a little bit cheaper (at least in December it was) but with a different brand name.We are SO pleased and while we aren't tech snobs, literally everything else we own tech wise is name brand, a Vizio Smart TV in the living room, Apple computers and phones, Sony Bluray players etc, so we aren't used to second rate glitchy off brands and I was fairly nervous given that fact. I will say I am writing this review right now because I realized I had totally forgotten it was an off brand tv. It is that good. We have watched it every single night (an episode or 3 of MASH or something on Netflix each evening) since Christmas with zero issues. We hooked up a Bluray player and have Netflix and YouTube which look great on it.I also purchased a super cheap Cheetah Flush Tilt Mount from Amazon for incredibly cheap and although it took a lot of assembly, it is a great mount provided you assemble it well...

I was a little skeptical of what kind of quality I'd be getting for such a low price from an unknown manufacturer, but I was pleasantly surprised.Upon arrival two months ago, the TV was pretty easy to set up.  The hardest part was the stand that took about 10 minutes.  I was impressed that all the accessories, manuals, and tools came individually wrapped in ziplock bags as opposed to the completely sealed plastic backs like I was expecting.  It even comes with it's own cleaning cloth.  The TV read all the channels from my digital antenna without missing a beat, and even picked up a couple that don't have any programming for some reason.So far, my only complaint is that the red/white audio jacks are shared for the component and composite video inputs.  So if you have two devices that you want to plug into the TV using those hookups, only one of them can have sound at a time.

First, it was a good review, then it was a bad review, and now it is a GREAT review. Don`t worry, I`m not bi-polar, let me explain.I bought this TV on Dec 1 (Sunday) and received it on Dec 3 (Monday) with FREE shipping option. The box was light weight and I was able to carry it upstairs and put it together myself. I`m a woman :) (This was my first good review) The box it came on made it look like I was going to have an amazing picture but I did not, at first. This is where my bad review came in. The picture was so dark and sometimes had static. My old box TV that I replaced did not. However, about 3 days later, I played Black Ops II on it and the picture was far more clear than my old box TV. The TV was not good quality still no matter how much I played with the settings. Well, one day I was playing with the settings and I came across the add/delete channel option. So I clicked it. Now, I have basic cable and an old box TV so I only had up to channel 79. So I started deleting channels 80 and up. Then I realized there were channels like, 112-1, 112-2, 112-27 and I was like what in the world? So I just kept on checking them for the delete/skip list. My husband came in and asked why I am deleting all the good channels? (He doesn`t watch TV when I am home because it is \"my\" TV, he has his own but enjoys mine. (It`s bigger) so when I am home, I`m the only one who watches the TV in the room. I was like how are these good channels I don`t even have these channels? Well, I know nothing about digital TV, I live in the simple days, lol. He showed me all of these channels, all of my favorite channels and they were crystal clear. I was like, ahh man this is amazing. So now I watch these weird channels like 212-65 and I love them. The picture, and best of all, old channels that I don`t have on basic cable such as Centric, GSN, OWN, Lifetime Movie Network. Yet, I`m still paying for BASIC cable while getting hundreds of channels. I do enjoy this TV. My initial bad review was because I`m not quite TV smart. Until now, I only watched about 6 channels. Now I watch over 30 different channels.

The colors really are very vibrant, which is great. The included swivel base, is amazing. It works easily and smoothly. it has 3 HDMI ports, 1 usb port, and the cord is 3 pronged. The remote is great, very light and thin, and not so small that you loose it constantly. It has all normal remote control functions, but it has roku controls and soundbar controls all in one remote. Really handy. The packaging was great, kept the tv protected well. The remote takes 2 AAA's the batteries are included. You also get a nice sized cleaning cloth, which is really just a nice touch to an already great tv.IN CONCLUSION: I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH THIS TV. COLORS ARE VIBRANT, SOUND IS GOOD (NOT TINNY) THE PRICE IS SO CHEAP, YOU CANT REALLY GO WRONG!", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "E.

I'm happy to report that I have no such lag when using the screen as a second monitor to my MBP, using Mini DisplayPort to HDMI. My assumption is that he didn't turn off things like dynamic contrast and noise reduction, which I always turn off by default, but could be just a faulty panel. Biggest issue now is with no-name sets like this it's hard to find good picture settings somewhere like AVSF.I have noticed on my cable channels that there is definitely some motion judder or pixelation in fast-movement areas.

The picture is absolutely fine.  I've seen plenty of TVs in the stores, and I can't see how the picture on this set is any worse.  For the price, you really cannot beat this product.  I pity the people that pay hundreds of dollars more for a same size television.I only have one complaint: the lack of audio outputs.  There is no optical or HDMI out.  The best you are going to do is the orange s/pdif (coax) cable.  I had to return a sound bar because it did not even accept a coax input.  So be aware if you are purchasing components.As for the Roku ready, I got a much better deal on a box compared to the usb stick - so this feature really wasn't worth it to me.  I suppose the one benefit of the usb stick is that you do not need a power outlet for it.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Undependable Purchase", "Author": "Marion Stanley", "ReviewID": "RVZCXKE3I6FEV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Great picture, however audio went out after 3 weeks just started clicking in the middle of a movie.

That being said I don't think the sound is as bad as the reviews led me to believe.  Bass could definitely be louder as always  associated with flat screens, but does emit audio at an acceptable decibel.

I snagged it during the cyber monday sales on it and it was only $250, but I would still shell out far more for this TV after using it for the past half year or so.The only thing you need to know before you buy this is if you plan on doing multiplayer split-screen gaming on this TV.  It is only 60Hz which means that say 4 person split-screen Call of Duty will lag considerably to the point where you won't want to use it. It works beautifully on single player games like Skyrim and even games like Borderlands 2 player split screen or 3 person split screen Little Big Planet Karting. It seems to become a problem with 4 player split screen games.Other than that it fantastic and highly recommend to all as long as you keep the above in mind. The colors are spectatular.

The aesthetics of the TV are very nice - the thin, matt-black bezel around the screen is a uniform thickness all the way around and looks so much better than many others with glossy and/or non-uniform thickness bezels in my opinion.  The picture quality from my Direct-TV high definition HDMI output is as good as almost TV on the market, and I suspect almost all consumers would agree if they saw the picture.  If anything is a little bit less than outstanding, it is the sound.  It's clear and loud enough, but it does lack in base and mid-range.  However, it is more than good enough for most folks I suspect, especially if it is not your main TV.  As others have done, I will eventually get around to adding a sound bar to beef up the audio.

I was very skeptical because of the very low price but the picture is crystal clear!  Sure there are better TVs out there but I can not justify paying hundreds more for specs that will barely make a difference.  There are a couple of reasons why I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars versus 5 out of 5.  The remote could be better.  I have a very large living room and the remote only works within 15-20 ft.  I rectified this problem by programming my cable remote and now i have full range.  Make sure to use SONY remote codes when programing universal remotes.  The other problem with the remote is that the source button only brings up the source list and does not toggle through the inputs.  Not a huge deal but it makes my cable remote useless for changing inputs.  Lastly the sound is not that great.  All treble no bass.  However I strongly recommend purchasing the oCosmos CB301524W 2.1 Sound Bar System with Built-In Subwoofer, Wi-Fi, and Android OS  (B00ABAWHIM currently only $49!  Cant believe the price and it also turns the TV into a smart tv with android apps!  Overall extremely pleased with this purchase and would recommend this TV to anyone.

Real Review!", "Author": "Angel", "ReviewID": "R1WTA0OOFTHUSF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm giving this 4 stars but I don't know if that will change over the time period or not. Well quick delivery and I was very fortunate to have bought this as one of the last ones in stock. I would like to point out some things that I thought were somewhat the \"cons\" of such a deal. In my opinion the sound is great of course you can tweak it to the \"best\" settings that suites your needs however getting a sound bar? Are you deaf? The sound is great unless you are listening from like 50 ft away or going deaf. But, in all honest I don't think I need a sound bar like some reviewers are saying. I think it's acceptable unless you want to boost it then go for it. Here is where it gets to the cons. I tested my X Box 360 on it hoping some reviews I read where wrong about the couple of seconds delay for the picture to catch up. That is true, unfortunately. As you are playing let's say Black Ops II Zombies and running through that fire in Town Survival the whole screen is a blur and very uncomfortable to play especially if you are the last one alive! The picture takes a while to catch up if you are in motion like running etc. I haven't had the time to actually mess around with it if it does that to all the picture settings. But be warned the past reviews on this are true. To SOME gamers this wont really be a big deal if you are playing from far but if you are playing up close it is so noticeable. I wear glasses and the blur is just intensified. But as to watching TV from lets say a couch in the living room then it's fine. But for a deal on an 40\" TV I can live with that. I will update more on my review as soon as I get all the tweaks out and get it to my gaming setup.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "not bad fot the price", "Author": "jermaine richards", "ReviewID": "RVCBC71QOOH1R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture quality is very good but sound quality is very poor.

While everyone says bigger is better, in my living room I think it's a great size (we sit about 6' away) as I'm not a fan of having a giant TV dominate the room. I suspect if you are a discerning customer this may not be the TV for you, but if that's the case you're probably not reading this review anyway. In my case, our main TV was a 32\" Vizio 720p LCD from about 2005. That was back when Vizio was a brand name no one ever heard of and was a cheap chinese no-name tv like this is today. And I had pretty good luck with it so why not try it again!TVs have come a long way since then. This new one is so much thinner and lighter (though perhaps being light weight is not a good sign). It looks much better, thin with a narrow bezel, and the swiveling base is a nice touch. The picture looks good to me as well, compared to the 720p 32\" it's much sharper and the added size helps. It does seem much cooler (color temperature) than my old TV but I haven't played with settings much and perhaps the old one was overly warm.The only negatives I've found so far are:1. The english in the manual is pretty bad. Not sure why they can't hire a native speaker to proofread these things.2. The audio out is only RCA or RCA-style digital. My receiver/blue-ray player only has a optical digital in, so I don't think I can hook up a digital output from the tv to the receiver. Not sure if that really matters though, sounds ok with just L/R RCA.3. The third HDMI port takes a few seconds to activate as it checks if whatever is plugged in is an MHL device.I sprung for the square trade 3 year warranty on here for $21 to hedge my bets a bit. At the price, as long as this tv lasts 5 years or so I think it's a fine buy.Update: One additional note, the USB port on the TV will power a chromcast which is a nice touch.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tv great price", "Author": "Megan", "ReviewID": "R36KCET18ODPZR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "TV is great!

The 1080p picture looks great, even at 60Hz. The sound isn't totally impressive, but let's be honest, almost every TV doesn't have great built in speakers. And since this TV has audio output for SPDIF, RCA, and Auxillary, you can easily get some awesome external speakers or a sound bar.The remote is also something I want to mention. The design of it is pretty mediocre, to be honest. However, it actually works great. It can even control a Roku receiver and soundbar (although it probably only supports oCosmo sound bars).Finally, the overall build quality of this TV is excellent. I just got a 32\" Samsung Smart TV which costed more than this and I personally think this brand is better. It doesn't have any frills; it does what you ask it to do very well, and at a low price.The only unknown with this TV is dependability over the long term.

I wasn't looking to purchase a TV, but I was in a market to step up my PC monitor size from 27\" to something bigger, if possible (still using my 27\" as a desktop extension on my windows). When I've seen the Black Friday / Cyber Monday $249 deal (was $278) for this TV, I had to try one. I placed an order without seeing any good reviews of how this TV would operate as a computer screen. 3 days later I had my TV delivered. First I opened the box and checked all the contents for missing parts, as at least one reviewer on here was missing some parts. Everything was in the box, so I went ahead to assemble it. Assembly was a breeze - I didn't even need the manual, they even provide you with a phillips screwdriver that you will need for assembly. Hooked it up to my computer & powered it on. I was instantly amazed by the picture of this TV, it more than met my expectations for the price. Full HD is awesome on this screen. Video quality is on par with most of the brand name manufacturers out there. Viewing angles are as good as any other, except for Samsung - from what I've seen. The sound is good, but not great, although at this price you're not going to have it all, because TV makers that put more into their TV's, know that \"bells & whistles\" are worth the higher price - so they are more than happy to charge us for 'em. This also works well as a PC screen as I've come to find out. Obviously with a bigger screen, the pixels will be more visible if you sit to close, but if you sit farther back or if your vision is not great this works VERY well. I'm glad I've made this purchase. Amazon did great as usual, quick & free shipping and all. I just hope that this oCosmo does as well as my 27\" I-Inc (another no name brand) LCD screen as far as reliability & dependability goes.

The build quality is good, I don't think making it any more durable would be of any extra benefit for a TV. It's sturdy on the stand and feels like it would stay standing through a quake or whatever might happen. The packaging was unexpectedly great with good bumpers in the corners of the box, a heavy duty screen protector, and the few little parts for the stand and remote in resealable plastic bags. The only thing I didn't like about how the screen arrived is that there were some stickers on the face of the screen itself that peeled off cleanly, but to get the corners up to get a grip I had to scratch uncomfortably hard on the screen with my nail. Had me a little worried that I might cause damage before I even plugged it in, but that turned out fine.The picture is good enough that I really can't say anything negative about it without having a second TV to compare it to. Blacks are deep black. The only bummer is that it really wasn't made for up close viewing and doesn't quite look right from closer than 5 feet or so. The viewing angle is too narrow or something so it darkens slightly at the corners when you're looking at the center of the screen from close up. It wouldn't be an issue except that I'm using the screen as a computer monitor half the time. Haven't tried using the in screen speakers.Bottom line after seeing this TV in person, it's awesome for the price. I wouldn't have paid $100 more if it had meant a name brand model, let alone $500 which is more like the actual price difference.Edit: Also, as another reviewer said, this screen does look a ton better if you adjust the picture settings to your taste.

If you try to use this as a monitor connected to a PC, you can really see how bad the picture is.Second, the sound works only intermittently.  This also seems to affect only some units (see other reviews).  Sometimes, in the middle of watching a program, the sound will stop working.  The only way to fix it is to turn the TV off and back on.  I initially thought again this was due to a defective HDMI cable, but it continued after swapping out the cable; it also happens with my Roku, which uses a different HDMI cable/input.
