I specifically did not want a smart TV because a lot of the research I found was that most of them are laggy and freeze up. I wanted to focus on getting a quality TV that was less than 32 inches, and use the dedicated 3rd party smart box, like the Roku 3. The Roku 3 which works great, has a lot of stuff, and has strong Wifi. I also plug my headphones into the remote on the Roku 3. I like how the TV has different brightness modes, along the line of stand, dynamic, and something else. I can't think of anything that I don't like about this TV.I would definitely buy this TV again and I probably will for the cabin.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not the bleeding edge...and that's good", "Author": "Joe Z", "ReviewID": "R2LND4Y6JZIX54", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just unpacked it, hooked it up to both my cable and an external antenna and it works great! The menu system isn't quite intuitive, but I've seen worse. Just press a few wrong buttons and you'll figure it out.I replaced my flip phone for a not-so-smart phone (Samsung Galaxy Centura) and I replaced my old flat screen CRT TV for this. In both cases I'm getting way more bang for the buck. My favorite things so far have to do with menu options. I can control the aspect ratio of the image so I get a realistic picture. Also, the speakers, while not great, are adequate, and there's an equalizer function to help old folks like me who lose a bit at the high end. It's not great, and speaker volume is marginal, but both work well in a small room.All in all, it doesn't blow my socks off, but it does what it's supposed to do, does it well, and won't drain the bank account. 4 stars easy.Angle of view is a bit of an issue. I sit a bit off to the side and the screen is a tad dark. If I rotate it both my wife and I can see it fine.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for small room", "Author": "Cookie", "ReviewID": "RZIVZUNJZHUPT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice looking flat TV.

When I do, it's either because I'm really pleased or really peaved about a purchase.  In this case, I just have to put my two cents in about this TV, and Samsung TVs in general.Picture QualityWe have several LCD / LEDs in the house, both Sonys and Samsungs (including this one - the UN28H4000).  The picture quality of all of them is beyond amazing with sharp lines, vibrant colors and deep blacks.  All are great for viewing everything from the news to football games.  I'm not really a \"gamer\", but they all seem to display the action from my Xbox nicely too.Sound QualityWhere Samsung separates itself is in the sound in these smaller TVs.  With a big screen, you're almost sure to want to combine it with some kind of separate sound system (surround, sound bar, etc.).  But darn it, I didn't want to HAVE to buy a separate sound system for a small TV that's going in the kitchen.  Samsung is the only brand I've found that comes with adequate speakers, which seem to be full-range as opposed to most others which emit treble and mids only.  I wouldn't say this Samsung sounds \"great\" (we do have both a Bose surround system and a Sonos sound bar in the house).  But it has a nice full sound that's certainly *better than* good enough for watching - and listening to - whatever show we're interested in while having dinner or a midnight snack.  All the other brands I've heard sound like overdriven headphones when turned up beyond a whisper, and that includes Sony, LG, Visio and Toshiba.True, this TV is not a \"smart\" TV.  You won't be streaming Netflix or your favorite TV from Amazon without a secondary device.  But it doesn't - as others have stated - claim to be a smart TV in this ad, and that's not what I was after (however, in defense of those other reviewers, it does show up as a smart TV in a comparison table I found here on Amazon, and that is incorrect).  So for what it is, I give it 5 stars!", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor speakers", "Author": "Larry Schmitt", "ReviewID": "R2SUS6CCI4AXHM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As the speakers are to the rear of the TV, sound is muffled.

We like it a lot, although we have nothing to compare it to.It has a perfect picture.  The sound could be slightly better I think, but again, maybe I don't know how to accomplish a better sound.I am still using 2 remotes to operate it, as I have been on two trips for family, and have not had a chance to  check in to get the Samsung code from Verizon yet.  Might improve.We are glad we bought it.  Good price. Good picture.

I love this TV. It looks amazing and was REALLY easy to set up. I'm talking 5 minutes from box to Bizarre Foods America. The description says that it's 720p but mine actually goes up to 1080p. I talked with an online rep from Samsung who told me that if it allows for me to select 1080p in the dialogue box, then it is definitely 1080p and I believe it. It looks great and functions even better. Trust me when I say, grab this TV while it lasts.
