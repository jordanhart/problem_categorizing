{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Eric Aderhold", "ReviewID": "RFW3WHZKUAM1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV a couple of days ago. I'm quite pleased with it so far. The picture is bright and colorful, and the built-in speakers are quite adequate.Setting up the TV was simple. To assemble the stand, you just need to install four thumb screws in the base. Then just plug everything in, and you're done. The channel setup was also quite easy.The included remote is designed to control the TV only. While this means you might need to have multiple remotes around, I much prefer this style of remote to the \"universal\" remote that comes with many TVs because it keeps the number of buttons to a minimum, and universal remotes are often missing a button or two for your device's specific features anyway.This TV should have all the inputs most people will ever need. It has four HDMI inputs, two component inputs, two composite/S-video inputs, and a VGA input for easy computer connectivity.The TV's stand swivels quite easily. It doesn't tilt at all though, so you're stuck with the default vertical orientation.All things considered, I'm happy to have purchased this TV so far. I was taking a chance on the AOC brand (had never heard of it before), but it seems to be a good quality product overall. The only unknown so far is the unit's longevity. The TV comes with a one-year warranty, but I hope to be watching this TV for several years longer than this.*** UPDATE ***I have had this TV for just over two years, and it's still running strong. I notice no difference in its performance now compared to the day I bought it. I have no regrets about this purchase.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "SIMPLY GREAT", "Author": "Gerald", "ReviewID": "R1VGTE4CMIY3ZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own four lcd tv's.
