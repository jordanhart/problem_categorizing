I bought the TV at best buy because they matched a competitor online price and that also brought the 4 year warranty down to only $159!  Once the tv was delivered (free!) and my HD from directv was set up (free!) I was blown away by the quality. Great color and sharpness, I have it hooked up via HDMI and it is great.  My brother has the samsung 1080p and I can't tell the difference.  The connections are conviently located on the left side of the back of the tv and the sd card slot which is a great addition is on the left side of the tv along w/ some more inputs.  It took me about a week or so to finally customize my own picture setting, I did not like the preset ones that much, either to dark or the vivid is to bright and contrasty.  There is no VGA input but I got the pc hooked up via the s-video.  Only downfall is if you use the SD card slot to view pictures it is very very slow at processing them, I suggest using the usb slot or the cords that came with the camera.  Overall I would definetly suggest this tv especially for the price, you cannot find a better deal on a new release plasma tv.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Item", "Author": "Mark Twain \"pan tv\"", "ReviewID": "R2BXHX1MGFEEW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love these Panasonic Plasmas, you can't go wrong.

Initial delivery was scheduled for 7 days after I placed the order over the weekend. First call from shipper moved the delivery up 3 days, second call moved it up one more day. Delivered on Wednesday, just 3 days after placing the order.Truck showed up with just the driver. Was expecting two people, but one was enough to get the job done. Brought it in and unpacked it. I had the wall mount ready to go, so he attached the brackets to the TV and hung it on the all mount. He hooked up the cables from my Dish Network receiver and checked it out. Very happy with the whole procedure, and tipped the driver $20.I was a little disappointed at the initial picture quality. On both Fox News HD and CNBC HD the faces looked a little muddled, like the resolution was not exactly right. Movies on HBO HD looked ok, but still not a good as I thought they should be. I thought about putting my 32\" LCD beside it to see if I could see a difference, but never got around to it.After two day of viewing, the picture is now perfect, just what I was hoping for. The only change I made was to switch to Cinima mode for the TV settings, but I don't think that is what made the difference.Not sure why it took a couple of days for the picture improvement, but all the problems I noticed initially are history. I couldn't be happier with this TV, especially the price and delivery. Best Buy had this TV for $989, but free delivery only applied to $999 and above.", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wow.

The cinema experince of them was great tho, so much more depth than the new LCD, and much better black levels. And believe me, that makes a HUGE difference in overall picture quality.Well I have run 1080i on my Vizio 37\" LCD tvs now for a few years, and was extremely satisfied with them. The picture was very vibrant and colorful etc.This TV is a FIFTY INCH.... and it blows the DOORS off the 1080p Vizio 37 inch I had in its place. The viewing distance didnt change, so its actually TOO close for a 50 inch, and its still just stellar. The red is a bit bright, but I know TV images and there is ZERO blooming ( fuzzy glow) to the reds  ot other high contrast images like whites and reds. Imagine white credits on a black screen... if they are hazy, contrast is bad, if they can remain very bright but still have crisp edges, you have yourself a very nice TV. Like this one.  There is full adjustment to picture and color temperature, the sound is pretty good, def nothing to complain about. Its a classy TV, piano black etc.I was VERY concerned about the 720p issue, and I have to tell you, the fact that its plasma seems to completely soak up that fact and make it disappear. Again, the look of PLASMA is far better than what I percieve on the 120Hz LCD models.  I was completely ready to have a bit worse picture quality to have a 50 inch in my living room, and it far surpasses my other tv's/ I seriously go to sleep watching my 1080i 37 in the bedroom ( hooked up to full hi def mind you)  and it looks like im watching a mobile audio sytle LCD monitor in the back of a car headrest in comparison. And just a few days ago, I thoght it was just great.Complaints? It is HEAVY.  Big time heavy. Its do able as one person, but Im a pretty big guy... otherwise its a 2 person gig to move it. Keep the box as you will need it to move it to a new place etc. And the fact that the cables attach behind the tv all the way to the left side sucks..... hard to hide cables that way.Im not a fan of the remote, but this TV is sick.ALSO: the SD card viwer.. very cool. It somehow ( I never read manuals anymore) blows up the images and displays my phone pictures ( 3.2 m pixel) in 50 inch with amazing clarity.. dont know if its upconverting them etc.. but they look friggin hi def too.. crazy.I looked hi n low, this was THE best deal avail, in town or otherwise.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "++++great value, even better picture++++", "Author": "E. Purchaser", "ReviewID": "R211QTTJ0SSHM5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll sum this up in two words, amazing picture! I bought this tv to replace a 37\" Sharp Aquos LCD and it's been the best electronics choice I've made in a long time!  I really enjoy this tv to date, which has a strong contrast ratio 30,000:1, which just dwarfed my older LCD that had only 1,200:1, I won't even discuss the refresh rate (but actually was not an issue on the Sharp).  Furthermore the value per inch is really unparalled given the quality of this tv.  Having done my homework, a 1080p is really a marketing gimick that is not discernable to the average home viewer and furthermore inflates the costs significant, so with little content available or going to be abailable anytime soon in this format why waste your money?  It's not as though 1080p content won't display at all!  Panasonic got it right with this tv and furthermore the weight is surprisingly managable given the fact that Plasmas were always considered heavier and bulkier than LCDs.  I've yet to play Nintendo Wii on this tv but I'm sure that Tiger woods golf will be a lot of fun.  The only complaint that is that I have an HD feed from Direct TV (yes, I use HDMI and didn't pay $50 bucks for a cable, paid far less on eBay).  The remote code 10250, plus the second 960 code doesn't allow for changing inputs with the universal Directv remote (that's no fault of Panasonic).

I am in the midst of rebuilding this home and have lots of other expenses so I was looking for a big screen TV which was affordable. I originally was set on buying an LCD but after reading the pros and cons of plasma, I changed my mind. I read many reviews and Consumer Reports before choosing this one. I had it shipped to the house (I am in a rural area) at no extra cost and am extremely happy with the set. The picture is great. The setup was fairly easy and even the daytime viewing (which plasma sets get a bad rap) doesn't present any problem at all. The only drawback is the sound. It is not the best but I intend to add external speakers to improve that. The speakers are in the back of the set and point down. My set is located near the walkout basement stairs and the sound travels straight down.

I read the Amazon reviews which were stellar overall, and read the CNET review.  I read the Plasma TV Mag review after I bought the plasma, and it may reflect some of the issues I'm having.And the value - WOW - I got the set at Best Buy for $769 - they wanted to beat the Amazon price at the time.Let me confirm a few things mentioned previously in these reviews:1.  It does take a few days to \"break in\" the picture.  The picture has gotten better over the two weeks I've owned it.2.  The frame is extra-glossy and doesn't help the already-reflective surface of the plasma3.  The picture controls are very limited and not nearly as numerous as what you would find on a Sony or other setThe biggest picture quality issue I'm having with this set is jaggeed edges with higher sharpness settings and very dull and poorly defined faces with lower sharpness settings.  You really have to play with the settings quite a bit.  Overall, closeups on people and other imagery is exceptional, but objects in the background are very fuzzy, washed out and dull, almost colorless in some situations, for example crowds at a football games appear blurry and dull.  I found by increasing contrast and reducing brightness, I could help this a bit.  The Plasma Mag review confirms this problem.  I would say this is the biggest difference versus an LCD, visuals do not have nearly the sharp edges or color depth.  Sure, the blacks are much better, but I would love to have better color depth.For example, if you're watching ESPN NFL show or something, the faces of the commentators at a distance are extremely fuzzy and poorly defined.  But up front, incredible.  LCDs are better at this I think.Here are my settings, so maybe somebody can help:Picture Mode - CustomContrast - 77Brightness - 57Color - 44Tint + 4 (reds are too red)Sharpness - 48Black level - LightOverall great set but I'm constantly playing with the picture settings for different types of shows, which I don't like.And you can't really expect perfection at this price!", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "D.

That's a TV! O_o", "Author": "Daniel Drown", "ReviewID": "R37UE7YP15CUU6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For me the biggest contention was price point. When I went shopping for a great TV my biggest factor was bang for the buck. I'm willing to spend a few extra dollars on a superior product but the 1080p version benefits just simply do not justify the cost at this point in time. HDTVs have come down enormously in price so I jumped off the Standard Def wagon and man am I glad I did!I am not a tech nerd. I know the difference between HDMI, component, and S-Video but beyond that, I'm your average Joe. So just bear that in mind that you're reading from the perspective of a pretty \"average\" user.Benefits/Pros:This TV has it all. Unless you're one of the tech nerds who want to play with the color for about 6 hours on the minor details and are upset that it doesn't allow you to change pixel 1,235,068 to looking more green, the picture quality is nothing less than outstanding right out of the box. I did play around with some of the preset color setting modes like \"Cinema, Game, Vivid.\" I found Vivid to be a little too vivid and dialed it down. I'm actually watching \"Game\" right now and it looks beautimous on HD. I've also heard some say the picture quality gets better after a short period. I haven't really noticed a difference though. Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder so you be the judge.HDMI ports are plentiful, the side panel is convenient. The Bezel white strip at the bottom looks fine. Some reviewers have complained of it, but I don't have any problem with it. As far as menus being a labyrinth, I don't really think that's true either but then again I'm not trying to change that pixel to looking more green. The TV is not really that heavy. It's a little bulky being 50 inches but honestly, when you compare a 50 inch TV 3 years ago in weight, this one is on slimfast.I also did not find any issue with heat. It's been on several hours yet the heat output is relatively minimal.Cons/Drawbacks:No VGA inputs! Argh! Oh well. I don't plan on connecting it to my computer but I mulled that over in my head and thought it would make for one killer monitor. Although I think that there may exist the possibility of connecting the TV up to a video card that has an HDMI output. I'll explore that later down the road but for now, I'll just live with it.Well what some have said about the remote is true, it is very crowded with Viera buttons and is very easy to accidentally press one while accessing the main menu. This is a minor issue.Unknowns:My main concern right now is product life. I've got at least a year of one year warranty but have been considering purchasing a warranty above and beyond that.Burn in. I do play video games so I have to be cognizant of the possibility of burn in. Supposedly not a huge issue as I've read that even burn in can go away after awhile but I'm still mindful of it.My PS3 sometimes does not immediately work with the TV connected through HDMI. I had to reset it a couple times for it to pick up the signal. Now it works seamlessly but I'm still concerned that maybe it might call in sick one of these days.Conclusion:If you buy this TV you will not be disappointed. Unless of course, you are that tech nerd who needs that pixel to be a certain green. Then you might have difficulty but assuming you are a pretty normal average Joe like myself, then have at it! The bang per buck equation for this is definitely THE BEST and I've spent HOURS researching which TV had the most Bang/Buck.I am completely satisfied and excited about my new TV =)This concludes my review!

The only audio-out is digital-optical.  Who ever heard of a TV with neither audio-out RCA plugs nor a headphone jack nor even a miniplug audio-out?  I bought this TV to use while on the treadmill.  I also bought the highly-rated Sennheiser RS-120 WIRELESS headphones to overcome the noise from the treadmill as I watch TV.  The powerbase of the Sennheisers is designed to connect to the TV with 2 RCA plugs or a supplied miniplug adapter or a 1/4\" jack, none of which is accomodated by this TV.  I've emailed Panasonic and Sennheiser and Monoprice for advice, and will update if/when I find a solution (perhaps you, Dear Reader, will leave a comment if you know how to work around this?).  But if any of you have, say, an old receiver or VCR with no digital-optical connection, beware.  Update 12/30:  I stumbled on three fixes, in order of least cost:  Type \"Gefen\" in the Amazon search box, and up pops a $65 converter and a $112 (with shipping) converter, the former for stereo and the latter able to handle 5.1 audio.  Or for $100 more, Amazon offers LG, Sony and Panasonic full home theater systems (type \"Home theater systems\" in the Amazon search box)at $229 with digital optical in and pretty good customer reviews.

The 720p resolution is perfect for me. Obviously, there aren't as many picture adjustments as say an xbr series from sony, but they'll suffice for the average consumer. The card reader for photos is quite useless as its slow. There is the usual buzzing sound but its quite inaudible from a distance. Pilot freight delivery was excellent and prompt. What's leaving a sour taste in my mouth is that we bought the tv for about a hundred bucks more than we had to. I thought i'd just reiterate to everybody that Amazon has discontinued its price guarantee policy meaning if the price drops, even a day after delivery, they will not refund the difference. Of course, this helps profit on their end, but most retailers these days have this provision. So, make your decision wisely, and don't buy ahead of the usual sale (ie July 4th sales) thinking you can get the difference down the road.

Ordered on Sunday, estimated delivery was for Friday. I noticed on the cryptic tracking info that the TV appeared to be at the freight terminal the day after I ordered (Monday). When the status didn't change by Friday, I made some calls tracking down the freight company & found that the TV was indeed just sitting at the terminal, which I found out was less than 3 miles away. I went & picked it up myself. On that next Tuesday (8 days after ordering) the freight carrier called and asked if they could deliver it! Yes, it was free shipping, but I probably could have picked it up the day after ordering it! Now on to the TV itself...Since this is my 1st flat panel TV (plasma or otherwise), I really can't compare it to others, but I am extremely happy with the picture. I used the opinions of other reviewers and consumer reports to settle on this set, and when it comes to bang for the buck, this is truly the sweet spot.Since I don't have other \"modern\" TV's to compare this set with, the following comments are not meant necessarily as criticism of this particular model or brand, but I find it odd that:1. You have to screw around with the format settings on all of the channels. I am hooked up to Comcast basic cable, and I can get like 90 channels, but they of course all vary in format. One channel might be 480i normal, the next 480i letterbox, the next 720p normal, 720p letterbox, 720p wide 1080i normal, 1080i wide. While the set can sense some of these and adjust accordingly, many others need to be set manually (about 50/50), so that even when it does correctly set to the optimal format, you still have to cycle through all of the format settings to be sure you have the best possible. I have found that even on the same station, the settings vary from program to program, even program to commercial and back, so that if you set it perfectly lets say 2 minutes before the start of what you actually intend to watch, you will have to cycle through the settings once your program starts to make sure you are using the optimal setting for that actual program. Don't even think about setting it during commercials, they vary like crazy. Now I know why I see so many sets left on the full wide setting even when the program material is not meant to be viewed like that. I figure most people just give up and watch stuff unnaturally stretched to fit the screen, rather than screw with the ever changing formats. I'm sorry, but by now you'd think they'd have a way to auto-sense these formats. It's not like this stuff just occurred and they haven't had a chance to adapt.2. You have to manually set the clock. A small thing to be sure, but I have a 10 year old VCR that sets the clock itself. Unless you're gonna use the timer functions, it doesn't matter anyway. But seriously, is this now rocket science? Nothing like modern marvels!3. Non-lit remote. Once again I have a few 10+ year old lighted remotes lying around. What a convenience! Fumble with this remote in the dark, and you'll wish for the good old days too.The following items are set specific (as far as I know)4. A very nice operating manual that somehow doesn't explain what things do. Like the format settings, it explains them, but when you're done reading it, you still can only figure out things by screwing around until you can figure out what they're trying to tell you.5. Deep sub-menus that you'll never figure out (see 4 above). My favorite is menu item is C.A.T.S. Yes, I have a few, but even they're unimpressed. I'm simply  too tired to figure that one out.6. Stupid remote design. Other than being non-lit, it is cluttered with Viera-Link buttons. If you are one of the very few people who actually use Viera-link, yay. For the rest of us, they're just in the way, and when you press one of them by mistake and end up in that useless menu, you will have to start wading through the menus all over again to get back to where you were when you made that fateful mistake.Over all a great TV, and for the price you won't do better. As far as the logic behind the flaws mentioned above, ya gotta wonder, what were they thinking when they did this. Maybe these basic design flaws don't exist in the $2500+ sets, but for that kind of money, I'll never know. If you remember the good old days, you'd bring home a TV, plug it in, hook up the cable, and you were done. If you had to set the color, contrast, etc., you generally only had to do it once and you were good to go. I feel so old...", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Major Bang for the Buck!

I got the 50\" X1 a couple weeks ago from sears for $699 + tax - 8% Bing cash back - 10% sears coupon = $625 boom!) After reading many positive reviews and checking it out at Sears next to other TVs' - namely the LG50-PQ30 I went with the X1. Both the Panny and LG were pretty comparable. I had trouble telling them apart side by side.  The LED TVs are the only things out there that have major WOW factor but way too pricey.I mean... a 50\" [name brand] plasma in the $600s' is insane!  I REALLY think the 720p plasmas are the sweet spot in the flat panel TV market. It's just not justifiable to spend the extra for 1080p or LCD 120Hz units.  For 50\" and under screen sizes just about everything I've read says 720 vs 1080 is virtually indistinguishable.  In stores I was hard pressed to tell the difference.  On a budget I don't think you're sacrificing the farm with 720p even if it seems out-dated.  On the plus you're getting a BIG TV for at least $300 - $600 less than similar 1080p models.  I used those savings to buy a PS3!  You should use them to buy speakers if you need. read on.PROS:The Panasonic has great blacks.  You can't even compare LCD blacks to this.Solid, sharp picture - although you HAVE to tweak the picture settings. The factory settings are red heavy and dim! No big deal.  [...] has a thread which tells you how to set if up if you aren't sure what means what.Easy Setup, sturdy base system.CONS:No analog (component) audio out.  This is really only an issue for people that plan on running audio from the TV direct to a stereo system, rather than running the signal from your cable box, into a stereo receiver, then to the TV.  There is an digital optical audio out however, if the speaker system you have accepts that, great.No PC-in - again, not a big deal for most people but a nice feature they should have added.  If you're planning on using the TV as a monitor most of the time, take a look at LCDs over plasma.  You'll get better love with resolutions on LCDs.The Speakers in the X1 are ok for people that don't care about sound. You're buying an awesome TV. spend a couple hundred on speakers.  That said, the speakers on the X1 are WAY better than my new 32\" LCD Samsung 720p, and just fine for watching the news.CONCLUSION - Killer buy you'll be stoked and have money left over to buy other stuff.

I know picky! My first prerequisite was a Plasma Screen, the lag in even the finest LCD/LED TVs drive me mad. Many people can't see this phenomenon and I'm fine with that. A bonus with the plasma screen is the large off-axis viewing, meaning that the picture looks as good from seats to the side as it does in my direct view comfy chair. A second prerequisite was 1080p, or so I thought. My preferred viewing position is 12 feet from screen to eyes. At 3 feet, real 1080p Blu-ray did look better on a Sony GXDL52H1 1080p screen than it did on the TC-P50X1 720p. But, at 10 feet the differences were not so apparent and at 12 feet, I could live with the difference.  When you factor in that the Sony is $4200 vs. $700 for the Panasonic, the choice became a no brainer. It is only TV folks! You will find that TV broadcast is 1080i, if not 720i. It will be a while before you can get the full benefit of 1080p. I figure when that time comes, I'll move this one to the den and buy into 1080p. Maybe by then the price will have come down, too. A few reviews have complained of compressed blacks. The picture controls fix that problem handily. Early reviews found a moir\u00e9 effect in the bright whites caused by the screen overlay glass interacting with the plasma screen. I did not find this to be so with the present production. I have found later reviews pointing out the same problem, but under closer scrutiny, I found them to be parroting the old reviews, to the point that errors were repeated. The Good: A great picture at a bargain price. Sure, there are better TVs, but expect to pay at least twice as much for a discernable difference. The screen is non-glare, a real plus in our viewing environment. Standard TV does not have the weird artifacts that I have seen on other HDTVs. The Bad: I miss PIP. Also, I hate having to go to menu choose the input. I would prefer direct access from the remote. The audio is on par with almost any other HDTV, which is to say, not great but bearable. I would have liked TV remote controllable RCA outputs so I could hook up my (cheap) little surround system. I don't really want to run regular TV through the `big' surround system all the time to get better audio.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Rocks...", "Author": "leffinger", "ReviewID": "R1FJIN45QXU5FT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Due to a wall mounting incident with my old 42\" Viewsonic LCD HDTV, I was forced to replace it.  Long story...let's just say that if your kit comes with any thick plastic spacers, you should use them so you don't penetrate too deep and damage internal electronics of the TV.I did all the research, and the reviews are fantastic on this TV.  Plus with the recent price drop, it's a steal of a deal.  For me, I am converting from LCD to Plasma.  And I love the brilliance of the plasma compared to the LCD, and the blacks are really black.  The picture quality is awe inspiring.  And gaming on it is a dream, if you are into that.  I seriously doubted the people that said a 720p set could look like 1080p.  But there is truth in that statement.  My old set was a 720p and looked no where near as good as this one.  Currently I am running HD channels through my local cable provider (component since Motorola has no HDMI output) and DVD/game content through an Xbox 360 (HDMI).  I suspect HD channels would look even better with HDMI feeds, but that is what I'm stuck with for now.  I don't have a Bluray player yet, but drool at the thought of how good it will look.By the way, I used the wall mount kit on this TV (being sure to use the spacers) and it looks even more beautiful hung on the wall.Everything is easy to setup as far as menus, etc.  The stock sound is sufficient.  But honestly I have ran surround sound for so many years, anything less don't sound right.  While connection inputs are very good (3 HDMI's, 1 component, 1 composite, etc), there is only a digital TOSLINK fiber optic audio output.  I like to run my components directly to the TV and then use the audio out to my Yamaha receiver so I did have to purchase a new cable (was using analog red/white cables before).  Wow, what a difference!  It sounds like I am in the middle of the action now, way better than before.  While quality is much, much better you do need to make sure your audio receiver will accept TOSLINK connections.  Most newer units should, but double check so you aren't disappointed.What seemed like a disaster at first, has turned into a dream come true in the end.

(not really Amazon's fault) Excellent picture quality, nice deep blacks, great contrast & color. one of the nicer remote designs I've seen, very intuitive, easy to use.  Bright enough for daytime viewing. No comment on sound, went directly into my home theater. Ample inputs. As with all plasmas, very heavy, but a large sturdy stand (16\" X 17\") keeps it stable. (Plasmas do take awhile to \"break in\" before picture quality is stabilized.) The TV is 48\" Wide and 32\" High if you are trying to put it inside a cabinet. Amazon's sale price made it a no brainer.Other reviewers complained about S-Video quality. None of the HD sets I've seen do well with SVideo input. Plan on using composite, HDMI, or the Red-Green-Blue hookup. I've only seen one set of this size with a slightly better picture -- at 3 times the price. Unless you are Blueray addict, or sit 3 feet from the screen, you'll not be unhappy with 720 resolution. I doubt most viewers would be able to tell the difference.The location of the plug panel (on the lower, left, rear of the set) is cosmetically a bit distracting, but with the heft of this set, and the size of the base, it makes it much easier to hook up cables.

Theres a reason for all those +ve reviews - this unit is truly outstanding! Will be upgrading to HD soon, but 480i TV looks pretty decent from 10 ft away. and 480p dvds look just great on this TV, as sharp as my old panasonic CT-27D10 tube. I watch a lot of foreign films and channels, most of which are not in bluray or HD, so i thought this TV was perfect for me. if the price is down to 3 digits do not hesitate to buy this tv. BB said I can return this tv till jan 31st and my amex card adds 1 year to the warranty, so I didnt miss out much by not buying at costco. I opted to bring it home myself after reading a few reviews of tvs broken in shipping, and delivery people not honoring the assigned date/time.I initially considered lcd but decided on plasma since I wanted no image deterioration from different seating positions in the living room. And the prices were great. I initially favored the TC-P54S1 but the price difference was too big for me considering i wont be watching bluray anytime soon, and most HD programs are 720p. And in that price difference, i bought a panasonic TC-L32X14 LCD for the bedroom.Sound is not an issue since I have a receiver. I like that this tv has 2 component video inputs, so I dont have to get a new home theater receiver just to accept hdmi when i upgrade to HD.couple of things. only warehouse stores sell a simlar model, TC-50PX14, called a \"derivative\" in the industry. It looks the same, but there are 2 differences - the X14 has a 15000:1 native contrast ratio, the X1 has 30000:1, and the X14 has no 24p mode. this info is from the panasonic website, and is not in the manuals. now this may not make a huge difference in viewing, but it helps to know these models are not identical ([...]) .the tv's box is 53 x 35 x 12 in, for those who want to take it home themselves. this info is from the panasonic website.Update 3/8/10: I have had this tv for 4 months now, and it still works great. BLuray picture looks great (using the DMP-BD60 player, bought from amzn). No increase in black levels like the kind reported on other panasonic models (58S1).

King", "ReviewID": "R1GX70IC1H95W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this televison yesterday and was major disappointed due to the fact that the screen was broken in 2 or 3 places.  The reason was due to the fact that, no one told the consumer to never lay this tv flat. It must be kept in an upright position during and after transport.  Although ours had never been laid on its side, but was picked up that way.  We took it back and the salesman at Sams Club told us that whomever brought the television out to us in the store, should have had it upright.  If the television is laid on its side or laid flat, it has some type of gas and the gas is very heavy and that is what will cause the screen to break.I have found out from doing the reviews prior to purchase that quite a few people had experienced broken screens right out of the box.  It states it on the box, but Panasonic needs to put this extremely important information directly on the front and top of the box in huge bold letters to avoid this problem.  Other than that, this television is very easy to setup and operate.  The picture quality is bold and up front and in your face beautiful to see.  We purchased the 720p and we also saw the 1080p in the store side by side, and there is very minor difference in the two, except the 1080p has a little bit more of a sharper color.  I was told that when you purchase or if you have an HD receiver and the cord with the gold end, you get the exact same picture as the 1080p.  My sister has a 32 inch Panasonic Viera, and before she hooked it to her HD receiver, she still had a dynamite picture, but when she hooked it to her HD receiver, it was mad with color and clarity and features. She said she could see pock marks and freckles in peoples faces.  That is how clear this tv shows clarity.The one thing that I am glad this television didn't have that my RCA HDTV had was, the Convergence feature.  The RCA Convergence had us having to have it repaired every year after the 2nd year.  The cost of repair was $200 plus, and that is the reason I kicked my RCA out of my bedroom and soon to be leaving the house.I will be a Panasonic fan now, and RCA can forget about me and my husband as buyers of anymore of their products.  This Panasonic is worth every penny, which wasn't much.  I purchased mine on Sams Club web site and used the Click and Pull feature and was given the online price of $797.00 and I went to the store and paid there.  The in store price at Sams for this same tv is $1198.00.The Panasonic Viera 50 inch with 720p which is the pixels, is alright with me and I will be buying more tv's for other rooms in my home.  I didn't know how good watching tv was, and I didn't know all this time, that I had been watching a dead tv until I got my Panasonic Plasma.Buy this tv and you won't be sorry, and the sound is amazing and the features are too numerous to tell you here.", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous Picture but have questions", "Author": "R. Wolf \"Wolfdoctor\"", "ReviewID": "R2UTGQ927JRXT8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought the TV at a local store.  Believe me when I say this the picture is much nicer at home than in the store.However one should understand before purchasing this TV that there is glare/reflectons if there are windows in front of the TV.  Additionally the frame/border wround the picture is high-gloss.  The relections on this border are very bright.  To some people this might be a problem. Luckily I watch most of my TV during the evening.  When I do watch it during the day, I sit on an angle from the TV that doesn't show the glare.  A suggestion I would make to Panasonic would be to make the border non-glossy.Another issue I have is there are warnings in the manual about burn-in.  You are warned in the manual about the possibility of burn-in in the  top/bottom black bars or side black bars when watching letterbox or 4:3 material.  The manual just says that if you view the TV for a 'significant' period of time, then burn-in can occur.  What should I do?  What is a significant period of time?  Should I change channels frequently?  There is an option to scroll a white bar across the TV as part of the anti-retention setup menu, however the manual doesn't say how often this should be done.  If I am watching a letterbox movie, should I take a break halfway through and scroll the white bar?  I've read online that scrolling the white bar actually reduces pixel life.Overall I am happy with the TV so far, but I really don't want to be worring about burn-in.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "What else do you need?", "Author": "Franklin Peach", "ReviewID": "R3OK7NKMIJB6C9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV for 9 months now and I truly love it, no it is not 1080, but can you really tell? and at this price?

We were going from what was supposed to be a superior new technology in the JVC LCOS 1080P 56 inch set (that was honestly quite nice when it wasn't blowing bulbs) down to a 720P 50 inch budget model plasma (which was rumored to be old dying tech with too many problems at the time) and from the second we got it set up we could hardly believe our eyes....This budget model of an aging dying technology was a much bigger upgrade on that 1080P 56 set than that new super set had been on a 46 inch Toshiba rear projection set. We were all floored by the quality of the picture this set was able to produce and in all honesty the picture got even better as the set was fully broken in and then calibrated (not professionally but by myself with set up discs) we are just now looking to replace this set and even that is only because we want to get a 3D Panasonic plasma (I have found a Panny 20VT from 2010 lightly used for just $700ish) and move this into our main bedroom.The black levels are still top notch, the colors pop, the sound is much better then most flat screens even though we usually use the 6.1 through the receiver and it is very versitile as it obviously looks its best with 720P sources it looks great down converting 1080P blu-ray and does a much better job handling 480i/p content then our two 32 inch LCD's (a Samsung and a Toshiba) do with it despite it being blown up on a nearly 20 inch bigger screen.I'm still thrilled with the deal we got from Amazon on this set $719 with free shipping, in fact this deal is what lead to me going from doing a little shopping here and there from the site to being a Prime member who buys from them more often then not. In terms of value, this TV is without a doubt the best big ticket item i've ever bought to this point and certainly the best value.I have had other HDTV's to compare this to over the years myself and at my friends houses, one of my friends bought a 1080P Samsung plasma last year and though i'd say it has the better picture it was also newer tech and hundereds of dollars more. In my opinion Panny has the plasma market down to a science, they are well ahead on the budget models and they consistently have won on the top end model every year since the Kuro's stopped being produced too.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "720p produces great quality", "Author": "Jerome H.", "ReviewID": "R3H23NMPMJH2BO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my living room and was initially concerned whether or not to go to for Plasma.
