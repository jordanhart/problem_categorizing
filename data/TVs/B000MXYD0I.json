{"Reviews": [{"Title": "King of the Hill", "Author": "G. King", "ReviewID": "R1CR227TZXMZ47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the first year, Toshiba has badged all of its LCD HDTV models as \"Regza\" which stands for Real Expression Guaranteed by amaZing Architecture.  And amazing architecture is what you first notice when you get this 42\" 1080p LCD HDTV home.  The piano black finish is currently in vogue with high end electronics manufacturers, but upon close inspection the black is actually covered with metallic flakes that give it a deep luster and shine.  The soundstrip speaker with SRS Wow technology and formidable bass reproduction is recessed neatly along with an accompanying  brushed stainless steel strip along the bottom.  The TV is solidly connected to a swiveling base which extends several inches in front of the stand in a large crescent shape to lend stability to the set when it is placed on a tabletop or shelf.  The inputs are neatly recessed in the back facing downward for ease of access if and when the set is mounted on the wall.  All in all, when turned off, this TV serves as a cosmetically appealing centerpiece to a living room or den.Be prepared: when connected to SDTV (or basic terrestrial cable), the channels appear grainy and washed out.  This is because HDTV's all display SDTV fairly poorly; they are equipped to handle much higher resolution sources.  So, when connected to a 480i source such as SDTV cable, the picture is poor compared to a CRT TV, whose native resolution is 480 lines of resolution.  Prepare, when upgrading to any 1080p set, to purchase a cable or DrectTV package with HD channel programming.  If you're hesitant to upgrade to HD broadcasting, probably put off the purchase of any HDTV capable of displaying 1080p, and either buy a larger CRT TV or an HDTV only capable of handling 720p.Toshiba REGZA LCD TV's incorporate what is called CineSpeed into their panels.  This essentially means the set employs an 8 milisecond or faster response time for refreshing the image displayed on the screen.  For fast moving situations like sports, or high contrast movies with action packed sequences, this feature is invaluable.  All previous ghosting associated with LCD TV's has been eliminated, and even bright white objects moving across a dark background look smooth, true to their color, and leave no trail.  DynaLight dynamic back light control makes the black truly black, and the whites vivid (almost comparable to plasma TV's with 10,000:1 contrast ratios).  Other features unique to this Toshiba Regza TV are ColorBurst wide color gamut and PixelPure 3G 14-bit internal digital video processing.  These options, together, make the picture displayed from 1080 p sources unbelievably clear and flawlessly reproduced without overscanning.In response to a review posted for this TV, VGA is a virtually obsolete connection.  Most high end computers use either DVI (which is also mediocre) and higher quality media center PC's with Windows Vista premium use an HDMI compatible graphics processing unit with an HD rated display.  Few TV's allow a 1080p source from a VGA connection.  XBox 360's downfall was not using HDMI compatible hardware - this is additionally where the Playstation 3 far exceeds the XBox 360 in terms of hardware with built in blu-ray that incidentally looks outstanding in 1080p with this TV, but also using HDMI as a connection method.  This set is comparable in terms of response time and dynamic contrast ratio to the higher priced LG 42\" 1080p model, and beats it in terms of picture tweaking options.  The Sharp 42\" Aquos 1080p HDTV has a horrible (1,200:1) contrast ratio and is almost not worth purchasing unless you plan on sitting directly in front of the TV.  Also, if you plan to sit 2 inches in front of your TV, you probably aren't intelligent enough to own one - the difference between 720p/1080i and 1080p is only noticeable based on how close you are sitting to the television and 2 inches would be close enough to notice jagged edges in even ultra XHD or cinema digital which displays beyond 1080p.  Close enough, all smooth lines look jagged and that is the nature of the pixel - pixels are square, therefore all curved lines are composed of a series of straight edges.Also, LG's comparable 42\" 1080p HDTV is less than 100 dollars more expensive than this Toshiba, and for the record, LG is only in its second generation of LCD TV's whereas Toshiba is in its 3rd generation (this is the first year for the Regza badge).If you're upset about the component inputs and the VGA not handling a full 1080p signal, buy a 1080p upconverting DVD player (under 100 dollars now) with an HDMI output (I suggest Samsung's DVD1080P7 which has an optical out if you want to hook up to a home theater system).  This TV has 3 HDMI inputs and can more than handle all your AV needs.  In all, this Toshiba model outdoes Sony's XBR Bravia, Sharp's Aquos, LG, and Samsung models.  The dynamic contrast ratio, coupled with the Pixel Pure 14bit processing power produces a sharp, clear picture with unbelievable smoothness, clarity, and vivid realistic color reproduction.  In addition, this is one of the only TV's in the under $2,000 range that includes a remote that can be used as a practical universal remote.  Some techies love their fancy touchscreen universal remotes a la Logitech Harmony 1000, but this remote is solid, has great range, and is a fitting match to the solid TV it is paired with.  Not at all the cheap hunk of plastic you get with the current Sharp LCD TV's on the market.The price of this TV, which encompasses a design quality shared with $3500 Toshiba Regza sets, unique Toshiba features like CineSpeed and Colorburst,  1080p native resolution, and 3 HDMI inputs make it the best value under $2,000 and comparable to much more expensive sets.  Whether an audiophile or just someone looking for a great affordable LCD HDTV, this set delivers.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing Quality!", "Author": "P.

I was interested in the 42\" Sharp Aquios LCD 1080p before I was on my way down to the store to view all TVs in person. When I got there I saw the other tv I i was slightly interested in to compare it to the Aquios was the Toshiba REGZA 1080p and was blown away by the resolution of the promo they were playing on HD DVD, the price and of course 3 yrs same as cash pan they had on Toshiba tvs. Needless to say I was sold! I got the TV for $1519(minus tax) score. I am a big fan of Toshiba from the TV I replaced which I bought in winter of 2000 which has never given me problems. While I was there I picked my Toshiba HD-A20 1080p HD DVD palyer to replace my original DVD player that I had purchased back in 1999 and paid $400 for, and agian never gave me any problems. Viewing both \"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Corpse Bride\" were amazing at 1080p and I'm a stickler on resolution. Needless to say I side with Toshiba there products and HD DVD.

I read the previous review and I guess I can see that it's not the most premier picture in the HD universe, but it is still pretty outstanding.The key here for 5 stars is value - for around 1600 with shipping or tax you're getting a 42\" flat panel with 1080P (built for the future). It's also Toshiba's 3rd generation technology whereas many of the Bravias and Sharps are still on their 2nd generation.So, while maybe not the top 1% of HD pictures and at times you see some pixelation (very minor, possibly due to the inferiority of the source) it costs less than half of some of those monitors. If you're looking for great value this is the TV - remember that you'll pay about $125 for nice HDMI cables to hook it up properly and you can get the whole package for a great deal.", "Date": "May 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Phenominal... but you gotta work for it.", "Author": "C. Mickles", "ReviewID": "R1U3HW6SDPK1ZP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First time product review so, be kind.The Toshiba Regza 42HL167 is a phenominal value.  I wish that were all there is to say about the set, but, it's not.  So, let me continue:  You're getting 1080p resolution, an over-the-air tuner (most still don't have a built-in tuner), plenty of high-quality connections (including HDMI, DVI, Component, etc.), and the ability to fine tune all of your color settings to the nth degree.  When you put all of that along side Amazon's prices, and your bang for the buck get's huge.That said, why didn't I give this set 5 stars?  Well, that's pretty simple.  Out of the box, the picture on this TV looks pretty horrible.  On [...] there's a pretty lengthy discussion of the green push on these sets.  Basically, many of these sets seem to have their green levels jacked through the roof.  It affects the quality of your dark levels and even just some simple shade.  It really makes some of your first movies look horrible.  To sum up, I'm docking this TV a star for such a bad out of the box experience.  I don't think you should have to spend an hour+ callibrating your set to get a good picture.  Fine tuning, sure... but these color settings weren't even in the ballpark.Anyway, after spending some quality time callibrating the set, the picture is just gorgeous.  Even using my Xbox 360 to upconvert my DVDs, the picture is great!  After all was said and done, I couldn't be happier with the TV.  The picture is great!  Halo3 in 1080p is a beautiful thing, and, all of the content I throw at this TV looks fantastic... I just can't wait to put HD DVD or Blu Ray.To sum up, as long as you're willing to spend some time working on your picture, you'll end up with a fantastic looking TV.  If playing with your settings is something you're not interested in, I'd suggest you stay away.", "Date": "November 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Hi Recs for Hi Res", "Author": "imu ilu \"143\"", "ReviewID": "R3CXRIR1OL4PKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome picture quality.

Laham \"TarTar McGee\"", "ReviewID": "RYTBXYNVQD3TP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchasing a TV was a huge deal for me. I didn't want to buy a lemon but I also didn't want to completely break the bank. So I ignored the budget TVs (Westinghouse, Olevia, etc.) and I tried very hard to ignore the luxury TVs (Sony XBR2). I basically had my sights set on a Samsung, a Sharp or a Toshiba. After reading hundreds of reviews on each model under each brand, visiting electronic stores, and talking with money-burning friends, my research pointed me towards the regza.Although samsung has a very vibrant color, life expectancy has been very short for some friends and design wise, they are the ugliest (IMHO). Although the sharp has the deepest black and said to have the greatest contrast ratio, there has been problems with gray banding and reviews came up a little over par. What convinced me on the Regza was the price.The shiny black frame looks amazing on my tv stand, the picture quality is fantastic, the built-in speakers are impressive, 3 hdmi. VERY happy with it.Only probs I came across were: 1. takes probably 5 seconds to warm up and turn on (which does not bother me in the least bit) 2. no picture in picture (my ADD will have to deal with it) 3. the VGA connection does not work with my computer (granted my video card is old, I noticed reviews on the web saying other VGA PC connections didnt work either. I think the tv is very specific as to what resolution it will allow to pass through. BUT I plugged in a MAC via DVI to HDMI and it popped up fine and looked absolutely amazing. tempted to buy a mac mini and just stick it next to my consoles for web browsing.)", "Date": "September 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pretty good LCD.  Picture could be better.", "Author": "Travis", "ReviewID": "RSEXHIMQNUAHW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Keep in mind this was the first time I purchased an HDTV and don't know much about them.  I owned this TV almost a month before returning it.  Overall, it's a good TV.  Picture clarity is excellent and the sound is good too.  I've read that LCD's have a difficult time accurately showing blacks but in my opinion the black levels are awesome.  It's got a lot of features such as parental controls, the ability to add channels to a list of favorites, and built-in NTSC/ATSC/QAM tuners that will allow you to pick up unscrambled over-the-air channels without having to get digital cable or an antenna.  I was able to pick up NBC, ABC, CBS, WB, FOX, and ESPN all in HD using Comcast.  There are 3 HDMI ports and a VGA port if you want to connect your PC.Here are some things that bothered me.  You cannot set a clock on this TV.  I thought it was odd because I'm used to having it on my Panasonic SDTV.  Also, if you change the TV to a channel you want to watch later and leave it on that channel for a minute before you turn the TV off, when you turn it back on it will not always be on that channel.  A big complaint I have about the TV is most images have a greenish color to them during certain dark lighting situations on the screen.  Skin tones and yellows also have a greenish color.  I thought it was a problem with the TV but I went back to Circuit City and looked at the two Toshiba Regza's they had on the floor, the 42\" and 47\", and they both looked the same way.  I didn't notice it before I bought it because the 42\" I looked at was playing a HD-DVD demo disc so it was difficult to get a good idea how things would look because the action on the demo was so quick.  A good way to see what I'm talking about is to get a sales person to turn on ESPN HD on some of the TV's and compare the \"ESPNHD\" banner on the left and right sides of the screen.  With the Toshiba, you will see it is a greenish color.  The sales person admitted to seeing the problem and was not able to remove the greenish look from the TV.  I also tried to remove it myself but had no success.  If I lessened the greenish color it would hurt other colors or the image quality.  I just decided to take it back.  If I'm going to pay a lot of money on a HDTV I want to be completely happy with my purchase.

Even component video will not do 1080p. Limited to 1024x768 through PC VGA port. Seems to be picky about HDMI 1080P input. I tried a cheap RCA upconverting DVD player, but the TV would only accept the HDMI signal at 480p, 720p, and 1080i -- not 1080p. I haven't had a chance to test any other HDMI devices (thus, I have never had the TV actually display 1080p).Update: Been running the TV at 1080P for months, works flawlessly. Make sure you have an HDMI 1.3 cable (which should not cost more than $20USD).Previous problems with 1080P went away when I replaced the cable.

First off, I'd like to say that this TV has more color calibration options than I ever thought would be available on a TV.  You can adjust RGB, magenta, cyan, and yellow color channel values.  You can also specify color temp and adjust the blue or green channel drive values within each color temp setting!  The on screen menu system is one of the nicest, simplest menu systems for a TV.  Everything is clearly laid out, easily explained, and easily accessible.  Now there are a couple of sticking points with this TV.First, I wish it had PIP.  Second, this TV has a tendency to push medium gray-scale values towards a slight tint of green when it first comes out of the box.  This IS CORRECTABLE.  With all the color calibration options on this TV, it was very easy to correct this, but it is a must.  You need to calibrate the TV when you get it.  The third point is a slightly lesser viewing angle.  True, you can see the TV very clearly from 176 degrees off axis but the blacks tend to become gray much quicker than they do on a set made by Samsung.  (This was the only major difference I noticed in the stores)The overall finish on the TV is exquisite, remote is responsive, there is a power saving option that comes by default (so the TV takes about 5 seconds to start up.  This can be disabled for a faster startup time if you prefer)  Overall, for the price, this is the best value you can get on a 1080p LCD TV.  I have it hooked up to my media center computer through a DVI > HDMI cable and the picture is truly stunning.  If you use MCE2005, you might need a 3rd party software like Powerstrip in order to view stuff at 1920x1080.  Windows Vista just works out of the box.

People are saying color has a green tint(easily correctable by tweaking settings on tv): I have not experienced this at all.2. Slow to turn on: doesn't bother me + can change in options3. Viewing angle: the Blacks definitely start to distort if you look at the TV from off center but this is not a problem with the way my living room is setup.DVD's w/progressive scan player(480p) look great, macbook output is very nice withHDMI-to-DVI cable 1080x768.  Our cable service only has 10 high def channels(1080i & 720p) which look great. The standard def(SD) 480i channels do look pretty terrible but It's manageable for us at our viewing distance.

Comparing features this TV had to other brands ,this TV was comparable to much higher priced  LCD HDTVs. Go and check out TV's in your local stores and compare prices, pictures & features. Then armed with your info look on Amazon or elsewhere on the internet. You will be shocked at the savings !We chose this LCD HDTV, and are very happy we did ! This is our first LCD HDTV and though we are not techies ,we wanted a good picture, good value and reliability.We had Comcast cable ,no HD ,but did pick up some shows in HD and the picture was good. We now have Dish HD and the picture is AWESOME ! So if you get this TV do get HDTV from cable or satellite to get the most out of your 1080p.  The first night we watched 3 HD movies on HBO !! We were amazed at the clarity  & colors ! The sound is good,too. So good, we haven't hooked up our home theater system yet. We did purchase an HDMI cable to use and like others have stated it DOES make a difference in your picture quality !The swivel stand is a + for us ,and is not mentioned in their advertising.Having a big picture window in the room, the black matte finish was also a big plus ! There isn't any glare on the screen from that or at night when we have lamps on. An LCD Samsung we looked at in Circuit city had a shiny screen and had terrible glare from their ceiling lights. Be sure and check this out if windows or lights is a problem in your room.We also liked Amazon's price and shipping/delivery method. With Amazon's white glove delivery, the TV is brought into your home unpacked, box and trash taken, but I would keep the box and wrappings for 30 days in case you have to return the TV. They will then set the TV on your stand, turn it on and make sure you have picture and sound ! We saved hundreds of dollars over buying locally.

I did some extensive research before investing nearly $1,200 on this LCD HDTV and I must say that you can never go wrong with Toshiba. I have been a Toshiba owner for the past 12+ years and my oldest TV set needed repair after 9 years of use (a worn out tuner card; my fault for using high power VCR units in the antenna connection instead of the AV input). If you are looking for cheaper competitors like Sceptre or Vizio, remember you get what you pay for. You may be saving a few hundered dollars buying the cheaper brand but you will save the headache later during your ownership period.The picture quality on this HDTV is the best I have seen on a 42\". I have looked at Sharp's AQUOS, Vizio, Secptre, Panasonic and Mitsubishi and I absolutely fell in love with this. The only two things that I did not like on this TV is that:1) The PC input only goes up to 1024x768.2) There is no PIPThe free shipping is also great. The courier called my house and made an appointment for delivery. It arrived at my door set with not a single scratch. I instaled this TV on my wall using a swivel wall mount.

Falcon", "ReviewID": "R2HLGQV4ZVLGJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got a great deal on this TV at my local Best Buy and picked it up based on reviews and on-line research.  With the introduction of LCDs with the 120hz refresh rate and motion enhancement technology, this HDTV still looks absolutely incredible in terms of resolution, color and contrast.  Blu-Ray movies look unbelievable.  The first movie I tested on this set was Disney's Cars, and the image was so vivid I felt as if I could reach in and touch Lightning McQueen.  The picture was bright and the colors were rich and accurate.  Properly transfered films on the HD (Blu-ray) format look better than ever.  You can see every blemish, sweat drop and pores of the actor's face in great detail.  This set has a 60hz refresh rate, which makes cinema look like real cinema, whereas a 120hz set with motion enhancement technology tends to make films look more like live broadcast (the \"soap opera look\" if you will). While this is great for viewing sports and documentaries, movies tend to lose that cinematic feel we've grown to love, and movies that have a lot of CGI such as Transformers look really fake.  I won't argue that those images also tend to be crystal clear and seems as though you're looking through some sort of magic mirror into another world.  Yes, it would be nice to have a 120hz set with the option to select a 60hz refresh rate when viewing movies, but you'll be paying more for that technology as well.  The CineSpeed works flawlessly and I've experienced no strange artifacts or motion blur.  When viewing films such as Sunshine on Blu-Ray, you become so immersed in the film because the visuals are so stunning and this set delivers what your eyes deserve to see.  I'll admit that I own most Blu-Ray titles purely for eye-candy and not so much for the film itself.  But when you have a great set like this you just want to throw everything at it just to see it beautifully rendered on the Regza.  The viewing angle is great and I could be sitting well outside of the ideal viewing \"sweet spot\" and still see a great picture.  This set also really shines when playing video games on the Playstation 3.  It has really taken my gaming experience to an entirely new level.  Games such as Call of Duty 4 feels like you're controlling the action in a movie, not just playing a game.  Simply beautiful.  There are enough inputs for everything in your high def cabinet I'm sure of it.  The TV offers much in the way of tweaks and adjustments, and plenty of picture size options to choose from depending on the input source.The cons:  The built-in audio leaves a bit to be desired, but I'm assuming anyone purchasing this for their home theater will be using a dedicated receiver and surround speakers.  There's a lot of noticeable noise when  viewing standard analog cable TV broadcast, but I can live with it.  Not everything I watch has to be in absolute HD, but it would be nice.  Subscribing to HD cable or satellite will do this set justice.  There is no PIP, but I didn't use it much when I had my old 55\" rear projection set.Overall, this is a great package for the price.  This display looked just as good if not better than some of the more expensive HDTVs when viewing the floor models side-by-side.  Not to mention this set looks really beautiful even when turned off!  Very sleek, stylish and sexy, and it's the perfect size for our modest living space.  Our guests are always blown away when they see the picture quality.

I waited to write a review after putting it through a fairly extensive test period.This TV is nothing less than outstanding.  The picture is gorgeous.  The set looks humongous since it replaced a 26 inch LCD.  It is a little heavier than I'd prefer, but having a swivel base surely helps.  The default picture setting is set to \"sports\", which has a very bright and unnatural color scheme.  After playing with the regular setting choices, I found the \"document\" setting to be the best for my eyes.  This set has many input choices, and I like the fact that it has a set of AV inputs on the side.  This is very useful if you mount the TV to a wall, or it's hard to get to the back for any reason.Hooked up to my standard cable connection, it picks up all the unscrambled digital channels.  This means I am able to watch my local broadcast channels in their full HD glory!Our XBox 360 is connected through HDMI, and games as well as movies are truly breathtaking.  Because of the size of this TV, I came to realize that not all DVDs are made equal.  The difference between poor quality DVDs and the \"near HD\" quality ones is suddenly quite obvious.  I'm still going to wait to get a blueray (or whatever the next HD standard) disk player when they cost less than $100.  Until then, I'll be very discriminating when purchasing DVDs.I like the power saving feature in this TV, even though some reviewers find it annoying.  It causes the TV to take a few seconds before it powers up.  This delay also allows for the other AV components to turn on and get ready for the party.  ;-)If I have to pick something to complain about it would be the remote.  Sure it has all the functions, etc, but it performs poorly.  I find myself having to press a button several times to get it to register.  Perhaps it's a problem with the batteries.  Nevertheless, I am using a Harmony 880 remote instead, and it works fantastic.  No problem.I hope this TV is good for many years of moderate use.  Time will tell.

So if you get a bad panel, it isn't necessarily Toshiba's fault.  They buy the panel, then build their brand of TV around it.

I previously owned a 56\" 720p Toshiba (which took me 3 months to decide on buying) and I needed to get something smaller due to space and also desperately wanted something to show off the 1080p capabilities of the ps3. I thought about purchasing a Sony XBR, Samsung, Lg, Sharp, and JVC. Putting the important factor of value aside even, this TV blows everything out of the water with the exception of the Sony's which it competes with very very well. I have watched all sets side by side repeatedly as well as analyzed all tech specs before deciding to buy this and it was well worth it. First off the people that say 1080p is not noticeable on a 42\" screen are utterly insane-flat out. In my guest room I have a 42\" 720p Sony and this resolution blows that out of the water. If you are sitting within 10 feet YOU WILL notice a big difference! I cannot place an emphasis on this enough and do not understand why people can think any different on this issue. Also, if like me you were worried about the new 120hz technology making its way into LCD's and whether or not its worth it..... well im very fimiliar with TV's and have a perfectionist eye for errors in picture and I realized that compared to older LCD models or ones that just plain out aren't good, 120hz is very superior for motion scenes. HOWEVER in comparison to this TV and other new, good spec LCD's THERE WAS NO NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE! Motion scenes look absolutely perfect on this and I actually noticed 120hz models sometimes suffering from a 3 picture effect where a moving football actually looked like 3 footballs.-So in conclusion this TV is unbelievable... well worth any price you can get it for and definately the best value for under $2k.

Compared this with EVERYTHING in a store, for two hours or more- could not beleive the richness, the crispness and liveliness of this particualar set.No dullness like other LCDs, no 2 dimension really life like, really true.And a bargain- compared it to many high priced PLASMAs and LCDs.  In a league to its own, thought it was a plasma and made the salesman prove it was not.Combine this with a SAMSUNG BDP-1400 BLUE RAY DVD player for upgrading your regular DVD movies to outstanding quality. Don't even bother with a ps3 FOR PLAYING REGULAR dved- NOT EVEN CLOSE.  THis Player makes ordinary DVDs near 1080 like quality- amazing.  kEEP YOUR existing DZVD collection no need to switch exiswting titles to BLUE RAY with this player. Undelievable. If your going to make the leap to large flat panel buy thiws player at the same time and consider yourself done for a while. FRewallyu complete.  I bought this player for 599 and now I see it here for less than $299.  Buy the HDMI cable here too, Amazon wants like 25 bucks for an HDMI cable that in a store they get $100 for at Radio Shack and CC and BB.Have fun- make the jump into pure movie and HDTV splendor.MAKE SURE NO MAtTER WHAT TV YOU BUY GET 1080P NOT 720. Don;t let a hundred or two sway you get the best. Over the 10 years or more you might have these sets the extra money is nothing for 1080P and you are getting this set to upgrade- upgrade to the best now not 2nd best or third best.  1080P is the only sets you should be considering.", "Date": "February 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Defective One!", "Author": "B.
