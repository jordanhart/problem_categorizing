I called Polaroid customer service and waited, on hold, for 4 hours, yes, four hours. Once I talked to someone they said they would send a repair person to my home, the repair person never called. I called customer service again and again waited 4 hours. They then informed me that they would send a replacement which of course was on back order. I called them again and they said they would refund my money if I sent it back in the original box, I did at a cost of $85.00. They never called when they recceived it so I called again and you guessed it I waited on hold 4 hours. They informed me they had received it and the refund would be in 4 weeks. I waited 8 weeks still no refund and I called again, this time I did get someone immediately. They wanted the UPS tracking number, the product serial number, and where I purchased it. Without this they said they could not provide the refund. I provided the information (second time) and they said I would have my refund in another 4 weeks. To date I do not have the refund.", "Date": "September 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "nice, when it worked", "Author": "D.

I decided to email customer service, instead of call. I've been quoted, yes e-mail is in writing, 2-4 weeks for the part and then someone will call me.  Amazingly they didn't have any questions about the issue, so my bet is that Poloroid is well aware of a faulty part. It was great while it lasted; hopefully they will resurrect.", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Perfect Television for Your Bedroom . . .", "Author": "Dr. E", "ReviewID": "R92YO91QCJP7Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This television is the PERFECT size for your bedroom . . . it's not so huge that it looks ridiculous and it's just large enough to enjoy films from your comfy bed!!Unlike most Polaroid flat-screens, this one has a monochromatic frame: therefore, not only practical, but aesthetically pleasing!!  Moreover, there are no buttons what-so-ever on the front of the frame, but there are ones cleverly hidden on the side (just in case your dog steals your remote and you need to change the channel before checking under beds!!) So the presentation is uniform!The set-up could not have been much easier! (Just in case you are not having the Geek Squad coming to your home!) I had it assembled and was watching \"Army of Darkness\" in under seven minutes;)Unless you are using your PS3 on this television for films, I encourage you to pick-up an HD-DVD player (or one with a High Definition Upscaling. . . which also works FANTASTICALLY and is MUCH MORE affordable!).  Your old DVD player will not work well with this television unless it has a High Definition Upscaling (just check your DVD manual, you may surprised to find that it does!!) And don't forget the HD cable WHICH IS CRITICAL!! I also strongly encourage you to pick up a surge protector: the Monster Cable MP HTS800 Home Theater PowerCenter HTS800 is incredible! (And it's pretty cheap here at Amazon!!! I had to be convinced into investing in this surge protector, and everything I read indicates my friend was correct! So, I guess this is an area where you don't want to take the cheap way out!) I know this may seem frustrating, disappointing, OR JUST PLAIN EXPENSIVE, but you will not regret it!!So, while this television is not ideal for your living area (a larger, plasma would be the choice . . . and for very little more!) this is perfect for your bedroom! I would have given it five stars, but the remote control is pretty stripped down . . . and not especially impressive. But hey, that's what Logitech is for, right!!??", "Date": "January 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great for the price!", "Author": "PAdude \"-PAdude\"", "ReviewID": "R2ALQ1YDTHTZXI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about 2 years and I love it!
