However I couldn't get past the awful sound from the downward facing speakers when placed in a recess. I just wanted voices to be clear but they were not despite tweaking the numerous audio settings available. I bought the Vizio E291i-A1 because it had front facing speakers and these proved far superior for this kind of installation - not a home theater quality but plenty of volume and crisp clear voice unlike the LG. After tweaking settings on both I was also able to get a noticeably better picture on the Vizio in terms of color, contrast, and detail. I'm very pleased with the picture. The LG does have a wider viewing angle but fine detail seems slightly soft - and it's just not as life-like. I didn't originally care about smart TV features but I've found they're a big plus for the Vizio - the Netflix app is a pleasure to use.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV.

They don't sell this as a DC set, but I discovered that it uses an outboard AC to DC power supply, just like a laptop computer, and the voltage is 19 volts just as with a laptop.  The wattage is also comparable to that required by a laptop.  I have a DC to DC adapter for my Lenovo laptop and found that it would power the TV off of 12 volts very nicely.  I did have to construct a male to female adapter so that the laptop supply would plug into the TV, but all it took was a couple of small parts from Radio Shack.  So, if you are looking for a 26 inch TV for an RV, Sleeper cab on an 18 wheeler, or for tailgate parties, this TV works very well with the right adapter, and it's a heck of a lot cheaper than the ones that are sold as 12 volt sets!", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Daughter Loved It -- Especially the Energy Saving Capabilities", "Author": "Glenn A.

My space required nothing wider than 28\"...so I was limited in choices...and shut out of the most common 1080p 32\" units available.I purchased the 29\" LG LED TV.Pros:  It is cheap at around $300.  It fit the space I had...the TV was 26.3\" wide.  The \"pros\" end there.Cons:  The screen resolution is worse than you would expect from a 720p resolution on satellite (DirecTV).The picture adjustments, although aided by a nice on-screen app, are clumsy. The results from the app make you want to try it yourself for color and contrast balance.The instructions and documentation are very poor.  I called Amazon tech support, which provides 30 days of free advice on this unit.  Even they had no documentation for the unit.The component inputs and outputs are very bare bones.  In fact, the unit provides NO AUDIO ANALOG output.  Therefore, you can forget about piping this into your media center receiver.  The downside of this is that the speakers on the TV are subpar...so you better be using this in a small room.Compared to the 8 year old Samsung I was replacing, the interfaces available on this LG were primordial.  Did I mention it was CHEAP?The stand is not adjustable, so that if you need to center the unit in a media cabinet, you just need to stack up some books.  The overall styling is very generic...Over all, if you have time to consider other units, do so.  There is no reason to waste time on a unit like the LG when better 1080p units should be available soon in this size (29\") class.Amazon gladly offered to take the unit back, but had no replacements in the size range.

I'm not a huge TV watcher but I do watch a lot of movies, so I just needed something relatively small but large enough to comfortably watch films on, and I stumbled across one of these at the store that was being sold for $135, discounted because it was a store display. Took it home, hooked it up within five minutes, and put on a movie; the picture is beautiful and infinitely better than what I was used to with my super tiny Polaroid monitor. I can't say how great the sound is because I have my DVD player hooked up to a stereo sound system, but aesthetically speaking, this is a really pretty television with sharp and clear picture. I think they normally run around $170, but even then I'd still say it's worth that.
