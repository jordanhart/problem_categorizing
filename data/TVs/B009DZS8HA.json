I had heard all the hype about LED and its brighter colors and what not, so I thought I would give it a try, I am a Panasonic loyal, and thought if it's Panasonic it has to be good? Boy was I ever wrong, first of all I was told this was a 120 refresh rate (Wrong its 60htz) The picture quality of this model is to put it mildly HORRIBLE!! Extremely difficult to adjust, had to make adjustments to any channel I went to, all scenes are very dark and the Vivid setting is a joke! Angle viewing was very limited and darkened really bad, sound is low and tinny. kept it for a month before I decided to send it back, thank goodness for the Costco return policy..I would not recommend this set to anyone, not even for free its that bad.What does work.. The internet worked good as did the netflix and youtube.. I went ahead and ordered another Panasonic model this time Plasma!! What a world of difference, TC-P55ST50 is a MONSTER!!", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super Service", "Author": "William Spofford", "ReviewID": "R27F4N8QAKCU89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TYE-Mart replaced an initial TV damaged by shipper in three days. Pleasant and easy to deal with. TV has super picture and all the reviews I have read are on on the mark. Great contrast and control. Sound is also much better than my previous 32 inch tube TV. Panasonic has always been a great product and was recommended by my son-in-law. Expect to have many enjoyable hours with this TV.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "PANASONIC TC-55LE54 LED LIT T.V.", "Author": "VIPERICHNAPLES", "ReviewID": "R3CSW5RTTZRV6J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "THE PICTURE: GOOD. VERY BRIGHT WITH GOOD NATURAL COLORS. THE BLACKS ARE NOT AS DEEP AS MY OLD SONY. THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. THE BAD NEWS: THE SOUND. HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE, WHAT SOUND ???  AT FULL VOLUME THIS T.V. PUTS OUT SOUND LOWER AND TINNIER THAN A CHEAP TABLE RADIO.  SO, IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS T.V. AS A MONITOR ONLY AND GET YOUR SOUND FROM A COMPONENT STEREO IT WILL BE ALRIGHT, BUT AS A STAND ALONE T.V. THE SOUND MAKES THIS SET A DEAL BREAKER AND I STILL AM WITHIN THE 3 MONTHS AT COSTCO AND I AM CONSIDERING RETURNING THE 2 SETS I PURCHASED.2/22/13 UPDATE:  O.K. I DID RETURN THE 2 PANASONIC TC-55LE54 TELEVISIONS.  I PURCHASED A 55 SAMSUNG L.E.D.  L.C.D.  DEEP BLACKS AND VERY GOOD SOUND.  ALSO GOT A VISIO 60 LED  LCD...THE SET HAS AN SRS SOUND SYSTEM AND GOOD PICTURE....VERY HAPPY, SAME PRICE RANGE ALSO.....SO FORGET PANASONIC AS TO THE MODEL REVIEWED HERE...THERE ARE BETTER T.V. SETS IN THAT PRICE RANGE.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "What Panasonic has done with Plasma, they have now done with LED!", "Author": "Billy Jester \"Clemmons Discount / Sales Manager\"", "ReviewID": "R3FOG8S7YZZK7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best picture I have seen on a LED TV yet, and I should know since I buy and sell a lot on my own store. The colors are so true to life, just amazing. When the screen is completely white, be prepared to need sunglasses, it is that bright! With my Amazon Prime account I watch HD movies and shows on my new Panny at no extra cost. Really did my research before buying, I went around to BestBuy, HHGreg, and Sams' and saw this TV first hand before I bought it from Amazon (note: I was doing other shopping, at these stores, so the research was not a waste). I mean, who can go wrong with free shipping, not having to worry about loading the TV in and out of your vehicle, the gas, the tax. Free right to the door. I would highly recommended the Panasonic TC-55LE54, best purchase I have made all year!
