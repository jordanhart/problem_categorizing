I have the Direct TV DVR and it came with an HDMI cable.  I first noticed a problem when watching football.  On a far shot when the ball is going through the air you see multiple balls.  I then noticed trails when watching Law and Order.  When someone turned their head you would see trailing.  I called Samsung and they stated there is a known issue with this model and I require a firmware update to get rid of what they called triple ball effect.  How do they ship out a product with such a major flaw is beyond me but hopefully the firmware upgrade will correct the problem.  They ship it out to you on a thumb drive and then you plug it into the USB port.  I will post what happens after I receive and install the upgrade.Update 12/28/2007:Okay after writing this review I started to read the reviews for the Samsung 4071f and noticed users were experiencing some of the problems as with my 4069f unit.  There was a good bit of talk about the 120hz being a problem and basically useless.  I went into setup and turned off the 120hz option and poof the ghosting on tv shows like Law and Order and CSI vanished.  Samsung support had me turn off digital noise reduction previously.  If I turn either option on the ghosting appears but with them off the picture is great.  However, the triple ball effect (TBE) is still present when watching football.  I should receive the firmware update in the mail today or tomorrow so hopefully that will remedy the TBE problem.Update 1/16/2008:Okay, as I said in my last update, turning off the Auto Motion Plus 120hz cured most of the problems. I waited for the firmware update to be mailed out but never received it (Samsung input my mailing address incorrectly). They did send me an email with a link to the firmware and instructions on how to do the upgrade. Installing the firmware onto a thumb drive and then onto the tv was pretty straight forward. One thing to note is the email link for the firmware expires in 1 week so download it along with the instructions. Also, the tv will only update if there is a newer firmware version on the thumb drive.I went through and uncompressed the firmware onto the jump drive. Important Note: The firmare is labled for the 4071 model. These models are virtually identical and share the same firmware!!! After loading the firmware I set the Auto Motion Plus to low and the triple ball effect is indeed gone. Samsung recommends setting Auto Motion Plus to low and ONLY for sporting events and other programs with fast moving motion. They say to turn it off for regular programs. Here is the URL to what Samsung says about TBE on the 4071 model:  For some reason the URL won't post but if you go to the Samsung site under Support and then News and Alerts you will see a report for the Triple Ball Effect and LNT series 71 LCDs.  This also applies to the 69 series; I highly recommend reading this alert!", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "excellent true 1080p/120 Hz", "Author": "Luca De Simone \"lucades\"", "ReviewID": "R2H4Y3O7QD1YN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung LNT4069FX 40\" 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTVIf you are looking for a 1080p with 120Hz refresh rate, this is the right choice.

I have been a loyal Sony TV buyer since 1978. I have owned three XBR models. (Remember the one with the foot pedals?) And, yet, I just returned my 40W3000 and decided to go with a Samsung.I could not afford the 40XBR4 and considered buying a heavily discounted XBR2. But, the comments in this forum suggested that it would be better to go with the 40W3000 due to some regular improvements. I also wanted to avoid the XBR2 clouds issue. So, I studied the W3000 at the store and it looked good on the wall.I got the W3000 home and connected it to my Comcast DVR via HDMI and to my Panny DVD player via component video (480i). I do not have a game player and I have not jumped into hi-res DVD, yet. So, to be fair, I am dealing with a 1080i Comcast input and a 480i DVD input. I cannot tell you about a 1080p input.With great anticipation, I turned on the w3000 and I did not get a WOW. The colors looked muted and the people looked pale. My daughter said that there was an unnatural green tint to the picture -- and that the greens looked artificial. But, I saw in this forum that all the calibration choices and began the process. I re-seated the cables and tried different inputs.Now, for the great test. Fortunately, I still owned my 32XBR400 set! I could do a side-by-side comparison on the identical video feed! I hooked up the Comcast box to the XBR tube TV via component video and the new 40W3000 by HDMI.My goal -- get the new set to have the same quality picture as my eight year old tube TV. Could it be done?Well -- I spent days on it with no luck. I tried several settings from the spreadsheet, a couple of others in the forum, and some choices by myself. I ran the Video Essentials DVD and tried to get the optimum settings. I tweaked while looking at both monitors. Nothing was as good as the 32XBR400. Not even close.To be fair, I watched a few movies to see if the input made a difference. But, Harry Potter looked sickly and the clothes on the Devil Wears Prada were drab. (The whites were beautiful, by the way.)Then, my other daughter came by and watched Devil with me. She noticed that the pixels did not keep up with the motion in the running scenes. After she pointed that out, the set was ruined for me due to what I now call the \"slow pixel\" problem. I tried other DVDs and even noticed the problem when faces turned. I turned enhancements on and off. The problem was still there.OK. Perhaps this set was a bad unit. Maybe an exchange would make a difference. (It was an August manufacture date.)I started by returning to where it began -- the wall of screens at the store. I brought my own DVDs and was ready to annoy the sales person. But, it only took me a few seconds in front of the wall to see the \"slow pixel\" problem. Even if I could get the colors right, those slow pixels would ruin the set.Since this is the top-of-the-line non-XBR set, I knew at that moment that if I wanted to be happy with my TV, I was leaving Sony after 30 years.What next? Well, I know that Samsung makes most of the Sony LCD panels. And, my PCs are all connected to Samsung monitors. (And, the AVS Forum was favorable.) So, lets look at the Sammys.Right next to the Sony was the Samsung 4071f. It had a beautiful picture, but I immediately dismissed it due to glare. The glossy screen would not work in my sunny family room. However, the Samsung 4069f is a very new set with a matte screen. It wasn't even on the wall of TVs at the store. But, they had one in stock that found its way to my credit card and into my house. It has a matte screen and is less wide than the 4071f.I was ready to be disappointed. I was ready to believe that it would be drab and that I would need to start exchanging cable boxes and buying a new DVD player. (My wife would love that.)Guess what. The Samsung picture is stunning -- I said WOW. It is vibrant and has a fantastic picture. The standard setting was very close to the 32XBR400 in color quality with my side-by-side test. A smile crept across my face. I know that there is some picture tweaking ahead of me. But, that will be a labor of love. I watched Harry -- without a skin condition -- and even enjoyed the Discovery Channel HD. I could not see any slow pixels (perhaps due to the 120Hz refresh rate, but I don't know.)Finally, the SD test. I like Bravo, BBC America, and the SciFi Channel. All of them are in SD here. The pictures looked great on the Samsung.Sorry Sony. And, sorry to those in this forum who love the 40w3000. It was a hard decision for me. But, I have a new video partner in the Samsung 4069f. I have already invited people over to my house to watch the Pats game on Saturday night. (It is a good year to be a Boston sports fan.)I hope that my experience has been useful. It is very hard to walk away from 30 years of telling friends and family to buy a Sony. Now, I will say to buy Sony for your tube sets and Samsung for LCD.", "Date": "January 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great tv.....here are the calibration settings I got after running Avia II", "Author": "Michael Kane \"World Traveler Extraordinaire  ...", "ReviewID": "RD3OPNUUM6ZGH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here are the calibration settings for 4069FX that I got after running AVIA IIContrast: 100Brightness: 41Sharpness: 100Color: 49Tinit 48Backlight: 10Color Tone: Normal", "Date": "January 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN-T4069", "Author": "Braves Fan", "ReviewID": "R2CFAHTT3HP3WU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is wonderful.

Upon receiving the set I was pleased to find that the out of the box experience was a lot better than what I expected.  Every other system I've set up for friends and family involved the TV looking pretty mediocre or horrible when first plugged in, and then after tweaking looking either good or great.  This TV looked pretty good right after the first power on.  After tweaking the picture is stunning.A few things I really like:1.  Very tweakable.  It remembers the settings for each individual input, and depending on what mode you have it on (dynamic, standard, movie) it allows you complete control over every feature, whether on/off for some, or some nice color and white balance controls.  If you are into tweaking you can go pretty nuts with this set, however as stated above, out of the box it looked pretty darn good.2.  1080p and 120hz.  This is the highest resolution tv you can get as a consumer and it probably will be a for a while.  It is also the same resolution as the high def disk formats so you don't have to worry about scaling when watching your new expensive HD disks on your new expensive HD player.  The 120hz means it can play back 30/60hz broadcast media and 24hz film media natively.  After deinterlacing it either doubles the frames for 60hz or pen-tuples the frames for 24hz, which can help reduce 'judder' effects when watching film sources with a 60hz only tv.  It even has the AMP feature to interpolate and add information so you get something similar to a full 120fps experience, although I'll get into more detail on that later.3.  Pretty full set of inputs, and the VGA input works flawlessly with my 1st generation Macbook.The one thing to be aware of with this set is that the AMP feature currently doesn't work 100%.  Many people notice what is referred to as TBE (triple ball effect) with the feature turned on.  What happens is if, for example, you are watching football and there is a long pass, the ball can sometimes appear to triple as it crosses the yard lines.  In addition I notice that during camera pans the background stutters with AMP on.  Samsung is working on a new firmware to address these issues, but they are not completely fixed yet.  In the past Samsung has gone to the extent of sending techs to people's houses with new circuit boards to fix issues, so I'm sure if firmware can't fix it, Samsung will eventually fix it for us.That being said I'm not really into the AMP right now anyway.  Since it adds frames that didn't exist before it create a super realistic depth to the image, almost making it seem 3D.  To my eye it makes many things look more like animation that real though.  Most people who buy the TV really like the feature so I'm definitely in the minority on this opinion.Still even with the AMP issues, this is definitely a great set and still worth 5 stars in my opinion.  Give the TV and try and I'm sure you will be happy.PS - One last note.  Since this TV is 1080p, and somewhat large (although not nearly the largest available) it really magnifies anything in the video signal.  This can be good or bad.  If there is anything that was not properly done in the source video you can see it.  Some DVDs/TV will look crisp and great, others will look horrible, and some will change in quality from scene to scene.  Film noise, poor digital encoding, all of it you can see.  This should be the case with any 1080p TV from a good manufacturer, so don't jump the gun blaming the TV when maybe a better upconverting DVD player, or just another choice of TV/Movie could make a huge difference.", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Eye candy", "Author": "A. Nadkarni \"aks\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y0ZRSKBU34LW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on LCD TV's.  My first conclusion was that Samsung was the best quality and value.  My second conclusion were that I wanted the following pre-requisites: 40\", 1080, 3 HDMI inputs, Samsung's clear panel (some models don't have it), at least 15k dynamic contract and a slick stylish look.  So I tracked the 4065 price on Amazon to get that....And all of a sudden, while waiting patiently for the right price on the 65, I came across the 69 and 71 lines came out of nowhere.  It was excellent timing! That's when I came to my third and final conclusion, which is I wanted 120hz (after seeing it in action in BB).  The 69 won because of its slimmer look and lower price (only differences I noticed were slightly higher contrast on the 71 model but thicker trim).  Anyway, I spent $1699 or $300 more than I was going to pay for the 65.  It was absolutely worth it.  It's currently $1499, so an even better deal.This set is beautiful in every way, not the least of which is the picture quality and features. 20k contrast ratio is great, but I think above 15k doesn't make a great difference. So the main differentiating factor is 120hz. You can alter the 120hz between low, medium and high.  What this does is eliminates the slight motion blur when people/things move on the screen.  For example, I was watching Snakes on a Plane in HD, and the outline of Samuel L Jackson's bald head when he was moving around stayed sharper than with 120hz off.  It looks amazing, but because it's on TV, it looks kind of like an artificial reality.  So that's something to consider if you prefer a little blur to remind you that you're just watching TV...On my way out to work every morning I spend a few minutes just watching it and admiring it.  I'm at work right now writing about it.

Owned for 3 days.  I was looking at the 4061 since I liked all these features then I was about to order the 4061 for 1299.00 on Amazon and then noticed the 4069 for only $200 more on Amazon (1499.00).  Went to Best Buy to compare and see in person before ordering and I was sold. This is a newer model and newer technology for just a little more.  I'm glad I decided to get this model instead.  I would say it is closest to the 4071 for features and style without the glossy screen.  The 4069 has the 120 Hz auto motion plus, 6ms response, greater contrast and matte finish which I prefer over the glossy.  This TV is perfect for our bedroom.  Great style and performance.  I haven't played with all of the adjustments yet, except lowered the brightness and contrast, but already I'm very pleased with the picture in HD and SD.  I was also happy to see that the TV did have any bad pixels on arrival.  This is my second Samsung HDTV purchased from Amazon (also own the LNS4696 which I also love).

I received shipment 5 days after ordering, which is remarkable considering the Christmas holiday was sandwiched between - kudos to Amazon and Eagle delivery!  The TV arrived in good condition and was a snap to set up.  I'm running all HDMI inputs from an HD DVR and Xbox 360 through an Onkyo TX-SR605 receiver to one HDMI input on the TV.  The picture looks fantastic and I've yet to notice any TBE (Triple Ball Effect) or other display problems.  Worthy of mention is the matte finish on this model, it virtually eliminates glare.  My TV placement puts the set opposite a large bay window, which rendered daytime viewing on my old JVC tube TV almost unwatchable.  With the LNT 4069FX there is ZERO glare!I would advise finding a copy of the THX Optimizer included on many DVDs (I used the Monsters Inc. DVD) and running through the video tests to tweak the factory default settings.  Of particular help was the contrast test, the result was a substantial decrease from the factory preset of 100 that induces a noticable white-out effect.Bottom line - if you're in the market for a 40\" LCD, this model is unsurpassed in video quality and features.

Samsung LNTXX69F has excellent picture, matte screen and 3 HDMI and a decent price of 1499.99 ending today (4/22/2008) at Fry's, or web buy from LCD Store for S1449 & 1564 here at Amazon.4.

Samsung LNAXX550 is a decent unit and sells for under 1200 and on paper has great specs like 30k:1, 3 HDMI but has weaker picture quality to above models.Opted for LNT4069F since it offered best value and performance!

Right about the division between standard def and HD on the screen, on the left side, there is about an inch and a half bright red vertical band, and every thing to the left of this band is completely blurry.

The Samsung 4069 was a good product, but when I saw the LNT4071 at 120Hz with high-motion HD demo content I decided I would not be happy with anything less.  I did not prefer the high-gloss screen of the '71, but then I stumbled upon the 4069 with a matte-finish screen and found my HDTV. Resigned to the higher cost of a 120Hz set, I was not willing to pay the big-box retail price so I became a bit deflated. I was very pleasantly surprised by the Amazon pricing, and no sales tax or shipping.  It made my decision to purchase the LNT4069FX from Amazon very easy with a minimum of buyers remorse.I have not done a color calibration as others have suggested as it seems good out of the box (I will fiddle with it later...too busy watching!).  Side-by-side comparisons with other brands solidified my decision towards the Samsung over anything else.  Performance with cable HD content (1080i) is variable as one could imagine, but very engaging especially with musical content and college basketball...Go Vandy!  I still see some movement artifacts (the trouble with having a superior HDTV coupled with a less than perfect interlaced content) but the 120Hz options help minimize.  I am currently using Pioneer DV-400V-K Multi-Format 1080p HDMI Upscaling DVD Player and I am very happy with DVD playback on the LNT4069FX--vivid and fast, great color.  The brief Blu-Ray demonstration I witnessed was impressive, so now for the decision:  Dedicated Blu-Ray player or PS3.The delivery of the product was more than satisfactory.  I received the order to my doorstop within a week. The shipping company was courteous and prompt in their coordination, and the delivery company treated my HDTV as if it were their own as they brought it into the house.Of one could imagine, I had some apprehension as to the entire experience of purchasing a major electronic device from Amazon.  Heck, I go through the same anxiety with such a large purchase no matter what!  I am glad I did my research--120Hz was perfect, liked matte screen over gloss, 40\" was perfect for my room, price from Amazon was outstanding.  Shipping time was reasonable, delivery was no-hassle.

Calling Samung to inform them of this problem, I was told that yes, this is a defect in specific models produced between a six month period.

Then I started reading about the improvements in the LN40A650 and the LN40A750 . . . offering 50,000:1 contrast ratio vs 20,000:1 for the 4069 and the newer, lower 4ms response time compared to the 8ms of last years model. But, I still wanted the 4069 because it offered a matte finish for the screen, and several reviewers wrote in complaining and regretting their 'glossy screen' purchase. (Besides, I hate the idea of the 'Touch of Color' feature marring the clean, austere look of the 4069.)However, after re-reading again and again my research materials, I am breaking down and going with the LN40A750. It finally comes down to being unable to ignore the future proofing the Connectivity and DLNA features provide.Can someone please explain why Samsung appears to have done away with matte finishes.

Love the picture, features, etc., all of which have been well covered in other reviews. But, it died after having it for a week - dead as a doornail. I called Samsung the night it died, and they set up a repair call with a local (D.C. area) repair shop. I called the shop the next day, and they were on top of it already. They guessed from the symptoms that they would need either a power supply, motherboard, or both, so they ordered them that day, and told me the parts would arrive in a day or two (not 4-6 weeks, as I expected!). Sure enough, they arrived at their shop the next business day, and they set up an in-home repair appointment for a few days later. The tech showed up on time, and replaced the power supply. Viola - worked like a charm. So, we all know that s--- happens, and that the after-sale service is what's important. I'm more than satisfied with the way Samsung and the local shop handled this. The TV's been perfect ever since - it's been a few weeks.One thing to note is that this TV, and some other newer Samsung models have a known issue with connecting the TV to Verizon FIOS Motorola DVRs over HDMI, which is what I do. The TVs sometimes don't recognize the \"mode\" (480i, 480p, 720p, etc.) being sent by the DVR, and displays a \"Mode Not Supported\" message that can only be cleared by resetting the DVR (power-down/up cycle). You can find lots of information on this by Googling \"Samsung FIOS mode not supported\". I've been able to limit this problem to only once or twice a week by following some of the instructions in the various forums, and I think Verizon is working on a permanent fix. For now, the only 100% reliable fix is to use component video cables, which degrade the picture ever so slightly.

When they came home that night - boom! Their measly old 19\" CRT had vanished and in it's place was just a blackness, filling the main cavity of our entertainment cabinet - 40 inches, to be exact. They were quite surprised, as you would imagine. And when I fired up Blue Planet HD for them, the 'wow' factor was just so evident in the air that it took some effort to keep from grinning.The main reason for why I chose this TV over all others was that it was THE one large-screen Television set that made a perfect fit within the bounds of the family entertainment enclosure. Situating it in the shelf, minus the stand, I discovered how close a call it was - hardly more than 1/4\" to spare on every side. The top actually rests against the mount pins for the shelf above it, which was perfect, since now having no stand to hold it upright, it would have otherwise fallen in backward. Like my title states, it couldn't have been a more perfect fit. There are lesser reasons of course - Samsung's renowned picture quality and construction, the sleek, straight-forward and jet black design, as well as the ability to use 120hz interpolating.Some of the key settings of my set are as follows:contrast 90brightness 45sharpness 20color 50tint 50/50backlight 6color tone normalThe most important setting of all for me, though, was the Mode. This is an LED back-lit set, you must realize, and if you ever look at an LED light next to an incandescent bulb, you realize the color tone is 'cool' or blueish compared with the warmer feel of traditional lighting. This was especially evident this past Christmas when I drove by a house using LED Christmas lights (if I ever needed a reason NOT to buy them, that was it). The Samsung at it's Default settings, gives off this same blueish look that I don't find terribly appealing. Setting the Mode to 'Movie' seemed to magically make the picture not look like it was being lit by LEDs.There are many other settings for fine-tuning the picture, like black-level adjustment, noise reduction, etc., but I've left most of those at their default 'auto' setting or off.Picture quality is excellent and bright. I've never seen any artifacting or ghosting, as some others have reported. Stardust HD looks amazing.The 120hz works just as advertised. It works with any HDMI source... which is fine, since all A/V sources are routed through an excellent Yamaha RX-V661 receiver unit (would never buy any other brand of receiver) and to the Samsung via HDMI. This means you can watch virtually anything with interpolation. I have it off by default, though, since the feature causes motion to look unnaturally smooth and tends to attract attention to itself, but it is fun to turn it on sometimes for the 'wow' factor and if you are watching the right thing it really can be spectacular (Documentaries, Sports, high speed action sequences in movies, etc.) We don't own the Matrix, but I can imagine how liquid smooth the 'bullet-time' scene would appear...Coming close to a year old, this set has been a solid performer and I've never had a reason to regret my decision. Come to think of it, every screen we've bought in the last few years has been Samsung, including my latest acquisition - a 61\" Samsung DLP Television. I am, as of this writing, killing time and waiting for my Oppo 983H player to arrive so that I can fire up my first movie on it and check that the screen has no problems. Technology is great!

But the display is generally excellent, especially on the 16:9 digital channels.Some of the SD channels tend to the  muddy side but we haven't played with setting them up a lot.  Also, I recommend leaving the SD 4:3 ratio pictures in their native form. The set will stretch them to 16:9 but the result, for me, is ugly.Auto-tuning takes too long as others have posted (about 20 minutes). But after it's done, we can receive digital signals via the Comcast cable without a cable box.  And, through some quirk of the cable service, we can receive some apparent on-demand or pay per view offerings that neighbors may be subscribing to.  How else to explain that certain digital channels are being rewound as we watch them?  The movie will get to a certain point, then rewind back to the \"good part\".  There are some rather exotic tastes in the neighborhood.  Cable company says it has no idea how this happens and I'm not pursuing it with them.So far, I don't detect any motion artifacts like ghosting or image trails. The audio is clean and full-sounding.The bad: shortly after we got it, the set developed an intermittent condition where the left half of the screen was slightly less contrasty than the right half making it appear there was a line down the middle (but there was, in fact, no line). It could be cured by turning off and turning back on. I realized it should be serviced because the condition could only get worse.  We called Samsung for warranty service.  It took the service company about 10 days to acknowledge the service request (I had to call them to ask when service would be rendered), another few days for the set to be picked up.  They held it for more than a month and returned it but the problem had not been repaired.  A second service call was arranged and after another month, the set is back, apparently repaired this time. They replaced a \"t-com\"(sp?) board the first time and the entire LCD panel the second.What's really scary is that there are no strict guides (at least here in Maryland) on how many tries the mfr get to repair before they must replace the set.  You are at their mercy entirely.

This TV is better than other LCD TVs on analog channels. I have my old SONY 27\" tube TV next to the Samsung 4069. The SONY looks better in SD.

It is not as convenience when I change channel.4. When I do auto scan for channel, it took 20-25minutes. Some Stations have HD broadcast at certain time. If I did auto scan not in that time frame, the channels would not be detected. I have to go through auto scan again during the HD broadcast period in order for the channel to be appear on the list.

Clarke \"Clarkeasaurous\"", "ReviewID": "R1R852DOXHLZYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV back in January. After 3 months of use, I can safely say I am big fan. The picture is crystal clear. The color is amazing. The sound is great. The menu is easy to navigate. And it looks great just sitting there.One of the big factors in buying this TV was the lack of glare from the screen. I have a of windows in my living room so I wanted a TV with a screen with as little glare as possible--this one fits the bill but without, in my opinion, sacrificing anything in terms of brightness or color.Having 3 HMDI ports is also a big plus. You'll want one for your cable tuner box, one for your DVD player, and one if you have an audio tuner you want to run the sound through (I don't use one--the sound is fine out of the built-in speakers). To say nothing of an Apple TV box and/or a game system. I don't know why so many other TVs have so few HMDI ports--it seems like 3 should be the bare minimum.HD cable looks great on this as do BlueRay DVDs. PS3 games are spectacular. Standard \"low-def\" cable looks fine. The picture simply appears smaller with black space framing the smaller picture. Standard DVDs look just fine too -- the image appears full-size without the need for the black frames (though you will need a DVD player which can upsample to 1080p. I use a PS3 which does the trick flawlessly).The only hitch I have had was with the delivery service. When they called to set up a delivery time, they had nothing available for 3 weeks! However, I was able to drive out to their warehouse and pick it up right away.

Not only did we save $550 compared to in town prices, but everything went flawless. Eagle delivered a unit in perfect condition.The TV is downright awesome. The picture is stunning in HD. SD does not look very good compared to CRT, so if you don't have HD sources I would recommend keeping a CRT or accept that you will not see as clear a picture. It is by no means unwatchable, but you are dealing with scaling and anytime you do that you lose. I am one of those that refuses to stretch a 4:3 image to widescreen so the size of the 4:3 image was important to me, and on this TV (because I found no mention of this on any web site) the non stretched 4:3 picture is 19 \u00be\" H, 26\"W which is  33\" Diagonal. In HD you see what you paid for, stunning quality.120Hz was very important to me as my sporting season involves racing and it does a great job. NASCAR, NHRA, F1 (all open wheel) all have a very apparent decrease in LCD ghosting. It is very nice that you can adjust the level of this feature. Gaming is a huge factor, and while I have not explored the \"Game Mode\" setting yet, it is downright amazing the difference between SD and HD in context of gaming. A few adjustments in the setup provides me a picture that I am most satisfied with, so \"Game Mode\" will have to wait.The sound is good. They are down firing speakers and have decent stereo separation, and the TruSurround XT does a nice job. I would have preferred a little more thump in the bass area, but they are nice for built ins.Cons:Unless it is a hidden feature that I have yet to find, you cannot custom name your inputs. Even my 27\" Panasonic TV purchase in 2000 allowed you to custom name your inputs to whatever you like. On this TV you have only presets choices (such as HD STB, Game, DVD, etc).  You can't input things such as Xbox 360, Cox HD Cable and the like. Since you can update the TV firmware, I hope this is a feature included down the road.

I placed my order late Tuesday night and I was playing my 360 and surfing new channels Friday night (I drove to the facility to pickup, since it was Friday and they were thinking of next Wednesday for the delivery, while I was at work no doubt).The tuner was able to pull down about 60 more channels that I normally get with my basic(no box) cable. I was completely blown away by this as I did not expect to have more channels just because of the Tuner. Now I am searching for a nice antenna.The Picture is amazing! Colors are eye popping and the 120hz in my opinion is great.  I did see the triple ball effect as the Rat moved his hand in Flushed Away. I believe we see this because there are an extra 60 frames being thrown at you; basically the TV is to fast for it's own good, but you can adjust from low-high. SDTV 480i is not as good as CRT, but I knew that would be the case, still very good though. The 1080 is where it's at though.

Amazon was fantastic and hassle-free about picking up the TV and shipping me a new one I bought. (They did not have a same replacement in stock or they would have sent me one immediately.) I bought the Samsung 4071 for $100 more since it was supposed to have better color and a couple more options. I chose to do this through Amazon since their customer service was amazing during the entire process.I hated to see the TV go, however, but did not want to pay more for it when I could get the same line, a better model, for not much more.See review about the 4071. Either TV is great if you are looking for features and color quality. There are many adjustment options to choose from and modify to your personal tastes. Have not used it with a computer or any other electronics other than a DVD player.The HDTV is sharp (also depends on your channel carrier) so I imagine with a blue ray player it is sharp as well. I have a regular DVD player and it looks and sounds great. You can add a home theater for better sound but I think the sound is fine for TV speakers.

I'm sure they will someday add this to the TV as well.Great product and very pleased both with Samsung for the TV and Amazon for their amazing customer service.

The 3rd one was totally fine, I just wanted the 4069.  120hz isn't anything special unless the source works well with it (some football benefits, but normal TV looks strange...)  6ms response time on the 4069 and 20,000:1 contrast compared to 8ms and 15,000:1 contrast on  the 4065.

It doesn't have the glossy front, but when the TV is sitting in your home, you really don't pay much attention to that anyways.My impressions so far are that this is an amazing TV. The factory color settings are ok, but a little tweaking and the picture looks amazing.

This tv beats sony and anyone else in the picture quality department. It will upscale your standard dvd's to 1080p and make movies like superbad, casino royale, LOTRIII look HD. the tv swivels on the stand which is nice when moving around the room. the colors are so vibrant on this screen it's unreal. For me the matte screen is a life saver. I have a very bright room that made getting a plasma with a glossy screen out of the question. the matte screen is similar in texture to the original mitsubishi big screens, so no light is reflected off of it, it works great and doesn't sacrifice picture qualilty.this tv plays 1080p over component which is nice for older-xbox360 owners like me with no HDMI. HD-DVD's look amazing on this tv. planet earth, transformers, king kong, these all look like you're looking through a window. all my friends and family are amazed when they come over and see it for the first time.the con of this tv is the software. version 2004 is the current and it gives the tv stutter, TBE and flickering occasionally. It's not enough to want another tv, but it's once in a while. samsung's currently working on a new firmware update that's supposed to solve these issues with the LN-TXX69 and LN-TXX71 models. if that happens, this will be the best tv money can buy. because without those quirks, there's nothing more to want from an HDTV.
