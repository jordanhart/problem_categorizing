This TV suits my needs perfectly. Its not crystal clear, but it has a good quality that I'm satisfied with. It has lots of inputs in the back, sturdy set up for wall mounting, and the menus on screen are simple. Its a good TV with good sound. And given the opportunity with the same money, I'd do it twice.Hope it helps,Tyler D.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Steffan Larsen", "ReviewID": "RV5MY7L58D8GU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This television is a great deal. I was skeptical about it's HD capability until I hooked up my PS3 with an HDMI cable and altered my video settings. FUll 1080p. I now have it also hooked up to my laptop and am using it as a monitor. For around 350 dollars, Coby makes a great product.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "Jersey Boy999", "ReviewID": "R3EVJC1QWHB4IU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased Coby 26\" LCD TV Model Number TFTV2617 in early June 2009.  TV failed in late October 2009.  Coby's warranty provides 90 day coverage for labor only.  Coby Tech Support is quick to inform that once the 90 days passes, the buyer is on his/her own to get repairs made to the set locally at the buyer's full expense - Coby does not offer factory repair, factory support or referrals to qualified technicians.  I have been unable to find a local shop with Coby repair parts - the TV is now in the trash and replaced with an LG model - a $350 lesson in penny wise and pound foolish.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "NO REMOTE CODES FOR THIS TV!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "L. Greer", "ReviewID": "R33E8PILQGVRX2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "There are no remote codes for ANY Coby television products, so don't buy one if you want to use a universal remote. You will always need to use two remotes if you have cable or satellite. The unit itself is very nice. Good sound, good picture. I like the ease of setting it up. Just take it out of the box and plug it in. No need to screw on the base, like I did for another TV from a different retailer. My only complaint is that there are no remote codes available, even from Coby tech (non)support.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "short life and poor picture", "Author": "Valentin", "ReviewID": "RCDJ99UFWUWQZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this some months ago, and the first to recognize was the poor picture quality when it comes to contrast....the overall picture is way too bright, and if theres a darker scene (in a movie or whatever) you can barely see anything, and if theres a light scene you'll feel your eyes hurt because its so way-too-bright.The default picture setup is way to colorful, but can be adjusted easily.The sound quality was quite okay for build-in tv-speakers, but dont turn it on too loud. ;)The ports on the back (HDMI, VGA, SVHS among some others) are NOT easy to access and they seem to be very weak. The overall construction of the ports-area in the back is poor, I think.After about 4-5 months it \"broke\", means I got a RED stripe on the right side of the screen, straigh from top to bottom of the screen!If you're looking for a decent HDTV for under 500$, I suggest NOT to buy this one...better get a good 720p-HDTV from a more trustworthy brand like Sony or Samsung. Theres some nice ones around, and at that size you dont really need full 1080p.I'm not gonna buy a Coby again, just because this TV had such a low overall-quality, even for that price.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for....", "Author": "Garth French \"Frenchy\"", "ReviewID": "R34X9DOB2EZNLG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well, what can I say.  I am usually a person who does tons of research before buying all my electronics but this one I really screwed the pooch on.The price is right but even after making adjustments on the color balance and contrast the picture was still washed out. I can live with these annoyances since I bought this for the bedroom but the cheap remote broke after 3 months. Getting up to turn the TV off is a pain.***This next one is huge*** Coby TV's DO NOT accept universal remotes of any kind and trying to order another POS remote is impossible.  Just remember when the TV craps out on you that you only paid $350.00...my advice is pay the extra money and get a brand name.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "An Auto Programming Issue", "Author": "Jerry L. Brosius", "ReviewID": "R1DAMW5DIA6EG4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this TV/Monitor because I am half blind and our other TV/Monitor was a 19\".  For the money it was a good purchase. We had our cable turned on a few days ago and did an auto tune to tune channels in and well today, it did not work. It shuts the TV off and does not save the auto scanned settings. Now either we are doing something wrong or this TV's auto scan feature does not work.  Hmmmmm anyone have any ideas or has this happened to anyone else??????If we are just TV dumb and doing something wrong, please advise......otherwise...at least now I can see what's on TV, I just have to manually do channels each time.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Coby 26\" widescreen tv", "Author": "Michael H.
