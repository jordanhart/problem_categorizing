The shopping and selection process for this was long and hard, and the high end of our budget range certainly included some plasmas and flat panel LCDs near (but mostly above) the price of this TV.If you are a technology consumer, you know the deal: early adopters of LCD and plasmas are going to take a beating as prices for these fall. These technologies are not yet mature, and there are lingering issues, such as burn-in with plasma, and the sheer expense of LCDs. This set offers an excellent value for the size while the super thin formats settle in the marketplace.The picture is astonishing, and even more if you are lucky enough to live in an area served by HDTV. Even though not a true flat panel, it is only 15 inches deep and weighs less than 60 pounds. Getting it where you want to sit will probably take two people, but once there, it can be moved for cabling access easily by one person.It has more input options than most of us could ever afford to populate.Its user guide is complete and clearly written. I give only a B+ to some of the on-screen menu options; not all of them are immediately intuitive. This is a minor complaint for a TV that delivers every bit of the picture quality that the Sony enjoys a reputation for (going back to the days of \"a Sony of my owny...\"Terrific TV, Makes me never want to leave home:-)", "Date": "January 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Stunning picture, and it won't break the bank.", "Author": "Aram Vartian", "ReviewID": "RVCPRI16TKJ9A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had been shopping for a new television for the better part of three months, and had gone from plasma to LCD and back, before finally settling on the Sony 42\" Grand WEGA\u2122 HDTV projection LCD television. It is, hands down, the absolute best value for the money I could find.PICTURE CLARITYThe HDTV quality is simply amazing, even breathtaking. I have found myself watching 2-hour documentaries about the now defunct whaling industry in Croatia just for the fact that is was broadcast in HDTV. DVD quality is also quite good, and regular digital cable is also rather sharp (and while analog signals will be tolerable, they pale in comparison to the others). Video games are as crisp as they could be, and the television also works great as a secondary monitor (invest in a TV-out video card and a wireless keyboard/mouse, and your couch is now your new home office).LCD TVs still have some minor issues with either incredibly rapid movement and/or bright flashes of light. There is a small distortion; a pixilation that will briefly flash across the screen but it is at best a minor annoyance. Also, the blacks are not as black as they could/should be, so if you are watching a movie or program where the setting is very dark, there will be a slight glow around the black areas that can be a little annoying.The short of it is this; if you are in any way normal, you will be blown away by the clarity and intensity of the images this set can produce. If you are a TV snob (and you know who you are), and could rant for ten minutes about the red push, or how optical audio out only passes digital signals via the tuner, then you may have a few complaints. The rest of us will be quite happy.PICTURE CLAIRITY RUNDOWN:HDTV: Aside from the above mentioned black levels, flawless, crisp and shockingly bright.DVD: Good picture, though not quite as good as I expected. Animated/Digitally generated DVD (think Shrek) are nearly as good as HDTV. I suspect this has to do with the set being an LCD projector.Digital Cable: Average to good, depending on channel, but most fall within the good range (Note: This is based on Comcast digital cable service in Washington DC).Regular Cable: N/A (I don't have it, so I don't know)Video Games: Sharp, crisp, and oh-so big. Very Good. (Note: Based on a first gen Sony PS2)Computer Monitor: Another task that I suspected would be a major hassle that actually went off with little incident was adding a TV out video card to my PC and hooking it directly to my Sony. The picture and resolution are flawless, and with a wireless mouse and keyboard, my sofa has become an extension of my home office.SOUNDIts...well, its actually not too bad, to be honest. I expected it to be crap, and compared to any decent surround-sound system it does seem rather anemic, but all in all they are quite good, and the audio options are numerous. I sill suggest a decent surround sound system, but you can live without it.EASE OF USEI think out of everything, this surprised me the most. I had purchased a new all-in-one Sony surround sound/DVD player with the television, and had my digital/HDTV cable box delivered a day before. I now had the daunting task of trying to coble all of this together.I won't lie about this; I was scared. The TV I had before this one was a 27\" GE that I first purchased when I joined the Navy, and the only input it had was a singular hookup for coaxial cable.To my surprise (and everlasting gratitude) It was amazingly easy. Three cables is all that it took (four if you count the Playstation), and it worked like a charm the first time around. Also here are 8 video input channels for this television, so I can't imagine I would ever run out of room for more devices.One note on this: With a set this good, and assuming you plan to hook it up to a 5.1 surround sound system, it is going to cost you about 300 bucks for new wires and a decent surge protector. Factor that into your final cost for this big-ticket item.", "Date": "March 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great TV for half plasma price", "Author": "Czar Paul", "ReviewID": "R3SSBZAP1E7ZTZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Considering the price, this tv is a great value. I've been waiting for prices to come down and made the purchase soon after this model came out. There are multiple connections of all types including the cable card slot, which lets you get HDTV from your cable company without a set top box. The only drawback to this is that you don't get the program guide or any interactive features (program guide, PPV) with this feature. Hooked up to a HDTV signal, the picture is incredible. Football is super clear, and movies from HBO etc in HD also look great. Hook up a progressive scan DVD player and the picture is fantastic. The speakers are very good. Only drawback is that like any projection TV, there is an optimal viewing angle. You will notice a dimming of the picture as you move around.  When you see this TV, it's best to view it at an angle that you will be seeing it at home, even if that means looking silly in the showroom by crouching down when you look at it. Also be aware that you will have to replace the bulb on this type of tv as it ages.Added 2/08 To clarify my point about the picture dimming as you move, I really meant that you need to look at the TV at the correct height. The picture is much different if you stand higher than it rather that look at it direct on. I have not noticed a problem in the side to side viewing angle. Sorry for any confusion.

Cascio \"Professional Escapist\"", "ReviewID": "R22EUWV21NJEEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After dedicating a room in my basement for a home theater, I subsequently spent many, many weeks laboring over what TV was best for my application. I looked at every RPTV & Plasma that was carried by both Big-Chain & Custom A/V stores. You just can't find Plasma in this price range that is comparable in size, resolution and picture quality. That left DLP & LCD RPTVs. The Sony LCD RPTV line definitely was superior to any other brand out there, (thanks to Sony's WEGA engine). The price was fair at $2200. The picture quality is breathtaking on HD, excellent with DVD, and surprisingly acceptable on standard cable-TV.The TV is used primarily for watching DVDs.A word of caution to those with smaller rooms who are particular about picture quality...don't over buy (size). The downfall of fixed-resolution TVs (LCD, DLP) is the inability to adapt lower res. sources like DVD...not too noticeable unless you're seated close to the TV...like in my room. The viewing distance was only going to be 7-8 ft. at best with a 10ft. wide room. After standing the same distance away from the showroom TVs as my room affords me, I decided Sony delivered far and above the most impressive picture, despite the Professional Reviews I had read online. I also down graded from a 50in. to a 42in. This gave a slightly better viewing experience for the aforementioned reasons. I highly recommend taking advantage of the HDMI capabilities and purchasing an up-scaling HDMI DVD player. Both Sony & Panasonic have decent models for under $300. I went with the Sony DVP-NS975V. Once again, not great reviews, but astounding difference in the DVD picture quality. Combining this set with the right DVD player & sound system will give you a truly satisfying HT experience, without leaving you wondering where all your hard earned money went. The TV is bright, so you get a great picture with the lights on & off. Black level is acceptable; only notice the typical LCD/Black-level issues when the room is completely dark. I am not bothered by this.Bottom Line:Menu interface is intuitive.Picture presets are great and easy to customize, if needed.Sound is good, but if you're serious about the experience, you'll have an SS system.Picture quality is very impressive.Set dimensions are small, light and affordable compared to other LCD/DLP sets.Compared to other LCD/DLP sets, this is a 10. I gave it a nine overall because current fixed resolution TVs have inherent issues, (screen door/black-level,DLP-rainbow effect,etc.), that stop them from being perfect. But this one is pretty close.I just can't imagine anyone regretting the purchase of this set.", "Date": "June 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best Picture on the Market", "Author": "Ground Pounder \"Semper Fi\"", "ReviewID": "R2B68YFOUYUEYL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked at *many* televisions before buying this one.  While I was initially attracted to DLP projections (I am not impressed with the plasmas on the market), this Sony LCD projection caught my eye from all the way across the store.  It converts all signals to 720p, so you will see improvement even from standard (480i) signals.  With its built-in tuner, you'll be able to pull in HD signals as soon as you get home with only an antenna (the Zenith/Gemini ZHDTV1 is what I would recommend).  Having this television for the college bowl season was one of the happiest parts of my holiday, as I get all the local networks' digital broadcasts with my antenna (here's where 720p beats 1080i).  If you are a sports fan, you *need* an HDTV.There are numerous connections, including HDMI, and so far everything I have hooked up to this set looks amazing.  The settings menus are very easy to use, which is important since a little tweeking with the controls will ensure that each input performs at top quality.  One of the other reviewers suggested that the viewing angle is restrictive.  I could not disagree more: you basically have to be standing beside it or directly above for the picture to go dark.  I'd say the viewing angle is probably more than 150 degrees.In short, buy this set.  It is very affordable (less than half the price of a plasma the same size, with much better picture), has all of the bells and whistles (including a built-in HD tuner), and will look great in your living room.", "Date": "January 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Sony KDF-42WE655: Overall Great TV", "Author": "R.

The television in my living room was a 17 year old 36\" console televsion that had the tendancy to keep turning itself on and off after it had been on for over an hour.  I finally decided to break down and invest in a new quality television.  I first considered getting a plasma screen, but the based on the research I had done, I was not convinced that any added value a plasma screen may give you is worth the extremely higher price.  But this Sony WEGA LCD television is most definitely worth its price.Although not as narrow as a plasma screen television, at a mere 15\" in depth, even if space is a consideration, this television will not fail you.But it is the absolutely beautiful picture and incredibly crisp sound that are the true selling points for this TV.  The quality of the picture, even on the non-HDTV channels, is amazing.  I am still in awe of how much better the picture is now.  The quality of the HD channels absolutely blows me away.  While many shows on television aren't necessarily enhanced with HD programming (for instance, do you really need to see \"Judging Amy\" in pure digital, picture perfect quality?), but on certain programming such as sports or shows that have scenic backgrounds such as \"Lost,\" it is so amazing to see how beautiful they look on this television, I am probably too spoiled now to see them on any other television!I am also blown away with the stunning performance the television gives when playing DVDs.  I recommend getting the upgraded cables to connect your DVD player to the television.  But in any event, digital is what this TV was made for, and it is clear when playing DVDs.  Given the size of the screen and the quality of the picture, it is akin to actually being in the theater.The quality of the sound is also up to the standard you expect from Sony.  I do not yet have the television hooked up to any external speakers or any surround sound system, but instead rely only on the internal speakers.  Nonetheless, the sound is still perfect.  I am not a fan of watching of channels such as MTV, VH1, or the like, so cannot really speak as to how the sound system is on channels that are more sound reliant.  But you will not be disappointed with the sound on all the other channels.The added functions and features with the television are also quite impressive.  The picture-in-picture function is great, particularly if you like watching sports and can have a game on the smaller screen and watch regular programming on the main screen and click back and forth when something big happens in the game.  (I recently switched from cable to satellite -- a switch a highly recommend for everyone -- and have not figured out how, if at all, the picture-in-picture feature will work with satellite.)In short, I LOVE this television.

March 2009 I notice a blue haze at the bottom of the screen. After some research I discovered that  this is a very common problem and is essentially a flaw with the design that runs throughout the range of Sony Grand Wega sets;Specifically, failing optical blocks ultimately make the set unusable, due to artifacts of many different hues and sizes to appear on your screen.Repair runs to the order of $1000. I contacted Sony and thought that I would get this resolved as they admit that this problem is known and they indicate on their website page detailing the problem that they are resolute in their desire to maintain high quality, blah, blah etc.On my first point of contact I indicated that I did not want to foot the bill. The Sony service rep mumbled \" oh yes sir, I fully understand...\".. eh?I contacted a service center, and described the problem. I had to contact Sony again  to verify something so this time  I asked directly if  Sony would pay for it.The rep said the warranty had expired, and that the limited extended warranty that Sony put in place specifically to cover this *known* flaw had also expired, so the repair would be at my expense.Hmmm, so they know that they have a pandemic-sized problem that shows up only after a while for which they provide a limited window of support, then close up shop leaving many of their customers with junk too costly to repair.Even if you repair it, I understand that the design is such that the proximity of the lamp to the block is likely to again degrade the replacement part over time.Anyways, I indicated my displeasure to the rep, pointing out that the number of people being affected by this is fast approaching one that simply can't be ignored, and that I would be adding my voice and review-writing time to the clamor.In fairness to the poor, powerless guy on the phone, he did register my complaint, but I would be surprised if it will go anywhere.. if it does, then I'll repost here.So at this point I'm left with limited options other than to get loud enough for them to consider me a pest..I hate doing this because I have a life to live and work to do, and I really like to come away with  nice fuzzy feelings about customer service ( check out Oppo for a great electronics company that knows how to make you happy).Oh well.. off I go to cnet now...then maybe avsforum, and highdefforum.. oh the list is endless..", "Date": "March 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing HD Picture, lot of inputs, built in digital tuner..", "Author": "Manish Pandit", "ReviewID": "R3MCLGSZBTVZWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV in January from the local GoodGuys store. I needed a bigscreen without a lot of weight, and did not want to go with a plasma given the burnout concerns. LCD rear projection fit my budget and my apartment, and I am happy with my purchase. I did get the store warranty, just in case!I have limited basic comcast BUT was shocked to see the TV picking up HD channels right out of the cable! I do not have a comcast cable box but the built in digital tuner did the magic. So I am enjoying about 10 HD channels with no cable box to add to the clutter. Picture quality is amazing! There are lots of inputs. I have connected its audio to Onkyo HT770 home theater via an optical cable. I have also managed to connect my computer to the TV via S-Video, since the HDMi input didnt work great for me - I had to get a DVi-HDMi cable ($120) but still I could not get resolutions more than 640x480. I have given up on that. Other than that, DVDs are rendered in progressive @480p with my Sony DVD player. The quality is good enough for me, to not think about going with an upconverter.The only thing I do not like about it is the lag between turning it on and picture showing up (about 10 seconds). There were some postings on the internet about the lamp life, but I believe those were earlier models. Also, the remote does not allow switching to an input directly (It has 7 video inputs). If I have to reach Video IN #5, I have to browse all the way from Video1. Maybe I need to read the manual real closely.Overall, good bang for your buck and an excellent candidate for a Home Theater hookup. However, I never had good luck making an HTPC out of it.

We started reviewing sets about three years ago and found the technology immature, outlandishly priced and dealer information usually wrong. While DLP works well for video presentation projectors, you need a two or three chip set to do away with picture lag, and pictures look pixellated. Hitachi has already announced they are dropping DLP technology. Plasmas STILL suffer problems with burn-in even with picture-shift technology, they often die in 3 or 4 years, can be noisy especially above 4,000' altitude, and are fragile. Gas is gas and it leaks, degrades, has a half-life and despite urban legend gas in plasma tvs cannot be replaced. Dealers lie constantly--one told us that Plasmas now last 16 years!On to the Sony 42we655. Settling on Sony was a leap of faith. Our last experience with Sony equipment, an amp, was not a good one; quality control dropped since the 1970s when Sony was king and we had been buying Panasonic.  However, the built in featurs on this LCD TV especially the integrated NTSC and ATSC tuners and cable card slot cinched it. Prices vary wildly on the Net, but once you factor in shipping they all come out to about $2,100 to $2,500. The competing units are cheaper, but have no tuners,so add $300.We elected to buy it from Circuit City to avoid shipping costs and drop-kicks by shippers. CC is having financial difficulties, so we declined the extended CC-backed warranty in case they crater in competition with Best Buy.The unit took all of 20 mnutes to set up with no technical knowledge necessary. Don't let the CC delivery crew cable it to amps and DVDs because they don't know your equipment. Reading the manual first is a must because the unit is technologically advanced, but well worth it. Plan to spend several nights learning how to operate it and refining the adjustments. If you don't want to do this, turn it over to a spouse, geek friend or teenager.The picture quality is outstanding, and we get amazing HD signals with a set of rabbit ears in a rural area! Don't fret about the bulb, changing it is about 5 minutes work --no harder than an LCD projector bulb. A word about DVD connections, don't try to run a one-cable composite video feed from a DVD---spend the $40 and get component cables which give a much better picture. DVD quality differs wildly, so don't judge the set until you look at several different DVDs. Some writers have remarked about blacks. Yes, high CGI (computer graphic) special effects movies are dark, even in the theaters. CGI looks bad in sunlight which is why the movis are set at night. Video tape signals are amazingly bad because of the quality, so don't blame the set---just get rid of or transfer your old tapes and go to DVD.A great tv that you will enjoy exploring.", "Date": "February 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good Price, Great Quality", "Author": "J.

Standard definition programming is unremarkable, but HD content is spectacular.  I went with the 42\" because the larger screens aren't quite as bright considering that they all use the same high intensity bulb.  It's more screen to illuminate.  The 42\" screen was more than adequate.  Huge in fact.Even though I have the sound running through a six speaker Sony Dream home theater system, the TV's sound is very nice.

It is a small issue to some, but not me.As of 3 weeks ago, I started to see a couple of blue dots on the screen that were permanent.

It found over the air digital channels (some in HD) and all the inputs worked as advertised.The bad news is the standard definition image quality is a big disappointment compared to the trinitron tube I was used to! Maybe this won't be a surprise to others but it was to me. Even watching digital channels and using s-video or component inputs, the image is evidently not scaling up very well. This maybe has to do with the native resolution of the display (1386 x 788) and the way the image is scaled up. I'm guessing that SD images don't align with the native pixels no matter what the TV circuitry does. The pixels bleed noticeably and text edges are doubled when they should be crisp.Something else to get used to (really I can't decide if its worse or just different) is the 'glare' of this backlit set. The TV uses a bright lamp to back-light the LCD, and for images with light colors the glare can be hard on the eyes. This may be a matter of taste, but it is something to get used to.The one bright spot of hope is the digital HD image quality. Once tuned to a real HD digital signal, the TV begins to really shine. Even without an HD signal you can see the potential in the on-screen menus. Suddenly there are no scaling artifacts, the pixels are crisp and clear, and even the brightness and colors are more even and less eye-tiring. I dread going back to a non HD signal.So if you are upgrading step by step, be prepared for a new-found motivation to upgrade all available equipment to make sure you are in HD land as much as possible. Digital HD cable, DirectTV HD, and over the air digital HD are your friends.

For the longest time I was leaning towards a 34\" tube model. Then I found this set coming down in price at various web sites. I check it out in person in a few different stores and really liked the picture.I finally made the purchase in Mid August at a high-end TV store. Got it as a floor model at about $600 of list price. Could pass up the deal.At first I found the standard digital channels (on Comcast digital) were really not very clear. Then we ended up having an issue with the cable box and not getting channels. Comcast came by and found we had to many splitters coming off our main cable feed. (We have 2 digital cable boxes, 2 HDTV boxes and 1 line for broadband internet) The cable guy took away a few of the 2 way splitters and converted to 4 way splitters and also added an amplifier.Since then the non-HD channels are coming in much better. Still not quite as good as on the old TV or on the 34\" HD tube TV we have, but much better than it was.As for the HD channels themselves: When the broadcast is in HD, the picture is AWESOME! Especially Discovery HD, ESPN HD and all the NFL games broadcast in HD. I love this TV.The 42\" size is big, but not out of control. Right now we are watching from about 10' away.One of the things I like best is the picture in picture. It's a side by side picture. You can have both screen's the same size or make one bigger. I believe there are 3 or 4 different setting for size. Great when watching 2 NFL games on Sundays or you want to watch the football game and baseball game at the same time. When both screens are the same size, its like watching 2 20\" TV next to each other.DVD's are also great with this TV. I have the cable hooked up via the HDMI and the DVD with the composite video. Haven't watched a lot of DVD's yet, but with the few we have its been a great experience.This is now the centerpiece of my home theater system that consists of a Denon 6.1 digital receiver, Klispch front and center speakers, 4 Cambridge Sound-Works rear and side speakers, Panasonic DVD player and Sony VCR.No need to go to the movies again!Thank you Sony!", "Date": "September 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "SD \"SD\"", "ReviewID": "R30FY0O9UAL0FZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV!!

It had a crisp, brilliant picture and more than justified the cost.  Then blue blotches started to appear on the screen.  I checked the Sony service website, which said that that there would be extended coverage for problems with a blotchy picture, but only certain *kinds* of blotches.There are apparently two design defects with this unit.  The first defect has something to do with a defect in the LCD array itself, which caused picture elements to bleed into each other, and the second defect is that the sealing fails on the image box, allowing dust into the unit where it bonds with the LCD and creates a blotchy effect.The first defect (I'm told) is covered by Sony extended warranty.  The second is not.  After paying $100 for an \"evaluation\" which took less than a minute, we were told that the issue with our TV was not covered.  We were then given an estimate to fix the unit that was slightly more than the cost to replace it with a better TV.If I'm reading the Sony service notice correctly, the image box problems apply to all Sony Grand WEGA televisions, so I'd have to recommend that you avoid any of this line of TVs.What's more upsetting is Sony's refusal to own up to what is clearly a design defect in these units.  Anyone can make a mistake, but the real test of a company's ethics is how they deal with it, and Sony seems to have really dropped the ball on this one.We were early adopters of many Sony products -- the Beta video format, the Sony Discman, (I still have a D7 and it still works) the 8mm format, memory stick devices, the Sony XBR line of televisions, and Sony stereo components.  At $2,499, this TV was the biggest ticket item we have ever purchased from Sony, and they let us down.  Perhaps Sony is not the company they used to be.We are currently looking for a replacement TV, but we are not considering Sony, as it would be financially irresponsible to throw good money after bad.The other thing that bothers me is that this 18-month-old TV, being junk, not worth fixing, is destined to become landfill, along with countless other Sony Grand WEGA televisions that died long before expected, are not covered and cost more to fix than to replace.

I gave it a 4 out of 5 mainly because of the fact that the daytime viewing is NOT as clear and detailed as my other Sony; A 36XBR250 VEGA without HD. Actually, some of the standard displays on the older Sony are better than the LCD. I am probably going to get an upscaler to match the display to the best that it can do. As far as using the remote, I set all the inputs to video 5 and play them through my Denon 3803 receiver. I also have a Pioneer Elite laser, Panasonic DVD RP91 and a Pioneer 563A. I feel that the upscaler would take the place of much higher equipment. I can't wait for the NEW 1920 X 1024 displays which are coming in 3-4 years. By then, I will tire of the LCD and go with a plasma or projection. I DID get the warranty, as the price of the bulb is included and 1 thing wrong makes up the difference.

I am feeling defeated from having spent countless hours on the ever popular 'blue haze/cloud/dot reality nightmare show' of my Sony KDL-42WE655 Projection TV screen which I purchased on sale for $2400 in Oct 2004. In this instance, my once 4 year extended warranty which I had purchased through Best Buy as insurance against unforeseen potential major repair issues such as this expired last Oct. I am informed the optical block/engine is leaking and needs replaced at a cost of approx $1100 of which is only a temporary fix to an ongoing defective problem. Sony's Extended Warranty Service terminated Dec 2008 for a KNOWN manufacturer flaw which was apparently posted on their website and communicated in writing via letter to all owners potentially affected - I personally did NOT receive the letter and found that curious? I have had much discussion with various people in the electronics field, service techs and have read countless blogs. So I contacted Sony in hopes of getting it fixed beyond their warranty deadline. Well, I was reminded many times that the warranty period ended; however, I persisted further and spoke with a supervisor who offered me a hint of hope(with no further negotiation I'm told) is as follows:(a) Sony to pay $300 toward the repair only after I show proof via diagnostics from an authorized Sony Service Center which is 1/2 of the $300 already but can be applied toward the repair -OR- (b) Sony to give me a discount toward a new Sony TV - minimal it is and from a TV of their choice delivered to me by truck. This second option is not without a small catch attached as I must physically remove the serial number (tab) off the back of my current TV and send it to them to get the 'deal' and by doing so it would take my TV out-of-service obviously restricting me from getting it repaired on my own - well, I don't think so! I currently have no plans. I encourage any response to this matter from anyone having current knowledge, experience (positive or negative) and/or thoughts or suggestions on how or if I should proceed further. Their 1/4 offer of the cost of the repair just doesn't sit well with me and I think that is their aim to get me to bite the bullet. Truthfully, I am sick of it but there is a principal here and I have read about Sony being in Litigation regarding this very issue. So for now I am going to sit tight and keep my ears and eyes open. I believe there may be further recourse but not sure I want to hassle with it. Sony has marked my file and is awaiting a response from me - don't know of a timeline (if any) on this.Over the years I have purchased Sony TV's having been the best of the best. This experience has left me numb and when it comes to Sony expressing how they stand behind their products well, maybe in lip service! I want action and fairness and still want this matter resolved. TIMING is everything.. IF only I had received that letter.. IF the blue haze/cloud/dots on the screen had ONLY been more visable sooner.. guess I'm a little late, so they say. Timing, timing, timing.

By the number of complaints on this wega line-up its obvious that this t.v. is going to find the nearest landfill because a new set of this size will run less then fixing the old one. You would think a company as large as Sony would work with its customers but in this day and age of corporate greed, customer service is not a priority! I will never purchase anything with a Sony name on it again! Stay away from this line of television and for those who also own this set beware of the blue line,, its only a matter of time!", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredibly disappointed with the Sony KDF-42WE655", "Author": "The Baron \"TheBaron\"", "ReviewID": "R2YUAAMHBVY2RF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We've owned ours for a little more than 2 years and now the blue blob is spreading across the whole screen.

We felt safe buying a  SONY product!!!  I have looked at some of the reviews on this television, and I have noticed that many others have had this same problem with the blue dots, and ironically it is all around the same time period of having the television (2 years).

I loved this TV.  But now, after having it 2 1/2 years, it turned itself off and the red LED flashes in bursts of 7 times.  I found out that is a malfunctioning D board and is a common problem.  Scheduling the service with Sony has not been fun and they say the product is on backorder and don't know when it will be in.  I've found it on a website and am going to order it and hope I can get technician out.  But seriously, when you spend $2300 on a TV you should not have problems with it this soon.

But they said it's caused by dust on my optical block so they cannot replace it under warranty because its not scribble lines or roadmapping and it would run 1200.00 to replace.
