Roth \"film guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3E9GB109QIDFC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've now had the JVC-32p300 for about 3 months and have to say I'm pleased with the tv.  For starters I was also able to get it for around $450 from J&R; so check there first if you can't find a better deal.  And at that price I am very satisfied with what the tv has to offer.  I'll break this tv down into 5 categories for you prospective buyers out there that will hopefully help you in your decision of whether the JVC is right for you.Picture Quality: This television boasts a high def output of 1080p.  Although 1080p doesn't play much a factor in televisions under 50 inches it does have a nice ring to it.  The picture quality is good,  not great but by no means bad.  The TV is great for watching sports as I haven't noticed any motion blur.  The color comes through clear and with good contrast.  However, the black levels on this tv are not very good at all.  If you are someone that puts precedence on this aspect or watches a lot of lot of movies where this would be of importance (ie matrix) you may want to consider a different tv.  When watching the dark scenes in movies, the jvc might as well not even make an attempt at displaying a picture.  When watching a movie like say the 'Godfather', on a higher end tv you can make out the details of peoples faces in shadows as the director intended when shooting the film.  However the JVC doesn't even seem to make an attempt at displaying any black color detail.  This can be frustrating and I would have otherwise given this tv a perfect 5 star rating had it not been an issue.HDMI outputs:  This is quick but worthy of a category since the JVC is equipped with 3 HDMI outputs.  That is not often seen at this price level but is an excellent feature.  I hook up my ps3, mac and cable box to these hdmi ports and have found the picture and sound to work well with all 3.  There are also 4 picture settings you can choose from as your televisions display: Standard, dynamic, theatre and games.  All 4 can be further adjusted to your likings on an in depth scale.Ipod Dock: This has to be one of the most unique features which separates the JVC from the competition.  Its a really easy to use and cool feature that I find convenient when hosting company or working out.  The ipod dock hooks up to your ipod or iphone and allows you to play music from your artists, songs, playlists or music shuffle.  This is all controlled from your JVC remote and the best part is you can switch to tv mode and watch as your ipod continues to play your music.  Great combo for you sports fans out there that enjoy watching a game as your favorite music plays.The sound:  The sound quality is very good.  JVC is pretty well versed in the sound department so its no surprise they were able to deliver a television with solid sound quality.  This is another reason why the ipod dock is so great.  And I would say there isn't much need to hook up a home theatre if your not looking to spend the money.The look:  The TV looks damn sexy.  Its sleek with smooth edges and a rich glossy exterior.  It also has a stylish looking blue neon light that illuminates across the bottom of the television when turned on.  The blue neon light can also be turned off if you choose.Overall:  I would recommend this tv.  It has a lot of great features, delivers on value and does what I need it to do.  It would be nice if the tv had richer black levels but most tvs under $500 don't.  So if its not that big a deal to you than you will 100% love everything else the tv has to offer.  Hope this helps.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great tv for the money", "Author": "Tihomir Piskuliyski", "ReviewID": "RFQ7RK9JQZV4B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It works great, contrast is pretty good, sound quality is ok but nothing to write home about. The Ipod feature is a nice idea but the interface is horrible and you can't browse your playlists when a song is playing. However, it is one of the best low end tvs you will get for the price you pay. I got it for $450 down from $900. Def buy if you are looking for a 32\" bedroom or video games tv.", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "PERFECT!", "Author": "Dale R.
