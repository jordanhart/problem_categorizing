Delivered no problem in one week. It replaced an LG 55LH90.Here are my thoughts after a few days with it in no particular order. By the way, a little background on me....used to be REALLY into home theater, then I got married, so now I just enjoy it. I'm happy with the 80% solution. I have excellent vision and don't get motion sick or anything else like that. I do not like active shutter at all. It just irritates me, and the dimming and flickering I see when I move my head is a total deal breaker. YMMVAnyway:-it's freaking heavy. Also, it just seems huge compared to my 55\". FYI, I sit about 10 feet.-2d is very good. Surprisingly even good on SD content from Dish Network and older stuff on Netflix. Completely watchable.- 3d is fantastic. Tangled is WOW! Of course, good source material makes a world of difference. Green Hornet added nothing in 3d, whereas Tangled was actually a more enjoyable movie in 3d. It was like a different film. I haven't seen any 3d issues.-there is some flash lighting from the corners. I can tell a difference in blacks from my LH90 that had full local dimming backlight. (this does NOT have local dimming, unlike the 55 and 47 model 6500 listed in the table above. It's slightly annoying to me, but my wife doesn't even notice...also, I didn't point it out to her. Some things you just can't unsee. It improved as I adjusted the settings. The picture wizard is quite good.-the edge lighting is more viewable as you move to the opposite side. For example, if I sit left of center, the right side of the screen becomes \"less black\" because of that side's edge light. Vice versa- the magic remote is pretty nice, but not totally necessary..I wouldn't spend extra if it wasn't already included. There's not really any better way to explain it than comparing it to a Wii Remote. it also comes with another remote that has more buttons.  Neither is what I would call a universal remote.-the built in apps are cool. If you have a receiver with ARC, it's great to just click on Netflix, vudu, whatever and have the receiver switch over. The apps also work well. There are maybe 20apps or so? Netflix, Hulu, Amazon on demand (yes, watch the free stuff if you have Prime shipping), Pandora, Facebook, and some other ones that I don't recall.-PS3 and Xbox 360 with kinect work just fine through my Onkyo r360 receiver. PS3 played Tangled blu ray with zero issues. I even put Ratchet and Clank in 3d conversion mode and it was pretty cool.-speaking of, the 2d to 3d conversion is fun. It doesn't always work, but I'd say it's probably 85% right. I played Spongebob from Netflix and it got it mostly right, but there were times where his body, pants and legs were in the foreground, but his belt would be put in the background. Stuff like that. Generally, though, really cool.In all, I like it. If you are the kind of person who NEEDS the blackest blacks, don't get it. But, passive 3d, large screen and 3d conversion sold me vs some other sets.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV Set", "Author": "ringnjc", "ReviewID": "R34RCB7O1G9WXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Install:Just received the TV yesterday via freight shipping.  Package was in great shape and the delivery men wanted me to open the box and test the TV before they left.  This set is absolutely stunning even when it is off!  The great news is that it's even more amazing on.  It is fairly thin at less than 1\" and is a claimed 93lbs without the stand.  It seemed alot heavier, but it may just be the sheer size of the TV that makes the weight awkward to handle.  I mounted it with a super slim Sanus mount with the help of another person, of course, I'm no hulk!  I did not have an inset electrical outlet, so I had to buy one of those flat three prong extension cords in order to be able to get the TV close enough to the wall to snap in the bottom.  Since I mounted it above my fireplace mantle I got a tilting mount so that I could tilt the set downward since it sits about 5.5' above the ground.Features:I was most excited about the Cinema 3D so I will start there:-uses the same cheap glasses as in the theaters, which is great.-they are light weight and no worries if a kid breaks them, plus we have a collection of smaller glasses the kids get when going to see a 3D flick.-The 3D quality is bright, very dimensional, and does not give me a migraine like the active shutter sets do.  There is no flickering and dimming.-True 3D content from the HD satellite Receiver or blu-ray is just gorgeous.  better than the theaters as the screen is brighter.-2D to 3D actually works and adds dimension to almost any show you're watching.  It's fun to play with.-My overall opinion is that Cinema 3D is the new standard until we can all go sans glasses some day2D HD quality:I am no videophile, but the pure 2D HD quality is fantastic, and amazing considering this set is 65\".Colors are vibrant, blacks are deep, overall i am very pleased.Apps and Magic remote:-the Magic remote is very much like a Wii remote and really makes using the apps, web browser and other features a breeze.  you can also download the LG TV remote for your ios device and control the TV that way, worked really well.-There are the standard set of apps including netflix as well as other freebies and ones you can buy.  There is 256mb of built in storage, but with a limited amount of apps, and most coming in under 5mb, storage space won't be an issue, and you may be able to harness an extra USB stick, but I am not 100% sure.Wireless adaptor:I could not get the included wireless adapter to work with my d-Link wireless router, so I had to pull out my old trusty Linksys G router and the LG adapter recognized it right away.  I tried many security options, and wireless speeds to no avail on the d-link, which works with every other device in my house, PC, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Vizio TV, etc...Conclusion:For around $3000 I don't think you'll find a more desirable and feature rich set out there.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice, but not perfect", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2RHH5KF448W0A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice TV but it has some flaws.  Unfortunately all 3D televisions sold at this time have flaws so you have to pick your battles.  I was torn between the 65 inch Panasonic Plasma or this set as both are about the same price.  A friend bought a Panasonic GT30 series and has constant issues with burn in (real burn-in, not just IR) as the newest plasmas seem to have worse issues with that than the older 2009-2010 models.  Not sure why the newer (3D) plasmas have issues with IR and burn-in like early plasmas, but I'm a gamer and I didn't want to have to worry about burn-in.  I already knew that the picture wouldn't be quite as uniform and not to expect jet blacks so I wasn't surprised when I saw some light bleed at the edges of this set on a totally black scene or some very faint clouding on perfectly uniform scenes like a white background in a commercial.  Fortunately the mura and cloudiness are quite faint and are confined to the edges so they are not nearly as bad as the Sharp Aquos 65D64U 65 inch LCD it replaced.  Here's a rundown of the pros and cons that I've found in just a few days of ownership.Pros(1) Bright, sharp, very detailed picture.(2) No one in the family had issues with seeing lines in the passive 3D picture.(3) 3D picture is fantastic.  No headaches from wearing heavy active glasses.(4) Vertical offset not really an issue at typical viewing distances, even with wall mounting.(5) Good smart TV apps, but I don't use those much.(6) Off angle (side) viewing is excellent: very little contrast/color shift.(7) Massive array of settings/features: could be a \"con\" too as you can get lost in them!(8) Nice sturdy base has left/right swivel.(9) Tru Motion option is incredible: can smooth out any slow-frame-rate source.Cons(1) ~150ms lag w/default settings, see [...](2) Can't use optical audio out on TV to sync sound because it only passes stereo sound.(3) Blacks are not plasma black obviously, but not bad for an LCD.(4) Some mura and light bleeding but improved by massaging screen stress points w/cloth.(5) Incredibly annoying idiot warning w/3D content: can't be disabled.(6) Glossy screen shows every reflection: reflections can ruin the 3D effect.Summary: overall I'm quite happy with this set.  The passive 3D is better than I expected and comparable to my friend's Panasonic GT30 plasma in quality.  Half-res 3D due to the passive technology doesn't seem to be a factor beyond about 8 feet.  And no one should buy an LCD expecting perfectly uniform picture and jet blacks like a plasma.  So from what I was expecting, I'm quite impressed.  This set lost one star in my review for two primary reasons: the set can't pass proper DD 5.1 sound from HDMI input to optical out, and because of the idiotic warning that pops up every time you go from 2D to 3D mode.  LG needs to add a way to acknowledge that warning once and then not display it in the future.Mike", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "One of the greatest 3D LEDs out there.", "Author": "Axewhole", "ReviewID": "R3E68K3WYSWTBZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to start this review by stating that I did some basic research based on the HZ on LED/LCD TVs.  I began my research wanting a good 3D LED set as well, that I would have for many years.  Originally, I was looking at the 55\" Infinia 240 Hz version, because we all know that 240 is bigger than 120 and that must mean it's better.  I was about to cash all my chips in, until I realized the necessity of confirming my transaction with my wife, in clearer detail.  Sometimes I need to fill her in with more detail than necessary, just to be sure everything is cleared up.  Literally a few hours later, the 55\" went up by 500 bucks, and I was rather devastated.  Yes, had I purchased it based on my gut instinct, I would have surely had the 55\" at the low price it was.  At this point, I didn't see a reason in getting the 55\" 240 Hz anymore, so I decided to do a little more research on the 240 vs. 120 thing.I decided that before I purchased this set, I needed to be sure it wasn't based on \"just settling\" for what some might see as \"second best\".  There is a 55\" 120 HZ version of the same exact TV for a lower price, however at this point, I needed to have what I felt was the best out there for me in the market.After educating myself on the 120 HZ vs. 240 HZ, I concluded that one would have to be a robot or a super natural human being to notice the difference between the clarity of the two.  In other words, to what I read, I concluded that the human eye cannot tell the difference between a 120 Hz and a 240 Hz, but definitely a difference in a 60 Hz.  I then concluded that I did need the extra 10 inches of viewing for myself and self gratification.  Learning from my previous error, I immediately purchased this 65\" and then I confirmed the details with my beloved wife.  Not to my surprise, she wasn't disturbed by my decision making, since Amazon has a great 30 day return policy.  Am I happily married? You betcha bub.When I was receiving this behemoth of an LED, the shipper was supposed to have two people deliver it to us, however there was only one individual and I was at work, while my wife was at home.  Guess who became the second person to bring this thing up to our apartment?  I'm just glad my wife loves me.  Word of advice; please confirm that there will be two delivery people coming over to your place to get this thing in; it does weigh a lot and you'll feel guilty if you let your wife help out while you're at work. Aside, the fact that the shipper had notes to have two people deliver this thing, there was only one.  Luckily my wife's from Russia, and she's been through worse.Upon arriving home from work, I do admit I felt like a kid on Christmas morning.  The look on my wife's face was priceless.  \"Do you really need such a big TV\"?  Answer: Yes.  \"Okay\"?  Unpacking it was pretty easy.  All you need to do it cut the plastic belt holders and the box just slips out, by pulling up!  That's pretty genius.  This unpacking feature is probably pretty normal for many huge size LEDs, but I've never had an LED before, especially at this massive size.Considering that this set is 65\", it's not as heavy as it probably should be and that's a plus for me.  Mounting this set on a stand was a breeze.  There are only four screws in the back, and they're definitely not going anywhere if you hang this thing on a stand.  On the wall is probably a different story altogether, but as far as a stand, it's a \"set it, forget it\" kind of thing.  I hung this beast on a Walker Edison 60\" Regal 4-in-1 TV Stand w. Mount - Wood.After mounting, I then plugged in the WiFi dongle, and setup the internet.  Once that was done, I wanted to check out Netflix and Amazon Streaming.  Both of those features work very well.  Looking at HD movies on this set look amazing, even on default settings. I did however fool around with the settings, and this is what I am currently using. (this was based on some settings someone else put in, and aren't my own).Backlight: 60Contrast: 89Brightness: 51H. Sharpness: 50V.

Not to mention, 3D movies look amazing too.  It's freakin' sweet.  I do enjoy the fact that I can take the real 3D passive glasses from the movie theatre and use it at MY very own theatre at home.  In a way, replacing the glasses for these are kind of like having an unlimited amount, if you get a pair from the movies.  Is it stealing?  I don't think so, since the movie theatre does charge you for the glasses.  Just saying.I'm not here to argue with the creed of passive 3D vs shutter 3D.  I believe when purchasing any 3D capable LED/TV/LCD/PLASMA/, you as a buyer need to decide on what best fits your liking.  To me, this TV does exactly what I need.  I also like the fact that if you need to purchase replacement glasses for this LED, it's roughly 10 dollars a pair.  If you do purchase this TV, the unit does come with four pairs of 3D glasses, however the colors are almost a mockery.  It's like \"hey, they're free!  Sure, they're like bright yellow, loud orange and obnoxious white, but they're free!\"  Personally, I don't care about the colors.  I don't watch TV as a fashion statement.  I'm not going to the grocery store, while I know I could and that would be interesting.  I'm going to be at home and hey, the glasses DO their job; they work!I really do like this TV.  It feels like I have more than just a TV.  It's like having an extra computer.  I tend to connect an external hard drive to watch videos.  It works really well.  LG has its own app store, but I haven't purchased anything from it.  I know it is capable of browsing, going on facebook, as well as skype calling, but that's why I have a computer for.  One could say that the extra features are just icing on the cake, and I would totally agree with that statement.  It comes with two remotes.  One is your traditional remote, and the other one resembles a Wii Remote, or it's a remote that says \"hey look what I can do!! Yeah, I'm an awesome TV; I know\".  I tend to use the traditional remote more often than the Wii-like remote, since it's sensible, although the innovative remote is useful for entering in name titles on Netflix and other like programs.I recommend this TV for the obsessed movie goer, as well as the casual TV watcher.  It's an excellent set.  It has everything you wanted, needed and everything else you didn't know you needed.  I made my decision knowing I wanted an LG Infinia.  Knowing what I know now, I am actually glad I didn't get the 55\" 240 Hz.  If you base your decision- making solely on the technical aspect, you might want to reevaluate the differences between 120 Hz vs. 240 Hz, before purchasing.  If you're still convinced that it's all about technical view points then you've made your decision already and everyone wins. :)I really enjoy going to the movies, and this set gives me that feeling.  I can watch movies in crystal clear, no blur HD quality, and if I feel like it, I can watch anything in 3D.  That's a plus for me.Update:  One thing I hate with a passion is the YouTube app.  It's horrible.  When you start it up, it randomly plays whatever video it wants to.  Then you spend more time searching for a video than you would watching it.  YouTube needs to get on this and make an actual interface for their app.  It begs to have a history cache of previously watched videos as well as a sign in feature.  Hopefully there will be updates for this app.  Stand-alone, it's horrible and I'm not really one to complain about apps and little bits of that nature.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent", "Author": "J. Leigh \"JL\"", "ReviewID": "RKIKD2C4I9LPA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:- Stereo interleaved lines are not noticeable for most 3D content and especially when seated at the recommended distance.- Gyroscopic controller does make it easier to deal with menu selections.- As with all micropolarized stereoscopic screens, side-ways off-axis viewing is excellent. Vertical offset will yield ghosting. But for normal viewing use this is unlikely to impact anyone.- For the price it is an excellent display- especially since you are using the same polarized glasses as in the movie theaters.- 2D image quality appears to be on par with other 65\" LCDs I have from Sharp. The only difference is that the screen is glossy because of the micropolarization overlay.Cons:- When you plug a laptop into it, there is noticeable lag. For example, when you move the mouse on the laptop there is a small lag to when the screen is refreshed. This is perhaps to be expected with most modern TVs that do so much internal processing. I am using it as my wall mounted monitor in my office so the lag is a bit annoying- especially for someone who's primary business is computer graphics. To reduce the lag you can either plug in via the VGA connector or by turning down as much image processing as possible. If you do a search on AVS forum you'll find suggestions on how to do that.Update: it turns out, even if you use the HDMI input, you will dramatically reduce the lag if you go into the input labeling option and relabel it as PC. I guess the TV is trying to be intelligent.- There is some  inconsistencies in the backlight, but this is pretty good for a 65\" screen, especially when compared to screens with florescent back lights. Of course it is not as crisp as a plasma display. But then again it is also much lighter than a plasma screen, and you don't have to buy the heavy 3D glasses.- The support stand it comes with is incredibly wobbly- it is essentially a cheap piece of plastic that is about 3 inches across on each side. This tiny hollow neck is supposed to support and balance the weight of the entire LCD screen. A Bobble Head comes to mind. Except the head is the big LCD screen- scary!  Get a wall mount.Normally for large ticket displays I order them from local vendors so it's easy to return. I had to order this from Amazon since the local vendors only had them on pre-order. The shipping company banged up the unit pretty badly. The top portion of the box was compromised when I received it. And the plastic frame around the display was dented. I took a picture just in case the unit didn't work.  Surprisingly the screen was not cracked and the display functioned fine. Normally this degree of impact will crack a display.

The TV is so large it's like being at the theater and the passive glasses have no batteries or charging so it's cheap and I can't tell any difference between those and active!  I've played Crysis 2 on the TV and loved it.  I also played 3d movies like \"Resident Evil\" and \"How to train your dragon\" on demand from Comcast - all incredibly smooth... Beautiful landscapes, stunning 3d, incredible functionality and I can't wait to combine it with Xbox Kinect!  By the way, I am currently as I type this watching X Games on ESPN in 3D and OMG!  Fantastic!  Absolutely incredible - you have no idea what your missing.Couple setup hints... Turn off Tru Motion when you watch movies. It introduces a video camera feel to films - you'll notice this in movies like \"Inception\".  And... if the tv goes dark periodically by itself, it may be that you have the \"Energy Saving mode\" or the \"Intelligent Sensor\" enabled, in this case, go to your home menu go to picture settings then locate any Energy saving or Intelligent sensor and turn it off and that should take care of your issue.Hope that helps everyone!

All three do exceptionally well on this television.  If you experience any type of gaming lag on this television you need to make sure your picture setting is set to game mode, and change your input label to either game or PC.  PC is best as it allows for less lag.

First of all, you cannot beat the passive 3D TV system.  I am using 3D glasses that were given to me by relatives who brought them home from the movie theaters. Yes, that's correct...the REAL D glasses from the theater function in an identical manner to the 4 pairs of glasses that are included with this TV set.The picture is outstanding in 2D and in 3D.  If there is any truth at all to the claims that the passive 3D systems do not give full 1080P in 3D mode, I certainly cannot tell.  The 3D viewing angle is superb too...you can watch fairly well even 45 degrees out from center.  Angle, distance, and even height changes still allow for good 3D viewing.My only (very minor) complaint is that if you try to use the electronic buttons on the front of the TV (instead of the remote), they are difficult to actuate.  Also, this unit could really benefit from the use of a wireless keyboard while using the built-in web browser (connecting a USB keyboard will not work either).

I don't see any lines like the active shudder glass set makers would have you believe and we sit about 9 feet from the screen. I bought Final Destination 4 in 3D blu ray to try out on my LG BD670 player. AWESOME!!!  What an incredible experience! The 3D from DirecTV is very good as well depending on the programming.  Setting up the wireless adapter was a breeze, as the setup screen walked you through the steps needed and when I pressed the connect button on my Linksys router it found it right away and asked if I wanted to update my software. This was completed and the apps loaded flawlessly.  In summary, if you are on the fence about this set, the 2D picture is amazing, 3D is incredible, just take the plunge, you WILL not regret this at all. I can't wait for football!!UPDATE on 10/24/11. The past two weeks I have had 2 separate software updates that have come up when the TV is first powered up. It say's there is a software update available and would I like to download and install it? Clicked yes, the download and update are installed and the set resets itself automatically. Also, and this is HUGE, after burning in the set for two months, the picture is better then ever, I am TOTALLY impressed with this set....", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3D, disappointing light leakage/clouding effect", "Author": "Mackie", "ReviewID": "R1WI9SXWOJ1E2B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really, really wanted to like this TV, but it has some serious faults.First the good:3D is amazing. Passive 3D is the most comfortable, bright, and attractive option out there. I have owned Active 3D sets in the past, and this is truly the future.  I did not notice any scan lines, or distracting artifacts when watching 3D as some have noted.  The colors truly do pop, it's a fantastic set for kids and a large group of people to enjoy 3D.2D...It's a roller coaster ride, plain and simple. Biggest fault is the light leakage, the drawback of an edge lit LED television.  It didn't bother me at first, but after a week, I'm sending it back.  All four corners leak light in black scenes, and on my TV, white 'clouds' of light poked through the middle of the set.  It's a rollercoaster because, when the movie/game is actually playing, you don't notice it behind the image.  The image is very, very good, in these times.  But when playing a letterbox movie, or navigating a black screened menu, it rears it's head, and it's truly ugly.Another aside is the off angle viewing. I've noticed that if you're not sitting directly in front of the TV, the light spillage is more apparent coming from the opposite side.I didn't expect inky blacks, but the light spillage was something that truly turned me off, and got in the way of enjoyable letterbox movie watching.However, other than the light leakage, I found the colors to be very good, the settings very good, and the image was plenty bright.  The glossy screen did not factor in at all, just don't have a light source behind the couch where you're sitting and you won't notice anything.Second fault, game playing.  Plain and simple, I cannot play Modern Warfare 3 at the same level that I could play it on a Plasma. Even when setting the input to PC, which reduces the lag noticeably, it was still never as responsive as a plasma would be. However, when you set the input to PC, the picture quality drops slightly.  I was a little disappointed to find out the excellent contrasty picture I had spent fifteen minutes setting up would noticably wash out when I enabled PC mode to my input.  Something for you games to consider with this TV.In summary:1. 3D is amazing, the best I've seen.2. 2D is very good.3. Light leakage is very bad, clouding is apparent in black backgrounds.4. Lag can be tweaked to be good, at the cost of picture performance.If all you do is watch 1.66/1 films and 3D, get this TV. Nothing compares.  If you watch letterboxed movies and play video games on a regular basis, I would advise a plasma display.UPDATE: Paul's TV does NOT take back non defective TV's without a 15% restocking fee, and a $100 delivery charge.  Buyer beware when using them!UPDATE2: The 'white clouds' disappeared when I took the provide lint free cloth and gently massaged the screen, apparently it occurs when the screen presses against the backlight during shipping. It is funny that the people at LG or Paul's TV never recommended this simple solution.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "This TV is a BEAST", "Author": "Doylezor", "ReviewID": "RNYGLBFNOM64D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Where to begin...First off let me open up with the fact that I do a lot with my TV. I watch blurays, DVDs, stream, have a digital HD cable and own virtually every relevant video game system known to man. I also live in a pretty small apartment. I am going to share some things that I looked for when researching this TV that I couldn't find adequate answers for. There are a lot of reviews out there for this device, not many of them had the details I was looking for. Details, it's all in the details.In no particular order:* If you are wondering - yes the screen is made of glass. It's framed in black plastic, the bevel is raised. This is a small departure from the clean sheet of older models. This makes a difference when cleaning your display. No big deal. I use regular Windex sparingly, sprayed on a microfiber rag, not the TV.This is also part of the reason why it's relatively heavy. (~90lbs w/o a stand)* Yes the screen is glossy. If you have a problem with that I'd suggest you figure out your lighting scheme because if you think it reflects too much light, you have failed to properly control the lighting in your viewing area, something that you should do if you have a TV of this caliber and understand how to get a good picture out of it. Indirect lighting. Work it out.* Wear gloves, preferably leather if you are moving this TV any real distance. The edge is not sharp but the weight of the TV will dig into your hands and carrying it will be painful, you don't want to drop this bad boy.* Viewing distance - This was huge for me as I sit on the closer side to this thing and I couldn't find definitive numbers so here they are, courtesy of my fat max tape measure. The distance at which you can start to see horizontal lines of separation when using 3D mode at 1080p res is 6.5 feet. At 5 feet you loose the 3D effect and can no longer get an image with depth. I sit with my eyes 8.5-9 feet from the screen. It looks perfectly fine. Any distance beyond 6.5 feet is good. Remember that's at 1080. When viewing media at a lesser res, you need more distance. I'm an HD snob so aside from a round of Tetrisphere on my N64 or some OG 8bit Zelda all of course look like hell on this TV when sitting this close. Be reasonable with your expectations or learn to squint really really hard.* The 3D - I've spent time behind active glasses, movie theater glasses, and now LG's version of passive. Let there be no mistake. LG has nailed it. This is the same exact cinema experience you get at a theater. It's well done and renders a flicker-less, bright, rich 3D performance. It does process 2D to 3D incredibly well - unfortunately not perfect. There are flaws of course, occasionally objects are misplaced in the field of depth. Also viewing from the extreme sides of the display washes out into white. Flaws aside - because this set basically unlocks anything you see into 3D makes it worth it. Here are some details:  * MW3 Looks amazing. The 3D does work well here, however if you are hardcore the small amount of input lag will annoy you, also with so much fast yaw and pitch movement it's tiring on the eyes. Great eye candy, harsh for grinding.  * Tiger Woods '10 honestly, doesn't add too much. Having a club swing towards your face is amusing but as for the rest of it, kind of meh.  * Zen Pinball FX2 is a love hate thing. Here there are issues. I absolutely love this video pin, some tables are great. Epic Quest looks amazing. In fact all the tables look amazing, however some have issues with the play field. Some have elements that are below the play field, such as jets and bumpers that appear to be under the where the ball rolls around making it a head trip. On the tables it does work on, look phenomenal.  * Skyrim looks great. Suffers some of the issues of MW3 but lag is a lot less of an issue here.  * I LOVE Fringe. I love it more in 3D, it looks great.  * Made for 3D media (3D- Bluray) looks the best. Do your eyes a favor and pick up an IMAX 3D bluray in what ever flavor your like, nature, space etc. You're in for a real treat.* I had no issues connecting the wifi to my net gear router. The wifi adapter provided with the purchase does work with the n band if you have a capable router.As far as the rest of the features on the TV. The streaming apps are decent, what one would expect from any internet enabled device with streaming apps. I didn't care for the wanna be wii remote. For me the cursor was juttery and flaky on the screen when trying to point it, in as long as it took me to chuckle I tossed it into a drawer. The standard remote works fine enough for me. I've read people comment in other reviews about a lack of universal remote and decent sound. If these are the types of concerns you have when buying a $2500+ TV do the world a favor and go jump off a cliff. You're buying this TV for what you see not what you hear. I can't even tell you what it sounds like because the first thing I did after power up was turn the speakers off. If you have the cash for this TV you have the coin to drop on a decent stereo. If not, you just put a Ferrari body on a Ford Pinto and are frankly an idiot. As far as the remote goes. If having a universal remote is the only thing that brings you a peaceful night of sleep, suck it up and nab yourself a Sony tablet. It has a IR com built in with a robust universal control app too. Ya it's twice the price of a harmony, but it's 10 times the remote, it's a touchscreen android tablet and it makes the harmony look like a child's toy. Yes there is \"clouding\" on this panel, it's common with displays this large. Grab yourself a nice microfiber cloth and spend a few minutes massaging the screen and you'll find you can pull a good deal of it out. No this TV isn't 240htz but frankly, it wouldn't make much of a difference other than tacking on another $600-800 to the price tag. Remember this a 65\" TV and it costs easily under 3k, what do you expect? Don't be mad at LG for not knowing either, if anyone has bothered to read their own website's message boards you'll see they don't seem to know about 1/2 of what this TV can do or can't, by virtue of the fact 90% of their responses to questions is a canned answer that's as vague as a drunk Bob Dylan singing to himself in the bathroom. That doesn't mean it's a bad display. I apologize if my review insults anyone, but you have to be fair when examining a product and its intended use. This is a TV, not an all in one media mega master device, it doesn't make toast well and it won't clean up after your dog. At the price point it's currently being sold for (~$2500) you can't do better right now.I will finish it off with this: For the value you can't beat this TV with anything else on the market right now for an LED TV of this size with 3D features this good.=====I have more media and games to try. I will add them in a update later.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Extremely pleased with this LG 65\"", "Author": "RS \"RSCPA\"", "ReviewID": "RD9DD9EEWUFV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for a few days now. I ordered from Amazon and opted for the standard delivery instead of the scheduled delivery during checkout. The difference between standard delivery and scheduled delivery is that scheduled delivery allows you to schedule a specific date to have the TV delivered to you during checkout, usually in about two weeks at the earliest, whereas standard delivery means that Amazon quickly ships the TV to the delivery company's warehouse and then the delivery company calls you to schedule a delivery date and time.The delivery of the TV to my house was great. They delivered the TV on time(I had a four hour window from 1pm to 5pm and they arrived at 2:30), opened the box, put the little stand on the TV, put the batteries in the two TV remotes(one remote is a \"wand\" type remote like the Nintendo Wii uses), and then they lifted the TV and put it on the TV table that we bought. Then, they plugged the TV into an outlet and turned it on to see that the screen was not cracked anywhere and to see that it worked. They DID NOT hook up anything to the TV like our sattelite box or the DVD player, which is what I expected from them. They only deliver it, open the box, attach the stand, put it on a table and plug it in. Done.The TV was very easy to set up. The picture can be adjusted to your liking with a huge selection of different picture setting combinations to choose from. I use the \"Standard\" setting from the menu and then I tweek that a little to get the picture I like(it's very easy to work with the menu settings). The TV also has a very easy to use Picture Wizard that will walk you through setting up the picture for you if you choose to use that. You can always change the settings back to whatever you like if you don't like the Wizard's results. This TV is quite easy to set up and very intuitive IMO.I also connected a sound bar to this LG and it sits in front of it......Fantastic! The speakers that are on the TV are what you'd expect on any thin LED TV. They're definitely ok for hearing the programs, but if you're into those realistic and very loud sub-woofer driven movie sounds you get like in a theatre then you'll want to add your own sound system to this TV at some point imo.A few folks here reviewing this TV are complaining about the glossy screen wishing it was matte instead. Maybe they're seeing something here that I'm completely missing. I know I'm pretty picky, but I really like this glossy screen and how it looks. This TV produces an outstandingly beautiful picture. I've looked at a lot of TVs at both Costco and Best Buy before buying this LG 65LW6500 and I don't know how you could get a picture that's any better than what this thing produces. Maybe a matte finish would make it that much better, I just don't know.Setting up the internet connection was very simple. First, plug in the wireless dongle(the dongle comes with the TV and is located somewhere in the box with the remotes) into any one of the USB ports on the back of the TV. Then, use the remote control by pushing the \"Home\" button. Next, highlight the \"Settings\" box and press enter. Then, move down the setting's list of items until you get to \"Network\" and push enter. Now, choose \"Wireless\". Next, press the Navigation buttons to select \"Setting from the AP list\" and press ENTER. Now, press the Navigation buttons to select your wireless router which will be showing on the list. (If your router is secured, you will be prompted for the key/password.) type your password and press ENTER. Done. You're connected to the internet.After you connect to the internet, the TV will automatically want to upgrade its Firmware/software. This is IMPORTANT! Go ahead and let it do the Firmware upgrade. If it doesn't try to start the firmware upgrade process automatically, then do it manually as follows:1 Press Home to access the Home menu.2 Press the Navigation buttons to scroll toSETUP and press ENTER.3 Press the Navigation buttons to scroll toSUPPORT and press ENTER.4 Press the Navigation buttons to scroll toSoftware Update and press ENTER.The current firmware version displays.5 Select Check Update Version to check a newfirmware version manually.6 When the update is complete, the TV willautomatically restart in 5 seconds.The TV comes with TWO remotes. One is the regular looking remote with a lot of buttons, the other is the wand type remote that works just like a Nintendo Wii remote with much fewer buttons than the regular remote. I like them both. The wand is actually easier to use when setting up the tv and when using the TVs Smart TV and internet functions because all you do is point the wand at the TV and mash the button on the remote at which time a little cursor pops up on the TV screen. All you do then is move the cursor around the TV screen by aiming the wand and pointing it at the item you want to select on the TV screen, and then you push the wand button to select it.I'm not a big 3D fan, but I got the LG 3D Bundle which was included free with this TV. The Bundle includes an extra six pair of 3D glasses shipped seperately to you by Amazon( another four pair come with the TV in the box) making a total 10 pair of glasses.3D is extremely nice on this TV if you have 3D programming to watch. I have DirecTV which has a few 3D channels. The 3D is beautiful depending on the type of program you're watching.The \"2D to 3D\", which converts 2D programs to 3D, also works fairly well. It's not quite as nice as watching an actual 3D program filmed in 3D, but it can and does work very well depending on the show you're watching. I watched some NFL football this weekend and 2D to 3D was pretty cool for the game.I also bought the 5 Year LG Extended Warranty which is sold here at Amazon for $209. I think that's a real bargain for a 5 year \"come-to-your-home\" warranty on a $2400 TV.I know LG makes an excellent TV and they rank among the highest in ratings for their LED 3D TVs in the Consumer Reports website which I subscribe to.I'll let you know in future updates to this post if anything goes crazy on this puppy, but for now, this TV is an easy 5 star in my book.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Infinia Cinema 65W6500 - LG Love this Great 3D TV", "Author": "JD", "ReviewID": "R2WQX0HYMBOEM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I need to first mention I always liked 3D, even when I was very young and viewed 3D with those old red/green glasses at the movie theater. The 3D today is far superior. I even started purchasing our favorite blu-ray movies in 3D before we had the 3D TV. Blu-ray movies originally filmed in 3D provide the best 3D quality... viewing with this TV is pure enjoyment!Fortunately, My wife and I both like 3D and the same kind of sci-fi, horror and action movies. We researched 3D TV's for several months before deciding on this LG 65\" Infinia Cinema Smart TV. This model is a passive type 3D HDTV with a specially designed TV Screen. The LG glasses are similar, but better than the 3D glasses at the movie theater.We chose the LG 65LW6500 for several reasons. The picture quality is great in HD and 3D and very good with regular DVD 2D TV. There is no 'ghosting\" double lines, flicker, narrow viewing width, or eye sight problems like with an Active Shutter 3D TV. Active Shutter 3D does bother my wife's eyes.The HD picture on the fifteen 3D Blu-ray's we have watched look better than the ones we first saw in 3D movies at the Movie Theater. Color, Brightness, Sharpness and Picture Detail is wonderful. The picture is brighter and sharper than the 55\" Sony HDTV we have. The Samsung 40\" LED TV has more vivid color but this is not really a fair comparison since the Samsung model has a smaller screen and a better LED backlighting system. Both are also not 3D. The LG 65LW6500 can stream subscriber internet TV channels like Instant Netflix and free channels like Crackle among other features.The LG can also make a simulated 2D to 3D picture from any source so we rarely watch any movies in 2D anymore. It's just more exciting and enjoyable in 3D. The larger screen size can make you forget you are watching a TV and puts you in the action. My wife says viewing scenery or nature scenes are so natural and clear that it is like looking out of a window.I should also mention that the \"White Glove\" Delivery from this Amazon Prime purchase was excellent. It arrived in only a few days and was unpacked, inspected, and checked to insure the TV was in satisfactory working condition before they left. The TV was delivered one month ago.The only things we have found is the same as others have mentioned about the brighter edges and black screens but we only notice this with ending credits of a movie. The screen is reflective so a darker room provides the best viewing experience.If you are connecting the TV to a non-3D Ready Surround Sound System you might also want to consider purchasing a 3D Blu-ray Player that has dual HDMI outputs like the Panasonic DMP-BDT310 to enable DTS Master Audio or Dolby True HD from your non-3D HD Audio Surround Sound Receiver. A 3D Certified HDMI Cable may also be needed.Hopefully our experience has helped with your purchase of a 3D TV.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "NO service from LG ,Thank Goodness for Amazon", "Author": "Jack  M.", "ReviewID": "R19XGVR52KPT9S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After about 3 weeks I noticed a cloud like effect bleeding through on dark scenes.I tried to contact LG service.

I solved this problem by setting up my room lighting so that it does not show reflections.  A non glare screen like the one on the 55\" version of this tv would be better.  The fact that the 3D glasses are passive is also a plus.  You can buy 10 pairs of passive glasses for the price of one pair of active glasses and there are no batteries to recharge or replace.

First the bad... There is none. Period. I simply can't find any fault with this set. Nada. Nothing.Now the good. This is 65\" of LED-LCD tv. Did I mention 65\"? This thing is huge. There has recently been non-projector sets to come out this year larger than this, but not in 3D. Plus, for those slightly larger sets you are paying double the price.Next. Passive TV is it and it is in. This is the same technology used in the theaters. Don't fall for the active technology of yesteryear, passive IS the way to go. I looked at active sets. There is ghosting, crosstalk, terrible... just terrible. Plus active TV's use those $100 glasses, have to recharge batteries, have to sync them up, and cause headaches. Try waving your hand back and forth as fast as you can in front of one eye. Well there you have it, thats active \"shutter\" technology. The only thing you'll get from that is nausea or headaches. Plus, with passive technology if you want extra pairs of glasses then take them home from the movie theater. They work perfectly, and currently I have a collection of 20 pairs. I can have a whole family reunion watching the Superbowl in 3D at no extra cost per glasses to myself.I don't even want to hear it from the active folks. \"You are losing resolution, it's not true 1080P HD\". If you read up on it, the smart folks at LG have updated their firmware to a new algorithm which displays 4 separate images per frame to give you the true HD. This update eliminated any previous passive crosstalk, ghosting and lost resolution. Case closed. Active TV no longer has a \"1UP\" on passive.Next with the TV set. I altered the color settings out of the box to make it all really \"pop\". I mean it looks real good. The APPS are just fine, internet connectivity is easy and simple and it has just about any connection you need to hook up to it. I have really been taking advantage of the USB port. I put downloaded TV episodes and movies on a flash drive, hook it up to the USB port and I'm watching my shows on this Smart TV. Pure. Simple. Easy. Fantastic.I also linked up the audio to my Sony Bluray home theater system using the builtin Simplink feature. That way the remote on the TV controls the sound volume on the Sony Home theater at the same time. No more using 2 remotes as with my previous LCD.The 3D is great also. Just great. If you haven't seen 3D on a home set compared to a movie theater, it is night and day. While a movie theater relies on projectors, can appear low light and washed out at times, the 3D on a home passive system is bright and pops out right at you.I highly recommend this set.

I've been watching a badly cracked TV for the past year and a half while waiting for the perfect television.  After looking and looking, and keeping my eye on this one for quite some time, I finally made the jump.I've had this TV for about a month now.  For the most part, I think this is the best TV available on the market right now in the 65\" category.First and foremost, I like the 3D concept, and think it's nice in the movie theater, but the 3D at home, I think is WAY better.  It seems deeper and honestly, it feels like I have a window to a movie set in the house.  I enjoy 3D at the movies. I absolutely LOVE it at home with this TV.  Amazing!!  The range is pretty good too.  We can sit almost anywhere in the living room (i.e.- at an angle to the TV) and it still not lose the effect.  The one thing I did notice is that if I sit on the floor and look up at the TV, the 3D doesn't work and it's just double vision.  I like that it's passive 3D.  We have a whole stash of glasses from the movies, so we never have a shortage of glasses, including the kids sizes.  It also converts regular 2D programs into 3D.  It's decent, does the trick and the kids love it.  It's certainly not the same as content created in 3D, but it's a nice feature, especially since there isn't a ton of 3D content available right now.The color on this TV is pretty good.  The best thing about it is that you can go through and customize it if you feel like the saturation isn't deep enough, or the color temp is too cool or warm for your liking.  The negative, is that if you're watching this TV at an angle, the coloring does look washed out.  But it's certainly not a deal breaker.I like the fact that it's an LED.  It doesn't get hot and hasn't affected our energy bill.I bought this TV just after LG released the 2012 version, and did a pretty extensive comparison.  I couldn't find any features on the 2012 version that merited a $1,000 increase in price.  The 2012 version has wi-fi built in, and this version requires a USB dongle that's included.  I plugged it in when I got, it's not visible and it's worked just fine.All in all, I'm super happy with this TV.  None of the \"negatives\" are deal breakers for me, more just things I've noticed.

You will need some help assembling the TV stand. . Opened it upThe screen is glossy. We have a big window in our living room and the light that comes through that window doesn't manage to annoy me. When the TV is off it looks like a mirror but when I'm watching tv I do see myself at times but that's only when I look for glare. Not a deal breaker for meOut of the box the picture was great. You might want to adjust to your standards. A little adjustments and the picture was excellent. I kind of like the soap opera effect of some shows so I just turn on True Motion. I don't have cable so receiving channels over air antenna was crucial. It received every channel with good reception and high quality. I like how it has to bars showing you the reception and quality of the channel you are watching. The Samsung was unable to do that. PS3 games look amazing on it. Blu Ray movies are outstanding. THE WI-FI dongle does an excellent job. I stream Netflix, Hulu, Vudu on the highest quality available without problems. Quality is almost the same as blu ray. Samsung built in wi-fi was the worst. Overall I made the right choice especially after I hacked it with an $8 RCA remote from walmart. With the Hack, now it's the best TV out there for the price. I would recommend this to all my friends. READ ALONG FOR THE HACKLOCAL DIMMING, THX, AND DVR BECOME AVAILABLE AFTER A SERVICE HACK. Basically you need a Logitech Harmony remote or for me a $8 RCA universal remote did it. First of all let me say the all the details are on AVS forum, and it explains there what to move in order to get those 3 options turned on your TV. Is really easy if you stick to the instructions. After I did that and connected a hard drive to my Tv, I now have a DVR to record digital channels through the TV input. I have THX mode and also local dimming.

It arrived damaged and inoperative due to a large dent on the back enclosure. The packers repacked immediately and I ordered the same item from Amazon.  The service was fast and another TV was shipped the same day. We got the replacement in perfect condition in 4 days.  This was pretty fast since it was in the middle of the holidays (Dec 11) and there was a lot of pressure on shipments. Got excellent service from the white glove process but make sure there are 2 delivery persons unless you will be there to help with some of the lifting (if necessary).TV Performance: Excellent- The 2D HD picture is amazing.  Great detail, depth, and color, and very good blacks.  Much better than our previous TV which was a RP Sony 60 inch LCD. After calibration using the \"calibration wizard\" the picture was even better. I also used the recommendations from CNET on a similar set. This set has a glossy screen (unlike the other LW5600's which are matted).  I read many complaints about the reflections but the good news is that it was not as bad I thought it would be. The screen is dark-tinted so it does not reflect as bad as glass, and in many cases the bright picture overcomes most of the reflections.  Of course if you insist on finding a reflection you will find a few.  In the evening or with shades drawn the picture is outstanding and the 3D has engaging detail and \"pop\". My wife likes the glossy look - she says it looks \"up-scale\" when the TV is off rather than having a big matted-dull screen.The HD 3D performance is astounding.  I was not ready for the excellent depth and detail especially from a 3D video source such as a 3D streaming feed or Blue-ray 3D DVD. The passive glasses are inexpensive and do a great job -especially since LG updated the algorithm to achieve 1080i for each eye. Additionally, with the passive approach there are no head aches, eye strains, off-angle issues, cross-talk, battery re-charging, OR the high cost to allowing 5-6 folks watch 3D using the expensive active glasses.  You can even lie down, tilt your head, or get up, walk around and do other things while wearing the passive glasses and still get a reasonable 3D effect!The minor negative surprise was the gradual loss of sharpness, color saturation, and detail at off angle viewing of about 20-30 degrees. The best viewing is within the 25 degree off-angle cone. Viewing from a low angle up at the TV is superior compared to my prevous set. Since then I have evaluated other LCD TVs from off angle and the loss is about the same. It is just more noticeable on a larger 65 inch display.This is a \"Smart TV\" and it was easy to wirelessly link to our cable-router. It even comes with the USB wireless interface dongle if you choose to go wireless. Just make sure you have enough bandwidth to download the HD signal. The apps work well but not the major draw to the TV.  A computer is faster and easier but you can surf the net with the TV's browser if you like.  The premium links such as Vudu, Netflix, etc worked well for us. I also like the \"wii-like\" controller once you get used to it.Connections are comprehensive, easy, and worked as specified.Sound is acceptable for a very flat screen with little room for speaker housings. I enhanced the bass and selected \"Clear-voice\" since I view cable-news, and other popular cable networks and the sound is good enough for those purposes.  For movies and our favorite features I just turn on our 6.1 surround sound system and the sound is great.Overall a great and entertaining product.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for FPS Xbox360 Gaming", "Author": "Kevin Quinn", "ReviewID": "R3SPCG4Z3N5ET6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW! I will purchase every TV in the future from Amazon, and heres why...I purchased the 65LW6500 from amazon last week. for $2,618.98 got the 4gb Xbox + Halo + and free glasses deal. The Xbox wit $50 promo credit and since I ordered Halo before it came out I got $10 promo credit for that. So I upgraded it and got the 4gb Kinect bundle. Figuring it would end up being free so to speak from the $60 in promo credit which was the difference from the 4gb and halo game bundle to the kinect. Not to mention the extra 6 pairs of glasses which were free that carried a normal price of $67. I ordered early friday morning (3am) on 11/18. With a Monday the 28th with 3p-7p as the delivery time/date. Saturday the price had dropped I called and no problems at all refunded me the difference of $59.04. Making the price $2559.94Monday came I was so excited coming from a 43\" rear projection Hitachi that has served me well for more then 10 years now. 3pm came I was waiting at the door, 4pm... 5pm came I still no tv, 6pm nothing. 7pm Still nothing so I went on Amazons customer service live help, talked to Pedro for over 30 minutes which went no wheres. He had someone call me, after 15 min on the phone with him it came down to Ceva the shipping company receiving the order to late friday, and that the delivery date of Monday should not have been available for me to pick as a delivery date. So they refunded me 10%, it wasnt delivered when on the date and time I had picked. It was their error that the date and time was still able to be chosen by me. So that took off another 255.99!The price has now dropped to $2508.04 I called again to get a price adjustment for the price from $2559.94 and the refund hadn't yet hit my account from the last price match, and I got refunded $110.58. So a total of $169.62 off. The price has now dropped to $2438.74 So Ill be calling and getting another price adjustment. But I have already paid slightly more with the refunds of $2449.36 Add in the free xbox, game, and glasss and this thing goes down to around $2100. Couldnt be happier with the purchase and the customer service from Amazon. Price adjustments without questions asked. Litterally by the time I picked up the phone dialed talked to someone and hung up both times so far for the price adjustment its taken no longer than 5 minutes total between the 2 calls.TV Review thoughts on the 65LW6500Im 30 years old and still playing video games. I play Xbox 360 almost daily ( I work midnight shift ) for so reading the posts here about having lag after I already made the purchase had me nervous. Playing COD MW3 on XBL I didnt like seeing people mention lag. So once I got the tv set up and surround sound. I jumped on MW3 Multiplayer and in to a game my friends were playing in. I got slaughted 1-11 before I raged quit. I only got the one kill cause he was calling in a predator. I wasnt even able to see where I was being killed from. Back out and go through the settings, notice the 'game' mode. That I thought I had selected but apparently didnt. Go back in the game and finished the round 30-7. I had to change my sensitivity from 4 to now 7. But have since backed it down to 6 while I get used to the huge screen. So any one worried about FPS lag. Im going to go with there is none, and if there is, Im not able to notice. But again I was using a 10+ year old tv. That probably had only a 60hz refresh rate, maybe even slower ( if slower is possible ).The Passive 3D was a big selling point to me and why I went with LG instead of a Samsung or Panny. I purchased Alice in Wonderland in 3D jumped foward a few chapters and I litterally smiled for the 20 minutes or so. Very impressed with the 3D aspect so far. I haven't yet gone watched the entire movie yet. But from that short amount of time I was impressed, and didnt notice any of the black lines or gaps Ive read about. But I sit on about '5 o'clock' from the tv, so Im on a bit of an angle, and about 12 feet away.I ended up purchasing the Harmony One remote and got the service menu figured out which was annoying to do. Got the TV, cable box, AV Receiver, Xbox 360, and Bluray Player all hooked up and working perfectly. Unlocked the THX modes but Now I just have to mess around some and tweak some settings more to my liking. Have to check out a dark movie to see how much light leak I have but again coming from a 10+ year old tv. Im obviously not picky with that kind of thing.So far highly impressed with the Amazons customer service on a purchase such as this tv. Order everything from there but never a TV and was iffy about ordering a TV online instead of from the local Bestbuy, Sams, Costco etc. Very happy with the tv purchase so far.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "So happy I bought this tv directly from Amazon", "Author": "John Smith \"lotta juice\"", "ReviewID": "R2MWNRHLRYU32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Where to begin...been waiting for passive 3D, never liked the idea of wearing expensive active glasses that flicker and dim when not facing the tv. So when I heard of LG's passive 3D technology I raced to the nearest best buy and watched a demonstration. Being very impressed with the picture quality and brightness, I was sold. I have been a fan of plasma screens for over eight years and have owned two. This was a big step for me because I felt led's in the past looked unnatural especially flesh tones. I have to say blacks are almost as good as plasma along with flesh tones. So I ordered the 65\" because of it's size (been using a 50\"). What a difference, it's overwhelming! Setting up was a breeze, up and running in 15 min. Now for the bad news, while watching the tv my eyes immediately focused in on a green dot, just under the center of the screen. I got close to the screen and there it was a dead pixel glowing green. Using the 3D only intensified the green dot. So I called Amazon and they set up an exchange. Unfortunately Amazon was out of stock and it took a month before I got notification that the tv was being shipped. Hats off to Amazon's policies for exchange.

In fact, the colors are so bright, you don't even notice when the TV is on.  Two elements that I was disappointed with...  The tv only has an optical audio output to connect to a surround sound system.  I had intended to use my existing Bose system, but without the RCA outputs, that wasn't possible.  Second, I love the Smart Remote, I just wish it worked with my cable box too!  Unfortunately, I connect via a digital cable box, so the channel change and search functions are not operative.

Amazon's customer service and 30-day return policy were important to me.I loved the fact that when I ordered I could select a delivery date and time from the drop down box.  I ordered on a Saturday and I received an email confirmation of the delivery time from Amazon on Monday morning and from the delivery company on Tuesday morning.  The TV arrived today almost exactly in the middle of the three hour delivery window.  The \"white glove\" or \"enhanced delivery\" service was terrific.  The two guys quickly unboxed the unit, put it on the stand, and then lifted it onto my TV stand.  We plugged it in, turned it on, and determined that it was working.  This unit was supposed to come with four pair of 3D glasses, but only came with two.  I noted that on the delivery receipt before I signed, and after the delivery people left, I sent an email to Amazon.  Within an hour or so Amazon sent a return email with a phone number for LG Customer Service.  I called them and didn't have to wait long to get a customer service rep who was very polite.  While she waited on the phone, she asked me to email her a copy of my Amazon receipt.  She got it instantly, and then arranged to ship out the additional two pair of glasses.Setup was pretty good on this TV.  You have to take a little USB key out of its plastic and plug it into a port on the back of the TV to get the wireless connection working.  When putting in my wireless security key, I wasn't sure how to use the onscreen keyboard to enter numbers.  Turns out if you hit the FAV key on your remote, the onscreen keyboard toggles between lower case, upper case, and numbers.Thanks to Amazon reviews I read before I purchased, I knew there was a picture wizard so I hunted around a little bit and found that.  It is a VERY nice interface for adjusting all of your settings (brightness, contrast, tint, etc.).  IMHO, this eliminates the need to pay someone to calibrate your TV.Once I hooked up to my wireless network, the TV was pretty quick to tell me there was a firmware update to download and I told it to go ahead.  When that was done, the TV powered off for a second and then back on, and then notified me that another update was waiting, so I downloaded that one too.  Evidently, the updates needed to be done sequentially instead of just going to the latest one.  I didn't time it, but I'm guessing it was a five minute process and you could skip it if you want to.  Personally, it makes me feel good about LG that they regularly provide these updates.The picture is fine, but perhaps not as razor sharp as I recall my friend's 55\" Samsung to be.  This might be a reflection of me not remembering it right, or a function of the fact that this is 10\" bigger.  My son is coming over Wednesday and bringing a blu-ray disc, and he has a better eye for this stuff so I'll come back and provide an update on picture quality after we go through that.I just purchased a Yamaha receiver and have my u-verse box, blu-ray player, and AppleTV all plugged into that, so I only have a single HDMI going to the TV.  I also use a Harmony Remote to control everything (what a Godsend that is).Overall, the Amazon delivery experience was top notch from scheduling all the way through to delivery, and also their very quick response with the LG phone number when I complained about the glasses missing.  LG was very good with the customer service (although the phone call took a loooong time, I was put through to a customer service rep within minutes).More to come........UPDATE 1/22/12:  I've now watched a movie with Blu-ray and have a football game on.  I am very happy with the picture.  The viewing angle, in particular, is very wide so it won't be a problem for my Super Bowl party.  There is a reflection if I have a lamp on that is next to where I am watching.  I expected that so I'm o.k. with not using that lamp while watching TV.

The delivery was not the best as the box it came in looked like it had been in a combat zone. Amazingly the TV worked. This is a big and heavy set and from a viewing distance of about ten feet it is like having your own small movie theater. I agree with the previous reviews that picture is terrific right out of the box. The sound is surprising good. I expected a lot worse. I was satisfied with the black levels (a failing with lcd sets, this is an edge lit set) in a well lit room however if you turn out all the lights and just look at the set displaying an all black screen and it doesn't look so good. With a picture on it looks fine. The 3D is surprisingly good and I was able to view full length 3D movies without any eye fatigue. The 3D glasses are light and comfortable and the 3D effect is still there when viewed off center or from below the screen. The normal remote is long and thin and if you have small hands you will need two hands to use the remote in some cases. I would highly recommend this set to any one the wants 65 inch TV except for one problem. After about 700 hours of operation a thin black vertical line appeared from top to bottom about three inches from the left side of the screen. It does not appear on turn on but about fifteen minutes after turn on. It is a pencil thin line that on closer examination looks like two columns of pixels have turned off.  I called LG service and to their credit a guy showed up the next day to take a look. His assessment was a bad display and he said that they would order a new one. It is two weeks and I am still waiting. One thing about a big set is that it is not easy to work on and wonder how one guy is going to be able to remove the display and put a new one in.

The 3D on this set is just plain amazing.  It is the best 3D I seen (movie theater included).  It's easy on the eyes, and is very clear with little to no cross talk.  I also like the fact that the cheap 3d glasses from the movie theater work, although the LG supplied glasses are definately much more comfortable than the real 3d glasses.I used the service menu hack for harmony remotes to activate both local dimming and thx mode.  I run everything with THX, the colors are absolutely amazing.  The local dimming is alright i guess.  If i look for it I can see it in action, but I'm not sure it buys much.  The biggest issue with the backlight is just the uniformity and leakage around the edges.  Its not really a deal breaker for me but it is something I noticed on dark scenes.  The black level is definately not that stellar and you can see clouds of light from the different led zones.  This annoyed me a little at the beginning, but now I'm used to it and just accept it as an artifact of edge lit sets.Another annoyance is the reflectivity of the set.  Any light behind it is going to reflect big time.  It looks just as shiney as a plasma or the old crt sets.  So if you have windows in front of the tv, you best have curtains or don't try to watch too much during the day.  While this was annoying to deal with, I have blinds and certains on all my windows.  The blinds are sufficient for most tv watching.  If I want to watch 3D, the reflections and glare become more noticeable, although a lot of that is front light reflection off the 3d glasses, which isn't the 3d tvs fault.  So I pull the curtains on 3D. While I would have preferred a matte screen, it isn't a deal breaker for me.  There really aren't any alternatives at this size that aren't glossy.Features of the tv I could careless about are 2D->3D and the smart tv part.  2D->3D does work but it feels gimmicky, i tried a few things with it, but just preferred the 2D over the fake 3D.  The smart tv functionality I just find useless.  It has netflix and some other apps, but honestly I prefer the interface on my other devices that support apps.  However, I have yet to use any apps on any device, because I prefer a real computer which I could just hook up to HDMI.  Smart TVs just seem dumb to me :).I can't really say it enough but the 3d on this set is hands down the best their is.  2D because of the back level being just ok and the uniformity issues with the back lighting are just ok..  That being said, the colors in the THX setting look amazing without any tweaking.  I pretty much set it to THX mode on both 2D and 3D and left everything else alone.  If you are one of those people that have to have the best black level so you don't see those dark grey letter box bars on movies, then don't buy this set.  For the rest of us 90% it looks good enough, and still beats my CFL backlit lcd.  Do yourself a favor if you buy this set, invest in a harmony remote or some other that can unlock the service menu.

It requires no setup or synching, used cheap glasses that don't have to be charged, doesn't flicker or give you headaches when you watch it, and most of all just looks wonderful.  I watched \"Tangled\" in 3D with my wife, and the effect was better than in the theater.  I have also watched several other 3D tech demos, and LG has nailed it with this technology.2D to 3D Conversion:I wasn't expecting much here, so I was very pleasantly surprised.  I streamed \"Saw 5\", which was shot in 3D, in HD over the Netflix app on the TV over WiFi.  When it has started playing.  I thought, \"I wonder if the 2D to 3D will work well with this\".  Yep.  Not just well, but perfectly.  Since the movie was shot in 3D, the conversion worked VERY well.  I have also used it to convert various TV shows and games to 3D, and while not as good as content that was originally intended for 3D, it is still very good.  \"Skyrim\" with 2D to 3D turned on is amazing.Aesthetics:The TV looks amazing mounted on my fireplace.  Solid black with a thin, clear plastic border around the very outside edge.  Also, at 1.7\" thich all the way down, it is just incredible that everything fits in there.My only complaint is the glossy screen, but it is also a feature that I enjoy, so I'm at war with myself on this one.  It reflects any light source, but it also makes the picture on the screen look amazing.  My suggestion is just to eliminate light sources on the opposite wall, and you will be good to go.Overall:Overall, this is the best TV I've ever owned, or seen in a store for that matter.  I'm sure that will change in a couple months when the new models come out, but for now, this is the \"top of the line\" as far as I'm concerned.  LG is on the right track to become THE leader in 3D televisions until \"no glasses 3D\" becomes a reality.  You will not be disappointed.  After watching a few things on this, the $2500 you spent isn't even missed anymore.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great LED LCD TV!", "Author": "Spartan480", "ReviewID": "R2OVEA9TEH0ZZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive owned this TV about a month,to allow it some break in time. I must admit I was somewhat skeptical regarding large screen edge lit lcd TVs (led is the backlighting, led is still lcd tv, dont fall for the marketing hype)because of clouding or bleeding. In fact, my first LG 65 inch arrived and had some nasty clouding on it, which look like white, cloudy spots on the TV. The light from the backlight shows through the edges somewhat, and this was evident even on my replacement.This is minor drawback, you will not achieve plasma like blacks, but plasmas cant achieve the brightness and colors of an LED either. Its a trade off Im satisfied with. Watching blu rays and football games on this display is bad ass! Amazon had terrific customer service and sent me replacement right away and it arrived the next week. I was more impressed with Home Direct Delivery then I was with Pilot Freight, but at least the second one is working great. Im not a huge 3d fan so sorry cant report on that. I bought it to replace an aging DLP and I was getting tired of changing mercury filled bulbs every other year. The picture really pops, yes it has a reflective screen but with creative lighting arranging its not really a problem in my living room. The picture is crisp and vivid and very bright. I would recommend turning the backlight and brightness down some. Most stores have all TVs on torch mode, to attract your eyes to the brightness screens. I definitely recommend you take the time to calibrate your TV, I went to AVS Forum and there are some hack codes you can use to unlock THX mode, LED local dimming and such but I dont want to void my warrant or even risk messing up the TV. I did however use THX settings recommended by certain LG enthusiasts. I wont list their names here since I dont have their permission. Allow yourself 2-4 weeks for the TV to get some hours on it, I think my blackness levels have improved. The audio from the TV is poor, but as with most large screen sets, most people have separate home theater setups and turn off the TV speakers anyway. After the picture quality, I must add I like how the TV connects to my wireless network with a supplied adapter, and I can go into the menu and do a firmware update on the spot. I had some questions and even was able to chat with LG customer service to answer some questions I had. The set comes with two remotes, one is your standard remote, with some neat quick menu options. The other is a motion controlled remote, like the Nintendo Wii, and it has a Power, Home and enter button on it and it makes for quick on the fly adjustments in the very intuitive menu system. Some people may not like the magic wand but its more of a preference thing. If you want to change like your color settings for example, use the regular remote, it makes it easier. For switching from Expert 1 or turning down the intelligent light sensor, use the wand. Another recommendation, the TruMotion on the TV, gives off a soap opera effect on what you are watching, it makes what you are watching look fake, just my two cents. About the worst part of the TV is that it picks up fingerprints, smudges, dust, you name it, very easily. Invest in a nice microfiber to dust. I have my TV paired up with a Yamaha A2000 with one HDMI cable and all my components to the receiver and everything just works. Something to keep in mind, the Hdmi connectors are on the far left of the tv, meaning if your Av rack is on the right your going to need a longer hdmi cable, something I learned the hard way. If you can maneuver your gear to the left of the hdmi jacks, that would be awesome, thought I would let you know. Basically, if you want an energy efficent, sleek looking, sharp,crisp and sweet picture look no farther than the LG 65LW6500.

One thing to comment on is the off-center viewing. Granted Plasmas have no restrictions on this and that is what I was used to. This TV, being an LED/LCD, I was a little dissapointed in what I thought was a quick transition from black blacks to grey-ish blacks when not-too far off-center---always the bain of LCD's. As noted a lot, the sound is tinny at best. But when dead-on, the set looks good. 3D watching has been minimal, only watching some short segments that LG has in their apps you can download. The wireless feature works fine, but we chose to go wired using a Netgear device that converts your home wiring into some form of \"Ethernet\". Streaming on Netflicks and Amazon all look good. As for why this TV, I was interested in the passive glasses, vs the others. And, it looks good to me. I tried the 2D to 3D function. It is interesting. I watched Rango (animaated) and thought quite often it does a nice job. I tried to watch a football game, but to me it looked the players were a couple feet off the ground. That lasted a few minutes and back to 2D.  You will comments on the screes being very glossy, and it is. Something you may want to consider. I was surpised how reflective it was. At least Panny and Samsung try to put some anti-reflective coating on theirs---none here.  There are plenty of choices in 65\" TV's.

We installed it on the wall - please understand - this TV is HEAVY - almost 100 pounds without the stand!  Also, the cabinet (from the side) is fairly thin, which looks great.  However, the glass front extends past the edge of the cabinet about 1/4\" all around the TV.  So, it made me feel like it wasn't \"safe\" to let the edge of the TV sit on the ground, as I was afraid that this edge would be damaged.  I ended up using the styrofoam packing along the bottom edge of the TV so the edge would be protected as the TV was sitting on the ground while I hooked up my components.I hardwired the TV to the internet, and was expecting all the native apps (youtube, netflix, etc) to work quickly with no issues.  However, the TV kept giving me a message that stated I needed to upgrade the software.  I tried for two days to click on the link (on the TV screen) that would allow the download to begin, but it never did.  So, I wasn't able to use any of the cool features that I bought the unit for.  I spent about 4-5 hours total trying to figure it out over the course of a few days.

Finally, I broke down and called technical support.  Within 15 minutes I was good to go.  It seems that the only way it will work is to download the .zip folder onto your desktop from the LG site, unzip it, then put it on the file on the thumb drive (as opposed to loading it directly onto the drive from the internet).

I do notice skipping in the video due to the refresh rate, if this is really important go with the plasma.

The television was delivered and we mounted it, hooked up the cable and dvd player. The tv looks great. Starting around 6/2012 during the routine software updates it stopped at about 50% completion. Without the software update I am not able to use the smart features and apps like Netflix. I contacted customer service and attempted all their suggestions to no avail. After numerous calls and dealing with the language dialect and getting frustrated with customer service wanting me to repeat the same things that I had done time and time again,  I gave up. So around 9/12 I decided to call customer service again, great this time I got someone that I could communicate well with who immediately set up an in-home repair appointment. I contacted the service company and they were going to order an new board for the set and bring with them in the event that they could not upgrade the software manually. The board was on backorder with no release date. With no release date in sight for the part, LG offered to buy back the TV. While considering what I would replace the set with, I received another call from LG stating that the part was due to be released around 11/15. I called the service repair company and informed them and they were going to put the part on order. I called the service repair company towards the end of 11/2012 and was informed that the board was now shown as obsolete in the system. As of 12/17/12 I have decided to take the buyback offer from LG. The tv is working and viewable. I am just not able to take full advantage of the set's capabilities. I'm giving the TV 3 stars because it looks great. I like the passive 3D and the 2D-3D is impressive too. 2 stars would be more appropriate because I don't like the fact that the TV will never perform at it's peak therefore I will be returning it to LG. The size of this tv works great in my living room. I am frustrated at the process I will face to replace a passive 3D TV of this size. So in short don't buy this television as there will be no available parts to service it should you have issues down the line.LG Infinia 65LW6500 65-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great 3D TV", "Author": "glindagoodwitch", "ReviewID": "R1IGCZGLY1HQ1Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 65\" LG Infinia 65LW6500 Cinema 3D TV is great!

The 3D performance when watching 3D movies (the 10 that are available) is really good as long as you are at the correct distance. Make sure you are not more than 10ft. from the TV or the 3D doesn't seem very three dimensional. The 2D to 3D converter is a joke. It really don't make anything 3D, it just makes the picture blurry and gives you a headache!The clarity of the TV was very good until the display went dead about a month ago. We have never had a TV go bad before but 3 or 4 calls to LG got things moving in the warranty department. They contracted a local company who wanted to charge us a fee to repair the televison under warranty. After another couple calls to LG, they got around to finding someone else to do in-home repair for free. Well, it's been a month and we are still chasing after the repair guy who claims to have ordered the part. We were finally tired of waiting so we went out and purchased a Vizio 65\" for $1000.00 less. So far the Vizio is just as good as the LG.

The wireless on the Vizio seems much faster and the remote has a keypad which is nice when you are looking for movies online.Don't waste your money on this LG unless you want to spend an extra $1000.00 on a tv with no real warranty and 3D that you may or may not be able to use in 5 years!", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "This TV is over 3 years old!!!", "Author": "ITCJRB", "ReviewID": "R2DDBKKFQIJ9O0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hello,What I don't understand about this particular TV is the current price!!!

Lo and behold, the demo at that Best Buy also had a dead pixel band, green this time, running down the left side of the screen right around the same spot.I am now very weary of buying this TV because 1) the screen may not be able to handle one months worth of on-time before the screen goes bad or 2) the TV can't handle the analog input signal properly distributed to Best Buy TVs or 3) there is a manufacturing problem with the screen.I read somewhere that the 65\" screen is made by a different manufacturer than the equivalent 55\" screen.I am going to hold off on buying this TV until I can find a good, ell QA'd 65\" passive 3D TV.  The Vizio didn't get as good reviews as the LG and active 3D glasses are 1) expensive 2) flicker gives me a headache and 3) uncomfortably heavy to wear for an entire movie.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money", "Author": "Tiger094", "ReviewID": "RSAP7SA7HWH3X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV online for $1500 and was expecting a great tv after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately there wern't any professional reviews on this tv. When I got the Tv i noticed how light it was compared to my failed plasma. After connecting and powering up, I was initially impressed. I saw this tv at Frys electronics and was impressed and decided to purchase the lg. I calibrated to the tv to enhance the black levels. At Frys the blacks looked good but they may be using an enhanced signal. This tv did not get good blacks at all,dark scenes were looking  more like day scenes. It was kinda interesting at first seeing normally blacked out scenes day. But it detracts from the effect that the scene portrays. Also, I noticed alot of blooming, where dark areas are washed out due to light areas bleeding in. Next, I noticed alot of pixeling/blurring during scenes where the camera pans. Not acceptable for a tv rated at 240hz. I was constantly always having to make minor picture adjustments for different movies or shows due to the lack of continuity. Some shows were too dim, others too bright. On the good side, the tv had a alot of detail and I liked the passive 3d. Also the magic wand is a cool feature. Browsing movies at netflix via the built in wi fi was easy and the movie titles were easy to read.  The wi fi connection was solid. The sound was really good too, loud, clear and good quality. I almost went back to a plasma tv after the experience with this tv. After alot of head scratching, web surfing I decided to give the more expensive and a lil over my budget Sony 55 XBR 929 . WOW, what a difference!! The picture on the Sony is everything I had hoped for, the picture is very comparative to a plasma. deep rich colors and inky blacks are the norm. No motion blur is detectable either. I am very happy with this tv and amazed at how led technology can come close to a plasma and only use about 1/3 of the energy. The only time I detect blooming is when the credits are rolling with a black backround. When the movie or show is on, I dont detect any. I set the tv and really havent had a need to touch the settings which is how it should be.I had the 55 inch which is 240hzLG 55LX6500 55-Inch 3D 1080p 240 Hz LED Plus LCD HDTV", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG Infinia 65LW6500", "Author": "vikch", "ReviewID": "R11FC8ZKZ3D5FN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was not very happy with the Quality of the picture, Clear motion rate is very low.
