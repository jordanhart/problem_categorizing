Be a little cautious with gaming.", "Author": "Ral K.", "ReviewID": "R3CV88YI7EJQKI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Summary: Great value for a 3D LED set. Passive 3D is much more impressive than I initially thought it would be. Input lag a deterrent for timing-strict gaming.Bought this TV because of its glowing reviews and it did deliver, as expected.Picture Quality: Above Average -> Great. It's on par with Sharp's and Vizio's best models. Edge LED lighting leaves a little bit to be desired in terms of artifacts and black/white levels, but I'd be surprised if its noticed by the average viewer. It's does light and colors really well. Local dimming and tru-motion makes movie and TV watching an absolute blast.Sound: This TV surprising packs some wallop behind its audio. Definitely not surround sound material, but on par with basic soundbars. I was impressed to say the least -- quite possibly one of the best out-of-the-box audio for thin LED TV's.Passive 3d: The bonafide specialty of this set. LG does not lie when they say they do the best 3d around -- it really is exceptional, even with just using its 2d-3d feature. This can make even Netflix streaming pop out of your screen. And did I mention it can make YouTube videos look absolutely phenomenal? If you're after 3d, I doubt you can get much better than this set for the cost in the foreseeable future.Gaming: It's fatal flaw. Keep in mind it does have a game mode, and if you turn every feature off, you can get between 20-50ms input lag. While this is acceptable, perhaps even barely noticeable for most casual games such as RPG's, Adventures, etc, it borders between tolerable and annoying for fighting and FPS games where player input timing is more strict. Sadly, I'm the latter type of gaming fan. LG continually patches their TV's though, so if it can get closer to 5ms I'll be perfectly content -- I'll even update this review. But for right now, it leaves much to be desired. The lag is not enough that warrants a return.. at least yet.Features: Perhaps one of the more feature-rich TV's out there. It comes with the usual suspects like Netflix, Hulu, social media but it also introduces LG apps -- an appstore for your TV. It's kinda gimmicky at the moment, but I can see this being the trend for future TV's. It also has its own self-calibration tool, which is a nice free way to correctly calibrate your TV. Expert picture modes allow you to have access to even MORE picture options, right down to modifying individual color levels. Too bad there's only two expert picture slots though.Usability/Other items: As feature-rich as this TV is, I hate how it does not have a QWERTY remote control. It makes it extremely hard to search on YouTube or type status messages on Twitter. Moreover, the magic motion controller is a slight help at best, terribly useless at worst -- it's hard to aim the cursor on the right inputs if the buttons are too close together to begin with anyway. The options the TV gives you far outweighs this negative though. Getting 4 free glasses makes this a true out-of-the-box 3DTV too.Final Score: 3.5/5, rounded down to 3. I would gladly give up some of this TV's features to reduce input lag further, but the TV itself performs very well. If you're in the market for 3d, you really cannot go wrong with this set -- I firmly believe passive 3d will be the trend for future 3d sets. Otherwise, it performs the same/on par with sets in the same price range.I'll be stress-testing out the TV for the remainder of my 30 day return period, and will update this review with any news.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's a nice set", "Author": "Chris Holmes", "ReviewID": "R309SQYCH8CSQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this set about a week ago and I've ran it through the ringer to test out everything.  So far I'm pretty impressed.The drawbacks aren't very many and they're not too much of a game-changer.  One, there are no audio outputs from the tv other than an optical output.  If you have a legacy sound system that doesn't have an optical input, it's not the end of the world.  For an extra ~$25 or so you can get a stereo adapter that transfers the optical signal to coax or composite RCA analog.  $100 to get yourself one that'll do dolby surround (which I had to do).  It was a bit off-putting, and I was tempted to just get a new home theater system, but it was necessary for me to get (and save a couple hundred more dollars) who has a ton of extra gaming and video devices that I use.  It's easier to just run an audio out from the television to the home theater system and plug everything into the tv to not have to mess with too many settings.  I think you'll find audio output sparsity with most newer sets anyway.  Digital age is taking over, I suppose.The 2D to 3D features on this set are, well, hilarious.  I have to commend the programmers who designed this set as I'm sure trying to write code to fit every visual situation will have a few coding hiccups, and over all it is a great feature.  With very well-defined images, i.e. a strong foreground, a background, a middle ground subject, the forcing of the 3d image from a 2d image works amazingly.  It doesn't bring anything towards you, mind, but will definitely push the backgrounds back for a pretty believable and often stunning picture.  But, there are times when the image on the screen gets kind of confused and makes an approximation.  This happens particularly often with women's shirts with words on them.  The face will seem to come forward too far, the neck will be pushed back, the chest... well, let's just use the word I used earlier:  hilarious.  Slightly exaggerated, yes perhaps, but makes you wonder if the people designing feature did it on purpose?  Speculation, probably not true...dirty, dirty coders.  It's something I noticed, and others may not, but I think it's worth mentioning.  90% positive on this feature of the set, I'll give it.Navigation on the set is a little weird if you want to get through the menus.  It's designed more for the magic remote (the apps, too) I've found, which is pretty much just like using a Wii remote if you're familiar with that.  A traditionalist like myself tried using the regular remote which took a while trying to weed through the often clumped-together features.  Plus, I'm all for the progress of technology and all, but calling 240hz TruMotion, or whatever they call it, would be easier to figure out for the laymen in the long run if you put an explanation bubble popup upon hovering over an item in the menus.  Also, by not listing the 240hz feature leads to a bit more confusion as the settings on the frame refresh sensitivity go from 1 to 10.  They assumed people don't know what a hertz is, I suppose.  Figuring out trumotions 1 to 10, I had to guess what I was messing with on screen.Turning off the 240hz feature might be desirable, too, if you are annoyed at fine letters \"crawling\" on your screen.  There was a feature in there that turned down an edge-refining in the picture which would've solved that problem, I think.  I found it once, but I have yet to find it again.  Another menu issue.If you're an avid gamer, like myself, you're going to want to turn off all the nice little features that come along with this set.  There is about 1/5 of a second lag on the image with doodads engaged.  Halo looked pretty awesome with the forced 3D and Trumotion turned on, but that 1/5 of a second is the difference between a headshot and betrayal(s).  It was a very unfortunate game I played that day.I got a chance to look at the previous model (55LW5500) to test the passive 3D features of the old with the features on this one(55LW6500).  There was talk that they would improve the 3D resolution somehow as with passive 3d you're essentially taking a 1080 pixel image down to 540 for each eye.  I read talk about improvements to this feature, and I think (comparing a couple days apart) the 3D image is improved.  I wouldn't know how they improved it as from what I can tell, the polarizing film on the screen I would have thought was set in stone, and maybe some of my own psychological want for the system to be better is creeping into the review, but I think it's been improved.  It's hard to tell without having an active shutter 3D system in front of me with the older and newer models, but I'm pleased with the image.  If you want the 3D image without the hassle of the active shutter glasses (which I did), I think this is your set.The picture is great, the colors are great, LED backlighting works well, lightweight set easy to mount on a wall, picture wizard gives you a pretty good approximation of what you would want for a picture.  In a phrase, I'm pleased.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG did a great job on 3d with this tv.. 47LW6500", "Author": "Paul m.", "ReviewID": "RZYMFNRLAW12O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I give this tv a 4 star rating.I'm one of the people who don't like the active shutter glasses.  primarily because I wear glasses already and adding a heavy second pair bothered me.  My cousin purchases the sony 3d tv with active shutter glasses and I can say first hand that after watching 2/3 of avatar 3d I had a splitting headache.  this pretty well told me active shutter wasn't for me.  I blamed the headache on the weight of the glasses more then the shutter.  however I can't prove that.  what I can say is that after reviewing the differences in 3d I decided that passive 3d was for me.  my reason for this is that I was able to watch 3d avatar at the theater without getting a headache so I thought since it was the same technology it should work.  well it's been 3 day since i've had the lg passive 3d tv and after watching avatar, despicable me, and tangled I can say NO headaches!!!!!!  I can also tell you the 3d quality may be equal to theater real3d but doesn't have the sharpness of active shutter 3d.  I know I gave up quality for no headaches or eye strain. But i'm ok with that as I think the quality of passive 3d is of more value to me then having to wear heavy 3d glasses.  There is also a large bonus of being able to bring home the 3d glasses from hoyts and reagal theaters to have spares.what I didn't expect:in the past I have owned sharp, samsung, sony and now an LG tv.  in all previous cases I always used my bose theater system for sound as I'm sure everyone can contest tv's suck for sound.  there isn't any depth or quality and usually they sound like talking into a can.with LG I was seriously surprised.  the sound quality was far better than my samsung 40 led tv.  is it as good as the bose system?  Heck no! but it did justify putting the bose upstairs in my bedroom with the samsung led and leaving the LG tv solo downstairs for the kids. :)  that's a double bonusthanks LG  I got an unexpected upgrade to my nighttime tv.quality picture of 2d:The quality is almost equal to samsung and sony at the same size.  if I where rating sony or samsung I would rate them a 5 star for quality and LG comes in at 4.75.  almost as good but not quite.  it's not that I see lines or pixilations or shadowing.so my 4 star rating is because I took 1 point off for the uselss documentation they send and the lack of programable remotes without having to deal with going to the lg site and finding the key codes for it. then I gave them .25 for the sound quality.  which  by the way I would take off .25 from samsung and sony.Big negative for those with boses older aquistic system  the lg doesn't have a audio out port so you can't use bose aquistic with it.  this didn't affect me but I know friends who own the system and wanted to give everyone fair warning.  you can ofcourse use optic out as always.  For the fun of it I had one friend bring over his bose system to try useing through the headset out port,  it definately isn't recommended. Bad sound and bad quality plus you have to manage both remotes all the time.anyway this was my review,  as an owner of LG I'll see with this model if I ever buy another.47LW6500", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV for an Amazing Price", "Author": "g0002", "ReviewID": "RNFDZ2WIKXMMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first time leaving a review on a product that I bought online. First off....WOW. I think that this is an amazing TV. For a little background, I have been waiting and waiting to finally get an upgraded TV. I have been doing my homework, reading about the different TV's, and what they offer. I am big movie person and the HD picture was really important to me. I was checking out the 5600 and was really pleased with what I saw at Best Buy. The reason I purchased the 6500 was because of the price on Amazon (the updates to the picture quality and the 240 hz also helped....:) ) The price was so good in fact, that I probably would not have been able to get this TV otherwise.HD 2D picture is fantastic.3D conversion is just amazing whether with bluray, or even HD TV. I have been watching Baseball, Basketball and Hockey finals in forced 3D. Awesome. I even think that it makes the HD TV picture look better.Blu-Ray 3D - The first night I received the television, I popped in the actual Tron 3D disk and I was absolutely blown away. I know that there is a lot of talk of the shutter versus the passive and loss of quality between the two, trust me, I was nervous about it too......the picture/detail was simply beautiful. If there is any loss, and I would be hard pressed to say that there is, it is not worth the debate when you add the non-cost of the 3d glasses.PS3 3D Gameplay - is simply awesome. Black Ops and MLB The show are that much more fun. It takes gaming to the next level. I have not experienced much lag as said in other reviews, but I also have my Tru-Motion set to low.Set-up and Menu - Set up was easy and the smart TV features are great. Easy and quick to navigate.The fact that there is a head phone jack has been great. I have plugged in My Klipsh computer speakers and the sound is perfect for the size room we have at the moment. It saves the need to buy surround/receiver right away. The sound/volume of the actual TV is not bad, I mean it lacks range, but come on, it's a flat screen. With all the negative talk, I was expecting the sound to be a lot softer/worse than it is.I know that this isn't a huge technical review, but from an person who expects Awesome, this TV is it. If you have any doubts, don't worry about it, just do it.I do recommend that you go through the color set up. That does make a difference and doesn't take that long.I had some friends over the other day and showed them some of these features and they were amazed, especially of the 3d picture.I hope this helps!", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great tv for the price", "Author": "Dustin", "ReviewID": "RN7318LDW9553", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Last January I had a dilemma. I wanted to upgrade an old 40\" Samsung 720P LCD tv but I couldn't decide whether or not to purchase a 3D tv since the technology was so new. I decided to play it safe and ended up purchasing a Samsung 55B8500 in February 2010. That particular LED model was the last one to have local dimming backlight, not edge lit. I must say, I'm still beyond happy with my decision because that tv is nearly flawless and 3D technology has certainly improved.Anyways, a year passed and I felt that it was time to purchase a 3D tv. This time to replace my old 40\" Samsung that was now in my bedroom. I researched online and went to multiple stores comparing brands, sizes and the difference between active and passive 3D. I must've spent a good 2 months before finally choosing this LG model. I love Samsung and had originally wanted the new UN55D8000 model with the slim bezel but it was a little more than I wanted to spend. Plus, after a while I had come to like passive 3D more than active mainly because I wouldn't have to deal with charging the glasses or replacing them(expensive) if they broke.So the main reason I bought this model was for the 3D which I must say is nice. It's not as crisp a picture as active shutter but it's nonetheless clear. Passive 3D only delivers 540 lines to each eye hence halving the 1080p resolution but in all honesty, the picture still looks like it's in HD. The tv delivers great 3D depth and that's what it's all about. One negative about the 3D picture though is that you can make out thin horizontal lines across the whole screen while in 3D mode. BUT, this is only noticeable if you are watching from 5 feet or closer. All passive tvs are like this and the smaller the screen the less noticeable. I watch from 6-8 ft away so I don't notice it at all. Recommended viewing distance for a tv this size is a minimum of 6 ft anyways.The 2D to 3D conversion isn't anything special. The depth isn't quite there and when it is it just doesn't look right. It's fun to play with though.The 2D picture quality is great but one drawback is the edge lighting. It's noticeable in dark scenes and there is uneven screen uniformity. My Samsung is back-lit so I guess I'm spoiled because I've never encountered this before. All I have to say is that I'll never buy another edge-lit tv ever again.Overall, this is a good tv. If you don't want to spend too much on a 3D tv($1400) and don't want to deal with active shutter glasses this is a great tv to have. Although you may want to wait for LG's newer model: LG 47LX9500. It has local dimming backlight, 480hz refresh rate, and a slimmer bezel. Just expect to pay a lot more.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "My 1st HD 3D TV!!!", "Author": "Joe Sirianno", "ReviewID": "R24EPOI9F8GA1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, this is my 1st purchase of an LED 3D type TV since they 1st came out.  I have done extensive research on this purchase, from looking into the Sony Bravia NX810, HX800, EX720 and any other \"decently\" priced 3D TV.  I watched and watched the prices on these items, and all except the NX810 were dropping.  This was kinda scary as if I was going to spend alot of $ on a TV, why would I want one I cannot find anywhere?  The other ones were reasonably priced, but did not include a 3D transmitter or glasses.  After what I would consider \"over researching\", which was not being able to pick out one TV because I saw so many that I liked but yet had either bad reviews (sound - NX810) picture - EX720, or just were year old technology (everything else) I happen to come across this TV on a couple of different websites for a awesome price.  The ONLY downfall was NO reviews anywhere, yet the price was phenomenal on every website but Amazon.  After about a week at the lower price, Amazon dropped their price and I pulled the trigger, even with no reviews.  Well, I just got the TV today and there are still no reviews, but if you are reading mine 1st, take it from a novice TV person and GET THIS TV.  All I can say is WOW!Picture - awesomeSound - better then expectedEase of use - very simple, now just need to tweak settings and transfer cables over to HDMI.3D - Very simple to transfer over to, just a click of a button, and after seeing Gran Turismo 5 in 3D, I was blown away.  Just easy to look at without being overwhelming.  Like I said, this is my 1st TV of this nature, but if anyone has seen 3D they know what I am talking about.Look - wow...this TV is just a knockout...nothing more to say...just have to see it to believe it.In conclusion, this TV was worth the wait if you are getting a 3D TV for the 1st time or thinking of upgrading, have no fear that this TV will meet and exceed your expectations.  It has mine, and I have high ones...I guess over researching allowed to me wait just long enough to get this majestic piece of art.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Much better than I had expected", "Author": "N in LA \"N in Los Angeles\"", "ReviewID": "R118AI6DHLZLZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These are my first impressions after a couple of days.We are totally satisfied and wowed.  First of all the angle of view is just as good as plasma.  There is absolutely no degradation of the picture from even extreme side angels.  The setup was easy and LG's onboard program for adjusting the picture to our preferences was easy.We haven't even watched 3d source content, but are totally blown away the the up conversion from 2D to 3D.  We have watched TV HD sources for the \"Oceans\" series (lots of underwater shots) and Blu-ray DVDs for arial tours of Italy.  Both were amazing.  The underwater shots looked liked we were actually looking through the window of a submarine, and the arial shots like we were actually looking through a window of a helicopter.  Our hats are off to the LG software developers!The effect is like looking through a window, however, as all the depth of field is created from the screen to the distance.  Nothing jumps out at you into the room, but the effect is very realistic for depth of field.I have followed the active vs. passive 3D debate and I'm very fussy about my HD viewing.  That being said, the 3D viewing is a very slight downgrade, maybe 10%, but the 3D effect more than makes up for it when watching the right programs.  No problems with headaches.  You can look around the room with the lightweight glasses on and nothing appears any different.  2D viewing is most excellent with no motion blur.We are more than satisfied with the TV.

Hensel", "ReviewID": "R32NAFM9RK600Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start this review out by saying that I have been following the \"war\" between passive and active 3D for a little bit now.I have only tried active 3D a few times at the store, but I found the glasses to be clunky, overbearing and an all-around pain (Literally... the eye strain was horrid even after a short amount of time). Not to mention, the last thing I need is another thing to charge.Enter passive 3D. Sure, its resolution is a slight bit less than its active sibling, but the difference is so minute that I have not even noticed. Another high point is that that the 3D viewing angle is amazing. I had the glasses on in the kitchen which is about 15 feet from the TV and at probably a 70 degree angle, and I could still see the 3D picture without issues. And the glasses! If you've ever been to a 3D movie in the theaters, they are the exact same. Inexpensive, lightweight and expendable. The only thing I noticed is that the picture is somewhat jittery when you have the TruMotion turned on- even on the Low setting. Last thing I would like to cover with 3D is the upconverting from 2D to 3D. As stated in other reviews, the picture does not pop out as much as it adds depth of field to it. I have my 3D set to 15 (the highest is 20) because 20 gives me some motion sickness.The 2D picture on this TV is absolutely amazing. The blacks are very black and the colors are vivid. As stated in another review, the picture setup is very easy to do and has a few options based upon your tastes. Up above, I mentioned that the 3D picture looks best with TruMotion turned off, but have no fear- the settings for 3D are separate from 2D. And each input's options are separate from one another. The only strange thing I found about changing the settings per input is that you have to hit the Home button to be able to access the the full settings menu. But that's no biggie.Considering how thin this TV is, the sound quality produced by it is quite good. I know that most of you will want to use a HTIB or a soundbar, but for watching at night, the speakers are no slouch.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS TV and Everyone Wants to Watch with ME!", "Author": "Mike S", "ReviewID": "R3D7Z2F7TO9IG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading countless reviews and evaluating prices, specs, etc, I finally took the plunge and bought my first 3DTV and (my first tv over 40 inches).

We sit probably 10 feet away and it looks/sounds great from this distance.+3D - Looks great, I've had tons of guests watch 3D with me, and everyone has had same reaction, \"WOW!\"; We love the glasses because they are not battery powered and love the fact that you can sit on a slight angle and still have a great viewing experience. We have played PS3 (something not done in at least a year), watched Planet Earth (2D-3D) and the DirecTV 3D channels. Everything looks beautiful but note it may not be the \"3D\" you are expecting with images popping out at you. It seems more of a depth effect where you feel like you can walk/look into the image of the TV.;; Glasses are cheap to replace too and if you buy during a promotion, they'll give you 6 additional to the 4 that come with the TV AND tons of micro-fiber cloths. This is more than enough and one can never have enough micro-fiber cloths.**Comment on 3D > I heard about 3D and most people, including myself thought it was a waste with the lackluster 3D programming. I have DirecTV and there are only 3 maybe 4 3D channels that seem to repeat most of the same programming.++2D TO 3D - best feature on the tv. Converted images look great and stunning; noone gets sick or uncomfortable. IT works with ANYTHING you feed it. computer, external video/dvd player, PS3, ANYTHING!+PICTURE QUALITY - absolutely picturesque and beautiful. I have a bright apartment (tons of sun) and this picture shines right through Day or night. ALSO, 2D HD and non-HD channels look great as well.+SOUND - TV is set up on stand (will be mounted on wall very soon) about 10 feet from the couch. We can hear it just fine, even without the bass or virtual surround sound, it is great for my apartment.+HDMI SWITCH - WOW, TV automatically switches to the recently powered input. This simply means that if you are watching your Cable/Satellite and you then turn on your PS3, the TV prompts you to switch to that input and its completed in seconds.+4 HDMI INPUTS - perfect amount for me and beats my old Samsung with only 2! Also conveniently located on the side of TV.+Internet/WIFI - a TV that gives itself software updates over the Internet? I was shocked, but it works. Setup with the included WIFI adapter took a couple minutes and I have had no connectivity issues.+APPS - The apps are cool but I don't use them as much. The MLB and Amazon apps are great and we watched both and experienced quality and speed. There is also a cool FM tuner app that allows you to listen to FM radio from all over the country.+MENUS/SETUP - Very easy to navigate and customize the TV to your liking. user friendly and fast.+PRICE - beats other TV's in this range especially in consideration of the features. I currently own 2 other TV's, both Samsung, and I am upset I didn't ditch them sooner for the LG. Quality, Design, Features, Price and 3D. Everything is better on LG.+COMPUTER MONITOR - I hooked up my Apple laptop via the display port to hdmi adapter and who would have guessed the LG also excelled as a computer monitor.====NEGATIVES====-APPS, PANDORA! -- I wish Pandora, a great music service available on your phone and other devices, was available on the TV :(-EXTRA WAND REMOTE -- I don't really see the purpose of this remote and don't like using it. It looks cool and egdy, but I find it much more convenient to use the old school remote/clicker.-It is taking me a long time to think of others, but this is it.OVERALL, if you want a 55 inch TV, are interested in 3D and this fits your budget, you will never look back at your purchase.

The panel is made using LG's FPR (Film-type Patterned Retarder) panel that is said to better focus the separate images being fed to the left and right eye. Passive 3D technology means the LW6500's uses polarized 3D glasses rather than the active shutter glasses used most 2010 3D TVs. These passive glasses require no batteries, weigh less and are far less expensive compared to their active counterparts.HD Picture Quality: 8.5/10LG is touting their new FPR panel as the first to 3D panel receive a \"Flicker Free Certification\" from Intertek and T\u00dcV. The 55LW6500 has another feature called \"3D Light Boost\" that uses a thin film over the panel to boost the brightness of 3D images. This is intended the counter the darkening effect of wearing 3D glasses to watch TV. From our viewing, this did indeed help present a better 3D image than the passive models without the light boost. Other notable picture features are Full HD 3D 1080p resolution, 240Hz Smooth Motion processing, LED local dimming and 2D to 3D conversion. We did note a big improvement when viewing the local dimming feature. This is edge-lit local dimming as opposed to the more impressive full array local dimming backlighting. LG televisions have expansive calibration and white balance controls that allow you to fine tune the picture to near perfect D6500K color temperature. There is also an intelligent sensor which adjusts room light. The TV needs to be set to Auto View mode, for it to work at its maximum level, however we don't recommend it due to some slightly noticeable change in lighting on the TV. It can be just a little distracting.3D TV Viewing: One of the great things about this TV is that it comes with 4 sets of passive 3D glasses (LGAG-P110) in the box. Colors and animation are vivid and of course, there is no flashing or flicker from the passive glasses to distract the viewer. The only drawback was some blurring in the bottom right and left corners of the screen. The 2D to 3D conversion feature is like most, not really good enough to want to use it.Standard Definition Picture Quality: 8/10We recommend using the Standard picture setting on the TV for standard definition programming which lifts contrast and color information and introduces too much blue. Changing the Color Temp setting to W8 resolves the blue push. There was some slight contouring and mapping of color information from the onboard video processors but overall SD picture performance was pretty solid.Features Rating: 8.5/10Internet Options through Built-In Wifi: LG NetCast Internet Connected Internet Feature Options: There are a few Internet options that appear to have been dropped from last years offering including Yahoo! Widgets and Skype. But other options have been expanded from the premium services Netflix, Youtube, VUDU, AP, Google Maps, Cinema Now, NBA, Facebook, and Twitter. There are around 20 premium services in all. Divided into 4 sections getting to content is quick and easy for users, pick from TV Live, Premium Content, Internet Apps or the Launch Bar and be watching online content faster than you could on past models There are currently 49 Apps in the LG Internet Apps store - not nearly as many as some competitors but the list is growing. A few we noticed include Yoga trainer, Horoscope, H&M; Fashion, Color Blind, and a Paint App. It appears LG is concertedly playing catchup in this area and doing a reasonably good job. You can also access the Picture menu options when using the Netcast SmartTV hub.Remote Control/Menu Functionality: The \"normal\" remote control that comes with the LW5700 series is black gloss and has a very nice design with a slight bubble slope to allow for one handed use of many functions. It is well laid out and easy to use. The menu has large understandable graphics that make the LW5700 enjoyable and easy to navigate. There are special keys on the remote control for Internet Widgets, and Premium Internet Services. The Q. menu key helps with quick toggling for major controls such as picture modes. There is also a new Energy Saving button on the remote in the event you would like the TV to go to an auto dimming mode.One of my favorite features for 2011 from all manufacturers is the fantastic Magic Wand Remote Control which this TV includes. Not only is it super cool, it is functional and practical and I prefer using it to even the very complete full remote that also comes with the LW6500. The styling is minimalistic and slim, narrowing toward the end like a pointer. It's main function is assisting in navigating the Internet options available on the TV, however where it can also save tons of time is typing on the full browser search function. It's a great little invention no doubt modeled after the Nintendo Wii mote.For the full review and more 3D TV Reviews please visit 3D TV Buying Guide", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stop overthinking this.....", "Author": "Dental profession", "ReviewID": "R2WKA34EO9MDLZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK. So I am not an EXPERT. I just want a very good product and price. I research things to the inth degree until I find what I want. Sooooo...this TV is GREAT!1)Shipping from Huppins was very fast.  Great instructions on accepting delivery and inspecting on arrival.(Did not get from Amazon due to 1 month wait time.)2) Set up was extremely easy. Stand swivels which is a plus. 3) Adjusting picture very easy if you follow the simple prompts. Adjust to your particular tastes. GREAT PICTURE!!!!NO BACKLIGHT BLEEDING THROUGH!! Do not overthink this! Great whites and blacks! For the average TV buyer, this is a great set. Everyday I say WOW...this picture is amazing. 4) Got the 3D version, because that seems to be the future.  Watched one movie so far and it is nice, but the 2D is so good, it does not matter.5)This is a SMART TV. Very easy internet connection. Everything is there...toggle and wireless connect easily to home router. SO SIMPLE! Just signed on for Netflix.  What more do you want? 6)Sound is better than average, so wait to hear before deciding on sound bar.  7)Get off the couch. Enjoy the outdoors!!

So I'm not speaking from \"experience\" (well at least not too much)I ordered this TV from Amazon.com on a Sunday and it arrived at my house on Friday, that's with the Free Super Saver shipping. So needles to say, I was quite pleased and surprised it arrived that quick. Kudos to Amazon.com for their shipping policies. Now on to the TV.The picture is great. I do see some of the LED \"edge lighting\" drawbacks (with uniformity issues) vs. a full array LED TV. But honeslty, for me, it's not that a big of a deal. The only time I notice the brighter edges is when I don't have a signal to the TV and the screen is completely black (except for that little LG spinning cube screen saver). While watching a tv show or movie, I don't notice it (the lack of uniformity) at all. But then again, I'm not a \"videophile\" either. I typically don't pixel peep my programs.I did get the 55\" version of this TV. The 65\" size of this model was $1,100 more at the time I ordered the 55LW6500 and I couldn't justify that much more of a cost to me.I did specifically want a 240Hz refresh rate. On my old Sharp Aquos, from to time to time, I would see \"pixel artifacts\" (especially during a high action scene). I thought the 240Hz would solve that problem. It has a little, but not by much. After doing more reading, research and looking at examples, I've come to learn that a lot of the pixel artifacts I see is probably due to the fact that my satellite provider (DirecTV) compresses the video that's sent to my box. I probably should've done more reading about it before I assumed the 240Hz rate would fix that issue. Even knowing that though, I still would have purchased the LW6500 over the LW5600 (120Hz).I do want to say that this TV has a MATTE screen, which is very important in my household considering we view this TV in a bright room. Kudos to LG for not sucumbing to glossy screens that seems so common with other LED TV manufacturers.This TV almost has too many options for me! Took me a while to actually learn what each option really does. After a few days, I was able to get my picture set to the way I want it.Also, I wanted to make sure that I got a TV with Auto Volume Leveling. This LG really exceeds in this aspect too! My older Sharp Aquos did NOT have auto volume leveling. Also, with the Sharp Aquos, dialogue was very low so we had to turn the volume up rather loud to hear it.... You guessed it, as soon as a commercial would come on, we had to leap for the remote to turn the volume down or we'd be blasted out of the house! I'm happy to say this LG COMPLETELY fixes this problem for us! Not only does this LG do a great job at auto leveling the volume, but it also has a setting (clear voice setting) to bring out dialogue a little more. Now we can hear what's being said and we don't have to reach for the remote at every commercial break. Heck, for us, that alone is worth the price of the TV!I've also noticed that the 55lw6500 is fast to \"boot up\" so to speak. Especially compared with old tube tvs (but even with my older LCD), it took a minute or so to warm up. This tv just takes a few seconds.Having the USB ports is nice too. I copied a home movie to a flash drive, plugged it into the TV and was able to watch it with no issues. I have a first generation Apple TV where I have home movies stored... but with LG's apps, internet connectivity, and the fact that I can just plug in an external hard drive... I don't think I need my Apple TV anymore! Also, this set is DLNA compliant, but I haven't tried it out yet.This TV has a pretty slim profile and small footprint (for a 55\" tv), the stand does swivel which is a nice bonus too.Really, the only negative thing I have to say so far (remember, I've only had the TV for a week), is it could use at least one extra, maybe 2 extra HDMI inputs (it has 4 HDMI inputs). Oh, and an RCA audio out. It does have audio out (to go to a receiver) but it's optical and not RCA. No biggie, an adapter can fix that for me.Oh, I did forget to mention that you can have different picture settings for each input. One setting for let' say HDMI 1 and another setting for HDMI 2, etc... That way, I don't have to adjust the picture constantly for different aspects of use (TV shows, sports, gaming, movies, or whatever)... that's a nice feature too.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC LG 3D 55\" LED TV", "Author": "Bocker", "ReviewID": "R3SYIOU7235QIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are considering purchasing a new TV, you would be making a HUGE mistake by not purchasing the LG 55LW6500 3D,LED,Internet Ready,240Hz,model. I just had mine delivered and set up by a neighborhood dealer and I am extremely pleased. This TV is simply magnificent. I love the passive 3D glasses ( my daughter accidently kept the 3D glasses from the last time we went to a movie theater and those glasses work on this TV), the matte screen which practically eliminates screen glare from my windows and lamps directly accross from  the TV. The picture quality is superb. I was watching a baseball game the other day and was able to see the pitchers cleat marks on the pitchers mound. Before you think, why the heck do I want to see cleat marks , I'm merely trying to illustrate how clear the picture is.  I had some questons about the operation of the TV that I could not find in the use and care manual, so I called LG customer service on Saturday. The rep that answered the phone was VERY helpful and solved all my issues. As a matter of fact, he spent an hour on the phone with me explaining the answer to every question I posed. He told me to call back anytime 24/7 and he'd be more than happy to assist. This is really unusual for a company to have this type of customer service without having to go thru a myriad of press 1 press 2 press 3 options. I am VERY impressed with LG. I will buy anything they make with that kind of customer service. I know this review was quite wordy and I apologize for taking so much of your time. Bottom line is: Don't wait another minute to BUY this TV NOW. I guarantee you will be depriving yourself of some of the best TV viewing EVER. The 3D picture is nothing less than movie theatre quality 3D.

I'll summarize some pros and cons below.Pros- works great in a room with lots of windows and ambient light (this is the main reason we picked this one Vs one with a coated screen that would glare)- very good picture quality in 2D mode, great color depth- SKYPE app works well (though the camera LG recommends is not very high quality, I wish I would have bought a better camera for it)- web features are great, especially Vudu, Hulu Plus, Netflix, Amazon Video, and 3D Demo. (I do not like YouTube on this TV though, see cons below for more on that)- the 2D to 3D feature actually works quite well in my opinion, and includes several customizations to improve it- native 3D (from 3D Blu-Ray's or Vudu 3D)adds a lot of depth back behind the screen, though I don't see many things come out of the screen (and I have adjusted all of the settings to try and bring things out more but have not found a way to have images project out from the TV very often)- came with four 3D glasses and replacement glasses are inexpensive- I like both of the remotes, and it is nice having two- large amount of user customizable settings- internet connectivity worked flawlessly for me and has been rock solid- very wide viewing angle, even for 3D. This is one of the big positives for this set.Cons- lots of light bleeding noticeable with dark content. This is especially noticeable at night, but not a deal breaker for me.- cheap base. Not an issue if you are wall mounting, but it seems like the base is just barely adequate for holding up the TV if you have it sitting on a platform or table- YouTube app is poorly done. It immediately starts a random video which may have f-bombs blaring before you can stop it. I can't see any way to stop this, so I don't use the TV for YouTube.- poor delivery through Pilot (seems like others have had good service, but Pilot lost my TV and I had to wait a couple weeks to get it, and the box was not in great shape when it arrived)- 240Hz: honestly I can't notice any improvement from this Vs the 120Hz of the model below this one. It would have been just as good to buy the cheaper one I think.- sounds is not great, and even with a sound bar it is not wonderful, but is acceptable. I wish the optical out was variable and not fixed volume.- quirky software: sometimes the sound gets muted when switching from one input to another, just have to push mute a couple times to fix- lags in gaming, but I am not an avid gamer anymore so this is not a big deal to meOverall I am happy with the TV, though I wish it did not have the white light bleeding so bad. I guess this is the trade off for great performance in high ambient light situations. I really like Vudu and watching the 3D movie trailers of all of the 3D movies Vudu offers.

I wish my experience with LG had been good, but it has turned into a nightmare.  I was really looking forward to watching my new 3D LG 55LW6500, but immediately after set-up the TV did not work correctly.  Turning on the TV only produced sound, but no picture.  After turning the TV off and on again, did the picture finally come in.  The situation only got worse after a couple of weeks and the TV would need to be cycled on & off several times in order to produce a picture.  I contacted LG and they talked me through an extensive diagnostics check over the phone.  Once completed, LG decided I needed a repair tech to come service my  month old TV.  The repair tech from an independant vendor (super nice & professional)concluded that the panel would need to be replaced.  He ordered the part and informed me he would contact me as soon as the part came in from LG.  Three and a half weeks later, the part finally arrived from LG and what I thought was just a small 'mother-board' panel, turned out to be the entire 55\" panel.  Almost everything was being replaced with this panel replacement, which was fine - as long as the TV worked properly.  Sure enough, the next day the TV produced the same problem - I had to cycle on & off until the picture came on.  I contacted LG again and was treated very poorly.  I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and was treated even worse by the supervisor.  LG will NOT replace my defective TV.  They do NOT care how many times it needs to be serviced, they told me the only thing I could do was to accept the TV the way it was or to have it serviced.  The LG supervisor said it was not her concern how many days I needed to take off work in order to have the TV serviced.  The repair tech has been here 4 times now and the TV still does not work properly.  I did not buy this TV in order to get a 'NEW' TV replacement a month later; nor did I buy this TV to have it serviced 4 times in 2 months.  All I want is a TV that works like it should and a company that cares about their customers.  FYI- don't even get me started on my LG dryer that has been replaced once and repaired twice in 18 months.

The day before delivery I googled the words \"amazon tv pilot delivery\" and came across a few threads filled with horror stories regarding Pilot.  I'm in Houston Tx.  I had no problems.  It appears service quality for Pilot varies from city to city.  I had a 9-12 delivery window.  They showed up at 12:30.  They never called to confirm delivery but I was tracking the shipment via their website and the morning of delivery I could see the status change to \"on truck for delivery\" so I didn't sweat it.  I wanted to set the tv up myself (they are delivery guys not tv specialists) so I just checked the tv for damage while they waited (there was none) and then let them go on their way.SetupMounting the stand was tricky.  The manual says to lay the tv on a flat surface to attach the stand.  The only way I found this can be accomplished was to lay the tv on the edge of my bed, attached the stand, carefully lower the tv to the floor then carry it to the living room.  I was able to do this all by myself but the carrying part was difficult.  The tv's weight was not a problem, it's the size that makes it tricky to carry.  As I mentioned in a earlier post, I used my Avia DVD to calibrate settings.  I did not like any of the preset modes.Features:2D->3D conversion isn't perfect.  In my opinion it provides very little 3D effect.Trumotion:  When turned on motion blur is almost non-existent but I keep this feature turned off (but I keep Real Cinema setting on) because it makes motion look too fluid.  It's as if people in movies are moving under water.2D: Stunning picture.  SD doesn't look as good as it did on my old Sony LCD projection tv but it is satisfactory.3D: I haven't had a chance yet to watch any 3D content.Magic motion remote:  I use it in conjunction with the regular remote.  It makes for quicker navigation of the menus.I have barely had this tv for a week so that is all I can comment on for now.  I'll update this review as time goes on.  Be sure to use high quality HDMI cables when you can.  I use 24AWG cables from monoprice.com that support 3D, high speed, arc, and deep color.

And let me just say it looks darn good out the box, but some tweaking will still be required to get the best picture.. Talk about features.. There are tons of adjustments to this tv, which may not sit well with those who aren't into \"too many choices\".  Good thing this set comes with a few pre-sets that are pretty decent.This one of LG's flagship \"Smart tv/3D\" sets.  Meaning the tv can hookup to your home network and also has apps.  You do the usual face booking, Netflix, amazon instant video and more right from your couch or bed.  There are plenty of apps to choose from as well. The tv has a LAN port on the back as well as a wireless option (wireless dongle included with the 47lw6500 model. Not sure about other models) so u can go wireless if u chose.  But due note going wireless may not give you the best performance if your into streaming video from your home network or Netflix (More on that later)This tv has a 240hz refresh rate and will do well for movies for movie buff.  I here it's not so good for gamers (me) who play a lot of games online, have yet to try that.  This unit come with a Magic Remote (similar to the nintendo wii-mote) that acts as a pointer to navigate around. Though u can use the standard remote, the magic mote is much faster at navigating around settings, some may not like the idea of 2remotes, but trust me, u will love the magic mote when navigating through menus.Like I mentioned above, you can also stream videos from your home network. But they do have to be in a certain format to play (may be a setback for video philes)This tv happens to also do 3D. For me it was just an added bonus and not the reason I bought the tv.  The 3D is passive (same non-powered glasses you get in the movie theaters) and are comfortable and actually offer a good 3D quality to not be active shutter (batter powered glasses).  This unit also has a 3D trick up it's sleeve.  It can give a 3D effect to standard 2D video, by give the background the illusion of more depth and making what's in the foreground stand out, actually pretty impressive.This set does have a few flaws, the blacks aren't as \"Black\" as some of the Samsung LED models out there (actually returned one of those and got this unit) but not to a point where it's a deal breaker.  There is also a ton of menus and sub-menus this may turn some people off like I said. The stand feels a tad bit flimsy, makes me a tad bit nervous, but the tv hasn't fallen yet (praying it doesn't).Some may be wondering why I would return a beautiful Samsung for this set.  The Samsung was 120hz and 40\"... The unit I got is 47\" and 240hz I may not notice a difference on the screen but I saved money and got a free xbox to boot (saved $200 or so)...I also haven't noticed a difference between 120hz vs 240hz, so if you see a deal on a 120hz set and think your missing out, you can breath a sigh of relief as there is little to no difference in picture quality.  But if your are into the 3d there will be a difference, because the 120hz doesn't refresh as fast (120hz vs 240hz) 240hz unit does and may cause what is known as ghosting (effect where object has a blur or trail behind or in front of it). Also a huge difference coming from 60hz setThis the best tv I've ever owned...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit (11/27/2011): When I first reviewed this tv I said: \"Like I mentioned above, you can also stream videos from your home network. But they do have to be in a certain format to play (may be a setback for video philes)\".  There is a \"My Media\" app that you can use and it links to Plex media server, which means you can drop your digital videos there and they will do the transcoding for you.  It seems pretty snappy so far.  And there is other video content there as well, such as Revision 3, and other online media channels.The audio has been sporadic since receiving a firmware update (This is a Smart Tv so yep there are firmware updates), when I first received the unit the audio was good out the box, now it seems to be kinda wonky.  I fiddled with the different settings but still can't get it back to the way it was out of the box... Hopefully another firmware update will rectify this...

I can't wait for my 3D Blu-ray player to arrive to play 3D content!  The options menu and wand remote are pretty easy to use.  However, I wish LG had some kind of QWERTY keyboard to use for typing as that is my only complaint so far (minus one star).  It's just hard to type anything into the search fields, say for Netflix or any other area--reminds me of texting on my first cell phone where you have to hit the one button 3 times get the correct letter. Beyond that though the TV is excellent.  The colors and blacks are excellent. I turned up the refresh rate all the way up to 240 Hz and the clarity is crazy. Keeps up with motion blur like you wouldn't believe.  All around, this TV is an excellent buy for $1,197.00.  The TV apps are pretty sweet, only really used Netflix so far though.

Internet WiFi via the included USB WiFi adaptor. Wired network connector also on this set. The new wand navigator works and is fun to operate. This TV looks bigger than 55\". I also have a panasonic 65\" plasma (non 3D) TV, and this 55\" looks nearly as big as the 65\". LG really makes a nice TV, and the passive 3D using the very affordable passive 3D glasses, looks great and as good as my active 3D 47\" LG TV. So much nicer and easier using passive 3D system and glasses. No battery or connection loss between TV and glasses on this passive system, as we had with the battery 3D glasses and the active system. Until they make a eye-glass-less 3D screen, the passive 3D system is the way to go. Lots of internet apps, lots of features. First class 3D TV!!! Plus NON-REFLECTIVE screen on the 55LW6500\" models. BestBuy had the 55LW5600 model but the 5600 model frame rate is 120.The 6500 model is 240 frame rate. The only main difference between the two models I believe. LG got this one right.

Then I watched a 3D movie on the newer LG.  Holy cow.  It was clear-- no blurriness.  I played the same 3d movie on both and isolated the blurriness on the 240hz model.  Then I swapped out each component one at a time to see if the problem was the tv or the DVD player, the glasses, or perhaps even the HDMI cable.  It was the tv.  LG sent service out to the house and they replaced the main board.  No change.  The Tv also does not auto power on when a dvd begins to play as my two other LGs do (I have a 52 inch LG as well).  Don't know whether that is a defect or simply a design difference.  The tech said he would talk to LG.  Has not gotten back to me yet.  I would not have even thought there was a problem with the 3D if I had not bought the different model and noticed a big difference.  So if your 3D experience on this tv is blurry, you may also have a problem.  Update: Called the tech, LG stated that there was nothing more that could be done as the main board was replaced.

I have owned it for a little over a month now, and I honestly can't find anything wrong with it.  I was in the market last month to replace my two year old Samsung LCD TV.  I really wanted a LED TV, one with internet connect-ability, and researched for several weeks.  I was never in the market for 3D at all.  I had always thought that the whole 3D thing was a fad and that 3D at home was kind of lame.  Boy was I wrong!  I decided on this TV for two reasons....price and reviews.  When this TV arrived it came within 3 days of purchase by a private courier.  When I opened the box I was amazed by how slim and refined the TV was.  It was super thin but yet had substantial build quality to it...I wish I could same about the included stand.  The stand was a little on the flimsy side, being made out of thin plastic vs glass.  Not a deal breaker though.  The set-up was simple enough. I am fortunate that my router is located fairly close to the TV location, so I plug my Ethernet cable directly vs fumbling with the WiFi adapter(included).  Immediately when I turned the TV on with the internet already connected it ran me through the settings as well as did a firmware update. Once the set-up was completed (about 10 mins) I was ready to go.  Once I had all my devices connected HD cable box/3D Blu-ray/Surround Sound receiver, I was amazed by the features this TV  had and above all the PICTURE!  I had already purchased the Avatar 3D bluray and when I put on one of the 4 pairs of 3d glasses that came with the TV, I was immediately immersed in the Avatar 3d universe, all from the comfort of my own home.  The 3d effects where amazing and being closer to the screen than in the theater made it seem more life like.

I had been looking at different TVs for a while and came across an ad for the newer LG passive 3D TVs.  I started looking closer at this TV and fell in love with some of the features.  For me the biggest selling point was the fact that it uses passive 3D technology.  No longer do you need to use those expensive and heavy active 3D glasses.  I received 4 passive glasses for free that are nearly identical to the glasses you would get at the movie theatre.  As an added benefit the 6 pair of movie theatre glasses I had already work with this TV.  I can invite family and friends over and we can all enjoy watching a 3D movie.I also want to comment on the 2D to 3D upscale feature.  Using this feature you can upscale any normal 2D TV show or movie to 3D.  The TV allows you to adjust the depth of the 3D effect for your viewing.  The upscale feature works great with any program but if you upscale high-definition the effect is awesome.  My kids love watching things in 3D.  I can't wait for football season (hopefully we have one this fall) to watch some high-definition football in 3D.Another cool feature is the fact that it is internet ready and comes pre-loaded with many links/apps for Facebook, Netflix, etc already on the system and ready to go.I can't really comment on the sound capabilities of the system because I have an surround sound entertainment system that is used for all audio.The wand that comes with the TV is similiar to using the Wii remote.

My Samsung uses active shutter glasses, and I find it creates a lot of eye strain.  The Vizio set was light years better for me.  I returned the Vizio for the LG and was shocked.  The LG, also passive, had a much better picture than the Vizio and the matt finish screen eliminated all of my glare problems.  I am completely sold on this set and highly recommend it.  I also play adventure games on it and find no problem with lag.  It may be an issue for more precise shooters, but it appears perfectly suited to gaming to me.

Holloway", "ReviewID": "R3O9TKPRC4R2PK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV to finally upgrade my 720p to 1080p with a bigger screen and 3D.  With that said, this is my first 3D tv, 1080p tv, and one of this size, if that matters for this review.It's definitely a good size, although I'm already used to it and it no longer feels large (if I want LARGE, I pop over to my projector).  The picture is excellent and viewing angle excellent.  As a new user of 3D, it's alright.  I was actually a little disappointed, but perhaps my expectations were set too high for this.  I haven't actually used other 3D TVs so I cannot compare, but the quality really varies on this TV I think.  I thought I'd use the 2D to 3D conversion more than I actually do, since I didn't plan on buying a lot of 3D content.  However, it doesn't make the content look that different from standard 2D and forces me to wear the glasses (granted, they are light and easy to wear, but as I don't wear glasses normally I'm just not used to it).  However, 3D specific content is a lot better.  I watched Avatar 3D as my first one as HBO had it available, and it was absolutely gorgeous.  Other 3D specific movies are good as well, although it does vary from movie to movie.  For example, I just tried Green Lantern 3D and actually did a 3D to 2D conversion on it - the 3D just wasn't working for me and gave me a headache.  Perhaps I could adjust some TV settings as I haven't played with them all that much.  I like the passive 3D as the glasses are far cheaper (I have 10 pairs now - something no active shutter 3D TV owner can say) and they all came bundled with the TV / amazon promotion they had going on.  They are lighter and battery free, which is also good.  I did own some active shutter 3D glasses for the projector (although I never got them working with it), and I can say these types of glasses are far superior to wear.  But anyways, the 3D wasn't the top reason for buying the TV, and it's still good for 3D specific content.The TV is light and thin, and comes with a table mount that swivels - I wasn't expecting the swivel but it's pretty useful.I'm not a huge fan of the 'magic motion' menu or whatever they call it.  It just requires an extra remote and I just prefer standard remotes.  However, it's not really needed to use that, as there is also another menu that is almost identical and uses the first remote with buttons.  I'm not a huge fan of the first remote either - I don't like the direction buttons as they feel strange to click.  But, who buys a TV for the remote?  If you get this TV, buy yourself a logitech harmony - you'll be glad you did.Overall, it's a good TV and I'm happy with the purchase.  Amazon lists it for reasonable prices.  For similar price, you could grab a TV from your local retailer of the same size without 3D or perhaps without being LED.  However, I have yet to see a 3D LED 55\" 1080 240hz TV for this price anywhere else (I did see that some retailers do have the old 120hz model on sale now as the holiday season is coming up).", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "BEST TV EVER!!!!", "Author": "Gamer090", "ReviewID": "R2EU6EIIYJLL9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is simply AMAZING.

My fix about sound quality?? Connected the Optical OUT of this gem to my Logitech Z-5500 THX-Certified 5.1 worth over $500. Another world now.- My only complaint? The pedestal of the TV. LG clearly put so much effort and core-engineering into this device that even though the base is definitely sleek it is also definitely flimsy. However after going through magnitude 6.0 earthquake last month and TV withstood the event pretty well I have to re-evaluate the engineering of this TV support as well.

Samsung TV came with two sets of Red Wine-colored rechargeable active 3d glasses. WiFi-ready then, but no WiFi Dongle, but samsung USB HDD. At the store, then, the salesperson comapred Samsung and LG next to each other.  I find Samsung TV is slightly brighter and image more crisp, and, more stylish with the aluminum leg, and that made me close the deal then. Samsung technicians came and installed the TV and made sure I understood how to use all the features.After 1.5 years later, when I have this LG, This LW6500 model, its sound is slight clearer and its menu more comprehensive and well-featured, with WiFi Dongle(usb). But the image is darker, NOT dimmer, the WiFi connection only took 2-3 min. And, understanding all the feature only took 45min of fiddling with the remote.LG provides 2 remotes.One for everyday use, the other, simplified version, just like Nintendo Wii remote, you swing it aiming at the screen, and input letters for sign-in movie Apps,including LG ones.you can download more apps up to 256mb internal storage. Each app downloading requires less than 10mb.______________I'd like to address the list below as some issues, which I want to share with other shoppers;1. [The location setting] only comes with limited big cities in USA, and does not cover many  others. I wish they allow us to register with actual town locations, with zip codes. Same with some of LG Apps.2. [Automatic time setting] feature doesn't work with mine and I had to manually punch in the right local time. (somebody let me know if you resolve your same issue later, please)3. [Closed Caption font size] is too small and I cannot see the letters easily but the upside of it is, your TV viewing is not interrupted by the caption blocks either.4. [\"Home or Premium\" buttons on the remote- NO 'DELETE' KEY] lead to the features like internet movie sites, like Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Vudu, CinemaNow, MOG, and youtube, twitter, skype, accuWeather.com, MVB.tv that require you to sign-in. It means, lots of swing motions and clicks to put every single letter, but, with NO 'DELETE' key button if you make a typo error! Any mistake will result in retyping letters from the start. For example, to log-in amazon prime, it took 20min, I felt a lot of stress putting in my email address using magic remote(still slightly faster if you are used to beam it correctly to screen keyboard). The frequent push on \"Enter\" button really hurt my untrained thumb joint. No DELETE key, and awkward Enter button in your hand is something you will not like about LG design.5. [attaching the wrist strap on magic remote] is another design flaw. I had to open the battery back cover on the bottom, and, I had to guide the strap loop with a needle.6. [pixelated/mosaic images in some channels, with my comcast] My subscription of comcast digital does not fully match with this LG TV. Currently, the screen shows pixelated mosaic images and some freezing images sporadically with some of local, and, extended digital channels, awaiting Comcast techinican's visit. I did not have this problem with Samsung. (if any other user also resolved this issue, let me know how to fix it, please!)7.[3D glasses] I do not have 3d DVDs yet, so I tested 3D with 3D movie titles from comcast network, and, just regular  2D->3D feature testing with HBO, Showtime channels. They work smoothly,  but, when I take off the 3D glasses, the stress I had was slightly more intense than Samsung's. It feels like you tried the strong prescribed glasses for the first time. This is something I should get used to. BUT, Samsung glasses darkens the image as if there is a grey haze in the room a bit. Now,The flimsy 3D glass colors. It came with two boxes of two pairs, one white and one orange color each. We are all grownups in my household. And, it felt cheap by just opening the boxes. They work, nevertheless.8. [poor packaging] Mine came with all two bottom corners shredded open. Although the trucking company might be responsible, it looked like someone sent us an open-box item. LG chose to use recycled paper mold to secure the screen inside the box, it did not endure the handling on the road, perhaps, and, I was very nervous of any damage on TV when we unpacked the TV.9. [installing TV stand] Unlike the guide manual, you  will have to put the provided bubble cushions on monitor, with another person tilting and floating the not-so-light screen so that you can actually screw the base in an angled position. I would suggest doing it on the bed, not on a hard floor. Otherwise, you might accidentally scratch the top edge, before even you put it back upright.______________ I know it sounds too long a list. But, listing these issues would, at least, will give you some ideas of what you will have to deal with. Although their design is not all perfect, I am very happy with the purchase. Actually, I enjoy it as much as I enjoy my Samsung; Both Samsung and LG's 240hz, 1080p LED HDTVs are top-range products from two different companies, two different approaches in technology, and designs.

They don't. The picture is great, the 3D is really cool and the TV end of it is the best we've had, but all the browsing and wireless connection to our home network-- it fails and fails BIG TIME! Customer support via chat on line took 2 hrs, 23 minutes and 54 seconds to try to help me yesterday, and spent about a half hour prior to that several days ago and hasn't even responded to my chat posts yet today. The TV kept popping up a message saying that there was a newer version of the software available, yet when I told it to download it, it couldn't do it. It would get about two-thirds through and just quit. Customer support finally admitted that LG had a lot of reports of the same problem and they told me that I had to download it from my computer to a thumb drive. The thumb drive had to be completely empty of all other files, they said. I had to make a special trip to go buy a new one so I wouldn't louse up files on the one I had. So I went back to their web site-- no update available on there. I chatted, they said they were uploading an update to the web site, finally. It took hours. I loaded it on the thumb, then to the TV and lo and behold, the TV had miraculously downloaded the file all by itself after nagging us for about a week-- I hadn't even needed to purchase the thumb drive or mess with the download from the computer. But the update did nothing to make any of the junk work. Browsing is worthless. Look at photos using the network to access them from my hard drive-- no way, takes forever and half the files aren't even there. It doesn't access the whole computer, just photos, videos, music and play lists. And none of them work. Most of the free programs that LG puts on there are worthless or ads, like the Toyota Camry ad. The pay stuff is probably ok, but we don't use it because we have Signature Home from Time Warner and can order a movie if we were so inclined. We have plenty of speed and connectivity on our home network, but the TV doesn't use it for the file access to our computer.Save your money, but a less expensive LED TV, none of this high-tech BS works. LG should be ashamed of its very poor customer support. The question remains, why did they even bother with all this junk when it doesn't work? To entice suckers like me, that's why.

Young", "ReviewID": "R2L8ZP4Z0PZYL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There's no way you will dislike this television. Impossible. Even if you tried to nit-pick, there's no way your conclusion would be to go to another TV. The bottom line is that, if you're looking for high-end features and picture quality in both 2D and 3D, you absolutely will love this TV.WHY I CHOSE THIS TV OVER OTHERS:I saw the review on Consumer Reports that placed it as an extremely close second overall TV behind the $3000 high end Bravia-- at HALF the price. And it was ranked #1 in 3D. I own a Samsung and replaced a Sony, so this is my first LG. I absolutely LOVE IT. It uses edge-lighting and local dimming to produce crisp, high contrast colors and black levels. That's the latest and more expensive technology you can buy. There is a slightly newer local dimming tech that is marginally better-- but you won't notice or care, especially since it's TWICE as expensive.The TV is maybe an inch / inch and a half thick and looks great from an industrial design standpoint.PICTURE QUALITY:It's black levels are BLACK-- contrast is excellent and you don't see dark gray where black should be. In fact, the black levels are so good that I really can't distinguish them from the bezel.2D television was great. The TV comes in Eco Mode, so I punched it up to \"default\" to get a higher brightness and contrast ratio. However, I did very little else so make the TV look superb. Contrast was excellent and colors were saturated but not too saturated. If you prefer other settings, there are defaults for all types of viewing scenarios, plus feature-by-feature custom settings that you can save as your own custom setting.3D PICTURE QUALITY (Advantages of Passive 3D):I found this TV's passive 3D to be very effective. The effect was pronounced and worked very well. And, unlike a shutter display system, my eyes did not become fatigued after watching a movie. I tried Tron Legacy 3D and I jumped out of my seat in a couple spots. Passive 3D means you don't need a shutter to flick on and off to make the 3D effect, which also means the glasses are cheap, light, and do not require batteries. This set comes with 4 pair and extras are super affordable.GAMING:This TV also worked great for gaming. I tried it with both 2D and 3D games on my PS3. The PS3 recognized my TV and switched it into 3D mode when I told it to, which is awesome. There are settings for \"game\" in the display presents, but I did not find them necessary. To address a concern one reviewer had with \"lag\"-- I saw none. Lag is usually caused with some of the motion-flow effects the TV uses when you watch TV or blu-rays to reduce motion between frames. This adds latency, or \"lag,\" to games but is imperceptible when watching a movie. But I did not perceive this at all, because I had set the TV to know that the #2 HDMI input was a game system. If you do this, you should never need to fiddle with anything. It's possible early TV's didn't have this feature, but mine certainly does. Since your TV updates it's software and firmware over the internet with the supplied WiFi dongle (or Ethernet,) you will always have the latest features. So don't worry about ordering one the doesn't ship with the latest software, because it will just update the first chance it gets anyway.APPS AND OTHER FEATURES:The apps seem fun enough, and in the case of the TV services such as Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and others, you could use this set as a stand alone entertainment device. I happen to have a PS3, so I didn't need them, but the implementations were easy to use (I tried Netflix and a couple other apps.)The TV comes with a Wii-like controller for games and pointing. I have not used it much but there is great potential here. There are games and other features you can use it with, and the quality is a mixed bag. With time, this could become better. It's a neat feature with promise.CONCLUSION:Buy it.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "55LW6500 Great TV !!!!", "Author": "Mark Nichols", "ReviewID": "R1PQLA70WTGULJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this TV in excellent condition.

The sound is much better than on my 3 year old Vizio. Plus I have a sound bar so it is just that much better now. It is so intuitive for an electronics moron like myself. I can honestly say I have never enjoyed TV so much. Thumbs up to you LG and thumbs up to Amazon for selling it to me at such a great price with the 6 free glasses bundle on top of the 4 free ones that came with the TV. Another plus is I have a pair of real 3D glasses I kept the last time I saw 3D at the movies and they work great with this Tv.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "An excellent 3D HDTV", "Author": "mrgagne", "ReviewID": "R3GAHC9ER42OY6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the LG 47\" 3D HDTV looking for a good quality 3D set at an affordable price.

So when I heard about the new 3D TV,s That had come, out And their cost I had no interest in them. While shopping for other things on Amazon, I ran across some 3D units and I  desided to check them out and read some reviews. After reading the reviews my interest intensfied but with the cost of the units plus the high prices of 3D glasses I started to loose interest again. A few months later I saw this \"NEW\" LG Infinia 55 Cinema 3D LW6500 1080p 240Hz Led HDTV  at Amazon, and at a special price. I read all the Data I could on it. I was impressed with what I read so I purchased it. Believe me, I am so happy that I bought this unit. The picture is beautiful, the 3D is fantastic, the on line aps and games keeps my wife's total interest. ( so that makes me happy because it kind of keeps her off the shopping channels, some what.) The biggest and most important change in this \"NEW\" 3D TV (in my openion) is the \"GLASSES\" technology. Number one is the cost,very inexpensive, number two, We can watch 3D from any angle in the room and see perfect 3D. Including lying down on the couch or sitting reclined in a recliner. Yes this is the new technology, and I believe other manufacturers are going to go in this direction very soon. Maby that's why we see so many of the older 3D models drasticly reduced in stores and on line.

I was at Best Buy and saw the passive 3-D on display and was completely blown away, I also loved the fact that this is one of the few televisions released by any manufacturer this year that has a matte screen, I have lots of large windows in my den and I can't deal with the glossy mirrors that Sony, Samsung and Panasonic insist on releasing.The problem with this television, and what is just about inherent in all LCD and LED technology, is the bleeding of light around the edges, MURA (clouding and flashlights) and terrible uniformity of white light on black screens.  I uploaded a photo to see: the backlight was all the way down to 30, brightness and contrast were brought down and the LED dimmer was turned on and off (made no difference), and there is terrible light leaking around the edges, and in the bottom right corner some terrible blooming.  During the day this is acceptable, but at night it's very distracting and annoying, especially when watching a dark movie like Apocalypse Now or The Dark Knight.  My first LCD TV in 2007 had the same exact problem, and I'm amazed manufacturers can release these units with such poor uniformity.  I am by no means a videophile, but if I'm spending $2k of my hard earned money, I don't want a television that has light leakage issues.So I decided to return this unit, get some black out curtains and just bite the bullet and buy a Panasonic plasma VT30 for $500 more, same 55\" size.  When I receive it I'll do a comparison, I've come to the conclusion that glossy screens and probably plasma technology in general are going to give a better picture with deeper blacks and none of these issues.

I cannot get rid of the lag. I have read over and over about people getting rid of their lag by changing the AV mode. Let me tell you, it doesn't work. From my perspective, there still is lag. Too much lag??  Watch this video and you be the judge.The video shows a headset coming straight from the Xbox.  The Xbox also had an HDMI hooked from the Xbox into the TV.  So audio and video were output at the same time from the Xbox to both the headset and the TV. Ideally, when the gun is fired, you should hear it on the TV and the headset simultaneously. Unfortunately, you will see that there is some delay before it hits the TV. This is a big deal when you're trying to shoot someone before they shoot you.  If what you see on the TV is 1/2 of a second late, your scores will suffer.[...]SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!  I don't want to have to return the TV.Thanks.UPDATE:  Here's what I found are the best settings.INPUT: HDMIAV Mode:  GamePicture Mode: GameInput Label: PCWITH THESE SETTINGS I OBTAINED AN INPUT LAG OF 76 ms. Yes! That's right, 76 ms.  Honestly, I feel like that's a bit low from how it feels. I expected to be easily over 100 ms.  If anyone want's details on the lag test, let me know.FURTHER UPDATE:  I have contacted LG customer support. Wow, try explaining what \"lag\" is to a support tech. That's an exercise in frustration. They wanted to send a tech to my house to service the TV. I found it funny that they think the TV can actually be fixed. I also find it unbelievable that LG is not aware of this issue. Seriously! How could anyone make a TV these days with such crazy lag?I have decided to return the TV.  Since this TV was purchased primarily for the XBox, the lag is unacceptable. My kids have not stopped complaining about the TV since we got it. Not what I would have expected from this TV.Honestly, I cannot see how people say there is no lag with this TV. I don't think they fully understand what \"lag\" is. Lag is defined as the time period that the Xbox outputs the signal to the time when the signal is displayed. This TV easily has 73 ms of lag.  You will actually see a person in a game 73 ms after they see you.If you do not play FPS games at home, GET THIS TV.  If, however, you plan on playing XBox / PS3 FPS games, DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT get this TV.  Anyone who tells you there is no lag is just plain wrong. The lag is easily 76 ms, probably more. You can adjust all the settings you want, about 76 ms is all you're going to get.  I feel anything above 25 ms is unacceptable.Now, why would people say there is no lag?  I figure they think \"lag\" is a non-sync of voice and video.  Or, they are just going by \"feel\" when they press a button on a controller, and see the display react. They may think there is no lag, but do not really perceive the 76 ms delay.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "DONT BUY THIS TV.

It's advertised as a Smart TV, and, well, it's not that smart. The concept is still in its infancy. Nevertheless, I give it five stars because (a) other TVs aren't necessarily smarter, (b) as a TV it's outstanding, and (c) the price was right (under one grand as of January 2012). Here are a few complaints about its smartness (i.e. Internet capabilities) before I extoll its virtues. My wireless network is quite fast (15Mbps) but, unlike my laptop, this TV takes a very long time to load a YouTube video (many never load at all) or pictures of the movies on my Netflix queue.  Looks like I'll have to drill some holes and run the Ethernet cable across the house. Hopefully it'll raise its IQ by a notch. Some apps are rather Spartan: YouTube, for example, has only one function, and that is search the video you want to watch by keywords. That's it. Some reviewers complain that YouTube always starts with a random video that may contain profanities. True. But again, by the time that video loads (if it ever loads), I am already in the search function. Also the magic motion remote (which by the way works very well) has only a few buttons, and one of them is a big \"MUTE\" button. If you are scared of that random video dropping f-bombs on you, why not hit the \"mute\" button which, I measured, is only 1-3/4\" away from the \"enter\" button, the one used to make selections, and can be conveniently reached with one swipe of the thumb? Another app that is totally Spartan is Google Maps. The only thing you can do is look up some address in map or satellite view.  Forget about looking up directions. Internet Browser is yet another example. Other than the dial-up-like speed, it also has a hopelessly obsolete Adobe Flash Player rendering it virtually useless. And you thought you would be able to just go to the YouTube website, huh? The AccuWeather app is another nice thought but utterly useless. It's so enriching to know about the weather in five major cities in the world (London, New York, Paris, Tokyo, Moscow), isn't it? Yes, you can only choose five and only from major cities (not just the closest big city to you). For example, the whole state of Arkansas is represented by one city--Little Rock. So, clearly, LG software engineers designed a lot of these apps just for appearance and not for any useful purpose. And hey, I'd be willing to pay extra for some functional apps. Ironically, at first I was concerned about LG not supplying a remote with a built-in QWERTY keyboard, like some competitors do, because I was picturing myself texting and surfing the Web with this TV... yeah, right :-) Having said this, Netflix and Skype work very well. Moreover, LG Netflix app has something the actual Netflix website doesn't have! A lot of times Netflix instant video is not widescreen, which is quite annoying. I don't know how they do it, but on this TV it is always widescreen, and it doesn't appear stretched or cropped. Skype is very functional (you have to buy LG Skype camera), too, even more so than the original Skype application. But remember, it's for video and phone calls only (no texting). Despite what other reviewers stated, LG does have some pretty good free apps. They have a whole travel series, which takes you to some of the most famous tourist destinations in the world in 3D, so it feels like you are physically there! Well, unfortunately, the video stops every 30 seconds to buffer, but I hope to solve that with a hard-wired Internet connection. Apparently, that's the only way to go (the magic motion remote manual also warns you that it won't work if you have your wireless router in a couple foot radius). With hard-wired Internet and hopefully LG people gradually releasing some no-nonsense apps, this TV will be nearly perfect. And let me reiterate: the most important apps such as Netflix or Skype are already working perfectly even with wireless Internet connection. Not once did I have a problem streaming an HD movie from Netflix. Amazon Instant Video does seem to hesitate just a little.And now for the TV itself. It looks great. It's fast. The picture is great. Even local channels in standard definition do not look as pixelated as I'm used to seeing on such large screens. Compared to all the TVs I've seen on display at Wal-Mart (yes, I know those are \"watered down\" versions of brand names but this TV was in the same price range), this LG has the best picture hands down. The TrueMotion feature does make motion realistic (a little unusual at first). The light sensor works well, although I have to agree that in a completely dark room, the picture gets too dark. The sound is surprisingly adequate, and I no longer have the problem where sound effects are very loud but the speech is almost inaudible. It easily recognizes whatever you hook up to it. I start my Blu-Ray player (which is an older Sony), and the TV automatically turns on and starts playing the disk. All the menus are super easy to understand and navigate through. After reading some reviews, I was trying very hard to find backlight bleeding along the edges but couldn't see any (I can see it on my computer monitor so I know what it looks like). The 3D feature is by far the most amazing. It's one of the very few TVs on the market that utilizes passive 3D technology, and it works very well. Just remember to choose the correct viewing angle (perpendicular to your eyes) and distance (about 6 times the height of your TV). It also converts 2D to 3D, which very few other TVs can do. And because regular 3D is a little hard on your eyes, I find it much more comfortable to watch a high quality HD movie converted into 3D. It's not popping out of the screen, but adds just enough dimensions to make it a pleasant viewing experience. For the peace of mind, I purchased a 5-year in-home extended service warranty from LG offered through Amazon. It was even cheaper and longer than Square Trade. I can highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "NO AUDIO OUT", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R32PY60IDUV56K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got his TV today. The reviews for the picture are spot on. This is a great tv. However, I have a hearing issue and I use wireless headphones so I don't have to have the sound turned up so loud that it shakes the house. This TV DOES NOT have an audio out hook up. It does have a hook up for headphones but you guessed it, with the head phones hooked up it kills ALL sound including the home theater. That means no sound for anyone in the room but me and my headphones. I have to have the tv so loud no one else can stand to be in the house or I have to put the captions on and just listen to mush.I'm very disappointed with the lack of the audio out hook up. I'm afraid I'm going to be sending this back unless some bright soul out there can come up with a solution for me. It's too bad as the TV is truly truly outstanding in every other aspect. For me it's a deal breaker as there is really no way for me to enjoy this TV without my headphones. Anyone with a hearing problem knows that stereo TV through hearing aids is a joke.I'm just posting this so if anyone else has a similar problem be forewarned!!!!! I did talk to LG and they said that anyone who uses headphones doesn't want the sound on anyway. Sorry LG, but for some folks that is just a load of something smelly.3/19/12 update: I discovered the the back of my Dish DVR has some audio out jacks. Now that I can use my headphones again I'm a very happy camper. If anyone else has a hearing issue and need to use headphones, check the back of your cable/satellite box. After using the TV for a few days we are very happy with it. The 2d to 3d works fairly well if you have a good movie or hd boradcast. Not perfect but enough to make it enjoyable. 3d on with a 3d movie or sports broadcast is awesome. The active 3d has absolutely nothing on the LG passive system. Not having to charge the glassesand the light weight are a major plus.I firmly believe the active 3d will go the way of the beta and cassette.

I ended up turning off the auto feature that adjusts for the room lighting.  I found the picture to be too dark at times and a strain to watch it.  I personally am not a fan of 16:9 images, find them annoying compared to 4:3.  People look shorter and fatter than then are.  Seems silly to have such a big screen and only use half of it to view the 4:3 ratio, but do it sometimes depending on what I'm watching.  The color was really colorful and had to back it down some.  I watch NASCAR and as far as any image drag etc I see none.  I'm sure the  240Hz helps with that.  I've seen enough tvs that do that to know that this one doesn't and watching the race in HD on it was very nice.  Also the black color shows up very dark and not too washed out like some tvs.Sound - for a TV I find the sound pretty quality pretty good but know it could be better with a sound bar or something with a sub, so might add one just for a better overall watching experience.Remotes -  The regular remote isn't bad to use when needed and like the background light feature, unfortunately have to use my cable box remote to change channels or access DVR, so it pretty much sits there most of the time unused until I need to access a TV feature.  Maybe someday there will be code to add Comcast cable boxes to other remotes.  The wand remote is helpful to have especially when you need to type so you can just point and click, put its calibration is kind of poor.  It drifts of center point constantly, especially when playing games where it's used more.  It's like the Wii controller only more frustrating.  When you are pointing 3 feet to the left of the tv and the cursor is in the middle of the screen it can be annoying and mess with your head.  Easy fix is to move the wand until the cursor stops at the opposite edge of the tv and you hand and cursor line up again,  but you have to do that way too frequently.  If there is a setting to adjust haven't found it yet.3D -  The 3D feature is ok and nice to be able to convert any show into 3D, but not finding the depth of the picture all that different than 2D with the cheap glasses .  Maybe a movie with better action or written for 3D will be better, but haven't tested that yet.Network Connection -  Easily connected to my home wireless network (as long as you remember where you wrote down your WEP key)!  Not finding accessing folders/files on my network (DNLP) all that easy to do at first and is a little confusing.  Had to download Plex to my computer first and upload folders to what seems like an internet site, not sure I liked that.  I installed the Nero software that came with it to share files to the tv but not finding the feature on the tv to access those folders as stated in the manual.  I also downloaded an android app to my phone called Tonky to try to access files on my phone, seems to be working fine on the phone end but not finding on the TV how to access the files so still working on that.  There might be a better phone app for that too, probably just a learning curve at this point....haven't test the direct USB connection yet to see how well that works to display pics etc. or connected my laptop directly to the tv but point of having the Wi-Fi  feature is to avoid having to do that, so we shall see.Smart TV - probably the most disappointing part of the TV and why I only gave it 4 stars.  LG needs to figure out how to make a product that's going to compete with all the other ones out there with this feature to make them so that the only solution to internet video's not playing due to a software update problem isn't to buy the newer model.  Advertising is a little shaky when they say \"Smart TV allows you to access limitless content, thousands of movies, customizable apps, videos and the best of the web all organized in a simple to use interface\"  I don't use Netflix type features at this point, but the one reason I decided to get this model and pay for a tv that has \"smart tv\" built in was to be able to access anything on the internet including, youtube video's etc.  Well it will play SOME video's on youtube and other sites, but if a video uses  Flash 11 to run you are SOL.  It has 10 but there was a problem getting the TV to work with 11, so Adobe does not have a version that can be used with this TV OS and LG said they wouldn't be fixing the situation and suggested a newer model.  Maybe if they get enough complaints they will change their minds.  I specifically wanted to access GBTV on it without connecting my laptop or purchasing a separate Roku device, but since those videos use Flash 11 along with I'm sure a lot of other sites, if not now in the near future, it makes this feature almost obsolete out of the box.  I didn't wait for the end of the year sales to buy a TV for a good price with this feature so I could turn around and return it and pay $800 more to get a new model just so it can use Flash 11.  Come on LG, you can do better than that!  At this point I'm now looking into a Sony DVD/Google TV unit to supplement since I need a new DVD player anyway.  I think it will be a better overall Smart TV function than LG has especially with it having the QWERTY keyboard etc and better cursor control.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG 47LW6500 spec adjustments and necessity of receiver", "Author": "SeattleSkier \"Mel\"", "ReviewID": "R3NF47445M1N8V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Beautiful TV.

This means that if you want surround sound, you must cable your DVD player directly to your surround sound receiver and not through the TV.

The motion remote is simple to use but has a strange movement where it stops on the edge of the screen and then gets off center when you bring it back to center. It is great for my grandfather having the standard remote control. I also got the matched LG 3D blueray player and speakerbar with sub. They work great but I wish LG had one remote to control all the components on one and have the speakerbar completely take over as the source of volume. I have to set that up on my own as my grandfather would be confused between alternating speakerbar and tv volume. The SMART Tv screen is a bit cluttered as if LG is just packing it to say they have all these features. The weather app only features major cities. It is great having Netflix available on the TV so the kids don't have to use the Wii. I just wish more of my periferals used HDMI.

It's got an exceptional form-factor that is ultra thin and looks great in any room.I'd start my review out by saying I'm just as much of a gamer as many others out there who bought this TV to play games. Some people have complained a little about input lag in gaming, but if you switch the TV to \"Game\" mode, the input lag is significantly reduced and I have had no problems playing just about anything on it. I think those complaining either A) didn't switch to \"Game\" mode which reduces input lag or B) are nitpicking way too much.So don't let input lag sway you from purchasing this TV. Unless you're nitpicking to an extreme degree, you won't have a problem.Everything looks phenomenal on this TV, and black levels are pretty deep with the right source. Blu-ray movies in particular have incredible black levels on this TV thanks to LED Local Dimming, which is really a \"high end\" feature only found on top model LEDs.My only complaint with this TV is the 2D to 3D conversion feature. It really doesn't work that well and the images wind up very unnaturally represented in 3D, with football games having grass that appears to cave in and floating players and lines. And it hurts your eyes. So I never use it, it's just about useless.Actual 3D content works great. I've been very satisfied with the 3D content I've watched on this TV, with movies like RIO and The Lion King looking exceptional and being a very pleasant experience overall. But with so much limited content available for 3D currently, it's hard to say I use 3D all that much. It has a side-by-side 3D conversion feature that works perfectly, which is great for content that may have been designed for other 3d platforms to work well on this set.There's also that argument about LG's 3D being half the resolution of active 3D sets like Samsung or Sony. But you know what? I can't tell the difference at all. Your brain takes the two halves and combines them, so with both eyes open, you can't tell at all that the resolution is halved. It still looks fantastic. Plus nobody is going to be sitting 2 inches from their TV screen so you really wouldn't notice anyway. Trust me on this one. This 3D is winning 3D with no flickering.Overall I'm extremely happy with this TV, and I'd recommend it to anyone.

The Cinema 3D experience is really great. I've had two high-end samsung 3D plasmas, pn63c8000 and d8000 (the first was stolen, the other returned after a brief trial period), and I'll never go back to active 3D.You may have heard all the arguments for one approach vs. the other and you have to make your own decision for sure, but to me the choice is obvious. A simpler solution with fewer parts to break (transmitters, shutter glasses, etc). Passive 3D is much more relaxing to watch as well. No flicker. No headaches. No eye fatigue or other physiological drawbacks that active sets / shutter glasses can produce. There is occasional ghosting, but its very rare and much, much less prominent than I have experienced with the active sets I've had. Ghosting is more prominent if you stray too far from the vertical / horizontal center of the TV though. The glasses are soooo light and inexpensive. There's no recharging... or sync issues between the glasses and TV which I've experienced with the active sets. The 3D effect itself is really impressive... as good or better than the active sets I've seen (despite the lower res).Yes, the vertical resolution is half that of an active set, since the two offset images are interleaved, i.e. 540 for the left eye, 540 for the right eye. On the other hand, the horizontal resolution is still the same, i.e. 1920, so its not like you're looking at half the resolution. If your sitting at least 8-10 feet away, the 3D picture can look near full HD.So what about the TV in general? Overall its pretty good. Color out of the box will need some adjusting. I found the tint a bit greenish when I was watching some cable programs. With a quick amount of adjusting I was able to improve it. Haven't done a full calibration yet. I haven't tried the apps or smart TV features yet, but others have probably provided enough information on that. I've heard some great things about this though. I haven't tried the magic remote either.I really like the zoom options on this TV. There's a special Cinema zoom that lets you customize the zoom level (not in 3D though), so you zoom away the black bars. I really DON'T like the stupid 3d Warning message that displays EVERY time the TV begins to display 3D material. Its so annoying I'm still considering returning it. There's no option to disable it, ever. You have to pick up the remote and confirm you have acknowledged the fact that your eyes might melt in their sockets and your brain may turn to play dough. I talked with an LG support person and expressed my dissatisfaction with this feature. He stated he would forward the complaint to the right persons. I've seen several complaints on A/v forums about this. Samsung does it as well. There should be an option to disable it after seeing it so many times. I also DON'T like having to go into the HOME menu and navigating to Setup in order to change important TV settings. That's 5 clicks of the remote. Really? There should be a shortcut. Because of the TV menu, calibrating may be a little difficult since it can block calibration images in the background (if you are trying to calibrate the TV with special video images).In short, here are a few of this TVs pros and cons (that I've experienced so far):Pros:- Great 3D, with none of the active problems.- Special zoom optionCons:- backlight bleed- not full HD 3D, yet...

I guess I'm spoiled. The Samsung is probably the best LED TV ever made... a plasma quality picture. It just doesn't do 3D. I've decided to return the LG TV.

Two guys came in and set the tv inside and asked me if they wanted me to have them wait there till i got it up and running. I told them i could handle it and they could go.So now the unboxing. I layed it on the ground and started opening it. It was packaged very nicely inside with a lot of styroform protection. So i got it out of the box and layed it face down so i could attach my wall mounts. They went on fairly easy and so now it was time to lift it on the wall by myself :(. I didn't think this was that heavy i think it said some where its 55 Lbs. So i got it on the wall with no problems and now time to hook everything up.I plugged in my tv connection and my xbox then the usb dongle thing that connects to your WiFI. I then go to take off the protection around the side and i noticed the bottom left corner was dented in. Long story short the box was damaged down in that corner and i called up amazon and they refunded me about 10% for the damage.I turn it on and let it do the channel search, when its done i start watching tv and i noticed there was a twitching in the screen. Wasn't sure if it was the cable or the tv but eventually after playing around for a while it went away. The color on the default setting is ok... might want to adjust that to your liking.There is no light leakage around the sides. The wifi connection is good, its a very thin tv. I have used the 3D conversion it comes with but i lacks the depth of the ones in the stores i see. I might eventually upgrade to a 3D blu ray player but not untill they come down in price a little.Overall i'm very happy with the tv, it playes video from my xbox in 1080p no problem, and also can connect to my laptop via HMDI and make it just like having a 47\" moniter.I only once had the speakers on and they sounded pretty well for a tv, i usually have it hooked up to a 5.1 receiver.

I owned a computer 3D system years ago for playing video games and was looking forward to having the setup again. The passive system is a pleasant surprise, I will never use shutter glasses again. I find that there is a lots less eye strain. Image quality seems somewhat less as compared to full HD 2D, but the 3d more than make up for it. If you have DirecTV there are 4 channels already in 3D, 103 to 107, 3 free, one pay for view. The 2D-3D conversion is passable and works well where it works. Some the cons I find are the some the menus and how to get to all of them. Being a 'smart' TV the menus are sure dumb. The buttons on the remote seem too close, I am always hitting the wrong button with the directional keys. Also, I dislike having to use the remote to click enter every time I switch to 3D content, it should just flash the message and go away. Waiting for a DVI to HDMI cable to try out my computer. The TV only has a digital audio out so had to get a optical to RCA box for my sound setup. I have never been a big sports fan, but watching sports in 3D adds new life. I especially like the slow-mo replays, kind of like watching the Matrix.Setup is easy. I recommend two people. I was able to get it myself, but I was worried about dumping the TV over when putting the in screws. There is a cable tie the holds the power cord out of the way, so that is very helpful. The base has a large foot print and swivels back and forth, but seem to be a tad wobbly so make sure you have a sturdy stand. I have never own a LG product before and would recommend this TV.update: The software was updated and no longer ask you if you want to switch to 3d mode. My PS3 will go from 2D to 3D with out any input or messages, when putting in 3D movies. LOVE this TV. Bumped it up to 5 stars since the software updates. Still not happy with the menu scheme, but I don't have to go into it very much. Most all video games I have played worked well with the 2D to 3D conversion. Most of the issues I've seen are like flat pictures(images sitting on desks or walls), the image should be flat but it too, is converted.

This set, with all its bells and whistles, seemed to fit the bill. I wanted to purchase from a local retailer, but had difficulty finding one who had it in stock.  I had concerns about buying on line and having it delivered to my house by anonymous delivery men who would say \"sign here\".  I would have no \"store\" to complain to if there were problems.I wound up buying from Amazon because of their reputation for service and liberal return policy.  They also have a 14-day price guarantee on TV's, bending the ever-present timing gamble more in my direction.  [14 days went by without a better price advertised on line].  The delivery came exactly on time; no, they did not dump it on my front steps, the delivery was scheduled well in advance so I would be sure to be home.  I didn't expect the delivery guys to set it up for me, but they offered to carefully open the box so I could examine the set for damage.The on-line manual, also available on an included disk, is more complete then the hard copy that comes with the set, and has the advantage of being searchable. I found it useful to \"preview\" the set using the on-line version prior to delivery, so I could get right at it. When it arrived, I already knew how to attach the stand (insert 8 screws, that's it) and do the preliminary setup, which was intuitive and quick.I was not able to preview a set in a store, so, as I am rather finicky, I was nervous about whether I would find the picture to my liking when I turned it on.  Though the matte finish doesn't eliminate reflection completely (none do), it does make a dramatic difference in both daytime and nighttime viewing, compared with the glass-screen plasma set it replaced. This is particularly true considering the ease with which the picture can be adjusted to suit the lighting environment (see below).I had expected to be somewhat disappointed when comparing it to the excellent picture on my plasma set.  I was not. I was pleasantly surprised by the sharpness, clarity, and color rendition right out of the box. Even after manually fiddling some with the incredible array of adjustment controls for some time, including the auto-adjust (\"picture wizard\"), I kept returning to factory settings which, after many trials, appeared to me to provide the optimum picture.  Tech guys: 1, me: 0.In the old days, when you bought a TV, you simply turned it on and what you see is what you get. Not so these days. There are so many features on this set it would take a book to test and review everything, so I will choose just a few things I think are worth mentioning.Hooking up to wireless internet was fairly easy, once I ignored the suggestion in the hard copy manual to use the WPS button on my router to enter the security code. Hint: enter the code manually, letter by letter, number by number.  Once you do that you are connected.  I have watched several movies via Netflix in high definition with absolutely no problems.  For those with hearing loss, you now have the option to have closed captioning on most Netflix films.  I haven't yet tried the LG aps function.The \"intelligent sensor\" setting will automatically adjust the brightness of the screen to correspond to surroundings, and it does it well.  Beyond that, if you are a control freak and like to be in command, the \"energy saving\" button on the remote does much more than control power consumption.  You can toggle this button through a series of levels, i.e., minimum, medium, and maximum, and you can even turn the screen completely off while listening to shows that don't require video, such as music channels. Of course all sets, including this one, have the ability to control brightness and contrast through the settings menu, but it is far easier to make these adjustments by simply pushing a button on the remote and toggle through the options without losing the video or audio, rather than having to wade through a menu with multiple steps.Speaking of the remote: the set comes with two.  I'm still learning to use the first.  I have resisted programming it to my Harmony universal remote until I become familiar with the options on the new remote.  The second remote is a simpler RF version, with just six buttons plus a direction wheel:  Power, Home, Enter, Volume, Channel, Mute.  It operates like a wireless mouse with a cursor on the screen. This enables the viewer to pick options or use on-screen keyboards more easily (to enter URL's, for example).  I'm not certain what the point is (no pun intended), but my guess is that once you have the set pretty much set up to your liking, you need only the most basic controls, and the pointer makes basic functions easier. I don't know if that is true.  There is no number pad for channel selection, for example, just a channel level.  I suppose for games a pointer is necessary, but most game sets come with their own pointers.  And I haven't explored the LG aps, a big part of this \"smart\" TV, which might well make use of the pointer.  All I use the internet for is streaming movies, so I'm not the best one to judge.  If anyone has a better idea of why the second remote, I'd like to know.A word about 3-D: Wow!  I didn't buy the set for 3D, and still consider it somewhat of a gimmick that may soon die off like it did in theaters in the `50's.  But the effect is real and dramatic, much better than I thought.  It is literally a new dimension of TV watching. The availability of 3D video to watch is severely limited at this point -- travelogues, a handful of horror and kids' movies, one or two \"adult\" features (no, not that kind), and some sports.  But the three or four 3D channels I receive via Direct TV satellite provide enough whizbang to impress even the most skeptical.  The light, inexpensive glasses (4 are provided) are easy to wear and remove. Plus I think my wife looks great with the thick orange frames. I won't comment on how I must look. I wear prescription glasses, so I purchased a pair of clip-ons.I bought a 3-year extended warranty from LG for about $165.All told, I am thoroughly satisfied with the set and give it my highest 5-star rating.

However I can't stop thinking that I paid more than I should have.3D is passive which is good because it does not give you a headache. On the other hand it reduces the screen resolution. LG claims that human brain processing the images compensate for the loss of resolution and viewer is able to see images as clear as in active 3D. I can certainly say that it not true and resolution loss is noticeable. 2D is more clear than 3D.Local dimming sometimes give a weird effects such as witter stripes on black background across the screen. But it generally improves black and reduces the power consumption. I believe this TV has lowest power consumption in the class.My real disappointment is the apps and DLNA. I was thinking that I pay extra for convenience do not use a computer but stream movies from home server. I have tried all alternatives and now I only use this TV connecting to the computer as a regular monitor. TV can't connect to network shares. Instead you need to ran DLNA server on your computer so TV would connect to it. Ones I have the server running I found that it can't play iso files with DVDs (I believe it is anti piracy measures that restrict the applications of network attached entertainment). You have to rip DVD to avi to play it . And you will not have DVD menu with options to choose. Reaping all of the iso I have is time consuming and certainly not an option. So I had to use HDMI connection parallel with some of the apps. However it did not took long time to realize that EVERYTHING works better in the computer. You have one mouse to do everything including reading email, running matlab calculation and watching TV. I do not use anything other than HDMI connection anymore.

The 2d to 3d conversion is crazy, and so far in watching ESPN, NBA TV, HBO, UFC, HDNet Fights (all in HD), it just adds another level of depth and clarity to the experience that makes it pop out more.  Now don't get me wrong, the 2d to 3d conversion is not theater or 3d-dvd style 3d that pops out of the screen flying at you, but it does add depth and detail to people and surfaces you would never have noticed before.

Just another reason to buy this TV as it changes the gaming experience across the board.Now for the shipping, I bought this item through amazon from the seller MODIA, and they use HomeDirect USA for shipping.  Let me make this clear, HomeDirect USA is not UPS or even FedEx, so do not have any expectations on being able to track your item or on getting it in a short period of time.  The seller was responsive to my emails but clueless as to if the item was picked up from the shipper or not, even though they sent me an email the following day after I purchased the TV saying it had shipped.  Very frustrating.  This complaint on the shipping experience is not a reflection of amazon at all since the item was shipped by the seller instead.  Addiitonally, I'm a former employee of the company having worked for them a few years in the late 90's, so I know the dedication amazon puts in to making sure the customer experience is perfect from beginning to end.  Had this item been sold and shipped by amazon I'm convinced I would not have had this type of experience with the shipping.In terms of the TV, you cannot go wrong with it, a great addition for anyone, especially the family.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "good tv for the price", "Author": "oshusttoley", "ReviewID": "R3LD5JZGB2PTE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV about 3 weeks ago (47LW6500).

I order quite heavily from Amazon and have never had a problem like the one I experienced after ordering this TV on Dec 4. The TV arrived and the box looked fine, but when I got it out of the box I could not find the screws with which to assemble it. It came with a guide and the phone number to call LG to get help. I called and asked if it was possible to get some instruction on where to find the screws in the packaging, they could not tell me where to look. I hung up and I took everything apart piece by piece, but they were definitely not there. I called LG back and they finally said that sometimes their TVs are shipped without all of the parts but if I bought a wall mount that it would come with the necessary screws. I don't have a wall that I can hang it on, so a wall mount wouldn't help me. After calling and calling them until the 16th they finally offered to send the missing screws but warned me that I would take 8-10 days for them to arrive. I said OK because Christmas was 9 days away and I stood a better than likely chance of getting the screws from them by Christmas and I really didn't feel I had any other options. Its not that I am too cheap to go out and buy the screws at a hardware store, but the problem is that they are speciality screws that are not sold in hardware stores. They are exactly to the strange length and width that works with that stand and no other ones will do the job. Without the necessary parts to hold it up how are you supposed to even watch it? I've never even turned this beast on because my arms aren't long enougth to hold it and get far enought away to see it. Its ridiculous!LG Infinia 55LW5600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D GlassesI also called Paul's TV (the vendor who sold the TV via Amazon) and explained the problem to them. The gentleman that answered the phone tried calling their local service center in my area and they advised him to call LG and get LG to send them. He called LG and was told that they were on their way and would definitley arrive by Dec 27. I thanked him for spending the extra time, but that was a worse date than LG had promised me. I inquired about returning the TV to Paul's and he said that at this point it wasn't necessary.Here's the part I love about this whole thing. I didn't want to throw out the packaging which for a 47\" TV set is quite large because I just had a feeling this wouldn't work out. The only place I had to store it was in the middle of my living room which was noticed by every member of my extended family all day long for Christmas. I have a very large (opinionated) family. What did you get for Christams? Thanks Amazon/Paul's TV/LG!Today is Dec 30. I just got off the phone with LG who informed me that the screws finally shipped out yesterday. I don't believe them because as I've been calling them since they first promised they were in the mail and have heard every prediction possible on when they would arrive and they are still not here. I decided to return the TV to Paul's and knew from other conversations that I had with them that I cannot take it to a local Paul's TV store because their online business has no connection with their brick and morter locations. I called Paul's and was told that there would be a $100 shipping charge and a 50% re-stocking fee just to return THEIR broken/missing-parted merchandise. I've paid Amazon close to $1200 for the initial cost of the TV, now I also need to pay to send it back and I have to photograph it before I send it per Paul's TV request and I have to pack it up and I have to get it to a shipping center?? I am incredibly angry and feel totally hustled by Amazon (who would not get involved when I called them about the problem), Paul's TV (who shipped something that was defective and told me it was my problem to call LG) and LG who I am sure though I wouldn't know sells good TVs but doesn't stand behind them when the arrive without their parts.Run away now, at least if you are not also purchasing a wall mount.

After reading the reviews which really didn't mention this set's compatibility with Directv I went ahead and ordered it based particularly on the passive glasses, Amazon's reurn reputation and some great reviews for LG products.The television sat in my lower level for 4 weeks while I had the existing bookcases, where my two tvs were built in located in my den, removed..  I then had to get rid of my 12 year old Sony Trinitron 36 inch tube tv (which weighs about 300 lbs).  Unfortunatly it was a SD televison . That parting was sad for me as that era Trinitron had the best SD picture I had ever experiencd.Now we have new bookcases built in and my 55 inch Sanyo HD plasma is on the upper level and the LG 3d is at seated eye level.The installation was as simple as plugging in the HDMI from the Directv DVR and turning it on.  I am pleased to report all the directv 3D channels were immediatly viewable incl ESPN and I have been glued to the channels viewing both re-run sports as well as great Sony 3D tours of the Mayan empire as well as Rome.

We had yet to have an HDTV in our home. So I relied heavily on other reviews to decide on which to buy. Actually I originally bought an LG 55LW5600 (the 120Hz version of this one) from another seller only to have all of its HDMI ports completely fail on me. So I returned that unit to them and searched some more. Because I was looking for all the features that this LG had to offer (Lightweight, LED, passive 3D, excellent colors and blacks, multiple port options, etc) and none of the other manufacturers even came close, I chose to give LG another try and bought the 240Hz 55LW6500.I was relieved to find that all of the HDMI ports worked however it was most disappointing and unfortunate that this unit arrived with a different issue. When I tried to view certain 3D movies with my Verizon FIOS set top box, the picture failed to display the 3D properly no matter what I try to do. The picture is either heavily double overlayed or digitally smeared. LG technical support was unable to help me as this could be a Verizon issue. Verizon tech support was clueless and had no answer. The problem is only with certain movies. It seems the Disney 3D movies (Cars 2, Pirates of the Caribbean etc) all show okay but none of the others do.

Purchase and delivery were smooth, price was competitive.  Excellent TV, also best value.  Researched a lot.  Reviews by CNET, CNET Australia, CNET Asia, and others differ, because personal preference about picture quality differs, and because room settings differ.TV handles bright light from many windows with no glare.  Not quite as fluid as plasma, but definitely close enough.  Picture quality is personal taste.  That's why reviews differ on CNET, CNET Australia, CNET Asia, and other sites.  CNET likes deep blacks and bold colors -- before I bought my TV, I agreed.  I no longer agree.  My 47LW6500 convinced me that a realistic cinematic picture (CNET Australia's preference) suits me better than an artificially bold picture (CNET's preference).  It's hard to explain what a realistic cinematic picture means, seeing is believing.  Blacks definitely are deep enough.  Colors definitely are bold enough.  No leaking light from any side of the screen.  LED edge-lighting works perfectly.  Have not owned the TV long enough to comment on motion blur, extreme picture lighting situations, etc. -- time will tell.  Watched only 1 3D movie (using a 3D blu-ray player) -- good picture, good 3D, comfortable glasses.Excellent features.  Web browser works fine.  \"Premium\" Apps work fine, and include some I like -- Amazon, Skype, Youtube, Netflix, etc.  Free Apps not very appealing, but work fine.  Magic Remote is wonderful, with one exception -- when you point it at the TV, the on-screen pointer doesn't line up well, so you have to aim \"off angle\".  Selection of picture modes (cinema, normal, bright) is limited, but adequate.  Firmware upgrades are easy.  I haven't tried the Wi-Fi dongle.My Verizon FIOS input goes to my a/v receiver by HDMI.  My a/v receiver goes to my TV by HDMI.  My blu-ray player goes to my a/v receiver by HDMI.  All are 3D and DLNA devices.  Sound is through external speakers, excellent.The external frame of the TV is classic, unobtrusive.  Unlike high-styled Samsung's, it sits in the background unnoticed, and let's me focus on the picture.  I don't want to \"knock\" Samsung's because they are good, but I don't like Samsung's marketing decisions -- high style frame, bold artificial blacks and colors.  I prefer LG's marketing decisions -- focus 1st on a realistic cinematic picture, and on easy-to-use powerful Internet access and Apps.Next purchase?  A webcam for the Skype App.2/13/2012 UPDATE TO MY REVIEW:I had a pixelation problem.  I called LG tech support.  Tech support answered the phone promptly, was polite, and \"worked with me\" to try to figure out the problem.  LG tech support concluded that the problem was with my Verizon FIOS provider.  However, instead of just \"passing the buck\", LG tech support told me to call back if Verizon FIOS said the problem is with the TV.  I did not have to call back to LG, because Verizon FIOS admitted it was their problem and they fixed it by replacing some hardware.UPDATE TO MY REVIEW:I don't know if it's a good idea to buy anything from Amazon, or even to open an account with Amazon.

It worked well for two years with minor bumps that I was able to fix through research on the net. First time I needed support was today.A few days ago the TV stopped responding to the remote, both the regular LG remote as well as the Magic Motion remote. It would only turn on or off but none of the other buttons will work including Home, Input, Volume or Channel. I though it was a problem with the remote or the sensor on the TV so I tried the controls on the front of the TV with same results. None of them worked. I can currently only switch the TV on or off using the control on the TV or either remote - so the senor is working.I did some research again and it seems this might be due to a recent firmware update and a hard reset would fix it. Unfortunately, since none of the controls are working I cannot get into any menu including the settings menu to reset it. I contacted LG support and had a chat session with a support person. He was completely useless and couldn't help me and asked me to call a number and be put to Tier 2 support. I called the number and spoke with a lady who refused to put me to Tier 2 support and said since my TV is 2 years old old I'll have to schedule a service technician to come in and the charges will be anywhere between $150 to $225 for minor repairs and more for major.I'm pretty sure at this point that this is a software / firmware issue since the TV still works. I can watch it when I turn it on but can't change anything on it, including channels, input or volume but it works where it is set.

I do get that feeling whenever watching Blu-Rays through my PS3. The biggest issue is with gaming have a LAG, however I have found the CURE FOR THIS. ATTENTION: Set your configuration for the HDMI input your gaming console is connected too as PC/COMPUTER under the re-label portion of the menu. This will fix all Lag issues during gaming however it will remove the feature of 240HZ and a few other picture options. It makes First Person Shooters just as operational as before you bought this TV. Getting an Onkyo receiver will also fix these issues and allow you to keep the picture settings.

The blacks are BLACK. The TruMotion does a decent job computing intermediate frames. Sound is decent for built-in TV speakers. Picture even out of the box seems pretty good to me. The clouding others have mentioned is nowhere near as bad for me as it is for them in their pictures. My blank black screen is pretty darn consistent. I have SLIGHT, almost undetectable dim areas top and bottom center.3D effect is great. Even the 2D-3D conversion is impressively enjoyable! Well done to the programmers who developed it.Most importantly though, I got this for gaming. Ouch! Xbox 360 input lag is borderline unbearable. I have 4.02.62 firmware, tried all the tricks (Game Mode, Game/PC label, etc). The firmware and settings helped a lot, but it's still terrible. If you're a true gamer, don't let others who have said \"LG fixed it/Game Mode eliminates input lag\" fool you, they don't know what they're talking about. Gamers can detect input lag, and let me tell you it is bad, in ALL kinds of games, FPS, racing, Fable III, etc. With a computer outputting HDMI, it's between 114-170ms (millisecond timer cloned on both screens, took pics with cell phone to see time discrepancy). With the Xbox 360 via HDMI, it looks and feels about within that same range, definitely no less. I was a competitive Counter-Strike player on PC years ago, and the input lag with the Xbox 360 on this TV is pretty much exactly like if you had a ping of about 140ms online in CS or any other shooter, and those who play online shooters know what a ping of 140ms feels like (ouch!!). A pro would never survive in a multiplayer FPS match with this TV.The highest rated review states being able to get input lag down to around 30ms. I have no idea how they're measuring, but that sounds impossible to me with this TV. \"Effectively zero input lag\" displays have lag around 30ms. This TV from LG is NOWHERE near that. Like I said, I've objectively measured it as low as 114ms, but no lower. Even without objective measurements, it feels exactly within that range as well. The other reviewer's sentiments still hold, I would just discount their actual numbers. There's no way they are that low. If they were, we wouldn't even be able to tell (only a rare few can honestly say they detect a difference between 10ms and 30ms of lag online on a PC... no one can tell on a console game on a TV.. so 30ms is effectively zero lag. This TV does not have zero lag.)I decided I like the TV enough to keep it, partly in hopes that if enough of us complain to LG, they'll release yet another firmware update that no-kidding bypasses ALL of the image processing... but I'm not getting my hopes too high.I've played Xbox on this TV enough to where it's become tolerable, but only barely. I still enjoy my games as long as I don't touch my older Samsung plasma for a while, which has effectively zero input lag. I guess that's the sacrifice we make for all this new \"Smart TV\" technology for now, until it matures and they seriously beef up the processing power of these TVs to handle all the extra image processing they've added to them. Unfortunately, the vast majority of LG consumers and even casual gamers won't notice the input lag.. and that's good enough for LG. They aren't too concerned with satisfying the remaining 1% of us serious gamers, which is totally reasonable but unfortunate for us. So for now, we either have to buy an older \"dumb\" TV, or spend significantly more than this TV costs, to get one that's powerful enough to keep the input lag down. Great TV, but as others have said, if you're getting this for gaming, you've been warned! If you're used to near-zero input lag like me, you'll be very frustrated.Please LG, release another update that has an option to COMPLETELY bypass ALL image post-processing for gaming!! You may think we can't detect 140ms lag, but even 100ms is on the edge of being tolerable for any serious gamer!", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV - Terrible Stand", "Author": "Michael J.

I don't see the need to buy external speakers unless I really want it.To hook up other media LG provides a software called medialink that you have to download and install on your PC in case you want to watch or listen to something that is on your computer. I tried this and found to be a bit cumbersome but LG has another options. They ship the TV with a licensed version of NERO which is way better than medialink in terms of performance and very intuitive. So just install NERO on your PC and register your TV and you can browse to the designated folder on your computer from your TV and play video or audio file or watch pictures. No need to manually hookup your computer to the TV. Its all wireless and clutter free:). The TV by the way supports a lot of video and audio formats. I can pretty much play all my downloaded content on the TV.I have not played around much with 3D content but there are few sample programs like \"cities of the world\" etc which are 15-20 min documentaries that can be watched and it looks great. The glasses are plastic made and very light to wear and unlike active shutter glasses there are no batteries to change. 4 pairs are included in the TV and its inexpensive to buy more if you need (about $15-20 for another 4 pair I think). I personally don't prefer active glasses and that is one of the reasons I went for the LG brand. Both Sony and Samsung has active 3D. LG and Visio make passive 3D.The only -ve point I have is that in energy saving mode, the TV dims, it gets really dark to the point where you can hardly watch anything. It looks like they have over done this particular feature to the point that its almost not usable. So the TV has to always remain in any of the other modes, standard, game, cinema etc... so what is the point in offering energy saving mode when you can't watch anything? For this I take out one star.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the picture quality!", "Author": "Snowflake's Mom", "ReviewID": "RJEO1RSG9112W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from a store about a month ago. It's my first flat screen. I read reviews on Consumer Reports and chose it because it got great ratings for picture quality. I had originally planned to buy the next step down from this - the 5500 which is not 3D. But the 2D picture on the 6500 was significantly better when we looked at them side by side.So far, I'm very pleased with the TV. The picture quality on HD is amazing. I can view it from any angle, even sitting beside it. It gets pretty decent sound quality when watching cable TV (FIOS) but when we watch a Netflix movie streaming through the included wireless adapter, we have to turn the volume up to max. I have not tried using it with the DVD player yet.I'm not impressed with the application that gets us on the web. The browser is really limited. You can watch YouTube, but it's really hard to search or scroll through videos there. It's also hard to navigate Netflix. You have to use a wand and point to letters on the screen to spell out search terms, which is a pain.So overall, it's great regardless of whether you actually want a 3D television (personally, I hate 3D).

Another big problem was that something went wrong with the circuit board after about 3 months of use.  One day the TV suddenly cut off and would not turn back on no matter what I did.  The customer service from LG was great since I was still under warranty.  They dispatched a service engineer who was able to come to my house, and replace the main circuit board fairly quickly and at no cost.

With 3D technology being very new, I was hesitant to say the least then add passive or active shutter...Overload!!! I narrowed it down to this model because it's; 240hz, price, 9mil:1 contrast, 2D to 3D, $11 vs. $100+ for glasses, etc! I purchased it through Amazon due to the fact that it was a \"special order item\" just about everywhere local. Price was better too.  Once I pulled the trigger, it took until the last day of the shipping window to get here. It did come with some slight hidden damage, look for my review of the seller!! Ripped it out, mounted to the wall, and turned it on- excellent picture, right out of the box! I must note that this is only my 2nd flat screen, I have a PS3, as well as Directv HD DVR. With no calibration but about ten minutes messing with the settings it looked even better! It's like watching movies the way they were meant to be seen. Sports are perfect! I'm not sure there is any better way to watch, other than being in the stands.  The 3D is a nice option, but I don't think I'll be watching a whole bunch in 3D. Blue Ray looks stunning in 3d though, well the Planet Earth series anyhow. I checked out some Ultimate Fighter, hockey, and even some golf they all looked great!!! There are some very strange effects on some things, Titanic happened to be on HBO. Most things looked amazing, but there was a couple shots of the ship that had like big blotches of color (just the ship)... Can't explain it any other way. With 3D off and rewind on the DVR, the picture was perfect.  Sadly I do not have Wi-Fi YET... So I cannot judge the internet. The sound isn't the best but I've got a Sony home theater system to set up shortly. Only other complaint is the Directv remote can't be programmend to work with it...poor me!  Overall, I say buy it!!! Personally I believe for this model tv, for the price I paid, is comparable to the high end brands, just not double the price!!

It's not perfect, but it comes pretty close. The web apps are a bit of a pain, I don't really care for them, but they do work. I have a Netflix account which is really the only app I would use, but I run it through my LG LHB536 1100W 3D Blu-ray Home Theater System, which also has the App.3D Movies are expensive, but are worth the money! Our first movie was Tron: Legacy 3D and sitting there watching the movie on that screen and with the surround sound higher then my wife's comfort level, it was incredible!! When the paranoid flew over head, my son and I looked at each other and just smiled and then started giggling like little school girls.This was not my first HD TV, I have a 48\" Toshiba LCD, 32\" Vizio LED, and 26\" Proscan LCD.

As for the passive 3D glasses, they are very comfortable, and don't worry about buying new ones as extras if you go to Real D 3D Movies, those glasses work fine with this TV.I only gave 4 stars because of the mounting hardware that was included was unusable and the remote is very basic. In this day and age, nearly everyone has a cable box of some sort, it would be nice to have the ability to turn on, and change your cable channels with out using two remotes because you can't turn on your 3D with your cable remote and you can't turn on your cable with your 3D remote.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "good mid-size HDTV", "Author": "M.

I would rate the picture with a good source as a 9 or 9.5 out of 10.one thing that was a real surprise was the 2D to 3D conversion that can be applied to all inputs, including photos off your USB drive.  it's incredible!  ESPN, DVD's, non 3D BlueRays, everything can be converted and the result is probably 80% of what you get at the theater!  really impressive and the glasses are passive so you can wear them over eyeglasses (like me) without digging a hole in the side of your nose.LG Apps are OK I guess, compared to other ipTV's but I was unimpressed to the point where I threw together a low cost HTPC and use that for all my internet streaming/browsing.  the TV is just too slow in processing web pages on its own.  drove me crazy.  a nice touch is the second remote they give you with cursor control - makes selecting options much easier and having 2 remotes makes the wife happy.sound is OK, this TV is in my front room.

Everything works great and the passive 3d effect is Jaw dropping.  However when I mounted my TV on the wall and removed the protective film around the edges I discovered a damaged corner. I had already signed the form stating that the TV was delivered in good shape so I apparently have no recourse except to have a blemished television. I contacted the seller and they graciously offered a 10 percent rebate which I turned down because the damage was not their fault. The problem is the packaging is woefully inadequate.  There is a scant 1/2 inch of Styrofoam between the very pointed edge of the TV corner and whatever the package may happen to bump into. A slight collision and you get a tiny, inconspicuous, finger nail sized hole in the bottom of the cardboard and a chipped corner with a whitish blemish up into the plastic that is disguised until you remove the protective film.  I would be surprised if LG does not have hundreds of similar situations, given the terrible packaging.  I got no satisfaction from Amazon's 100% satisfaction guarantee except congratulations for the offer of the 10 percent rebate.  The point is make sure you remove this film and thoroughly inspect for this kind of damage before you sign for anything.  With that said the blemish is purely cosmetic and this is a great TV.  The regular picture is so stunning, and the features so outstanding that it would be a great deal even without the 3D.

I have used it for about two months now. It has beautiful, crisp picture quality in HD. The HD channels on FIOS Cable look amazing (non-HD channels are obviously not as good). DVDs and Blu-ray discs have amazing quality as well. Stunningly impressive 3D features, especially if it's your first 3D home TV experience. The sound is great as far as I am concerned, but I am just the casual viewer who has never owned home audio equipment. The 47 inch screen size is perfect for my living room. Much easier to navigate the smart TV features with the magic remote than the regular TV remote. I connect using Wi-Fi so I don't have to run the cable to the living room but you can choose to connect to ethernet for a more secure internet connection.Cons: I was super excited to use the Smart TV features when I made the purchase but most of these features have been a disappointment except for Netflix. Streaming from Netflix is very fast and awesome picture (although the first two seconds might appear fuzzy, it clears back up quickly). Even with the magic remote, it is still somewhat cumbersome to browse through the movie choices so it is much easier for me to add Netflix movies/shows onto my instant queue from the computer prior to me watching it on the TV. The web browser on this TV stinks. I have tried multiple websites and takes forever to load and/or won't load correctly. Not sure why most websites don't work on this web browser (I tried loading Pandora.com and it wouldn't work and I'm disappointed it doesn't come with a Pandora app to begin with). The YouTube app that this LG TV comes with is probably the worst app on here- as soon as you open this app, it loads the most random, annoying, inappropriate videos and loops itself over and over and there is no option to turn it off or pause it. The only way to shut it off is to either find the video you are looking for successfully or exit the app altogether. Browsing is not really an option on this YouTube app, you really need to search by the title of the video you want to view. The Smart TV features and apps can use major enhancements.Summary: I forgive the disappointing Smart TV features since it is still technically a TV and not a computer and it is a FANTASTIC TV!!!

The 47\" went to the bedroom. With a house full of LG TVs I can attest to the quality in LG sets, and this one ranks up there with the rest. Purchased ours in November from Wally World and got the same package, with the 3D player and glasses for just under $900. The sales are hard to find right now but this price is very comparable to others who might have it.We have ours connected to our PS3, (remember to update the PS3 to play 3D, it's just an update), and have no issues at all. We use a sound bar so that's one small draw back. There's no output RCA plugs to use with the sound bar. But, we just upgraded to digital TV through the cable company and the cable box has the correct output RCA plugs on the box. The PS3 is connected using the optical audio output. This 47\" 3D is much thinner than the previous 47\" we had. Like 50% thinner, so it weighs even less than the older one. We have ours mounted on a stand that is slated to handle up to 48\" flat screen TVs. But that was the old standard and I'm sure this stand could support even the 55\" one. It has a different remote but all LG remotes will work the basic functions on all sets which is good when you're walking around clicking off sets at supper time. We also noticed that there's less heat coming from the screen on this set than our others so it appears they are continuing to improve these sets. The 3D DVD player plays all DVDs so it's set up in our bedroom as a spare.Our son got us Avatar in 3D for Christmas and it was really amazing. We've watched 3D movies over the net using the PS3 and again, true 3D and amazing. We had checked out this set and one from Sony that was a shutter 3D and they had them set up, side by side at Best Buy. After an hour, we realized that this passive 3D was the better of the units. Purchased 3D clip on glasses from here on Amazon so I use them while the Mrs uses the glasses that came with it. The package comes with 4 pairs of glasses. We also bought the Family Pack of LG Glasses here on Amazon and our 3 year old grand-daughter sat through most of Avatar wearing the kids glasses. Now the neat part of this TV. There's a button that you can push to make 2D broadcasts and movies into 3D. So, while they're not true 3D as such, it's pretty close. It does add a lot of depth to whatever you're watching. My wife was showing our younger son how it works and after an hour of silence, I went in to find them watching a regular broadcast football game in the 3D conversion. My son told me this week he's buying one for his apartment. We are sort of Sci-fi fans and we stuck in a DVD of the Star Gate SG1 series with the 3D conversion on and it was a whole new show.

When choosing the 3D mode, I see many variations of 3D, but they are side to side or top and bottom.  Just strange and so I am \"assuming\" that those are for different active shutter glasses.

This has turned out useful since my blu-ray player is having problems connecting wirelessly to our network.  So far we've watched Netflix streaming movies through this TV without any problems.  The TV home screen was easy to navigate to setup Netflix.The only downside to this TV was the volume.  It doesn't get nearly loud enough even at 100%.  Considering this is in our main living room area with a lot of distractions, this would be a problem.  However, I hook all of our home entertainment system through a surround sound system.... so it's a non issue for us after all, hence I didn't dock any stars from the rating.

XBOX ONE LOOKS AMAZING! 3D and Non 3D Look AMAZING! I LOVE THE OPTION OF BEING ABLE TO TURN EITHER A TV SHOW OR A MOVIE INTO 3D That Otherwise Wouldn't Be Seen In 3D.. PLAYING XBOX ONE GAMES and Being able to TURN THE GAMES INTO 3D IS AWESOME, AND IT IS GOOD 3D!!  Still these few years later and I Would Not Trade these Tvs for Any Other Tv, or the Sony type of 3D!! From Grandparents to  Nieces, the 3D hasn't given Anyone Headaches.. Maybe it's different with a few amount of people, But The Non Powered Glasses 3d LG Uses Doesn't hurt your head like the Other type or even maybe the 3D in Movie Theaters..  BUT EVEN IF YOU DIDNT EVER WANT TO USE THE 3D OPTION, THE Regular 2D ON THIS MODEL IS AMAZING!! Detail from Action Movies, Fast Paced Games, and Even Cartoon Disney Blu Ray Movies, THEY ALL LOOK AMAZING!! I Love Both my 55\" and the 47\" I just wished I would've went for the 65\"!! This Tv Has Everything That you Will need for any Home Entertainment Setup!! believe Me, I Have Used a Wide Variety of Gear with this TV platform, and it has handled Everything Amazingly !!!  * Any Questions, let me know! **** Old Review.. -  I Have Had the 55\" (55LW6500) for About 2 Months, And This Tv Is Amazing!! When I was Looking for a Tv to Buy, This TV Had SoO MANY GREAT REVIEWS!  The ONLY THING THAT WORRIED ME WAS A REVIEW FROM SOMEONE SAYING THAT THE TV HAD SOME LAG WHILE PLAYING VIDEO GAME. (XBOX 360/PS3..) THAT WOULDVE BEEN A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME AND ALOT OF PEOPLE NOW!! I AM VERY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THE PROBLEM WAS ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE I EVEN BOUGHT/RECEIVED MY TV...  THERE WAS AN UPDATE WAITING TO BE DOWNLOADED USING THE PROVIDED WIFI CARD.. DOWNLOAD THE UPDATE, AND NO MORE LAG, EVERY GAME / MOVIE, NO MATTER HOW FAST PACED LOOKED AMAZING!!  I Do Recommend Looking Online for the Best Possible In Depth TV Picture / Audio Settings, You Don't Have to Be A TV Tech to Change the Settings of each Option to the Numbers Provided Online, And Once You Change the Picture to the Optimal Settings Found Online From People who Probably Spent Hours Figuring out the Best Possible Setting... THEN YOU WILL HAVE THAT MUCH BETTER PICTURE QUALITY FROM YOUR NEW TV!!  Every Tv Comes from the Factory Not  Properly Calibrated, But No one really thinks about that.. Your Picture will look Awesome Once You Change the Settings!!  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A TV 65\", 55\", or 47\" I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THE LG LW6500 series of TVs!! ( I Wish I wouldve put the extra money out for the 65\"! Because these tvs are amazing! These are some of the clearest tvs I have ever seen and I used to sell TV's, (no I dont work for LG or anyone I am just very happy with my purchase!).  Don't Listen to the PeopleWho Say that the Other Type of 3D is Better (with the Powered Glasses..) , THOSE ARE TINY  SCREENS FLICKERING INFRONT OF YOUR EYES TO BRING YOU THE 3D EFFECT, AND THAT TYPE IS WHAT CAUSES MOST PEOPLES HEADACHES..  THIS LG LINE OF 3D TVS IS THE OPPOSITE TYPE OF 3D (there's ACTIVE AND PASSIVE..) and with the regular 3D Glasses, you have Nothing powered Which Means No Huge Heavy Glasses Starting the Headache, and the Insane Flickering Throughout the Movie Finishing off your huge Headache..  But with this TV, ITS THE VERY LIGHT 3D GLASSES, VERY INEXPENSIVE COMPARED TO THE POWERED GLASSES, AND THIS TYPE WILL NOT GIVE YOU A HEADACHE LIKE MOST POWERED 3D TVS..  AND IF YOU ONLY WANT IT FOR 2D REGULAR TV OR MOVIE PURPOSES, IT STILL LOOKS AMAZING!! Either HDTV Or HD MOVIES / GAMES..

The 2D to 3D conversion is decent at best, it offers very little depth and isn't worth the hassle of pulling out the glasses. I did appreciate the 3D to 2D conversion.

While LG was less expensive than D7000 - the extra money  were not as important as getting the best unit and features I wanted. I really liked passive 3D, the handy wand remote and overall color on LG being more life-like. I have been a long time fan of Samsung products. However, for some reason  color pallet on Samsung's latest TVs feels too artificial, overly vivid and not life-like. I'm sure it can all be fine tuned manually, I don't have time and don't want to bother.Amazon did a great job with delivery.The unit was very well packed and installation was intuitive:Here quick pros and cons of the TVPros:- Great 2D quality- Plenty of online content. In addition to Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime - LG offers lots of 3rd party apps for download free. There is an  app for listening radio stations worldwide. TV dims by itself while playing the radio station. A well thought out feature.- Considering the thin format - good strong sound with lots of options- Magic wand remote is intuitive and works very well. If the 'wand' remote had 'exit' button and  shortcuts of the regular remote, I don't I'd every be using the regular remote.- Passive 3D - no hassle with bulky/cusomized 'powered' glasses. Came in cool four colors to help people memorize their glasses. Very inexpensive to add more for larger group of people. Can even use glasses from movie theater.- Angle viewing - I'm surprised at how wide angle of viewing I can achieve before seeing any decay in quality, both in side and top/bottom.- Initial setup is easy. Boot up also walks you through an easy custom color/brightness tuning.- Razor thin format- Quality finishes and look. Unlike other brands, LG's logo is not intrusive. Lit buttons can be tuned off.- Includes wireless usb card which was very easy to setup- Lots of outputs/inputs- I discovered that LG has a superb 24/7 customer service which tried to help me and even though the issue was with my internet provider.- Ambient light auto-adjust feature.Cons:- It's not just LG but all brands - more thought should be given as to where HDMI and ethernet jacks are positioned. When TV is wall mounted flush on a very shallow mount reaching some input/output jacks might be difficult- In addition to prior point - power plug should be flat/low profile. This way it can be plugged into outlet directly behind the TV if it's mounted- Wish there was a way to switch between online streaming to cable tv w/o having to exit streaming.All in all great product which I'd endorse.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good HDTV", "Author": "Rajashekher V.

Attach the stand and you may very well not be able to remove it in the future due to an apparent mismatch between the drilled holes and the screws provided.This is an important consideration if you are planning on possibly wall mounting the set at some time in the future. My LG TV was returned to Amazon with the stand still attached for this very reason; it simply could not be removed once it had been attached.2) WIFI implementation via external dongle with suboptimal throughput - the LG would repeatedly ask me to establish my Internet connection when this had been done successfully a long time ago. Establishing and maintaining a connection should not be a problem for this LG television when 10 Mbps are available on the wireless network and the connection to all other participating devices (PC, printer, Internet radio, etc.) is rock solid.3) The second remote provided with the LG is essentially superfluous; there's rarely a need for more than one remote per electronic device. Why unnecessarily contribute to the multiplication of remotes around the house?4) Both LG remotes also did interfere with some other electronic devices that I have in my living room, turning them on and/or off when this was not desired (digital picture frame, Internet radio, etc.). Panasonic and Toshiba remotes do not cause this problem.I ended up getting the comparable passive 3D Toshiba television instead (Toshiba 47TL515U 47-Inch Natural 3D 1080p 240 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Net TV, Black) and have been very satisfied with its great picture quality and its flawless - albeit quirky - performance since my acquiring it in July 2011.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Be careful, No real adobe flash support and their youtube app shows inappropriate videos for family", "Author": "Oklahoma man", "ReviewID": "R3DMZMHD0XIM5V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have no problems with the hardware. I bought this TV because it is supposedly \"smart\" and I can use it to surf the internet.Well, for $ 1000 dollar plus, you expect that LG would support Adobe flash player. The LG claims that their TV supports version 8. But it seems most websites require version 9 or 10. LG and for the last probably six months did not care to upgrade or their hardware can not work with the latest versions of Adobe. Therefore, you will find most of your favorite webs that requires flash will not work. So, if you are buying LG because you mainly want to enjoy the internet content, find another device. I have to say, however, that their Netflix apps is working perfectly fine. Remember, though, that you are paying a $ 1000 plus to have more than watching Hulu and Netflix.Now to problem number two, LG has a pre-installed youtube app, the first time I opened at home, I was sitting excited with my family to watch youtube, Once I started the youtube app, it started immediately showing ad where a man was showing his (penXX- a toy penXX) and few women wearing bikini. My kids saw that!!. It kept happening every time I open the pre-installed Youtube app.I went and googled this issue trying to find out how I can fix this and I have found many consumers complained about the same problem for the last few months but LG did not bother to fix it. Now, I am worried that my 4 and 5 yr old kids would open the Youtube app again and find these inappropriate scenes.Until  LG fixes the flash player issue and fix the inappropriate contents shown by their Youtube apps, I would not recommend this product if you are looking for \"smart\" TV.

Retail price seems abusive to me.This TV has a very good picture quality, high tech features and absolutely superb passive 3D technology, which is for me the most impressive feature (even I don't plan to use it compulsively) since at this point very few manufacturers are able to offer it (LG, Toshiba). 3D passive technology IS the way active glasses are going to end up. I'm firmly convinced of that.Having said that, the bad is that the default picture settings are absolutely wrong and they are going to make you think that your new LED TV is worse than your old LCD.The default picture is literally dead, grey and souless. I had to configure it manually by maximizing the vividness, and is not easy since there are several parameters to consider. So be prepared to spend some tuning time.In the same sense, you can not make use of the 'Intelligent Sensor' feature that I used to have turned on in my previous TV that automatically adapts the brigthness and contrast to the lighting conditions of the room. Is absolutely erratic and exaggerated the way it kills the vividness of the image. Is annoying and useless.So I firmly recommend to avoid the sensor, find your own settings for vivid whites and deep blacks and keep them constant.I don't need internet TV because I use an HTPC and a Cable set top box, so the TV acts mainly as a PC monitor, but for someone without PC could be kind of useful at certain point, not for regular use.User Interface, menus, options... I think they are frankly quite good. Good job.This TV comes with 2 remotes: the 'classic' and the 'wii-style' remote-mouse. You can do everything with the 'wii' and is much more intuitive, practical and cool so you don't even need to unpack the other one. Save the AA batteries for your nightstand alarm clock.So to make the long story short:Good:- Very good picture (when tuned properly) and feature set.- State of the Art TV technology.- Reasonable price.- Better sound than expected for a so flat TV.- The 3D passive stuff. It really works, so this makes the other systems pointless.- Interactive GUI with 'wii' remote, practical solution for TV and internet menus.Bad:- Default picture settings, 'Intelligent sensor' and 'energy saver'.- passive 3D can also cause sickness, nausea, dizziness like any other 3D system. So don't be fooled about it.- rear panel does not have stereo RCA output (see my review for \"FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter\")- Not as aesthetically stunning like frameless Samsungs, but nice anyway, neutral.- It is not a 55''", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Honest opinion", "Author": "hef321", "ReviewID": "R1VT8V47ML5GW6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So I have only used this TV for 2 days.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good TV and I got a really good price on it so I shouldn't complain much.

They are uneven too.  Some parts have more and some parts have none.  It can be very annoying when watching dark themes.  Calibration doesn't do anything at all.Second Star - While watching darker scenes and with \"vivid\" picture setting, the scene get slightly brighter than darker. It almost seems like it doesn't know how much light to give it. It goes just on and off during the dark scenes.Third Star - I play game a lot so maybe I am a little sensitive in this area.

It also has inbuilt 3D conversion so you do not need to buy extras to have 3D experience.2) It has Smart TV and Apps.3) It has magic motion remote to browse through internet, apps and other stuff.4) It also has Motion 240 Hz which makes the video really smooth.The only drawback it has is that when you are using it in 3D mode, it drops the resolution of the screen to half of the original video.

We could not have imagined HOW much better this tv looked.  The quality is superb.  I often just put the passive glasses on, flip on the 2D -> 3D mode, and watch stuff in 3D.  More than I thought I would.  The tv has a large number of cool features including the energy saver that dims the image at night with 3 levels you can set.Some of the things I don't really find that useful are the LG Apps and magic motion remote.  The remote has to be used just right and drifts a lot otherwise.  The apps I downloaded took so long (failed repeatedly) that I didn't even bother starting one after I had picked a few, didn't look all that interesting.  The sound quality of the speakers is what you would expect, not great, not terrible though if the tv is mounted solidly to the wall.After having some time to install a new sound system, the HDMI ARC feature works nicely.  However, a huge disappointment (and I knocked off a star because of this) as mentioned elsewhere on this board is the simplink which is supposed to control other external devices.  I use Tivo, and there is no way to set the tv up so that a single remote power button press will turn the TV on which will then turn the AVR on.Instead, LG resets the settings for simplink to the TV Speakers default every time you turn the TV on.  This has been a known issue, after some research, and LG stands by this design and refuses to modify it.  So, you turn the TV on, but it doesn't turn the AVR on because the AVR doesn't know that it is required, so technically HDMI-CEC is not fully supported if you ask me because of this.  The steps are to turn the TV on with whatever remote, then use the tv remote to select simplink, scroll down to the Speaker output, change it to Home Theater (every time), and then use the other remote from then on.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R4W7Q1DOS9LAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Time from order to delivery was very good, the TV is Great.

This time of year there are lots of flat screens on sale everywhere and for half the cost of this unit we could've had a plain jane LED flat screen, but we decided to bite the bullet and pay more for the 3D experience and I'm glad we did. I elected to purchase from Audio and Video Center - they were a tad cheaper than the Amazon Prime choice but I had to wait longer due to shipping. Since it's our Christmas gift to ourselves, that was no biggy.I can't say enough about the fine folks at Audio and Video Center and their support. I had a question about my purchase and they handled it courteously and promptly.Shipping was \"white glove\" delivery - the guy brought the TV in, helped me unpack and inspect it, gave me some pointers on flat screens - not what I expected and way above what you normally get from UPS or FEDex, lolNow for the TV - in a word - amazing! well made, sturdy, easy to use, and the picture quality is great. We've only had it about a week, but I wouldn't trade for it.We have not experienced 3D before - never been to a 3D movie. We currently only have one 3D PS3 game (Ratchet and Clank) to test that part with and wow, pretty nifty technology. We're looking forward to watching a 3D movie on it.I opted for the LG brand for two reasons - mainly because of the passive 3D technology - that big box store where you supposedly get best buys (but not necessarily the best advice) would have you believe that active is better than passive - and they start spewing all kinds of myths about the differences. Just do your research online - dig deep - you will find out otherwise. Sometimes it's more about perception and not technical specifications.My second reason for choosing LG was that this TV was at the top of the list by that trusted consumer reporting organization that we've all come to rely on. The only TV that was rated better (by 1 point) was $500-$600 higher and was active 3D. So that makes this LG model the top rated passive model tested. :-)The only bad (not really a bad, just not important to me) in my eyes is the whole \"smart TV\" idea and hype - sure it has built in software to access various online sources like Amazon Videos, Hulu, Netflix, etc. The YouTube app that LG uses on their TVs is pretty bad - auto plays some very weird videos that I have not selected - you can use your favorite search enG(oogle)ine to read about that.Using that built in \"smartTV\" software changes how you have to wire things together. Ours is wired basically as a monitor only (and with the internal speakers turned off) - we have DirecTV, and a PS3 hooked up to our surround system, so all audio is routed through it as well. Plus, we're \"out in the country\" so our broadband internet is marginal at best. To make use of the \"smart TV\" software in the TV - I would have no sound - without 1) using the speaker in the TV, or 2) route the audio out of the TV to my surround system - something I can (and may) do in the future. For now, the PS3 does Netflix (not that we use that) and YouTube.I guess my point is don't let the \"smartTV\" part of this TV sway your decision - on the surface it sounds great to have all that, but in our system, we probably won't use it - at least for now. We have talked about cutting the cord with DirecTV (those folks just keep raising their prices - but that's another soapbox best left for another time) - but when we get a better internet connection, we'll likely jump into the alternatives for video like this \"smartTV\" stuff.If I could do it all over, would I buy this TV again? yep, without hesitation. Would I buy from Audio and Video Center again? yep, without hesitation.EDIT: I forgot to mention the \"Magic Motion\" remote control - takes some getting used to, but it's the only remote I use for this TV - I installed the batteries in both remotes, but started using the magic motion remote - I have never even used the \"regular\" remote, so ended up just removing those batteries and stashing that remote in a safe place.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV - should know there are some bonus items in there", "Author": "Donghyun Kim \"ryan\"", "ReviewID": "R38EHTECRPKCIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm totally satisfied with this TV- great design- simple to use (not much menus but all that are necessary/basic)- passive 3D (personally I feel this passive 3d is much comfortable than active)- great bonus items (it comes with 4 of 3d glasses AND Wireless USB dongle LG AN-WF100)  - should use LG wireless USB dongle - no other USB wireless  - it was connected well in wireless WEP, WPA-PSK, WPA2-PSK mode- two remote  - additionally it comes with \"simple motion remote\" which operates like WII controller.- reasonably light weight (expected heavy but not)cons- lack of lg tv apps (frankly I didn't expect that many)- couldn't find webcam for Skype on TV- when PC is connected to VGA port (not HDMI), TV doesn't recognize it (if so, it show colorful icon in the menu)  - but it displays VGA PC well. just no menu colorization", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "retired", "ReviewID": "R1OAWH3ZMBO6O5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "treat tv , picture on tv is excellent in 2d and 3d. easy  to setup for internet. only one problem to upgrade firmware you have plug  not wirerless.

Because of the size of the TV, 240 HZ is ideal for 3D. For regular HD, the human eye cannot process anything higher than 120, but for 3D it makes a differece. The 3D quality was so uch better than the movie theater. It actually seems like it jumps out at you for your 3D movies. It also has a 3D button for your Netflix movies, or satellite TV or Bluray. This feature suprised me at how good it was. The quality of the 3D isn't quite as stunning as the labeled 3D movies, but then again, it wasn't filmed in 3D either. I like that you can use just regular 3D glasses and dont have to spend a fortune if you want to have friends over to watch your cool TV.Another favorite feature was the internet ft. Netflix, ect. The picture quality is so amazing. I also like the wand remote that funtions with motion, kind of like the Wii remote. It is so much easier to operate, and you dont; have to know the function of about 40 buttons that come on the regular remote. The TV does come with a regular remote, if your taste runs more towards the more complicated.Overall I really love the TV and am so glad that I got it", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Average Citizen \"Kunto Panto\"", "ReviewID": "RVVPY536HEKSZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent TV, we are VERY happy with it.....it is an eye candy, easy to use, fast to boot/turn on....we'd buy it again", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "TV", "Author": "golferboy", "ReviewID": "R1UL71ST9395IS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV has  awesome picture, but the sound is not so good, sound is great when surround sound is on, but by itself it is poor at best, 3D is very good.  you would think for the price that you pay for this TV it would have better sound, thats why I could not give it five stars", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG55LW6500", "Author": "Dave S.", "ReviewID": "R3EEGCOH1S9BA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LG is the only brand of TV I will buy and this TV, the LG55LW6500, has LG setting a new standard that other brands are lacking in.

This is (was) an Internet connected TV, and LG periodically updates the firmware in the set. Well, they updated my firmware to 04.03.01 about two weeks ago, and it was a disaster! I can no longer connect to the Internet--no Netflix, Amazon, or access to the LG Apps built into the set. I called LG support last Thursday (4/19/2012) and the support person said \"This is a known problem and Engineering is working on it. The update 04.03.01 has a problem that prevents access to their server, and a new update is imminent by the next day at the latest.\" Well, it's now 4/23 with no fix. It's still a great picture, but the Internet interface was an important reason for making this purchase. What adds to the frustration is the lack of information on their website, and there's nothing I can find about the company's progress toward fixing the problem.I've had the TV for about two weeks, and there are a couple of surprises. An oddity about this product is that more sound is produced at the rear of the TV than from the front. I suspect this may have to do with the manner in which LG produces surround sound by relying on reflection from the surface behind the unit. However, my particular configuration has an open space behind the set. When seated in front, turning the volume up to maximum produces an insufficient sound level. I will say that the picture is brilliant given the right source or content. I bought a cheap digital indoor antenna to see what the off-air quality is like. It's better than my Comcast cable quality. However, there is only one input for \"either\" cable or an antenna connection. I had to order a coax switch to go between the two input sources.Some of the included LG applications don't work e.g. Vudu HD Movies and HuluPlus. There's a lot to this TV, and I haven't fully explored the capabilities. I'll report more as I go through the discovery process. I should have done a bit more research on what it takes for wifi capable TV. When attempting to view content from my PC via my wireless router, my router gets swamped. It's an older G-band router, so my next upgrade will be a max-performance N router. When I couldn't use the LG server installed on my PC, I thought I would outwit the technology by putting my digital photos on a USB flash drive and plugging it into one of the TV's USB ports. Nope, that was a dismal failure. The load time between each photo was so slow as to be unusable.I'm not too interested in 3D though the passive glasses work well. However, the 3D content from the included LG application is poor. The real test will be viewing Avatar on BluRay, which I consider the only quality 3D content available at this time.Word to the wise, do your homework and consider all the implications of upgrading one component of an integrated system.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG Infinia 47LW6500", "Author": "flyfisher", "ReviewID": "R2EUXH4S4IS3IE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This LG TV's picture quality is excelllent.

Some shows and movies don't pop out as much as others but it is still an awesome feature to have. The motion sensor wand is a nice idea as well. More convenient than having to do everything with the basic remote. It would be nice if you could connect a wireless keyboard to the TV though. As far as the apps go for the TV, some are cool but most didn't look that interesting to me. The media sharing app gave me a little bit of trouble and I'm still trying to figure out the whole Plex program, but overall I'm still satisfied. Many awesome features that will keep you busy for hours. It's a great conversational piece to show off all the things your television can now do as well.

I am extremely impressed. The picture quality is outstanding and the television has so many awesome features!A couple of set-up thoughts: When setup first asks to do auto search for channels, this isn't really necessary if you have a set top box. Indeed, if you have connected the LG to a set top box via HDMI, this step is meaningless, since you cannot use channel input in HDMI mode.Audio may be an issue for some. The sound is much less robust compared to the Panasonic, and I expected this, as the LG is so much thinner. I bought the LG knowing I would connect it to my AV audio system. Since the LG has digital audio out, I needed to buy a DAC (Digital to Analog converter) and a Toslink cable to send the LG's audio output to my system. A quick call to AudioAdvisor and my favorite advisor Joe D., and I had the necessary DAC and cable on the way.I opted for free shipping and the LG was delivered in pristine condition by Home Direct and their local affiliate.The LG Infinia 47LW6500 is the most incredible television I have ever watched, and I am so impressed with its features.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible", "Author": "Crunk Nasty", "ReviewID": "R301V2BLV2ITVI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After months of research I purchased an LG 50pz750 3d plasma tv.

I purchased all the cords and other accessories, exactly as was recommended. When I set up the television, none of the apps (such as Pandora, Vudu, Youtube) would not work.  I called LG and spent hours trying to get the issue fixed.  First LG said it was my router, so I got a new router. Then LG said it was my internet, so I got turbo internet.  Keep in mind, my router and internet work for all of the non LG products in the house such as Kindle, Ipad, Dell Laptop, Roku, and Apple TV.  Finally, after several weeks of this, LG agreed to send a technician out to my house to fix it. The technician spent about an hour trying to get it to work and concluded that it was \"unfixable\". He was using his own internet, router, etc. and he still could not get the TV or the Blu Ray to work.  I contacted the retail store and tried to return it, and they said my 30 day warranty was up. Keep in mind, it was only up because I was waiting for the LG tech to come to my house. I called LG and asked if they would refund it because their own technician declared that it was \"unfixable.\" They admit that the file indicates that the technician declared it unfixable, but they will not refund my money.  Basically, I'm just out of luck. I called an independent TV repair man to take a look at it. His advice to me was, don't ever buy LG.

We also wanted a TV with passive 3D capability so that we wouldn't need to use the cumbersome, heavy, battery-powered 3D glasses.Here are the good things: The image quality is fantastic, particularly in the HDTV channels. Absolutely stunning colors and sharp images. Setup was easy, although it took a bit to make it compatible with the Time Warner cable box. The \"magic remote\" is a bit awkward at times but ok. Navigation is pretty intuitive and simple. The 3D works well (the kids love it), although it's a bit flat on movies that were not produced in 3D, but that's to be expected. The 2D to 3D conversion does not move things toward you, but it adds sufficient depth to create the illusion of 3D, and it's still good enough to make it interesting. Also, things like Amazon videos work extremely well, both on wireless and Ethernet cable.The down side: It is a bit annoying that the TV does not automatically recognize its input source. Each time you use a different input, you have to manually switch it to that input. Also, the image ratio tends to be weird, mostly in movies. Why is it not possible to fill the whole width or height of the screen, whatever applies, and adjust the other one accordingly?! Instead, you either end up with a fat display or with an overall reduced screen size.More importantly, though, the internet browser is a joke. Yes, you can browse the internet with it, which puts this TV way ahead of its competitors from other brands, but the interface is absolutely pathetic, allowing you to do exactly three things: punching in a URL, defining favorites, and looking at your browsing history. No settings/options, no way to customize the browser or get an update for it (in fact upon calling customer service, I was informed that there's no update planned for the browser). Also, the internet loads mind-numbingly slowly, sort of like it was in the mid 90ies when everything was going through analogue modems. The browser can only play Flash 8 or below, which makes it impossible to view most of the flash-based internet content. Customer service informed me that higher Flash will not be available due to limited memory of this TV. Also, the RGB port that you can use to connect a computer to the TV does not seem to take every computer format, for whatever reason. I can play video content from my iPad, but it won't display anything from my Dell Laptop. Weird.I like to watch German movies and news through the internet and I was really looking forward to being able to play them on this TV. But unfortunately, it neither works through the TV's internal internet browser, nor through my laptop. Very disappointing.Apparently the developers thought it's enough putting a crappy and draggy browser into the TV to call it internet-ready.

That was the good news.  I bought this because I had a 37 in Sylvania 720 resolution HDTV that quite honestly had little difference between HD and regular channels (I have Comcast Cable with an HD box).  If you looked closely, I guess the names on the back of jerseys were sharper, but not much and definitely not a \"WOW!\" difference.  I figured it was the 720 vs 1080 part.  So, I was certain this tv would solve that.It did not.I got it set up and the wireless internet works and it does have a bigger picture.  Still can't tell much difference between HD and regular channels though. Maybe a 10% improvement, but certainly not worth the cost.  My Comcast box has a coax cable going into it.  I thought I could use an HDMI cable from the cable box to the TV.  However, when I ran the HDMI from the cable box and plugged it into an HDMI slot on the TV, there was no picture, no sound, no signal.  The only way I could get a picture was to run another coax cable from the cable box to the TV or from the cable box to a DVD player and then connect the DVD to the TV with an HDMI cable.  Bottom line, the HD is nowhere near what I had hoped for.Tried the Comcast folks and they weren't any help.  Tried LG and they weren't either.  I asked both if I should be able to run an HDMI cable from the cable box output to the TV HDMI input.  They never did answer the question.  This is the second cable box and it is HD capable, so it is unlikely I got 2 defects.Bottom line, I'm stumped on what to do to get that \"WOW\" picture.  As such, this is a large, tremendously overpriced TV that doesn't do near what I had hoped.  I could have got the same result for a fourth of the price or less.  Really disappointed with both Comcast and LG Customer support.Anyone out there have a tip on how to make this work?  I can't be the first to have a similar problem.Thanks.Edited 10/17/11Upgraded the stars to 4. Finally got the HD working after a call to LG and half a dozen calls to Comcast.  It really does depend on who you talk to.  Both companies had useless online help. Got the TV and Cable box both using HDMI and got an HD picture.  I can definitely tell the difference.  I'd give it 5 stars, but felt the owners manual is not very good.  Still haven't set up facebook or some other portions of the set's cababilies, but the manual sure isn't real helpful.  Once the TV is working, it does have a good picture and adequate sound.  Guess that's really what matters.  Thanks for the tips added to my review on how to get it working.

This TV mumbo jumbo is for  the purpose of misleading you into buying the set thinking it will have  a four times sharper image. Wait, the picture clarity is fantastic, brilliant, vivid, excellently superb.The 2D to 3D conversion is another overstatement. This TV may be able to convert 2D to 3D but the studios who make the DVD can not do it in this time frame. The LG can render 3D to 2D easily.This LED is lighter than the older plasma and LCD TVs.

Placing it on a wall is bad taste from a decorator's perspective and eliminates the set's mobility.The tuner is excellent for gathering channels.
