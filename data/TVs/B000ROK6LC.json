It paid for me to surf and found it at Sears for $30.00 cheaper than Circuit City, and I could pick it up so I saved shipping.Vizio VX32L 32\" Widescreen LCD HDTV with HDMI/ATSCI began my search for a larger LCD with HD that was not going to send me to the poor house.. I came across the Vizio VX32L and read the opinion/reviews from owners, and found that a lot of people seemed pretty satisfied with it, although, they paid a lot more because they bought when LCD's were much more expensive, so I figured if they were happy with it for the price they paid, then I should be OK with paying only $569.00.I picked it up and could not wait to get home to hang it on the wall and get the DVR & DVD player hooked to put it to the test.First thing I noticed is that I was not truly satisfied with the way the picture looked at first. So I went in & tweaked the settings to my liking. I found that to be odd, since most TV's come from the factory and the default settings are usually satisfactory, and only need minor adjustments. This one needed to be tweaked more than any other TV I've owned. However after going through the manual and learning what all the little settings were (most new to me), when I was done I was pretty satisfied.Now at first, I was using Standard Definition, which on most HDTV's doesn't always look like what people are used to seeing. So I used a nice DVD using progressive scan with Component Hook-ups. Now that brought out more of what this TV can deliver, and actually made me happy with my purchase right then & there.The next test was to go to HD, so I used my HD-DVR, and hooked up the HDMI cable. All I can say is, WOW! The sharp crisp crystal clarity REALLY stood out now. This was the ultimate test to see what this thing was truly capable of, and I knew that I made a smart choice.Now, can this TV deliver what the big names can? No, but it's pretty darn close, and that's why you pay $570-$600 instead of $1500-$2000. A Great value for the money. It has a contrast of 1200:1, which I think should be a good minimum to go by if you like realistic viewing without dark spots becoming impossible to make out. This one is bright, and can deliver some good clear full motion video. Sure you can buy a Sony for a TON more $$ with 10,000:1 contrast, but most people don't have that kind if dough to throw around for TV.The menus are very simple, and it has plenty of settings to tweak this puppy to your liking. I do advise reading the manual for this part, because it had settings that normal TV's do not, and can be kind of confusing to the \"Electronically Challenged\" folks out there. Also, read the online forums that deal with this set, you'll learn a lot from it.The sound that comes out of the built in speakers is great for a bedroom, but if you like thunderous surround, then you'll need a separate surround receiver. But for my bedroom, it's perfectly fine, and actually has a pretty good simulated surround that comes out nice & clear.The set is attractive, I really like the look of it, and the fact that it can be wall mounted was real positive for me. Now for some, depending on the location of viewing, you might be better off placing it on a dresser, and angling the view. I know when I rearrange my bedroom, I'm not going to keep it on the wall, because it does not appear like it will be the ideal viewing angle. You can buy an expensive wall mounting hardware, that will twist, swivel, pan, etc., but whether you'll need it or not will all depend on viewing location.I do like the input selections, it gives me options I've never had. For instance, it not only has HDMI, but it had 2. It also has 2 component video connections, 2 AV hookups, one with S-video, and it also had the standard coax for those who can enjoy true over the air uncompressed HD signals that will blow you away. This set has an ATSC tuner for just that purpose. As you shop around for flat panels, you'll want to make sure it comes with that (as some don't) if you want to enjoy over the air HDTV. It also has QAM built in so that some people can eliminate set top boxes for cable. You can also use this set as PC monitor if you choose, which some day I'm going the try out. It will be so much easier to read the screen in 32\" instead 17\" like I have now.The remote is decent, and like all new ones take some getting used to. Of course I'd like some of the button in other locations, but I think that of all my remotes.The Picture in Picture is nice, and unlike my HD rear projection, I do not have to worry about side bar burning in to the screen. The MFG. guarantees that no screen burn in can happen with this set, which puts my mind at ease when my kids pause the DVD player for hours at a time!All in all for the money I believe I got a GREAT deal.

Even at 100 I could barely hear the thing. I'd misplaced the receipt and so I was resigned to just using it as a computer monitor.

They were helpful to the point of being almost annoying (great and unbelievable) They were going to send out a technician, then decided to send out a small gizmo instead. I was instructed to connect the small box to the RJ-11 service port on the back of the TV, press the start button on the box, wait for the green light to turn orange, then wait 15 minutes for it to turn green again, disconnect the box, unplug the TV for 15 to 20 seconds, plug it back in again, turn the TV on and test the volume.Wow...it worked as advertised. Before I could barely hear the thing with it turned up to 100, now it is too loud at 40!!! I'll buy one of these again. The customer service people kept calling me to be sure that the problem was fixed. I asked them if they wanted me to send their gizmo back...Reply: \"No, keep it.

Donofrio", "ReviewID": "RB8AV1IJF2R5R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I work at Sears as a TV salesmen and im a college student. So I know a few things about televisions. I am one of the better part time salesmen in our store but anyways.Being a college student, I didn't have alot of money to throw around. Im 18 years old and wanted an HDTV to play my Xbox 360 on. All I have to say is I made the right decision.Being around TVs for 6 to 8 hours straight can get annoying but it does give you alot of time to look at each set and see the differences in quality and price.The best two looking television in the 32 range LCD are obviously the Sony Bravia KDL-32S3000 32\" 720p LCD HDTV sets or the Samsungs. Yes they do look better but they by no means look $400 better than the Vizio. So weighing out all my options and wanted to stay under the $700 range it was either the Vizio, Sylvania, or the Olevia. This was the no brainer of the year. The Vizio looks so much better than both these sets and the worst thing is the Vizio is cheaper than the Sylvania.I also got a great deal on it. For one the signing manager was told to put the old display Vizio on closeout and a new one in its place. I was like I wanna buy this TV tonite so he put the new one outta the box on closeout and left the old one there. So I got a 629 dollar Tv for about 500 plus my associate discount.Once I brought the TV home I was immediatly satisfied. Going from a 13 inch SDTV (although it was LCD) to a 32 inch HD TV was incredible. After tweakings of the settings my 360 games looked just as good as they do on my uncles Samsung. This shows that if you are technically able you can spend far less on a TV and with some setting adjustments make it look like a 1000 dollar set.There are some reasons I gave this TV a four though. For one the sound isn't very good. I use a surround sound system by Yamaha that was about the smae price of the TV haha. If you don't have a surround sound I do suggest you turn off the Simulated surround sound in the menu. It waill make the TV sound a little better. The only other negative with hte television are in dark movie scenes they tend to look a little muddy. Not horrible but not as good as they should.All in all at 599-629 (500 with tax for me ;) ) dollars this is a great Televison set. I do suggest if yuou buy this at least buy the 300 dollar Yamaha home theatre system with an included reciever.

We look at all the mid-priced brands, and even those such as Sony & Samsung. The best picture we saw was the 32\" Samsung, there was no equal in my opinion. However, the difference between the Vizio @ $598 (Sears) and the Samsung $899 (Sears)was not hard. The Vizio set is very thin compared to Olevia (very thick)and the picture quality appeared to be much better. I hooked up a cheap DVD player using AV and it looked very nice. Then I hooked up digital cable, and \"most\" channels looked fine. I have not hooked up any HD signals yet, but I am happy with the picture quality. The onscreen menus are very nice, and the Picture-in-Picture (PIP) is nice with the exception that I cannot use the same signal twice, so I have to hook up two different cable signals twice to get PIP (I know very little about PIP technology, so this might be normal). 720p is fine, considering there are only 1 or 2 32\" LCD's with 1080p and you also will pay about $1500 or more for those sets. Overall, I am happy with this television, it is perfect for a master bedroom or for those on a tight budget for this family room. For as much as TV technology has changed lately, why pay $600+ for a LCD, when it will most likely be outdated and overpriced in 6 months.

I was weary about purchasing from the Vizio brand since they're known for being the 'budget-minded' flat-screen maker - but my cousin had the same model for the past 2 years and is pleased with the quality for the price.  Of course it's not a high-end maker, but I wanted to use the LCD primarily as a computer monitor.That said - I took home a lemon that required a service tech to come out and replace the motherboard within the 2nd month of owning the TV.  After that - the exact same issue went unresolved 3 weeks later (black areas started turning neon-green again).  I eventually had to pay shipping out-of-pocket to send the TV back to Vizio - where they then made clear in the purchase agreement that they will replace the TV with a refurbished one - and also only honor the remaining time left on the original purchase warranty or up to 90 days if the warranty is already expiring (1 year from the original TV purchase) i.e. they can replace the TV with a used refurbished one that they won't stand behind like they would a new one (The original TV didn't even last 2 months - which still worries me with this refurb)Bottom line:  I paid full price for a new TV and ended up with a refurb.  So beware with Vizio.  Cheap price = cheap parts, no money for quality assurance, and no high-end features/picture quality - but that's the risk you take when you have better Vegas odds with a Toshiba or Samsung, etc. in avoiding a lemon and getting nicer features, but have to pay more money upfront.So far, the refurb functions nicely as a computer monitor and occasional TV - but what a shame to pay full-price for a new TV and end up with a used one - and also go through the multiple headaches of trying to either get it fixed, or replaced when you simply just bought the darn thing.All in all - I'm okay with my decision because I couldn't justify purchasing a nice Samsung LCD to be used for a computer monitor - I knew the risks and odds when I made the purchase and spent what I wanted to spend for the screen size and quality - it's just too bad that I rolled the dice and came out with a loss - but still hoping that I can come out ahead if this thing doesn't crap out on me for several years.  *Knock on wood*", "Date": "December 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "Johnny Murphy", "ReviewID": "RY2YL9NMA1DEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased for $599 @ Circuit City and the set was on sell the next day for $569.

This is crazy! So now I have to sell my regular version and cop the Blu-Ray version. Games also look amazing. The sound quality is really good too. Has real loud and clear sound and that's wihtout having to actually BLAST the TV, I put mines on about 25-30 volume level and its freaking loud and I think the TV can go up to about 60 in volume level, in not too sure because I didn't need to put it that high. I don't have a HDMI cable either, but I have the HD components for my 360 and i have the monster cables for my PS3 and their graphic detail on the TV is really good. I was really blown away playing Halo 3, Heavenly Sword and Call Of Duty 4. Its only a 720p/1080i TV, but the pitcure still looks great if you tweak it a little in the menu. The TV has 2 HDMI components in the back, but seriously, I don't think that it will actually make a noticable difference with a 1080i TV. You may just need to upgrade to a 42\" 1080p TV if you want to noticable see a difference. But i went with the 32\" because I thought the 37\" or 42\" would be too big for my room ,but now i wish i went with the 37\" but I don't really think it would have made a difference in my satisfaction because it will just increase the screen size, not the resolution (like 1080i to 1080p) but the 32\" is a good size for small to medium size rooms and the picture is great. Bottom line, im glad i brought this tv because its great, cheap and worth buying if your on,a budget. I really don't see how you can be unsatisfied with this TV unless your looking to buy a 1080p TV. I Love it and I think you would too!", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good as a starter HDTV", "Author": "J. F.

After a few months here is what we think about this tv.Pros:  Looks nice.  Light weight.  Number of inputs.  Picture quality is good.  Price (got it for $599)I'm not going to call these \"cons\" because they are just slight imperfections on the tv.  I have started to noticed a bit of blurring but it really isn't a big deal to me because of what I tv I had before.  The audio is what seems to be the major problem with this tv.  I have an antenna (coax), cable box (component) and a xbox 360/xbox hd dvd(component).  The sound over the antenna coax cable is normal and loud.  The sound on the cable box component cables is a bit muted it seems. When I play games on the 360, the volume is a little louder than the cable box but still not as loud as the coax tv.  When I watch movies on the 360 and/or the hd dvd drive the volume is really muted to where we have to honestly put the volume past 90 (out of 100) to get the sound loud enough.  I do not have anything that uses HDMI so I cannot comment on that.Overall, we are very happy with this tv and would recommend it to anyone on a budget.  I am going to add a budget home theatre at the first of the year to see if that solves the problem.  I also wanted to say that I have NOT tried customer service to see if they can fix the audio or if it is just a flaw with the tv.", "Date": "December 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "**WARNING** Please Read!!!", "Author": "J.

Through HDMI and VGA no problems known.Vizio doesn't manufacture anything themselves, they buy parts from other manufacturers and just assemble the left over pieces. Kind of like eating the floor sweepings of a hot dog factory (HAHA).

Setup was quick and simple.  Less than quality picture on regular analog sdtv, but viewable. Looking forward to upgrading to HD cable. Once I hooked it to my pS2 and toshiba HD DVD player on the 1080i setting,the picture and sound was totally awesome. Receive a few on the air HD channels;reception great! My regular DVD videos are crisp and clear. Absolutely recommend to anyone who's in the market for an lcd hdtv of this magnitude: great new name,product and value.

That being said, many people are buying this tv because of its price.  They arent stopping to notice (I have for days now returning to the store to test it for hours) that the volume on this set is awful.  When you increase the volume, its gets tinny, isnt loud enough and worse, has gaps in level where nothing happens except the level/number onscreen increases without a concurrent increase in sound.  Its also got very low ratios and, for the life of me, I cannot understand why people are in such a rush to buy this inferior set.  Lets hope that as 2008 proceeds and we rush closer to Feburary 2009 (when analog signals will be a challenge to pull out of the air) that someone else, maybe even Vizio, will produce a better tv set for us all.This one is NOT it, sorry.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Vizio VX32L 32\" Widescreen LCD HDTV with HDMI/ATSC", "Author": "G.

Another problem is that the volume for the TV will be way higher from that of a device that has been inputed like a dvd player, tivo, playstation, etc..... Gets anoying.
