{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good buy!", "Author": "S. Diphillipo \"SobahMummy\"", "ReviewID": "R2MB2Y43LRNIKE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was looking to trade up from my old big clunker of a tube TV to a new streamlined flat screen, and after all the investigating (there were hours of it) I decided on this Westinghouse 40'. It was the cheapest in it's category, and out of all the stores and web sites I tried. The only other place who had it for $299.00 was Best Buy, but on Amazon I got to save myself the $20.00 in tax ( I live in Taxachussetts). I have had it for over a month now with no issues so far. There were a lot of reviews that mentioned issues with the volume, I have no problem with my volume not being loud or good enough. With all that said, I would recommend this as a good TV to invest in at a very cheap price. Not top of the line, but has everything that the top of the line televisions do. Good luck in your choice.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "happyshopper", "Author": "robert cornfield", "ReviewID": "RRHJ49PPZMS0S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV right out of the box.

Littlefield \"littleneil\"", "ReviewID": "R2X9XOVAV7NJ06", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from someone other than Amazon. The TV arrived with a non working IR sensor out of the box. Neither my \"cable company\" remote or the \"new TV's remote\" would turn the TV on/off or adjust the volume - something my cable technician said was a bad IR sensor - for sure. The box states you are supposed to contact the manufacturer, not the reseller - and I did. On a Saturday - no technicians were available. On Monday, Westinghouse's  customer service representatives insisted that I try a new TV remote - which would arrive in 5-7 business days by regular mail. No surprize - when it arrived it didn't work either. So Westinghouse wanted me to box up the TV and send it back for a replacement (5-7 more days) and they would send me a replacement TV (another 5-7 more days).  Fortunately the reseller took pitty on me and accepted the return of the TV. The good news to report is that I thought the the TV was a good buy and the HD picture was pretty good.  The knock is on the manufacturer and how they handle customer problems. There will be no Westinghouse products in my home any time soon.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money.", "Author": "No need to reply back", "ReviewID": "R3JE9L5ZNCIZKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my parents as a gratitude give for have such nice parents.
