I don't have cable, use Roku to watch programs.  This tv was for the exercise room.  The tv arrived, I assembled and placed  it in 5 minutes, took another 30 seconds to hook up Roku and was watching.  Simple, easy, my kind of electronic.  My old tv had a volume limit that often couldn't be heard over active exercise equipment.  The sound on this tv is a huge improvement; at half volume it can easily be heard over the equipment.  It was a good price, got it within 2 days.  I'm totally happy with it.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great deal!!!", "Author": "Charlotte A.

It has a good picture. My problem is that I have been unable to connect my DVD player. The TV included no directions at all.  The web site is no help at all. I called the number provided and after a very long wait, I got someone who did not speak English. I searched the internet for some one who could help with the problem to no avail.  I tried to download a users guide but their directions did not match what my TV had on it. There was also a charge to download some of the users guides. I will not buy that brand again.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "I's so glad I waited to purchase this 50 inch Sony HDTV.", "Author": "Eugene M.

I use it for a computer monitor and works very well.  I purchased on sale so the price was really excellent (my opinion).

She lives in a remote area that cannot get cable, nor even digitized broadcast, and the cost of satellite service was out of the question. So all this TV will be used for is to play DVDs.I set it up for her myself, which was not too difficult. I might add here, assembly of the included stand requires a Phillips-head screwdriver. The whole, from opening the box to putting the TV in place, took maybe 10 minutes,Let me add: Beneath all the shiny black plastic, the stand includes a steel plate and steel bracket. It's plenty sturdy, so her worries of her housecats knocking it over were groundless.Setting up the TV initially was more of a nuisance. You must use the Arrow keys (on the included remote control) to make your choices, then press Enter for each. But you have to be careful, because the Arrow keys do not respond nearly as quickly as the Enter key. So you have to be...very...patient, and watch the onscreen menu closely, else you'll have to start all over (I did, twice).The picture and audio both looked good when it was set up and running. This is supposedly one of those 'backlit' TVs, which adds to the picture, but since I viewed it next to a window during full daylight I can say nothing of that feature. Either way, both color and brightness looked excellent, as they should with a DVD the only source.So far, so good, and the price was definitely attractive too. I first deducted a star for the item's name. It says, as you'll see above, \"720p.\" That means 720 pixels per square inch, not 1040 pixels, which is \"high definition.\" Yet it also says \"HDTV,\" meaning \"high-definition television.\" Well, it can't be both, can it? And it's not. This is not a true high-definition television set.But it's still a great set and I believe my senior friend will be excited with her introduction to wide-screen home entertainment. For the price, it'd be a five-star TV, if only they'd drop that misleading and inaccurate \"HD\" from the name.But there's this: I chose this set for my friend based on an earlier review which seemed to suggest the remote control was appropriate for elders of failing eyesight and fluttering fingertips. I am happy to say, this set's remote control is well-suited for persons of years, being of largish size, with big, clearly distinct and clearly labeled buttons. If you were looking for a set for use by a senior, why, this is the one you want. So I've added the final star back in, for its EZ-2-Use remote control.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$526.99", "Features": "Refresh Rate: 60Hz (Native)\nBacklight: LED (Edge-lit)\nSmart Functionality: No\nDimensions (W x H x D):  TV without stand: 44.2'' x 26.1\" x 2.9\", TV with stand: 44.2'' x 27.6'' x 8.5''\nInputs: 2 HDMI, 1 USB Video, 1 Composite, 1 Component\nAccessories Included: Standard remote", "Name": "Toshiba 50L1400U 50-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515DShF5NEL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00I0S70CK"}}
