The picture quality is amazing as well.I went from a 47\" Vizio to this LG and its a world of difference!!..The colors are very vibrant and the black is dense.The adjustments and settings are very easy to use and can make a world of difference!!..Especially if you find the codes for THX settings!! The sound is ok,for this one.I would say its the only thing that could use use some improvement. Overall this TV is the best bang for the buck!!..I have owned about 15 LCD/LED tv's and so far, this is one of the best by far!!", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Reason LG is Winning", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "RSQ80Q30QI89X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While Panasonic, Sony and Samsung all battle each other for who's TV is best, LG saving the money and passing it on to the user, specifically me. This TV is loaded with everything you would expect in a 2012 TV minus the fads or undeveloped programs. This one caught my eye because it is so thin and the price is amazing. The bezel on it is very thin and the TV without the stand is under a inch and a half thick. I bought this to replace my old dinosaur of a Sharp TV (also an under-rated brand). It is still a great TV, but at almost 6inches wide it was a heavy best. This TV, although not recommended, I am able to hold in one arm it is so thin and light.The picture is great, but I am never a huge fan of edge lit LED as they always appear lighter/whiter at the edges. It isn't a huge deal expect a really dark scene in a movie, and is most noticeable when loading a game or movie and the input is blank. The screen should be black but is grey around the edges. That was a rather large rant, but it is not by any means a turn off from this TV.I am a big fan of LG Simplink, although not flawless it easily allows the connection of a surround sound unit with only a few button pushes on the remote. I do appreciate the picture calibrator, but I found some user adjustments were still needed as the TV couldn't get it quite right.The sound is pretty weak on the TV itself, but that is almost expected these days. I simply got a sound bar to go with it and it suffices for the sized room this TV is in.Pros:+Amazon Price+Thin Bezel and Thin Body+Great 1080p pictureCons:-Underwhelming sound-LED Edge lightingOverall you would be lucky to find a better built TV in this price range.

It is very good: clear picture plus decent sound..  It's not the best tv out there, but probably the best valus for the money.  I gave it 4 stars because:- this tv replaced a 5 year old Samsung that had developed black streaks on half the picture (probably the backlight going out). This tv doesn't have as many outputs as the replacement.  Only way to hook to an external stereo system is through optical cord, which I understand doesn't pass through full 5.1 stereo.- no earphone jack (old Samsung had one)- for some reason, can't program my existing AT&T; Uverse remote to operate the new tv.  So we have 2 remotes, one for Uverse channels & box, and the LG remote for tv on/off and volume.  Just a little nuisance.- very easy to put together and set-up.  Had to tweak the picture several times, but ended up going with the included \"wizard\" settings, which produces a good picture with very little work.- out of the box, the sound does sound a little tinny.  Had to tweak this a little as well through the audio \"clarity\" settings.- this tv has led lighting, which does produce more color \"pop\" than the Samsung it replaced.Probably could have found a better tv with more features and better sound, but for the money, this is a good buy.  (Also, just happened to buy it 1 day before Amazon started charging Texas residents sales tax, so saved a little money there).Update: December 17, 2012I was able to set up my system to have full 5.1 pass through my stereo system. So this is not an issue.After 5 months, picture is still incredible. Programming AT&T; Uverse remote still an issue, but only a minor nuisance.  Still very happy with the purchase.  This is a great tv, especially for the price.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV", "Author": "Dan Laskowski", "ReviewID": "R3ISGEYDYK7CHL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this TV from a local electronics store; my wife and I are very very pleased with it! I was looking at either this TV or the Panasonic TC-L47E50. Fortunately I was able to compare the two side-by-side in store, and the LG looked much better. Sound is decent for a flat-panel TV.

It's an LG.Why are people buying 3D TV's? Visuals on this LG seem to come out the screen! The bonus no need for glasses which eventually HURT my eyes.I plug my laptop into 1 of many HDMI ports, and It's a Smart tv, Cable, Games, etc.I truly doubt I'll ever go to the theater, pay for cable, or buy another TV again.

The HDTV was purchased through Amazon and delivered/setup by CEVA.When I ordered the HDTV, I selected a date and time window for delivery. The day before the delivery date, I received and e-mail from CEVA with a specific time for delivery. On delivery date, they called up and said they would be two hours late (after the time indicated in the e-mail).When they arrived, they deboxed, assembled the stand on the HDTV, and placed the TV on my TV stand. I kept the boxes to facilitate return (if necessary) during the 30 day return period.My experience with CEVA was excellent. The delivery was in Southern California.The LG's picture is great (as expected). The sound is a little weak but this is to be expected on a \"thin\" LED/LCD TV and I have an audio system in place to handle the TV. As others have stated, I would buy a sound bar for a thin LED/LCD TV in any case. After spending a lot on an HDTV, why short change yourself on sound by not spending a little more on a sound system?This HDTV does not have 3D or internet apps. I do not want 3D at this point in the deployment cycle. Maybe the technology will be more standardized and developed when I replace this TV.There is an Ethernet connection for connecting to your home network. This connection is used to get firmware updates and access content (movies, photos, etc.) from other devices (usually PCs) on your home network (DLNA). I briefly tested that his connectivity worked (looked for a firmware update and played a movie). The DLNA connectivity is not important to me.I specifically did not want a Smart TV (with internet apps like Netflix, Amazon Video, etc.)included on the TV. I think the better idea is to have a separate purchased small box to connect between the internet and the TV (I use a Roku box but there are several available) with these apps. I hope to keep the TV for at least six years but expect to replace the box with newer models with more features every two or three years. I don't want to have to upgrade the TV to replace the box. Also, my previous experience has been the apps work better on a separate box than on  a TV.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R143XK8N6G292C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I was confused but be aware this is NOT a smart TV (that means no Hulu, Netflix, built in, you'll need something like a roku box for that)That being said I specifically didn't want a smart TV because I wanted the money I was paying to go into the TV and not into making deals for apps on my tv.This is my first HDTV so I'm certainly not an expert but the picture quality is beautiful.

I knew going in that I wanted a model without 3d or the smart tv options. The major brands all had a model around the same size with similar specs, amazons sale decided me on picking the 4600 up when it went below 700 dollars. Currently I have a cable box, xbox 360 and playstation 3 hooked with 3 hdmi cords so I can't speak to the other hookups.Its necessary to tweak the video setting to get the full potential out of the picture. Out of the box the cinema setting is too dark and the sports is too bright, the game option works pretty well but needs some fine tuning. The built in picture wizard is a good tool to calibrate the basic settings of the tv but it caused me to overdo the backlight setting. One issue with the tv, which I've found after researching lcd-led edge lit tv's is that its hard to avoid having a tightrope with edge bleed. If you want the bright scenes to display well and you crank the backlight up the dark scenes will have some edge bleed and vice versa if you crank the back light down the light scenes lose contrast but you'll have less edge bleed. The edge bleed is pretty subtle and is mostly in the lower right corner of the screen, I didn't even notice it until after having the tv for a couple of days.The best compromise I've found that pretty much gets rid of the edge bleeding is setting the brightness which controls your whites to around 95-100, contrast which controls black levels to around 40-45 and setting backlight to depend on the lightness of your room, lower for dark rooms and higher for brighter ones. Usually around 40 or lower for darker rooms and up to around 60 for brighter.  I really noticed the edge bleed after using the picture wizard and setting the backlight to 100. There are two built in professional calibration options that allow for further customization of color, which I haven't messed with very much.There has been a lot of comments about the speakers being bad and I'm not much of an audiophile but I haven't had an issue with them. They aren't home theater quality and I'm not coming from a surround sound theatre, the tv is in my bedroom so the sound isn't having to fill a large room but they've been sufficient so far. If your coming from a fancier audio setup up you'll probably want to upgrade the speakers. Turning on the surround setting does do a good job of giving the sound more depth.I was impressed with amazon's delivery time, I'm a prime subscriber and was happy that the tv had free 2 day shipping. I was a little nervous when I saw it was being delivered by UPS but the driver did an excellent job of being careful with the tv and there was no issue with the physical condition when I unboxed and installed it. Overall I would give the tv a 4.5 rating but will round it up to 5.Update for 4/11/13I've owned the tv for around 6 months now and am still happy with the product. I did end up buying a soundbar which did improve the sound quality a lot. I would also recommend using the video setting CNET used for their review. You can find them by googling cnet lg 4600 settings.

I've assisted other friends and family ( I'm the tech geek) over the years on purchases so I had a good baseline for what I wanted...and that was the best picture at the best price, with bonus of light weight ( bulk and weight was a prime reason I stuck with the sony CRT so long...living in an upsatirs apartment with no elevator make it loads of fun to move)......so 120HZ LED big screen for under $700 including saturday delivery....I pounced...  All in all I got a very good set, though wish I did a bit more research as I would have gone plasma. The viewing area I use is very dimly lit if lit at all so its been a bit of struggle to get black levels where I would like them....I've tweaked like crazy and can get great black levels if I dial the backlight way down to 10-20....however then my whites become grey...in short this set is best used in well lit rooms, which isnt me...That said overall its something I can live with, might make upgrading happen sooner, though hopefully I'll keep it till OLED sets reach mass market.  Gripes other than that of poor research are , with my set at least its very red on standard color temp, I have to use cool setting, warm is extremely red. The color red itself was also a problem using the built in calibration tools, the color itself I could not make vivid without screwing up the rest of the picture. The Disney WOW calibration disc helped very much with that though with the most advanced calibration tool set.  All in all its a great set at a great price, just be aware of room light, this set rocks for higher light areas, for dim to dark go plasma or go much further up the price range.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Superb HDTV", "Author": "Scott E.

I went to multiple best buys to compare samsung, lg, sony, panasonic, and sharp version of both plasma and LED tvs in person.  I quickly realized I needed LED for my situation since our family room has a lot of windows and gets a lot of sun during the day.  I will probably consider a plasma for a theater room I'm putting in my basement.  Anyways, after multiple trips to best buy it became apparent that the best led sets were samsung and lg and in my opinion lg was and is superior to samsung in terms of picture quality when it comes to LED.The amazon shipping service was a great experience as i think it paid $20 extra and scheduled an appointment when i ordered and the guy came and hand delivered it, took it out of the box, put it together on my tv stand in about 15 minutes.  The picture from the start was amazing.  I did some minor tweaking to brightness, etc. to cater to my preference, but I didn't have to change much .  I am not a gamer so I cannot speak to video game use, but i watch a lot of sports (10 hours worth of football every sunday) and movies and the picture has been great with both.  If i could, i would rate the picture 6 stars.Not everyone will think this matters since most people who have a tv this size have a theater system or at a minimum a sound bar (this is what i have), but sound does get tinny when the volume is at or above about 20 out of 100.  The only inconvenice to me is that i have to mute my tv whenever i turn it on and turn my soundbar on when I want good volume like for sports or movies.  This is the only thing that kept me from giving this tv a 5/5.Other than the sound, the picture is awesome, like i said, the tv itself is really good looking and has 3 hdmi inputs, which is good enough for most.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this tv and for those who are thinking about spending $100 less and getting a vizio, do yourself a favor and DON'T because vizios are crap.  In all seriousness, picture quality does matter when you compare a brand like vizio with LG.  in my opinion, LG has taken over samsung as the elite brand of big screen tvs.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV for the price", "Author": "Christopher Joseph", "ReviewID": "R3JW8K50SFM5ND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this to replace a 42\" Panasonic that died in only 2 years.

I did a lot of research before buying it and narrowed my search down to the LG, Samsung and Sharp. I usually always look for customer reviews because they are the truest yardstick for any product - especially objectively written 1 and 2 star reviews. One negative point that consistently emerged across different web sites was the 'tinny' sound. I often wondered what it meant. Anyway, after comparisons, I went for the LG because the price differential was significant between LG, Samsung and Sharp with the LG offering the best bang for the buck. I also reasoned that if the sound was too bad, I could go in for external speakers or a sound bar. In other words, I went into this with my eyes open. Well, here I am nearly 6 months later and here are my inputs.The picture is great - especially when watching newer digital movies or HD material. Its got 3 HDMI ports - In my initial review, I had erroneously put in 4 ports - thanks to Greg for pointing it out. Screen can be swiveled - very convenient. Overall, I am happy with the purchase based on picture quality alone and some of the available features.Sound is a different story altogether. Its not too good. The reviews were right - the speakers are \"tinny\". At slightly higher volumes, they start generating a vibrating noise and you cannot hear dialogues clearly. The sound is as if the speaker is kept on a vibrating tin object. Yuck ! For this factor alone, the market should be dumping this TV. LG really needs to get their act together and rectify the sound. What's the point in having a larger screen HD TV if the sound is a big let down ? I now am researching sound bars to ensure I get a good one for substituting the TV speakers.My recommendation would be to avoid this TV on its own unless LG rectifies the sound/speakers. If on the other hand, you already have a home theater or plan to pick up a good quality sound bar, then I would definitely recommend this TV. It would be good return on investment in that case. If the TV has an option to buy without speakers, that would be a great buy (Panasonic has that for some of its HDTVs). If however, you do not want to pick up a home theater or sound bar, I would suggest going in for a different TV - maybe a Sony or Samsung or even the Sharp 60 inch.I have given it 4 stars despite the sound because the picture quality is really good.

I have a Roku so SmartTV wasn't important to me.  When I found the 55LM4600 for $799 I went for it!  I calibrated the picture and found it still not as clear as my other LED TV so after trying to play with it for a few days I decided to look and see if it needed a firmware update.  It did, and after installing the update via USB my picture quality improved considerably.  I wish there was more 3D content to watch on it, but that's not LG's fault.I have a fair sized living room and there is probably close to 20' from the TV to my couch.  At half volume this TV is plenty loud enough to fill the room. I'm unsure why people are complaining about the sound unless something is wrong with the one they have.  The output for sound on the TV is optical only, but if you're like me and have a receiver you don't want to replace, I found a $25 optical to RCA adapter on Amazon that came with cable.  Many stores will tell you no such adapter exists snd you need to buy a soundbar or receiver - they are wrong.  There is, and it works just fine unless you are an audiophile.This is an excellent TV for what I spent, great value!  I would have given it 5 stars had I not needed to update the firmware manually.  I doubt many people have ethernet in the room their TV is in and the instructions on their website are not as detailed as they should be for USB.

I've tried custom tuning as well as the picture wizard.-There's also more blur in fast-paced scenes. Also a little disappointed that you cannot customize TruMotion settings, or even turn it on/off.-I know not much should be expected of flat panel audio, but this one is the worst of my 5 sets. You have to turn it up quite a bit to hear voices and by then, any sudden audio spikes (like an explosion) will create a huge buzz/rattle in the speakers. In fact, I'm pretty sure one of them has already blown. But I have a HTIB hooked in, so audio is not an issue for me.-This is my biggest gripe. All rear input/output connections face straight out, instead of down. This made wallmounting w/ my very low-profile mount kind of difficult so I had to buy right-angle HDMI & TOSLink adapters.

Occasionally, there have been times that I sort of hear a slight, (very brief) echo to a spoken word but when I say 'occasionally', I mean that maybe I've heard it once in two months.

The picture wizard II feature allows you to easily calibrate your screen to get the best picture possible. There are a lot of image adjustment options which allow you to really fine tune what you see on the screen. The menus are nicely designed. The quick menu is convenient. There are a few things I noticed which a person might want to know. This shouldn't be a problem for most people, but one of the two component video inputs doubles as the composite video input. So if you use the composite video input you only have one component video input. Another thing is, if you connect a laptop to the TV via HDMI, the only aspect ratios available are 16:9 and 4:3. You don't get any of the zoom ratios when the HDMI signal is coming from a computer. Other inputs, including other HDMI devices, do have all aspect ratios available. The third thing that surprised me is that the TV is not grounded (no grounding plug), which concerns me a little bit. Other than that, the TV and remote seem very well built. I was surprised to find out that the TV itself can do picture slide shows, and play videos and mp3s off of a flash drive you insert, or via a network connection to your computer.

I got it within 3days.  This is why Amazon is as great as they are.

Since the cable company I have does not provide all channels in HD it is absolutely noticeable when you are watching a standard definition program.

At 47\", with LED, and 120 hz that is a good deal.  It also arrived very well packaged, both in the Amazon box and the LG box.My one minor complaint is that it only takes one \"component\" at a time, so you can't put a bunch of older electronic compenents like VCRs into it at the same time even though you can plug a bunch of other stuff.  I tried using both an older Roku player and a PS2 that I use as my DVD player into it at the same time, but the plug set on the bottom requires the more recent three plug version to show the picture in color.

Amazing image, small bezel, low power consumption, just a bit thicker than an inch, and doesn't have all of the frills modern sets like to push at people.  Until \"3D\" becomes something more than a simple manipulation of the eyes through some silly glasses with a limited amount of quality material to view, I have no interest in paying for it.  Also \"smart televisions\" seem redundant when every other device on my system (xbox 360 and blu-ray player) have access to the applications I enjoy.  This is the perfect television for me at a reasonable price.That said, I removed two stars because of my distaste for Amazon and the shipper they used (CEVA).  Amazon has expanded with 17 new warehouses in an attempt to speed the shipping process, but at the same time added sales tax for the states it moved into.  That's all fine and dandy, but this new-and-improved shipping standard took almost two weeks to arrive.  Out of that time, based on tracking the package, the television sat in Austin (where I'm located) for an entire week at CEVA's warehouse.  They called me once to tell me they could deliver in the middle of the workday, and otherwise I'd have to pick it up from them.  I use public transit, and the whole reason I shopped Amazon (now without the benefit of being cheaper) was to have the item delivered!  It took about 3-4 angry calls to the CEVA manager here in town until they finally decided to act like delivering packages is the whole point of their business.So basically my point in a nutshell:  this is a top-flight television that you should buy in-person through a different retailer.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lg 47ls600 true review", "Author": "Craig Foxxx", "ReviewID": "R2CPBFHVPQEZH8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hello so I ordered this Tv a couple of days ago. but before buying this tv i searched all over for real reviews and videos by real people and never seemed to find one i thought was actually by a real non paid person..so far wat i read i like but i will have to find out myself..  since my lg tv 47ls4600 will be here tomorrow sat. 15.2012 i will be reviewing this product with my opinions and this is my first time buying a flat screen tv.. i just got my own apartment.. yes!! but if there is anything you guys want to know in particular let me know and i will review it.. im thinking about doing a video review", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG 55LM4600 Bad straight from store", "Author": "egdeleon", "ReviewID": "R1JX50CEB7I55L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased LG 55LM4600 unit at Walmart .
