I bought it to replace the 13 inch tube TV in my kitchen and it fills that need nicely. The picture could be brighter and the colors crisper compared to more expensive LED LCD TVs.

It functions well, is easy to setup and has a nice picture. If you're looking for ultra clear hi-def you should probably spend a little more and get something 1080p capable. This wasn't an issue for me as I'll really be using this to watch the news while I get ready for work. I took away one star because I feel it should have 2 HDMI ports instead of one but I took care of that by using the VGA slot for my computer input and the HDMI for the cable box. As a monitor you can also use the TV's speakers for computer speakers which allows you to control the volume using the remote if you are streaming movies or shows.

However when I scanned the cable channels (several times) during set up it only recognized 19 out of the 100+ channels my cable service provides.I called Seiki's hot line and was told this TV is working fine since it is receiving some channels, the problem is that it does not have a tuner that will process digital signals.  To receive those channels it would require an external QAM tuner or digital adapter box to process digital broadcasts, which, of course, I would be required to purchase.  I guess by omitting the digital tuner it allows Seiki to sell these TVs so cheap.It has been nearly 5 years since the government mandated that all TV signals had to be broadcast in digital format.  How can a manufacturer produce a TV now days that does not meet five year old FCC standards?  Unbelievable!!I called Amazon and they agreed to allow me to return the TV.
