{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV with many nice features", "Author": "8800 User", "ReviewID": "R1A31T34UWFPJH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok, I've been through 5 (yes five) TV's in the past 3 weeks since our original Sony rear projection died.  We originally purchased a Sony EX700 series TV to replace the dead TV, however due to extremely poor viewing angles we returned it. We then had two Samsungs (UN55C6300) which were both defective so I decided to go back to Sony and get this TV (KDL52NX800).  Here's my thoughts:The Good:The TV is absolutely beautiful to look at, when it's turned off. The \"monolithic\" design of the TV is very appealing and looks great.  The picture quality is also very good on this set, although you can do better than what this set offers. The screen is fronted with a pane of glass, which adds to it's appearance as well.  Internet widgets work great and a recent firmware update (automatic) made Netflix perfect. The menus are intuitive to use as well.  The TV offers a vast array of inputs (4xHDMI) along with a blue-backlit remote control to control it all. Colors are awesome on this set and far superior to two Samsungs we've had prior to this set.  The great colors are due to Sony's factory settings that are closer to THX than Samsung's.The Bad:This is my second Sony in as many weeks.  We started off with an EX700 series but with it's rediculously narrow viewing angle we returned it and then went to Samsung.  However, after two defective Samsungs we're back at Sony - this NX800 series.  While the Samsung has a much wider viewing angle we gave up on the brand after receiving two defective units.  The viewing angle on this Sony NX800 is similar to the EX700 - very narrow.  At about about ~20 degrees off center things start to wash out. Also, the picture quality is not quite as sharp as the Samsung that we had however, after some adjustments the PQ can be improved. The remote control includes a cool blue backlight, but unfortunately the buttons are black plastic so you cannot read any labels (though you can see button layout).  Lastly, the pane of glass on the front of this screen acts more like a mirror sometimes than it does glass.  We've become accustomed to closing blinds and dimming lights while watching TV to overcome the reflections.In general, we're quite happy with this set despite it's major drawback which is narrow viewing angle.  You'll see the same complaint on most LCD's today - especially larger ones - however, the Sony seems to be the worst of the bunch. We'll live with it. Out of the box required very little color alteration to get it looking good unlike the Samsung which took me hours due to their \"hot\" color scheme.  We did turn off MotionPlus to get rid of the \"soap opera effect\" that the new 120hz and 240hz TV's have so that was easy to overcome.Having spent hours researching TV's I think Sony may be a better choice than other manufacturers despite their narrow angles.  So much of this TV \"just worked\" right out of the box - including getting it working with Media Center (which was a serious PAIN with the Samsung).  These sets are discontinued (last years model, replaced with NX810) so they can be had at pretty good pricing on the web and also at your local retailer.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty outside, Major problem inside.", "Author": "R. Pae", "ReviewID": "R2E3X3SFZ1YLLM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've purchased this TV around end of March (manufactured date January 2010).  Noticed a unusual distribution of back lighting in the form of vertical lines.  Two in the lower quarter portion of the screen and one in the center top portion of the screen.  After Sony authorized repair shop guy verified the problem they proceed to replace the video panel.  Where I've discovered that \"Sharp\" video panel was in this TV model (previous Sony TVs used Sony/Samsung video panel).  Addition to replaced video panel showing the same symptom, now I have dust all over the interior of TV screen.  Because this model has glass frame covering the actual video panel, once you open the unit dust get trapped inside.  My TV went through three different video panels (which did not correct the problem but merely improved), and two failed cleaning attempts.  It just didn't make any sense why Sony is wasting their resources replacing the same parts numerous times while creating additional problems.  It seems so logical to swap the problem TV with the replacement.  Repair shop on the other hand was happy to keep working on the problem TV since they get paid each time they do the job.  By looking at the other reviews I'm not the only one with these problems.In addition to the problems I've mentioned earlier are; mysterious cracking/clicking noise, inadequate speakers, and poor finish (bad plastic molding and dented TV stand).  All which Sony deny there is any issue and unwilling to accept the cosmetic defects.  So if you have scratches and dent on the unit but it displays pictures then you are out of luck.  As a loyal patron to Sony, this one really hits me below the belt.  And because of my experience with Sony, they lost half a dozen customers (friends and family member), who were also eyeing on this model but moved on to different brand's 3D TV.UPDATE:Finally a light at the end of the tunnel.  After another cleaning attempt failed miserably Sony finally decided to do the logical thing, exchange the the whole unit.  After three months of ordeal now I have a problem-free new unit (Manufactured date April, 2010).  I hope others learned from my experience. If you are faced with similar situation where you have to open the unit up...DON'T!!!  Insist Sony on other options and talk to higher level tech support.  I change the rating from 1 star to 3 stars since the main problem got resolved but I'm still upset I have Sharp TV.Sony did not say why TV makes clicking noise but I found out  when you turn off the TV, it's not really off.  Networking and other features are still on.  If you press i/o button on the back of the remote you can hear another click even your TV screen is off.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simply amazing!", "Author": "J. Brown", "ReviewID": "R3ULU9BKJ0XMG5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE: I have started to get the popping and clicking noises as well. I have seen it mentioned several other places as well. It sounds like old monitors when they turn on. It does it for about an hour after I turn it on and about an hour after I turn it off. Very annoying.This tv is incredible! The design is very sleek and understated. It has a much more expensive feel than all of those Samsung TV's with their plastic see through bezels. Those come off as kinda cheap looking to me. And the picture is just stunning. Very rich colors and dark blacks. It does have a glass face, so in super dark scenes (where the picture is almost black) you can see some reflections if the lights are on. But otherwise I don't see any reflections at all. The only other thing I can say about the picture is that at extreme off angles, the picture does get pretty light. But I wouldn't be watching from that angle anyways as it is basically completely to the side of the TV.The other cool thing about the TV is all of the internet connectivity. It has built in wifi (no need to buy a dongle!), so it is easy to connect. It has tons of content providers: youtube, pandora, netflix, amazon rentals, slacker radio, podcasts, etc. etc.. The youtube client was actually very nice and useful. I wish I had a netflix account so I could try out that service. But it looks cool. There was also a library of Michael Jackson videos loaded onto the TV. A nice little tribute to the man.There are some widgets for things like weather, stocks, facebook, twitter, etc.. I think the only one of those that I'd really use would be the weather widget, but who knows. At least it is there.All in all, I don't think you can get a better TV right now. I am extremely satisfied and impressed.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "beware: defective plastic (creaks) on most models", "Author": "asturiaz", "ReviewID": "R1ZBMGO2KZXMNQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have bought a Sony NX800 a couple of weeks ago and I felt the need to inform potential buyers of a substantial problem in this model: you are very likely to hear creaks for around 30'-60' after turning  the TV on and after turning it off. It seems due to the very cheap plastic used by Sony for a model which is advertised as a high-end TV. Before putting a product on the market, any reliable company will test it, but not SONY.After a quick search on the Internet, I found comments of people having the same problem in addition to black cones visible on the edges of the screen (the uneven backlighting indicated in another review).", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent modern TV", "Author": "SwillSSwil", "ReviewID": "R2SXW6UQ4ATNMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently (Aug 2010) had to replace by Sony Bravia 52\" W-series due to unfortunate circumstances.  Initially, I purchased a Z-series as the replacement, but they were water damaged, so the company offered me an upgrade to the NX800 52\".This is a great TV.  There is no crackling noise as others have mentioned, and the screen has no discoloration or bad pixels.  Connections were straightforward.  Great picture.  The sound could be a little fuller, but for a serious watcher that has their own sound system, this isn't a huge problem.  The energy star compliance is icing on the cake (the more energy star devices I own, the happier I am).I love the internet connectivity that is built in.  Instead of needing to connect a computer, the TV itself can access things like YouTube, or Amazon video on demand.I hooked up an up-scaling DVD player, a PS3, and an Xbox 360 (all HDMI), and they all look great on this screen.It's probably not the BEST TV out there, but if you aren't one of those cutting edge types who want something more affordable, I think this is a good choice.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Uneven Backlighting", "Author": "Hanz Richter", "ReviewID": "R2FOZSD1Q1Z6F6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have also witnessed the uneven backlighting on this particular TV.

I researched Sony, Samsung, LG and others for several months in stores and on the web and decided the NX800 was the one.  I have not been disappointed.  The wireless on this TV is great (and easy to set up) with nice sites like Shutterfly, Youtube, etc.  Streaming video from multiple sources via the web like Netflix is good.  This TV looks much better than anything on the market.  Anything.  In fact, it looks as good when the picture is off as when the picture is on.  The picture is great and there are no squeaks, cracks, or other \"noises\".  Perhaps these noises some others have reported are the result of poor handling during shipping (if the noises are there at all).

I assumed it was related to the cable provider, cable box, signal, etc.  I called Sony and was put on eternal hold.  I made an appointment for the cable folks to come out and they informed me that the signal was great and the issue was with the television (Sony Bravia 52xbr).  Called Sony back and they agreed to send someone out to look at the TV.  The repair man told me it was the lcd board and that Sony would either repair or replace the TV.  Wrong!!!  Sony's fix was offering me a $1400.00 plus tax TV to buy.  I will never buy anything Sony makes again.  Customer service department is deplorable.  The customer service reps would not transfer my call to any supervisor who was authorized to make a decision and one even yelled at me over the phone.  If you buy Sony you will be sorry.  If you are rich and want a large paper weight, buy a Sony Bravia xbr.  It would be a great conversation piece, but is the worst TV and customer service I have ever dealt with and I shop on line regularly.  I have since researched the issue and I am not alone, Sony has burned many others with this particular LCD board.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sleek wonder of technology.", "Author": "Major Purchaser", "ReviewID": "RR8U38ERS7E7I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With our wedding anniversary coming up in January, my wife and I have a tradition of purchasing some new piece of technology to help celebrate it. This year we decided to replace our 10-year-old Sony 34\" tube-type TV with this sleek wonder of technology.I found a great deal for it on Amazon ($200 less than local retail)and had it delivered (free shipping)in just one week. It arrived in perfect condition and now sits atop the same TV stand that had previously held the chunky old Sony (which still works perfectly by the way).I had been concerned that the 52\" would look \"too big\" in that space, but we're pleasantly surprised at how well it fits in. To start with, this is a beautiful, black, sleek and shiny piece that actually decorates its place of importance in a way that the old \"tube\" couldn't even come close to achieving. Second, the picture and sound that emanates from it is truly awe-inspiring. And third, the cutting-edge technology that Sony has incorporated into its amazingly-thin chassis insures us that it will not be outmoded anytime soon.Its spot at the very top of CU's list of LCD TVs was what inspired us to choose this TV, and the deal we got on Amazon made it easy to commit to make the buy.

Nice LCD, but Sony has lost much of its quality, they are making sets as cheap as possible, yet charging more than usual for the name.  Got this from another vendor (Amazon is not selling this directly, it's through the 'flyingmoth' vendor).  Yes, creaks, pops, and occasional noises - makes it a bit harder when it's in the bedroom and you turn it off to go to sleep.

I cant find anything to complain about. Reading articles online, watching videos on [...] or anywhere else looks amazing.I like how all the text and images on the tv appear to be glossy, almost like a magazine. The built in wifi is awesome too, but I rarely use it.The setup for HDMI, wifi and channel tuning is probably the easiest of any tv I've used (and I have about 6 LCDs/Plasma's).I love how I ordered this on a Tuesday and by Thurs, I had 2 guys in my home office setting it up on my table.

The thing I like best about this TV is the color. Extremely vibrant, and bright. Animation, especially Disney Pixar films look AMAZING on this. For example, in Monster's Inc you can make out every strand of hair on Sully. Blu ray movies look so sharp you'll swear the actors are in the room with you. You can make out every wrinkle, pore and blemish on their faces. Fast action movies come out smooth, and in great detail thanks to the 240 hz. When you watch sports it feels like you are at the game.Wi-Fi - This is a really cool feature. The NX800 has built in Wi-Fi and many widgets to play with. Youtube, netfilx, and crackle (which is great with over 200 free uncut movies) just to name a few.Video games - I hooked up my Xbox 360 and my kinect to this, and from the moment I turned it on, I was amazed! The picture is so crisp and the detail is outstanding. Once you play a game on this, you'll never want to play it on anything else again. The game mode gives it a rich color and a nice bright picture.Connection - I've have found that hooking this TV up to a blu ray player using a monster cable brand, HDMI cable compatible with a 240 hz will make the picture 10x more sharper then using a weaker one or a generic one. They are expensive, but really worth it.The only thing that stops me from giving this TV 5 stars are 2 little things. First the sound. It's not very loud at all. Sometimes I would have to turn it up almost all the way to hear my baseball game. Second, sometimes the edge lighting can get a little dark around the edges, but only on very very bright scenes.I do highly recommend this TV. It's like having your own movie theatre in you home.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Would never buy again!", "Author": "Nothappywith sony", "ReviewID": "R2ICY4MC5TET0A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purhcased this TV less than a year ago.

First off, we bought a 46\" NX800, not a 52\".  We bought it to replace a 9 year old 36\" Sony XBR Tube Type behemouth, that is still in excellant working order.  As a true Sonyphile person, I have been watching TV evolvement since purchasing that 36\" XBR.  I've also watched the prices rise and fall over the years.  I thought I had it all figured out until 3D hit the market.  There goes all my research.  Well, long story short, we decided we did not want to wear special (expensive) glasses to watch TV so off I went in search of a LED-LCD 46\",240 Hz. model.  In the past few years a few new names have appeared and Samsung has taken great leaps forward.  Walking into Costco or Best Buy, I would just look at the pictures being displayed.  Time and time again, I could pick out a Sony picture as being the most natural and vivid looking, at least to my eyes.  OK, I'll draw this to a close.  When I finally decided to make the move (2 weeks ago), the model I finally decided was the one, I found out was discontinued by Sony in favor of the new XBR series, which was only in 3D.  My local Best Buy store, which did not have the NX800 in stock, went on the hunt.  It turns out we must have gotten the very last new, uncrated, KDL-46NX800 in captivity.  At least in Northern California's Best Buy locations.  The TV has been in service for a little over 1 week now (after being set up by a very nice and knowledgeable young man fromthe Geek Squad) and I have to say, this WAS the right decision.  This TV is totally unbelieveable in every aspect.  Perfect is not a word to use to describe this picture.  I'm so glad we did not go to 3D.  We also arranged to have this TVcalibrated in 1 month by the same young man from the Geek Squad who said \"if we like it now, we won't believe how much better it will be when calibrated to our room\".  I don't see how this is even possible, but I'll report on that after it happens.  I don't know why the few complaints about this TV (maybe it's just the 52\" model) downplay its performance, but I have to say we were darn lucky to get this model when we did, and we're so, so happy.

If I wanted to dish out for top of the line technology 2 weeks ago, I would have gotten the 3D technology blah blah but no, I went with this TV because of its design which is the most commendable aspect of the TV.  Its one of a kind, ultra sleek base that separates it from all of its competitors.  My point of this review? Buy this TV if you like the brand and need top of the line design.  Do not buy it if you're looking to compare it with the best technology out there on the market.  Just stand next to a Samsung TV and stand next to a Sony TV - if you don't sense/feel the difference, don't bother with Sony - but otherwise, Sony just added one more happy customer to its loyal user base.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture but built-in apps are slow", "Author": "nikbug", "ReviewID": "R1YI33O0GF36QP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this tv for nearly 2 years, so I feel that I have tested it well enough now.PROS:Amazing Picture - This set has an amazing picture that is hard to beat in this price range. For an LED tv, it can achieve fairly strong blacks while still maintaining vibrant colors.Design - The tv just looks cool. It is very sleek and sexy with its full panel glass. The buttons on the side of the tv illuminate just by brushing against them and then fade away after a few seconds.Supports ARC (audio return channel) - I'm a big nerd, so this is one of my favorite features. If you are using this tv with an audio/video receiver that also supports ARC, then you only need 1 cable to connect them together to both send and receive and audio signal to/from the tv. What this means - If you use the widgets built into the tv (netflix/pandora/etc), the tv will send the audio to your receiver and vice versa. That way the sound is always coming out of your nice speakers and subwoofer.Supports HDMI control - If you have multiple devices plugged into your tv and they support hdmi control, then you only need to have a single remote to control your devices and turn them on and off. sweet!CONS:Built-in Widgets: This tv has built-in widgets that work via internet connection (supports both ethernet cable and wifi[b/g/n]). They include things like NETFLIX, PANDORA, NPR, and a web browser. All of the widgets work, they are just slow to respond. Also, the Netflix takes  longer to buffer up to full HD than on the PS3. It is nice to be able to stream pandora to the tv when I am having a party though.That's about it for cons.
