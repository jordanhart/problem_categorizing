{"Reviews": [{"Title": "RCA 21\" TV", "Author": "M. P. Wilson", "ReviewID": "R1CZ4XZ2WAZTIM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a small, light weight unit, with a decent picture.  I needed a flat screen TV to mount from the ceiling between the Kitchen  and dining room.  Due to 8 foot ceilings, size and appearence were important.  This unit is what was necessary to fit the small area between room sections allowing watching from either room. The ceiling mount bracket I purchased allows the set to swivel to face either room.  The sound is fair, a little on the tinny side, even with internal adjustments.  The speaker unit is behind the TV, projecting the sound in the wrong direction, but in a small area, it is not a big issue. Sitting at the counter in the kitchen or at the dining room table, viewing this TV is a pleasure.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Picture Quality", "Author": "michael boone", "ReviewID": "RZM8WOMBR9G45", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It is supposed to have great resloution.
