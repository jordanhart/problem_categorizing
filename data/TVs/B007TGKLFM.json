{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT FOR GAMING", "Author": "Yongari", "ReviewID": "R157W0IFTR0EMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After months of contemplating which LED TV made by my fellow Koreans I should purchase, I came across this gem one day. \"DLP? LOL!\" I thought. Little did I know that DLP technology improved drastically over the past decade.First off, this T.V. is gorgeous. The picture, once calibrated (make sure you go google some settings because out the box the picture is mediocre). At first I was a little disappointed, but after proper configuration, the T.V. looks as good as the Samsung LED we have in our other living room.Gaming wise, I popped in a bunch of xbox 360 games, and oh boy, the picture was great. No blur whatsoever. Don't be fooled by 120hz vs 240hz that LED's advertise. You won't even be able to tell. Not in the slightest. 60 to 120 there is a noticeable difference in gaming, but 120+ you really can't tell. Game consoles that output that many frames per second anyways.Halo 4 looks particularly amazing on this TV. When the master chief's arms and guns are life-size, you feel pretty awesome.Speakers are ok. Loud, but don't seem to balance sound very well. For example, in most games, voices seem not-quite-loud-enough while everything else (bullets, etc) sound very loud. Maybe I can adjust this.If you don't want to spend like $5000 on a 82 inch LED tv, this is the best bang for your buck. From the front, not one of my friends or neighbors were able to notice that this TV was not LED. Even from a diagonal angle, the TV is cleverly designed so that you can't see the back popping out at all. Everyone thinks the TV is a thin LED~", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "92-inch is absolutely monstrous.", "Author": "royalwalter3", "ReviewID": "R1HMZC3WIOEA6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content":

It was right around the same price as it is on Amazon, just a few hundred more. They carried the TV into my house and set it up for me. Be warned: The TV is extremely heavy. It took 4 men to carry it off of their truck and into my house. It's easy to set up and the remote is really easy to figure out. Another warning: you need to sit at least ten feet away from the television so that the picture isn't blurry. It also needs to be on a stand because it doesn't have a wall mount. Another warning: it needs to lean against the wall because it's kind of tippy if it's not well supported. However, I left my dog alone with it in the bedroom for a few hours while I ran to the store. He loves to climb on things and jump up on them whenever possible. The TV was still standing just fine. If you go to the Aarons website and type in \"TV Console\", click on '72\" TV Console'. That's the one that we got with our television. I'm not sure exactly how much it costs and I can't find it on Amazon. It hangs over a little bit on each side by about 6 inches. With this stand, it's approximately six feet tall. My wife is 5' 2\" and when she stretches her arm up flatfoot, she barely reaches the top of it. Without the stand, it's about four and half feet tall. It's also pretty wide; about 8 feet. The television is a little over two feet wide, so when you're planning out the space of ten feet, make sure you take that into consideration. It is a lot of money for a television and I wouldn't recommend buying it if you need to move anytime soon. Before you choose to buy a television that large, make sure that there's plenty of room to put it.ONE MORE THING I RECENTLY FOUND OUT!!! Make sure you view the Mitsubishi website. On there, they have a list of authorized dealers. Amazon is an authorized dealer, however some of their resellers are not. On the website it states:\"DON'T BE FOOLED! While Amazon is an authorized online retailer of Mitsubishi products, many resellers who sell on the Amazon marketplace are not. When purchasing, it is important to note where the product is being \"shipped from and sold by,\" which is stated clearly in the header for each product on Amazon.com.\"Why does this matter? If you're not using an authorized dealer, there isn't a warranty with it. It's better to pay a few hundred more to have your TV under warranty. To find out if the place you're looking at buying your TV is authorized to sell it to you, type \"Mitsubishi TV\" into Google. The website will be \"mitsubishi-tv dot com\" You'll want to make sure the little hyphen is there. Click on the website. On the left hand side, navigate to \"Retail Locator\". When you click on that, you can either type in your zip code or click the gray box that says \"See Online Retailers\" on the right hand side. If you scroll down on the page that comes up for online retailers, they also show common unauthorized dealers, including ones from Amazon and eBay.UPDATE!!!Glad we bought the TV at Aarons. About a month ago, our stand broke. We called them and they came and replaced it with a new one for free. Our first one was wood, with beautiful doors, but the weight of the TV caused it to bow and the doors no longer closed.Today, 3/19/2013, the sound from our PS3 stopped working. I checked our Wii and the sound on that worked fine, but that uses AV cords. I checked the sound using a headset connected to the PS3 and that worked fine. I checked my XBox 360, and the sound on that, which is also HDMI, doesn't work either. Called someone and they'll be here on Thursday, 3/21/2013, to take a look.Update:As requested by many, instead of uploading just a picture of the television, I uploaded a video. The game on the screen is Call of Duty Black Ops 2. I don't own any of the rights to the game. I recorded the game using my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone. The colors look a lot better than they seem in the video. However, you'll want a dark room to play or watch in, because viewing can be hard otherwise.", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "WoW", "Author": "vik", "ReviewID": "R253DOSR9VFKIV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from my old Philips 37 inches basic TV. The upgrade forme is huge. The size of 73 inches is just right for my living room. The picture quality is excellent. Even in bright daylight, I did not have any problems even with tons of windows in my living room. 3D is amazing - but the tv does not come with glasses.THe sound system is effective but for a fully immersive experience, I would suggest adding a surround sound system.TV does take a bit of time to start up (7-10 sec), but not a deal breaker. Another irritating thing is it takes time to change channels (using my comcast box), if the channels are in different HD format eg. 1080 vs 780. (in the process the screen remains black).TV is smart enough to remember your devices. Once a device is plugged in (say PS3), it will automatically switch to that input. Has other features of a regular TV (sleep, child lock, video adjustments, audio adjustments etc)The TV is big in size, and as others have mentioned, seems structurally weak. But I think the TV is strong enough for its size and purpose. Mine arrived from Arizona to PA without any problem.Comes with a good remote with big buttons - No problems there.For the price being offered here for this model, I think it is a definite buy. Heck, this is cheaper than most of the regular TVs being offered in the market right now. Do factor in the cost of getting 3D glasses (another 100-150 bucks) if you want 3D.Update: Mitsubishi has decided to stop manufacturing these TVs, so these will be the last iteration of DLP tvs from Mitsubishi. They have still promised to continue customer support for the currently sold TVs.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Amazing", "Author": "Bradley", "ReviewID": "RXE7ZCNWKJBQ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first review i've ever took the time to post on Amazon. I've ordered many products on here, but this TV is so amazing that I had to put a review up. First things first, the TV is huge. I got the 73\" model and i'm glad I didn't go any higher lol. I'm blown away by the price and features of this TV. The picture looks great out-of-the-box but once its properly calibrated, you would be hard pressed to find a better looking TV at this price and size.  The 3D is fantastic and i've compared this TV to other sets, and 3D for some reason looks best on DLP. There is no cross-talk whatsoever, and it creates a truly immersive experience. I've tested some pixar movies and 360/ps3 games. The 2D picture is fantastic and I was surprised at just how many settings you can adjust to really get the picture quality to your liking. DLP seems to fit right in the middle between plasma and led. You get a bright and sharp picture, while also having no ghosting at all when your wathing/playing fast moving scenes and video games.  Games that I have tested range from Halo 4, all the way to uncharted 3. I am blown away at just how well this TV handles everything that you throw at it. The Dark Knight Rises looks fantastic on this TV, as well as many other Blu-ray titles. I'm also quite impressed with how deep the black levels are for this TV. If you have the TV in a proper home theater room with little to no ambient light, than your in for a treat.  This TV also features Apps such as Vudu, Facebook, Twitter, and much much more. There isn't as many apps here as there are in other brands, but that's not the main reason you should be buying a TV. What is here though works great, and many more apps will be available in the near-future. I can't recommend this TV enough, and if your wanting a giant TV at a good price with lots of feature, DLP is the way-to-go.  I hope this review helps everyone out and if your on the fence, don't be. This is an amazing TV that is just as good, if not better than plasma and led. My TV arrived in about 5 days and the delivery guys were excellent. They took the TV upstairs, checked and made sure it worked, and then took away the packaging and debris.  My TV was from Paul's TV, but was fulfilled by Amazon. I have had zero problems with this TV, and will definitely not hesitate when buying again in the future. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you enjoy yours, as much as I have mine so far. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope I have helped you in some way.--Brad", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "DLP IS NOT OUTDATED!!", "Author": "Klown", "ReviewID": "R1NF8J8UULGAFJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This television has everything those fancy expensive televisions have EXCEPT the slim size. Im so glad I bought this televsion for my Man Cave. ITS HUGE. The 3D is PERFECT and AWESOME. I'm glad Mitsubishi has chosen not to discontinue DLP's and even more glad that the television can still have the same TECHNOLOGY! Geez, I bet they could make a tube television have it all as well. I'm a CNET junkie, and an avid electronic person. If you wanna be hip and hang a television on your wall buy an LG LED 55inch for $1600. If you want a 73 inch that does the same dang thing and don't mind looking at it from ground level like back in'94 for $1200 then DUH. GO BIG OR GO HOME! Excellent DLP with no complaints.

I had only seen the TV at HHGregg and the picture was not great.  A friend purchased one of the Mitsubishi DLPs last year and raved about the picture, but he is in another state and I never saw the TV.  I decided to take my friend and the Paul's TV rep at their word and they did not steer me wrong.Out of the box the picture was amazing.  Much better than my 2 year-old 50\" Samsung Plasma and of course the size is much better.  The features of the TV are not great, but they are sufficient.  For inputs there are three HDMI, one component/composite, coax/ant, 3.5mm audio, L/R audio, Ethernet, and one USB.  The USB is in the back of the TV and while that is convenient for a wireless dongle, it is inconvenient for firmware upgrades or using a keyboard/mouse for VNC (I have not tested the VNC function).  Outputs are very limited and include a coaxial digital audio and 3D emitter.There are four picture modes with Brilliant, Game, Bright, and Natural.  The internet apps are limited to Vudu and Vudu apps.  I find it strange that Mitsubishi would be so limited when most internet enabled TVs include Vudu, Netflix, and Amazon streaming.  The most puzzling aspect is that the TV supports picture-in-picture in Vudu app mode and with VNC, but not for anything else.  An 82\" TV would be great for PiP football games.What I don't like about the TV1. Limited input/output, especially the lack of TOSLink for audio.2. No ability to turn off automatic HDMI input sensing3. Lack of internet apps.  Vudu is okay, but when practically every TV includes other streaming choices Mitsubishi should do the same.4. I would like to see more picture modes, but four is sufficient.5. Power on is very slow and the picture is dark for the first few minutes.  The slow on makes activity based remote control difficult.6. Can't hang it on a wall.  I need room for my Blu-Ray, AV Receiver, Satellite Box, and Media Center, so this is not a big deal.What I like about the TV1. The picture.  The picture is much better than I imagined.  It is bright, sharp and immersive.2. The size.  My wife already asked me when we can upgrade to the 92\".3. I am not a big 3D fan, but the 3D on this TV is simply amazing.4. The viewing angle.  No problems seeing the TV from the side.When my neighbors and friends come over the TV wows them with the picture quality and size.  It is truly jaw dropping and their first questions are \"where did you get it and how much did it cost\".The customer service at Paul's TV is excellent.  There was a small problem with the local delivery company and Paul's did everything in their power to make it right.  I have always been impressed with Amazon's customer service and Paul's TV is as good if not better.  From their sales staff to customer service, they are a 5-star company.  I would not hesitate to recommend them or buy from them in the future.Finding a stand for this size TV was difficult.  I wanted to use the IKEA Besta line of modular furniture, but it was not deep enough.  I purchased the Tvilum Lauren stand from Amazon Tvilum Lauren 7954261 TV Stand, Black and Woodgrain and it is a perfect fit.  You can leave the doors off the stand if you need more room for AV components.  The stand is sturdy and I left the door handles off for a smoother look.Additional recommendations:Purchase a LED light kit Ledwholesalers 16.4 Ft RGB Color Changing Kit with LED Flexible Strip, 44 Button Do It Yourself Controller + Remote and Power Supply, 2034rgb Kit to go on the back of the TV.  It makes a big difference when watching movies at night.  The kit lets you mix colors to your liking and save the colors on the remote.

First off this TV has everything you'll ever need - Bluetooth streming, internet, tons of inputs, 3D READY (you have to purchase the glasses separatly), and the picture quality is TOP NOTCH!!!! The internal 16 speakers are ok, but you'll still need to get a surround sound system or buy the Yamaha Sound Bar with subwoofer input (you will not be disappointed). Like a previous reviewer said, the TV takes some time to warm up and the TV IS NOT very sturdy so PLEASE sit on the floor or on a STABLE stand. We had ours on a TV stand and it gave way and the TV fell face first in the middle of the night. Waking up and seeing that f**** up our weekend. The TV was ruined.....the entire glass screen inside the TV was completly shattered and it only fell from a height of 1 or 2 ft. (MAYBE). So be mindful!!! I believe its safe to say that if this TV falls at all you could severly damage it so make sure you sit it in a spot away from foot traffic. BUT this isnt a deal breaker, just take care of it. We replaced our TV with another model, but it doesnt have the 16 speaker, Streaming , or Bluetooth (Base Model)....Kinda Sucks but we didnt really use those features anyway :(. One other thing I like about this TV is if it ever dies all you have to do is buy another bulb and BAMMM; brand new again. You cant say that about flat panel TV's and I have them all; if they die you might as well throw it in the trash. All in all thie TV is flawless, if you're the type of person you takes pride in your things you'll have no problem and you'll LOVE this TV just like we do.

Now our fire place is an electric so I have about 3 ft of space on top of the fire place.  The top of the fireplace is about 5' off the ground.  My couch sits about 12' away from the fire place and when sitting on the couch your head is about 1' below the top of the mantle.  The TV sits on top of this and I was worried the viewing angle would be to far off and not look good.  It actually didn't look bad.  But I cheated and leaned the TV forward buy placing a piece of wood that is 1\" think under the back of the TV.  It wasn't going to fall over but I also anchored the back of the TV to the wall just to make sure.  Picture looks amazing and no viewing issues now while sitting.  It looks great while standing and at the sides around 45 degree angle.  For the price I couldn't be happier.  I was worried about the bulbs as I have heard they are really expensive but Amazon sells them for around $54 and from what I'm reading the bulb should last over a year to possibly 2.  I'm fine with paying that ever year or so.  I replaced a 50\" plasma and it's sound was horrible.  Because of the larger base of the DLP it's sound is great for a TV.  I have had the TV for about 2 weeks.  I had read about white spots appearing on the screen after a year or so.  I bought a 4 year warranty you can purchase at the time you buy the TV.  Hopefully I wont need it but if I do I'm covered.  I'm extremely happy with the picture and compared to my 720P Plasma the picture it's very close to it, but I'd pick this TV hands down over my plasma because of the size and sound.

Just a reminder, this unit is rather deep, so be sure if you plan to place your center channel speaker (or sound bar) in front of the television upon the same surface that the TV is resting on, that your TV stand is deep enough to accommodate both.

My review is based on several factors; features, quality, ease of use, ease of setup, Mitsubishi's warranty, and the repair service.First of all, let me share my setup so people can understand my usage and experience. I have my gaming computer, ps3, xbox 360, and onkyo 7.1 surround sound system hooked up to it. I use the TV for 5 to 15 hours a day, depending on whether it is a weekday or weekend. Most of my usage is with my computer and the rest is shared equally between my xbox and ps3. I use the TV to play video games, watch hd streaming video, surf the web, edit pictures with photoshop, watch 3D bluray's, etc.Below I will highlight the pros and cons for each of the uses and systems I use the TV for to help provide you with a well rounded picture of the TV.------------------------------XBOX 360 & PS3------------------------------Pros  * Beautiful gaming experience when sitting down  * Slight loss of brightness when standing up and playing with a camera input such as a Kinect  * Regular Blurays play beautifully  * The picture fills the entire screenCons  * 3D Blurays are difficult to watch because of the low refresh rate------------------------------Computer------------------------------Pros  * HD movies and video games are absolutely beautifulCons  * This TV is unable to show the full 1080P desktop while using the entire screen. You have to choose between two formats; either you lose all of the edges of your desktop in order to use the entire screen, or you lose several inches off your TV in order to display the entire desktop. In other words, if you want the entire desktop to show up, you essentially have a 69\" TV instead of a 73\" TV. If you don't mind losing the edges of your desktop (including most of the menu bar), then you can have 73\" of screen space.  * Because it is such a large screen, text is extremely small and blurry, making it difficult to read. I have to zoom in to websites at 175% just to be able to read text. Unfortunately, not everything can zoom in, so when I use Photoshop or other applications, I have to sit uncomfortably close to the TV or squint to try to read the button/menu text.------------------------------The TV Itself------------------------------Pros  * The size!  * Absolutely no pixilation or blur with fast movement  * Very easy to set up, it auto detects whenever you plug a device into the HDMI ports  * The display and colors are fully customizable, allowing you to tweak the colors to your preferences for each device  * There is no burn in, so you can switch between a computer and ps3/xbox without issues  * Extremely bright! I have three large windows in my living room, and even on the normal brightness I can see the TV just fine  * No visible frame rate lag with video games and HD movies  * Everyone who comes to my house says it's just like going to the moviesCons  * You can see the \"pixels\" when viewing white or other bright colors  * When watching 3D the motion is not smooth, making it difficult to keep watching  * It has an obvious narrow sweet spot where everything is brighter; however the visible range is wide  * The screen is shiny, so light reflects off it  * The TV comes with a standard remote control without a keyboard------------------------------Warranty------------------------------Two months after I bought the TV, I noticed that the screen would intermittently flicker. After another two weeks, the flickering became almost constant, so I called Mitsubishi. The Mitsubishi representative was very helpful and scheduled a service appointment for me within a few days. However, when I called the service company, they said they deleted my appointment out of their system because I lived too far away. Long story short, if you live in a rural area, make sure you call Mitsubishi and request a service update daily. It took them 10 days to finally schedule the appointment, which was scheduled another 7 days away. So, 17 days after I first called, the repair technician came to fix my TV.Unfortunately, that did not fix my TV and it took 3 more months and 2 additional service calls for them to fail to fix my TV. Finally, after 4 months of frustration on my part, I read an Amazon review of someone who had the same issue. He solved the flickering issue by purchasing a high-end power conditioner (Belkin PureAV Home Theater Power Console -Black). I bought it and sure enough, the flickering is gone! Why neither Mitsubishi nor the repair company suggested this still stumps me to this day.One thing I have to make clear; even though Mitsubishi and the repair company were unable to fix the problem, Mitsubishi stood behind their product.------------------------------Summary------------------------------I am very happy with this TV, even with all of the con's I listed. I would recommend purchasing an extended warranty with this TV because of all of the issues people have with Mitsubishi TVs.

Ive owned many different sizes and styles of TV.. I bought projectors and flat screens, LCD and then this monster.I actually went in to buy the 70\" version and after seeing this and for the little amount more it was totally with it.  What got me was I bought a 47\" TV years ago and thought it was the best thing ever (720P).. then I saw commercials with these being sold and they showed that the 82\" is actually 3 47\" TV's turned vertical. I was sold...The one thing you have to tai into consideration is a base or stand. I already had one that would hold a 60: TV but the good thing is the base of this TV is not as big as the TV so my stand works perfect.  Being a DLP it's naturally not a wall hanging TV but surprisingly is not that deep either so it will fit nicely in the corner of your room.The picture is clear, the functions work great.  the only thing we have any issues is every once a while it won't turn on.  The power button flashes for like a minute and then stops .. then it will turn on.. not sure what it is but it hasn't affected my opinion on the TV.Even with it's size it's not especially heavy but will defiantly take a couple people to move it.If the 92\" wasn't so expensive when I bought this I would have considered it but the stand was to tall and wouldn't fit in my area I have this now.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Best TV I ever have!", "Author": "Pooh Bear \"Learning mom\"", "ReviewID": "R3CTAFO204ASWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this TV now for over a year from Amazon and absolutely love it. Mitsubishi makes excellent TV. My spouse and I bought last year as an add on to our family room. We have another 65\" Mitsubishi diamond purchased in 2002 costing us twice as much and its still running good, currently placed in our play room, with  no issue at all. However, once this TV is set up, everyone in our household only like to watch on this TV. The pictures are clear and crisp, since our family room is always dark anyway. The black are true black - as far as picture is concern. There is a slight glare if we open up our blind, since its so close to the TV but its not that obvious. The only issues I have with this TV are 1. Finding a TV stand at a reasonable price, which took several months before we end up getting a deal. 2. It take a minutes for it to start when we try to turn on the TV. I'm believe the delay is due to all the internet, web TV, etc info that the TV have to retrieve. We have the same delay problem with another TV that have smart devices. The 65\" Mitsubishi old dinosaurs doesn't seem to have this issue.We also bought extended warranty through Costco and it kicks in after the warranty expire from Mitsubishi, just for the piece of mind.

Get straps to ensure this TV doesn't fall over on your kids. The TV isn't wobbly or anythign but it is massive and very heavy!!! 2. These TVs are sold by WALTS and Pauls, go with WALTS!!! Not that I used Pauls but the reviews they have gotten are sketchy. I can tell you personally that WALTS was fantastic. They called to confirm the purchase within 30 minutes of it posting to Amazon and followed it daily with updates to let me know where my TV was and what to expect. They go through a very reliable freight service as well that took extremem care in ensuring the TV came to me just as it had come off the line moments before. Thank you to WALTS and thank you Amazon.

It came shipped with severe pincushion issues which were fixed (to some extent) using geometric adjustments.  Once \"fixed\" I really wanted to love this TV.  In the end however, the picture lacked focus, or put another way wasn't sharp / was somewhat blurry.  When the screen was zoomed in on someone's face and the picture wasn't moving, everything looked pretty much 1080p.  But when watching action (i.e. sports), the picture became much fuzzier and had some ghosting effects.  On paper this TV was supposed to look great, and reading user reviews, you'd think it did.  But I had to constantly defend the TV to people watching who would notice it wasn't as sharp as their LED or LCD sets with \"well it still has to be professionally calibrated\" (these people would invariably ask: \"but it's rear projection outdated technology?\").  [As a side note I actually did calibrate picture and color using Disney's WOW, but the colors never looked correct regardless of setting, custom or among the 3 built-in settings (skin would either be overly orange, or without any natural tones).  Overall, I decided to return the TV despite how awkwardly large this unit is.  Given how horribly bad the geometry was when I received this unit, and how the picture seems fuzzy, I believe it must have been banged into during shipping and the mirrors became mis-alligned.

There is ghosting around players.  This is primarily noticeable when the camera is zoomed out ... for example, when viewing the entire 3 point arc on basketball, there is a white border around all players.  When zoomed into only 1 or 2 players the white outline isn't noticeable.  Fast movement causes a very blurred image ... it looks very pixelated.  White colored objects seem to glow (no crisp lines surrounding white objects).My first thought was that the issue was the cable feed since HD movies and Halo looked great.  I do have a couple splitters and a fairly long cable run to the basement location where this set resides.  However, I tested using the ESPN app through XBOX and experienced the same issues as watching sports live.I have played with the picture settings (brightness, contrast, tint, etc.) ... but these don't seem to help.

They said it was somewhere on their loading dock and they would try to locate it.After explaining to the rep at Pauls TV (All customer service reps are very nice and they do a great job however they NEVER return your call when they say they will) I told them I would like to get a refund because this shipping error was not my problem and I was already frustrated with the entire situation. He told me I would have to pay $150 as a restocking fee and I would receive a refund once they get the TV back to their warehouse. I requested to speak to a supervisor or manager because I felt like this was totally unfair. After calling Pauls TV and Home Direct for a period of about 1 1/2 weeks they finally agreed to my request for a full refund BUT they told me that I would have to wait until the TV arrived back at their warehouse.One month later I finally got a full refund from Paul's TV / Amazon. I ended up calling Amazon because the TV and another item that I had purchased were no longer listed under my purchases for my account. They told me it was because I changed my account password, I'm sure that is pure b.s I am the kind of customer that is fair, I read reviews and I also write fair reviews for many other products 99% of them are positive. I will not be ordering with Pauls TV or Home Direct USA anytime in the future.Home Direct USA is worse than PaulsTV. They have several locations and are very difficult to reach.Home Direct USAPauls TV 1-888-728-5712Pick Up Address:450 REVOLUTIONARY DR.EAST TAUNTON, MA 02718Local Distribution Center:DIRECT EXPRESS FOR HDUSA,(317)838-5066p.s As for the product itself these TV's are cheaply made so do not let the sheer size of the tv fool you.
