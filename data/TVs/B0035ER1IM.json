{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent quality, fair priced TV.", "Author": "OZ", "ReviewID": "R12XLD3J183856", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did an extensive research for my new TV. I compared consumer reviews, professional reviews and checked couple TV's picture my self.My conclusions at the end of research:1. 3D Samsung - I don't see this technology is ready for home use. 3D picture cause headache for lots of viewers, 3D effect diminishes a lot if you are watching TV more then 4 feet away from the screen, and who wants to wear this glasses all the time? Another factor is cost. It is high for what you really get. This technology will be much more interesting once it gets mature, but not yet.2. LED technology - I looked at edge led calibrated display by Samsung and I think it's not bad, but I see hallow of light at the edge of tv which reduces perceptual contrast. Otherwise edge led looks very similar to regular LCD, such I can't justify 30% more on average price increase.3. Samsung reliability vs Sony. Lots of people believe that Samsung is more reliable, but checking forums I discovered that Samsung has number of hardware issues with their tv's and reliability is not that great. Sony used to be great couple of years ago, then reliability went down and it appears that they are trying to recover their reputation back now. At the end, number of issues between Sony and Samsung is somewhere the same with Samsung having more hardware related issues and Sony has more software bugs. Software is easier to fix with new firmware release. This is based on their older models, since you need some time, year or longer of use to evaluate long term reliability.I bought this Sony at BJ and calibrated using AVIA HD and Avia Standard definition DVD's. I use it to play PS3 and my Home Theater PC.1. Contrast - very good. In dark room I notice a little light leaking  in the upper comers of the TV. The picture itself has very deep blacks and excellent whites. So far it's one of the best results I've seen on any LCD.2. Sharpness - perfect, but watch for setting in video mode. My TV went to overscan with HTPC connected over HDMI. It was easy to fix by changing settings to pixel mapping for HDMI port.3. Brightness - it's LCD so it can be very bright. I liked Sony implementation of automatic brightness. It changes brightness based on available light in the room. The result is picture looks more natural to watch when you turn off the lights, and still bright enough picture during sunny day. Note: I calibrated the screen with low lights in the room, it's how I normally watch movies.4. Colors - not too bad from manufacture, but definitely improved after calibration. Very lifelike at the end.Conclusion:I'm completely satisfied with picture quality of this display and I feel this TV gives you more per dollar then any other.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!", "Author": "H. Brand \"MadMax\"", "ReviewID": "R2YUKZDD0KUF2I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By now, you probably done loads of research on the different LCD TV's.. Samsung, Toshiba etc. I purchased this set a few days ago and have it hanging on a sturdy wall mount. What I can say is that the image quality is vivid and you will not be disappointed in the feature set. The motionflow100 is definitely something new and takes some getting used to. You may not want to have it ON all the time. Though when watching fast films for action scenes and sports, it will definitely make a difference.The TV has a very rich set of options and features, including slide shows and the handy USB port. Which only accepts FAT32 formatted USB sticks. it also requires registration on [...] to unlock certain DivX functionality.Overall, I believe that the 46' is the BEST LCD currently on the market - in this price range. With motionflow and the USB port being the deciding factor for me. It was well worth it. Remember, no wireless, no presence sensor, no internet connectivity. That wasn't a train smash for me. The image is crisp and vivid, HD films are an amazing experience on this TV. Now I'm off to get the right sound setup. If you done the research and have the money, GO FOR IT.. I doubt you'll ever look back.ENJOY..", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "A decent television", "Author": "Whizzer shipped his pants through amazon!", "ReviewID": "R2A31EBLC9FE85", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the Sony Bravio as a replacement for my Vizio of similar quality. It broke down, and the line was canceled so that the repair people could not get replacement parts. Therefore, I got a choice of three TV's selected for \"similar\" functionality, and after careful consideration, got the Sony Bravia.Therefore, when I review this TV, I will be comparing it to the Vizio.Video: The video is good, and the 1080p, which is as HD as you can get, looks just as good as I saw on my previous television. The standard definition could have looked better, but it is very hard to rate standard definition once you have been spoiled by the appearance of HD. One of the nice things about this television is how well it handles fast scenes. Movement if very clear on this television. I never thought my Vizio was bad with moving scenes, but you definitely notice a difference in fast action scenes.Sound: Personally, I am not that concerned about sound. If I really cared that much about maximizing my sound quality, I would run out and purchase a theater system to handle that. I own one, but I don't use it because it isn't worth the extra power it takes. However, for the sony, sound needed to be set to 60/100 to get to a volume I am comfortable with. With my Vizio, I could get the same at 30/100. So the Sony has a much weaker sound. This bugs me, don't ask me why, but I like my Television to have a stronger sound, and the Sony doesn't provide, even if I would never go that high volumewise.Design: I wanted to mention the design of the Sony as well. The back of the sony consists of two component, two HDMI, and a VGA+computer sound (also an optical and outsound). The side consists of 1 composite, 2 HDMI, and a usb, which I will get into in a bit. The back ports are facing back, rather than facing down(piano style). For those of you who want a tv flush with the wall, this will be inconvenient because you will need to leave space for the cables to plug in. Personally, I prefer this style, since it is a lot easier to plug in cables than with the difficult piano style, and my television is on a stand, not a wallmount. But I can see it being difficult for wall mount people. The side ports are not really on the side, more like on the backside. They are completely obscured by the television, and are only about an inch and a directional change away from the rest of the ports, placed in a kind of tv cubby hole. All of the ports are on the left side of the television (if that is important to you). All of the controls are on the right side. I am very happy with the controls, which include everything you need to control the television, without the need for a remote like some TV's make you do.Inputs/Outputs: I already mentioned them, naturally the VGA + computer sound allow you to hook a computer up and use this as a massive monitor. I have not tested it, but I guess it works fine. The USB port is another cool function. Supposedly, you can plug flash media (usb flash drives or flash cards in USB converters) into the television, and it can read and play the media. It claims to be able to handle music, photos, and even video. My previous television lacked this ability, and I have yet to test it out. However, if it works like it claims, that would be a great feature if you have guests and want to show someone something, or you have downloaded video and want to show it on the TV without the work of converting and burning it.Personally, I dislike how they are getting rid of composite. The TV doesn't even have an s-cable. The composite is on the side rather than the back, fortunately, as I mentioned before, it is in a cubby hole of sorts and you wont see any cable sticking out of the side. Still, if you have any composite device, this forces it to the side, and you can only have one without some kind of converter box. I can't blame them too much, HDMI is the future and soon even component will be out of style. However, for those of us with aging DVD players that still work fine, we will have to consider upgrading to HDMI. Although it is funny to me that composite is fazing out, but they still give you a composite cable standard with any dvd player, blue ray disk, or game system purchase and force you to buy the HDMI or component with your own money.Menu: I like to mention the menu, because a lot of people don't. The menu gives you some options, although compared to my Vizio, the options menu seems a little limited. Either way, it should be enough for most people. If you are determined, you will have enough choices to tweak the video to your liking. I have a DVD Video Optimizer that allows me to set the TV to ideal conditions using images and tests, but the video has been nice enough out of the box that I have not felt the need to do anything with it.Overall: I enjoy the TV, although it disappointed me a little in the sound department, the menu, and the input. This is why I gave it a 4 stars. It is a good television, but when comparing it directly with my Vizio, I didn't feel it was quite as good. Still, most people wouldn't notice, or care, about those small problems, so I do recommend this television.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Absolutely No Regrets!", "Author": "D. Knight", "ReviewID": "R2YNZCV1FK041B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this TV for about 2 months now, and have watched many different formats on it including DVD's and Blu-Ray, streaming NetFlix, over-the-air HD local channels, and SD/HD cable. I fall in love with the TV every time I watch something on it. My wife can attest to the constant stream of \"wow's\" coming from my mouth while watching HD nature and travel shows. Action flicks? Awesome!As many of you have done, I researched many different brands and models prior to making this purchase, using the Internet and in-person at local brick-and-mortar shops. I've always been a Sony fan, and didn't hestitate long when I realized that I could have a 120 Hz Sony LDC TV of this size for less than $1000. This is one of the few major purchase that I've ever made where there hasn't been any sort of buyer's remorse.The feature set is light compared to some of the newer models out there. It doesn't have Internet apps built in, it's 120 Hz versus 240 Hz, and it's not an LED-LCD. As far as I'm concerned, most of those bells and whistles are unnecessary. I picked up a $160 Sony Blu-Ray player that covers the Internet streaming. I really like the convenience of Bravia Sync integration between my different enabled components. Definitely a cool feature.This review is for the picture right out of the box. I am intending to calibrate it, and can only imagine that the picture quality will be even better!One final note...as far as sound goes, I exclusively use external sound through my home theater system, so in comparison, of course the built-in speakers sound really weak. You'll have to draw your own conclusion in that department.Cheers!", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "If you want a TV with good picture quality without a lot of features this TV is for you", "Author": "The Penguin", "ReviewID": "R1KDA688R93M5O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update after two years of ownership (12/2012):I still love my tv!  Three coworkers bought this same tv based on my recommendationand they have no complaints.  The newer model in this line seems inferior to thismodel: it is only 60 Hz.  I still don't have Netflix (I'm thinking about it though)or any online services so I cannot comment on internet.  But the tv is still a greattv and I would not hesitate to purchase this same model if I had to replace the tv.I like my setup with Audioengine A5 speakers and remote outlet to power the speakerson and off from the comfort of my couch.  This is the second Sony TV I have ownedand the previous one lasted more than 15 years.  Sony makes good quality tvs.I spent a lot of time during Thanksgiving looking for a new TV and doingresearch.  Money isn't really a constraint for me, but I wanted to try to findthe sweet spot.  I didn't want 3D or internet.  I wanted a basic tv with goodquality that will last a long time.After looking at Consumer Reports, reading reviews on Amazon, CNET and severalonline forums, I narrowed my selection to the Samsung LN46C630 and the SonyKDL-46EX500.  I went to several stores to look at these tvs.  Depending on howwell the tvs were adjusted, these two tvs looked about the same.  The Samsungis less expensive, but all the reviews I read were consistent in mentioning\"panel lottery\".  No where did I read about anyone complaining about poorpicture quality with Sony.  Be aware that tvs in different sizes may usedifferent lcd panels, so be careful about reading a review for a 46\" tv andapplying it to 32\" tv.  You can find AV forums where someone has publishedwhat LCD panels are used in the various sizes.The bottom line is that Sony has good picture quality (especially flesh tonesand deep black is also good).  A number of people remarked about sub par soundquality, but I have Audioengine A5 powered speakers connected to the tv.There are plenty of connectors on this thing including 4 HDMI (I am connectingsatellite, blue ray and computer and still have a spare).I didn't know if the lcd/led was worth the extra money.  I went to the localSonystyle store where they had four 46\" EX models on display side by side:400, 500, 700, 800.  I could see the benefits of 500 (120 Hz) over 400 (60Hz), but honestly I couldn't see an advantage to the more expensive led model.The color quality on 500 was just as good if not better than the higher endmodels.  I concluded that led did not really offer discernable improvedpicture quality and I should NOT spend money on it.  The led was thinner andlighter, but 30 vs 38 lbs doesn't matter and power consumption on led isn'tthat much lower.This tv replaced a Costco special 720p Akai 27\" lcd tv which had a verticalrow of pixels missing.  I sit 8' from the tv and at first considered a 40\" tvas a replacement.  After reading the recommendations for screen size vsviewing distance I went with the 46\".  It seemed huge at first but after 3weeks of owning this tv, it sems just right!  The prices of 40, 46, 55 inchtvs in this model class scale linearly with the number pixels.I have never purchased an extended warranty, but with only a one year warranty(standard for all lcd tvs) and reading CNET, I purchased the extendedwarranty on Amazon.Finally, I was nervous about buying an expensive electronics product andhaving it shipped and handled by gorillas.  But there were no Amazoncomplaints about shipping and for 40\" or larger tvs, they contract the freightshippers.  My guess is that this tv was probably assembled in Mexico, it wasaired from DFW, put on a truck and two guys showed up in a Penske truck anddelivered the tv in the time slot that I selected when I purchased the tv.  Iam happy with my experience purchasing a tv throuh Amazon.I am not an AV nut.  I am extremely happy with the overall quality of this tvand recomend it if you are looking for a decent TV without lots of features.I expect to be using this tv for at least the next 6 years.I really like this tv!", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome LCD!", "Author": "BiggLou.5.5. \"Lou-ne-tunes\"", "ReviewID": "RF7BALMORYL67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for am LCD TV for my basement bonus room and found this to be one of the best 46\" LCD's out there.

Unlike the 32\" Samsung we have in our living room, this TV will actually auto adjust the screen to fit the signal (I get very tired of changing it manually on the other TV).  The Bravia Sync feature between the three Sony components is one of the best I have seen.

I have worked with professional video equipment for 30 years so good picture quality and overall product quality was very important. Sony has always had a very good reputation for their TVs and this one so far is no exception. The colors are very accurate, the blacks were noticeably better than several of the Samsung models. The menus are very easy to navigate and the setup was very easy and straightforward. There are enough picture and sound settings to satisfy just about anyone's viewing preferences. Some reviews have complained about the poor sound quality from the internal speakers. I found the sound to be what you would expect from small speakers, since I have a home theater system, it wasn't much of an issue. I found the picture to be very good without changing the default factory settings. The 120Hz refresh rate on this model is great for sports or other fast moving action. I was also impressed with the picture quality when playing standard DVDs connected to the TV's component video connection from my Pioneer DVD recorder. Also excellent picture quality when connected to HD digital cable so I'm not using the TV's tuner. It has more than enough inputs for most people's needs, not as many composite video inputs, but most people have less equipment that uses them anymore. My only complaint is that I find with the design of the remote, I tend to hit the wrong buttons sometimes, it could be organized slightly better.

And so then the journey began.Until recently I had my mind made up that, in order to get the fluid sports motion AND good side viewing, it was going to be plasma. But then I began to hear the plasma breakdown/high repair horror stories and I wavered. Back came the plasma sirens calling, \"Good prices! Come hither!\". I edged oh so close to the plasma rocks, but waiting inside a restaurant for chicken wings-to-go one day I realized that the glare present on the totally flat glass screen was so totally unacceptable (unless the room has no windows) that plasma was out. That LCDs had greatly improved their side viewing abilities in the last few years made this decision much easier.So LCD it was but now there were LCD, LED-LCD, 720p, 1080p, 60 Hz, 120 Hz, 240 Hz not to mention the various brands. In laymen's terms, LEDs are just thinner LCDs that cost more, like about $150-200 more for my specifications. I saw no real difference in picture quality between LCD and LED and I found 3 inches thick is not that much different from 1 3/4\" thick. Winner-LCD. 1080p is TRUE HD and everything else is lacking, period. Winner-1080p. 60 Hz is slowly fading and for good reason. 60 Hz allows a \"shadow\" to appear in fast action or sports. Some say you can't see it, and these people need to be shot. EVERYBODY sees it! So it had to be 120 Hz (or 240), but 120 usually gets the job done no matter the brand. I wasn't personally interested in 3D (add $150-200 for 3D), but that's just me.So the specs were set and it was time to go out and see the sets side by side. LCDs come in 46\" and 55\" sizes. The 55\" models were tempting (my newly bought cabinet would fit 56\") but it seemed to me the pictures of all the 46\" sets was superior enough to notice. Winner (by a nose)- 46\". Then came true decision time, brand. Looking, and looking, and looking some more, I came to the conclusion that two brands had the best combination of picture quality and fast action smoothness; Sony and LG. Both have good repair histories so basically I began a one week search for the best deal on either of these two brands. I guess their consistant quality is evidenced by the fact they rarely have huge price cuts, so no firesale prices on either. The final deciding factor? I always liked Sony TV picture quality and decided to go for it!Since I've bought it I couldn't be happier. The only glitch I've found is that favorites can't be erased unless you unplug and reprogram (how stupid!) The sound is solid, good thing since my wife hates the speakers that \"make it sound like a theater\"???? I know Sony has had some issues with their 42\" sets, but I'm totally satisfied with mine. Good luck finding one, though. Apparently a lot of people have decided this is one great TV for $800-900 and availability is limited (older model now you know).

The free delivery into my home and unpackaging service was a big plus that caused me to order it from Amazon.  The price was the same as a local store where I would have had to lug it to my house myself. I have a car, no truck, so Amazon was a better that way for me to buy it, plus I did not have to pay the sales tax!It was pretty easy to set up, we are not Techies and we managed just fine.  I have Comcast cable/DVR, a Sony  BDPS570 Blu ray (also new from Amazon) and a Wii.  Everything was easy to hook up and works fine.  We were able to easily sync the Blu ray player with the TV and only use the TV remote.  The new Blu ray replaced an ancient Sony DVD player and a prehistoric Sony VCR, they still work fine however-I am passing them on to my son.I think that the people who give this TV more harsh reviews don't use or understand the \"scene\" function on the remote.  I have found that if I am not satisfied with the picture quality, I can get try a different \"scene setting\" and get the result I want.  Occasionally the picture is a  bit pixelated, but I think it's Comcast or not a HD signal, not the TV.  We use the \"auto\" scene setting for the most part, \"sports\" has more vivid color but sometimes the dialogue is a  bit harder to understand, and we use \"music\" for, duh, listening to music.  The picture quality may go down a tad in \"music\" but the sound quality does go up a bit.I find the TVs sound to be just fine, I may end up getting a wireless speaker at some point (mostly for watching movies and wanting that \"theatre\" feel) -but I am happy with the sound.  I was a bit surprised to find the speakers located along the bottom edge of the TV frame.  We have ours set up with the TV stand that came with the TV, not wall mounted (it's on a fireplace mantle, just a couple of inches below the edge of the TV) and I would have thought the sound would get \"stuck\" there....but it sounds fine.I am sure as we have the TV longer we will make a few adjustments and enjoy it even more, it may even deserve a 5 star rating at that point.

For comparison, I purchased a Samsung 55\" plasma which provides a beautiful picture and video playback; however, none of the 3 Sony LCD picture qualities currently in the house are challenged. I just convinced my next door neighbor to buy the 40\" KDL-EX500 version from Amazon (I bought all of mine from Sony.com) after he saw the picture my 46\" unit put out. We also have a 3rd gen. KDL 32\" Bravia as well as a 40\" Google TV which is superb in every aspect EXCEPT the interface device, which is not backlit, small, difficult to navigate in the dark, etc. The picture it produces is, esp. using Blu-ray technology, nearly palpable.Back to the issue at hand, specifically, the BRAVIA KDL-46EX500 y 120Hz 46-Inch LCD, the best advice when you spend this much money on technology is to get and use a Crutchfield HDTV calibration DVD to get the proper settings for the surroundings. Most surround sound systems are overkill and people, IMHO, tend to equate 1000 watts of power as starting points for good sound. Most professional guides and websites (did I say [...]?) will provide excellent advice on sound systems and wave propagation dependent on the shape and size of the room, etc. It can make all the difference in the world whne you;re watching a creepy show and you KNOW someone is sneaking up behind you! That's why this accessible and relatively inexpensive technology is so much fun to have in the home.Figure out what size set you need, read the professional AND user reviews, wait for the sales, and buy yourself a Sony. And a 3 to 4 year warranty JUST IN CASE something happens. One more caveat: there is NO evidence that Monster cables are any better or faster than any other HDMI cables on the market no matter WHAT the sales kids tries to tell you. This is one item where you can definitely save a LOT of money if you shop around.

The Sylvania has performed flawlessly for the past 5 years without any problems but I wanted a larger screen. I had purchased a Sharp 37\" TV a couple of years ago and I was very impressed with the picture quality. I am an experienced HDTV viewer so I feel confident in writing this review.I was looking to purchase a 46\" Sharp Aquos but I couldn't find one to fit within my budget ($1,000 or less). I looked at 46\" Samsungs but I decided to purchase this Sony because of it's name, positive product reviews, and price -- and I am glad I did. This TV has crystal clear picture quality, a very good sound system, is a breeze to set up, has a decent remote control, has a nice swivel base (so that you can turn the TV 35 degrees left or right on its base) without having to turn the entire base and risk scarring your furniture if you change sitting positions in the room, and has a SVGA port built in so that you can use this TV as a huge oversized computer monitor (which my Sharp Aquos does not have).Trust me, there is a big difference between looking at a 32\" (or 37\") HDTV screen vs a 46\" HDTV screen -- especially from 15-20' away from the TV. I would highly recommend Sony Bravia to anyone looking to buy a quality HDTV at a very affordable price. It has (1) one dedicated component port, (1) one dedicated composite port, (1) one versatile component or composite port (TV automatically detects the type of signal), (4) four HDMI ports, (1) one SVGA port so that you can use the TV as a computer monitor, and (1) one USB port -- plenty of ports for whatever your needs may be. All of this for under $900 to include Amazon.com's money saving free-shipping option -- not bad at all.The only bad experience I have had so far is that the TV arrived with a very small scratch on the TV frame. I contacted Amazon.com and they were willing to send me another new TV but I liked this TV so much that I agreed on a $50 reduction in price for the pre-existing scratch mark. I can live with the scratch mark because it is very small and has nothing to do with the fantastic picture quality and sound of this TV.

They just know what they are doing. I came within inches of buying a Samsung 46\" for $750.  Thank God I decided to go to Ultimate Electronics (BTW: They have filed for bankruptcy very recently and will be liquidating their store stocks very soon, so you might get a good deal)I got this set for just $800 and they threw in a quality HDMI cable for $10 extra (don't trust the HDMI cables sold on Amazon for $12)It is easy to set-up.  The remote is unbelievably easy to use to adjust settings, etc.  The sound is great, regardless of what anybody says--they must not have found the graphic equalizer--which is in addition to being able to adjust the treble and bass.  The picture is truly magnificent.  I like bright whites, not ones that are grey- looking, like on the plasmas. The colors are bright and accurate.

Anyone can make colors pop, but nobody does this and does it with the clarity and accuracy like Sony does, in my opinion.

Still running fine, and no complaints to speak of.Likes:Good color representation. Motionflow works very well and can be dialed down to avoid the 'soap opera' effect, but still assist with fast moving scenes in movies and sporting events.Picture uniformity is pretty good. Though I do notice some very slight banding in the lower left portion of the screen. Only noticeable when the screen is black, so it's not a problem when actually viewing something.The matted screen does not totally negate ambient light sources in the room, it does however make them far less distracting.Bravia Sync makes using your Sony connected equipment a breeze. You can turn on and control your Sony TV, Sony Blu Ray player, PS3 (Slim model and newer), etc... using one remote. Well you can almost completely control it from what 1 remote (see below).Slight Disappointments:Given the Bravia Sync capabilities of this set, you'd think they would have included a Pause button along with the Play, FF, RW, etc... controls on the included remote control. They did not, and honestly it's a real pain as is it forces you to use 2 remotes. A remote for the TV, and another remote for the Blu Ray player. A single remote is all that is really required to operate that set-up and Sony should have made that happen.Off-viewing angles aren't the greatest, but are better than some CCFL sets out there. For instance, our typical viewing position has the set elevated about 3 feet above eye-level, and 10 feet away from from us. While there is no color or picture distortion at this angle, there is a significant loss in black-levels. To the point where blacks take on a greyish hue. Not terrible, and this is a fault of the technology but not the television. Nevertheless it is a little disappointing, if not unexpected.Final Thoughts:At the time I purchased this set it was, in my opinion, the best bang for your buck. It provided a level of picture quality and features that were on par with top of the line Sony sets had released only one year earlier. It did all this while coming in at half, or less, of the costs of those sets.Of course time has marched on, and at this time there is probably no good reason to pursue this set at full retail.

If you don't have odd health issues like I do, I'm not so sure why anyone would want it.  You can get an NX720, for example, for barely any more cost.It seems to me that LED sets have TOO much light output though, no matter WHAT you do.  The CCFL sets seem to be better about not lighting up your whole room.  And the colors seem more \"solid\" and saturated to me.  The overall uniformity and viewing angles seem better on this LCD.Also the black level is good for an LCD.  HOWEVER, when a totally black screen shows up light is coming through almost everywhere. It doesn't look like actual flashlighting or clouding, but just that the entire screen can't get black enough.Contrary to reviews, the reflections are terrible on this set.  I have a lamp back behind me and the light is all over the palce on the tv to the point of me having to turn off lights to even watch tv.  Yet on the panasonic st50, sony nx720, sony hx929, etc... it does NOT do this.The video gaming experience is atrocious as well.  I could barely play rock band 3 at all because it's no fun when not only the lag is there, but things don't move right on the screen so you see the notes not lining up right in that regard either.  You basically \"see\" lag of some sort even when you set the lag calibrations in game.So the pluses when compared to plasmas are NOTHING other than more light output.  Compared with leds, it seems like the overall picture is better, but at expense of light bleedthrough, no 3D, no DLNA or DNLA w/e it's called, and horrible reflections and lag.  On an LED you can get one with almost no lag and all those features not on this and for the same price absically.

I spent $2000.00 for the TV when I bought it and the best that Sony's customer service could do for me was offer me $150 off a new TV.

If you Google it, there a ton of people who have had the same problem.  Youtube has multiple videos and comments about Sony Bravia TVs and LCD problems.  Sony wouldn't fix it or replace it, but offered my parents $125 off the KDL46V3000 (the model under which I'm writing this review).

I liked the picture on the Samsung models but I heard of too mano problems with the new C series they offer so I didn't want something that wasn't going to be relaible.  I believe the A and B Series are awesome sets and even though they are older models they still sell for more than this Sony or The new C model Samsungs.  I've laways like the picture on the Aquos sets but when I saw a comparable price Aquos at the store it looked blurry and very low tone picture.  When you start up this Sony set, the Sony logo pops up and the TV make a sound, almost like a PC would, I think this is cool but some people may find this start up annoying.  The sound on this set is different and takes some getting used to, not there is anything worng with it, it's just different, but than again, that is what surround sound is for.

And while both sets have a fine picture, we learned that pairing the relatively inexpensive BDP-S570 Blu-Ray player with this gave us exactly the same key streaming capabilities built into the NX700 (online music + video apps, DLNA, etc). That was and still is very important to us.But that trick means little if the video performance is poor. Fortunately, we're still very impressed with this set's picture quality after a year of daily use. We're particularly pleased with how well standard-definition cable content and DVDs look on this TV, a common shortcoming of many HDTVs.The BRAVIA Sync option is another feature we've grown to love. We figured out how to use just our cable box remote to control our STB, this TV, a game console and the Blu-Ray player (including selecting all the internet content). That's one remote covering what would take at least two or three, and it's a great convenience.And being honest here, the factory speakers are not too bad on their own, at least for casual watching. They're definitely better than those in our very thin (LED) NX700 set.

I read a bunch of reviews.  I try to learn the basics and then I proceed to the check out line...in this case the check out button.  Oh yeah, in the case of a tv, I like to take a peek.  I decided that it was a bit of a riot to not look at the tv I was going to purchase, I mean, instead of looking at the tv, everybody is reading the specs.  Its sort of like looking for a date on match.com vs. seeing the real deal.  So, I looked to see what appaealed to me regardless of price.  Then I asked myself \"why\" does this appeal to me? The Sony's picture was very pleasing, to my eye. The other pleasing tv's were about 2-3 times the price...led skinny guys.  I was drawn to the Sony for its \"warm\" colors.  Possibly other sets could be set up to match it, but that was my personal experience.I wanted a larger tv, but again \"large\" is subjective, it used to be 21\".  I have a 32 and was replacing it so...I liked the LED tv's \"skinniness\" but I have to admit, I didn't think that it was worth the price for that feature :)  Then I read all the specs and the reliability stuff.  The Sony had more stuff than I thought i would ever use...I'm not a gamer and I'm not a big volume turner upper.I also have a Dell and a Samsung.  Both great pics.  The Dell has this problem where it turns it self off or else its hard to turn on.  The Samsung's pic is great; however, it is a more \"saturated\" bolder brighter pic that feels a tad aggressive to me.I have a blue ray and i am contemplating some surround speakers...maybe.  Sometimes all that stuff feels a tad aggressive for listening to the news...I mean every time I turn on the tv it's not \"an event\".I have to admit, I like seeing the name Sony in front of me.  I'm a boomer and Sony was always the top dog in my memory.  I didn't get an extended warranty...not sure why...I hate dealing with that stuff and getting frustrated, but maybe i will.

But my wife enjoys DVD/Blue ray running the Gambit, so we decided it time to enjoy that format on a TV that more realistic for a movie, boy, this baby is the bomb.I got a regular Sony Blue Ray for $150 too, and put the ethernet to my router, and we have Net Flix on demand too, via our Que, and also You Tube and a Style.com (fashion shows/collections), with Hulu coming soon.The set up was a few minutes, the HDMI cords are great as no guessing and tons of wires, and I plugged in my Video/Audio my Denon reciever/amp and have stereo too. The speakers on the TV are very good, why people complain about them I have no idea.I chose LCD over LED as I figure its still has a few generations to go to be better, and the cost is was too much for my needs. I enjoy nice things in life, I own a Triumph Sprint ST motorcycle, and a BMW twin turbo 335i coupe six speed, and love designer clothes from Italy. This TV is a great value purchase.

Unpacking the Sony out of the box i was siked up because it was a good price and it was a Sony. I knew that i liked Samsung better but couldnt find any good deals in my area so i went ahead with this thinking it would be on par. Boy was i mistaken, i turned it on, ran the set up, right out of the box the picture was just so smokey and fuzzy i started having to make adjustments right away. I used the PS3 screen and Lord Of The Rings on blu ray to fool around with the color etc, and a few HD trailers i had. The ps3 screen looked pretty good but had some jagged edges around the icons, so i popped in LOTR and went to the first scene in the shire to mess with colors. It looked \"ok\" and by that i mean JUST \"ok\" the greens were a little TO green and going back and forth just made it worse with contrast and color. Also the image was still cloudy and grainy. So i tried something computer animated, and downloaded the new Shrek trailer, it had such a bad orange tint to it, and Shrek was a pale skinned color it was just awful. So after many hour i said to myself either this is really a bad product from Sony, or i just got a lemon, which is true? Probably its just bad, i've read several reviews on this model with cloudy and grainy picture issues. So to no surprise i took it back got the newer model 46 inch Samsung that retailed for 1899, for just 1199. Took the Samusung home popped it out of the box and wulla! Very few adjustments and looked spectacular straight out of the package. I'm still a fan of Sony products but just not the Bravias, they have gotten pretty poor reviews as of late, check out Cnet and you'll see that most barely get 3 stars and few get 3 1/2. So go with Samsung it is and probably will always remain the best LCD television on the market, the only complaint i have about the Samsung is putting the stand on it, which is a pain with all there TV's and Monitors. I'll stick with PS3, and my nice Sony MP3 player and stereo, but no more LCDs from them for me. Sorry folks not sure if your blind or just wanted to give all 5 star reviews, but this thing just stinks.BTW-CHECK OUT THIS MODEL ON CNET, OR ONE SIMILAR AND SEE THAT THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS 3 STARS, AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALWAYS ABOUT THE PICTURE QUALITY NOT WOWING PEOPLE.1.Sony's midrange edge-lit LED-based LCD is nothing special from an image quality standpoint(thats from the new LED models)2.The bottom line: Despite a picture that won't wow sticklers3.The commendable picture quality of Sony's entry-level (its always about the picture), isn't that most important in your LCD, umm yes.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice-looking TV, But I don't trust the company anymore", "Author": "L.
