While it is missing some features and has fairly limited menu options the excellent picture quality and built in apps make this well worth the low price.After living with the TV for less than a week my main complaints are:  - can't rename channels  - no channel favorites  - firmware updates seemed to wipe out most of the customization I'd done to the apps and widget dock  - cheap remote without lighted buttonsPros  - great picture  - decent sound (I had assumed I'd immediately need a sound bar but have decided I can wait for now)  - built in Netflix, Amazon, etc.  - attractive design with very thin bezel around the screen  - large screen size for a low price", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressive image for the price", "Author": "LFP", "ReviewID": "R34C2AFFY3VXO1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a 50\" LG Plasma for 4 years until the switch unexpectedly broke. Given the age of the set and that it went through multiple moves where the packers didn't treat anything gently, it seemed best to find a replacement. The room that the plasma was in has a lot of windows and a huge skylight,which meant that the Plasma was almost unwatchable when the sun was out - the reflections off the glass were severe. I suppose I could have invested in blackout blinds, or bricked in all the windows but I'm not a fan of the dungeon aesthetic.So, I figured a LED LCD screen would be good to try.Pros:1./ Price - $650 delivered (Prime) is pretty decent.2./ Reflections - this screen is very visible even in bright light, which is great if you don't live in a dungeon or bonus dungeon.3./ Smart TV - has the basic apps to watch Prime, Netflix, etc.4./ Good looking - it has a narrow bezel which enhances the viewing experience. I am not sure what that's all about but people who come round say it.5./ Brand - I know its a 'budget' brand but I've yet to meet someone say they regretted buying one of these things. :6./ Image quality - surprisingly good. OK its not a plasma but if you calibrate it you get surprisingly good black levels. I don't play games so I'm not sure if it blurs when you're doing the wild thing with your boyfriends on Call of Duty 15 (no disrespect intended).7./ Good sound for a panel- checked it briefly before plugging in the 5.1 system.Cons1./ In a dark room it is not as vibrant as a plasma. Then again, the super high end LCDs aren't either, despite the hype - and this is not super high end at all.2./ It's apparently eco-friendly which means it's probably related to Al Gore and the Sierra Clubi some nefarious way.3./ Thing weighs as much as a plasma - seriously.What's up with that?4./ It's a bit thick but then so are all LCDs. Not Beyonce thick but there it is.5./ Takes about 15 seconds to 'boot up'. Doesn't bother me but if you're a tier-one, high-speed low-drag, spec ops couch commando this is going to compromise your tv watching mission.Here are some settings I stole earlier.

TV's picture is AWESOME!  My cable connection is just basic standard def, but still looks good.  (I tried some over the air HD signals for a little while and it was an awesome picture.)  I've streamed Netflix in HD and it looks very good.  I still had to use my Comcast digital converter box (not real happy about that, but it's ok).The one BIG issue you MAY run into is with the wireless connection to your router.  I could not get the TV to connect wirelessly to my router at first.  I have a basic Netgear wireless G router (WGR-614).  Googled the issue and saw numerous reports from others about incompatibility between Netgear routers and Vizio TV's.  Tried some of the solutions to no avail.  Finally what I figured out is that the TV would not connect using WPA2-PSK (AES).  I had to set my router to use both WPA-PSK (TKIP) and WPA2-PSK (AES) and the TV finally connected using the WPA-PSK (TKIP) security!  The tip off that it was going to work was when I was in the on-screen keyboard screen entering the wireless passphrase it showed \"WPA-PSK\" above the passphrase entry box.  Making this security change on my router is somewhat of a security risk, but in the rural area I live in I didn't mind.  You should be aware of the possible security risk where you are if you run into the same problem.Once I connected I tested out the Netflix app.  It connected to my account and streamed my first test movie just fine (showed flipping between medium HD & high HD quality) with just some slight buffering as it got started.  I haven't played much with other apps yet to report on them.The remote does have tiny buttons, but it's not too awful for me.  We have another Vizio TV and we are used to the Vizio menus.All in all I think this was a good purchase.  I knocked down a star due to the frustration of getting a wireless connection and the necessary downgrade in my router's security.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "GoBeavs", "ReviewID": "R17DGVZXPAZUH7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Why I am reviewing: Lack of reviews on this set currently with several of them giving a poor rating. Some of the issues other reviewers were having sounded like they might be user error. Either way, I feel this is a trusted brand at the right price so and the size that I needed so I went ahead and bought it regardless of the reviews.Background: My other tvs are Pioneer Kuro models I bought several years back (and have never regretted - they are simply the best), but I needed a smaller tv for our exercise room. Based on the location of our equipment, 32\" was a little small so I needed something in the 37 to 40\" range and this one fit the bill nicely.Setup: The directions for putting on the stand did not work well for me. The quick start guide had me lay the tv flat on the floor and then try to mount the stand. The problem with this is with the tv flat on the floor, unless you live in a split level and hang the bottom of the tv over the stair it is nearly impossible to hold up the tv while trying to attact the stand. I disassembled the stand and went in a different order, attaching the back of the stand to the tv first. Then I could use the stand to hold onto, lifting up the set and attaching the base. This seems like a much better process and I don't know why the directions don't follow this route.Looks: This TV looks great. The thin bezel is excellent, giving the appearance of almost all screen. Really looks great. The speakers are thin along the bottom of the set and hardly noticeable. Overall I really like the appearance of this set.Remote:Not fancy or expensive, but nice. Buttons have a tactile feel, with a real click for button presses. I like this approach. It also feels good in the hand.Startup: I had no issues here. Menus were responsive and intuitive (no delays like some other review said). It found my home network just fine and the onscreen keyboard to enter network password was very quick and responsive. Easy step by step process to register the tv and apps. Picture came on at the end of this and looked great. I was in a room where the light was changing slightly from outside and I could see the tv adjust by the second. I don't care for this feature so I turned it off as other reviewers have done.This feature was easy to find in the picture adjustment settings and while there I could see the set has a good amount of adjustments available. I generally don't like to mess with these too much so I chose one of the presets, \"basketball.\" I chose this because basketball is my favorite sport. I like the way they dribble up and down the court. But I digress.I tuned to ESPN (DirecTv) and was very happy with the picture. Colors were bright and the screen really looked good. Viewing angles are amazing and have come a long way over the years. I remember earlier sets where off angle viewing was challenge, with the picture looking very dim the farther off angle you got. No such problem with this set. You can view from as far off angle as you can get until you are looking at the side of the tv, with no noticeable change in brightness. Reaction times are very good and the set handles motion very well.The TV was set up in a room with one window on the right side of the room. Viewing from the left and straight on I could not notice and reflectivity but moving over to the right side I could notice the reflections from the window. It was fairly bright outside so unless you are viewing off angle opposite a window during daytime hours this shouldn't be too much of a problem.I was very satisfied with the sound as well. I left the SRS setting turned on and the sound was crisp and clear with good volume. I'm sure I won't have any issues hearing over our exercise equipment in this room.Now it was time to try the internet features. One feature I really looked forward to on this TV was the ability to watch Amazon Prime videos. If you don't have Amazon Prime - what are doing? You are doing it wrong. The best $79.99 you will ever spend. Anyway, I pressed the dedicated Amazon button on the remote and got no response. I tried the Netflix and M-Go buttons located in the top row as well and they worked find. So checking the quick start guide, I was directed to the V.I.A. button to get started with Vizio internet apps. I was then directed to select \"connected tv store\" to search for apps that were not yet installed. Since I did not see Amazon prime anywhere in the menu, I was hopeful I could find it here. Upon selecting, I was advised that there was an update to this app and to select \"OK\" to download and update this app before I would be able to use it. This took only a minute or two and upon finishing I found that Amazon Prime was now one of the available apps. I went through the sign up process so the tv would recognize my Prime account and allow me access to content. This brought up an on screen code and I was directed to my computer to enter this on the amazon site. Once completed the tv recognized that I had registered it with amazon and allowed access to the thousands of shows and movies available to me as a Prime subscriber.Once this was completed I exited out of Prime and attempted to use the dedicated Amazon button on the remote once again and this time, success!I loaded up Prime and selected in Instant Videos to see the selection of HD movies available to me for free. To my surprise, Evil Dead 2 was one of the choices. I selected this movie and after about one minute it was ready for viewing. Playback was flawless, the picture looked great and I was pleasantly surprised with the SRS audio as well.Overall I am extremely happy with my choice. I don't understand the issues other reviewers have had; maybe these were earlier production units and these glitches have been resolved on later units. I don't think there is a better set out there for $479. Outstanding value and I highly recommend if you are in the market for a 40\" tv.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than expected", "Author": "Douglas G.

I mounted it on the wall using a small $25 TV mount.  It requires only two screws to hang it so you only have to find one stud in the wall.  The built in WiFi and on demand Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc is a game changer.  The remote (batteries are included) has one touch features for each of the most popular web channels. I ditched my cable about a year ago and do not miss it.  Virtually anything I was paying a cable bill to watch can be found online either for free or for a modest fee. The 1080p picture clarity is crystal sharp and the sound is surprisingly rich.  For only $200 this was an excellent purchase.  Be cautious if you are looking for the WiFi model,  it is only in the 24\" model, not the 22\".  Reading some of these reviews has revealed that some people made that mistake.

The Samsung's panel died on me about 2 weeks ago after working great since I bought it in May 2011. Luckily, I had purchased a 3 year warranty through Squaretrade and they got my refund to me super quick (highly recommended). I came across this VIZIO and it basically owns the best reviews for a 50 inch LED (now I see why), so after a little research I went for it and I really feel like I hit a home run with this one.Picture Quality:Having previously owned the 43 inch Samsung Plasma, I can definitely say the blacks are nicer on the Samsung, but that's  be supposed to be a strength for a plasma TV. Being an LED, this VIZIO has more than adequate blacks in its display of HD and even standard channels. The overall display of standard channels on this VIZIO have a decent looking picture. HD movies are true 1080p and beautiful.Sound Quality:I think the sound quality of this TV is adequate, not awesome, but adequate. If you're wanting an impressive home theater experience from an audio standpoint then I think a sound bar or a surround sound system would be the way to go here.Functionality:The TV, out of the box takes about 15 minutes to set up if you're taking your time. The remote is a little small, but unless you have massive hands it shouldn't be an issue. When you go to turn on the TV it takes about 15 seconds from when you press the power button to when you see the screen display the picture. Maybe that's too long for some people, it doesn't bother me. The Wifi connection process is fast, smooth, and seamless. As far as the Smart TV features go, it's very non-invasive. Pops up at the press of the big \"V\" button midway up the remote and it displays the scrollable bar along the bottom of the screen with everything from Netflix & Hulu Plus to YouTube, Twitter, Skype, and Facebook.I know this review has nothing to do with a Squaretrade warranty, but I felt compelled to reiterate that their warranties are so valuable. I bought a 4 year warranty for this TV that cost $99.99, but I found a 35% off coupon code that made the warranty only $70 after tax. Just thought I'd throw that out there.Overall, I would say if you're looking to go bigger than the 40 inch range with a HDTV that really delivers in quality and performance without breaking the bank, then this is the TV for you!", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT IN EVERY WAY !!", "Author": "Monu", "ReviewID": "R3OG44E0J7NUSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In general - if you want quality - you usually don't get it cheap. But with VIZIO - specially with this specific model - it's great in every way, and still priced REALLY LOW - specially considering all the features included!I have always bought higher end TVs - by Samsung & Sony. They do deliver quality - but their prices are also on the much higher side. I needed to buy another TV - for my basement den/office. I did not want to spend much - as my primary TVs were in the living room & bedroom - both LEDs - one by Sony, one by Samsung. After checking out a lot of reviews - and even going to Wallmart / Bestbuy etc to actually watch this VIZIO playing side by side with other TVs, I decided to go for this TV.Well, to keep it short, this TV has EVERYTHING :- Superb Picture Quality.- Really pure Whites : Almost none of the low/medium price TVs are able to deliver proper whites. But this one produces really accurate whites.- Really deep blacks. OK - perhaps not AS deep as those high end LEDs with local dimming, but no casual viewer can tell the difference. I actually do look very carefully - but even I will not be able to casually notice the difference. Infact, when blacks are REALLY deep - there is a problem too - details in the dark areas of the picture are rendered completely black too - destroying picture details ....so I actually prefer a level of darkness not intensely black.- SMART TV Options : It has them all ! ....Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Prime, etc etc. The SMART OPTIONs INTERFACE is slightly slow to maneuver, but once the videos are started - they play flawlessly. Connecting to my wireless network was easy.- REMOTE : Well, if you are going to be extensively using the smart feature - for using with Youtube / Netflix etc - you may want to buy a remote which comes with a QWERTY keyboard on the reverse side. These are available really cheap - on Amazon or eBay. I bought a used one for just over $10 - and it works perfectly. The remote included has everything - but lacks the QWERTY keyboard.- SOUND : Sound is good - loud & clear - vocals are clearly heard. However, if you are seriously into great sound quality - you may want to buy & connect an additional sound-bar, or an external sound system.I set the picture to VIVID - with GAME MODE enabled. That got me the best picture quality as per my taste. You will have to play around with the settings for a while to get the right picture quality. Out-of-the-box settings are not optimum.120Hz is claimed - though it is not a true 120hz. I have SAMSUNG'S high end 120hz TV - and though there is a little difference in very fast motion - but you have to actually look for it to notice it.Overall - for approx $400 (including shipping!) - this is a SUPERB DEAL & a SUPERB TV !

We don't currently have cable so we purchased it mostly for its internet apps. They work very well. The biggest downfall using the apps is the TV remote. Since it is not a full QWERTY keyboard, typing in what you would like to watch can be annoying. We use the YouTube app a lot but searching can be a pain without the full keyboard. Luckily, we downloaded the YouTube remote controller app and are able to set up playlists from our phone once we have the YouTube app up and running on our TV. Great solution! We also use the Netflix app and have had some problems with it. Every once in a while the show we are watching freezes up and then after a few seconds our TV turns itself off. We think it is just the NetFlix app itself because we haven't encountered this problem when watching it through our Wii or Xbox. Other than those few problems the apps work fast and well. I will be looking into getting Amazon Prime soon so I am able to access their streaming videos as well. We have also tried using a USB drive to load movies and shows onto our screen as well. Tips for anyone doing this, the video files that this TV can read are avi. and mp4. You need to have the TV turned off when plugging in your USB drive in order for the TV to recognize the device, as well as turning it off before removing it. Plays videos well; we ended up purchasing a USB drive specifically for watching videos and movies on the TV. This TV does not recognize large external hard drives. We tried using our 1.5 TB hard drive but it was not registering on our TV.The picture quality is great, no complaints at all. I particularly love how thin the frame of the TV is around the screen; it gives you the most screen space possible. It is a bit bulkier in the back, not super thin as some TV's but it doesn't make a difference to me since no one is going to be looking at it from behind. All the hook ups are on the back and can be easily concealed. Power button, volume buttons and all other TV control buttons can be found on the left side of the TV. It took no time to install and set up our TV and it looks great! This TV really packs a punch with all it has to offer for it's price. We've had our TV now for 2 months with little to no complaints and love it. Many other smart TVs go for hundreds more and this one has it all for a much smaller price.

Gaydos \"Tom G.\"", "ReviewID": "RN0WPMXOPG690", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an incredibly well designed 24-inch Smart TV with a stunning picture, slim profile, plenty of useful apps, and a low price. The only thing holding it back from being a perfect 5-star TV is the lack of a QWERTY remote to make proper use of the apps and having only 1 HDMI connection.DESIGNAll black with a very slim bezel and less than 2\" total depth. This thing is pretty sexy, especially for a \"budget\" TV. The stand will make some happy, other no so much. It's basically a fixed picture frame style where the TV itself sits directly on whatever surface you have it on. This gives it more of an all-in-one PC appearance than that of a TV. It sits at a fixed angle that I didn't care for at first, but it's actually the perfect angle for sitting on a kitchen counter, which is where I have it. At any rate, I like the design as does my fiancee. It looks much more high-end than its price would indicate. At less than 8 lbs and with a VESA 100 mounting pattern, you could easily and inexpensively mount this pretty much anywhere.SET UPSetting up the TV itself took about 5 minutes. Unboxed it, plugged it into the wall and cable box, turned it on and set up the WiFi. Everything worked perfectly. The picture calibration out of the box on \"normal\" was one of the most accurate default picture representations I've ever seen. I've been seeing this comment a lot with Vizio's new E-series line. This is rare, as I usually spend between 15 and 30 minutes tweaking the picture settings. About 2 minutes with this one and I was happy. Logging into the apps was more challenging than it should have been because Vizio inexplicably doesn't include their nifty little QWERTY remote with this set. More on that in the Apps section below. All-in-all...pretty easy to set up. The lack of a 2nd HDMI port bothers me a bit. It's 2013 and everything connects via HDMI. Add a 2nd port, Vizio.PICTUREThe picture on this TV is stunning with vibrant colors and deeper blacks than I expected from an edge lit LED setup. The slim bezel really helps the picture pop and, as I noted above, the default picture settings are very accurate. There are several picture mode presets, including an eye-popping \"vibrant\" setting for those preferring boosted color saturation. I've never seen a TV of this size at any price point with a better picture.SOUNDThis set has stereo 2W front-firing speakers built-in which can be set to mono, stereo, or a simulated surround setting. If you're going to be gaming or watching movies on this set, you'll want a sound bar or a decent 2.1/3.1 setup, for everyone else these built-in speakers will suffice. When set on the simulated surround mode the sound stage is surprisingly wide to the point where it will occasionally bounce a sound so that is seems to be coming from behind you. It's nothing earth-shattering and there is no real bass, as expected, but as far as built-in TV speakers, they do a pretty good job. For my kitchen use of this TV, they're perfectly serviceable.APPSI have been waiting for this TV specifically because it's a 24\" 1080p LED Smart TV. It is currently the only 24\" Smart TV on the market. The apps available are most of the ones you would hope for; Netflix, Amazon video, Vudu, Hulu Plus, Rhapsody, Pandora, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Notably missing is HBO Go and MLB.tv, neither of which are currently available on any Vizio TV. The apps that are available respond quickly, and most can run while the current program is playing (you can tweet while watching the game, for example). With all of these great apps, I was absolutely floored that Vizio chose not to include it's QWERTY remote with this TV. It's a puzzlingly stupid decision as the lack of this QWERTY remote makes using the apps unnecessarily difficult. Once you're logged in to all of your apps, basic searching is OK, as the included remote is functional and responsive, but the lack of the QWERTY keyboard on the back makes using Facebook and Twitter highly unlikely, which is a shame because otherwise they are solid apps.CONCLUSIONThe picture quality, high-end design touches, and quality apps more than make up for the lack of QWERTY remote and single HDMI port. If you're looking or a Smart TV for a kitchen, bedroom, or dorm room, this set is a stunner that's easy on the wallet. This is my 4th Vizio TV dating back 6 years and all of them function perfectly and without a single issue, so this is a trustworthy brand. If you're on the fence, go get it.

I placed it near my LG LM7600 47\" model (which I have been extremely happy with) for a side-by-side comparison.  After some tweaking of the Picture settings, the results were very satisfactory.  I realize that comparing the two models maybe like comparing apples and oranges, since there was a big price difference between them.  But for the price of the Vizio I think that its picture quality and sound are very good.I also set-up the Network connection (via WiFi) and experienced no initial problems.....at least with the internet connection.  I signed on to Amazon and scrolled through its offerings with no problems.........but I didn't attempt to load any movies.  Honestly I didn't buy this model for its Smart TV functions since I am taking it to a mountain cabin where there is no internet access.It does take several seconds to power up (much longer than the LG), but that's no problem for me.  I think that it maybe connecting to the internet prior to bringing up the screen view.  It will be interesting to see if it activates faster at the cabin with no network to connect with.The settings menu is basic, not nearly as detailed as the LG.  For example, I did not see a way to update the firmware via online connection, so not sure if that is an option. Also the only input connection I tried was the coaxial cable for TV viewing.  Once I set it up at the cabin I will connect to a blu-ray player via \"HDMI\", and the receiver via the \"component\" & \"optical audio\" outputs and check their status.  At its price point I think that it is a good deal and will initially conclude with a tentative endorsement....to be followed by a later update.Day 20 Update:So far, no problems experienced.  Granted I only use the unit for (1) watching BRs, DVDs, and as a PC monitor at a mountain cabin with no OTA or Cable TV reception.  I used Disney's WOW calibration disc but the changes were minimal using the \"Custom\" picture setting.  I lowered the Sharp level slightly from the default setting.  The other default settings were already close to the WOW calibrated results.I have noticed that the Picture is noticeably better watching Blu-rays than DVDs, but that could be attributed to the Blu-ray player (Panasonic BMP-BDT310).  The built-in speakers are adequate, but I am using a 5.1 audio theater speaker setup, with great sound.As stated above, It still takes several seconds to power up (over 20 seconds).  Another possible reason may be because it is Direct-Lit LED (an economical type of Full-Array LED that uses fewer LED lites behind the screen).  That is definitely the reason the unit is thicker than an edge-lit model.  No light bleeding or clouding noticed and it seems that the picture quality has continued to improve over the past 20 days.For the price I think that it is as good a set as could be expected and so I continue to rate it 5 stars.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV for Quality and Price", "Author": "V.

So this review covers initial impressions, ease of setup, etc.OK, I use this for a bedroom TV, using OTA (over the air) tv signal.  I also have the VIA (Vizio Internet Apps) functioning via WIFI.Packaging - box weighs about 15 lb, so this is light weight.  This can be good or bad, we will see.  Being light weight helps ensure safe shipping, so that is good.  Arrived from Amazon, via UPS, in good shape.Open to watching TV was probably 45 minutes - this included changing antennas (requiring 2 scans).  I pulled off foam blocks, removed from plastic bag, located the base and attaching screw.  The base is held on with a single screw, Allen wrench included.  Easy peasy.  Set on stand, attach power cord, put batteries in remote, connect antenna.On power up, asks for either home use, or store demo, what type of signal (cable or antenna), and then scans for channels.  The bedroom is on the second floor, and the antenna is a Mohu Leaf - so I was able to pull in plenty of stations, with very good signal quality.Next I setup Netflix, and Amazon Prime - this probably takes 15 minutes for both.  Typing in the passwords with the remote is tedious, but that is the same with all remotes, and long passwords.Initial impression of picture/sound quality - this is a 720p TV, so that considered, very good.  sound is fine, and allows external speakers.Price is very good, and overall value is high.  Vizio makes a great consumer level product, and this is no exception.I generally only give 5 stars to truly outstanding products, so you may find my 4 star rating a bit low.

The frame is very thin around the screen, as you can see in photos, so it looks pretty nice.  It is not the thinnest TV ever, but it is still pretty thin and the connections on the back are vertically positioned, so you can place it back against a wall easily.-Built-in web apps:  There are quite a few to choose from, though for me the most important are Netflix, Amazon Video, Youtube, and Pandora.  There are a host of other random things that I have little use for.  The functionality is pretty much the same as I have seen on Roku, and it is nice to have all of that built into one device and on one controller.-Sound:  The speakers are surprisingly loud for such a small TV.  They are relatively clear as well.  Don't mistake this to mean that there's exceptional bass or highs or that it simulates surround well, or anything magical, it simply produces loud and clear stereo that is more than sufficient for a large bedroom, which is all I needed.-Picture:  Clear and bright, although there are a few jagged edges at times and the color depth does not quite compare to my Sumsung 50A550 50\" Plasma.  Then again, not much does.  Perhaps with some tweaking I can make it a bit better.  Overall, unless you're pretty picky and have a high-end TV to compare to, I don't think you will be disappointed.  It is sharp and overall looks good.-Tuner:  Seems to pick up most of the channels in my area (over the air) but does not pick up as well as my Samsung.  They both use the same rooftop antenna and the same signal booster and actually the Samsung's cable run is longer and goes through more devices but it does a better job of picking up weak channels.  However, only the very weakest channels (40 miles away) are dropped, so I'm relatively pleased.Now for the reason that it gets a 4 and not a 5:-Wireless connectivity:  This TV has built-in wireless.  If you look at the instructions that come along with the TV though, you are basically informed that it is preferred to use a wired connection.  I had no problem going through and setting up the TV to connect wirelessly to my router, and it seemed to connect just fine.  I pulled up Netflix and browsed through and everything was fine.  But I discovered that after 10-20 minutes of watching anything on Netflix or Youtube, the connection would drop and the built-in wireless would crash.  It would not come back until I turned the TV off and back on again, sometimes not even coming back until I had unplugged and replugged the power cable.  Pretty annoying.  Not sure if its a problem with firmware or hardware.  Certainly not a problem on my end.  I run an Asus RT-N66U router and a Cisco DPC3010 modem, neither of which gives me any trouble (as they shouldn't, they are both pretty expensive devices) and all of my other devices (PS3, two laptops, two phones, and a wireless printer) are all maintaining perfect connections.  So I ended up having to use a spare router as a wireless bridge and hook the TV to it with a cable, and now everything works great, but it was a pain to set up.My overall impression is that this is a good TV.  For the price, you simply cannot beat the features, but if all of the features do not work, are you getting the best deal?  For me it was fixable with what I had at home, but if this is a problem with all of these units, you may not have all of the features you are promised.  I can only hope this is an isolated issue.  If it isn't a risk you are willing to take, you may consider getting a similar, less expensive Vizio TV with none of the internet apps and internet connectivity features and just spend 50 bucks on a low-end Roku.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 2nd TV with outstanding SMART TV features", "Author": "W Scott Troutman", "ReviewID": "R2SQ0H66H90XOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this as Christmas gift for the kids play room.

Sound is okay for a small room but would probably struggle in a larger room, although it does have digital optical audio and RCA out to run through a soundbar or A/V receiver.  Have a Wii (component) and Xbox 360 (HDMI) connected to the TV, and that still leaves one HDMI available. The thin design is great and it is a nice looking set.

The design is simple and stylish, the bevel makes it great for wall mounting.

For the settings, 1080P and 120Hz, its worth it.My only issues with this item was the remote and the streaming/load times for the Smart HDTV features. Out of the box there is an initial setup that requires your name, wireless router connection, password input. The remote was not designed for this at all. There's a pop up keyboard that you have to use the remote to navigate, not fun.As for the Smart HDTV features a little on the slow side. Not streaming wise, but loading wise. Example: You click on HuluPlus/Netflix, it asks you if you'd like to start the application, and then it takes 30-45 seconds to load, once in the actual application responses are slow, the icons for various shows take time to load up, moving to another category takes time. Don't even attempt to use a \"Search\" option with the stock remote (lol). Once you find the movie you want it's great!

My mom bought this TV for us on August 31st. Approximately one month later, it would start to just randomly shut itself off then restart. I did some googling and discovered that this is a common issue for Vizio TVs. (We'll be sitting here watching Netflix or regular TV and all of a sudden the screen will go black then the \"V\" logo will appear and it will be on regular TV. It even logs me out of Netflix completely.) I tried unplugging the TV and holding down the power button and then plugging it into a different outlet. That didn't correct the problem. On October 26th, I sent an email to Vizio to request that they fix or replace the TV. They suggested doing the same thing I had already done (unplug, hold power button down, etc.). I tried that again and the TV went a whole 2 days without restarting.So I emailed them again on November 14th and they gave me a customer service number to call. I called that number today and the guy on the phone told me that it would take about 5-6 days to repair and they would send someone out. Then he realized that the TV would have to be sent in and was going to schedule that. So basically they wanted me to send in this defective TV and then sit here with no TV for the next two weeks while they fix it (one week for shipping back and forth, one week for repairs.) This isn't acceptable, especially for a product that apparently has this problem a lot and is clearly defective. It's a $250 TV. Shipping and repairing it would cost that much. I just want the stupid thing replaced. Why should we have to sit here and go two weeks without out when the problem is on their end? I can get my car repaired in less time than that.Bottom line: don't buy this as your main or only TV unless you're prepared to spend a couple of weeks without it so it can be repaired.UPDATE January 2014: In spite of many attempts to get this resolved with Vizio, I have reached a dead end. They tell me to send a copy of the receipt and when I do, they tell me that large files have to be sent to a \"photos at vizio dot com\" email address. I've done that twice now. The first time, I received a reply that no cases with my incident number or email address can be found even though I used the exact same case number and email address as I've been using for over two months and numerous emails. The second time, I received absolutely no response.Vizio's idea of customer service seems to be \"ignore the customer and eventually they'll give up.\" They don't care if they lose a customer because another gullible one will come along.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesomeness!", "Author": "B.

Maybe I can just buy another Roku.Gave it 5 for the picture, 3 1/2 for sound and 3 for everything else.UPDATE: 04/21/13Ok, I have had this TV for about 4 days now.  I had a bit of time to play with it yesterday and today.  I fiddled around with the sound and have it much more acceptable.  I also have messed with the color and have it pretty much right on.

Instead of WPA2, set the settings toWPA-PSK [TKIP] + WPA2-PSK [AES].  If you change it to just WPA-PSK, it will not use the full speed of the router.Once I made the changes to the router I went into network settings on the TV and I had to manually input the router name (SSID) but then the rest was easy and it connected quickly to the VIA interface.I also changed my ratings on the TV to 4 stars total.  I would have given it 5 stars but they do not explain to you in the setup process about the router.UPDATE: 05/05/13I have had this TV for about 3 weeks now and am very impressed by it.  Color and picture is as good as any I have seen in the big box stores.  Only complaint I might have is the remote, but Amazon sells qwerty keyboard remotes for $20 or less and I might try one of those.As far as complaints from others about how long it takes to turn on,I have a 6 or 7 year old Sharp and it takes about that amount of time to come on as well.And complaints about the Internet connectivity, I think a lot of that comes down to your ISP feed speed and router.

It's the first wifi enabled TV I've ever owned and but since I have minimal cable line-up there, I knew I'd be depending heavily on video streaming from Netflix and Amazon. Also, since there is only one HDMI port on this model, I wanted the wifi feature so I could use the HDMI port for a game system rather than a Roku.This is a slim profile television and the stand is one that attaches from the back rather than underneath so it only needs 14 1/2\" headroom. It measures slightly over 22\" wide and about  6 1/2\" deep with the stand attached.The ports on the back of the TV include 1 HDMI port, 1 USB port, 1 RF port, 1 RGB PC port for connecting to a computer or laptop, Composite and Component ports, 1 Ethernet port, a coax cable port, a headphone jack and a 5.1 digital optical jack.It features 1080p resolution and is 60Hz. It has an LED screen and is plenty bright. The picture is crisp and the colors vibrant. It's a little slow changing channels and even slower using the internet apps but I'm not surprised given the price. The menu system is well done and easy to navigate.The remote is of the short and wide variety, which I like, and is comfortable in your hand. It had dedicated Amazon, Netflix and M-GO buttons also. Unlike larger versions of this TV, there is no keyboard on this remote. Instead, an onscreen keyboard pops up during setup for things like entering your wireless network name, passwords, etc. There is no back lighting on the remote.There is no users manual included. Instead there is a Quickstart Guide which walks you thru basic setup and then directs you to the onscreen users manual. I usually prefer a printed owners manual but this actually makes sense as you can't lose it.Vizio has it's own streaming video apps called VIA, just as Roku has \"channels\". There is a VIA button in the center of the remote which brings up an onscreen dock with all the pre-installed apps. You can also add more apps by opening the Yahoo!

I would recommend this TV to anyone, so long as they are aware of two key possible shortcomings:1) The viewing angle.  Rather than the traditional pedestal stand, this TV stands more like a picture frame, and rests on a triangular foot attached to the back.  The configuration causes the TV lean back a few degrees, rather than being perpendicular to the table top.  This causes no issues if the TV is viewed at eye level or below, but when the TV is above eye level the angle causes a very significant degradation of perceived image quality.  In my case, I purchased it for the bedroom, and with the TV just a few inches above the bed, the image quality was terrible due to the angle.  My solution was to purchases a $20 tilting wall mount to compensate.2) Only one HDMI input.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best little TV for the price", "Author": "Jason P", "ReviewID": "R27FGAJ6UXXI4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this TV to hang on the wall in the kitchen using VideoSecu Articulating TV Wall Mount, Full Motion Tilt Swivel and Rotate Articulating Arm for Most 15\" 17\" 19\" 20\" 22\" 23\" 24\" 26\" 27\" LCD LED TV Monitor Flat Panel Screen with VESA 100 ML11B A63.

It's not enough to bother me and I only notice it on a completely black screen. One bit of advice - if you get a wall mount, get the one that is a square plate that attaches to the tv, not the vertical bar type.

No fuss with the set up of the base or putting it up on a shelf.  It fires up quickly and without drama.  We plugged in our HDMI components and were off in no time.  One downside, while naming the inputs we had to use a slow onscreen keyboard.  The worst - some genius set up the keyboard alphabetically.  Really?  Why do some manufactures insist on doing something so illogical when most of us use QWERTY all day long?Other than the typing the set up was quick and painless.  Getting online was also easy.  We love that we can even connect to our Plex Media Server using a Vizio widget.  Overall the widgets and their layout are not as smooth as our ROKU2 XS for online materials but if one is really disinclined to shifting to a different input it'll work.Remote's a mishmash of buttons.  Seems like an engineer designed it and did not consult with anyone about ergonomics.  No backlighting, mostly uniform button design = obnoxious in the dark.  The most annoying thing...no sleep button?  Come on, a TV this small is really going mostly in bedrooms so why can't the designer be considerate and put sleep right there or make it really easy to access?  Overall it'll work but we're going to get another Harmony for the room so we can use the Directv, Roku and this TV easily on one remote.More important, to me, than the online/widgets, would be the crisp, clear sound.  At a volume setting of only 10-11 the TV's sound is bright and nothing is muddled (unlike that horrendous Panasonic).  Ah, good sound reproduction for such a cheapo TV.The picture quality also seems several notches above the Panasonic.  We needed very little fiddling to get to a nice image with deep blacks.  Still, as this is a cheap TV, the blacks aren't as dark as I would prefer.  This'll do as it's a bedroom TV.  From various angles the TV image still works nicely.Overall, I'd suggest this TV in a second.

I haven't fiddled with any of the color adjustments because to me, the picture is pretty darn good as-is.  The Internet applications (Netflix, Amazon Prime) work as expected, although I used a wired connection rather than WiFi because the WiFi signal seemed poor.  Recommended!BACKGROUND:  My six-year-old Samsung 37\" TV died, and I wanted a new TV for the upcoming 2014 Olympics.  Frustrated by a Samsung product that was used very lightly over the last six years and that I paid over $1000 for that TV, I opted to try another brand.  I thought about getting an LG, but I read a user review about a horrible LG product failure and subsequent warranty experience, so I moved to try Vizio instead (I understand that every brand has 5-star and 1-star experiences alike, including Vizio).  In my home, I hook-up the TV to my stereo for sound, so I don't care about the sound from the TV itself.  I don't use cable or satellite, but I do watch HD sports programs over-the-air.  My family likes streaming movies from Netflix and Amazon Prime, so the \"smart\" part of the TV was an important feature (good-bye Roku, you served us fairly well....).WHAT I LIKE:- Gorgeous picture, right out of the box.  Blacks are black/very dark, whites are brilliant white, color depth is great, contrast was great.- The viewing angles are all very good for where we have the TV placed; they are notably better than our six-year-old Samsung TV this TV is replacing.- The \"smart\" TV functions work well, are fairly easy to use (searching is a little difficult given the remote control's lack of a QWERTY keyboard).  We've streamed Netflix and Amazon Prime movies without a problem using those built-in apps.- It was very light to pick-up and move around- The slender, 42\" diagonal profile barely fits into my existing entertainment armoire (where six years ago, only a 37\" TV would fit because of the bulkier designs back then)- It has 3 HDMI inputs, which for my needs, is sufficient- It has component input for our Wii- It has an RCA audio output for easy connection to our stereo (an optical audio output, too, for when we upgrade our home sound system)WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- I miss the swivel base of our old Samsung TV; this base doesn't swivel, but it's easy enough to reposition if you need to (tip: place felt underneath the TV stand to make it easier to move- The Wifi signal it received from our router seemed weaker than what our Roku could obtain, so I switched it to a wired connection instead- The remote control doesn't have back-lit keysCONCLUSION:  Visually, I'm very pleased with this TV.  I bought a 4-year Square Trade warranty, though, so I don't have to buy another TV anytime soon.

First, the sound quality is pitiful. The speakers are smaller than most tweeters, and the sound they produce is hollow and tinny. There is no bass volume whatsoever. If you want full sound, plan to hook up a receiver or a set of computer speakers and make sure they have an optical connector for digital sound. Secondly, there is both missing information and misinformation on the Amazon page regarding the remote control. The remote control has NO qwerty keyboard. This was a big deal for me. I bought this TV specifically to use Netflix, and guess what? When I tried to login to my Netflix account I could input my user name, but I couldn't input my password because there was no on-screen keyboard. I was dead in the water.When I contacted tech support on the Vizio website, they repeated said that an on-screen keyboard would pop up. It didn't. When I asked if there was a qwerty remote I could buy, they said \"There is NO qwerty remote for this TV.\" I was about ready to send the TV back when I decided to try one more time. Being a puzzle solver, I went back to the Netflix screen and reversed the sequence. I put the password in first and the user name second. It worked. I got an on-screen keyboard both times. Lastly, there ARE qwerty remote controls offered on Amazon for this TV. So my question to Vizio is why on earth would you offer an 'smart' internet ready TV with loads of APPs that require qwerty input, but not include a qwerty remote? That is just plain cheap and dumb marketing. And why would you deny that such remotes exist when they are for sale on Amazon? Wake up! You not only lose a star from me, but probably a lot of return customers.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good picture, terrible DLNA and slow interface", "Author": "D. Sauer \"Unix Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R3VSTSGUNNL0Y5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So, to start off, the picture is very good.  The anti-glare treatment on the screen works pretty well, and the off-angle viewing is very good both to the sides and vertically (important if you're, say, mounting this for view in a bedroom where you may be either standing up or laying down while watching).  I also liked the way that the stand attaches and removes, as it doesn't leave a stupid piece sticking out on a wall mount (the necessary allen wrench for attaching/removing the base was included, too).  It's got a nice downward-angled attachment for the power cord and the jacks on the back orient plugs parallel to the wall, so you can mount this quite close to a wall.  The frame also looked nice, though it felt pretty cheap / flimsy.  But how often do you handle a TV? :)However, the primary reason to get a \"smart\" TV is, IMHO, for the smartness.  And this TV is not very smart.  First, to connect this thing to a network, you must agree to some asinine Yahoo! Internet applications terms of service.  How the heck is Yahoo! even relevant anymore?  Whatever.  I had no intention of using Internet apps; I only wanted to view content from my own local network.  But you can't set up the IP address or otherwise connect it to a network until you agree to the click-through agreement.  Fine, I finally gave in and agreed.  Then, once you've done that, you're greeted with a *very* slow to respond set of apps.  Each app takes a fairly long time to load, and there are some pretty useless things on there.  Again, as I mentioned, I only wanted DLNA support to play videos and music from my existing media center network (XBMC on Ubuntu Linux, for the curious).  This POS not only takes *forever* to load the list of content (like, minutes), navigation is terrible.  No artwork is displayed, and, the best part, nearly no formats are supported.  Most all of my video is in mp4 format, which pretty much everything supports.  Not this - everything comes back \"this format is not supported\".  Go to Vizio's web site to find out what's supported, and all they have is a page saying that some formats may not be supported.  There's no list of what is or is not supported, just \"some\".  Ugh.  Look around online at formus, and people are talking about how bad Viso'z DLNA support is.  Granted, it did stream mp3s ok, but again without album art (all of my mp3s are tagged with id3v1 and 2 tags, with embedded album art) - and it was really slow to start playing them (over a nearly idle \"wireless n\" network).  Also, it does not broadcast on the network as a DLNA display device, so you can't do things like have your phone auto-discover the TV and play back to it.  It's a very, *very* minimal DLNA device with a sketchy implmentation of what they actually did finish (e.g, UTF support is broken, certain headers cause the TV to crash, etc).For what it's worth, I also used the Amazon instant video app.  While that app technically works, it also doesn't work well.  It does not provide access to your \"watchlist\", so you have to search for things you marked on something like a Roku or a better device.  There's no indication of video quality or now long it'll take to initially buffer, so if you're on a slow link, you just watch a wait cursor for however long it takes to get a video started.  It takes longer than necessary to navigate through available videos.  In summary, the Vizio Amazon app is unsurprisingly as poorly designed and unresponsive as the Vizio DLNA support.I returned the item indicating that it did not match the description on the page.  The product description says it's a DLNA-compatible smart TV, but that's like saying a child's tricycle is a car on the basis that it has more than two tires.  I bought a Samsung UN32EH5300 to replace it.  Sure, the Samsung was $100 more, but everything actually works on the Samsung.  Even the VESA mount is better; the Vizio mount used some really tiny metric bolts which were a different length on the top and the bottom, while the Samsung uses much more substantial bolts.  The Samsung's DLNA support is also way better; much faster loading (on the same network) and a better interface.  Also, there was no stupid clickthrough privacy agreement on the Samsung. :)With all that said, if you just want in inexpensive 32\" LCD, the Vizio is not bad; it has a really good picture, and the remote isn't enormous.  But if you actually intend to use the \"smart\" features at all -- especially DLNA -- keep looking; I suggest the Samsung.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect For Me", "Author": "Anne Heath", "ReviewID": "R3L2WKSFA07PQM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV was delivered in less than 48 hours, with not a scratch.

I wanted something that supported DLNA as I have a media server with rips of our DVDs & Blu-ray purchases.Overall the TV is very nice.  The presets aren't too bad, and once you turn off the adaptive backlight control the picture can be really nice.  The one place where this panel can struggle is in really dark scenes, where even with all the noise & artifact reduction set to the max, you'll still see the noise in the background.  It's definitely more noticeable compared to the Samsung 47\" LCD we have in the living room.  It doesn't make it unwatchable and after about 2 weeks with the TV I am noticing it less, but likely only because I'm getting used to it.  In bright colorful scenes, this TV is absolutely gorgeous and you'll be pleased to have it, when watching dark shows like The Following, there will be scenes that are hit or miss.  Sound is actually pretty decent for these super thin TVs coming out now.  There does seem to be MORE sound directed BEHIND the television than in front, but it seems to direct it in front fairly well.  A sound bar would likely be a worthy investment for this TV ( or most ANY thin TVs now ), but it's not required ( just makes sure it's not against a shared wall if you're watching TV really loudly :) ).The three places where this TV kind of falls short are: DLNA Video format support, overall interface & the remote.  I think most everyone here has touched on the interface so I won't go too much into it, but it is slow & clunky to deal with.  Sometimes it is so slow it's difficult to know if it responded to your last input.  DLNA video support is very limited.  MP4 playback is non-existent, MKV also fails, and very few AVis actually play.  I updated my twonky server ( runs on a WD MyBook Live ) and it finally started to play some of the AVIs better.  I then updated the firmware on the TV and I had Amazon streaming too which is nice, but the UI is far from ideal.Finally, the remote.  The remote is terribly weak, where it has to be pointed DIRECTLY at the lower left corner of the TV for the commands to register, and if there's even the slightest blockage forget anything working.Overall, I don't reget the purchase, and getting it for $479 + tax is definitely a steal for a \"Smart\" TV of this size.

It arrived at my house the DAY after I ordered it via amazon prime. The TV itself was packaged nicely in the Vizio box, which was inside another large shipping box.I found the instructions for setup very easy to understand and do. I assembled the entire TV myself, although honestly there wasn't that much to do--just attach the base. I am quite small, so if I can physically set this up on my own, virtually anyone can. I find the base very sturdy and it looks sleek. The TV itself is very thin and looks so modern. The finish is glossy. The tech side of set up was just as easy, following the instructions included. I connected to my wifi network with no problem.Netflix and Amazon instant video work seamlessly for me. This was one of the main reasons I wanted this TV.

The SmartTV function is great, and I love that all my TV features are so effortlessly worked in to one remote control.The picture is absolutely stunning. My friend has a Samsung plasma television and says my picture quality is lightyears better. And, the LED means no glare if you have many windows in your home that stream in sunlight.If you're trying to decide whether to go with the 120Hz feature or save some money by going 60Hz, I definitely recommend the 120Hz as this TV has. I can tell a noticeable difference in how clean and clear motion seems on the TV. If you watch a lot of sports, it is extremely apparent just how little motion blur there is. It's something I didn't really notice before with my old TV, but now that I have it I can see a visible difference. It just looks so great.I found this TV to be quite a good deal.

The initial picture was not as sharp as our other Vizio and it seemed kind of dim. I tried numerous picture setting changes without much luck. I went online and found a post from someone who had purchased the calibration discs for this model, he then reposted the various setting for brightness, contrast, color, etc. I tried entering those settings, which helped a little, but the picture still wasn't near as good as our 42\" Vizio.Next I called Vizio Tech Support. They were helpful, and walked me through several setting adjustments. It's still a little better, but not as good as our other set. I would have thought that this smaller set (39\" vs 42\") would have a crisper picture since they were both 1080p and 120 Hz refresh rate, but it isn't. It's acceptable, just not great.The remote isn't great either. It would be nice if the keys had backlighting, especially since this TV is for our bedroom and the lights are typically off when we are watching. The buttons are also quite close together, which makes it hard to hit the right button, especially if its dark.I do like the wi-fi feature and internet apps. I like the dedicated buttons on the remote for Netflix and Amazon Video (because I subscribe to them both), but there is also a dedicated button for \"M-Go\". I wasn't familiar with M-Go, but did some checking. It's a pay-as-you-go video rental service. Their selection is not very good and their rental pricing was not very attractive. Unless something changes with M-Go, I don't think it will be around very long. Maybe that button can be reprogrammed in the future if M-Go goes belly up.The initial set-up for was pretty easy and I didn't need to try to run an ethernet cable to the device because of the built in wi-fi, which made set up simple.Maybe I just got a bit of a lemon.

I watched the reviews pour in which were mostly good so I decided to take the plunge. Set up was quite easy even if you are a novice at this. Several things to note. It's a little chintzy of Vizio not to include a remote with a keyboard. As one other reviewer noted, you can buy one that works with this tv and I did. I took my not so old Vizio this replaced to my vacation home. Compared to that one, this tv take about 20 seconds to boot up from first being turned on. That is quite a long time. Lastly, I tried settings that one other reviewer mentioned and the color reproduction was awful. Everything was somewhat iridescent (like dayglo colors). After two weeks of messing around I finally found the key. The default backlight setting is at 80. Another setting allows you to turn off this fixed setting and lowering it finally made the color reproduction to lifelike as well as eliminating pixelization along high contrast edges.

Glad I did not spend a lot of money on this one6 month update:  Still have to restart quite a bit as I will turn it on and nothing happens.

Also, would it kill Vizio to allow us to label channels? My cable does not come with a cable box, and the channels are not labelled. It should take very little effort to put in a function so I can name channels. Throw us a software update Vizio. When you use the smart TV it creates a new temporary input. So if I am watching Hulu, for instance, and I switch to my xbox, that temporary internet input goes away. So you have to go through the entire system to restart an internet video. Also, the HDMI inputs on the back are recessed with a ledge opposite the opening that makes them very difficult to plug in to. And the remote has to be pointed lake a laser at the receiver on the bottom left corner of the TV. Seriously, if you just point it at the center of the TV it won't work.

It fits with room to spare in my 30 inch wide wall units in my small (12 by 20) living room. It is so much smaller than the former Sansui 32 inch CRT it replaced that I bought a one drawer glossy black modular storage drawer unit and put it under the TV to store DVDs, remotes, manuals, etc. The narrow edge design is probably the reason why it is not as wide as other competitor's sets or even other Vizio models with a 31.5 inch screen size. Setup took all of 25 minutes, including doing two scans for digital off-air channels (I assume scanning for cable channels without a box would be similar). I was able to connect my digital HD cable TV converter box (required by my Bright House service for its HD channels and premium channels) using one of the TV's two HDMI ports, then connected my DVD player via the composite RCA female jacks and my amplified off-air antenna to the female coaxial cable/TV port (hence a 32 channel \"backup\" in case the cable goes out). There is also a USB port that allows inserting a flash drive so that you can view photos on the TV. I will be buying a second HDMI cable so that I can connect my HP Pavilion multimedia notebook with a HDMI port to view movies, etc. In addition, this is a Smart HDTV and has several Internet apps already configured, and more can be downloaded. The TV established a connection with my encrypted wireless g/n home network with a \"hidden\" ID without a hitch -- just type in the network name and the WEP key, wait a few seconds, and you are connected for Hulu, Netflix, etc. (no Roku box required). If you want one of these, I suggest you act fast ...

For the price and a 50 inch tv it is great. The features you get for the value like built in wifi is also great. Picture quality is good. Sound quality sucks. Well then again no flat screen has ggod sound lol so no complaint there. The only real downside to this tv for the first 7 months is the warm-up time. You can take a nap waiting for the tv to turn on. Again this was all acceptable for the price.Now for the disaster. Ive owned this tv for 9 months now. One month ago the Tv began Flickering and having lines going through it bad. Like 50% of the screen. Not all the time. It has its moods. Some days normal. Other days when im already in a bad mood it is as well. You all can relate to that. Anyways I monitored it for a week and then called Vizio as Im under there standard warranty for purchaseing a tv. Well first they make me check this and that power cord etc and nothing worked. Then they went on to the cable box being the issue. So I say my dvd player does it as well. Either way that phone call went no where. Followed there steps being re-assured everything would be ok if we just did things step by step. So I did the cable box and even went as far as to have my cable tech speak with them over the phone while he was here.After finally admitting that it could be one of many different problems like main board, this circuit or that....blah blah it was basically a defect in there tv. So they tell me they will fix it for free. Well heres the real kicker. I have to MAIL the tv back to them. Now two problems. One I live in a small house so i was unable to save the tv box it was shipped in. And two I have to pay to SHIP the tv to them. That is not the kind of service I expect from a company that I just spent 750.00 on one of there products. And if most of you are like me a hard working blue collar person, well you know we can afford a tv of this purchase once every 7 or 8 years.

Even with our less than spectacular internet connection, and this set being in our bedroom, over 30 feet from the wireless router, and through 3 walls, reception has been spectacular. The picture is twice as good as our 6 yr old Toshiba Regza 42\" set. We use it to stream Netflix content quite a lot, and not only do most shows/movies come through crystal clear, with true color and deep blacks, but Netflix streams about 2x faster than on the larger tv outfitted with a little Magnavox media box, less than  12 feet from the wireless router. The sound quality is acceptable to our ears and another really nice thing is the usb port not only allows movie and personal photo viewing as well as music listening from a flash drive, I discovered that a WD 2 TB external hard drive is recognized and we have the option to play several hundred files from that. Of course it doesn't play all file types, but quite a few. I find the speakers good enough for me to listen to Pandora internet radio in the mornings and to enjoy it. Haven't hooked any periperals up via HDMI as yet, but a DVD player attached to the composite jacks looks excellent, so I imagine the HDMI hook ups should only be better.  If I had one small criticism of this tv it would be the remote is a bit clunky and when pressing the buttons its not as smooth as many others. Button pushes make an audible click, but it does work. This unit only came with a 90 day 3rd party warranty, being a refurb, so I will update this review if there are any changes in performance or our feelings toward it, but so far this is the best set I've ever owned, by a wide margin, and I'll be taking a hard look at the 47\" Vizio when it comes time to replace our Toshiba.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst TV ever for streaming", "Author": "Lucia Fedina", "ReviewID": "R2BI5YLELTG91J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The TV has many problems.

Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to youNow first thing when a TV says its LED that is very similar to LCD.  The main difference with this type of TV is the way the lighting within the TV is done.  LED is back-lit better so that their are no dark spots on the screen.  The term SMART TV means this TV has the ability to directly connect to the internet.  But what makes a TV a smart TV is its ability to connect all of your devices together.  The Smart TV is the train conductor that can push content from your DVD's, game systems, and other devices to the TV.The next step is to look at the features that are offered with the TV. Here are some offered by this VIZIO Smart TV:SMART TV Internet Apps this TV has built-in Wi-Fi which allows you to watch internet content like Netflix, rent movies through the TV.  Pretty much whatever you can do on your computer you can do on this TV.- With LED backlighting the pops with rich color and vivid details.- This LED HDTV is up to 50% more energy efficient than conventional LCD HDTVs to save money.- The slim frame design for this VIZIO lets you maximize your space, allowing you to fit a bigger screen size TV in the same space.- Here is the input/Output layout: 2 HDMI, 1 Component, 1 Composite (shared with component), RF Connector for Internal Tuner, 1 Ethernet, and 1 USB 2.0.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT DEAF FRIENDLY", "Author": "Bond, James Bond", "ReviewID": "R2A776ZOCWTH3A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is our first HD TV and we are freaking loving it! The main points are that we use Netflix as a TV provider instead of cable or satellite, so having a Netflix app and a Netflix button is too cool. I am not a tech guru so i can't say too much about the technical stuff but I do know that LED is the way to go, 120Hz is the latest and greatest and wifi connectivity means I can cut out one device. The thin frame should be standard on every tv, it makes this 47\" seem larger.stuff I'm unhappy with- no browser and no Pandora. It does however have rhapsody but I don;t have a rhapsody account because Pandora is free. And one more row of RC inputs would have been nice but I understand they're not as en vogue as they used to be.*update, one month in- ah shucks the list of stuff I'm unhappy with has grown  Amazon app does support captioning ( big mad judgmental look going to amazon for that one)  The remote has to be pointed DIRECTLY at the lower left hand corner of the tv. Changing batteries on the remote to a higher quality battery has helped, however its not the free ranging point wherever stuff of old.  And last of  all, when you start viewing a show and when you skip the image takes a few seconds to come to. It gives a strange pixilation that one might mistake for a few beers too many vision. Not the worst stuff in the world, just minor annoyances. But it still shows  great picture right out of the box! Nothing major to gripe about which means that this TV is holding its own!*** Update 10 months in Pretty ticked about the continued lack of captioning support particularly from one of the quick app buttons.

She put me through a work out of shutting it down, holding the off button etc. to no avail. She asked me for serial number. Gave her the number on the set and the box it came (both the same). She said no such number. I would have to take a picture and send it to her. Enough of her. ( Ah to be young again and not care about anyone but me) Went up the ladder to supervisor Steve, went through the process again with him, gave him the serial number, he told me he would order the parts, when they came in a repair person would call me and set up an appointment, also said it would take 5-6 business days.

However, I began to have problems with the TV where it would freeze up.

After multiple hours of time spent with customer support, I was told that there was an incompatibility issue with my wireless network such that it caused the TV to lock up. I was told that I would have to either disable my WiFi network (then what would deb the point of an internet TV) or disable the Network or File sharing function of my WiFi network. I was also told that it may have something to do with how the TV is not DLNA compatible. I have a standard out-of-the-box network from an Apple Airport Extreme, nothing fancy. I wouldn't know how to set up anything fancy with my network anyway. I spoke with Vizio by phone and email more times than I care to count.

I bought this to replace a bedroom TV (not a Vizio; a Magnavox). The picture is great and it does a good job in automatically adjusting the aspect ratio for different channels. The sound is quite satisfactory for a small TV. The front-firing speakers clinched my decision (as they did on my slightly older Vizio). Most TVs today have rear-firing speakers (I suppose so the electronics companies can subsequently sell auxiliary speakers for $120 or more). Having speakers fire against the living room wall is just silly. The only thing I don't like is the stand, which is a simple lean-to. \"Swivel\" is unnecessary for such a lightweight TV, but \"tilt\" to change the viewing angle would have been good. Unfortunately, the old TV's stand would not work as it had a different VESA hole placement. I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a smaller TV - great price. Setting up the WiFi is a snap. Interesting to note that the Netflix interface on this TV is slightly different and a tad friendlier that the Netflix app on the slightly older Vizio. I use Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon.Edit on 3/6/14: I saw my review showed up for this TV in a listing by vendor One Stop Shop.

The user interface (UI) installed on the Vizio E320i-A0 is Vizio's crippled Yahoo! TV Apps/M-GO interface, NOT the company's \"Vizio Internet Apps Plus\" interface.  It is clunky, frustrating, limited, and NOT user friendly.  While the TV is just fine as standard TV or monitor, and has a decent picture, adequate sound, and plenty of inputs, the UI is terrible and the remote is almost worthless.  It is not a good value as it comes at a premium over a similarly appointed HD set, and you can save nearly a C-note and a whole bunch of frustration if you simply buy a \"dumb\" 32-inch HD set and a Roku LT from Amazon.I purchased this TV in January 2013 on Vizio's promise that it would provide an outstanding Smart TV experience.  It was anything BUT outstanding.  Its primary app, \"M-GO\" (prominently displayed on both the unit's UI home screen and its lousy remote control), was billed as a \"revolutionary\" TV experience when I purchased the TV.  Bizarrely, M-GO wasn't installed on the TV at the time of purchase and didn't even become available for it until Summer 2013.  When it finally did arrive via Vizio's eventual firmware update, M-GO turned out to be all \"pay\" TV - no included content.  It was thoroughly disappointing and not \"revolutionary\" as promised.  I already have Netflix and Amazon Prime, so I don't need their lousy pay app.  Aside from M-GO, there are other apps available for the E320i-A0 -- some are preinstalled like Yahoo! Finance and Skype, but most are downloaded through the Yahoo! TV Apps store in the unit's poorly structured UI.  Strangely, Yahoo! TV Apps offers only a very limited number of apps for this \"smart\" TV -- a grand total of 134 (that's right:  ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR!) as of this writing on December 26, 2013 -- and most of them are either local news station apps from distant corners of the U.S., or paid anime/cartoon channels. Even the familiar apps like iHeart Radio have limited feature sets and don't offer the programmable, personalized channels you would customarily be able to set up on your computer or smart phone, but rather offer only a specified set of broadcast stations from select markets.  The entire experience is really bizarre.Ultimately, the greatest disappointment of the E320i-A0 is its abysmal UI and limited apps, which Vizio flatly informed me it has no intention to update to its current \"VIA Plus\" interface.  Again, the TV is good in terms of picture, size, sound and inputs, but the \"smart\" content is worthless.  If you buy this TV you will be stuck with the lousy UI, crappy remote, and crippled apps.  Be forewarned, and get a \"dumb\" TV and a Roku (or Chromecast, or XBox 360, etc); you'll be much happier you did.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vizio E-500i-A1  50 inch Smart HDTV  It is a winner!", "Author": "Mary Wright", "ReviewID": "R2FDLWJUDHJ4H2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered it off of Amazon and it arrived within 2 days.

It is operated solely by the remote, as there are no on-board accessible tuner controls. The setup is easy and dummy-proof... and you can't beat the picture and audio performance.

After all, the technology has improved quite a bit in the last 7 years, but I was sorely disappointed! The picture was dull, flat and not all that sharp. I wondered if I had made a $648 mistake! But it was getting late and my wife and I had to leave for church. When we got back a couple hours later and turned on the set, we were greeted by an on-screen message telling us a firmware update had been installed. The picture now looked entirely different; bright, vivid and beautifully sharp. The viewing angle is amazing; any seat in the house is comfortable viewing. The remote works at almost any angle and is pretty straightforward and user friendly, although I'm stumped as to why there are 2 buttons (INFO and GUIDE) that perform the exact same function? Well, I guess it's always good to have a backup. I haven't used the \"smart\" features yet (with the exception of the automatic firmware update), so I cannot comment on how well streaming movies works. Bottom line: I love this set! My only regret is that I couldn't afford the 60-in. over the 50-in. But I can live with it.

Until this problem occurred, the TV reception was outstanding, pulling in about 20 local channels, of which seven were in crystal clear high definition.  The TV also produced very good video from an up converting DVD player connected through the HDMI input.  Setting up the wireless function was quick and easy and I enjoyed listening to music through Pandora.Putting aside the catastrophic failure of the OTA TV reception, my only complaint with this TV lies with the small built-in speakers - the audio sounds tinny and anemic.  This, however, is not a major issue for me since I have a small home theater system connected to the TV through the TV's headphone jack.  The TV also has a digital optical output jack, but my inexpensive home theater receiver lacks a digital audio input, so I get stereo audio from the TV through the left and right front speakers in the home theater systemWhen I encountered the problem with no TV reception, I immediately called Amazon's technical support.  The tech rep suggested several possible fixes, most of which I had already tried and when it became obvious that there was a major problem that could not be resolved over the telephone, the tech rep arranged for a free exchange for a new TV.  Fortunately, I was still within Amazon's 30 day return period on my original purchase.  I just received the new TV today and it is working properly.  I will supplement this report as I get further use with the replacement.This 24 inch Smart HD TV offers a lot of bang for the buck and I am hoping the replacement unit, unlike the original, gives me many years of use.  If you purchase this TV, or for that matter any other electronic product, from Amazon, my suggestion is that you give it a heavy workout during the first 30 days.

It was easy setting up the wireless connection, just needed to point it to the right network and punch the password and viola! I mainly used it for Netflix and the picture brought down from Netflix was pristine. But I eventually started running into trouble with it constantly dropping the WiFi connection. To fix it I had to restart the whole TV. I even went into my router's settings and made sure that there was no chance that anything in the router would mess it up, but it still consistently dropped the connection (and it doesn't seem like I'm the only one). So I ended up buying a Google Chromecast to plug into it (USB port in this TV works for supplying power to the Chromecast), and the Chromecast has worked flawlessly. Hasn't dropped a connection once, which should be embarrassing for Vizio that a tiny $35 HDMI dongle can outperform the streaming capabilities of a 32-inch TV set.Though I wish the connection was stable, it was still a decent buy.

Hohauser", "ReviewID": "R2L84GJUDSI4P7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this after getting fed up with my 24\" Samsung TV's lack of an audio out, getting up to manually switch an audio selector and having to manually adjust the audio when I want to watch a BluRay or NetFlix. Unfortunately many TVs now lack an audio out that follows the change of video input. Vizio is one of the few companies that still offers this feature in moderately priced TVs. I had purchased a Vizio 32\" TV in the past year for a relative and was pleased with the image so I wasn't worried about picture quality much although I knew that it would probably be a step down from Samsung's high quality.First of all, after fidgeting with the cable box to get the audio thru the HDMI, the analog audio out works well and the sound is good thru my speakers. But my warning to you starts here. Vizio has programmed the set to do a lot of \"intelligent\" automatic adjustments out of the box. The most noticeable is how the image is constantly adjusting itself every time a scene changes or the camera pans to a different image in the same scene. This is probably fine during a baseball game but during an average TV show or movie it's changing all the time. This irritated me to no end so I spent a few minutes and turned off every automatic function in the picture menu. From there I manually adjusted the image to my liking and it's been great ever since. The same goes with the audio, there a few automatic functions that I turned off and now it's sounding great thru the external speakers. The internal speakers are OK, better than on the Samsung but not much.Now that the set is up and been getting daily use for two weeks, I am very happy with it. The only issue I have is the loud pop it sends out on the external analog audio as the set warms up. This may not happen with the optical audio out but I can't test this. I have not tested the Smart TV part yet as my BluRay is already set up for this although it is so slow I might be tempted to see if the Vizio is faster.Update: I finally decided to switch the internet connection over to the Vizio as I was getting frustrated with how slow my 3 year old Samsung BluRay player would take to update and to switch from selection to selection for internet content. The first thing you have to do is accept some sort of Yahoo service with checkboxes, you are not asked for any info. As I wanted to watch something only available on NetFlix online I set up the account which was reasonably easy. There are other on-line options on the Vizio which I haven't tried. Netflix booted up quickly and the quality of the image is much better than the Samsung BluRay player. However, I quickly noticed that all my manual settings for the image and audio had reverted to the factory defaults. The picture went back to adjusting itself in the middle of scenes. So I went thru the menus and set everything to manual again. Not sure why this happened but the very first time i turned on the set, the Yahoo acceptance selection came up automatically. I ignored it so possibly it's somehow hooked into the initial set-up of the set and it reset everything when I finally accepted it. Keep this in mind if you purchase the set. The Vizio already did a software update since I hooked it up and it did it totally in the background unlike the Samsung BluRay player which prevents you from doing anything until it is finished.This is a very good television.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Led", "Author": "rcarb", "ReviewID": "R2P6OVIGNCZXJZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I research most items from user reviews all over cyber land  before buying them as i did with this one.

The design included a space for a wide-screen TV.  The designer misinformed me about the size of the space so I purchased a 26\" TV.  It was a nice TV but I wanted the biggest TV that could fit into the 29.5\"-wide space.  I hoped to fit a 32\" TV in the space, but the smallest 32 had a 29.5 width.  I thought about ordering it, but opted to not risk it. I, therefore, purchased the 29\" VIZIO instead.The bezel is very slim, so the TV easily fits in the allotted space. The price is definitely a bargain.  My BIL purchased a 30\" HD about 7-8 years ago. The image quality was not nearly as good, and the cost was at least 3 times as much.  The IQ on the VIZIO is good in standard def, and excellent in HD.  That really isn't much of a surprise since it is much easier to produce a 29-30\" screen than a 52\" screen like I have in my bedroom.  Moreover, the capabilities are excellent.  I'm an Amazon Prime Instant Video user.  To see IV movies on my other TVs, I use a Blu-Ray player that has WI-FI and extra functions built in. It's always a hassle switching from regular TV to the extra functions.  By contrast, on the VIZIO, there is a dedicated Amazon IV button built into the remote! In fact there are two other dedicated buttons for NetFlix and U-GO. In addition, it appears that there are 4 additional buttons that can be programmed, presumably to access other services. I have to give the TV a top score for added functionality.However, I have to deduct a star for the construction.  VIZIO must intend this TV to be wall mounted because the stand is the crappiest piece of design I have seen associated with a high quality electronic product.  The stand is basically a flimsy piece of plastic that screws into the back.  Like a desktop picture frame, it points the TV upwards at about a 25 degree angle.  For me, this is unacceptable since the TV is already sitting on a shelf that's almost 6' above the floor. I had to put something under the stand to shift the angle.  This fix doesn't leave me with the greatest confidence that I won't lose the TV due to an accident bump or earthquake.Therefore, if you plan to wall mount this product, it deserves 5 stars. If, however, you need to employ the cheap stand, then the TV leaves a little bit to desire.Regardless, given the incredibly low price, it's hard for me to complain to loudly.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but Wi-Fi Reception is Spotty", "Author": "Jeremy Carr", "ReviewID": "R2S596JSLNFD6W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great picture quality and overall features on this TV, but unless the Wi-Fi router is extremely close to the TV it won't work.  It even says the signal is strong, but won't connect to online apps.  Looks like some other reviewers have diagnosed the problem.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "It seems ok, but it's not what I was hoping for.", "Author": "BobbyB", "ReviewID": "R1EGZ0QWJEAY3S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The one thing that pushes me to say I don't like this unit is that it emits (intermittently, but at least as, if not more often, than not) an extremely high pitched tone that emerges, especially when the volume is pushed up due to low volume levels on the program I am watching.  It's way up there, maybe in the 10-12Khz range.  I don't know why it's there, and I've considered using the square trade protection plan to see if someone will come here to fix it.  I'm not going to bother shipping it anywhere.There is also another factor I'm none too crazy about; but this isn't specific to the unit, itself, rather to all new 16:9 aspect ratio televisions.  If something is in the old 4:3 aspect ratio, it looks fine on this (or any 16:9) screen, because it fills the screen from top to bottom, and, obviously, goes only as wide as 4/3rds of the height.  But very few things are displayed anymore in the old aspect ratio, except for commercials.  Almost everything is in a new aspect ratio that is NOT proportional to screen size.  This new format seems to be some sort of hybrid meant to work, more or less, with both aspect ratios.If you zoom in, you get full width, but part of the top and bottom of the picture is cropped off.  This is usually (but not always) ok for viewing.  But if you are zoomed and using the menu of your cable box to see what else is on, the very bottom of the screen (for my CSP) shows the date; and that date is gone.  Zooming can also be a problem with subtitles.  The date is always cut off, and  subtitles are often cropped too when zoomed, forcing a change in aspect ratio to normal, which then reduces the size of the image on screen with a lot of wasted space on the sides, and a bit less waste at the top and bottom.  That is an annoyance.  But, as stated, this is by no means a problem unique to this particular unit.I'll be replacing this 32\" unit with a 3rd (38.5\"--\"39,\" nominal) HDTV, and relegating this unit to my spare bedroom, where it will rarely be watched or heard at all; and, if/when it is watched, it will be from much closer so that the smaller picture won't matter nearly as much.  I'm also replacing a 37\" unit, from another manufacturer, in my living room that's not quite 2 years old, because of this aspect ratio problem.  Both of these units will be a bit larger (wider) than I'd like, but they will fit in the areas I have available for them and should solve the screen Image-size problem.I was going to go with another Vizio (so I don't dislike the brand), but I was unable to find a single Vizio that has two inputs for older styles of video equipment, Component AND AV.  That led me to go with 41.9\" (42,\" nominal) unit from the same manufacturer as the 37\" unit I'm replacing, because that one does have TWO inputs for things that aren't HD.How much could it cost per unit to include two of the old style inputs, instead of just one?  I have old VCRs, a DVD Player and a Blue Ray player hooked up to the 37\" unit.  All I'll have to do is unplug everything from the 37\" T.V. and plug it all back into the new 42\" T.V.  Nothing needs to change in terms of how it's plugged into my home entertainment amplifier.In both cases (the 37\" and the 32\" HDTVs) I was replacing old 4:3 aspect ratio T.V.s.  Two years ago I was replacing a 3:4 27\" with the 37\" HD; and, a few months ago I replaced 3:4 25\" with the 32\" HD.  One thing you never see in the stores where they try to sell you these new things, is a smaller picture framed by black.  But that's what you get with these new T.V.s and that \"hybrid\" format--unless you zoom in, which is by no means without its problems.Go with at least a 37\" to replace an old 3:4 25\" T.V.  I went with a 38.5\" Vizio to replace the 32,\" because the newest, sleekest designs by Vizio seem to weigh less than comparably priced T.V.s by competitors and have a narrower width, overall, because there is only a very narrow frame around the screen.  And go for a 42\" to replace a 3:4 27.\"  For the same viewing distance this should keep image size about the same for broadcasts in the newer format, without the need to zoom.  Things broadcast in the old 3:4 format will be very much larger with only some wasted space on the sides, but the entire signal will appear on your screen.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Smart HDTV", "Author": "Akbutter", "ReviewID": "R25OFWXEPMX3OP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is awesome.

My Samsung was a 720p DLP. This is a 1080p LED. My wife immediately noticed the difference when I was playing 1080p content. She mentioned several times to me how beautiful the picture is. I sensed she was skeptical when I bought it because I don't think she has ever heard of Vizio before. I had though, so it wasn't a concern for me.- The sound is pretty good. I noticed when I watched Jurassic Park on this tv though that it lacks bass (during the title sequence with the loud booms). When I had my Samsung, I had the video and audio running through an Onkyo receiver. The sound coming through the 7.1 speakers clearly blew away anything out of the tiny speakers in this tv (which I presume are larger than some thinner tvs).- Because this tv had 4 HDMIs (4!), I could hook up all of my devices without needing an a/v receiver. I sure do miss the bass though, but I'm in a town-home. My neighbors probably have no complaints now.- Built-it Netflix and Amazon (to name just two) saves me from having to run my 2nd generation \"fat\" PS3 (another 300 watts).- In about a month of using this tv, I have saved 200 kilowatt hours and some money too on my electricity.Cons:-The remote is terrible. It is nice to have built-in buttons for Netflix and Amazon, but this remote requires you to press hard to get a response. Sometimes, you don't even know if the press registered. I replaced it with a programmable Logitech Harmony. This tv also requires you to point your remote directly at the sensor on the lower left corner of the bezel, or nothing happens.-The Internet apps, including Netflix are slow to load and buggy.I ordered it here at Amazon, price is just amazing: http://amzn.to/13ErHQn", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow!

Vizio did mention that because Internet TVs are new, the servers aren't as good as what you would get in a computer or even a game console. As a result, even if an app like Netflix is running fine on your computer you may have problems on the TV (especially if you have a lot of devices hooked up to your Internet, which I do).

They have a very responsive customer service system in place, that you can contact by phone or email, although it's only available during normal business hours (which is frustrating, as I usually don't watch my TV/have problems with it, during normal business hours).My experience with this TV has been very mixed. We bought it for its \"smart\" features, so that we could stream Netflix and Amazon, wirelessly, but this feature only works about 50% of the time. When it is having a good day, it's beautiful, streaming video effortlessly, with a gorgeous picture and sound. When it's having a bad day, I spend the whole evening digging through trouble-shooting info online, emailing the Vizio customer service people, since they have usually gone home for the day, checking my wi-fi signal, restarting my cable modem and router, and resetting the TV to default (which is usually what the customer service folks tell me to do, anyway).The last point has become the most frustrating aspect of owning this thing. Sometimes, resetting the TV to default actually works, so the hopeful, optimistic side of me gives it a try. This means that you have to re-enter all of the required data, not only for the TV itself, but for all of your streaming accounts (email, passwords, check-here-if-you-agree, etc.). You would think this would not be too much of a hassle, but consider that you have to do this using the arrow & enter keys on the remote, often scouring a non-QWERTY keyboard for the right letter. If any of your passwords are long and have both numbers and upper/lower-case letters, this can be a bit hard on one's positive state of mind.Another thing you should be aware of is the sensitivity of the wireless feature, itself. We bought a new Cisco E2500 wireless router, anticipating the purchase of this TV, which beams a full signal throughout our 1920's era house (with its plaster and expanded steel lath walls), and out into our backyard. We also recently bumped up our internet subscription to the highest speed (thinking maybe the 20mbps we were getting wasn't enough for our poor Vizio). Often, what happens is that the signal doesn't show up on the TV at all, or shows a signal that is at about 2-3 bars - much weaker than what our laptops, iPhone, and kindle show (all of them showing full signal strength). Last night, after trying to get it to work for an hour, we gave up and watched Netflix on my laptop...BOO.So, ultimately, I have given up on this TV being \"smart.\" For the money, it's a good quality TV for the picture and sound, but the wireless features are so sketchy, they are practically non-existent. At this point, we will probably buy a Roku or some other external device for streaming wirelessly.  A \"smart\" TV is a great concept, but this is our second one in this price range, and both have offered a similarly disappointing experience (we exchanged the first for this current one - god bless costco). I would say that as there are so many positive reviews on this TV, that we must be the common denominator where our problems are concerned (our old house/the metal lath in our walls), but then I can't account for the strong connectivity with all of out other devices. As far as I'm concerned, it's all about the hardware, and the cheap components in this TV are reflected in the affordable price.There. Now I feel a little better.

Peace", "ReviewID": "R2HA7RC3FIL392", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would rate this TV 5 stars but the one I received has defects.TV has 4 HDMI inputs. HDMI 1 works perfectly fine all the time. However, the other 3 have an annoying habit of losing signal 2-3 times for each hour of viewing. Doesn't matter if the input is from SAT, PC or Blu Ray. While viewing content, every 20 mins (or so), I get a \"No Signal\" message on the screen of the TV which lasts one to two seconds. It's not the HDMI cables because I have tried different cables only to experience the same. It's not a big deal, but it is annoying. I've had this TV for 5 months and it has done this since day one.The other annoyance is the TV's built in media player. I can play an .AVI or an .MP4 video, and part way through the movie the player will just quit and go back to the home screen. Doesn't happen during every movie, but probably half of them it does. None the less,  it's annoying to watch three quarters of a 2hr movie only to have the player quit. I then have to restart the show and fast-forward to the point in the movie where the player decided it would quit. UGH!Having noted the defects, I will say this TV has cool features. The picture quality is good, better than the 5 year old 46\" Samsung LCD it replaced, and it is totally customizable to suit your tastes. Its wireless streaming of movies works flawlessly. I use a sound bar for audio, but the sound quality of the TV's built in speakers is decent enough to where you could probably get away without using a sound bar, if you have a smaller room. Also, the price of this TV is more than competitive with other similar offerings.So you may be thinking; why doesn't he call customer service about those defects?

This one was the winner. It has a few extraneous things, but for the most part it's a lean, mean, picture making machine.I have one complaint, so let me get that out of the way first. On assembly, there are three parts and six screws. Three screws attach the vertical stand to the back of the TV, that's simple. Three more screws attach the vertical stand to the base. That part is a bit more interesting. there is some sort of clip that feeds in to the base. I accidentally broke this on trying to put it together. I don't think it really matters, the screws are what hold it all together anyway. I was just kind of annoyed that there seemed to be no way to put it together without breaking this little tab-like piece. It's a little thing, but something that you should know when you go to put the thing together.I'm thrilled with the picture quality, the size, the thin bezel, the overall thickness of the screen, and all of the features. I don't feel the need to list all the features here as you can easily get those just about anywhere you want.I will however, talk about some of them that are especially handy.There is a HDMI port on one side of the TV which is great for devices that you might not have plugged in all the time or might want to borrow an HDMI cable from. It's much easier access than the other ports. The Component port and standard Phono plug ports are sort of combined, so if you think you can plug your N64 in along with an xbox using component cable, you're out of luck. The component ports are GBR for video and of course RW for audio. The G component port is also the Y standard definition phono plug port. I really appreciate whoever designed this though. The ports are vertical on the back, a little recess near the bottom allow for the port placement, but the diagram is placed facing you so you don't have to stick your neck back there at an awkward angle to understand where the ports are. I had some trouble with the coax port, but that could have also been the antenna so I won't hold it against the tv.The menu setup is great too, everything is extremely navigable.

Even though Samsung is our favorite brand, we didn't want to spend Samsung $$$ this time.Also, we really didn't really want a 'smart' TV, but I gave up looking for a dumb Vizio in the size we wanted after brief search ( I'd originally planned to get a Roku to hook to it).  I LOVE Roku.PROS:- I'm not one to want to mess around with picture settings if I don't have to, and fortunately it worked fine for us right out of the box. Other reviewers have plenty of suggestions for tweaking the picture, but I did nothing, and we're happy with it. It's not quite Samsung sharp, but it's close, and meets expectations for the price I paid (about $460).- The sound is OK - but I may add a sound bar later.- It connected to my wireless network right away with no issues.CONS:- The whole Internet Apps thing seems very clunky. I mean it works, I suppose, but as another reviewer pointed out somewhere, it has the look and feel of something out of the 1980's. The whole app GUI/menu process just looks antiquated. From the available apps I only really care about Amazon Prime, which itself has a gaping whole - there is no way to access your Watchlist. You have to 'search' for anything that is already in your Watchlist in order to stream it. I'll probably eventually ditch using the apps and get a Roku anyway.- The remote is almost ridiculously small, and the buttons follow suit. A real PITA when working your way through the above mentioned search feature in Amazon Prime.But overall, we're happy with the purchase.

As the title suggests, the TV lacks brightness, I have never seen such a dim LED screen on another TV. At first, it was completely awful, ANY source of light reflected on the screen and made it impossible to make out any detail on the video behind that light. My parents have a small lamp on an end table with a 40 Watt bulb in it, which was covered with a lamp shade and still caused this, no matter where you sat in the room.However, once you go into the setting and turn OFF the ambient light sensor, \"Luma\" setting, and Auto dimming, it's not nearly as bad. It's still not great, but even during the day with some sunlight on the screen it is possible to watch something and see what is on the screen. So the auto-dimming feature is basically so aggressively trying to save power, it dims the screen too much (or maybe it just can't accurately tell how bright the room is). Again, once you turn off all those features it's much better, probably a 4 Star viewing experience, though the power use will be MUCH higher than normal with those features off.So why the 2 Star review then? The first TV my parents bought was the 47 inch version, and they loved it. They especially liked the smart TV features and only bought the 50 inch version because with the black Friday special it was 3 inches more screen for 50 dollars LESS money.However, the first 50 inch TV they got had a faulty wi-fi adapter in it, so none of the smart TV features would actually work. They called Vizio and Vizio's support rep was completely unable to help resolve the issue. He told them that the TV needed to be only 25 ft away from the router at most because if they put higher quality wi-fi adapters in the TV's it would cost 600 dollars more for the TV (which they got for 500)! They explained that they had basically the same TV and it worked in the same spot, and he continued to assure them that Vizio uses junk parts to save money and it wasn't going to work no matter what.They took the bad TV back to the store and haven't had any problems yet with the new set. So the lesson here is that if you call Vizio with a warranty issue, they will likely tell you \"Of course it doesn't work, we use cheap parts\". I didn't believe it, but a Vizio employee who claimed to be a manager repeated that line to us about 20 times.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good TV", "Author": "David A.

AS an added plus:  The mounting or setup base is unique to Visio only and makes it to fit into smaller places without looking so big and out of place!  In all the other TVs, I found not one that sat so low and firm/stable.  I needed to fit this into a corner spot in my home office and it not only works great, it looks fantastic.

It suits my general viewing purpose very well. Primarily have it hooked up on an antenna to receive local channels in HD or standard broadcast. The smart function allow me to also view streamed programs if I choose.The picture quality was good out of the box.  The screen is very clear, bright and capable for all lighting conditions. HD programs were crisp and clear in 720P. However, after adjusting the picture setting in the menu to my preferences the picture quality is now very good to excellent.  I definitely recommend turning off all the automatic picture enhancement features then, adjusting the settings back to your own personal taste. There are a couple of older reviews that can help with that chore. Its worth the effort.The built in WiFi works well for using Netflix or Amazon prime programs.  Set up was fairly easy on the WiFi. I am also impressed with the built-in audio. The speakers are louder and better than the older 32\" LCD this one replaced. The remote is very basic and has small buttons which could be a problem for some people. The remote buttons also do not illuminate.So far the only thing I was not impressed with was the flimsy, light weight, stand.  It also does not much of a footprint compared to the older 32\" TV stands it replaced (also a Vizio). So stability could be a concern with the stand that comes with the set. But the stand is not a big concern for me since I wall mounted this TV, just like the older one before it, to a very secure bracket.The one thing I have not done with this set is watched DVD's or BR disks with it. So I cannot speak of the dynamic range. I highly recommend this set for general purposes viewing.

I bought the 39-inch model because my living room is tiny, and it's just about the perfect size for my viewing distance. The built-in apps are all you really need but you can add and delete apps (yes, it's actually possible to delete the useless Yahoo apps). You do have to sign up for the Yahoo app store but that's painless. I had no trouble at all getting the TV to recognize my WiFi network, and connecting it to Netflix and Amazon Prime couldn't be easier.The slim-bezel design ensures that none of the picture gets cut off. Of the brands I shopped before buying this TV and experience with friends' TVs, Vizio and Samsung seem to be the best at not chopping the bottom of the screen off. Panasonic and LG cut off a significant portion of the picture on all sides, and Magnavox cuts off quite a bit too.TV reception is solid, the tuner has all the latest DTV technology and it has no trouble with my indoor antenna. Fast-motion shots in football games can be problematic if your local station has any sub-channels eating up their bandwidth but as long as the source signal isn't compressed too much you won't notice any artifacts. Picture quality is incredibly sharp and the built-in speakers are all most people will ever need but it does support external audio devices if you are a surround-sound aficionado.The coolest thing about the Amazon Prime app is that while you're searching on the left side of the screen for the video you want to watch, the live TV picture scales down to the remaining 75% of the screen on the right so you can browse for the latest Downton Abbey episodes while your local meteorologist talks about the weather. Of the video-streaming apps on this TV, the Amazon Prime app is the best.Netflix comes in a close second. Navigation is easy and video quality is second to none, as long as the video is available for 720p or 1080p. Some TV shows that were produced in HD are only available on NF in 480p resolution, but the TV handles those well. I was actually surprised when I was watching a David Tennant-era Doctor Who episode and the TV reported that it was only receiving a 480p stream from NF.The YouTube app is kind of clunky but when it's playing videos it plays them back without any problems, and you can sign in to your YouTube account so you can use the website to find videos and put them in your Watch Later list, then get to them from the TV without having to deal with the app's search function.The only app I was disappointed with was Hulu Plus. The video was washed out, and the sound was tinny. I hooked up the Xbox and played the same video using that Hulu app and the video and sound quality were great, so this is a fault with the Hulu Plus app for Vizio. I contacted Hulu support and they were not helpful. Most of what I wanted to watch they still don't have rights to stream to TV or mobile devices so I canceled my free trial anyway. Therefore the Hulu app's shortcomings are a non-issue for me. If you want to use Hulu and have a game console or other streaming device, use that for Hulu, not the TV's Hulu app.The media player app can stream videos, music and photos from your PC running media-streaming software such as TVersity. Combined with Windows Media Center (free) and a TV tuner card, I've made this my DVR.This is by far the best TV I have ever owned.

After much debating, I took a gamble and went with my gut with this 47\" Vizio Smart tv.The first problem was with the shipping. I ordered this through Amazon Prime, the amount of time it took to arrive was great, 2 days just as expected. The problem was upon seeing the box there was a HUGE hole that was larger than the diameter of a baseball bat. My nerves went through the roof with the hole seeming severe. I took the actual tv out of the shipping box and noticed a hole in it. The hole was smaller, maybe the size of a half dollar. Which doesn't make sense when compared to the size of the hole in the shipping box. I removed the tv and was fortunate that the holes were on the backside, and there wasn't a scratch (miraculously) on the backside of the tv even. I am really hesitant to purchase a tv online anymore after this experience.After removing it the set up was simple. The stand screws in easily with 3 screws. The only thing I don't like about the stand is that it doesn't swivel. With a 47\" tv you don't need to swivel much so it's not a major concern, but it would be nice to have easier access to the HDMI ports and such. I was amazed that this 47\" tv is A LOT lighter than my previous 32\" HDTV that was purchased 7 years ago that I was replacing.The onscreen set up was easy. I am still trying to adjust picture settings to get a good picture because it's just not too great for me out of the box. Shouldn't be a big deal to keep tweaking the custom setting. I have Verizon Fios connected through HDMI. I am a big NHL fan so immediately I turned on Center Ice. I notice there is a little lag with the players. Maybe its my eyes just not used to this size of a screen. I'll give it some time to adjust. I wouldn't expect lag with it being (supposedly) 120hz.I checked out some of the apps.

The pic was great and all but the software was soooo sucky. It was totally annoying having to reconfigure it whenever you turned it on since it always switched back to the default settings instead of keeping the current. 'Nuff said about it.Some of the dumb things you find with modern TVs these days is a delay after changing channels. You'll get a blue screen for 2-3 seconds (even some older Vizio's do this), followed by the sound a couple seconds later. There is no reason for this, other then bad design. This Vizio did away with that silliness so when you change channels, it's virtually instant. Sound comes along for the ride and it's on instantly too. Even when switching to a pixelated picture it's happy to go there, without the annoyance of jumping back to the previous channel like some TVs and VCR/DVD players do.The picture is great even at wide angles (though you loose some brightness), and although I'll need to have an articulated wall mounting device to allow 25\u00b0 tilt so I can watch either from my desk, or while lying down on the couch, I'd say that most won't have a problem with the viewing angles.In my small RV, it's a pleasure to have such a wide TV...compared to the old CRT 19\" it replaced. The thin screen surround (3/4\") is thin enough that it disappears into the background. And at only 22\" wide, it fits perfectly over my existing cabinetry without any extensive alterations or interfering with the cabinet doors on either side. Though I will do some cabinet mods at a later date.The WiFi feature was an added bonus at the price paid for this unit, and although it requires a pretty strong, local signal, once it's up and working, it's nice and stable. But if the signal is down to 2-3 bars, it tends to lose it. Then sometimes it doesn't even show the AP it was just connected to as available until you turn off the TV and back on. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.The built-in internet software favors commercial sources (the remote has direct keys for Amazon, Netflix, and M-Go, then there are several more commercial or pay-to-use sources, like Hulu, shown at the bottom of the screen when you press the VIA button on the remote) and although I haven't figured out how to just enter a URL yet, I expect I'll be able to. Haven't tried the Cat5 direct connection yet either. One thing they missed is that when entering the passcode, the typical cell phone shows upper case for the first entry and goes to lower case after you enter the first letter. The Vizio starts at lower case so you have to walk down to the control to set it up for upper. A minor annoyance as I find most passcodes start with uppercase. Strangely, when you need to enter a password into say, Netflix, the on-screen keyboard DOES work like a phone. Showing upper case first, then auto-switching to lower case after the first entry.The input sources available are more then just adequate, though I would have liked to connect via S-Video (no connector for that). Instead, I hooked up my computer and my VCR/DVD recorder/player via both HDMI and AV and the TV worked flawlessly. Push the remotes 'Input' button and a scrollable window pops up without blacking out the current picture...I like that. I also like that the picture scrunches up on the right side when you press menu, which shows up in a nicely readable box on the left taking up 1/3 of the screen. Navigation with the remote is fairly easy tho some keys could be larger, like the 'Mute' button. And the default settings for color, brightness and the like are perfect for me.Even the sound is better then expected. I will be going to a sound bar soon for improved dynamic range, but this TV is pretty good as it stands. Especially if it's sitting on a hard surface to reflect some of the sound from the front firing speakers and the passive rear grill openings.As a full time RV'er, it was a pleasure to find a TV like this that has such an easy to use 'Available Channel' scanning system. Many are so slow or have user unfriendly multiple pages as to be annoying. This Vizio is easy to use but as far as scanning speed goes it is about average, taking 5:45 to find 29 digital OTA channels. I am in a fringe area so that may have added some time to the scan. Haven't tried it on cable yet and I'm hoping for a faster scan with that typically stronger signal.For the price, feature set, and the quality, you would be hard pressed to find something that would beat the Vizio E241i-A1. For RV'ers who don't want to do extensive remodeling of their cabinetry, it's darn near perfect.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "K.

There was a minor issue the first couple of days in which I would get a No Signal message and the screen would go blank for maybe 3 seconds.  It would do this at random.  The second I sent an email to Vizio about the issue.  Got a response in just about an hour.  Their recommendation was to unplug plug everything, all the connection cables and the power cable.  Then press and hold the on off button for about thirty seconds, before reconnecting everything.  That did the trick, the problem has not recurred since the fix was done. I like the style, and though the remote is small and does not have a qwerty keyboard ( a minor annoyance) it i does work well and is reasonably easy to navigate through the menus.The colors are vibrant and after going through all the settings and then making my own custom settings, I am quite pleased with the picture quality. I do not use the TVs speakers since I connect it directly to the home theater sound system so I cannot really comment on that feature, though I have never really heard any TV speakers that sound all that good, especially when compared to a good sound system. I read a few comments about the stand that comes with the system.  Some said they did not think it was not a secure as it might be.  I find the stand to be more than sufficient to handle the set with no problem.I was a little leery of the Vizio brand since I had heard of it but had never really know anyone who owned one, but I decided for the price and features that I would take the chance and I am very pleased with the TV and the support from Vizio. Great TV - Great price and so far great support. I t was delivered on time, and it well packed and the packaging was Eco friendly for the most part.

I know many times I'll cut the TV on in the morning or while my kid is sleeping on the couch and I mute it because it's so loud, but it's still going to be loud when I turn it down, but with this TV I don't have that problem.* The apps pop up on the side when you select them and you can size your screen to where it doesn't cut it off while you're looking for something.* The slim frame makes it seem as if it's floating in the dark, you feel like you're at the theater.Picture:The quality is extremely good with HDMI, the streaming through WI-FI, and an antenna. With sports there is a big difference in this and the 60 hz, plus it has settings to make it even better. It takes a while for it to come on (compared to other TV's) as others have said, but honestly, why is everyone in such a hurry for their TV to come on? Are you really that impatient to where you can't wait 60 secs for TV when you're probably going to watch at least 30 mins?Apps:The only ones I really use are the Netflix and Amazon. Netflix is laid out the same as my PS3 and I like that, but it does seem to buffer slower and takes a while to get a clear  picture. The Amazon app, doesn't have a place to select your watchlist (that I've found) so you have to search or dig for anything you want to watch. I'll probably use my PS3 more for Amazon, but it is convenient to not have to turn on a separate device. Youtube works good playing from the phone most of the time and I really like that feature. I'll update on other apps once I've used more, but haven't had a chance or need yet.Antenna:It was easy to set up and scan for channels and the picture quality was amazing, not to mention I get better reception with it. It actually tells you what is on local channels, how long it will be on, and gives a short description, just like cable or satellite would.Sound:This is one spot where the TV doesn't hold up well against others. The sound isn't terrible it's just not great. I will definitely invest in a sound bar as soon as I can. The speakers are on the bottom BTW. UPDATE: If you change the sound from Surround to standard it sounds much less distorted and is still plenty loud enough.Stand:I used a wall mount, but the stand seemed very solid and was very heavy so I think it would have done just fine.Remote:I like the convenience of the Netflix button and Amazon Prime button and the buttons are easy to read and it's laid out fairly well. It's small and light and points very easily. You can have it facing any where near the TV and it will work.Hook ups:The hook ups are easy to get to on the side (which is good if you want to plug something in temporarily like a phone or computer) and even though the ones that are facing downward are hard to reach it makes it where if you're mounting to the wall you can get it very flush. There are more than enough hook ups to fit just about anyone's needs.Overall, I couldn't find a TV that beat this one for the features and price and I couldn't be happier.

Why is Amazon now combining all kinds of different size and model Vizio TVs in this single review thread? This is a disservice to users. It is confusing and inefficient.===========================================================================This 29 inch Vizio TV is the perfect size for viewing when the TV is sitting just beyond the foot-of-the-bed. The slim profile and light weight makes it easy to fit into tighter spaces without sacrificing quality or comfortable viewing.The TV is capable of remarkable color and clarity. However, it did take me a while to customize the settings for optimal color and picture quality. The default setup does not reflect the picture potential that is available with careful tweaking.My personal preference (your mileage/taste may vary):Advanced Picture -> Color Enhancement -> GM/BlueAdvanced Picture -> Luma -> MediumAdvanced Picture -> Backlight Control -> OffColor Temperature -> CoolPicture Mode -> Custom-- backlight -> 41-- brightness -> 37-- contrast -> 42-- color -> 51-- tint -> -2-- sharpness -> 10The remote control (RC-29\") took some getting used to. I often like to control with \"feel\" instead of sight. Since the RC-29\" thickness is uniform and the top and bottom are both rounded, it is easy to grab the remote in the dark and not know immediately whether you are holding it from the top or bottom. In contrast, the RC from my other Vizio 16\" TV is, in most respects, more ergonomic. The RC-16\" was longer so buttons were more spread out and easier to locate in the dark. The RC-16\" also had a smooth battery bump on the back, making it much easier to determine top and bottom in the dark. I would have just used the old RC-16\" to control my 29\" Vizio except that the RC-29\" had channel numbers at the very bottom, making it easier to select channels by \"feel\" than via the RC-16\".I also use a tiny $60 Android/TV box about the size of a fat harmonica that connects to one of the two Vizio HDMI ports. It gives me full internet web access (via wi-fi) and access to plenty of great apps, essentially a small Android 4.2.2 computer using the TV as a 1280x720 pixel monitor. Although this box is capable of being powered by the Vizio USB port, I prefer to use an external powered USB hub. My favorite app is the XBMC media player allowing me to easily access, via wi-fi, my notebook's USB hard drive's 1TB of movies, MP3s, and various other media files.LINK: hypercube.us/forum/index.php?topic=1202.0The Vizio E291i-A1 29 inch HDTV would be a great deal even without its wi-fi capabilities.

I selected this model based on the Amazon reviews, then bounced over to Conzumer Reportz and found that it was one of the top rated models in this size.  Based on my first week's use, I have to agree with both the Amazon and CR reviewers.  The TV is super light weight, and therefore a breeze to mount on a wall (it also comes with a plastic \"foot\" that lets you set it on a cabinet or table if you want).  Setup was very simple -- it connected to my router through the built-in WiFi connection, and registering the TV to my online media accounts (e.g., Amazon Prime for TV/movies) took a matter of seconds.  The picture quality is very good -- better than I expected for this price.  The sound is OK -- good for a second TV, but if I planned to watch a lot of movies on this set I'd probably hook it up to better speakers.  The web content apps (Amazon Prime, YouTube, Netflix, etc.) work well and easily, but the load times are significantly slower than on my PC, and typing on the on-screen soft keyboard is slow.  The TV does not have a general purpose browser, so you're limited to the apps Vizio supports.

The tv arrived quickly (thanks Amazon Prime), package was undamaged and I waiting a couple days before I installed it. I set it up and it seemed as if all was fine. A couples days later I noticed a stuck pixel towards the upper left corner. I was hoping it would go away after a few on off cycles, but several days later it was still stuck in the purple mode. Then one night while watching a program, I went to adjust the volume but it didn't work, I then tried the channel up/down button and got no response. I tried to turn it off and could not...even tried the off button on the side. I had to unplug the tv and reconnect power before things would work again. I notified Amazon and it was an amazingly painless process to return the tv and get a replacement. The new Vizio E320i-AO arrived in 2 days and I removed the first one from the wall and set up the second. Now, this is where I noticed a difference. Even though both televisions had the exact same model numbers on the back, there were differences between the 2. The first was lighter, had buttons on the upper left side and the energy sticker said $6 a year average cost to operate. The second was a bit heavier, had a thicker plastic back (I had to buy longer M4 screws to attach to the same wall mount brackets). The buttons on the second tv were on the lower left side and the energy sticker indicated $8 per year average to operate. I decided to look at images of the Vizio E320i-AO online and all that I could find were the same as the second tv that I got. Even the box for the second tv was different than the first one. I don't understand, unless Amazon was trying to get rid of old stock??? Amazon, can you answer that one? Amazon also offered me $30 credit if I would keep the  defective first tv...which I declined.Now for the review of the second set. It works perfectly, the colors are great, the remote never fails and the Vizio apps are pretty good. CNET's review was spot on for the TV, I suggest you watch it. The backlit LED is nice, but it does make the TV a bit thicker....but who watches from the side? Hanging it the wall is easy as the tv is less than 20lbs. Viewing angles are decent and I haven't noticed and blurring or tearing, but really haven't watched anything that would really test it either. The wireless connection works extremely well for me, but I also connected a wireless router to my LAN just to serve the tv. The sound is adequate, but I would like to get a sound bar with a wireless sub...that would make this tv a 10 out of 10.Overall, I am quite pleased with the television and would indeed recommend this set to others who want a 32\" tv in a smaller room or perhaps a bedroom.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "great value", "Author": "steve", "ReviewID": "R3CKNLGBKGQ1DA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great tv...loving it....;we like the wi-fi access and the size is great for watching sports, etc....good sound.....would make the purchase again....", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Audio...ummm", "Author": "Ruthie", "ReviewID": "R17B7KD4HYS2KC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*This review is for the 24\" tv*As far as visual goes, this is an awesome tv.

Up until this point we had a small tube style TV with built in DVD player we occasionally used, but I wanted something more. I did a lot of research on HDTVs in the 32\" range. I was originally tempted by a TCL slim profile TV, but the price shot up over $100 before I took the plunge. I had looked into a Sceptre TV and a a Vizio too.I decided on Vizio because their TVs seem to have universally good reviews, with good build quality and good picture quality. This particular TV is one of Cnet's top picks for the 32\" class. I chose to spend a little more on this Smart TV because I was interested in the built-in apps and wifi connectivity. We don't have cable so being able to use apps to watch the things we want VS paying more for a bunch of channels I don't want sounded appealing. I got mine on sale here for $289. It took about a week to arrive with Super Saver shipping (I didn't have prime yet), but arrived undamaged.I'm very happy I made this purchase. First of all, the picture quality is terrific. Really sharp, great colors and shadows, no distortion in fast action sequences (I watched the Avengers and Transformers to put it to the test). At may be 720p but at this size you can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p. I can't at least.Build quality is very good to. It seems nice and sturdy and even managed to survive being knocked over by a cat without a scratch (thank goodness, that was day 2 of ownership!). I also like the slim frame, it makes it look more elegant.Sound quality is good I think. Much less tinny than the Sceptre I was looking at. I'll probably buy some dedicated speakers at some point (I was thinking maybe the Sony SSF-5000), but its perfectly adequate.We still don't have cable, but I its not a problem. I got Netflix which has been great. Most of the shows I want to watch are available. I also just got Prime, which works well, but doesn't have as much selection that you don't have to pay rental fees for. For example, Futurama costs $1 per episode with Prime, but happily Netflix has all 9 seasons and all 4 movies. But I digress. It has a nice selection of apps including Youtube and hulu. Wireless streaming with Youtube doesn't work well in HD (takes forever to load), but Netflix and Prime are well optimized for streaming. The video quality is great most of the time and they adjust to keep the video from stopping to buffer most of the time.I ordered the tv with a couple AmazonBasics HDMI cables and Sony BDPS185 blu-ray player. Haven't actually played a blu-ray yet, but boy my DVDs never looked so good. The difference between composite and HDMI connection is profound.I've had the TV for about a month now and couldn't be happier. It fits perfectly in our small apartment and movie night is much more enjoyable, plus catching up on all the shows I've missed is awesome.

My first surprise was that this TV was noticeably lighter than the smaller unit it was replacing. Very nice. Mounting and connection was straight forward and hassle free,although it might be a pain to get it hung on the wall if I were trying to do it alone,but that is true of all TV's this size. Picture is as good as the Samsung that resides in the living room,so no complaints on that front. I would rate the sound of the unit as acceptable,especially for a bedroom application. Not all is rosy however. On two separate occasions,I have turned it on and the sound has been absent. Both times turning it off and back on has solved the problem,and I'm hoping it doesn't become a frequent occurrence. Now on to the biggest problem that I'm having with the unit. Netflix! The TV only connects to Netflix every 10th attempt or so. I've tried every fix recommended on the Internet to no avail. I've even tried connecting via Ethernet cable,but the result was the same. It should be mentioned that the TV has no problem connecting to wifi,I just tried the cable out of desperation. We use Netflix via the Wii in another room without issue,so the problem definitely lies with the TV. Hulu+ also refused to connect the one time that I tried it,but we don't use that service,so I've not experimented farther with that one. All of the other apps seem to work well. I enjoy watching full size HD YouTube videos. All in all I'm happy with the unit for the price paid($299) and would recommend it for regular TV viewing.

I relocated the TV and connected it directly, by wire, to the router.  I kept it connected to the internet by wire and logged the TV onto the internet several times over the next few days because customer support said it might help trigger the firmware update.

Using the Disney blu-ray calibration disk helped, but colors are still not as rich as other options.  Clarity of picture is excellent during normal or bright scenes.  Has trouble during dark scenes though.  Side viewing is OK, but quickly washes out the colors even more.Audio through built-in speakers is rather weak.It is a good looking TV with very small bezel and slight matte screen (rare these days).Takes 20 seconds to fully turn on which is annoying until you get used to it.Wifi connected quickly and easily, but seems to be limited to about 6 Mbps when my router is sending out 16 Mbps.  Confusingly, running an ethernet cable (Cat 5e or Cat 6 - I tried them both) limits speeds to about 3 Mbps when they should be higher with a direct connection.  A laptop connected to the same cable shows 16 Mbps download speeds.  Either Vizio is throttling the speeds or their internal speed test is off.  Either way, it does take a few seconds before Netflix will buffer enough to be able to show in HD.One annoying thing is the inability to disable unused inputs in the input selection menu.  So if you only have a cable box and DVD player connected, you still have to cycle through 7-8 inputs to switch between the 2 and you can't do this very quickly as it tends to pause at each input.  Not a big deal, but something Vizio could have easily fixed.Rhapsody doesn't work well - from what I hear from Rhapsody this is a problem between Vizio and Rhapsody.  Pandora works just fine, and while it's not included out of the box, it's easily added (for free) from the Vizio app store.For the price I paid, it's a pretty good TV, but if you're looking for rich colors and good black level performance, there are probably better options out there for a couple hundred bucks more.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "LTC", "ReviewID": "R3TBOOF988E8EL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV to be used as a computer monitor.

The quality of the picture is fantastic and although people complain about the remote... I like the simplistic design of it.  The sound also quite nice giving the low price of this tv.  When browsing through internet apps it is sometimes a little slow to respond but I would assume it only has a processor that is required, not comparable to a computer or gaming system.  The set up for this device was very easy, 7 screws and you are up and running.  Also, with the thin edge, it actually makes the screen size a little larger.  There are four hdmi inputs on the side and a composite towards the bottom of the tv.  In my opinion, this is a good layout because of how few devices use composite cables anymore.The only issue I have had is my device is taking some time for the firmware to update.  If you have issues with netflix (shows not playing) check your firmware version at the help menu and system settings.  I think the most current is 3.x, but when mine arrived it was only on 2.35.x.  As long as this automatic firmware update works correctly, I am more than happy with this tv.  And if it doesn't, vizio's support plus amazon's return policy... Still a good purchase.Oh, and shipping on this item was excellent.  I know some people are concerned buying electronics online because they may be tossed around or the box looks rough...

The picture and sound were fine, as was the lag.  I was happy with the TV.But then, after a long gaming session, I tried to adjust the volume.  That's when I discovered that there is an intermittent issue, with a high occurrence rate, in which absolutely no TV settings can be adjusted (this includes volume, power, menu access - literally everything).  The picture and sound will still work when this is happening, but the TV will not respond to ANY input from the user, whether it comes from the remote or the physical buttons on the TV.  I'm not talking about gaming here, just to clarify - I'm talking about the TV settings.  You seriously can't even turn the set off unless you physically unplug it.I contacted Amazon's tech support (you get it free for 30 days with this set) and, after an exhaustive call, the representative agreed that there was a hardware issue with the TV.  She told me what my options were at that point, and I decided to get a replacement set after she assured me that the rest of the TVs in stock had been tested and that this wouldn't be a problem with the replacement set.Well, I set up the replacement set today and it does the exact same thing.  To top it all off, both the original set AND the replacement set arrived after my \"guaranteed\" delivery date (which was not Amazon's fault - it was the courier's - but it is still frustrating).I called customer service about the new one and I am getting a refund.  I'm still a bit upset that I was assured that the new TV wouldn't have this problem (by an Amazon representative), but it did.This whole order has turned into a 3-week long ordeal, and I certainly haven't been compensated for the amount of time I've had to invest in it (setting up the TVs, re-packing them, taking them back to the UPS facility, etc.).  I was given a $30 promotional certificate, which was a nice gesture, but I don't think it makes up for the hassle of having to return two faulty TVs.I would recommend that people stay away from this TV.

Other brands of 24 inch tvs would not fit due to the stands.  Vizio's stand is different letting the tv base sits flush on the surface.  The picture quality is superb and that is watching an over-the-air (OTA) station from an outdoor antenna. Since OTA signals are not compressed, the picture is far better than the Directv picture.  I have this tv hard wired to the internet and the apps work fine. I have not tested the wifi, but, based on my other Vizio, I am confident that it works fine.

I replaced a Samsung DLP and Onkyo a/v receiver with this tv. I must say, this is the best value for my money and everything I hoped for (with the exception of a few minor issues).The combination of my Samsung and Onkyo setup was using 800 watts of electricity to run at all times, so this tv was a cost effective replacement at only 62 watts.  Plus, my onkyo receiver was flaking out, losing the HDMI signals multiple times during a show, buzzing through the speakers, and causing \"sparklies\", so it was time to junk it.Pros:The picture is awesome.  My Samsung was a 720p DLP.  This is a 1080p LED.  My wife immediately noticed the difference when I was playing 1080p content.  She mentioned several times to me how beautiful the picture is.  I sensed she was skeptical when I bought it because I don't think she has ever heard of Vizio before.  I had though, so it wasn't a concern for me.The sound is pretty good. I noticed when I watched Jurassic Park on this tv though that it lacks bass (during the title sequence with the loud booms).  When I had my Samsung, I had the video and audio running through an Onkyo receiver.  The sound coming through the 7.1 speakers clearly blew away anything out of the tiny speakers in this tv (which I presume are larger than some thinner tvs).Because this tv had 4 HDMIs (4!), I could hook up all of my devices without needing an a/v receiver.  I sure do miss the bass though, but I'm in a town-home.  My neighbors probably have no complaints now.Built-it Netflix and Amazon (to name just two) saves me from having to run my 2nd generation \"fat\" PS3 (another 300 watts).In about a month of using this tv, I have saved 200 kilowatt hours and some money too on my electricity.Cons:The remote is terrible.  It is nice to have built-in buttons for Netflix and Amazon, but this remote requires you to press hard to get a response.  Sometimes, you don't even know if the press registered. I replaced it with a programmable Logitech Harmony. This tv also requires you to point your remote directly at the sensor on the lower left corner of the bezel, or nothing happens.The Internet apps, including Netflix are slow to load and buggy.  I have had to unplug the tv once already (in about a month's total usage) because it froze while watching Netflix and I could not get the tv to respond.  The Netflix app also has an aspect ratio issue, meaning that, if a movie has letter boxing, sometimes the letter boxing gets smaller and larger multiple times during a movie. This results in an effect where it looks like the movie jumps (as it then occupies more screen area and then suddenly less when it jumps back).  The changes are uniform, in that if the screen size changes 1/4 inch at the top and bottom, it then changes back by the same amount (of course I'm eyeballing this measurement).  This does not happen when I watch the same movie on Netflix using my PS3.Why is there no Picture-in-Picture?Overall, I am happy enough with this tv for the amount I spent for it.  It would have been twice as much or more for a similar model from the bigger tv manufacturers.  I can live with and work around its flaws.

Built-in WiFi and \"smart\" stuff are nice extras.Took one star off for the Remote Control....its ok, but Vizio packages this TV with their cheap (non-QWERTY) remote.Do yourself a favor and buy the \"Vizio XRT302 Qwerty keyboard Remote\".  It works great with this set, and I was able to order a new one online for about $16.50 including free shipping.  Vizio should have included this one with the set.  grrrrRegarding the \"smart\" stuff (Vizio Internet Apps): I haven't played with other smart TV implementations, but the apps on this set seem slow to load and clunky.  For a set at this price point, I wasn't expecting much, so am not disappointed.  The split panel approach is nice: you can be inputting stuff on the left 1/3 vertical UI panel while watching content on the right 2/3 panel.  Forget using most of the app stuff (except Netflix maybe?) without a QWERTY remote though for anything other casual playing around.Since we already have an iPad2, we ended up buying an AppleTV, so with wireless AirPlay mirroring of the iPad display to the TV set through the AppleTV box, the iPad is acting as our \"smart\" (more like brilliant) capability.  The Netflix app on the AppleTV (or Roku) is a better implementation than what comes bundled with the TV or our Sony BluRay player. And with the iPad setup, we get what is really useful:  a web browser!!!!  Note that most iPad apps will not utilize the full screen of any TV (think 4:3 aspect ratio picture on 16:9 TV set) -- the app needs to be written to support \"full screen mode\".  The built-in Safari web browser on the iPad only shows up in non-full screen format, but we found a really good alternative called \"Perfect Web Browser\" that does, and one of the really cool things about it is that while you are watching a youtube video through the TV (in full screen glory) from one \"tab\" of the browser on the iPad, you can flip to another browser \"tab\" on the iPad (visible just the on iPad screen) to do other surfing.Back on the TV, we showed off the TV to a home theater enthusiast friend, and he was satisfied with what he saw, but commented on how the colors seemed a little muted or washed out.

This TV has a max resolution of 720p, but there is NO need to spend an additional $100-or-so for a 1080i or 1080p because according to every website expert (CNet, etc.), the difference between 720p and 1080p cannot be detected by the human eye in a TV that is under 45 inches wide.Got it home, set it up on the included stand, plugged in the power cord, plugged in the HDMI cable from the DirecTV DVR box to the TV, and finally, an HDMI cable from a Dolby 5.1 surround-sound receiver to the second of two HDMI inputs on the TV (it is optical cable and S-Video cable capable too).Set-up was a BREEEEEZE and took literally just minutes!! The onscreen menus are simple and easy to understand for a non-techie like me! The remote acts as a keyboard for choosing options. That being said, the only adjustment necessary was that I liked a little brighter picture, otherwise everything was perfect .. from the nice rich black to the vivid colors!During set-up, the TV picked up my home wireless signal immediately, asked me to give it a name, and to enter the network's wireless password. Netflix worked flawlessly with full surround sound! ... as did my other subscriptions.The remote has dedicated buttons to launch Netflix, Amazon On Demand, and MGo Movies ... but you can add ANY subscription you want to the on-screen menu (called a \"VIA Dock\"), for instant access (like Hulu, etc.), and put it in any order you wish! Totally convenient when one button away!The only criticisms I have is: 1) The black plastic frame around the screen is shiny (not matte), and it reflects lamps and other light sources. Not a problem, but still - it would be better if it was matte. 2) Can't sit too far to the side, but this is for watching TV in bed anyway. 3) The remote could be a tad larger.If you are looking for a small, smart, led tv with an incredible picture, RUN ... DON'T WALK to where ever you plan to buy - and pull the trigger!!", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV at a Very Reasonable Price", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R3MXW875ONTG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV as a gift for my parents and we are very pleased with it so far. Before buying this, I did alot of research on similar 47\" LED TV`s. The consensus was that for TV`s this size and price range the Vizio E Series was a safe bet and I couldn`t agree more. The picture is absolutely beautiful. The Smart TV apps are responsive. The set-up was very easy. Others have mentioned issues with the remote in their reviews, but I find that as long as the remote is pointed at the TV it works as it should.I`ve also read other reviews of how people have adjusted their picture settings according to CNET`s preferences. I value CNET`s opinion, so I tried their recommended settings with this TV.  In my case, where the TV is located, this does not benefit from their suggestions. I have this TV in a living room, perpendicular to a large bay window which faces south. During the day there is alot of sunlight in this room and CNET`s picture settings were too dark. In my opinion, the optimal picture is acheived with Vizio`s \"Retail\" setting in a room with alot of sunlight. There is almost no noticeable glare to speak of. There really is no general \"ideal\" picture setting. Every application has it`s differences, and it`s nice that this TV has the ability to be adjusted based on what yours are.The other thing I`d like to mention was my hesitation of ordering a TV like this online. I have always bought my electronics in an actual store as opposed to the internet for fear of damage incurred with shipping. This is the first time I`ve ordered something like this online and I`d like to point out that Amazon does a very nice job with the packaging. The TV arrived with not so much as a scratch on the box. I even ordered a 48 month extended warranty with this just in case. I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to others.

Out of the box I found the picture be a bit to saturated, even on the normal setting. After a few minutes of adjustments and turning off some of the features I had the set looking the way I wanted it. I'm dinging it a star due to two very small annoyances that Vizio could easily and inexpensively fix:1) The included power cord is only 4 feet long. That's way too short given how many people prefer to wall mount their displays or if your electrical outlet isn't located where you want your set to go. An 8 foot cord wouldn't be that much more expensive to include and it's always better to have a cord that is 2 feet two long than 2 inches too short!2) If you want to wall mount the set you'll need 4 M6x18 bolts as Vizio didn't bother to include them. Vizio also doesn't bother to say what size bolts you need in the included quick start guide. Again, it would cost maybe $.20-.30 to include 4 M6x18 bolts.Both of these problems could easily be fixed by Vizio and it would save customers from having to make an extra run to the hardware store. Otherwise, great set for the money.

T. Beasimer \"www.LBphoto.net\"", "ReviewID": "RWW7EUW6JRTN5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Grandmother wanted a small TV for her bedroom.  Based on her budget and wants, I found the Vizio E241-A1 24-inch Razor LED HDTV.  After a little more research I decided to add a few extra bucks in myself and get her the Vizio E-Series E241i-A1 24-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED Smart HDTV.Both are 24 inch LED HDTVs with 1080p and 60Hz.  The best that I can tell, the only difference is the ability of the E24li-A1 to connect to the internet to provide additional functionality and viewing options.Once I connected the Vizio LED smart HDTV to her Wi-Fi, I was able to set up her profile, update weather cities, and connect to Hulu.  Everything seems to work fine until I selected a show to watch in Hulu.  Grandmother's DSL based Wi-Fi speed is good enough for her limited use, but isn't fast enough to stream without buffering.  This TV doesn't buffer at all, so watching the show was stop and go to a point of being unwatchable.  I didn't expect buffering capabilities, although it would have been nice to know ahead of time this would be an issue.  Fortunately, watching Hulu isn't a feature grandmother is likely to use.I was able to teach grandmother how to check the weather and look at yahoo news articles.  She isn't internet or technically savvy, so it's clearly a simple to use and understand menuing system which allowed her to pick it up so quickly.  Plus she is happy with the picture quality and sound.  Even watching a little football, I couldn't see any ghosting or artifacts from fast action.If you're looking for an inexpensive internet ready HDTV, the Vizio E-Series E241i-A1 24-Inch LED Smart HDTV is worth considering.  Wi-Fi speed may be an issue for those looking to watch Amazon Prime Videos or Hulu Plus.  Even if Wi-Fi speed is an option today, I would still suggest spending the minor difference for the extra features.PROS:Good picture qualityNo ghosting while watching sportsSimple to use menu systemCONS:No buffering capabilities", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "47\" E470i-A0 product review", "Author": "Adam Wright \"Electrical Engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R2KLU9H336R6PG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV after looking at other manufacturers with TVs that have similar features.  I've been using it for two weeks.I've owned Vizio products before and I haven't had a single problem with them.There are a lot of the connectors are on the left side of the TV.  This was a little bit of a problem for me because all of the things I want to connect to it are on the right side of the TV.  I just needed to use longer cables, not much of an issue.I connected a coaxial antennae to the TV, scanned the channels and was watching OTA HD in minutes.I connected to the internet through WIFI setup was painless and easy!  Ethernet cable connection is plug and play.The SMART TV functionality is nice. A lot of the same features (Amazon instant video, netflix, etc) can also be done with my XBOX360, but I'd rather only have one device on (instead of two).  This TV is very low power so it doesn't heat up my room as much as my old LCD tv + XBOX360.Now onto the TVs display.Out of the box, the TV didn't need any tuning at first glance.  I was watching a college football game (Georgia bull dogs vs Clemson Tigers)  You could tell the difference easily between the Deep red of Georgia and the deep orange of Clemson.  I was in a sports bar watching a replay of the game and you couldn't tell the difference.  Big points for out of the box tuning.This TV has some really deep blacks.  It's especially noticeable when the screen goes dark between scene transitions in a movie.  If the TV is the only source of light in the room, the room will go pitch dark.All in all, it's a good buy.

The second one, while better, it will always power off and not lock up, it still has issues when powering up. After you turn it off, if you try to turn it back on too quick, it won't power up. We have to wait several minutes to able to get it to power up. On top of that, sometimes when it powers up, the logo is not display and no picture is displayed for more than a minute. It looks like the the TV is locked up but EVENTUALLY it will come around and finally display video and unfreeze itself. Other times it will display the logo and power up and display video within about 5-10 seconds. The other thing I noticed is the setup menu is completely inaccessible for several minutes after the TV powers on. I press the button or select the smart bar option to open it and nothing happens. Then eventually several minutes later, out of the blue the setup menu will appear. Again, this is my second one, so it has become extremely frustrating.The picture itself is very nice once you get the settings right. I found a CNet post recommending setting for this and they worked well. I do feel the viewing angles aren't all that great. Moving off center, the contrast changes become noticeable. Overall tho, I am happy with the picture.On the smart TV side, I like that they have just about all the major ones, including news apps for a couple of my local stations, which is cool. However, they don't have MLB.TV or NHL Gamecenter. The Amazon app leaves a lot to me desired too since it never starts a full screen app, leaving you to navigate thru pages and pages of movies in a 1 quarter screen sized window. Plus on the Prime side, you do NOT have access to your watchlist. All you get is a list of top movies and top TV shows to browse thru. The Netflix interface is nice but viewing stuff is buggy.

Picture was nice to look at.  But what good is it to have a TV that does not respond when buttons are pushed on its remote and this happened to two different Vizio TV's?  My review is for this TV though and this merchant.  TV was advertised as brand new and it was not!  It was used and I could see that as I started unwrapping it.  I thought about returning it, but what a hassle and had to think about it again for a few days.  But the more I used it the more I didn't like it and seeing that the remote had scrathces on it and so did the TV has a scuff mark on the front of it that I could only see, in the light of day.  I had waited several weeks for this TV to be delievered because the seller said they did not have the color I ordered and would have to order it, I said \" Ok, because I want the black color I had ordered.\"  What a sham!  Since they sent me a used TV, anyway!  When I got another Vizio, just like the first one.  I could see the difference in quality of the second remote.  Very shinny and prestine right out of its wrappings and so was the second TV very prestine condition and shinny.  So my observations wer correct.  However, both remotes needed to be pressed many times to get them to respond and sometimes the screen froze up.  So I decided to return both of them.  The first one back to the seller at Amazon and the second TV that I had purchased locally, in my area.  I had no problem returning either of them and received my refund w/o a hassle.  But I will never buy from that seller at Amazon, again.  I believe, they must have thought that I would not return their TV, since I had waited so long for it to arrived.  But they were so wrong.  If for not anything else,...it was for the principle of the whole situation. I do not like being made out to be a foolish consumer, because I am not.  I pay close attention to details.

We have a traditional colonial style house with period furniture and it needed to fit into a wooden cabinet with doors. The 29\" was a perfect fit with just a 1/2 clearance on each side. We use it to watch Over the Air Broadcast TV and the receiver pulls in all the stations we ever got on our old analog TV with Digital convertor box. The image is bright and sharp although I had to select Gaming Mode to get the level of brightness and contrast that looked good. But here are the pitfalls:1) The stand is cheap and makes the TV lean backwards at an awful angle. It just does not look good tipped back that way. What were the designers thinking of? I thought I could simply prop up the stand on a couple of boards (you can't see them in the cabinet) but then the whole thing was tippy and risked falling forward out of the furniture. I ended up using wire zip ties stapled to the boards and clinched around the base to hold the whole thing in line.2) The TV Guide function for Broadcast TV is terrible. You can only see the current show. This means you can't sit down in the evening and peruse all the upcoming shows and plan your entertainment for the night. Since this information is being broadcast anyway I simply don't understand why the programming for the set did not allow you to see the entire nights line up! The only solution is to move to another TV, check out all the listing and then return to this one. Hardly a good work around. C'mon Vizio!3) The USB port and headphone/audio out jacks are on the back side. When the TV is in the cabinet they are inaccessible. I like to use a nice set of headphones to listen to my favorite shows or movies that my wife is not interested in. I thought I could work around the headphone jack issue by buying an extender cable but learned to my dismay that as soon as it was plugged into the back of the TV the speakers were cut off. No work around for that one either.

It's replacing an old 19\" RCA tube-style TV that's worked great for nearly 30 years, has great near-HiFi sound, BUT looked very dated in this time of flat-screens.Well, the new Vizio works great as a replacement TV of about the right size, and has good color and resolution...very happy with the picture.  BUT the sound is no where near a good as our previous 1980s TV.  With its tiny speakers, the VIZIO sounds tinny...like listening to the news through a tin can and sting.  The VISIO TV's audio controls include a frequency equalizer, and after tweaking them, I think it helped a bit, but the end result still irritates me continually when listening.  I'm now looking to replace the TV if I can find one with better sound.  We don't have room for an additional sound bar etc...we want the speakers in the TV. BTW...the TV is hooked up via an HDMI splitter to our cable box, along with our Sony big-screen living-room TV (which sounds great), so the audio is digital, directly from the cable box, which also does the channel selection.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "owned for 6 months", "Author": "Daniel Horande \"Daniel Horande\"", "ReviewID": "R270L5NGJPL7DC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far so good..

Unless the TV is at eye level or tilted perfectly in your direction (which is tricky since the stand has a tilted design) you can't enjoy the images.  The colors get lost...almost like the screen has a privacy cover.  Additionally, the backlight glows around the screen's edges.  This becomes apparent when watching movies in the dark.The apps and wireless connection work great...and I like the remote's buttons that launch Netflix and Amazon Prime with one click.

Demaya \"Modsurfr75\"", "ReviewID": "R3OJL26NIL8T6E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture is pretty GOOD. I'm not going to say great but it's pretty good for the price. I did some extensive homework before I bought this as I was looking for a smart tv that offered an alternative to hooking it up to several components for a guest bedroom. Instead I liked it so much that I ended up putting this in my bedroom and switching it out with a slightly older Sylvania flat screen I had (great picture) for the guest room. The slim, sleekness of it takes a little getting used to in terms of the screen- you have a thinner frame and more screen to look at if that makes sense. The apps and streaming are pretty good for what you get and Vizio is constantly updating to add more apps. There is a slight learning curve when trying to link it up with your wifi however I found that by turning it off & on after the initial info is entered helped in terms of getting the tv to connect. It took two tries for me but afterwards it was smooth sailing. Again the Netflix, Hulu and other apps are good. There's some interesting freebie channel apps where you can watch old tv shows in there too at no cost so that's kind of nice to have. My favorite feature of this television hands down is the ability to plug in a usb drive and play multiple types of video files automatically without having to hook it up to a PC or DVD player. You can also play mp3 files and look at photos, etc. but I was really impressed by the number of files it would play without too much of a problem. The remote that comes with the TV is a sore spot here and I'll tell you why. They provide you with a smart tv that allows you to access online streaming and other applications yet you get this remote that is more for a basic TV with no buttons such as for launching Netflix or other hotkeys for the streaming apps it offers. This is where Vizio literally Cheapens out this model. The remote is also small, lengthy and complicated in terms of a million tiny keys. There is also no keyboard. You would think that a smart tv would come equipped with a remote that offered a keyboard yet it does not. I realized this is part of the reason why this tv is a bit of a bargain compared to other smart TVs out there. At any rate, I resolved this by replacing the remote with the VIZIO XRV1TV Qwerty keyboard remote (bought here on Amazon for about $12). I know this is not ideal for some because the idea is that you get a brand new tv and you shouldn't have to spend extra $$ on an additional remote however I recommend it in this case as the little cheap universal that comes with this set will drive you mad. You really do want a remote with a Qwerty Keyboard on the back as this will come in handy if/when you do a search on youtube or Netflix or Hulu--you won't be there forever trying to navigate letters on-screen with the up/down remote toggle keys (eyes rolling). Now for the rest of this thing- it's got great picture and some pretty good choice settings for gaming, etc. You just have to get in there and explore it. Some people have complained that the picture looks dimmer than when they saw it on the showroom floor however I just found that I adjusted the controls and it seems to be fine. I believe also that this set has an automatic sensor built-in that adjusts the brightness of the screen depending on the level of light in the room. I have not played with it enough to find out for sure whether or not this is something you can turn off or adjust. There are only two HDMI connections and that can be bothersome to some. For me this wasn't an issue as I don't always hook this up to a PC however it was good to have it hooked up to my cable box but honestly two connections was fine for me. Gamers and PC enthusiasts may get irritated at this small amount of HDMI connections so buyer beware there. Again, this was one of the cheapest smart tv models out there with good reviews that I found so i'm not too surprised it lacks a few things. Some folks have complained at the slowness of the TV to power on and I will say it takes about 20-30 seconds which can get on your nerves. All I can say there is to just have some patience and resist the urge to keep hitting the power switch as I learned the hard way you might actually activate a hard-reset of the television by doing that. That brings me to mention a safety feature the tv has built-in in the event of a power surge or storm. I came home one evening after a wicked rain storm to find the tv buzzing at me every few seconds after I'd turned it on. It kept making a noise similar to those you hear when a weather bulletin flashes on your screen from your local news, etc. I couldn't get the TV to stop doing this so after trying to adjust the settings for a good half hour and finding no solution to this I did some research on the net and found this was a result of a built in sensor that is designed to protect the TV from shorting out if an electrical surge occurs (which apparently did). So the solution to this was to power it off and unplug it from the power source for a good 20 minutes. Once we did this, it came right back on and adjusted to normal as if nothing had happened.

The TV is quite easy to use for the 5 year old, while I keep the remote to myself for the 3 year old.  They love the integrated Netflix.  I wish Amazon Prime had a better app, but I'm not entirely sure who is more at fault in that departments, Amazon or Vizio.  While Netflix will automatically play the next episode in a series, Amazon Prime is quite an ordeal to back up from the currently selected video, select the next episode in the series, then press a button on screen to play the video.  This sounds trivial, but the menu and buttons are pretty convoluted in my opinion, and the default focus from one screen to the next is terrible.  The Play button is never focused on after selecting a video you always have to press down to change the focus to that button.  That's a lot of griping about something that isn't necessarily related to the TV but worth noting for prospective buyers, in my opinion.  I wouldn't trade the TV in or anything, but when I'm next in the market if I heard that a specific TV had a better experience it would weigh on my decision.Aside from all that, the picture is excellent, the integrated speakers are clear and strong (for integrated speakers), and the remote is easy enough to use.  Those are my most significant demands from a sub $250 TV.  I should note that I wall mounted these TVs about six feet up to prevent the TVs being damaged in anyway, grubby hands or accidentally being knocked over.  This really makes the remote easier to use since it's effectively overhead.I need to mess with the DLNA though my expectations are low.  I have Synology NAS with a DLNA server application that I need to test out.

I know some reviewers like not having the TV mounted on a pedestal, but I find that the back brace \"stand\" is somewhat unstable. It also forces the screen itself to point slightly upward.  I am probably going to need to buy something to elevate the TV half a foot or so above the table top it sits on since I didn't anticipate not having that extra 6\" that a pedestal stand would have given me.  I did find a couple of inexpensive table top stands for small flat screens, but the ones that mount the TV to vertical rails are probably out of the question since directly below the mounting screw holes in the TV are the HDMI and component video inputs. These sockets would be blocked by the rails.Then there is the sound.  In a word, awful. It sounds as bad as any tinny set of PC speakers built into a 20\" monitor.Finally (and this is minor I'll admit) is the time it takes the TV to start showing broadcast TV when it is first turned on (at least 15 seconds) and the time it takes to display the previous channel when switching back and forth (around 3 seconds).", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Another Great Vizio", "Author": "GrapevineGrammie", "ReviewID": "R1JCRRE7G1Q1P1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our family has 10 vizio's of different sizes among us (3 families) and no disappointments yet.

I've been pretty happy with my purchase. There a few things I don't like, but overall, it is a pretty good bargain. For less than $200 I was able to get an HD TV that has built in Netflix and Amazon Prime. This saved me having to buy a Roku or similar device just for these two features. The quality of the picture I get with Netflix is excellent. The quality of the picture I get with my Dish Network receiver is not quite so good, but then again, my Dish receiver set up remotely to the primary tv and only the first tv gets HD, the second is in SD, which is a whole separate issue. I'd have to add a Hopper to get HD on the second set. The screen size for normal viewing is not 24\" and while you can select three other settings, I find this feature really annoying. I leave it in the \"normal\" viewing size because the \"wide\" \"panoramic\" and \"zoom\" settings add slight distortions to the picture. Netflix comes up in full screen size, so I'm really not sure what the deal is with that. The other thing I'm not too crazy about is the matte finish (versus glossy) picture screen. I thought I might like it, but when I compare it to my Samsung 50\" I realize that I guess I really do prefer a glossy picture. However, the bottom line is that I still feel like it was a good deal for the money. I really didn't want to spend more for a second tv that gets limited use anyway.

It was also left on my porch without me signing for it and with a picture of a TV showing it was soooo fortunate it wasn't stolen. the store clerk also said I should call you and request I sign for it. You have NO contact phone so again I had to wait for another to be mailed and stay home all day to make sure it was not stolen.

For $100-200 more, you can easily get a much better non-smart TV and a BluRay w/wifi or a Nintendo Wii to play Netflix/Amazon.I know this is only 720p and that it's a low model, but it shouldn't be this difficult to get a decent picture for 250 bucks.  Blacks are often gray, and in dark movie scenes, it's as if someone is shining a flashlight from the top & bottom of the screen.  My family has fiddled with all options (except \"backlight\"--see below), and though we managed to get an OK picture, there's a milky, light-flooded quality that just can't be overcome.  We also tried the calibration suggested by a previous 5-star review, but the picture actually seems worse than what we managed to get!BACKLIGHT OPTIONEven after turning \"backlight control\" from \"off,\" the TV would not allow for adusting the backlight, which is frozen.  Even if I'm missing something here, it shouldn't be so difficult to figure out how to adjust this.  Some may call me tech illiterate (though I'd disagree).  But assuming that's true, if the whole purpose of not permitting us to adjust the backlight is so that the tech-illiterate won't accidentally distort the image, then the default should be such that the image is acceptable to us imbeciles.LOAD TIMEAnother minor flaw is that the load times are quite slow for apps and even for the monitor's boot-up.  Netflix sometimes takes 20 seconds, and it's hard to tell whether the app is actually loading or not.  TV boot-up time varies.  My advice: don't let this be the deciding factor.SOME PROSThe smart app buttons on the TV are convenient, but I attribute this more to the convenience of smart tvs as a whole and less to this particular incarnation.  The sharpness of the image is not bad.  My issues with the picture concern the light, not the sharpness.  Obviously, if you're looking for true HD, you should be looking for 1080 (so this is not a factor in my low rating).OVERALL--PAY MORE FOR SOMETHING BETTERThis TV has caused a lot of headache for a family that wasn't looking for perfection.  I'm giving it 2 stars not because it's unbearable but because I value my time, and it wasn't worth the time dealing with the picture.  It'd be OK in a dorm or if you want cheap smart tv functions for occasional wifi streaming.  If you're a TV expert, maybe you can figure out the calibrations quickly or point out the errors of my actions (which I would welcome!), but most of us aren't wanting a course on television functions. We just want a nice picture, which we should get for this price point.  My advice: upgrade.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "E390i-A1 Review", "Author": "Cygnus X-1", "ReviewID": "R2L1XGZP0Q6ZXQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not a bad TV but not a great TV. I bought this for my son for Xmas and I spent a lot of time setting it up and playing with it.I waited until it was less than $400 here on Amazon which is a decent price. Sometimes it's a lot higher than that and the TV is not worth it.Some good things:The picture is good, really sharp. The sound is OK. There are a ton of adjustments so you can spend a lot of time playing with it. There are plenty of inputs and you can actually give each source it's own custom name which is nice. Each source can also have it's own mode settings (example, Game Mode for the Wii U input). Setting up the ethernet connection was simple. I use a wire though, not wireless. The web apps are cool, once you get them to load. Youtube works great once it loads. The TV is ultra light so it's easy to setup or move.Some bad things:The web apps are slow to load and the TV quite often locks up. That's really annoying and you have to turn it off to reboot it. You can't upgrade the firmware manually, I guess it's done automatically. Once the apps load though they seem to work well. Also, mine had a weird effect where the screen would slowly brighten then dim then brighten then dim etc. I thought it was a defect but turning off the Smart Dimming feature solved it. That feature is defaulted to \"ON\" which doesn't make sense since it's annoying.I hope they update the firmware soon to make the apps load faster and quit locking up. I question whether I should have paid the extra for the Smart features and instead just went for a basic Samsung TV?

Also, set the color temperature to \"computer\". FYI, it takes about 20 seconds to connect to your cable box (may be the cable box and nothing to do with the TV) before the picture appears.

This TV looks nothing like the pictures shown!", "Author": "Alexander Boudreau", "ReviewID": "R28B6FQ0JW2X0S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV a few days after Christmas. I was looking for a slightly bigger TV then the one I had and this one seemed perfect. Due to the pictures on the website I was lead to believe all the HDMI ports were all on the side and that it had a stereo audio out port for a 3.5 mm audio device (headphones or the cord similar to the end of headphones). As I opened the product and began to hook it up I noticed that the side of the TV looked nothing like what was pictured. Only one HDMI port was on the side, the other was on the bottom. Also there was no stereo audio out only an optical and a red and white left and right audio out. The TV you receive when you order this product looks like the pictures shown on the VIZIO E320-B0E 32-Inch model. I was not happy since I have computer speakers and a subwoofer that were now not compatible with this TV because they had a 3.5 mm cord and the TV does not have one as shown on the website. I called Amazon and they kindly shipped me a new one that came in 2 days. I was annoyed again to see that they had sent me the exact same model as the first one I received. Clearly VIZIO updated the model without updating their pictures of the device because if you look on the official website and the instruction manual that is given to you they do not match so beware. Other then that I really like the TV. The size is nice for my room, the picture is great and the Netflix ability is nice. Sound is not great, but I bought a VIZIO sound bar and connected it to the TV through the optical port and it sounds great. If you plan to buy this TV beware that the pictures look nothing like what is shown on the TV. If you want a more accurate picture of it look at the  VIZIO E320-B0E 32-Inch model because those pictures are what the TV you receive will look like!", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Happy with it thus far", "Author": "Sheila Kufert", "ReviewID": "RYE119FQZI0PW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had used the new TV for a week with a DVR.

Let's start of by noting that it is thin and relatively light. We were able to take it put of the box and place it on the stand with no trouble. When we powered it up, the tv led me through a guided setup, got it on the network, and registered the TV. I really liked this.The picture was excellent.  My mother in law, (it's her tv) noted how crisp and clear it was for her, and started to chuckle at how much detail it revealed of the local tv anchors.  I was impressed at how bright the tv was.  We both very much liked the on screen controls. She particularly liked the ability to label the inputs with user friendly names (Cable, Roku, Blu Ray) which had bedeviled her on her older tv.  The remote was friendly, and the tv played nice with her Verizon Fios cable box.The only minor criticism I have is the wireless seemed a bit flaky.  I could not get the Amazon app to load. This wasn't a big deal, and is something we will play with over time.  She generally prefers the Roku box and we didn't dwell on troubleshooting.The four hdmi ports are generous.  I was a little iffy about having two on the side, but was pleasantly surprised how well positioned they were and hid the hdmi cable I plugged into port 3.Overall, a gorgeous picture, relatively light weight, small bezel came together in a great package.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a bad purchase", "Author": "E.

The reason I went with this TV is the internet apps.  We use Pandora, netflix and Hulu and there are tons and tons of other apps and even games.The 2 negatives I have are the speaker and the remote.  The speaker is pretty cheap.  Don't expect movie theater sound quality out of the speakers.  You could get a sound bar as a alternative. The remote works fine, but the buttons feel cheap.  No big deal.  I do wish you could program special buttons. Example:  There is a button on the remote for Netflix and it takes you to netflix, but if you want to go directly in to pandora, there is no button and you can't program one of the buttons for pandora.  Again, not a big deal, but would be a nice to have feature.So if you are looking for a decent TV with a ton of internet options, this is a great buy.  Would be great for a kids room or a workout room or even in a dorm room.

The picture quality is quite good, the size and weight are just perfect for our use (bed room unit). We especially like the capability to download movies via Amazon or Netflix. I would add that the navigation for these internet sites is a bit clumsy when searching titles and is in part due to the limited smarts of the TV/remote and the sites. We have not hooked up \"hard wire\"  to the internet yet and as a result the picture quality is a bit lacking. Hoping for a better level via a hard wire option which we will do soon. Sound level/quality is quite acceptable,  My biggest negative is the remote. It is too small for one handed operation. Button pushing, especially the extensions of the channel, e.g. 12.1, is really has to be managed two handed to make consistent changes. One other complaint and \"it is a start up out of the box issue\". Your instructions for the TV are embedded in the software stored on the TV. There is just a short leaflet to get you started. So when you bring the unit up if it doesn't default to the right/logical point you are stuck. I had to call the hot line for help. They don't even tell you there is an ON/OF button on the TV. I had to unplug the unit for 30 seconds from the wall, shut the power off (it is in a very inconspicuous place).and then reverse the process to get back to the correct default screen.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Research wifi issues with smart tv's.

I can't get the stand to be completely level though and the tv is tilting slightly to the right.  No one else seems to be bothered by this though. One suggestion for anyone looking to buy this tv though... Set up with a hdmi (hmdi?) cable would be much easier.  It's worth buying it at the same time.  I'll be stopping off to pick one up on my way home tomorrow. I'm also going to be looking for a Visio all in one remote so I can control the cable box and still access the Visio features. Not sure if the make one though. I have to say the SMART thing might be over rated.  I'll have to play with it more though.

People often talk about the speakers on these thin televisions and how they're \"too quiet\" but I've never had to turn it up past 30/100 (I usually keep it around 15-20).The most interesting feature I found was that each input stores it's own settings.

The \"smart\" part is less impressive.  I have used Roku to stream video for a few years and pretty much expected the apps to work in a similar fashion.  The Netflix app goes to a full screen and you navigate it the same way you would on a Roku device.  The Amazon Prime app is absolutely terrible.  The whole selection screen occupies only the left part of the screen and there is no way I can find to browse any categories other than Movies.  You see about 12 at a time and you have to scroll down to select or move to the next screen.  Another 12 possibilities.

Read on a forum that it needed a firware upgrade from Vizio. After that, all is working just fine. Adjusted the picture controls to my taste and all seems to be smooth. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is Vizio cheap 1 year warrenty. It forces you to think that if they really are behind the product why not 2 or 3 years. I could take 2 year parts and 1 year labor.P.S. Needed a simple remote to keep the kids out of the Smart TV content.

But alas, this is what happened on the 32\" Vizio I bought.  I have an older 55\" Vizio downstairs which has been great for about two years now.  When our upstairs tv died, I thought this would be a great option because of it's built in wireless networking.The tv installed easily and I was able to have it up on the wall in a few minutes.  It used the same screws that my other tv used.  I had it on and running quickly.  I did wish that its hdmi inputs were all on the bottom (one was on the left side and one on bottom) but it was working just fine.  Picture was nice and the wireless link was easy to install.  I did wish it would allow for push button network connection rather than having to type in the long password which was frustrating on the remote.  However, the networking started right up and we could watch Amazon and Netflix streaming easily.Fast forward, six days later and the backlight failed.  No more picture.  Just audio.  After reading some more reviews, this appears to be a somewhat known problem with some of the Vizio's.  So, the tv is already back on its way to Amazon.  The tv would have been a keeper if it would have kept working.  However, the reviews stating that Vizio is aware of this problem due to a bad batch of chips was enough for me to spend the extra and get a Samsung Smart tv.

In the end, after connecting another cable and disconnecting the coaxial cable, it worked perfectly from then on - coincidental?.. I don't know.

Even from a slight angle, the picture is outstanding, (with all the manufacturers settings..we actually haven't changed them, although I notice the saturation could be turned down a bit). We plan on possibly adding a soundbar or surround sound in the future, but even the speakers on this TV are pretty good. We have a PS3 and haven't really used the smartTV functions, although we have plugged in a flash drive to look at pictures, and the menus were easy to navigate.

Accessing Amazon, Netflix, and M-Go is extremely easy with this TV; there is a button across the top of the remote for each.  One simply has to push the button and search for the video/topic one wants.The remote control is fairly self-explanatory, but I do wish it had a QWERTY keyboard to make it easier and faster to use the \"Smart\" features of the television.  The on-screen keyboard is not difficult to use, but does take more time to use than would a QWERTY keyboard.Setting up this TV takes about five minutes because everything is easy to locate and access.  Plugging in the cable or antenna is easy (mine is a coax cable), and so is plugging in the HDMI cable for a DVD player.

This is by far the cheapest 47\" smart TV on the market! I was like most a little nervous about the apps, as that was the only reason i purchased this particular one. I read the picture needed adjustment, but to be honest I havent touched any screen settings and I think the picture quality out of the box is rather nice. I ran into an issue when it came to the apps though. Like many stated when you cut the tv on (which takes at least 20s to boot up) the apps are slow to pop up. I think it has to establish internet connection each time. After being on for a minute however it works just fine. My issue came when trying to watch a movie. Netflix worked great and loaded faster than i thought it would, but after 10min of viewing it froze and tried to reload and would just freeze. I thought it was just the internet and it was fine so I tried another app. Youtube worked fine and Hulu worked. Tried Netflix again and after 10min it did the same thing. I then tried a long youtube video and oddly enough it froze at 10min and the same with Hulu. So I called vizio and was excited to hear an american voice so that was a plus! After talking with them for an hour and trying multiple steps they still had no idea what was causing it. So we did a restart by holding the power button for 2min with the tv unplugged and on their end they did something with registering my tv on their server again.

Great price and the discount for Prime members was a real plus.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "A bit early, but . . .", "Author": "BobbyB", "ReviewID": "REGEH5I1M1OQU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this to replace a 42\" model I sent back when I realized this larger set would work in the space I had available.  I have only been using it for a few days; but so far everything seems AOK.  I have no immediate plans to use any of the internet-friendly features, so I cannot speak as to how they might perform.  I bought this item, primarily because I have other Vizio products that perform very well.I had no need to get a sound bar with this set, because it is hooked up to my home speaker system and has all the reinforcement it could ever need for sound.  That said, I was pleasantly surprised when without any help from my home speakers this set put out more sound than I ever imagined it might.  It's a bit thin on the low end, like every other set with skinny, elliptical down-facing speakers.  But it cranks out more sound than I need for my living room, so I give it 5 stars there.One feature I really like about Vizios is that in addition to the optical sound out, there are two RCA jacks for analog sound out.  Digital (optical) sound out is the highest quality; but I've never seen a set that has optical sound out \"variable\" along with the volume you choose for the set--even muting the set won't mute the volume going out optically, because it's essentially copied before it ever enters the set for processing.  So it's fixed at full volume out to whatever awaits it.Vizios (maybe others) allow selection of the analog out as either fixed or variable.  If you select \"variable\" for the analog out this means that any speakers (or headphones) hooked to that output will go up and down in volume along with the speakers on the set as you vary the set's volume.  And you can use both outputs simultaneously without diminishing the output from either one.I don't need that feature on this set due to its being in my living room; but I use it on  a smaller Vizio in my bedroom.  I have a Vizio sound bar that has separate remote adjustability for overall and bass volume.  That sound bar (with a separate subwoofer hooked to it) takes it's sound optically.  Then I use a couple of small, left-over, powered computer speakers (that face me, not down) driven by the \"variable\" analog out.  The computer speakers are directly below the set.  The sound bar is lower still, and the subwoofer is on the floor.  This combination, with some adjusting by program, really makes it seem like all the sound is coming directly from the set.  This is overkill for my bedroom but would work nicely in a living room much larger than mine, if needed.So, it's a bit early, but so far I'd really give a 4.5 for this one, maybe 5 later.  I just wish I had room for a bigger one.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Carey", "ReviewID": "R1OZD60VBHRDG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV works great.

I'll break it up into construction, picture, and user interface.The build quality seems to be good, and the thin edge is nice because there's not a whole lot of \"dead space\" on your wall.  One ding against it is that although is has enough space for about 4 USB ports, there's only one USB input on the TV.  It also looks like it's USB 2.0 and not 3.0.  Oh well, it's a small issue.  The stand is solid, though I have mine wall mounted.  There is an on indicator light that is useful without being glaring, and you can always turn it off if desired.  The remote is basic and does not have a qwerty keyboard, which IMO every smart TV should have.  Using arrow keys to select letters on an on-screen keypad is a pain.  I will probably order a vizio remote with a keyboard and see if it works with this TV.  The speakers have surprisingly good sound quality to my ears, though I am not very picky.Picture quality out of the box seems to be decent with the presets, though I'd still suggest you get a calibration disc at minimum to get the best picture quality out of it.  The screen is gloss finish, so glare can be an issue depending on outside light.  I can't personally tell the quality difference between this and a friend's sony, though I suppose it comes down to personal preference.A quick word on the 120hz issue - most inputs to your TV, such as blu-ray players, game consoles, and cable, will not put out more than 60hz to your TV (frames per second, if you will).  You can't display more detail than what comes from the source material.  So basically, 120hz might help reduce blur and judder (might), but it won't add any extra detail.  The only system currently able to push more than 60hz is a high-end PC, which depending on the graphics card and application can go way above 60.  In short, don't let hz be a deciding factor, especially as many movies and other things were meant to be seen at a slower refresh rate.  I would have gone with 60hz myself except that those were actually slightly more expensive than the 120hz TVs were.As to user interface, this is the one area where the budget side of the TV becomes noticeable.  It's a serviceable UI no doubt, but it lacks the same ease of use and speed that higher-end TVs have.  The app selection seems to be OK.  You can set up multiple users if desired, with passwords and avatars.  Settings and controls are generally easy enough to find.  The onscreen manual is useful, though I still wish a full paper manual was included.  Setup was simple and it found my wireless network with no issues.In summary, if you are looking for a good-quality TV at a reasonable price, this is a good way to go.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy set up", "Author": "Lynn", "ReviewID": "R3A028E93VTVV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV was so easy to install and set up.

I'm not spending money on a new HDTV that crops the image. In fact the older VIZIO that this model replaced for me also cropped the image.The audio is pretty good, though the speakers face straight down. I don't like the remote control, they flipped the channel/volume rocker position from my older VIZIO control (dumb) and the buttons all feel the same. There is scant instructions that come with this model so some features are a mystery, guess I have to go online to find a fuller manual.

It's not that noticeable, but it is there.-I finally found some color/picture calibration settings for the TV that I like after googling and finding some suggested calibration settings.

If that's really a \"problem\" with the TV, suggest watching less TV.Bottom line:  Great picture; for us, infinitely better than the 42\" plasma it replaced (and does not run nearly as hot as the plasma).

But I've owned other HDTV's before and the picture on this was absolutely beautiful.  My only reason for not giving it a 5 star is I was disappointed by how slow the apps operate and the lack of options on the apps themselves.  That might be because of the way the apps were written by their respective makers.  But for instance the amazon app doesn't let you sort through the free movies you pay for through PRIME by genre.  And Hulu Plus has very limited browsing options.  You can always do searches if you know the exact show you're looking for but the operations are clunky and slow and take a while to process.  While I understand it's not a cell phone its not very much data being transmitted to have a list of movies and a few pictures.  I can put up with some load times for high data HD movies but the awkward slow apps just can make it rather frustrating.  You can spend 30 minutes just looking for something to watch on an app and that's simply a waste of time.In spite of this I'd still give the T.V. a good rating.  It plays movies brilliantly and the sound is much better than you would expect.  The sound is great for average viewing and movies.  But for blockbuster large action films or intense sports I'm going to have to get a sound bar.

I bought it along with a vizio sound bar (reconditioned) for fifty dollars and an extra vizio universal remote to control the TV and sound bar (nine dollars).  So for a total outlay of about 350 I have a very satisfactory system with crisp video (720 is fine for 32 inch) and fine sound.  It took three minutes to connect to hte internet by WIFI and about the same time to set up the sound bar and link both to the universal remote.I don't see any other smart & soundbar combo at anywhere near this price point.A good package for frugal shoppersFEBRUARY UPDATE  After a couple of months' use I continue to think this is an excellent value.  Again, I recommend adding a (reconditioned) Vizio soundbar for about 50 bucks and getting a Vizio universal remote to control everything for about ten bucks.  The soundbar completely overcomes the complaints others have had about lackluster sound.  With the bar, faint conversation is crisp and clear and dramatic sountrack material and music are vivid and powerful.

I prefer the picture on the older non-led tv better - the colors seem more realistic and the viewing angle is better.  I guess that is thing with LED tv's - to me, the colors seem over saturated. and this tv out of the box, for some reason was calibrated with the blue turned up much too high but I love the energy efficiency of LED so I guess I can learn to love it.  after two software updates and a lot of tinkering with the color/contrast/brightness I did end up with a pleasing picture - however, the viewing angle is rather poor on this - when viewing from the side, it is still visible, but colors seem especially blue at that angle but i can live with it - my kids don't even notice it, so maybe i am just picky that way.  The best thing about this tv is the Smart function - the apps are great and responsive and it's wifi connectivity also works great connecting to a router one floor and several walls away.  Streaming via netflix, amazon instant and vudu is flawless - no stutters, no lags - i really couldn't ask for that part of it to be any better. MGo app says is still under development, but with netflix, amazon instant, vudu and pandora, I'm not sure it's even necessary. Overall, for this price I really like this tv and it's internet apps.

It's got a GREAT picture, but as many people have said, has a disappointing sound system.  This can easily be corrected by adding a sound board or hooking the set up through your current stereo system.The \"Smart\" TV is really a waste of money.  If you think you will have a web browser, YOU WON'T.  You must go through the apps listed on the TV.  But, there's another problem.  When using these apps, you go into a different part of the site.  For example on hulu, you can find a lot of old series that you can watch without charge through your computer.  But, when you use your app on the TV, you are prompted to join hulu and don't get access to any of the free stuff they offer.The same held true with YouTube.  When I went through my computer and put in a musician's name, over 100 videos came up to choose from.  But, when I entered the same info from the app on my TV, only 20 videos came up.This isn't the fault of the TV, I have to admit.  In a few years when technology catches up with itself, the smart feature may work better.  In the meantime, you get TONS more programming to watch by hooking this TV up to your computer instead.I need to replace another TV and I would absolutely buy a VIZIO again, but NOT with the SMART feature.  Save your money or use it more effectively by increasing the size of your screen or buying a good sound board, or even going with Roku (same problems but many more apps for less than you pay for the SMART feature.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Flawed by Design", "Author": "LisaRCT", "ReviewID": "R2SJNDTJIZHOQX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Called Vizio because TV could not connect to WiFi even though laptop, tablet and cell could connect fine.

I was eying the Samsung 22\" at a price point of about $177 (definitely don't buy it for over $200 if you're in the market) and I felt the reviews for the Vizio hit me harder, especially when I read about the matte screen.Some might not mind about reflection/glare off a TV set, especially for the bigger sets if you are well far away from the screen.  For smaller screens, I prefer not to see my face while I watch DVDs and the like!  If you stare into the Vizio 24\" screen you see kind of like a shadow of yourself, which is a lot more appealing to me.  The snap/screw on stand makes it so you can fit the TV just about anywhere, the sound quality is decent for its price point, and--one of my favorite things--the LED indicator light on the front turns OFF during use, which leaves nothing but you, the darkness, and the picture!One thing I want to throw out there for first time users, when you go to setup your TV and you get to the network password, press the OK button on your remote to get access to different characters like letters.  I had to search for that on the Internet because I was a bit puzzled at first.  The remote itself feels very cheap, but there are a lot of handy shortcut buttons despite the cheap, clicky feel (amazon, netflix, and m-go button on top).I have not and won't use this as an actual TV (a 55-incher is doing that job) but instead planned to use it as an optional computer monitor (HDMI), Netflix, and to play console video games (A/V input).  The TV has a VGA (the blue computer port) and HDMI input, and I'm waiting on the HDMI cord (the TV didn't come with any cords outside the power cord).  For the price point, this cord by Amazon seems to be the best: AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable  (25 feet/7.62 Meters)-Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard].  I also decided to buy this remote per a comment on the reviews for the Vizio line: New!

I'm really glad I did, because using the left/right keys is a chore, and I am looking forward to a QWERTY.So far all I have done has been Netflix (Nosferatu) and Anchorman (DVD using A/V).  Sound/video wise--for the price point--I'm very happy with the TV!Update 12/2013: Have the HDMI cord now and the TV works great as optional computer monitor.  The WiFi on the TV gives me up to 720 HD via Netflix, but my computer's network adapter is a bit more stable.  After some more use, everything seems to run fairly well.  Waiting on the QWERTY control now.Update #2 12/2013: Have the QWERTY now, as described earlier.  This remote is SO much better than the stock remote that comes with the 24\" Vizio!  The buttons do not click, everything is smooth, and the QWERTY on the back is great.  The only thing that is kind of tricky is opening the battery compartment, but you won't have to do that too often.  If you get the 24\" VIZIO I highly recommend you spend a little extra and get the New!

I'm coming from a 5 yr. old high end Samsung CCFL LCD for comparison.  The BF price was low but not worth the poor picture so I returned it.Out of the box, the calibration was way off.  Skin looked pink and green.  After some calibration, good blacks and colors vs. the old Samsung.  I wanted a new TV to get better blacks and this had it.  Turn off those horrible coloring and contrast shifting options - they change the picture consistency too much.  Colors: A-, Blacks: AThe Vizio looked slightly softer side by side - the old TV appeared to be a tiny bit sharper when pixel peeping.  Nothing too noticeable in casual viewing so not a big deal, I don't know why.  Appearance of sharpness: B+The bad: Backlight: F.  It was reasonably bright but it had some major issues: major vignetting, (dark shadows in the 4 corners) - if you go to the local big box store, you will see vignetting on some displays.  This effect can be fun on your instagram selfie, horrible on a TV.  This should be an auto F but there was more.This display also had a very inconsistent backlight.  I don't know how they make something so simple so bad.  My old TV has very consistent diffusing of the backlight and it uses old school CCFL lamps.  Backlit LED are supposed to have local dimming and no \"flashlight\" or clouding effect that some edge lit LED have.  It wasn't too noticeable during the day but during night, there was clearly a thin white glow at the very top, lighter vertical bands on the right side, and lighter cloudy areas on the left side.  On a black screen like credits, between commercials, or dark scenes, this was clearly visible.Motion blur: C.  Noticeable but it seems like most LCD at this price point are about the same.The base mount does not swivel but was sturdy enough.  No real problems there or with overall build quality.  It was a plastic shell-I judge on picture not the case.Sound is better than expected but not anything special, C+.  My old TV's speakers sounded like voices were coming out of a tin can.  These sounded way better but obviously not close to a soundbar.  Don't buy a flat screen expecting good sound so C is average for these.

I wanted a \"smart\" TV to eliminate multiple remote controls laying around (Roku & TV & Digital Conveter Box, old TV was a tube job). After much research, this Vizio is the only 32\" smart TV that would fit (barely). I prefer Samsung but their 32\" set is about an inch wider and would not fit the space. The only 32\" TV I found that is narrower is the JVC EMT32 and that is only about an eighth of an inch narrower and is not a smart TV. Dropping to a 29\" set would have been too small. We have had for several weeks now. Good picture quality. The speakers sound very tinny and annoying. Played with the audio settings several times, still can not get a decent sound from them. Too little bass and too much treble. Have wired into home stereo system with the RCA jacks and can play TV audio through that if we want and it sounds much better. The 720p picture is fine for this size set. I do not feel we are compromising there. As others state, the remote is small but I don't mind the size. What I do mind is that the buttons \"click\" when you push them. If you are channel surfing,this gets old. No need for an audible confirmation that I pushed the button. The wireless feature was not working well for us due to router about 30 feet away on a different floor in our home. Roku box had no issue at same distance. I have since run an ethernet cable from router through walls/ceiling to the TV directly and the Netflix streaming is fine now (no different than with the Roku wirelessly). Have added a few extra channels through the app store and they are fine (Mostly use Netflix but also Crackle).  I fired Verizon pay TV and we use antenna and streaming. The free TV via antenna is broadcast in hi-def 720 and 1080 by the major stations and looks great on this set.  Summary: Crappy speakers, noisy remote and weak wireless, everything else is fine. If flawless wireless performance is important to you, you might want to pass. Smart Apps working fine with a wired connection for us.I will update the review in a few months.*** 6 month update 12-7-2013 ***Nothing much to add since the original review. Daily use since purchased. I need to get a soundbar or external speakers. The tinny built in ones are lame. One other nitpick is that I feel this TV takes too long to come on. After you turn it on, it takes about 15-20 seconds or more before you have picture and sound.  Overall, still very happy with purchase and would buy again knowing what I know now.

The size is nice, the stand is sturdy, and the picture is great.The main thing I wanted was a TV with the ability to play videos directly from a USB thumb drive, and this does that perfectly. For the price, I expected the sound to be sub-par at best, but I'm actually very satisfied with it. An audiophile might prefer an external sound system, but the sound is perfect for my purposes.I can't comment on the smart TV features because I haven't used them and don't really plan on using them. I only went with this one over cheaper non-\"smart\" models because of the aforementioned video from USB feature.In short, if you're looking to upgrade from an older TV to something more modern without spending an arm and a leg, this is a great deal.UPDATE: I have found one feature that I wish it had... I wish there was a way to select the exact spot you want to start from in a movie/TV show, because it seems like the only way right now is to fast forward until you get to the spot you want, which can take a very long time with a movie.Maybe there's a way to do that and I just haven't figured it out yet, but it would be incredibly helpful.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good size TV for the money", "Author": "Shane H.", "ReviewID": "R20UEK7UBA5MZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for the bedroom.

In my experience it was HDMI ports 3 and 4.I decided I was going to figure out if it was the television or my \"electronic devices\"or possibly the HDMI cables. I decided to do this by connecting all my devices to HDMI ports 3 and 4 of the VIZIO tv as well as a 46\" inch SHARP television I already had in my house.

It seemed like a really great value.  It has four HDMI inputs, Ethernet, optical out, ARC, and apps, just to name a few features.  The 1080p and 120hz was exactly what I was looking for, and all for under five hundred dollars.  How did things turn out you may be asking\u2026Not well.  Not well at all.I thought I did my due diligence and researched this television thoroughly beforehand, but that was not the case.  This television got mixed reviews, and if you dig deep enough, it actually got horrible reviews.  Although it\u2019s not obvious, it\u2019s true.  Here are my issues:1. Picture quality is abysmal.  I tried adjusting all of the picture settings and was unable to get the picture to look satisfactory, let alone good.  The whites are washed out, there is very little contrast, and the most frustrating thing is the flickering backlight.  I played with all of the settings, and was unable to stop the backlight from flickering.  My seven year old Sharp Aquos looked better than this tv.  The picture actually changed several times during a tv show in one specific scene. Imaging you\u2019re watching a show which has an eight or nine minute scene, with the same camera angle, etc, this screen would change colors, quality, and would flicker constantly.  It was very aggravating and frustrating.  No setting or tweaking would fix this problem.  It\u2019s just plain bad.2. The audio output from the built in speakers is a complete joke.  If you don\u2019t have either a sound bar or an external receiver to route the audio through, you\u2019re going to be very disappointed.  How Vizio could let something leave their factory in this condition is beyond me.  It sounds like a broken public address system; absolutely horrible.  If you use a sound bar, it\u2019s ok.3. The boot-up time is ridiculous.  I can\u2019t believe how long it takes for this tv to power up.  I think it takes close to a minute.  That\u2019s unacceptable.  Again, my Sharp wasn\u2019t like that and it was a much older unit.  Even when it powers up, it still take another minute to fully come to life.  Amazing\u20264. For a \u201cSmart TV,\u201d it\u2019s pretty dumb.  First of all, the setup process was intrusive and time consuming.  I had to enter all types of information into the television to make use of the apps (which is ok I guess, but there was NO keyboard).  It would have been nice to have a qwerty keyboard on the remote instead of the one letter at a time point and scroll. [We\u2019ll get to the remote later]  After the lengthy setup process, I tried the apps.  First and foremost, the processor in this tv needs an upgrade.  There is significant lag time when selecting apps or scrolling between them.  It\u2019s really slow and Vizio should be ashamed.  The user interface is clumsy and disorganized, the apps are slow to respond, and when they do they oftentimes fail to load.  It\u2019s very strange.  It\u2019s as if no thought or planning went into the software design of this television \u2013 very disappointing.5. The remote\u2026Ah, the remote.  Garbage is the only word I have for it.  It is small, hard to read, inaccurate (meaning it\u2019s not powerful enough to transmit the signal on the first button push), and lacks quick keys for the sleep timer.  Although it has  a quick key for Amazon video, but since loading it fails almost all of the time, that\u2019s pretty much worthless.  The keys do not glow in the dark nor do they have a built-in backlight.  This was a big letdown.  It feels very cheap in the hand and it\u2019s really subpar considering what other manufacturers are providing.  It\u2019s a toy \u2013 nothing more.  I was shocked as how bad the remote was \u2013 I mean that\u2026It\u2019s a piece of garbage.I have sent this back and started my research all over again.  I will probably go with a Samsung; but I will do much more research this time.  My recommendation is the following:  Don\u2019t get lured into this television by the low price and feature set.  It\u2019s a complete hoax.  I don\u2019t say this stuff lightly, but we consumers need to know.  You will be disappointed.At the end of the day \u2013 you get what your pay for.  I went cheap on this tv and that\u2019s what I got\u2026A cheap tv.  Never again will I skimp on a television.  I am prepared to spend two to three times the amount now.  I guess Vizio is the best advertizing for Samsung and Sharp. They really make you appreciate quality products once you use theirs (Vizio).  Once again, don\u2019t waste your money and time on this tv.  Stay away from it.  Do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars and get something worthwhile.

The F-connector is the threaded nub onto which your coax cable is attached. This part should be secure and soldered to a circuit board.

I was excited to find that my logitech wireless keyboard worked in the USB slot!  So, if anyone is struggling with keying in WiFi passwords, or having trouble typing search terms in Netflix, plug in a keyboard.  I have a small logitech that I keep on the night stand next to my bed.The picture looks great.. I used to be a videophile, but this is just a bedroom TV.. so I'm not fiddling with it too much.  The audio sounds a little thin to me... but  I may just be used to my livingroom setup with the 12\" subwoofer. ;)The menus on the TV are sluggish... at best.  It takes several seconds after pushing \"Netflix\" for the app to open up.  Pretty annoying, really.  You would think, after having smart TV's around for so long that someone would have improved on the interface of these things.  The menus seemed laid out for a larger TV, also.. some of the fonts are hard for me to read from 10' away.  I find myself squinting a lot.I was excited to find you can stream media to this thing via a media server on your PC!  Using Universal Media Server ([...]) or something similar, you can stream videos, photos, and music to this TV! Very cool.  Again.. the interface is sluggish... and it's hard to read file names from any significant distance.  Also.. it's finicky about what video codecs it wants to play.  It'll play .avi's just fine, it seems.. but will give me a codec error on some .mp4's but not others... so, I'll have to fiddle with it more to see what works and what doesn't.Overall, I'm happy with it.

The first thing I did was connect the tv to make sure netflix worked and messed around with the different smart options. The remote is very simple, it even has its own Netflix button which most Vizio remotes have. So i watched a movie on Netflix with action, I chose \"Expendables 2\" The quality wasnt as great as I hoped. So I popped in a blu ray and started watching, and the picture was great. Clear cut lines and good sound quality as well. I put two and two together and realized that the Netflix quality picture wasnt due to the TV but Netflix.

The Vizio E241i-A1 24-inch 1080p tv has a much sharper, brighter, and more colorful picture than the old Magnavox, the HDMI input allows for 1080p viewing of Directv channels, and the smart applications connect wirelessly to all our favorite apps including Amazon Prime and Netflix.Would have given this tv a 5 star rating but there are two major drawbacks.  1) I'm concerned the stand is somewhat unstable and a little bump may send the tv face forward off the counter and onto the floor.  Took some clear packing tape to secure the stand to the Directv box on which it sites.  2) The wireless capability appears to be somewhat weak.  While watching a movie or show via Amazon Prime or Netflix, it tends to buffer to the extent it becomes a little annoying.  The wireless router is on one end of the house and the tv sits in the kitchen smack dab in the middle of the house.  We have a Roku HD on the complete opposite side of the house to the router and it never buffers.  We certainly don't live in a mansion so the connectivity issue is somewhat disappointing.Another note.  The first Vizion I received had a stuck pixel.  I called Amazon technical support and was told to run pixel fixer from YouTube.  I ran it twice for a total of 18 hours but the pixel remained stuck (glowed continuous green).  Went online to find other helpful tips (rub it with a warm washcloth, tap it lightly) but nothing worked.  Called Amazon back and they had a replacement in the mail the same day with 1-day air delivery.  This tv is perfect with zero stuck pixels.

Because I have Amazon Prime - I am making the most of it and this purchase was a long-time coming. As other reviews state, this television is a Smart TV and that enables me to connect to Amazon Prime streaming video, You Tube, Facebook, and a few other online sites.  Ultimately I chose this TV over a few others because the others did not have the Amazon access.Set up was SUPER EASY.  I did it myself and needed little more than a box cutter (to open the box) and a phillips head screwdriver. It took two minutes to connect the base to the bottom of the television. I already had my HDMI cables (but if you do not have any - these are a must for any new TV you purchase).  I hooked up my blue ray player, cable and ethernet and that was it.As is my style, I do not read instructions, but that is okay because this Smart TV was pretty easy to figure out.  We have been able to watch our You Tube playlists and favorites, take a look at Facebook, access Amazon Prime streaming video, access other web media and videos and watch TV (of course!).We had a 720 dpi LED/LCD Sony Television that we purchased a few years ago and that was our only main screen TV in the house.  The quality was fine for our needs but we wanted to put a TV in the playroom for the kids so we were due for a new one.  This TV is amazing in picture quality.  There is a noticeable difference in the picture when we access HD stations.  It is so crystal clear and sharp.  I find myself watching not so interesting shows just because the picture is so good!  The cool thing too is that the footprint of this TV is no bigger than our 31\" was... it just has a smaller frame around the screen.  It almost looks smaller than our 31\" Sony (or maybe 32\").I am extremely happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this TV to everyone.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vizio's low-tech model", "Author": "Lucien \"Luke\" Tarderon \"Luke Tarderon\"", "ReviewID": "RN5V9IWG3N6XL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is sa decent model.

It is very lightweight, which can be problem with tipping if it is grabbed by a toddler or small child (pet perhaps).

Overall, it's not as crisp as some of the more expensive versions, but works exceptionally well for the bedroom.Smart TV - this is one of the key reasons I bought the TV, to this end it is just OK.  I like the functionality of the banner method, but don't expect to be doing much surfing.  It works excellent for Amazon Prime, Pandora, Yahoo Weather, and other simple interfaces.  Overall, I'm pleased with this function but I'm not inspired to learn more about it based on the current method.Remote - basically the remote is marginal at best.  It has no lighting and it's easy to get the remote the wrong way in the dark.  It fails the bedroom test because of no lighting!  Sometimes it's a little hard to get the response from the remote, not sure if that is aiming problem or operator error, but still, it's a remote, it shouldn't be complicated.General - the TV is very, very, very, very, very, slow to turn on/boot up.  It's about like watching paint dry!  Of all the most annoying things, this one tops my wife's list of what she hates about this TV!  The TV is much more energy efficient than what it replaced and it can handle a couple HDMI's, 1 component, and a few other inputs.Overall, I really like the TV with all it's little shortcomings.Update after 3 months ownership!

Was kinda neat just plugging it into the wall and having Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, and Pandora right there ready to go. Took some time to enter all the required login/account information using the remote and onscreen keyboard, but that' wasn't really surprising.WHAT WAS SURPRISING is that the TV does not have a standard web browser OF ANY KIND. I'm not the only one who has complained about this. The TV's apps are provided through the Yahoo Connected TV Store. Yahoo claims that because using the onscreen keyboard and remote is such a lousy experience for surfing the web, they did not build a browser app. They apparently have no intention of ever doing so. Yeah, I understand their reasoning, I just disagree. I personally would have bought a different TV if I had known it didn't have a browser. I know I must be living the past here, but THAT WAS A BIG FEATURE I REALLY EXPECTED and I am VERY DISAPPOINTED it doesn't have it. Of course, in my case I had specific plans to use the TV for general web content in a business setting. A simple bookmark feature in the browser would have solved any usability issues for me. The worst part to me is that it could still /easily/ have one, if Yahoo simply allowed me the choice to decide how lousy of an experience I was willing to endure to use a browser myself. My guess is that a general web browser doesn't fit with the marketing vision they have for their app store. That's just selfish.Otherwise, the TV's great. It has every type of connection *I* can imagine. The picture is sharp, the sound is good, the onscreen controls complete. It works just fine for a piece of entertainment equipment at home. I'm still looking for the TV I need for the office, but at least now I know to dig a little deeper into where the apps come from, and that Yahoo is a giant red flag.

The picture quality is ok, but is no where near what my XVT was.  I am looking into finding someone to repair my XVT, but everyone tells me it will cost too much.  So, if this is your first LED tv I think you will like it, but for me it was a let down.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "SmartTV Glitch", "Author": "tipstir \"My Professional Review\"", "ReviewID": "R2RU24I5VWGCZT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had purchased this set this past week from BJS Wholesale. I had VIZIO 22-inch 2012 model in white no issues with that one. But let me tell you this one I didn't know it's their top of the line model for 24-inch LED/LCD HDTV with Smart TV.Getting this home and this was for the outdoor patio I have roof so it won't get wet. Mounted this on the masonry block using the stand sold here called: VideoSecu TV Wall Mount Articulating Arm Bracket for VESA 100 LCD LED Flat Panel Screen TV and Monitor ML10B 1E9.Now taking this out of the box and mounting using the 4x screws from VideoSecu works out just find. You have up to 30lbs weight of a HDTV that can be mounted. So techically speaking I could install the VIZIO 29-inch LED HDTV (this one is not 1080p) it's the old 720p which you don't want because when it comes to modern computers it will not display 1920x1080p. It will do 1080i @60hz but you can't do blue-ray and games that requires full HD.But just to let you know this set does, but quality of the image is poor, along the edges of the image being shown.Also I don't use CATV anymore so I have everything connected via two 40-mile HD-ANT (80-miles with two of them plus the ant joiner) also purchased here from Amazon called: RCA ANT751R Outdoor Antenna Optimized for Digital Reception.First scan of 70 channels and yes I have 70 channels they keep on adding more channels that you get from CATV non-premium ones. VIZIO does scan all the channels but it failed on two and added them as live stations. Those are analog and are not used. Compared this set to SONY, Element Electronics and Toshiba which don't add no working channels to the line-up.Once you get through loop, you have to setup the VIZIO WiFi is what I could only use because of where it was going. The set does have Ethernet port on the rear. You can't miss it huge impact on the box.What I've learned from VIZIO Customer Service Tech in SD, is the WiFi ANT used inside this HDTV is weak not as strong as it suppose to be. This is another reason why I had so much issues. My WiFi here I use the ESR600H sold on Amazon also. Strong signal WiFi Router used as AP (access point). It has 4x 5dBi ANT two external SMA removiable and two of them internally.  Plus this unit has high amp.VIZIO telling me the HDTV is not getting enough signal. The but the set is showing 5 bars and in the system info report shows the signal is 100%. The issue is the way the HDTV was first designed. They don't want you to use WPA2 they want you to leave it open, which doesn't make sense.Networking on this suppose to be easy for those who don't understand how everything works. But setting the set to DCHP by default where you should use Static IP address instead so it doesn't keep changing in the main router the IP address. Even if I do the correct way it still doesn't allow Amazon Prime Instant Videos to display or even load.The other issue is with Netflix after all the tweaking and clearing of memory and resets to factory defaults doesn't do really anything than it did prior.So if you hoping that WiFi going to work, you better search about this model before you decide to buy it or not.Final outcome from Netflix Customer Service Tech was that the VIZIO will not talk to our servers. He was right it will not and when it tries to I get that ERROR TVP-805. Always.Sound on this set sound like the first VIZIO Razor LED I had back in 2007/2008 was a nightmare. Last year was the first time trying them again on the Kitchen HDTV 22-inch. That one works. Why can't this VIZIO 24-inch do the same with Smart TV.Smart TV is based on Yahoo, so best you have that account. Your going to need it. Otherwise you'll be in Guest mode always.Of course you can remove the apps from the list, and just keep what you want. So many of them.  about 23 apps that needs to load. That's nothing I had updated the HDTV via internet yes, that works on this but only on certain apps via WiFi. Now how is that possible when I just said Amazon Prime Instant Videos and Netflix app didn't function right?I know, but again certain features work and some are not ready. Yes I have the latest firmware for 7/13. But let me tell you out of the box the update only was 18 apps. The set only did up to 23 apps after I had to reset it 4x times.I've tested a few apps to see how they work with my WiFi network setup. Vudu works, in HDX so this is real odd how some apps works and some don't. To watch Vudu in HDX you need a strong internet which I do have.Downloads 132 mbps and uploads 22 mbps. I own 8x SONY SMP (N100 and N200) these are network Media players which offers the features of what you have in a Smart TV but they allow you tap into your Windows 7/8 shared folders for Music, Pictures and Video. Where the VIZIO HDTV Smart TV doesn't give you that option. It's just are Internet Smart TV that's it!Youtube works also just to let you know, the quality in the imaging on this HDTV is not smooth  with the edges of the subject or object on the screen. That's now how it suppose to be unless the set is using Compressing to send smaller packets (data) through.What you get from the set is very sparse on inputs: 1 HDMI, 1 Component plus L/R Audio, 1 Composite L/R Audio, 1 Ethernet Port,  1 RF Coax - CATV/DTV, 1 15-pin VGA port PC, 1 Optical OutLast year VIZIO HDTV 22-inch White you get 2 HDMI all of the above except for the Ethernet port.The VIZIO 2013 this model the remote has all the features you need to control the set, but there is another remote for with more keys sold here on Amazon for $11 bucks. E241i-A1 - VIZIO XRV1TV Qwerty keyboard.Instead the box the PSU power code is very different you don't really see those types in a TV more in radio or small PSU. Also the cord is short too. Two AAA batteries, the stand (cheap plastic type) This was use in the VIZIO 22-inch had one just like it. The design of the 2012 model is better up front. Has curve at the bottom for the speakers. Thus this allowed me to mount it over my Microwave.This model doesn't give me that option to do that, it's larger, but again the size of the VIS = visual image size is smaller. VIZIO unless stated true 24-inch edge to edge. This model VIZIO E241i-A1 really 23.56\" and my VIZIO E220VA White 22-inch was 21.53\".Do be warn that the front of the set is busy with ID brand tags in grey over glossy black. White is also available seems more pure white than the E220VA White model I have in the kitchen right now seems off-white a bit, but the box read white on it.Also one more thing these sets are not high contrast using coated panel that gives off a shine to it or also called Ultra Bright Panel. Gives you the appearance of glass but not really glass. Without this features colors and dark areas won't be at their best.Need to go into a store that carries this model and test it out. Then get it off Amazon to save on the purchase.After all what was said I had returned this set for Toshiba 23L1350U which has 23/23-inch display so it's true 23-inch. E241i-A1 gives you 23.56 so you get .56-inch more.23L1350U, not a SmartTV Toshiba calls that CloudTV on certain models it offers it. I don't need that feature and already have 8x SONY SMP-N100/N200 here which doesn't give me the trouble with WiFi on the apps included Netflix, Amazon Instant Video an etc.. all play 100%.Yes E-Series 241i-A1 takes 8 seconds depends on your model but even in the store it didn't start up so quickly after the logo \"V\". Toshiba start quick after \"Toshiba\" red logo started. Both models are new built in 2013.Toshiba has 3-HDMI ports, 1080p LED Slim, full DTV Info Guide and Special Audio System EQ for more detail to sound quality really loud.I have it paired up with: Philips 5.1 Home theater 3D Blu-ray player HTS3541/F7 also sold here on Amazon. The audio sync up with the Toshiba meaning you turn up the volume and it points to the Philips when the Philips is managing audio surround.Again do test out what you buy first, if you can. If you don't need a (Smart TV (does require internet access) Wired or Wireless Router too. Cable or DSL modem. Smart TV features add more to the HDTV package, If that features doesn't work 100% then you'll end up like me returning it for a model that doesn't offer it.Good Luck!", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - Sound Quit After 20 Days Out of the Box!!!", "Author": "BayGirl", "ReviewID": "R30IN4Z15YMTHD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update:  My initial review was that this was an all right TV.  I've since changed my mind as it's not even been 3 weeks of VERY LIGHT use and the sound on my TV has stopped working.  All I have now is a wonderful clicking noise that I can turn the volume up or down to listen to, or can turn off the TV entirely and listen to it click.  To say I'm disappointed would be a gross understatement.  Vizio themselves were also a huge disappointment in that it's going to take at least 5 days for anyone to just *call* me to set up a time to get this repaired.Amazon has been great in standing behind their product offering either a refund or a replacement, but with this TV out of stock I'm looking at another month.  I am torn with getting this replaced as I've no confidence in their product whatsoever to actually be functional for any amount of time.Original review: So, I think this is a pretty decent TV.  Easy to connect to.  But the HD picture quality is not at all HD.  It looks like regular 720 to me.

But from day 1 the sound was messed up. I recently attempted to get it fixed through my Walmart warranty and the company deemed it unrepairable after a few repairs. So they gave me a reimbursement check for $700 and I purchased this TV.The reason I went with this tv over others was because I only had the $700 to spend and I needed a 3/4yr warranty plus I HAD to have streaming capabilities since my BluRay players capabilities were all messed up and I no longer subscribed to Xbox Gold. I had to have access to Netflix and Amazon.We originally purchased this off Walmart's website but it only had 14 reviews at the time. We unpacked it and plugged it in and set up couldn't have been easier. But right away we noticed that the colors were way off. Tried every different combo they had preinstalled and all looked like garbage. It was either too red or too dark. I fiddled with a ton of settings, finding different combos online for other Vizio TV's and nothing looked quite right.On top of that issue I noticed that the HD aspect of it wasn't as clear and \"soft\" as my Sony. I remember when I first plugged in my first HDTV (the Sony) and was blown away by how \"soft\" people's faces looked in HD. This TV does not have that. In fact, it almost looked grainy and pixely.I attempted to change the TV settings to that of my old TV. And it was almost impossible since they had completely different areas to adjust. But what I could do I tried and it looked horrible.What is amazing is our old tv was a 60hz LCD, and this is a 120hz LED and the old one was much better!Because of these issues, my husband is on his way to return the TV right now and exchange it for Vizio Vizio 47' LED 1080p 120Hz HDTV | M470VSE I really hope that one looks better!UPDATE 4/2/13: Returned this and got the new TV. The new one is a LOT better (although, sometimes the audio is out of sync). No major color issues like this one, and I was able to tweak it enough to my liking. The pixels don't look all screwy either. While I'm no professional TV person, I know what should be right with TVs, and this one was all wrong. Maybe I just got a bad one out of the bunch.

Picture is dim.Often I must turn the TV on & off, between 2 to 5 times, to get the brightness to work properly.I have tried changing remote batteries, using the TV power button itself, and doing a factory 'reset', which is all the help Vizio tech support offered.Also, the remote has a poor response.You often need to hit which button control 2 or 3 times before the set responds.You must aim the remote very carefully.They should place the sensor in the middle, or have 2 sensors, on each end of the TV.The remote itself has a cheap feel, and the battery lid easily pops off, with the slightest drop.It is also difficult to use the various settings to adjust the picture, and the Manual is not very helpful.The picture tends to be overly blue or purple, no matter how I try to adjust it.The picture is not all that bright and clear.The Power on light is difficult to see. I wish they had used a red or bright blue LED.Cable is difficult to screw on in the back of the TV.I'd like to find a Firmware update for this model, but Vizio has apparently not put out one.On the plus side, the HDTV was well packaged and arrived fast.And I do love that you can play Videos from a USB drive, directly on the Vizio.It is just an 'OK' HDTV, but I doubt I will buy another Vizio product again.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Visio TV", "Author": "James P.

If you want to design a room buy the vizio just dont turn it on. The sound is average and The smart Apps are okay but nothing to brag about. I purchased this TV at Dell for $599 to replace my 2yr old Sony EX700 and thought i was getting a great deal BIG MISTAKE.  The TV has a WIFI that has no on or off switch which means it will take up bandwidth in your house when the TV is on. I called Vizio and asked if there was a on off switch and the agent told me the only way i could turn off the WIFI was to reset to factory settings That was the first turn off. Next the picture clarity on the TV is average at best for a LED. The blacks are not dark and true and there is a constant blurr when watching. If i had to rate this TV on a scale of 1-10 my rating would be a 5. Bottom line if you do not want to spend alot of money on a TV the vizio is the way to go.

The TV was packaged in a box with 4 pieces of styrofoam on the corners and a thin covering over the whole TV itself. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETWEEN THE SCREEN AND BOX TO PROTECT THE SCREEN! This, however, is not the problem. I had insurance thru my freight forwarder to cover the cost of the TV, shipping, duty and port charges. I will be out nothing except for the next 60 days.The company was quick to try and solve my problem meaning I could ship the TV back to them and receive another. Shipping back is not an option as I'd be out another $200 for that. I told them I had insurance and would not be shipping the TV back to them but rather I had another request from them in good faith for the inconvenience I had suffered. I offered to buy another TV from them on the promise from them that the TV would be packaged properly so I wouldn't have to go thru this again and I'd have the TV I wanted.

(not sure if they still do).However, on this particular model, which I got from Costco, for $499 plus $35 tax, picture quality struck me as mediocre.Also,there seems to be a manufacturing defect: when I connect the co-axial receptacle on the Visio to the co-axial receptacle on my VCR (or on my cable box) I do not get any signal. Most users would just use one of the 3 HDMI ports. But in my case I want to connect my ancient but nice VCR to the Visio, using the co-ax connection.The install process was disgustingly difficult because I had to use the remote to type information, using the arrow keys on the remote to select each letter from an onscreen virtual keyboard. I actually developed a pain in my right hand doing this.Then I had a brainwave and plugged a regular USB keyboard into the USB port on the side of the TV and abracadabra, the install process became 99% easier.Suggestion to manufacturer:  Visio should include with the packaging materials the suggestion that to make the installation process super easy, the customer has the option of using a USB keyboard.On my prior Visio TV purchase, there was no install menuing at all. You just plugged things in, and it worked! But on this later model being reviewed here, you get extra bells and extra whistles via menuing, such as the labeling of each input, so that when you go to select which input to use, you do not see a rather unhelpful label like \"HDMI3\", and instead see the name of whatever device you have attached to the HDMI3 port: for example I have attached a Roku to HDMI3, and then used the keyboard to manually rename HDMI3 to Roku. And many other useful niceties.So anyway, I shall pack this beastie up, and return it to Costco.FEBRUARY 18: As temporary replacement of the TV reviewed above, I took from our bedroom a Visio VX32L, manufactured in 2006, and made an interesting discovery.That 7 year old set, a flat panel HD TV, gave very much better playback of old DVDs  than did the brand new E401 reviewed above, while using an 8 year old Sony DVD changer.

The reason I gave a low rating is that the Vizio TV I Replaced on the exact same cable connection, detected an entirely different range of digital channels and a variety of analog channels, which the VIZIO E320i-A0 did not.  It did not detect a single analog channel, whereas the previous TV on that cable did.  That is, the E320i-A0 failed to detect anything like the same channel lineup that the previous TV did, which is a VA26L, and the other two Vizio TVs in this house on the same cable also detect this same array. I reconnected the VA26DL and it and the other two TVs continue to operate on that same array of channels. Since all Vizio TVs have digital and analog tuners, I can only conclude that I had a defective unit. For what it's worth, from long experience I know that I must and I do torque the coaxial connection to a good secure fit, and the only difference in performance is the E320i-A0 TV.The Internet capability is of marginal use to me, as I have an Apple TV which gives me great flexibility.
