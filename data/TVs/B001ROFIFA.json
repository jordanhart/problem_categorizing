My cellphone has better speakers. It actually grates on my nerves to listen to this thing. And no matter how much adjusting for picture quality I did, the picture looked washed out and fuzzy. After 3 months of dealing with this cheap tv, I finally broke down and bought a Vizio. Best move I've ever made.
