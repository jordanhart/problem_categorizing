Velez", "ReviewID": "R264QIRRGCJOHM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After viewing all the available Plasma, LCD and LED in the 40 inch range in the big box stores for several weeks I kept walking back to the Phillips. Evidently they do not spend money in advertising and instead just provide a good product.  Very sharp. Excellent sound for a stock TV. The astonishing images at the store look even better at home. There is no reason to pay almost twice as much for another brand. A salesman at the \"Help Me\" big box store told me they had nothing that could touch it for that price.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not popular but excellent picture", "Author": "D. Mylrea", "ReviewID": "R3I3BGKPDXKODM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like the previous reviewer stated, you don't see this TV being pushed many places.  BUT, I too saw it as an open-box unit at our local Costco.  I went in initially for the Vizio 37\".  I looked at all the 37-42\" screens.  I went to the open-box section and found this Philips.  The screen looked amazing.  Sharp, clear, great colors, Back and forth between Vizio, and Philips.  Every time I went back to this Philips, I was amazed at the picture.  I figured if it looked this good at the store, it'd look even nicer in my house!  The price was a steal ($320 since it was open box), and I got the same return and warranty privileges (90 days return and 2 year warranty)...what do I have to lose?  No in-TV apps, but I can live with that. Three hundred bucks for a beautiful 40\" LED.  Sold!  The sound is nice and loud and although the remote is a bit basic, it doesn't matter as I have my DirecTv remote programmed for this TV too.Not sure if this model is even marketed many places, but if you stumble on one, check it out.  Philips (and LG-Philips) have always made some of the better looking LCD panels for computer monitors.  This TV carries on in that tradition.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008200IN4"}}
