{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great LED TV with some nice features", "Author": "A. Chang", "ReviewID": "R2UYIBYZ988A0C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this TV for about a week. Set up is a breeze although I soon realized an upgrade of my home theater is needed as this TV is quite advanced and only comes with the latest input/output jacks - this makes my 10-year old receiver instantly obsolete so I went out and bought a new one for the TV! Sound quality from TV is mediocre but once I hooked it up with the new receiver, the difference is like day and night and I'm quite satisfied. Picture quality is fantastic - sharp, vivid and clear, far exceeds my old Samsung LCD! The built-in wifi is a great feature so you can access internet without a cable. I got it for a super bargin price of $999 with free shipping so it was an excellent deal.Pros: AMAZING picture quality - sharp, vivid and clear images. Built-in wifi and no need for wired connection. Internet apps. Ultra-slim profile, very thin and beautiful to look at.Cons: Sound quality is mediocre. Must hook up with home theater system or sound bar to enjoy great sound. TV stand is not swivable so viewing angle can not be easily adjusted. Input/output jacks on the side are cheapily made.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Do not buy", "Author": "Anthony A.", "ReviewID": "R3F5JQMG6K87AR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, I would like to say that I have 3 Toshiba HD TV's. So I am not Toshiba bashing.  But here are my issues with the 46uL605u which I purchased in December: The screen is \"splotchy\" the screen does not go black...it appears that there is a flashlight behind the screen causing gray areas about the size of my hand throughout the screen area.  In bright sceens, the picture is great...in dark sceens...you can easily see the uneven, gray lighted areas....looks \"milky\"....the dark sceens are have uneven lighting...Very dissapointing.  I called Toshiba, and they said that this is not a problem (to them) and they will make a note of it.  It looks like the LED light is showing throught the tv. The other problem that I have is from time to time, the screen freezes...the only way to solve this is to turn the tv off...again, very dissapointing.  This has happened when watching a disk and when watching cable tv.  Finally, yes, the sound is poor, but I overcame that with a sound bar. The other issues cannot be overcome.  I purchased this through Circuit City - I will be calling them to help out - I recently noticed that they have taken this product off of thier site...very dissapointed...DO NOT BUY.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "BJS", "ReviewID": "RZQ8MJDXLAKEM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV has an amazing picture but the sound stinks. It is so bad that they replaced the 1st TV we ordered.  The 2nd one is a little bit better but not much. It hardly has any bass.  When we hooked our surround system up to it there was quite a delay...so you either listen to sound that sounds like an old fashion radio or you listen to great sound that doesn't match the picture. If they would fix that it would be an awsome TV.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "great tv although.....", "Author": "Nayte Wilson", "ReviewID": "R3BQHHE6PPCI02", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV dirt cheap on my opinion for $345 at Mardens (a Maine discount store)  it has great pictures and my TV shows and movie look great. I have one thing I don't think which is when the TV is black all four corners have a light that shines on the screens and the black is milky, however this is not noticeable if your not on a blank black screen. The picture can be choppy but I fixed this with a few setting changes. I recommend if your playing a fast pace game or any game for that matter you should turn on \"game mode\" this doesn't make the color, contrast or brightness change instead it syncs the frame rate better so there is no lag from the controller onto the TV.One horrible thing... The sound sucks buy a soundbar!!For the price I will not complain.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good enough for money", "Author": "TheVZA", "ReviewID": "R1O4G4WSGLBVLG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Regarding the sound, the speakers ARE on the back and will give you muffled sound IF your TV is mounted on the wall.  Mine is in a corner on the stand and the sound is fine.  Picture colors are terrific.  I am having some issues with choppy HD display in fast-moving portions of scenes.  Probably why this TV is inexpensive. Although it may just be my cable box... Spend an extra $200 and go with an LG or something better.
