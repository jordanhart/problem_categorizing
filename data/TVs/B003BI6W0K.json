initially seems pretty good. The 2D picture is great and the price is very appealing.That said... Be warned the 3D crosstalk on this television is TERRIBLE!  We bought it with hopes primarily of enjoying a bunch of 3D games on our PS3 (Call of Duty: Black Ops and Gran Turismo 5) only to be confronted with staggering crosstalk and ghosting.  It was bad enough that my wife asked \"Is the TV broken?\"  I find that the 3D crosstalk makes playing some games dizzying, annoying and fatiguing.  In particular scenes with black on a bright (usually white) background will have your eyes crossing and head aching.  For the record, we've tried with both 1.3x and 1.4 HDMI cables to no avail.(Note: As of Dec 8th the following seems to no longer be an issue) Furthermore after viewing 3D content on the PS3 and then returning to the XMB we'd be in a very messed up state where the LG UI was corrupted and remained so until another 3D movie was played. Really screwy stuff. Hopefully we'll get a firmware update on the PS3 or LG end soon?Update (Nov 29th): Please see the user images above for examples of the crosstalk in 3D video.Update (Nov 30th): We've called LG twice about the crosstalk, the first call consisted of a 45 minute wait before they insisted we end the call and try against another kind of 3D content (we did, the problem persisted).  The second call resulted in a 60 minute wait, speaking to a person for 2 minutes to confirm my name and phone number, then a 10 minute wait before being accidentally hung up on... LG is _really_ not impressing me here.Update (Dec 2nd): We just had the LG Tech over about the 3D crosstalk issues.  He confirmed that the 3D glasses and IR Transmitter were all functioning properly. After insisting there was no problem by examining some low cross-talk videos (like under water scenes) we showed the tech the scene I attached screenshots of (to user images above) and he was finally convinced that the crosstalk was really bad. He then left to his van for a bit (I assume to talk to his boss) and returned insisting that '3D is in it's infancy and you can't expect the 3D to work very well'... What?! If you know it doesn't work, why are you selling it?! We suggested to him that maybe the white/black (or light/dark) refresh rate of LG LED TVs might not be adequate for 3D but he insisted that the refresh rate is perfectly fine for 3D (I beg to differ!). The tech finally offered to replace the IR unit in the TV but claimed he 'didn't think it would help at all.'So we confirmed that the TV is fine, the glasses are fine, the 3D content is fine (and the LG tech insisted that the light/dark refresh is fine) but somehow because 3D is in it's \"infancy\" there is horrible crosstalk?! That doesn't make any sense.Update (Dec 8th): So the LG technician came by again yesterday to replace the part (the one that he said had no chance of resolving the 3D crosstalk problem). He (and I) were right, replacing this IR board did nothing at all to effect the 3D crosstalk/ghosting issues. I've confirmed the same amount of crosstalk in the PS3 Sizzler video and in MotorStorm 3D Rift. The technician explained that replacing the part is all he can do and from here on out it's between us and LG support... I love it when an employee of a company absolves themselves of helping you... /sigh.Update (Dec 13th): Minus one star because LG is making this whole crosstalk problem so painful for us.  We just ended our 8th call with them and they're insisting on sending another tech to look at our TV rather than giving us a replacement.Update (Dec 15th): I've done an analysis of the crosstalk on this TV with a high speed video camera, you can see it here: [...]  I think this is very convincing evidence that this TV suffers from strong crosstalk.Update (Jan 20th): So we've now made two dozen calls to LG and had six technicians check out our TV.  Although every technician agrees with us that crosstalk is a major problem on this set LG is stonewalling us and refusing to exchange or replace the TV.  In the executive service reps words \"we don't deal with customer service issues\" and \"in eight years here I've never seen a replacement offered to an unsatisfied customer\".  I wish those were LG's official mottos because if they were I could have saved myself a lemon of a purchase.The Good:* The 2D image is really great in most situations (No complaints watching Avatar, playing GT5, COD:BO, etc. in 2D).* Good value for the size and features.* The firmware for this TV is being actively supported by LG.* This is the only TV I've ever owned that doesn't letterbox when connected to my wife's Mac mini.The Bad:* 3D crosstalk/ghosting ruins 3D functionality for almost all movies and games.* Terrible telephone support from LG.* Horrendous flash-lighting on blank black screen (especially with auto-dimming off)* Overall the brightness seems very uneven in dark scenes, with or without local dimming enabled.* Local dimming is a joke, there appear to be only about 24 dimming fields.  This is not enough resolution to be practically useful.* The UI is mediocre, you will be shown an annoying pop-up every time you enable 3D or DLNA.  I hate pop-ups.* If you have any problems LG will be completely loath to help you, we're 8 calls, 2 tech visits and countless hours into dealing with them and have no resolution in sight.* LG, admitting problems with the 3D technology in their LED TVs is moving to another, passive, tech for their next generation of 3D sets.Note: DON'T BUY FROM ADORAMA unless you are VERY sure you are going to love your TV.

The 2D picture display was great right out of the box. You can cutomize the display but I went back to the standard settings. The first 3D viewing was not that great. I subscribe to Comcast and there is a limited amount of 3D content On Demand. These are olded 3D formats and there is significant ghosting. The only 3D Blue-Ray DVD I could get my hands on is Monster House. The 3D was much better but there was fast action blurring. I don't believe Monster House was created in 3D just upgraded. We watched the ESPN 3D broadcast of the Ohio State game and the 3D was tremendous! I've said all that just to say that the 3D experiance depends on the quality and format of what your watching. The TV can definantly display it. My only complaint is there are no standand RCA type output jacks for audio to connect to my stero system. It does of course have home theater digital output. I'm glad I've waited on the purchase of an HDTV and that this is the package I've got.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "UPDATE YOUR FIRMWARE ASAP! (See update #3); 3D could be better, but really isn't THAT bad... (See update #3 as well)", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R188EV63VNG448", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While there is a lot to like about this TV (and why I still rated it 3-stars [CHANGED TO 5-STARS! See update #3]), I will choose to focus my review on what I feel is (was) the only real issue with it.(You can go read the other reviews to hear about how nice the image quality is, how thin the TV is, how well the DLNA works, how polished the menu system feels, and whatever people might think about the various apps.)The reason I chose an LCD over a Plasma comes down to the 120/240 Hz smoothing. (Colors, black-level, and input lag [mainly for gaming] weren't high on my list of considerations.)======================================IF YOU KNOW ABOUT THE WHOLE \"LCD VS. PLASMA\" THING AND JUST WANT TO READ MY THOUGHTS ON THIS SPECIFIC TV, SKIP THIS SECTION.======================================Yes, I know plasmas refresh at 600 Hz, but it seems the manufacturers of those TVs have chosen to focus on delivering the 24/30/60 Hz source material as true to the original as possible. As such, you get your 60 Hz television feed as 60 discrete images shown to you over the course of a second. (Ok, I know it's like 59.6245 Hz, but we're going to go with 60). I do not like way that looks. That's not how the world looks and that's not how CRTs generally worked. And that's why I went with the LCD.With an LCD, you do get some blurring between frames, but I kind of like that. I find it more pleasant to look at than the \"chunk, chunk, chunk\" look of \"here's a frame, here's a frame, here's a frame\" plasmas give. On top of that, 120/240 Hz LCDs now almost all (as far as I know) have the ability to \"interpolate\" (essentially \"make up\") new image frames to go in-between the frames it is being fed. (So, when you feed your TV a 60 Hz signal, it will take those 60 frames and actually figure out what the frame in-between any given frame will look like and show that to you, too.) This (combined with maybe a bit of the blurring) is what yields the nice, smooth images you seen on LCDs.So, I think I found maybe one plasma TV that would do the 60 Hz => 120 Hz interpolation? Due to this, plasma did not seem like a viable solution for my needs.======================================RESUME REVIEW======================================Now, as far as the Trumotion (240 Hz interpolation) for this specific TV goes, here is what I have found (for cable TV and DLNA streaming):*Whenever there is a panning landscape or a panning generally-static scene, the imagine looks fabulous! Trumotion makes such a huge difference. With it off, it's so blurry and awful.*Whenever there's a generally static background with moving people/actors (like on a talk-show), the Trumotion looks great.>>THIS IS THE PART I AM MOST UNHAPPY ABOUT<<*However, when these two are combined (e.g. moving camera and moving people), lots of artifacting crops (i.e. little chunks of the image which just don't look quite right... This mostly occurs at the border between stationary and moving objects).>>THIS IS THE PART I AM MOST UNHAPPY ABOUT<<[As an aside: I bought my parents a Sony BRAVIA V-Series KDL-46V5100 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV, Black for Christmas last year and never noticed any of these artifacting issues I am experiencing. Maybe I wasn't looking closely enough and they're there? Or maybe sitting a bit farther back helps? Or maybe their cable box helps smooth-out some of these issues? Please, feel free to leave some comments here about your experiences with this!]I still have yet to watch any Blu-ray movies (or DVD for that matter), so I can't comment on that. [Will be sure to update my review for that.]Also, I have had minimal exposure to 3D so far, but it has been mostly disappointing. All I have gotten to watch is split-screen left/right videos I've found online, and they have mostly had lots of crosstalk (i.e. the \"ghosting\" that shows up when your right eye sees a bit of the video meant for your left eye and vice versa). [Will also update my review for this when I get some Blu-ray 3D movies to watch.]Lastly, I just wanted to point out that there was already a firmware update for my TV when I got it. It didn't make much difference for me, but others pointed out it helped in a few regards. So, if anyone from LG is reading this review, please work on some firmware updates for the Trumotion artifacting and 3D crosstalk issues!!!! I will certainly update my review for a new firmware which helps remedy these problems!UPDATE 10/6/2010:Just watched Iron Man 2 on Blu-ray. Still had the same artifacting issues with the Trumotion (anti-)Judder turned on... (FYI, I had my [LG] Blu-ray player set to 1080p/24.)Also, was looking through the manual for this TV. It mentions in the Trumotion section that if the Judder control causes \"noise\" to set it to \"off\"... Basically, they're admitting that it's half-cooked? (FWIW, I checked the manual for the Samsung UN46C7000, and it basically says the same thing. However, I've never noticed this much noise on any other 120/240 Hz LCD TV...)UPDATE 10/8/2010:2D Video:I realized that, while I've been trying to minimize the amount of image processing the TV does by turning off everything under \"Advanced Control\" (under picture settings), I bought this TV because of the \"Trumotion\" image interpolation. That there is a lot of image processing... So, I decided, \"what they hey! Why not try the 'Noise Reduction' settings.\"I'm going to have to experiment with \"Noise Reduction\" and \"Digital Noise Reduction\", but I have them both set to \"High\" and I like what I'm seeing. It seems like, instead of showing the image will all of the artifacting and noise, it just drops the framerate back down to the original source data. This is a huge improvement on what I was getting before.3D Video:So, I got my copy of IMAX: Under the Sea 3D in the mail today from the LG Blu-ray player promo. All I can really say is, it's a good thing I got this for the price I did and I really don't care too much about 3D! The amount of crosstalk is absolutely horrible. Clearly the display can't switch between black and white quickly enough. Here's hoping a later firmware update will help with this a bit... In the mean time, IF YOU'RE BUYING FOR 3D, GET A PLASMA!!!UPDATE 10/12/2010:LG must have just released a new firmware in the last day or two and, I must say, now I love love LOVE my TV! It fixed most of the Trumotion issues I was experiencing! So glad they made this fix. So, as soon as you get your TV, UPDATE THE FIRMWARE!Also, just wanted to say, the 3D really isn't THAT bad... Last night I watched through IMAX: Under the Sea 3D since I hadn't watched more than 5~10 minutes yet. There were definitely some really obvious crosstalk issues when it's trying to switch between black-and-white for the left-and-right frames... However, I found it was largely watchable on the whole. So, I guess I'll just continue considering it a bonus and not something I bought the TV explicitly for...", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "good 2D TV, not good 3D TV", "Author": "Charles Soccerleg", "ReviewID": "R15RU8BPJQNY7S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV gives very good pictures for 2D content.

I couldn't believe my eyes. I tried to watch a football game on the LG and when action happened and the camera moved quickly the LG couldn't keep up. When the camera was still the background was blurry and the colors where over stated. When my son connected his xBox to the LG TV the refresh rate just couldn't keep up with the game play and the picture was splitting up. 3D on the LG didn't work properly and was also hard to watch. The 3D image always had shadows. I tried different settings and just couldn't get a good picture. This LG TV was just horrible. The only saving grace to the whole ordeal was Amazon. Their customer service is amazing. First I got the TV on time from their delivery carrier. When I called to return the LG TV Amazon didn't make me feel uncomfortable about returning a high priced item, in fact they where apologetic that I was having such issue with a product purchased from them. The customer service representative asked what was the problem and then processed the return. The delivery carrier picked up the TV on time again and I was quickly credited back for the full price. EXCELLENT SERVICE AMAZON.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great value/quality. Easy to set up/use", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "R1NW8GWJKW9GSI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As soon as we turned on this TV, we were impressed by the difference in quality between it and our last TV (a 42\" plasma, which has since been relocated to our bedroom).  The unit itself is sleek and modern, and looks a great deal larger than we'd expected, probably due to it's slimmer dimensions.  It's light weight enough that my husband installed it on it's mount by himself (although I would definitely recommend using two people to do so, just for safety's sake.  He just couldn't wait to turn it on).  It also seems very durable.  Our cats are frequently trying to reach up and smack the screen (much to our annoyance, and at first, fear), but so far almost seven months later, there's not a single scratch, dent, etc in the screen or exterior.Immediately, we were dazzled by the improvement in picture quality.  Especially as we'd been using a plasma HDTV, and plasma is know for it's superior picture quality in comparison to LCD.  However, our LG LCD definitely was the winner between them.  Even just with standard digital cable, there was a large difference.  We changed it to an HDTV station, and the change was HUGE.  Blu-ray movies are gorgeous. Sound quality is great.  With our plasma, we'd had to adjust the tv's brightness for many of our PS3 games.  With this TV, I've only had to adjust it a few times (we bought it in Nov, 2010) and only for games that use less \"lighting\" than most.  Definitely one of the best TVs I've seen, even with the 2D.Now the 3D...It only adds to the aforementioned qualities.  The visual quality stays clear and precise.  The TV seems to keep up perfectly with the additional motion on screen, caused by the 3D, keeping the picture just as lovely as 2D, yet far more realistic.  I know that some of the other reviews mention ghosting and lag, but I've had no such problems.  Even with PS3 games (including Call of Duty: Black Ops), the flow seems just as good as 2D, and the game play is much more fun.  There was no hassle with connecting our PS3 to this TV.  You simply plug in the HDMI cable, and the PS3 and TV do the rest for you.  When you play a game that has 3D capabilities, it will either automatically load in 3D (though you can turn the 3D off if you'd prefer to play in 2D simply by hitting a button on the remote), or the game itself will prompt you asking if you'd like to play in 3D or not.  Easy.In addition to the wonderful picture quality and 3D capabilities (which would have been enough on their own for me to purchase this TV) comes the little conveniences like Widgets (weather updates, stock updates, twitter, etc all able to be personalized by you) and Netcast apps (Netflix instant access, providing you have an account with them. A couple of apps that allow you to download movies (including some 3D ones) directly to your tv.  An MLB app, and a few other apps).  We use our Netflix account almost daily through our TV, and also make use of the movie download apps as well.  All of them seem to work well and easily. You only need to sign into your account for the appropriate app, and the tv takes care of the rest for you.  The Netflix app even pulls up your instant queue so you can sort through what you've already marked you'd like to watch, or you can Search or Browse, just like you can on your computer or gaming system (although I find it much easier to flip through on the TV than the other options).Here are my only complaints:1.) It has an Ethernet port, so if you can connect it to your wired internet, this point won't bother you.This TV is NOT WIRELESS. Out of the box, it will only connect to the internet (internet isn't necessary for watching tv, movies, or games.  You will only need the internet for software updates, which LG releases automatically periodically, and for use of the widgets and Netcast) directly through it's Ethernet port.  But if you don't have an Ethernet jack in the room you're putting your TV in and you want internet on this TV, you're going to have to buy something to make it connect. It IS wireless READY.  This means you CAN put it on a wireless network, HOWEVER you HAVE to have some additional accessory to do so.  LG makes an access point specifically enabling it's TVs to do this (It looks like a USB thumbdrive). I bought a wireless range extension (Our's is Netgear, and almost looks like a wireless router, but the unit doesn't have to be connected to an ethernet port to receive internet signal).  The extension wirelessly connects to your wireless router, gaining wireless signal for itself.  You can then physically plug an Ethernet cable from the extension unit to your TV.  It will automatically connect to your network as though it were plugged directly into an Ethernet line, putting you immediately online.  Again, this is a hassle free process.  You only need to plug the extension in (or the LG access point, or the actual Ethernet cable), and you're connected to the internet, with no other effort necessary on your part.  We chose the extension because it also doubles as a signal boost (our TV, PS3, and computers are at the opposite end of our house, and Ethernet isn't wired anywhere except the room the router is in), so we can not only connect the TV to the network, but the same unit improves the signal the rest of our electronics receive as well.  So really, it worked out better in our case because we'd be buying the extension anyway.2.) I'd really like to see a greater variety in Widgets (maybe other networking sites for example, as the only thing currently available is Twitter) and Netcast Apps.  When we bought this TV, I was very pleased with the Apps that came on it.  But now that technology's changed a bit, there should be updates to increase the amount of Apps available.  An App for Hulu specifically would be very much appreciated.  There's no web browser available either, and though not a necessity, it would be a nice option if LG released an update to include it.But those are my only complaints.  My husband and I both love this TV, and use it a lot.  My parents even come over specifically to take advantage of 3D movies.Now, in regards to value... When we bought this TV, we were lucky enough to find it on a special that included four pairs of shutter glasses (which are a NECESSITY) included in the base price.  But even if it hadn't included the glasses, it still would have been an incredible value.  I spent several weeks researching different 3D TVs, and finally had it narrowed down a choice between this one, and a Sony 47\".  The reason why I chose this one, was very simply, the price.  The specs were essentially the same, yet there was almost $800 difference in the prices.  Now, at this point, I have to acknowledge that Sony is my favorite brand when it comes to electronics.  And that was where most of my debate came from.  I've never had any problems with the LG products I've owned, and I know people that swear by them (And I certainly love my LG washer and dryer).  But I grew up with a parent that only bought Sony, and I am just more familiar with them as a company.  But faced with the dramatic difference in price for essentially the same TV, I decided to go with the LG.The best part about that...I didn't realize at the time, but apparently most 3D TVs don't come with the 3D receiver built in. THIS LG TV DOES. My father bought a Sony 3D TV about a month after we purchased this one (and he still paid about $1000 more for his, and it's a 42\").  He STILL doesn't have the 3D receiver or the glasses to go with it (which in total is over $1000 more expensive, based on four pairs of glasses and the receiver).  So he bought this new 3D TV (it IS a good TV though. Beautiful picture quality, but still no big difference from our LG.  It does have a few more internet-needed Apps though), but can't actually make use of it's 3D capabilities.  I have a friend who bought a Samsung 3D TV that has the same problem.  You're saving between $100-$200 by buying this TV just by NOT having to buy the 3D receiver to go with it.Overall, it's an incredibly impressive TV, that gives you excellent quality for an excellent price.

I have this TV in my bedroom, so I don't use it too much for 3d.  I also have the Toshiba WX800U but the LG is way better in terms of DLNA support (or LG's implementation).  My primary use for thiss TV is streaming content from my TVersity media server.  Zero configuration, I just turned on the TV and i'm streaming away.  The WX800U doesn't see my media server at all, and there isn't really a way to configure it to do so without a fair bit of kludging around server side.I did notice some ghosting in 3 or 4 scenes while watching Christmas Carol 3D.  The ghosting is most perceptible when a bright 3D object is in front of a dark background.  Mildly annoying but certainly not enough to detract from the overall experience.  The same ghosting can be seen on the Toshiba.2D & 3D picture quality is about the same on the WX800U and this set.I did manage to try out Netflix on both sets.  The UI for the WX800U Netflix app is rather limited -- only allowing access to your instant queue, can't search, add new movies to queue, see recently played or browse.  The Netflix app on the LG is much better and allows you to do all of the aforementioned functions missing from the Toshiba.Overall, they're both very good LED's.

Technical reviews have praised this TV for the measurable accuracy and quality of its color output.  You can tell when you're watching it.  You can even see the day to day difference in shades of orange on the skin of John Boehner and Snooki between their trips to the tanning salon.  Everything else about this TV is disappointing.Despite great colors, there is clear color banding.  I have tried adjusting the picture settings to fix this, but the banding only stops when I turn the brightness way below where I want it.I prefer having local dimming on, but it leads to weird effects.  The screen is divided into sections, and, if one spot in a section is lit, the entire section lights ups. This is the idea behind local dimming, but the edge lighting here really detracts from picture quality.  When there is light in a dark screen, it looks like there's a spot light illuminating it from the side of the screen.  This enhances the effect of search lights in prison break scenes but is otherwise distracting.I had a lot of trouble getting the Ethernet to work on the TV.  After hours of adjusting MAC and IP addresses and restarting the TV and the router, one of the automatic set ups finally took after many reboots. I mainly wanted the Ethernet connection to get an update to fix the problems with 3D, which brings me to 3D.I have had significant problems with ghosting when trying to watch 3D content.  I watched a few of the on demand 3D movies from Comcast, and there were distracting amounts of ghosting.  I hoped this was a Comcast issue, but I got my first 3D Blu-Ray and the ghosting problems are still there. Switching between left/right and right/left doesn't help with these issues. If you're buying this TV, you should be getting it for the 3D feature.  If you buy this TV, you won't get much of a functional 3D TV. Don't buy this TV.(BTW, the TV didn't recognize the Comcast content as 3D at first.  I got a message that said the 3D content wasn't actually 3D. I noticed that, when I selected a 3D movie, the cable box switched to 480i output. Once I found out how to use the manual controls to overide the resolution output on the cable box, the TV accepted the signal and the 3D worked--except for the ghosting.)", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "a great tv, good replacement for high end plasma", "Author": "john mckenna", "ReviewID": "R1BZUKKM9IZG0T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to replace a 42inch Pioneer Elite Plasma, and am happy to report that this set holds up to the Pioneer which I felt was (and purely in picture quality arguably still is) the best tv picture commercially available.  I waited a long time for LCD/LED technology to evolve to the point where the pros of replacing my set would outweigh the cons.  The 3D capability got me off the fence, but I never would have made the leap without the inherent improvement in 2D viewing offered by the contrast, black levels, and refresh rate capabilities of this set.  This set offers loads of features in addition to 3D which are not available in the older high end plasmas (internet connectivity, automatic firmware updates, return channel in the hdmi, weight and slim profile, etc...). Equally noteworthy is what is not featured, most importantly screen burn in and buzzing.  Also, this tv looks great when set up, not just from carefully selected camera angles.  FYI, \"Espresso\" looks black unless the set is in bright sunlight (not great viewing...) or you shine a flashlight at the trim.Having spent a lot of time watching different types of programming and tinkering around with picture settings, I am pleased with the viewing experience offered by this set.  I cannot say that it is better than the Pioneer plasma, but the bottom line is that it does indeed stand up to it.  A picture is truly worth a thousand words, and it is impossible to articulate all of the differences, but this set does not leave you feeling disappointed compared to watching the top of the line plasmas.However, a lot of technology goes into making LCD/LED sets, including this one, look as good as plasmas and you have to be careful with the settings you choose.  The most striking difference in the viewing experience in this set (and all 1080p sets with higher than 60Hz refresh rates) out of the box is the smoothness created by the TrueMotion (default set to on) technology coupled with the 1080p definition.  The images created are so smooth and clear that actors and objects almost look like holograms.  This is great for sports, fast action sequences, animation, and gaming but creates an odd sensation when watching tv shows or movies.  This is commonly referred to as the \"soap opera\" effect because it creates a look reminiscent of old soap operas that were video taped, not filmed, and has been described as \"artificial\", \"like home video\", or \"like a low end documentary\".  This effect is created by the True Motion technology because it is displaying extra frames by refreshing more times per second than the original filmed content contains (in most cases 24 fps).  This is great for eliminating blurring and displaying crystal clear sports action, and makes actors appear incredibly life like, but I find it disconcerting when watching any filmed entertainment.  On one hand I like it because it is so life like - it seems like you are on the set watching the filming.  But on the other, a lot of work goes into creating a set and filming a movie so that it feels \"real\" when you watch it, and the True Motion technology strips that away.  But this whole issue is not unique to this tv, it is inherent in the technology.  What is important is this set allows you to SIMPLY TURN OFF THE TRUE MOTION FEATURE AND THE SOAP OPERA EFFECT IS GONE.  I have read that some sets do not allow this to be turned off, and that could be a real problem for some viewers, so investigate it if you think this would bother you.All of this technology was introduced to combat what critics call \"judder\" and \"blurring\" which occurs when watching fast action filmed entertainment or live sports.  This tv displays both remarkably well with little judder or blurring even when the True Motion is turned off.  I turn off True Motion when watching anything that was filmed, and turn it on LOW when watching anything that is live or video taped (like sports, late night tv, or news) and this works well for me.  The set itself has several pre-set picture modes and two customizable settings which are easily accessible to make the switch quickly.  The set offers a wide range of adjustments to dial in the picture, and has a useful \"picture wizard\" that guides you through setting up your customizable pre-sets.  Like most modern sets, there are so many ways to adjust the picture you can make yourself mental fooling around with it if you are so inclined.  There are some good articles out there that provide specific expert setting levels for the LE8500 which when applied to this set are much better than I got to on my own.  So to my view,  this set with a quick adjustment (minor hassle) is great for watching both movies (not quite as good as Pioneer) and sports (better than Pioneer).The set has great sound processing capability, but the speakers can only do so much.  It is very easy to connect a sound bar to this set, which is what I have done.  If you use hdmi (high speed cables) to connect all of your components, you can run a single digital audio out cable from the tv to virtually any home theater sound system receiver or sound bar and listen to all of your components.  The tv handles all of the switching perfectly.  The sound system always stays set to TV, but plays sound from anything that is attached to the TV via hdmi.  Cool.  And much appreciated.Finally, the 3D really works.  For a long time I felt the whole advent of 3D tv (and movies for that matter) was a gimmick and have to say I am amazed at how well it works.  The technology is so new and there is so little to actually watch it is hard to judge and make comparisons.  There is some ghosting from time to time, but that seems more related to the media than the set.  Some titles, like \"Under the Sea\" display terrificly but I don't really know what to be looking for as far as flaws.  The 3D is really clear and highly effective on this set when viewing 3D Blu Ray discs with proper content.  But the novelty of 3D wears off pretty quickly so I am looking forward to some non-bundled content coming down the pike.  Do James Cameron and the Avatar people really need so much more money that it was worth selling out to Panasonic, setting a precedent which is going to dramatically slow down the evolution of meaningful 3D content for tv viewers, possibly to the point that we all lose interest? (ooops, excuse me I forgot this was a tv review on Amazon not a soap box)  Anyway, this set is connected to the internet and it keeps itself updated which is a fantastic development, and hopefully will allow it to keep up with 3D developments for awhile.This is an excellent 2D tv - better at some things than my old Pioneer Elite, and not quite as good at others.  And the 3D seems good to me.  I would recommend this TV, especially at this price bundled with the glasses and Blu Ray player (no movies).  Unless you are seriously dedicated to imperceptibly deep blacks and are willing to limit the use of your tv to avoid burn in, this tv is a great choice.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV for the price", "Author": "ssingh", "ReviewID": "RF75449OCBNN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have owned it for over a month now.

Based on opinions and personal experience one decides what brands are good/reliable to them. A couple of months ago I helped my in-laws pick out a LG 42LE5400. I was so impressed with everything about the TV, I knew I had to have an LED when the time came for me to get another HDTV. I wanted something thinner and less heavy than my Sharp Aquos LC46D64U. So from my experience I wanted LED and I knew after my in-laws' LG, I wouldn't mind trying one out.I honestly bought the LG 47LX6500 because I wanted an LED TV with Internet Apps. I really didn't care about the 3D. When bought through Amazon though, the price was great, about $150 more than the LG 42LE5400 my in-laws bought from a big store the spring before. Amazon were tossing in four pairs of active shutter glasses also.So here is what I think(my opinion)....2D the picture is amazing. I watch quite a few movies on it and they look great. I turn off trumotion because it is only useful while watching sports and makes other content look like live soap opera bad. 3D looks amazing on this TV as long as one follows the rules. The TV says you should sit at least 2 meters (about 6ft) away from the TV. The distance really makes a difference, I suggest more like 9ft. The closer you are the more you have to shift your eyes to see what is going on on one side of the screen to the other, I think this is more the reason peoples \"ghosting\" issues occur in the 3D. In my opinion, the eyes can't focus fast enough. Some of it has to do with 3D content also I believe, Despicable Me on 3D bluray looked great, Call of Duty: Black Ops on Xbox 360 didn't. As for the internet apps. I have netflix so my main concern was that netcast had that and it does among other pay for content sites. The youtube search on netcast is better in my opinion than going to the actual site and I believe that the LG TVs (netcast) should be getting hulu+ sometime also. I would like an internet browser though.The TV is thin and lightweight, has a great looking 2D and 3D picture, internet applications, and the refresh rate keeps up with gaming.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "3d Content is what its all about.", "Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "R22MURJWDIFS71", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After owning this tv for about 3 months, I have determined how to rate this tv. I will split this review in two parts in order to help out in decision making based off  of wants and needs.2dFirst off, the 2d is outstanding. I haven't seen a tv that compares in colors, contrasts, and life this tv gives to the image. I have an HD cable box that only provides a 1080i signal... but, WOW does this tv deliver. I haven't seen quality as good even in 1080p on other 1080p tv's. This is my second personally owned HD tv. I would recommend buying a 3d tv to anyone buying since the quality of the picture is so good compared to non 3d tv's.3dI have had a very mixed experience with 3d. I own a Playstation 3, and choose this as my primary source to view 3d content, as it has proven to be 100x more stable at displaying a 3d image than my LG 3d blu ray player has. I would have returned it if it hadn't come free with my tv. As far as movies go, some movies have been mind blowing in quality, while I have seen a lot of ghosting in other movies. In my opinion, this would have to do more with the content itself than it would the tv. I know the tv is capable of displaying good content because movies like Open Season, Under the Sea, and A Christmas Carol look amazing on the tv. However, I have not seen other tv's to compare overall 3d quality.As far as 3d gaming goes, the best game I've played is a free demo downloadable on the playstation network. Call of Duty Black Ops would be second best due to the limited ghosting and decent added depth to the image.Overall, I would recommend this tv to a lower price seeker, as it does provide a good 3d image with the right content. The 2d is outstanding, and you really can't beat the price on here.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Discontinued Product", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Skipper\"", "ReviewID": "R3PXF4L6IX1TO4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered the LG TV and recieved a call from the vendor a few days later informing me that the product was discontinued and had been replaced by a new version.

I already have a 65\" plasma. I've seen LED TV's of late and wanted to go that route for the advantage of less power consumption and light weight with a thin depth. I only went the 3D route because amazon had a deal tossing in the 3D LG blu-ray dvd player AND \"four\" pairs of 3D classes. Usually you only get two pairs, if they have a promo going. Four pairs of 3D glasses was too good to pass up. NOW about me... I am VERY motion sickness person. I cannot watch movie theater 3D movies without feeling a bit queazy afterwards. And 3D video games, or video games with fluid motion I cannot do AT ALL. So I actually did not think I would use the 3D function of this LG 3D LED TV. But I have to say after watching a few of the few available 3D Blu-ray movies for these TV's, I have no problems with dizzy or woozy feelings after watching a 3D BR movie on this set with the LG 3D glasses. It does not bother me at all. I actually love the 3D on this TV, and enjoy the movies. I've been told the \"movie theater\" 3D is different technology and harder on the eyes and causes more dizzy feelings. And was told that these newer \"home-viewing\" 3D electronic shutter-glasses gave a better 3D experience with little motion sickness (for those that have that problem, like me). Well all I can say is that was correct. I have no issues or problems watching this 47\" LG LED 3D TV with 3D BR movies. None!After owning this set and watching 3D movies on it, I can see how the industry is betting on 3D home TV to catch on. It is a fun experience. Visually fun. And I really like this TV. I hooked it up, and connected my internet via a cable (wired), and all the internet functions work very nice. Also did the software update on the set. I already have a BR dvd player with apps built-in (netflix, vugu, so on), and also, the free LG 3D BR player that came with this set in the promo-deal too has the same apps built-in. BUT... having these apps available thru the TV itself is something I REALLY LOVE. I don't have to turn on the BR DVD player to watch netflix or vudu. I can just jump into those apps using only the TV. I wish my other TV (65\" plasma) had apps built into it like this LG does. So convenient to have everything built into one device, especially the TV.  One note: I DID buy the optional LG add-on wireless USB plug and it has not worked out. Using the wireless USB, keeps dropping the internet connection offline, then re-connecting a few seconds later. This dropping then reconnecting thing keeps happening constantly when using the LG add-on USB wireless plug on the TV. So I am just using the wired connection for internet for now. I probably will have to wire an permanent internet cable thru the wall to the TV room so it looks neat. Or move my router into the same room as the TV. BTW... I am using the LG USB wireless plug that goes with this TV (optional purchase), so these LG wireless USB connectors just do not work well, at least my experience.Also.. The LG 3D BR DVD player that came with this TV promo-package DOES already have wireless built in to the DVD player, and using that wireless built-in does NOT have the drop connection issues that the LG USB wireless plug has. So I feel its the LG USB wireless plug itself at issue. I guess i could call LG and see if there is some firmware update for the USB wireless plug itself.But... Love the 3D TV. Love the LED and light weight, thin cabinet. To me the picture is pretty great, and I have the plasma TV to compare it to. Both have great pictures. I think most people will be very happy with the 3D quality on this set. It looks great to me! And I've done some visual comparing of LCD, plasma and LED backlit tv's and I find LED to have a super picture above most other types. I Do recommend this 47\" LG LED 3D TV #6500 for those getting into 3D.The LG 3D glasses are light weight, fit around your eye glass glasses if you wear glasses, and the built-in battery lasts long. Family members have watched several 3D movies in a row and the LG 3D glasses battery lasted throughout.(ps. only give this review 4 starts because this is my first 3D TV experience. Not to say in any way this TV doesn't deserve 5 stars)**UPDATE Feb 25 2011 ***Well I still love this TV. Have done a couple firmware updates since purchase. I ended up hardwiring an internet cable to the TV since (as stated above) I had dropping connecting issues with the optional LG wifi USB plug.One thing of issue is there are no analog audio outputs on the back of this TV. Only optical out. I wanted to hook up a video media chair to the TV audio out (chair only has Red/White audio inputs)but cannot because the TV has none. LG really should have included red-white analog audio outputs on the TV.

LG did not include Amazon's Video On Demand in their Netcast lineup -- perhaps, a future software upgrade will rectify that omission.2.

But I got four pairs of glasses as part of the special deal.* The system automatically switches to a new input when it goes live. This is annoying until you get used to it. But eventually you will find it to be convenient.The recommended LG 3D bluray player is also great.Cons* I wish the remote control could be programmed to handle my cable box.* The USB ports power up and down twice during startup. That's a bad design and not good for attached equipment.* The sound is really poor. However, believe it or not if you prop a couple of plastic or wood storage boxes behind the unit at the locations of the speakers, the sound will improve quite a bit.* The sound equalization and volume controls do not work through the optical and headphone outputs and no, I didn't want yet another remote and yet another punch-through problem to try and program.* You can't change the on-screen system labels for input ports. You can add a description, but obviously it's not always going to match the port name.* I wish there was a way to add a keyboard. It's a pain to search NetFlix using the remote.Recommendations* Put everything on HDMI if possible. It is easier to deal with in \"simplink\".* Plug the headphone output into the CD, AUX or PHONO line input on a older 2.1 stereo system. I have a 5.1, but really I get everything I need with 2.1. After you do this you can control the volume from the TV remote and you can adjust for a good default equalization that works with everything. Note: the headphone output level is not sufficient for most computer speaker sets. You need something with a more sensitive line input, or you will need to add a preamp (and this will increase the noise level).* Decide how many HDMI cables you will ultimately need and buy them all on Amazon, where the prices are the best you will ever find!* Put a little color dot on the TV frame to indicate the location of the on switch if you tend to walk up to the TV. Otherwise you will always be fishing for the power sensor location.* Expect to seem some jerky motion playback on NetFlix. I tried every form of optimization but in the end, it's a matter of the source quality. I find that I can play HD movies with large amounts of motion as smooth as silk on Vudu, but the same movie and even some lower resolution programming is still jerky on NetFlix.* I do recommend you get an HBB1 broadband booster. It is amazing at making your internet connection efficient. Make sure to set the uplink speed manually to avoid recalibration interruptions.* Don't forget to buy the SquareTrade warranty. You can get up to four years.* Use a wired network connection.

For blurays or 3ds really good tv. Watching photos on Picasa is great. Only one problem, no buttons on tv for any function, touch panel which will not light up untill you touch at right place, thats bad, you have to have remote always with you.
