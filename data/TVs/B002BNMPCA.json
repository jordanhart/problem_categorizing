The 40\" Sharp Aquos LED exceeded my expectation for all four. There is absolutely NO heat emitted from the unit. It weighs only 30 pounds. The picture is the BEST I've ever seen in a TV -I'm not kidding here- the BEST. I waited about 6 months to post this feedback, thinking something might go wrong but no problems at all.My folks bought a 50\" Plasma at the same time and they've had a horrible time with heat coming from the TV; seems to heat the whole room (though that would be a nifty option on cold winter nights). Additionally their TV is extremely heavy and not easily moved. Their picture is nowhere near as good as mine.I believe this TV is underpriced, and a very good deal. I ordered through Amazon, and the delivery & installation was extremely good.", "Date": "December 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Hard to Beat", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2MJ0VIVTO671G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV replaced a 32\" VIZIO HDTV that I hung on the wall in the far corner of my bedroom last spring and subsequently discovered was too small for viewing at that distance (14').  This Sharp AQUOS is as advertised:  sleek, glossy, and energy efficient (75 Watts!) with a beautiful picture.My Ergotron pivot arm mounting system was sturdy enough to accommodate this under 30 lb. set with no problems.  I was even able to install it by myself.The set has no little lights glowing when it is off so it works well in the bedroom.  Setup was very easy with my DirecTV HD receiver and with my off-air antenna cable distribution system for all the local stations.  The favorite channel settings require some forethought before entering them, and I didn't find a way to skip/delete unwanted channels except by using the favorites system.  The set and picture are highly configurable, but I just use the 'auto' setting for the picture.  The blacks are incredible--to my eyes I don't know how they could be improved even though Sharp, wisely I think, avoided the fad of dynamic changes in LED backlight levels with their current LED offerings.  This HDTV series is also relatively cheap compared to the competition.I can't comment on the sound because I use a ZVOX original 315 that I have had for years.  I will say however that the audio circuitry is audibly superior to that of the VIZIO 32\" it replaced.  It doesn't 'pop' when you power the TV down and the AQUOS' sound through the ZVOX seems to include the full audio spectrum of the broadcast program.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but lacks two basic features", "Author": "EasyTiger", "ReviewID": "R1W5AXEIYGU5YD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV because I wanted two things: a good-quality picture, and the ability to play game consoles without any noticeable lag.  This TV does both very well.  It has stunning picture quality, and the game mode handles my old 480i XBox console, connected via component inputs, with no noticeable lag.On the downside picture-wise, I am not 100% satisfied with how the TV reproduces mostly-dark levels. Black is plenty black, but dark gray, dark blue, dark brown, etc. also get \"sucked\" into black.  The average person probably wouldn't be bothered by this, but it can be a little annoying to the discerning eye.  Adjusting contrast and brightness helps, but only at the expense of lightening the deep blacks.  If you love sharp contrast between dark and light, you'll love this TV.  If you're picky and want to see, for example, details in shadows, give this TV a test-run before buying it.I was quite surprised to see that this TV lacks two of the most basic functions of a TV: it has no clock, and the remote has no program guide button.  Obviously, this TV is intended for people who have satellite/cable since those services have programming guides.  But over-the-air digital TV also broadcasts program information, and there's no way to access that information on this TV.  So if you watch over-the-air TV, you'll still need to have a clock and a TV Guide nearby.Despite these drawbacks, I'm giving this TV 4 stars because of the excellent picture quality overall, and how well it handles my antiquated game console.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for a Great Price", "Author": "D. Hollinrake", "ReviewID": "R28EOZXULY3EYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price I paid for this TV, nothing can beat it. This was the best deal I could find for an LED TV back in February 2010. It is lightweight, uses next to nothing for power, and has 4 HDMI ports. Yes it also has an ethernet connection and I did hook it up just to see how it worked. It seems like more of a gimmick than anything really useful for me. Give me Netflix or full web browser then it becomes more useful.I updated the firmware since I've had this TV as well and had no issues with the update. The latest firmware \"improves performance on some digital and analog channels as well as improving performance of 1080i/720p signals input via HDMI\" according to Sharp's website. I personally haven't noticed a difference so all I can say is it didn't screw anything up.I have used the USB port to look at pictures. It works fine, nothing more to really say about that. Once you hit the power button the power LED light will come on letting you know that you have indeed hit the button. The blue chevron shaped light on the front can be disabled in the menus if you really don't like having it on.The remote has a light button on it but it only illuminates the POWER SAVING, VOL, CH, MUTE, MENU, and FREEZE buttons. One irritating thing about the remote is that some of the buttons are hidden under a cover that flips over at the bottom of the remote.**Update 18 Feb 2011**I've had this TV for about a year now and I have had no issues with it. Since setting it up, I haven't used the Ethernet port since playing around with the feature. It is now set up in my new house and mounted on an entertainment center instead of using the stand. It's more than light enough to easily swing it back and forth depending on where I am in the room. Obviously technology has advanced and there are much slimmer LED backlit TV's out there but if you can find this one cheap, I see no reason not to buy it.", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price.", "Author": "H. Zalonis", "ReviewID": "R284JDKKKURZIU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first impression of this TV was that it looked like a very large computer monitor.  It isn't a looker that's for sure, but once you get past that it is a very good TV. It had no dead pixels and all of the functions are easy to use and work as advertised. I also have an older Samsung 40\" LCD and this one beats it in image quality by a rather large margin. The set did require some tweaking to improve the picture quality, but was acceptable out of the box.One caveat is that you can't use the analog PC input at the display's native 1920x1080 resolution, it's quite easy to work around with a DVI to HDMI adapter cable. Not many computers use the old VGA ports these days and I bet analog will not be supported at all on TVs in the near future.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price!", "Author": "Jeremy Wilson \"spacebirdJ\"", "ReviewID": "R1UMP423J70ROT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After purchasing a Sharp Aquos 42\" LCD last year, and spending quite a bit of time doing research to find that particular set, I found myself wanting a smaller HDTV that I could easily put in my car and take with me when I travel to and from my work location.  I wasn't really looking for an LED, just wanting to find something cheap with a decent picture.  Then I saw this set from Sharp, and with the price, it seemed too good to pass up.  Compared to my 42\" Aquos LCD I would say that this one is really nice, but I still feel like my 42\" is better.  One of the top reasons is the sound quality on this set doesn't seem up to par.  I keep my volume at 19 when viewing, but there is a noticeable difference between this one and my other set.  If you're going to hook it up to a home theater system, I suppose this wouldn't really matter.  Of the 4 HDMI inputs, I have been unable to get HDMI Input #5 to work.  It has a ton of features so you can tweak to perfection.  The auto-contrast function seemed to make the picture too dark, but once turning it off, the picture is just what I want.  I love the remote, the button layout is about as close to perfect for me, very intuitive - the backlighting on the remote could be improved.  One function I really like about this set, is that its Menu options are Input specific (i.e. if I am using the HDMI port, it doesn't show Channel/Cable options, just options that relate to the HDMI).  The set is very light, easy to move.  All in all, I really like this LED TV, and for the low price - I love it.

The set is not the most beautiful.  As for the picture, it was sharp with little blur; the blacks were deep.  The colors require a little adjustment for flesh tones, however, the picture was so good that I have not been pressed as yet to do so.  There are workarounds for component video receivers but it would help to own one with HDMI input/output jacks.I have had two occasions to use the Yahoo widgets for the ethernet connection.

The PC interface needs work on these HDTVs overall, since HDTV-DVI and PC/VGA-XVGA video have incompatible formats. My PC/HDTV network is incomplete.  The PC video is deficient in comparison with the digital sources.  Many people may find the unscaled-shrunken PC display adequate.  I am not satisfied with the quality of the PC display, using a VGA connector. I may order a pricy video scaler or replace my PC's video card.

We sent it to be fixed, but the part was unavailable (and would be for months), so we contacted Sharp to see if they could provide the part or replace the unit. Since then, we have played an endless game of phone tag with customer service reps calling to give us \"offers\" to purchase a REFURBISHED Sharp television.

I was leaning towards Plasma because I game a bit and need low lag and clear, high-speed motion and they have excellent color contrast.  My research ended when I saw this on Amazon and compulsively bought it.Why?LED would mean brighter colors and greater contrast ratio than Plasma!The 120Hz refresh rate should eliminate the motion issues that all LCDs have!And it's $799, dummy!!!The reasons for my return...The contrast ratio's must be in reference to a purely dynamic one.  It doesn't beat high end plasmas and if you turn up the contrast to get it there, the image quality suffers greatly.  While the whites are whiter than a plasmas whites should be, you can turn up the plasmas whites and get them close.  I have a 55\" Samsung and confirmed this, but leave them on standard levels because I don't care.  The black levels are pretty black but destroy contrast in those areas when they get there.  I watched \"sing off\" on it in HD and mario lopez looked like a floating skin face.  And the crowd, less lit, looks the same way.  You loose a lot of detail in dark areas.I have read while studying that people can't tell the difference between 120Hz and 240 Hz, LCD refresh rates.  My father has a Phillips 40 inch 240hz LCD.  I compared the motion of last nights Monday Night Football on the 2 tvs.  I assure you, I can tell a difference, a big one, and am sure that you would too.  But if you didn't have them side by side to compare...would you notice?  Well, to each his own.  But I play a lot of games, and in gaming, motion issues are intolerable.  I noticed them.  Maybe a Sharp model with 240 Hz can compete with standard plasmas today, but this one cannot.But for $799, it's still a deal, right?Well, maybe...if you want to say you have an LED HDTV that is directly backlit. But if technology is irrelevant to you, and therefore only the image quality matters, then buy a plasma.  A 42 inch plasma that costs $799 today has a far greater picture than this TV has.  You can buy a Panasonic G25 that is sure to blow your mind for 800 bucks, that is what I'm going to do.  Plus, if you invite your friend who owns a G25 over to brag about your new LED, I am going to laugh at you and suggest that you should have read my review after you pass the chips.There is more than image quality to consider (not to me, but there is).  It consumes less power than a plasma so after a few years, the G25 will have cost more money.  Plasmas have more glare than an LCD typically does and I was impressed with this TV's low glare.  But these issues only tip in favor for the 700un after hundreds of hours of usage...would you really degrade hundreds of hours of image quality for a couple bucks...if so, don't buy a new TV anyway...save all the money.  This TV has a ton of image settings so that you can tweak to your hearts content.  The problem is that you can't save them and this TV has a disturbingly bad SD and even 720p image quality.  I hear you can change the settings to accomodate.  But that means that every time you change the channel you may have to pick up your notebook and look up your preferred settings and bla bla bla.  There are other things about this TV that I like and dislike, but none can change the fact that it's image, while technically HiDef, will not impress you like a top of the line 240Hz LCDs or any reputable Plasma.So I give 3 stars because this TV is so so meh.  But for 800 bucks I expect 5 stars and so should you.  And if I am watching late at night, I expect those 5 stars to be hot.  C'mon man!Boo.But amazon is great.  I got this thing in 3 days with free shipping...was told 5-8. Free return shipping?!?!  Warm up a G25 for me Mr. Amazon and give Mr. Discover my money back so we can do this all over again the right way.UPDATE:I bought the panasonic 42 inch G25 from amazon and it's picture is mind blowing.

Was going to buy from newegg and waited for stocking about a month... then they discontinued; not a good sign in retrospect.

presets(default picture settings),but with pro calibration and a dice of your own,you will be impressed.Some and many even pros say the 120hrt isnt present,but the thing is it is.I spent time calibrating my set for best picture possible and finding differences between motionflow and motion enhanced.Motionflow has a more lively on set feel with very obvious artifacts when high but,this is why Sharp has pulled me in.Motion enhanced creates the lively blend,you see if you have 20/20 vision like myself you will notice the effect to dramatically make you feel onset but also watching a movie,pure greatness.Im rating 24p 48/50 movies and 60p 100/120 games based on my gtx 280 and blu ray Playback,so imagine the effects of pure video plus nvidia control panal settings of 100% sharpness and 100% noise reduction with cuda.The tv may fall short if you only watch dtv but hdtv also shines.I also had heat issues before with my xbr brands,but this set barely pumps heat and is very light;no 1 eco friendly set in the world.Im planning on buying another set.Believe me the price is a steal,cant wait to play god of war 3 bottom line this is a must buy for hardcore gamers and day to day movie watchers 5 star general.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Colors are terrible", "Author": "Brian Williams \"Brian Williams\"", "ReviewID": "R1KOH3CI5275A8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm not sure I'm a fan of the LED technology when you get a cheap-o TV.  I guess I got what I deserved for not checking out the TV before buying it on the Internet...The pre-set factory colors were awful -- yellow is green, people's faces are purple.  There are LOTS of settings to adjust, but no matter how I play with the colors, I'm never happy overall with the way it looks.  What's strange is, with the LED technology, the colors actually change as the picture changes -- I noticed this especially when subtitles appear and go away at the bottom of the screen.I also secretly suspect that this TV was made purposefully bad as this was the precursor to the 'quadpixel' tech that 'corrects' yellow...", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Damaged-no sound, returned", "Author": "nopenname", "ReviewID": "R3IY2PUZKL1ZWR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was purchased as a gift since I already own a similar model.
