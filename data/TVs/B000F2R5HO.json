The picture was AMAZING.  Color was sharp, I was able to see a great picture from most angles and the color was fantastic.  Plus even up close you do not see the pixels as you would see in a plasma to lcd.  The sales person was right when she said, if I am not looking to hang it than for the same money you should go wtih Samsung new generation of dlp.  I was never a dlp fan before but this new generation is almost as good from a viewing angle and color intensity standpoint when compared to the crt it replaced.Needless to say I canceled the order at CC when I realize Amazon was selling this for $500 less plus free shipping.  Bought the tv, stand $180, monster 3500 $160 and the samsung 950 upconversion 1080p dvd player $150 and onyko recever $260.Why it didn't get 4 stars?The menu is slow, complicated and cumbersome.  I would like to be able to switch between both hdmi ports (dvd player and directv).  Its not as intutitive as the sony interface I am use to dealing with, the remotes were okay.The speakers are weak not that thats a problem but it would be for anyone who has no plan to buy a home theater.delivery was great, brought it to my seond floor, stripped down box, styrofoam and took it with them.oh btw try figuring out how to turn the tv speaker off, I had to read the manual twice to do that.  I have no doubt once I get everything set up the way I want it should be a piece of cake to navigate.Its been 2 weeks, the picture is amazing even for non HD shows.  For the non HD I would recommend setting it up so the picture is NOT stretched.For those of you trying to size up your space.  50\" tv, I am sitting about 7 to 8 feet away.  No eye strain, no pixelation but I will say when the picture moves too fast I get motion sickness.", "Date": "September 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "A phenomenal picture and good looking cabinet!", "Author": "JanSobieski", "ReviewID": "R307U0P790PPHV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I agonized over this decision!  LCD flat panel?  Plasma?  DLP?  Rear projection LCD?  And on and on and on!!  Back and forth to the TV store and back again.  Did my research on the net and back to the TV store.  Then I placed an order on Amazon for $2249 with free shipping before the TV was in stock and waited patiently for 2 months.  At the same time, the end of July, I priced this TV at Circuit City and it was priced at $2600!!  And during that 2 months of course, I returned yet again to the TV store and did further comparisons.  Well, my wait paid off.  The TV dropped WAY down in price and Amazon, true to their word honored the lower price.  With free shipping to boot.  Hard to believe that the prices on this TV have fallen so dramatically in just 2 months!!First of all, this is a beautiful TV.  The high gloss cabinet first appealed to me and particularly to my kids but now I wish it were flat and no so reflective - a minor complaint.  Secondly, the TV arrived in perfect shape from a shipper who used a local guy to do the final delivery.  He was nice enough to help me into the house with this TV which only weighed, with packaging, 85 pounds or so.  And don't forget - shipping was FREE!Amazon's price is remarkable.  The TV is still over $300 more at my local retailers.  Only minor problem was I had to wait for the TV but Amazon made this clear at the outset.  Now I understand they are in stock.The picture is the best of all the TV's I compared it to.  The brightest with the absolute best colors.  Only one minor complaint:  The viewing angles are not quite as good as the LCD flat panel.  But the TV is about $1000 less than a comparable LCD flat panel and honestly I can live with  this minor issue.  My friends and my kids friends are absolutely amazed at the picture quality this TV produces.  I use a terrestrial antenna which gives the best picture possible.Now, for why I didn't choose the other contenders.  The plasma suffers from burn in and fades over time so I ruled it out.  The LCD was more expensive with no appreciably better picture, in fact I found the DLP image crisper, brighter and more colorful.  This 1080p DLP just seemed to be the best value for the money with a breathtaking picture.  That being said, when the LCD flat panel comes down in price I will definitely get one because I just love the form factor.I's strongly recommend this TV and Amazon.  You are not going to find it cheaper anywhere.  I hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine.", "Date": "September 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Result of 5 months of careful research", "Author": "Mike S. \"Professor\"", "ReviewID": "R223TDBNP6GGQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me say that I am not in a place in life where I feel the need to justify a purchase and subsequent expenditure to the world at large via a review. If I felt I have made a mistake of sorts, I would warn other technical soujourners to heed my call and avoid the jagged rocks that ended my High-Def exploration. That being said, this Samsung will blow you away.  I spent at least 5 months going between technologies..Plasma-vs.LCD-vs. LCD projection-vs.DLP.  When I saw this set in the 60\" at Best Buy I was impressed..but not over Plasma.  But using a HD Tv for movies and Xbox primarily...I went with DLP for the 'no-fear' factor of burn-in issues, color and longevity. Looking at Plasma sets change pictures...I could see 'ghost' images left over from the second before..and LCD screen-door effects are noticable to me. I don't get it...I have always been hyper-alert to details and just KNEW I would be the type that would 'see' things that others can live with...but will drive me slowly insane over time..leaving me rocking and mumbling alone on the florr with my medications in years to come. Anyway...I liked the fact the the only thing that will decay on a DLP is the bulb...and once replaced, the set is a good as new year after year..as opposed to LCD and Plasma reality that things will dim over time...maybe a lot of time..but they will. Okay..High-def decisions made. Sweaty hands clutch the charge card and press in the numbers on line. Done. (PS..I compared prices between 30 storres across the USA. Amazon beat them all with no tax/no shipping. Many chains will SAY no shipping cost....but then just ask about getting a call to alert you your order is coming..and you have to upgrade your shipping...for another $200. Amazon offers TRUE no-cost shipping with white-glove service whichin means a courtesy call so you can meet the delivery at your home)Set arrived and it was lighter in weightthan expected. Unpacked and the finish is incredible...the look is very clean. Read the manual...and understand the picture modes...movie-dynamic-std-custom. With the unit on..the bulb takes about 45 seconds to achieve full brightness. The picture was bright but harsh...the reason was it came on dynamic setting and with a test-DVD movie in..it seemed very high in contrast. I read and dicovered that there are several quick-chioces for room light..and that standard or movie would be best...switched and it was incredible. I also bought a Sony HDMI upconvert DVD player from Amazon...and a HDMI cable from another vendor on the internet. PS...listen to previous posts about cable costs. In the 'old' world of analog..Monster cables are great...and gold connectors, cable braiding, etc makes some difference in the qualnity of electrons getting from point a to point b. But this is digital. Digital o's and 1's either 'get' to their destination or they do not. If there is a connection...it is either 'on' or 'off'. So any cable will work...a $15 dollar HDMI cable will transfer digial info as well as a $125 cable. That is reality.Okay, so now that I discovered the quick buttons for screen brightness and also picture size...I was on the move...learning more. The menu is VERY easy and fun to use. Xbox 360 is scary beautiful....movies are stunning and you cannot believe the color and crisp picture. IT is mesmerizing and hypnotic. I bouth a HD antenna ($38) at Best Buy becaue I am not ready to get a cable package yet. The search function scans and finds all local channels..thenyou can go back an erase all you don't want. PBS is brodcast in HD here and the picture even with a cheap antenna over the air is GORGEOUS! Fox sports also brodcasts in widescreen...720i and its beautiful. Amazing.The USB port on the side finds a jump drive quickly on the 'wiselink' setting and you can show groups your pictures in a slide show faship or one-by-one...its so awesome. The PC connection works well and you now have a 50\" PC monitor in HD.I am so jazzed about this Samsung and the new DLP technology. I have friends over who say the color is so bright...so vivid..they were thinking Plasma, but will get this set now. Side-fade is not and issue..you can see the picture in even brighter room light from many angles. And Xbox 360 people...you will passout at the color. Once you go into your game console, set up the High Def setting on Xbox, and on the Samsung set the 'game mode' on. These settings will now be remembered when you turn the game on and select 'Game console' setting on the Samsung's input options. Game detail, color and clarity will take your breath away. Promise. And no burn in worry.....ever.I simly have a 3-way system for sound right now. Twin satellite speaker cubes and a sub-woofer. The Samsungs speakers are 'ok'....but you will want great sound. I simply have a stereo setup for now until I eventually get a surround sound something. (sigh....more research)This Samsung will be the best decision you could make in a technology catagory and you will not be dissapointed. You will need to read the guide (easy to follow) to understand screen brightness quick choice options and other features so you can maximize this amazing devices abilites....but thats only 30 minutes out of your life. Well worth it!  This set will simply blow you away...ever if you are a detail-freak like me who has come to be less-than-impressed with most promises in life...this Samsung truely exceeds everything you thought possible.", "Date": "October 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Love our Smasung 1080p DLP HDTV", "Author": "B. Schneider", "ReviewID": "R9B3WF1K8WMH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "December 6th up-date: TV is still working wonderfully.  We noticed a number of folks commented about a slight fan hum.  We thought we would clarify our comment as to not hearing the lamp fan what-so-ever.  We have an inset area for the unit built into the wall (so the unit is flush w/ the wall).  Perhaps this is the reason we don't hear any fan noise even with the volume very low (yes, the fan is working...).  One other thing, we mentioned a free mp3 player & NFL gift certificate and I've checked and these are no longer available (though Samsung will probably offer something else soon).  Good luck w/ your HDTV shopping.  This one should be high on your consideration list.Original review: We are thoroughly enjoying this TV.  Finally up-graded from a Sony 27 inch standard TV and are really happy with our decision to go with this HDTV.  We had waited and waited as we wanted to technology to overcome a number of issues before buying.  These were as follows (for DLP): \"rainbow\" effect, image problems (artifacts) w/ fast moving scenes, inconsistent colors, poor black levels, and loud lamp fan.  The 7th generation DPL's spin the color wheel so fast (14,400 rpm's) that \"rainbow\" effect issues are pretty well history.  This, along with improved processors, has all but eliminated artifacts in fast moving scenery.  The colors are great and extremely natural (helped by a new 5 segment color wheel).  The 10,000 to 1 contract ratio produces outstanding black levels.  Finally, we are not able to hear the lamp fan what-so-ever.Also, we had wanted to wait for 1080p technology.  Though it is not being utilized too much now, it will be in the future.  Another great plus in waiting is HDMI technology is now becoming standard on HDTV's and it is an important feature to get the most out of an HDTV.  LCD and Plasmas have had their list of issues too which have been largely overcome.  One could make effective arguments for these technologies also.  However, after a lot of research, we confidently felt that that this HDTV is the best value for the money.  You WILL pay more to get a LCD or Plasma 1080p HDTV with this good of a picture.Our decision had basically come down to two models, this one and Sony's 50 inch SXRD (another LCD technology).  These two units deliver basically \"perfect\" pictures (if you search the web, you'll find that many other people boiled it down to these two units too).  If both units were the same price, we probably would have gone with the Sony (though it is splitting hairs).  However, the Sony would have been $350 more to get from a reliable on-line source and Samsung was also including a free $100 MP3 player and $100 NFL gift shop certificate (makes it a $550 difference).While we don't like the idea of replacing the lamp every two years or so ($200 each time), we do like that a DLP will basically perform as new when changing the lamp (the material that makes up LCD's and Plasmas can degrade over time though not too much of an issue anymore).  Projection LCD's (and SXRD's) have a lamp that will need replaced too.  The good news is that technology is solving the lamp issue also by replacing the projection bulb with LED lights (LED also will totally eliminate rainbow possiblity).  However, right now it is TOO expensive and we were tired of waiting to buy a HDTV (see Samsung's LED DLP).Point is, a lot of people that bought an HDTV one to three years ago will be looking to buy another one soon when they see the recent considerable improvements.  We are hoping that we'll feel good about what we see in front of us for the next 10 years (and think we will as the picture is outstanding).  We believe our next HDTV will be a SED by Toshiba / Canon which is a technology just starting to be massed produced (far superior to DLP, LCD & Plasma - look it up on the web).  By the time we up-grade from this unit, SED's will be cheap (or maybe some other technology just as good).  Final comment - NO problem with shipping as we know this is a concern for a lot of people.", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Buy this TV.  Here is WHY....", "Author": "Jason Moon", "ReviewID": "R2I5FK3ALKIUXD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for an excellent 1080p big screen but don't want to shell out close to 3 grand, then this is the TV for you.  I did EXTENSIVE research before finally settling on this model.  I compared it to the Sony SXRD's, the mitsubishi 1080p's, and many others.  None could compete with the total package that Samsung offers.  The picture on this TV is amazing and if you are new to HD, then I guarantee it will blow you away.  Right now I think that DLP's like this one get you by far the best picture for your money.  LCD's and Plasma's can certainly compete, but only if you are willing to put up between 3 and 5 grand for your set.  If you try to pick up an LCD or Plasma in this price range, you're probably going to see inaccurate colors, washed out blacks, and you'll never see full 1080p resolution.  Settling on this particular set wasn't really that difficult once I'd thoroughly examined the competition.  The Sony SXRD's have an equally fantastic picture, and plenty of inputs and features, but they run you about 400 to 500 more for the same screen size.  They even lack an important feature in that although they also display a native 1080p resolution, they can't accept a 1080p signal through HDMI, which means your Bluray/HDDVD/PS3 will have to send a 1080i signal to get upconverted (2005 SXRD's only, the 2k6 SXRD's have this feature but will cost you an additional 300-500 bucks).The outward design of this model also shames the competition.  It has by far the smallest cabinet of any 50\" DLP that I've seen, taking up the absolute minimum in space.  Although it isn't totally flat like an LCD or Plasma, you will be amazed at how slim this TV really is (barely a foot deep).  My 1998 Sony VVega 27\" CRT is at least twice this deep, not to mention about twice as heavy and almost as wide!  This is because Samsung designed the set with hidden speakers underneath the screen and a glossy 3/4 inch framing on the outside and top edges.  This is a cleverly designed and darn slick looking set, believe me.  The only reason to pass up on this TV is if you are absolutely set on having the completely flat cabinet that you can hang on the wall and whatnot.  If this is the case then DLP technology is not for you, and I would recommend the Sony Bravia line(much more expensive).  But if you are a real videophile like me and want the absolute best picture for your money, then stop searching, you have found your set.As a sidenote, the service from Amazon was superb.  They shipped it for free and had it delivered even sooner than I expected.  The price was also about $0.00 cheaper than at Circuit City, so this was a no brainer purchase from Amazon.", "Date": "November 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV!

Beautiful picture that holds it own with plasma/lcdfor me comparing in the stores.  Excellent brightness,sharp, no banding, deep blacks.  I only watch 1080i OTAand upconverted DVD ( Samsung DVD-HD960 ) but I'm verypleased.  Looking forward to the end of the BluRay/HDbattle for 1080p.  My neighbors are floored.2.  I've not seen rainbows in a month of viewing. Note,I have seen these on projecter units so I have beenlooking for this effect.3.  Good viewing angle even at 45 degrees.4.  HD Off The Air tuner the best of 4 units I've usedbuilt in.  I'm big on broadcast HD as I hate paying forcable.  Very sensitive - more channels5.  I am very price sensitive and Amazon had a price inthe $1750 range.  That let me add the standard DVD playerthat upconverts my current dvds ( mixed bag - some discsbetter then others but does improve sharpness for sure. )to 1080p for $1905 total!6.  Picture/music player from files on usb key connectedstorage.7.  Many inputs - Connect 2 hdmi,vga,2 component, two rfin, many video/svga.8.  Replacable bulb seems like the best maintenanceoption in HDTV.Minor Cons:1.  Something when I start the DVD-HD960 and 5087 canlock up over HDMI about one in ten times.  Turning bothoff and on clears.  Once both are up I haven't seen anydropped connection problems.2.  The remote could be more responsive - seems like buttonpresses can be missed if they are short.  The remotegrouping might be improved.3.  Not cablecard capable - not a problem for me but ifyou are looking for hdtv from cable you need this - lookat the 5088/5688 etc.4.  Warmup of bulb - about 10 seconds - not a problemfor me.5.  Not as slim as plasma but was acceptable to mywife especially at the price.6.  Took Amazon awhile to get these units in stock -looks in stock now.Very happy - I throughly recommend.Added note - reading the reviews I think a valid point is made that you need to make sure the shipped set is ok.  My experience was the free shipper was willing to unbox, help me set on stand - It's quite light, and power up and connect.  So I felt quite good about the set before the shipper was out the door - of course I had my antenna, dvd , and stand ready to go...  Make sure you do this 'due diligence' and you can beat the heck out price of most electronics stores with confidence.

Franks", "ReviewID": "R3CIUE17KKS6QI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did extensive research on HDTV for a couple months, and eventually ended up with a list of 10 TV's ranging 42-50\" (all DLP or LCD) in my price range.  I researched those TV's online and went to look at them in local stores.  Most stores show their expensive sets playing a native 1080p Blue Ray movie via HDMI, and their less expensive on a split signal HD or SD channel.  It can fool people into thinking the less expensive TVs don't look as good!This TV exceeded the others with good reviews and bang for the buck.  It almost seemed unreal.  A 50\" Samsung 1080p DLP HDTV for $1500?  Get out of here!  That is too good to be true.  Or is it?  I took the plunge and ordered it on Amazon through J & R Music and Computer world for $1500.  I couldn't get free shipping so I ended up paying $1700 total shipped.  I looked back later and found I could have gotten free shipping with a free Amazon prime trial membership, but I was too late.  Oh well...I still saved $400 over buying it from a local store, so I'm happy.The TV arrived exactly 7 days after I placed the order.  The delivery guys carried it into my house and took it out of the box.  They let me inspect for damages, but would not let me plug it in or turn it on.  I did that right after they left, and it was fine.  I had no HD content except my Xbox 360.  I popped in Gears of War at 1080i (TV de-interlaces the signal to 1080p automatically) and turned on \"Game Mode\".  I feel the Game Mode should be under the Picture/Display section in the menu instead of \"Settings\" since it is a display feature...but it's not a big deal.  It wasn't hard to find.  Gears of War brought a tear to my eye.  I couldn't believe it.  I actually laughed while playing thinking \"Is this really happening?  My TV can do this?\"  It was unreal how good the game looked.  I downloaded some HD content through Xbox Live to see how HD movies will look.  I watched some 720P trailers and they looked great.  I was very happy.I had my DirecTV satellite upgraded and got HD channels a week after receiving the TV.  I can't even begin to tell you how good Discovery HD looks on this TV.  It's breathtaking.  It looks like everything is really in my living room.  The other HD channels like ESPN, HBO, etc look really good too.  You can easily tell some of the HD channels play native 720P or 1080i, while others crop and up-convert.  The cropped/up-converted stuff still looks really good.Pros / things I likeThe menus are easy to navigateIt up-converts every native signal to 1080p (does a great job with most stuff)It has 0 lag with video games in Game Mode - it's not even bad in regular modeThe fan is quietThe whites are bright, the blacks are darkHD video looks very sharp, comparable to the expensive TV sets480i/p DVDs look very good, and it up-converts them VERY wellThe virtual surround sound is goodThe black glossy case looks great, and doesn't have a glare problem in my living roomExtensive ways of adjusting the picture look and individual colorsVery lightweight (if you have to move it for whatever reason)Many inputs for various thingsCute little beeping song when you turn it on or offNo rainbowingCHEAP PRICE!!Cons / things I dislikeI have one complaint.  I cannot get SD Satellite broadcasts to look good on this set.  Like I said DVD's look great though (so all 480i/p doesn't look horrible).  I've tried everything from making adjustments to the TV picture, cable box settings, trying composite, component, S-Video, HDMI, etc. to no avail.  I've researched the problem online and found it's a common problem people have with DLP sets.  Others who watch my TV think its SD broadcasting looks fine, but I have a good eye and I say it doesn't.  My Mom has a 55\" Mitsubishi CRT RPTV and her SD broadcasting looks much better, while my HD looks much better ;)  It's no big deal.  In 2007 more Satellites are being launched to provide more HD channels (no set date yet).  DirecTV says they will have 130 HD channels.  I didn't buy this TV for SD...I bought it for HD and it does its job very well.In conclusion...if you are in the market for a 50\" HDTV that works great for HD gaming, DVDs, HD video content, and you want to spend $1500 on it, this is your set!

I recommend going to a retail store and comparing the models that you are interested in. For the price and quality the Samsung was my top choice. If not for the price the new Sony bravia LCD is the best picture quality that I saw. I ordered it through Amazon (not one of the vendors). There was no tax and no shipping fee (I selected the faster choice of shipping and still no shipping fee). The TV was in perfect condition when it arrived. The delivery guys took it out of the box and let me take a look at it for external damage. They informed me that if it did not turn on or if something else was wrong internally that I would have to contact Amazon. I bought 2 HDMI (Cables to go) cables from Amazon and they work great. I have Dish Network and spoke to technical support and asked about expensive cables; $150 Monster vs. $15 Cables to go and he informed me that they get a lot of calls about picture quality and one of the first things they ask the customer is if they have Monster HDMI cables. The tech informed me that the more expensive cables pick up and magnify the noise that is in the signal. He said that the other cables have a clear picture and do not pick up this noise. So for the picture has been great. My neighbor has Monster cables for his 1080p 57 inch and I can't see that his is any better. There is plenty of information online about this topic and most of it points to Monster cables being money down the drain.  I also picked up the sony dvd hd up converter player and am very satisfied with it. I went ahead an got a line conditioner (about 115 bucks from Amazon).

The quality of the picture was nearly the same with an HD signal, but when you play a DVD or watch non-HD TV the DNIE feature really makes a difference. I also found the Samsung to be able to achieve brightness higher then the Sony. The audio is ok. I have read other reviews that state it is bad. It's not great, but it is fine and you can adjust it custom with the 5 band equalizer in the menu. However I recommend you hook the optical out to your stereo and enjoy the true HD in Dolby Digital.  The only con is the preset for the picture. It took me nearly 2 weeks to adjust the color, contrast, and brightness. But it is well worth it now. I actually discovered the picture to be to bright! Being able to reduce each of the six colors individually is also a plus.  As for Amazon the price of course was great. When I purchased it delivery was estimated from 10 to 20 days out.

The sound quality of the set is excellent; I am speaking of a non-audiophile of course.The main reason I purchased this TV was because it was 1080p ready and it was a DLP unit.  I like that I am able to replace the bulb system when it fails.  I did not like the idea of throwing away a plasma or LCD TV when its screen failed.  The owner's manual has instructions for replacing the bulb.If you need to connect a component, you should be able to.  The component/HDMI/Coax/USB connections are great and user friendly.  The TV menu is easy to navigate and is user friendly.My only concern about purchasing this product on Amazon was the \"Freight\" shipping.  Eagle Freight was AWESOME.  The gentleman brought it into the house and helped me set it up and turn it on.  The box had no dings, dents for punctures.Pro:  Excellent Picture and Sound Quality.  Slim profile for a rear projection TV.  Beautiful appearance of TV's exterior.  FREE SPEEDY AND PROFESSIONAL SHIPPINGCon:  NoneRecommendation:  Connect this TV to an HD antenna.  You will be amazed at what your local channels are broadcasting in HD over the air.  Our local PBS station is broadcasting 4 channels in HD.  Cox Cable only carries 1.  The local NBC, ABC and FOX affiliates broadcast 24 hour weather programming in addition to regular programming, again, this is not broadcast by Cox Cable.", "Date": "November 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "We Love This TV!!", "Author": "Bookworm \"Mary\"", "ReviewID": "R3PZC7LBLJGXNW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After also researching for over a month on various types of tv's (LCD, Plasma, Rear Projection) we settled on rear projection.

Lots more bang for your buck.  Amazon had a great price, I had a discount coupon, the deal was done.  Well, let me tell you how very pleased we are.  I will not spout tech info that I know nothing about but rather tell you as an average consumer, this purchase was effortless from start to finish.  Delivered in 1 week, delivery company used in my area was spectacular and set up was done as well.  One flaw...back panel of tv was not set in properly resulting in 3 plastic tabs sticking out from side.  We called Amazon customer service, recieved prompt and curteous attention, matter resolved instantly.  That very night, price went down $130.  I called customer service again and within minutes, a price difference refund was issued to my charge card.  Outstanding!!!Now, about the tv itself.  What can I say?  It's gorgeous!  The picture is phenomenal and yes, sound isn't the most perfect but we listened to quite a few out there and the Samsung had the best clarity and we think it's just fine.

The colors are absolutely spectacular. Rich, vivid greens and blues, blacker than black, and bright whites. The cabinet is pretty slick too and will definitely compliment any room you decide to place it in.I will say, that out of the box, the picture needs some work. You will need to do some tuning to dial in the tint, contrast, brightness, and saturation. The default \"dynamic,\" \"standard,\" and \"movie\" settings don't really do it justice. You can adjust the picture settings for each input. In other words you can have different settings for your DVD player and your HDTV box. I would recommend getting a calibration disc to take full advantage of the capability of this HDTV. It's well worth the 20 or 30 bucks for the disc.Shortly after I purchased this set, I picked up a Toshiba HD-DVD player. The picture and sound both are nothing short of Fantastic. Stunning, detailed images and deep, rich sound in 5.1. HD cable is just as impressive on this display.Another thing I like about this model is the user-menu. A slick \"windowsish\" type menu with adjustable transparency, and it's very easy to see exactly what your adjustments to contrast, saturation, etc... are doing to the picture. Another nice feature in the menu is the Digital Noise Reduction switch. I usually leave it turned off for high quality digital sources, but I find that it does wonders for some older standard definition DVDs and some standard definition tv channels.With standard ground shipping, Amazon had this TV in my living room in 7 days. The carrier brought it inside, unboxed it so I could inspect it for damage, and hauled away the packaging. That's what I call customer service.

They were friendly and informed me that I'll be covered by the warranty and they transferred my call to someone local in Houston to do the repair.  Even though the blinking lights indicated the lamp needed to be replaced, the repair person said they would order a new lamp and a new light/dlp engine just in case it's not just the lamp.  BTW, I had read somewhere that the lamp should last on average 3.5 years.The repairman came the following Friday and ended up replacing both the lamp and the dlp engine.  He said we practically had a new TV.  Also my 4 year old nephew had scratched the screen with his plastic light saber.  It scratches very easily, and I asked the repairman how much would it cost to repair it (not covered under warranty).

Here in Virginia visiting family, I was looking at the Best Buy ads in the Sunday paper and they are trying so hard to get rid of all of the 720p TV's but for the price you could get a 1080p set for. It was mind-blowing. But because some people probably dont know that 1080p is the best quality, Im sure they are selling.I live in Alaska and it took me forever to to find a retailer to ship me this TV. Amazon could not ship it to me because of the deminsions. I did however buy the stand for it from Amazon and what a beautiful combo they both are. Very roomy and very sturdy. Easy to assymble.In closing, if you live in the lower 48, buy this TV from A-Zon. Even if you paid $150-$200 for shipping, you would still beat most Best Buy/ C.C. prices buy a longshot. I love this TV and so does my wife.

I was sceptical, but the price was so much better on this set so we went for it. Now I think we made a great choice- the picture is very clear, and the colors are phenomenal. Viewing angle is also very good for projection. Everything is intuitive to use on the set, but if you need it, the instruction manual is very clear and concise. No complaints about switching between the hdmi sources, as another reviewer had commented- maybe they fixed that problem. I do have three suggestions for those interested in buying this tv: 1)Buy it- the picture is stunning, the price is right, and you won't be disappointed! 2)Free shipping = Eagle Transport = bad. They called us to arrange delivery between 12pm-5pm, so we took off work to make sure someone was home that afternoon. In the morning they called and told us it was out on a truck and on its way. When it did not arrive by 5:30pm we called and were then told that it just left the dock and would be here in an hour. We waited another 2.5 hours. Better late than never I guess, considering the other horror stories I read about Eagle- but we wasted an afternoon off from work for nothing, which I do not appreciate. 3) Use good cables. At first we were horrified that something was wrong with the tv- everything on tv was dull gold, green and blue. After much panicking and testing other inputs that looked perfect, we found out the cable we received with our new hd cablebox was bad. We upgraded the cable from the cable box to a dvi-to-hdmi cable and voila- beautiful color.

The salesman assured me that the set had been gone over thoroughly before it was put back on sale.When the Television was delivered the picture was stunning, and I was very pleased with my purchase.  After a few days, however, the picture arbitrarily began switching from 4:3 to 16:9 aspect ratio.  This would happen every half hour to 45 minutes.  Not a big deal but annoying to say the least.  Instead of returning the set under the store's 30 day return policy, I had them send a service technician out to see what could be done.  He scratched his head and said he'd have to do a little research, and would get back to me in a day or so.  About a week later, with no further contact with the technician, the set developed a new problem - it would cut off every once in a while.  At that point, I had had enough of this dog and sent it back to the store.  However, I wasn't ready to give up on Samsung and their bright and beautiful DLP picture.

After making the pruchase I think I still would have prefered the Samsung 1080p 46\" lcd, because I like the slim design, however my wallet didn't (I'm a student).  So I guess I settled with the DLP but I am very happy with my choice!I ordered it about 2 weeks ago and it came this past Thursday morning at 8am via EGL.  So the ship time was fairly quick for a product this large and coming from CA to PA (also free shipping).  The PQ is truly amazing, I do not have HD cable, but I do game yet I still don't have anything that will preform above 480p.  Regardless I wanted to see how some of my Final Fantasy games looked on this tv only at 480i (ps2 component).  Final Fantasy always seems to have amazing CGI movies so this would be a good test to see what the TV could do at a lower native resolution.  I nearly crapped my pants when I watched the intro movie to Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Cerberus and Final Fantasy XI looked just as amazing.  The next item on the list was Advent Children which looked insanely amazing.  I seriously can't wait to get a 360 or PS3 an watch a movie in either bluray or HD format and have Batman in my freaking living room!  I would tell anyone who has been going back and forth with their choice of a HDTV to seriously give DLP and this model a favorable chance.  You really can't be the price and the size of the screen and resolution is such a bang for the buck.  However if you still wanted to wait and want a slimmer HDTV. Samsung will be releasing wall mountable DLPs this spring, but I'm sure their price tag will surely fit their new features at 2500+.  In the end, if you choose to wait you'll never get a HDTV.

I've had this TV for about 2 months now, and for most of that time I used it without even utilizing it's HD capabilities and the thing is still very very sexy. Just regular DVD's and last gen systems (ps2, gamecube specifically) all look great and the picture quality is really top notch. Having also just recently gotten my hands on a ps3 and utilizing the tv's HDMI connector and playing games in 1080p resolution I am now beyond a shadow of a doubt certain that I made a great purchase. I can't imagine where else one can find so large a tv with all the things included for such a great price. To that end, it must also be mentioned that as this TV is a DLP tv, this particular brand shares the same problem that all (many?) other DLP's have which is to say the viewing range is somewhat limited. If one views the tv from an angle thats too high or too wide, the picture becomes very dark and it can be nearly impossible to view the picture. The range on this TV is I think a little better than others just because of how large the screen is but if you're planning on entertaining a party of 15 for superbowl just be sure to test the seating to make sure the picture isn't too dark.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great price for the quality of this TV", "Author": "Albert Castro", "ReviewID": "R1GVFGZOETK2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not much of a tech head but I did my share of research and price shopping.

I'm picky about this stuff, so making a decision wasn't easy...in fact it took 2 months.  After talking and reading reviews, I decided that DLP was the best bang for the buck and after finding this gem on amazon and finding that it's MUCH pricer elsewhere....like crutchfield...bestbuy....etc., I decided to get it.  I just got it today, fresh with new HD cable and xbox360.  Holy [...].  What a beautiful picture.  Samsung did a wonderful job with this TV.  The only gripes (and they're small) that I have are that the remote isn't anything stellar and the speakers could be a little stronger in the lower end, but it's hooked up to a surround sound system, so I really can't complain.  The inputs on the back are very well labled and HDMI works great.  Another HUGE selling point about this TV is the fact that 1080p doesn't exist yet.  1080i is the best out there right now, which means that this TV is a good investment for the future.  Also, in case you might not know, DLP TVs have bulbs you have to replace...about [...] or so from ebay....every 3-5 years or more.  This is good because it means that after you put in a new bulb, you have a new TV.  LCDs and plasmas eventually just burn out and you're left with nothing.  Seriously, get this TV.

Last fall, this 50 inch DLP from Samsung sounded like the way to go.  Good reviews, affordable, new color wheel, 1080p (future proof), no risk of burn in, etc.Went ahead and bought it in May.  I was disappointed.  SDTV simply looks god awful on this thing.  Sharpness, color, you name it, it looks way out of whack.  Grainy, dull, ugly.  And let's face it, there's still a lot of SDTV to be watched out there.  Also, rainbowing not totally fixed like product description claimed.  Worst of all, quality control issues at Samsung.  My set (bought at a brick and mortar) had these watermark like stains running along the top and bottom of the screen.  Read a lot about this on other sites, as well as faulty light engines burning out after just several months.Ended up returning and going w/ the new 50 inch plasma from Panasonic.  That set rocks!  SDTV looks far better, not so boxy of a set, only a little higher price tag.  The trade off is 1080p.  The Panny doesn't have it.  But before all you out there start thinking of 1080p as the second coming, I suggest you do a little research into noticeable difference in 1080p, screen size and viewing distance.  Unless you're an avid gamer (I'm not) or like to sit 5 feet from your 50 inch screen, it might not be so special after all.As far at the Samsung again, HDTV looked very good, but not as good as the plasma.

Still, at that price I was willing to wait.After about a week, I received notice that my package was en route and would be here in a few days. On the day that it was to arrive however, I was informed that the package couldn't be transferred from shipper to shipper. Apparently the carrier who would deliver the TV to my door wouldn't accept it due to the fact that there was the sound of broken glass in the box.I contacted Amazon to tell them that I would be willing to wait for a replacement, but I would like to have it expedited. I was told that wouldn't be a problem, and I was informed that my request would have to go to another department. I was told that I would be contacted by the end of the day.Four days later, after not having heard back, I called Amazon. I was informed that the only shipping choice I had available was the specialty shipper, and that there was no possibility of expediting the packaging. It would arrive in 5 to 10 business days.At this point the wait for the television was getting too long, so I asked to cancel the order. I was sent an e-mail two days later stating that all of the e-mails that I had been sending were missed, and they asked if I would like to proceed or cancel. It was at this point when I called in and made it quite clear that I wanted this nightmarish business finished and that they should cancel the order immediately.It's now more than three and a half weeks since my card was charged and several angry conversations later -- I don't have a TV and I don't have a refund. The order details online state that the unit was successfully delivered to a city 70 miles away from me, and there is no sign that I've initiated a return.
