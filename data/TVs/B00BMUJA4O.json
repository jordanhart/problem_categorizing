{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent LED HDTV on a Budget", "Author": "J. Bakker", "ReviewID": "RQLH48A29HND0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We live on a tight budget, and until early August, had never purchased a television in our lives - over 30 years!  In order to finance a new television, we pulled the plug on satellite service in February and started saving.  The savings added up quickly, and we wanted to make sure we had something ready to go for watching NFL football in the fall (hey...some people watch Dr. Phil, we're football people...).We hooked this up to a cheap RCA outdoor HD antenna and have been impressed out of the box with the picture quality (we live in a rural area) over the air.  1080i or 720p for all the local channels which we can access (CBS, FOX, and PBS).  I'm hoping, in a few months, to save enough for a better antenna array to pick up ABC and NBC as well.  The towers for NBC and ABC are about 55-60 miles away, but they are in the same direction.  Hopefully a better arrangement will work.Hooked up to the Blu-ray player (Sony's best from 3 years ago), it displays HD television superbly.  Bright colors, dark blacks, extremely good detail.  The only complaint would be minor artifacts/pixellation during intense screen activity sequences.  I'm not sure if it's the basic HDMI cable I use to hook up the Blu-ray player or the extent of the television's capabilities.  I've ordered a higher quality HDMI cable and we will see how it does.I don't use the built-in speakers much (I have a home theater receiver that sounds better than any built-in speakers on any television could), but they are certainly serviceable, and much more powerful, clear, and balanced than I expected.The rest of the features on the TV are up to par; I haven't yet tried the Roku streaming stick and am researching it.  With our Blu-ray player already capable of playing Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other video-on-demand sources, I'll have to check and see if it is worth buying.Overall, the television is a four star unit - not too big, not the greatest sound, and not the greatest picture during intense on-screen activity, but when you factor in the price it pushes it over the top and makes this a five-star television.  With this unit you get more than what you bargained for, in a good way!  Enjoy!", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice picture", "Author": "Robin P.

Picture is good. Sound good which is why I like Hitachi. Some of these new tv's have sound systems which are not to my liking. Sound on a tv I have the hissing is terrible and I can't stand listening to it. The popular brand customer support was no help. Equalizer did not fix the problem. Hitachi is nice to listen to. No problem. Picture good. I bought a 40\". Do not like bigger tv's. My grandson has a 46\" hitachi and loves it. He might buy 70\" Hitachi for Super Bowl", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "patrice priebe", "ReviewID": "R2VSDGPD51FJG4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband and I really enjoy watching our shows on this TV.  The picture is clear and the colors are vibrant. It did take a little bit of fine tuning, but I think that is true with any new television you buy.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "The only 42\" with 4 HDMI and supprts Roku Stick tool", "Author": "WZRD", "ReviewID": "RAM8RAWO7OVHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I had a 32\" Toshiba at my office for a few years with 2 HDMI ports, which are not enough, 1  for cable box one for Blu-Ray player, then disconnected to use it for Google Chrome. Sick of switching back and forth. I purchased this because of the specs and the price, paid $340 shipped, the good surprise is the picture look awesome too after a small tweak. My other LED TV is a 70\" Sharp, which in my opinion, this one looks better. The picture is much fuller than LG and the other weird brands like Funai etcWith 4 HDMI, I am also getting a Roku stick for the heck of it! I connected it to my Vizio Sound bar and, very happy.Buy it if you find a good deal.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "120Hz 1080p Perfected (1920 x 1080)\nThe Hitachi anti-glare screen eliminates reflections so you can enjoy your HDTV without unwanted distractions.\nDolby Digital offers high quality sound with HDTV broadcasts and other sources.\nThe high gloss black frame design with an Ultra-Modern take with the added Platinum overlay adds elegance and sophistication to any room.\nEnjoy Connected TV with Wi-Fi Built-in to the Streaming Stick.
