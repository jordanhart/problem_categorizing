The picture quality is very good but not the best I've seen.  I agree with other reviews it's a bit soft for my taste but it works well in the room it's in.  I'm not a gamer or a big sports fan so I haven't noticed any pixel lag.  It does a very good job with HD content.I wanted a monitor not an Internet appliance because I expected it to last many years.  It's hooked to an LG Blue Ray which is Internet capable and a TiVo.It was delivered in July and on Oct 2 it refuses to power up.  LG customer service was helpful on the phone but of course no service on the weekend as a matter of fact you can't even schedule service on the weekend.  And parts and labor warranty (2 years) does not include the $75 charge for \"diagnosing the problem\".I gave it 3 stars because a single failure on an electronic device is not a big deal.  I hope that after this repair it's reliable.  If not I'll report back.  I'm also curious how many other owners are experiencing issues like this.  I expect reliability from $1,000 products.Well 6 days later, it's fixed.  The local repair people (Videosonics Lab in Torrance - [...]) were great.  No charge, despite what the LG service people said.  They also said they have a lot of business repairing LG TVs,  they said Sony, Samsung and Sharp are much more reliable.My next TV probably won't be an LG.", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best deal for the price", "Author": "Stephane Lemire \"S.Lemire\"", "ReviewID": "R3V08F9SR5B70I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this set 2 weeks ago.

I'm sure the newer models may have all newer features but you will pay more when this flat screen shows a good clear picture sound, and easy to set up. I wanted to get the New LED LCD.

I was a little worried it wouldn't live up to my expectations not being LED and only 60hz but honestly the difference is not worth the money. I actually find the 120hz TVs to have an annoying home film look to them anyway when watching blu-rays. I have the new Apple TV connected to it along with my Xbox 360. I haven't noticed any ghosting yet like others have mentioned but I also haven't watched any blu-rays on it. High-def content on the Apple TV looks amazing. Also it's worth mentioning that the VGA port on this TV supports full 1080P resolution. This means you can hook up your old non-HDMI Xbox 360 and get full 1080P resolution using the xbox 360 VGA cable.
