{"Reviews": [{"Title": "80 inch, BUY THIS TV!", "Author": "Dirk Steel", "ReviewID": "R27NPUS5TS1S6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the 80 inch.  It is a big, heavy TV and I was by myself when it was delivered so I paid the deliverymen an extra twenty dollars to let me put the stand on the TV before they carried it into the house and to then place it on the cabinet it will sit on.  They were happy to get $20 for five extra minutes of work, but it was well worth it to me as I didn't want to try doing that myself and damaging the TV.I think that the best placement for this TV is so that the middle of the screen is at eye level when you are seated on your couch in the position in which you will be viewing.  Do NOT place it high on the wall; you will get a sore neck after awhile, you will lose the \"sweet spot\" of the picture and it will affect the 3D quality.I found the Vizio 80inch at Costco for $3,400 and it was on Amazon for $3,800. I called Amazon and asked if they would price match and they said they would. Costco was going to charge me for delivery also and Amazon said they would do it free.  The delivery was scheduled for three days after I ordered the TV but it didn't show up. I called Amazon to complain and they said they were sorry, gave me a $160.00 credit on my credit card for the inconvenience and then Amazon jumped on it hard to make sure I had a delivery the next day at a time that was convenient for me! Amazon matched the Costco price, gave me free delivery and I ended up getting $160 back!  That is about a $600 savings by going with Amazon.  I checked the Costco site just now and their price is up to $3,700, I got mine at a good time!I hooked up my cable box with hdmi, the PS3 with hdmi and ran an optical cable from the optical out of the TV to my sound-bar and everything is working well.When watching TV with my cable box, the channels that run 1080i look fantastic and the 720p looks great, no grain on 1080i but slight on 720p.I have had NO issues with the remote control.  After reading so many negative comments about the remote I almost went with a different TV, but so far so good.  The remote DOES have be aimed at the lower left corner of the TV, but how hard is that?  I actually like the remote.The manual is easy to find on the TV menu and easy to navigate with lots of pictures.  Although, if you have experience with all this kind of stuff, you probably won't really need it.I looked at some other reviews of picture settings and have been trying different ones.  I am currently using a Vizio option called, \"calibrated.\"  That one is working fine.  The TV is in a room that gets a lot of light during the day and there is NO problem.  The TV is good and bright and the picture is still great with light in the room, and when it is dark at night, it is fantastic.My PC is in the same room and I have it hooked up to the TV with an hdmi cable, and in \"computer\" mode the TV functions just like a second 1080p computer monitor.  I just start a movie, 2D or 3D on my PC and then \"slide\" it over to the TV, expand it to full screen, switch the sound to come out of the TV and enjoy!I ran some ripped Blu-Ray 3D movies from my PC, through my NVidia Titan card with hdmi, to the TV and it worked!  The 3D is GREAT!  It was as good or maybe even better than what I saw in the theatre.  I recommend this 3D!  My wife was way impressed!I like a big screen. I replaced a 73 inch DLP with this 80 inch. Don't listen to those web pages that tell you how far you need to sit away from your TV.  We sit about ten feet away from this TV and it is GREAT!  Clear, crisp, 3D is amazing,... my wife and I are so pleased.  It is like being at the movies!I put photos and videos of my young son on a thumbdrive and put it in one of the two USB ports.  The TV requires formatting in FAT32.  The TV then flashed a message asking if I wanted to access it. After that, it was easy to watch the photos and videos on the TV.  There are thumbnails of the photos but not the videos.  It was AMAZING to see the high quality photos and videos at 80 inches!  I plugged in a 1TB USB drive and it reads it just fine and I can look at the photos and videos with no problem.I tried the Smart TV part of the Vizio last night.  I accessed Youtube via the wi-fi connection.  It was easy, keyboard on the screen to enter names.  I requested that latest viral video \"The Fox\" because I had seen it in 1080 HD on my 30inch PC monitor.  It immediately started to play on the 80inch TV in 1080p PERFECTLY.  It was amazing to see it play over the wi-fi with no stuttering at all.  Very cool, but I really don't know how much of the Smart TV part of the Vizio I really will use.  However, the Smart TV menu is also where you access the USB ports if you have something plugged into them.Watching some cartoons with my son on the TV....WOW!  The Blu-Ray cartoons are freaking AMAZING. I don't know what to say.  Perfect colors, darn near life size figures.  I remember having about a 20 inch, black and white TV with a fuzzy picture and three channels when I grew up, and cartoons were only on Saturday mornings... have we come a long way.The first morning after I got the TV, when I turned it on there was a message saying the TV had received a software update over the Wi-Fi.This TV is fantastic!One thing I do wonder about, is why the biggest and most expensive Vizio comes with only four pair of 3D glasses and all the other ones come with eight?  Not that I need eight right now, but I do wonder.  I would think the 80inch might come with TEN! Right?@EDIT... I have had the TV for a little over a month now, and all is good.  I am very pleased with my choice and am enjoying the Vizio very much.  There is NO problem whatsoever with the remote.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "M801d Review - good but not great", "Author": "Tempest790", "ReviewID": "R279F6KKOGXA6Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking to replace my old 57\" CRT rear projection TV which has served me faithfully for years.  Wanted to upgrade to an 80 inch TV which limits choices a lot.  Basically, you have this or several Sharp models.  Samsung also makes 75 inch models too.I calibrated the TV using the Disney Wow blu-ray disc also purchased on Amazon which I heartily recommend to anyone to get a better picture quality.  It's really worth it!The smart dimming on this TV works good, but you will notice the LED's turning on an off as there is light bleed from the edge.  It does improve black levels significantly though, and letterbox movies will have a complete (and I mean complete) black bar that you cannot even see in a dark room.  Uneven full backlit dark screen look very bad though, so smart dimming will be a must.  Without it you will see white splotches from the uneven edge lit display.  That's not good unfortunately.While a full array backlit LED like the earlier Sharp models will be a better choice, I do like the passive 3D which is why I went with the Vizio.  Active 3D has too much crosstalk, and I knew I didn't want to go that route.  If you are not interested in 3D, then the Sharp models start a few hundred dollars cheaper than this Vizio.  Samsung also makes an edge lit display with micro dimming, and from what I've read and seen it seems the backlight bleed is very minimal compared to this TV.While there are some negatives to the TV, overall I am pleased.  80 inches makes a great viewing experience.  The panel appears to be a top notch IPS display with great viewing angles.  Colors are bright and vivid, and the TV can be easily calibrated to produce an excellent picture.  Most dark scenes and all bright scenes look fantastic with great contrast and color fidelity.  Gamma seems off though, and that may take professional calibration to modify.If you are on the fence, I would recommend the Vizio if you want to go with passive 3D or don't mind the blooming from the smart dimming (it really doesn't bother me that much).  If active 3D or no 3D at all is your preference, the Sharp and possibly Samsung will probably be the better choice.  I love the passive 3D on this TV.  It's like being at the theater.My calibrated setting below produced a fantastic picture:Backlight:  80Contrast:  78Brightness:  56Color:  39Tint:  -3Sharpness:  25All video processing like smooth motion, auto brightness off.Smart Dimming:  OnOverall, I do like the TV, but as other brands bring larger TV's to market, better options will probably be out there.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!!!!", "Author": "Faxon Bissett III", "ReviewID": "R2E5BIKKR9V87Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We just had this TV installed and we are blown away!!!!

This review can be applied unilaterally to any other Vizio, Sanyo, Olevia, Dynex etc etc.If you are a consumer whom expects to get 8+ years from your television and is a daily user of the product (2 hours or more a day), this brand, like many other lower name brands is not for you.With the exception of LG, SAMSUNG, and PANASONIC, ALL, again I repeat ALL other brands are manufactured by one large Chinese manufacturer named Foxconn. They make all the product panels for Apple as well.Plus: Low cost manufacturingMinus: TVs are soldered as one unit, and can never be serviced. They only use 10,000 to 20,000 hour capacitors that control the internal parts of the TV. For comparison, SAMSUNG uses 100,000 hour capacitors in their TVs. That is how Sony used to do it when they were a good manufacturer.This is the reason why a 80\" Vizio sells for the price range of a top of the line 65\" Samsung.I am sharing this information voluntarily because practically NO salesman in the big box stores will tell you this and honestly they probably just aren't educated enough to even know this information.Happy Shopping", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Julian Scates", "ReviewID": "R334HLCCI409PD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the 80\" version of this TV since late August so I have had some time to calibrate the picture and color settings.

Chapin", "ReviewID": "R90A8OZCRGB6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got a great deal through Amazon Prime that beat getting this from Costco by quite a bit. The shipping company (Pilot) did a great job delivering the TV on time and bringing it all the way to the basement of my house where they opened it up and plugged it in. i checked the TV over for damange and found none. I opted to keep the packaging. They test the TV upright in the box it came in, so you'll be installing the stand and putting it in its final resting place on your own.Initially the TV was overwhelmingly big and gave me a headache. I was very concerned that I had ordered a TV that was too big. Happily within about 4 days I got used to it and now enjoy the really big screen. I sit about 12 feet from it and enjoy the big picture. Do yourself a HUGE favor and check the review here where someone lists the settings he found on an AV forum to tune your TV's video settings. The settings that the TV is set to when it arrives are terrible. The settings are so bad, that you'll be very concerned about the quality of the TV. I found the video settings on a review here and it did MAGIC to how the TV display works. Add in about 10-15 hours of \"burn in\" time for the TV and the TV just gets better and better and better. The sharepness and HD for such a huge TV is awesome. Vizio packed an amazing amount of value into this set. Again, give your eyes a few days to get used to this size TV, and go to the review here that shows the right picture settings and you'll be SO HAPPY! The audio quality is pretty decent though I'll be getting a separate home theater sound system for this TV.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Took a risk that paid off.", "Author": "Miguel", "ReviewID": "R3W2E25S5MJVNH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is great.  I replaced a high-end 55\" Samsung TV bought from Amazon about a year and a half ago, and this has better image quality due to the smart dimming and better color settings that can be reached.It is a mammoth out of the box, so take a good 4 hours to install it if you're looking to put it on a wall.  Also, don't even consider doing it without help.From the front it looks fantastic and the thin bezel disappears when you're watching it.  From the side, the bezel does look a bit chubby at a tad under 2\".I do not use \"Smart\" features, but I do like that you can make them pop out from the bottom of the screen and scroll, it's better than entering a separate page.  We continue to get our online features through our Apple TV.The remote control is traditional, and all we use it for currently is turning the TV on and off.  I wish the TV would come with a wifi remote that did not demand true line of sight, or in lieu of this that the IR sensor on the set was more accessible.  I often have to press a button multiple times to get to what I want.Also note that only 4 sets of 3D glasses come with this set, if this is something that interests you.  I am curious to see if 3D pays off in 80\", it never did in 55\".Last but not least, make sure you have long-enough cables for HDMI and ethernet, and that your plug is nearby.

I knew that I wanted at least a 70\u201d to replace my old DLP 60\u201d I had in my living room.  I\u2019m glad I went with 80\u201d because it\u2019s the perfect size for my viewing distance of 12+ feet.The Samsung 8000 series was almost $3k more and I didn\u2019t see how it could cost so much more than the vizio.  The Samsung does have a camera, better apps, touch pad remote, etc but who needs that in a TV anyways?  My tivo does Netflix streaming, Pandora, etc already so I wasn\u2019t looking for a TV that had the same redundant features.  Why pay extra for it right?  This vizio does have Netflix and other streaming apps too so its not that its not \u201cloaded\u201d, its just not as polished as the samsung\u2019s.Right out of the box, the image was ok.  After calibrating it with W.O.W. Blu-ray disc, the picture became stunning.  If you\u2019re not familiar with WOW or avia discs, they are essentially test patterns so you can tweak your settings.  The colors are now accurate and the image is pretty dang sharp after an hour of calibration.The 3D is awesome and I can\u2019t believe why I have gone this long without this feature.  It may be a novelty but its sure awesome watching Avengers in 3D.  Just be sure that your receiver is 3D ready or have 3D pass through.  Found out the hard way that my receiver that\u2019s 6 years old doesn\u2019t support 3D so I have to run my 3d player (PS3) straight to the TV.  Luckily, the PS3 that I use as a player has an \u201coptical out\u201d so I was able to get the sound through the receiver still.  This version came with 4 3D glasses.  You can easily pick up more glasses online for about $4 each.I gave the speakers a 4 out of 5 rating.  Don\u2019t expect miracles with the built in speakers.  Highly recommend a good sound bar or surround sound system to complete the home theater setup.  You can\u2019t have a stunning image with tiny speakers.There are plenty of reviews on how bad the remote control is.  I would have to say that its not as bad as it seems.  Yes, you do have to point it at the bottom left corner of the screen.  Yes, you do have to be within 12feet to use it.  I just programmed my Tivo remote to turn the TV on so PROBLEM SOLVED.240hz aka Soap Opera effect.  This TV is a 240hz model.  Once the novelty of making people move very weird on screen, you can return back to 24fps by turning the \u201csmooth motion\u201d off.  Unfortunately, its buried in the menus.Was this worth another $1500+ over the Vizio 70\u201d?  You be the judge of that.  Other than the price, I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a 70\u201d+ TV.Pros:1. 3d is awesome.  Passive allows me to use cheaper glasses without batteries.2. Great color and black levels.3. Thin bezel4. Good amount of HDMI portsCons:1. Remote control (can be remedied with universal remote)2. Turning off 240hz is buried in the menus3. No buttons on TV to turn it off or change channels.

For larger sets, I've previously purchased LED back lit LCDs compared to edge lit (e.g., LNT5781F).  I wanted something larger than 57\" and back lit LCDs are not widely available these days.I compared several 70-75\" offerings from Samsung and Sony like the UN75F7100 and KDL-70R550A.  I went to Best Buy and HH Gregg and tried to do side-by-side comparisons as best I could.  Neither store would let me play my own content but I liked the picture on the Samsung UN75F7100 a bit better.  I then went to Costco and looked at the Vizio M 80\".  It surprised me how good it looked and for about $1,700 less than the UN75F7100 (at the time) for a larger screen.  The size difference also seemed significant to me.I decided to give it a try and I bought it at Amazon after price match at Sam's Club (which Amazon will still do on TVs).  Vizio had a $500 instant rebate at the time that stores seemed to implement differently.  Sam's factored it into the final price of $3288.  Amazon had it for $3799 and then gave a Prime discount of $500 after it was added to the cart.  Costco called it an \"instant rebate\" and had the price of $3,999. Therefore, after price match and Prime reduction, I got it for $2,788.00 + tax.Delivery was impressive and two people showed up and took it up 2 flights of stairs without issue.  The TV is a lot lighter than my 57\" Samsung from 2008.Performance seems very good since I hooked it up in October 2013.  Angles are good.  Passive 3D from blu-ray is very good.  The size is amazing.There is clouding that is apparent on most edge-lit sets and this is no different.  It is however well mitigated by one of Vizio's internal settings.The smart apps are nice and it has Amazon Prime video out-of-the box but I decided not to deal with the HDMI return channel to the receiver for surround sound so I just use the smart apps built into my blu-ray that has control via iOS and Android.There has been reports of poor IR reception with the stock remote.  The reception is probably fine but the IR receiver of the TV is *under* the bottom bezel on the left instead of on the front.  Your mileage may vary depending on how this is TV is mounted relative to your seating position.  For example, if the TV is mounted above your seating position (like above a fireplace) you will likely have no problem with the stock remote.  Regardless of placement, poor control via IR is completely mitigated by using a Harmony remote which likely has a stronger IR transmitter.There has also been some feedback about a lack of an on/off physical switch.  There is a multi function button but it is not easy to find or use.  It is unmarked and found on the rear, left side of the display about 1/4 of the way up and it needs to be depressed for about 5 seconds to power on the TV.  I would have preferred a touch sensitive switch on the bottom bezel of the TV but for everything else that this TV does well, I can live without a better on/off switch.One thing that I really would like to see is a Vizio iOS and/or Android app to control the major functions of this TV (and smart apps).

The colors in the LaserVue were amazing and the reds and greens exceeded any TV on the market. And the 75inch was the largest you could get at the time. So I waited and waited till the 80 inch showed up and the price became affordable. So after much reading I went with the Vizio M801d-A3 over the Sharp. The picture over all is better than my LaserVue, although the reds and greens are not as crisp. The Vizio picture is brighter with perfect colors and I'm in awe!!!  The only TV out there right now that produces a better picture but costs thousands more is the Samsung 75in. UN75F7100 approx $4100.00 dual core  & there top gun 75in. approx $5500.00 UN75F8000 quad core.  I'm retired so I watch lots of TV,  I'm also a big time Netflix and Amazon Instant Video freak. I was using a Samsung BDPS-790 BluRay WIFI ready DVD to stream my Netflix and Amazon into the LaserVue. What I can positively say with confidence is Vizio WIFI Streamer is a faster Streamer than the Samsung BDPS-790. I can also tell you is that Samsung's \" Smart Hub apps \"  both in the TV's and DVD's far exceed Vizio's 80in. TV and all other TV's on the market. Sadly the Vizio Amazon App is so basic, that you can only pull  one movie on the open and there is no favorites to keep store your movies. Plus the app only opens on the left side of the TV covering about 1/4 of the screen. It's not a full app like Netflix!  The Vizio Amazon  app  has locked up three times freezing where none of the buttons on the remote worked. The App completely failed requiring shutting off the TV and then turning it on again. That solved the problem. I called Vizio and they put the blame on Yahoo saying it was their software. Then the Netflix App froze and the screen locked up and nothing worked, not even the remote. I had to unplug the TV and replug it in again. When the TV booted up again and I tried Netflix it worked just fine and has not locked again for  the last few days. Update 10/20/2013 Netflix locked again read last paragraph below.  The got a great deal on this TV, I bought it online from Costco @ $3299.00 plus $99 in extended warranty for a total of 5 years and  $218.00 in state tax, when I hit buy in Costco's website it only charged me $18.00 in tax  for a total of $3417.00 delivered white glove. Then the very next day Costco cancelled my order by email,  and when I bought the TV a second the full $218.00 in tax was added totaling $3617.00. So I called Costco customer service and complained that Costco cancelled and raised my order by $200.00 in tax and asked then to honor the original order  then  they put me on hold for three minutes and came back and said they would  honor the original total order of 3417.00.  Now I left with this decision, because both Vizio's apps have failed and the Amazon app is basically worthless do I pay thousands more for the smaller Samsung 75 inch with better Apps and a better picture, or hope Vizio will fix this problem in the future? HELP ME DECIDE  Update 10/21/2013, today Vizio customer service reviewed my Amazon Instant Video & Netflix app's complaints and determined the TV was at fault and is sending me a new one. Therefore Vizio's Customer service is 100%  awesome and it only took two calls and less than ten minutes each time. For you first time buyers this TV high quality and there customer is the best. If you watch local channels and your not paying for service, like Direct TV, or Dish Network, and any cable provider you might be unhappy? There is no menu for the local channels. You will only get what is playing at the moment. To get past that I put the local TV guide on my smart phone and it dose what the TV dose not. It take getting used to.

The tv itself is great and has very nice picture quality and vivid colors. I have 2 major issues with this tv. Firstly, the remote is the worst I have ever experienced.  Like another customer reviewed, you have to point it exactly at the left corner of the tv where the sensor is.  If you point it at the center of the tv, after about 4-5 pushes on the button, the sensor MIGHT pick it up.  So i talked to customer service, she made me do some troubleshooting but still i have problems.  She then said she was going to mail me out a new remote.She also said if i still have problems, there might be a problem with the sensor on the tv, but not likely.  I asked her about a firmware update for the remote that i read about on another review, she said she was not aware of it, but if there is and my tv is connected to the internet, it will automatically update.  Well that didn't really help me.  Now for the second problem.  I love netflix and use it extensively.  I already own a vizio tv and with that one, you can search by genre, the way it is on the netflix website, which makes watching movies fun because you can browse hundreds of movies under a genre you feel like watching.  With this tv, you don't have that option.  You can, of course, search, but you need to know the exact title of what you want to watch.  They give you some 40 titles under some genres preloaded, like documentaries, horror or tv shows, but not the WHOLE list you get when you are able to search by genre, then browse the titles, and choose what you want to watch.  So I am pretty bummed about this $4000 tv.  I called netflix about this problem, they said every manufacturer has different settings of how to use their app.  Vizio said that they just provide the app, the way it runs is how netflix has provided it to them.  So who to blame, I don't know.  Please vizio and netflix, don't blame each other and please find  a solution, actually you already have the solution (as can be seen on my older vizio)  you just need to apply that software to this tv as well.  Please, please do.  Vizio, if you fix the remote problem and netflix problem, i will give you 6 stars, well since i can only give 5 stars, i'll give you that but in my review i'll say 6, promise.

As most people here, I have spent about 4 weeks solid; reviewing tv's, and stalking them as well. I have been to BB, HHREGG, as well as a few other specialty stores, and spent 2 to 4 hours in each store. (i'm retired so i can afford to do so).I have asked the sales people to insert proprietary 3d disks. The only thing that has not been possible is to attach my Xfinity/Comcast cable box to these tv's to compare the difference in picture quality.The first thing that needs to be said is that none of these stores selling said tv's have calibrated them. So some tv's that are highly rated on the internet, look terrible in the store.One example is  the Panasonic 65\" ZT Series Plasma HDTV, which was placed directly in bright lights in the hhregg store. The poor tv looked lousy and dark...Sniff.Another thing that you should know about the reviewer (me) is that I have been actively creating 3d objects and graphics for years. Resolution and color representation are so important to me.Couple this with the fact that I have light to moderate Aspergers. I can focus on microscopic details and differences for hours. Idiotic perfection of sorts. It's a blessing and a curse.The contenders we have selected for purchase (within our budget) as of today are :Sony 65\" XBR Series LED Ultra HDTVSamsung 75\" Series 7 LED HDTV - UN75F7100Sony KDL-70R550A 70-Inch 120Hz 1080pVIZIO M801d-A3 80-Inch 1080pPanasonic 65\" ZT Series Plasma HDTV.As of this writing, we have eliminated the Sony KDL-70R550A. Although it is by far the most affordable ($2100), the colors and picture quality are simply inferior to the others above.We are also probably going to eliminate the Panasonic plasma for whatever reason, the 3d was not amazing, and it's only a 65\" screen.If you mention the name VIZIO to me, I will start getting cold sweats. Although the Vizio M series affords plenty of great reviews, I still have a psychological barrier towards stereotypical cheaper brands. Quite frankly, I also have a barriers towards Kia and Hyundai, although they are great cars.I have had plenty of time to observe the vizio M801d-A3 and the Vizio M701d-A3 in action. Despite my mistrust in the brand, the picture both in 2d and 3d is excellent. Many reviewers  have said that the screen is too reflective and that there are problems operating the remote control on these models though. The screen on the Samsung 75\" Series 7 LED HDTV - UN75F7100, is also just as reflective. The color representation and picture quality of the Samsung is superior to the Vizio though.Anyone who is considering the purchase of a Sharp Aquos should definitely compare/study Vizio M models as well. Personally, I would buy the Vizio over the Sharps, I prefer the Vizios image over the Sharps, and the Sharp 80\" is very expensive too compared to Vizio. If anyone here is considering a Samsung 7100 or 8000 LED, do not even bother checking out the Vizios or the Sharp models.I hesitated a long time Over the Samsung models, and when my research was over, I invited my wife to review the results.The 3 models we studied were the Samsung 4k ultra @ 65\" and both the UN75F7100 and UNF8000 both at 75\".I saw very little picture quality difference between the UN75F7100 and UNF8000, however the 8000 series is much more expensive. For this reason we eliminated it.My wife and I have Apple Tv at home, so we are less interested in Apps and gaming. We like watching movies both in 2d and 3d.Next we compared the 4K ultra Tv's, the sony Xbr and the Samsung 4k. Both have a 65\" screen.For some odd reason we did not find the Samsung 4k impressive. We played a few Sony Demos on it as well as watched a few 3d movies on it, and It was marginally better than the Samsung UN75F7100. Also the 4k is more expensive by $2000.The 3d movies we watched were nearly just as good on the UN75F7100. We also found that the UN75F7100 had better COLOR REPRESENTATION...wait let me explain !!!The sony XBR 4K.If money were no object, I would buy the 85\" model of the Sony XBR 4 K ULTRA, right now.The sony XBR is by far the best picture quality and especially COLOR representation we have seen. By far!!!If you do not believe me, get a few 2d~3d movies you guys like, and go and force the sales people to play them on the Sony.Sony is reluctant to allow third party content to play on their demo Tv's because they want to show you their demo stuff (that looks exceptional BTW. But if you are going to spend 5k on a TV it's your right to be anally retentive.The picture quality, the perfection of color, and the passive 3d blew us away. This tv does an amazing job at up scaling content to a higher a definition of clarity and color.For me, the difference between the Sony and most of the other Tv's was like creating a picture in Photoshop at 72 pixels per inch and then creating the same picture at 300ppi, then comparing the two. Forget the fact that there is little to no real 4k content yet. This tv has by far the best picture.The huge dilemma we now have is. Which of these two tv's are we going to buy? The samsung UN75F7100 or the Sony 4K. The samsung is much larger +10\", but the Sony is better quality in picture and color.We found that the samsung UN75F7100 was not far behind in color, but there was still a visible difference. The sony image is much crisper/clearer. A higher definition, no doubt.The samsung screen is much like the vizio, extremely reflective to any object that may be in front of it.We preferred the sony's screen.Another dilemma we have is that we view tv from 12 feet away, so logically the 75\" samsung would be a better choice. Price wise they are more or less the same given a few hundred dollars.We did find the Samsungs stand quite unpractical. Due to the relatively long TV one needs two small tables at either end of the tv. We cannot wall mount it.The speakers are no doubt better on the sony which has speakers on either side of the screen. Anyhow, all these tv's warrant an added sound bar, so who cares about the original factory sound?Sony is coming out with the same tv in a few weeks without the speakers, So i may wait until I finally decide which of these two to purchase.Hope this review helps you guys choose a tv.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not As Good As Competitive Products", "Author": "Just Another Reader", "ReviewID": "R1KKY7USPYPRKW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these and ending up returning it.  I had two basic problems with it.  First the remote control shipped with the device did not work.  Customer service at Vizio was pleasant but unhelpful as they could not ship a replacement for up to 8 to 9 business days.  These new TVs don't have manual controls on them (except for one power button on the back).  You need the remote to work to do anything.  Making me wait 8 to 9 business days for a replacement seems unnecessary and very poor customer service.We bought a universal remote control and got the TV working, but it still had issues.  It would freeze and not power up or down or respond to the remote or the manual power button every couple of hours.  The only recovery for this problem was to unplug it and re-plug it. I suspect this was a defect with the TV.While the TV was working we were impressed with the picture, but the User Interface was clunky and difficult to use.  To go from HDMI2 input to HDMI1 input on the TV you had to hit the input button 5 times for instance.  There was no command to just go to HDMI1.  Trying to program the universal remote to automatically switch between the DVD player and the Cable box on the two inputs turned out to be very frustrating and in the end we just gave up.  This is only one example.  Everything on the User Interface was difficult to use and clunky. Anyone who has used a Samsung or a Sharp TV would be horrified by the interface Vizio provides.  They just don't get it.  It lacks polish.In the end we returned the TV and got a Sharp TV of the same size.  Once you adjust the picture settings on the Sharp away from the factory settings it looked as good or better than the Vizio.  I'd highly recommend the Sharp.Considering the money we paid for this TV I expected it to be awesome.  It had two hardware flaws, less than stellar customer support and a very clunky user interface.
