It has a gorgeous picture, does a great job of upconverting standard definition inputs and my Playstation 3 looks AMAZING on it. Also, the 3D Ready aspect delivers the most amazing and clear 3D. It's like seeing a 3D film in the theaters - although take note that it does require a PC with some hefty processing power as well as some expensive 3D shutterglasses and an IR transmitter for the glasses. The effect is brilliant though once you get it working. Also, ordering something like this from Amazon.com was quite easy and the delivery was fairly prompt and convenient.  If it were just these things, I would be giving the TV a perfect 5 score and encouraging anyone looking into getting a big HDTV to give this TV a shot because it really delivers a lot of bang for the buck.However, it lost a star for me because ultimately I had to return it which thankfully was very easy through Amazon.com's 30 Day return policy. Why did I have to return such a wonderful TV? Because I'm one of the unlucky people found in 20% of the population who can see the so-called rainbow effect on DLP TV's. If you are unfamiliar with this effect, look it up on wikipedia under the DLP article. At first, I somehow didn't notice this effect. This is probably because in my first few days of having the TV, I happened to only watch a few animated programs. But then, I decided to watch Bram Stoker's Dracula on Blu-ray and started noticing rainbows and color trails from almost the beginning. Another film I watched that suffered heavily from this effect was Ocean's Eleven.If you're looking for a great TV for a good price, I definitely recommend checking this TV out. But before buying, definitely try finding it at a store where you can check it out for rainbows. If you have a copy of Ocean's Eleven, you should probably see the rainbows pretty easily in the opening scene during the prison interview if you are one of the unlucky folks who see rainbows. Also, an almost guaranteed rainbow effect - even for those who don't normally see them -  can be seen if you pop in the THX Optimizer Aspect Ratio test pattern found on several DVDs including any of the Star Wars titles.If you are like me and find that you see the rainbow effect and yet really want a TV that uses the DLP technology, one possibility is Samsung's LED DLP TVs which are also found here on Amazon.com. The downside is that they are a little pricier than the Mitsubishis, but the plus side is that the LED technology is supposed to minimize and almost eliminate the rainbow effect.UPDATE: I'm afraid that if like me you are sensitive to the rainbow effect, then you should probably simply steer clear of any DLP system. I tried out the above mentioned Samsung DLP TVs as well and although the effect was eliminated in some cases, I could still frequently see it. Oddly enough, when I could see it on the Samsung it seemed even worse then the times when I saw it on the Mitsubishi despite the Samsung's supposed advantage in this area.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Could be great, but...", "Author": "Fellow Consumer", "ReviewID": "RK3G8A3ME6BE0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's a nice TV set, indeed -- the picture is crisp, the colors are natural, and the built-in speakers are well above average.  It would make a great product if it wasn't for an apparently flawed lamp/cooler/sensor combination.While we had our TV on for 4-5 hrs a day on average, six months after we got the set, the lamp went bad, and we had to replace it (that time under warranty) -- Mitsubishi service dept. handled it pretty well.  Less than 12 months later the second lamp went bad, so we had to pay for a replacement this time around.  And since about 2 weeks ago the TV started shutting itself down a few seconds after being turned on while reporting the lack of airflow (message on the screen and amber status light), so my guess is it's a sensor that's acting out.Poor lamp life is probably due to overheating, and that's in our big family room where typical temperature is about 74F and plenty of air flow.I cannot tell, however, if this is just our unit or there is a common problem with these sets.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "AMAZING!!!", "Author": "Jason A.

Out of the box the setting had to be tweaked a bit due to the blinding brightness that they have it tuned on from the factory, but after a few changes the picture was superb. Directv looks very good but this thing really shines with a 1080P source. Xbox 360 looks unbelievable, with the new texas instruments dark chip 4 im seeing details and colors in games I never have before. As for Blu Ray through a PS3, the picture quality is as good or better than anything this side of a Pioneer Kuro. For the price of this tv anyone who spends twice as much on a plasma or LCD that still wont be as big as this is a fool!! Yes I know you cant hang it on a wall but who cares, most home theater enthusiasts have too many A/V wires from all their equipment to make wall mounting an easy option anyway.

Let me tell you, this TV is awesome. I found it on sale and had my doubts about the size and features: I really wanted a 73 inch. I have it connected now and it is simply stunning. The color and clarity rival any unit I have seem, even the more expensive offerings. I am quite pleased that I followed my hunch. I even saved some money. When I am watching my TV, I do not even notice it is not 73 inces. It was easy to set up, connect and one can navigate between functions, DVD or cable etc., quickly and simply. I immediately connected my unit to a surround sound system so I can not attest to the quality of the unit's speakers.

You can agonize over the black and white levels and all that, but at the end of the day the Nascar Race, the football game, and my upconverted DVD's look spectatular in my less than ideal room.

Bass", "ReviewID": "R1GSI8GHX031DI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been waiting to replace my older pioneer CRT big screen, when I initially started shopping for a new TV.  I researched all of the options with LCD, Plasma, DLP, and front projector's.  My heart was set on a nice DLP front projector, but my lighting conditions in the living room would not have been ideal.  LCD blacks just weren't dark enough.  In regard to Plasma, I liked the pictures on all of the upper level Panasonics, Samsungs, and Pioneer, especially the Kuro, but their prices for anything over 60\" were too steep.  So I decided on DLP rear projection.First and foremost, lets get a couple of things out of the way.  This TV is not a flat panel, and yes I will have to change the bulb.  Mitsubishi sells replacement bulbs for $99, and I am very comfortable with replacing it myself.  While the LCD's and Plasma are very sleek looking and sexy, most people do not mount them on the wall anyway.  I had already decided I would be replacing my A/V component TV stand and any TV would simply be sitting on top of that stand.  So I swallowed my pride and took the plunge for rear projection DLP.While I initially was set on the the Samsung LED based DLP, I was waiting to see if Samsung would be producing an LED based DLP utilizing the Dark Chip 4 DLP chip from Texas Instruments.  Well as of last week at CES, it appears that Samsung will not be producing any new models of DLP this year.  On the other hand, Mitsubishi WD-65736 does currently incorporate the Dark Chip 4 chip.  After reading and comparing the Dark chip 3 to the Dark Chip 4, I bought the WD-65736.  I notice very little problems with the viewing angle while watching this and it did appear to be much brighter with better viewing angles than the Samsung LED based TVI am extremely satisfied with my purchase.  If you are in the market for DLP, You may want to buy soon.  There are rumours that BestBuy is to quit stocking these television by the end of 3rd quarter this year.  Once big box resellers stop selling these, it could mean the death to DLP.  Not because of inferior product, but because of a lack in sales.  Right now these sets are extremely affordable compared to LCD/Plasma.This Television is excellent and I am enjoying it tremendously.  I would highly recommend this set to any one looking to buy and uderstands how much more television you are getting as compared to LCD/Plasma despite the replacement of the bulbs and lack of it being a flat panel,  Which by the way, LCD's also require buld changes too!The only con I have thus far is that It is a lot bigger in my living room than what I though it would look like, but that makes Blu-ray movies that much more enjoyable.When I took my kids to the movies this winter to see Bolt, it cost $40.  With a TV like this properly setup, with a good HD source, I think the movie theaters have lost my business for good as the picture quality is as good as, if not better, than a theater.", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "My Mitsubishi WD-65735 65inch 1080P DLP HDTV", "Author": "Ann Wilder", "ReviewID": "R2FSIAZ3DG54X5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just love the DLP HDTV. I just got some basic cable for now but have high def dvd's and it is excellent. I have just moved and my home is full of boxes so I have to sit within 3 feet of the TV and it comes in great even this close. One thing of great importance to mention about the purchase is about delivery. The TV was delivered by an outside company who hired independent contractors to deliver the TV. The problem was they delivered the TV too early, not between 12 and 4 like they were suppose to, and I wasn't there. I called to get redelivery and they told me it was going to be another $95 (apx) to redeliver. I was outraged. I called \"Electronics Expo\" (the company that sold me the TV through Amazon)and had to insist on speaking to the manager for the Internet Sales Dept. because the customer service reps were adamant about charging me the fee. Once the manager was on the phone I played him a voice mail message that the sub-contractor left on my cell phone for me that the stated specifically that they were coming early. He then called the company and worked out a deal to redeliver to me and instead of charging me they would split the fee. I was very much appreciative but still I got a lot of flack about it. I received no apologies for the inconvenience just an attitude and statement to try to make me feel guilty to objecting to paying the fee. The sales reps should be instructed to point out the importance of this so the customer can make sure they are there and to keep track of exactly when the delivery company is there so as to not have to pay these outrageous fees it they are indeed early or for that matter, late. This left a bad taste in my mouth about the company and I am not sure if I will purchase from them again.", "Date": "February 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV for a Great Price!", "Author": "H.

Since then we seem to have a bulb explode about every 99 days(9 days past warranty) I have purchased every single bulb from Mitsubishi parts department direct. I am within the 90 day warranty time frame for this bulb at least, so I am expecting a free one.  all in all, we paid almost 1800.00 for this set, and since have paid around 600.00 in replacement bulbs.  I think when we can get some money saved up we will be buying a new 65 inch tv that doesn't require replacement bulbs.  So, if you're in the mood to deal with your tv exploding during a superbowl, or nascar race, or the best movie you've ever seen, then buy a mitsubishi dlp tv.
