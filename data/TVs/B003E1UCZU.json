{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My 5th Sharp LCD TV. Didn't Think I'd Buy Another...", "Author": "JOHN", "ReviewID": "R7P98GD5R9X8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already own 4 Sharp LCD TV's. This TV is to replace my bedroom 37\" Sharp LCD that is about 6 years old (still works great, but will be putting it in my kids' playroom).So, after looking around at all the different brands I decided once again to buy a Sharp, the LC-40LE810UN. Reading about all the nice features of this unit, including the introduction of the new color (yellow) technology is what did it for me.After 1 week of using my new TV I am happy to report I made a great choice picking this unit. I explain the main points why:*  LED technology provides cleaner, brighter lighting. This is apparent as soon as you turn on the TV. As this unit is edge lit, not sure I see a difference between it, or a back lit LED unit. Need more time to evaluate this I guess.* Adding yellow as a fourth color is definitely noticeable, and I like it. As most people know plasma TV's give you better color than LCD TV's. My Panasonic plasma TV is proof of this. However, I believe the LC-40LE810UN is a step up in LCD technology that brings it closer to plasma-like colors.* Overall picture quality is excellent.* The speakers are great, clear and loud. To me this is a major improvement for Sharp as their speakers are always horrible (like on the other Sharp units I have).* The picture and sound adjustment options are plentiful and easy to use. This has always been the case with every Sharp TV I've owned. This one is slightly better/more user friendly.* The unit is very well built and elegant looking, especially the glass base.In closing, I am definitely recommending the LC-40LE810UN to all. You'll really like it!", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best HDTV for Gaming", "Author": "jomojomo", "ReviewID": "R1ONHFX3YBKR20", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this one for the following reasons:1) Only LG and Sharp make all of their panels in house.  Sony, Samsung, etc all farm some of their production out to subcontractors.  And you cant tell by the model number, as in some instances, the same model will have two different panels; and the purchaser wont know until they get it home and their tv looks 10 times worse than the display model in the store.  It's called the panel lottery, and I did not want any part of that.  I also found out that Sony makes none of their panels anymore; 40% of Sony TVs are made by Samsung, 50% a Chinese company called AUO (iirc), and 10% by Sharp.  The Sharp the panels are only in Sony's top of line tvs, btw.2) We did not want 3D.  We both think 3D tv looks terrible, and is a waste of money.  Especially given the fact that Sharp's Aquos 3d tvs are $3,000 and up.3) LCD is required as this was going to be used gaming, and I don't want to have to worry about burn in with a plasma.  We have a plasma for movies and we love it, but I prefere LCD for gaming.4)The panel is cutting edge.  The panel is made in a state of the art facility in Japan.  It is a UV2A, 4 primary color panel, and imo, has the best picture of any tv currently made.  We spend more than a few nights trolling retailers, and the Aquos was always the best looking TV.5) Price.  We bought ours for $1199 with a 4 year extended warranty, unbelievable value.A couple of notes that you should keep in mind though.  It doesn't come wifi ready.  You can hook up an Ethernet cable out of the box, but if you want wifi you'll need a $75 bridge.  And if you have a wii, you'll need to get an adapter cable.  Although the panel is made in Japan, the final assembly does happen in other countries.  Ours was assembled in Mexico.  And finally, color accuracy is a problem with this model, but for video games it doesn't matter a whole lot.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than Samsung un32c6500", "Author": "sagrc18", "ReviewID": "R2G8BPKJH8RA9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent picture quality.  The Quattron really does create better colors.  I got a 32 inch samsung un32c6500 from HHGregg before I returned it for this Sharp.  They let me have the samsung for $975 plus tax, and when I explained how TERRIBLE the backlight bleeding was on the samsung, the guy let me trade it for this 40 inch Sharp led tv straight up, which was awesome.  There is ZERO backlight bleeding on this Sharp (at least on the one I got).  The picture is fantastic and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great LED tv.  Even though it is and edge-lit led, it has no backlight bleeding...so rare.  I'm lucky!", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "This TV Rocks. Seriously.", "Author": "Tommy", "ReviewID": "R2TOBAN58Y7T61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been toying with the idea of buying my first HD TV for a while. I have been going into places like Sears, Best Buy, ABC Warehouse, and Paul's TV for the last couple of weeks. I also have been checking out the prices and reading reviews on sites like Amazon. I finally thought I settled on either a Samsung UN40C6300 or a Sharp LC40LE830U. Both were $899 at the Paul's TV I looked. For the second time, I went into Sears  to check out the sales. I wanted LED (for the longer lasting bulbs and power savings value), a great picture, a reasonable price, and possibly a full array set if I could find one in my price range.I had no intent on buying today. I had two friends with me. Both friends and myself thought the picture quality looked significantly better on the Sharp TVs. Further, as a design major, I appreciated the overall aesthetic look of the Sharp as well. The glass panel and stand are very sharp (no pun intended). The Samsung wasn't bad looking, it just wasn't as nice as the Sharp. The TV really pops in my living room.There was no 40 inch Sharp on display other then a clearance model that was being sold for $799. I thought about buying it, and the sales guy came back with a flyer a few minutes after asking him questions about the floor model. He pointed out that a brand new model was going for $699 until the next day. After using my iPhone to check prices online, I jumped on it as I couldn't find it cheaper anywhere (which surprised me as Amazon and Paul's TV had the better prices before when I was checking ( Sears will beat an advertised price though)).First, the TV was super light. Although the box was bulky, I carried it in the house myself easily. The Samsung 27 inch CRT it was replacing weighed a ton. Attaching the TV to the stand was a matter of screwing in nine screws. Again, I needed no help (although one or two of the screws fought me a bit). What I appreciated was Sharp used regular Philip head screws so I could use my own tools to get this done. The job took about five minutes.Second, after the Sears guy told me I needed a HDMI cable to hook the TV up to the X-Box, I bought one. Turns out, the traditional X-Box cable would have worked saving me thirty dollars. I 'd like to think the sales guy was just trying to be helpful, but I am skeptical as he tried to sell me cleaner and an additional warranty all at the same time. I played a few games of Splinter Cell and Kinect Sports. It is like playing the two games for the first time. The graphics are amazingly crisp. I almost didn't recognize Splinter Cell. It was so awesome.  For built in TV speakers, the sound is very good. They certainly beat the speakers in the Samsung CRT it was replacing. If I want better, I will invest in sound system.Third, I also like that the TV swivels very easily (45 degrees each direction). I am unsure if the Samsung's swivel or not. I tried them at the store and if they did it wasn't without effort. I was afraid to force the issue. The swiveling is nice because I have a small living room where to play Kinect I 'd sometimes have to move furniture to get decent playing area. With the Sharp, I can just swivel the TV, which opens up more play space.Fourth, I ditched cable so I didn't' hook the TV up to that. I watch Netflix, Hulu Plus, and DVDs. Netflix and Hulu Plus never looked better. I also streamed music, movies, and photos from my Mac to the TV through the X-Box. The TV is supposed to do this natively, but I haven't tried it. Turns out to use the Internet features, you need either an extra wi-fi adapter or an ethernet hook up. I had neither. This wasn't really a big deal for me, as most of these features were duplicated through the X-Box, which was working via wifi. My photos taken from my Canon S90 looked real.Fifth, I was trying to avoid edge lighting and go with full array for the backlighting. I read the Sharp TVs use full array. Maybe some do, but this one apparently does not. I read on the Internet otherwise, but there it was on the box (which I discovered at home). Nonetheless, I haven't experienced the problem some of the Samsung's experience with the edge lighting (uneven color). Perhaps, Sharp uses a different implementation of edge lighting for the backlighting then Samsung. I don't know, it just looks great.Finally, I read Samsung outsources most of its panels. Supposedly, you can read some codes to figure out if the TV you are buying has a Samsung panel. I didn't want to bother. Sharp makes its own so I didn't have to worry about a TV looking different at the store then at home. Again, it didn't seem to be a contest in terms of picture quality even at the store. This TV is amazing.Ok, I lied. two last things. The remote is pretty confusing. I mostly, use the X-Box controller, so that isn't much of an issue for me. There is a zillion buttons though. My friend bought a Vizio online. He was so excited until he found the dead pixel dead center. This TV didn't have that problem. No dead or stuck pixels.Update: I have had the TV for close to three weeks now. I am still extremely happy with it. I find the menu system very easy to use, and it works great with my X-Box, which I use as a digital hub to connect with my Mac and to use services like Netflix and Hulu. The one question I was primarily concerned with is that this TV, like most LED TVs, is an edge lighting model as opposed to a full array set. Full array sets are supposed to be superior because they spread the lights used for the back lighting across the whole panel, whereas edge lighting models place the lightening only along the edges. This light is then reflected across the panel using a mirrored back. Some people with other sets, and at least one commenter for this set, have suggested you can see the lights along the edge of the edge lightening sets when watching content that contains a lot of black. Not to devalue these experiences, but I have not noticed this effect and I have been consciously looking for it.Update 11/27/2011: I still love the TV and it is working great. I, however, have had it hooked up to the Internet. This is nice for installing updates, and using the few so called Smart Apps the TV comes with. The included Netflix app is a real disappointment, but not a big deal for me. You can only view your saved Netflix que on the TV. The Netflix graphical presentation is a bit last decade as well. Again, it is not a big deal for me because I gain excess to certain web apps through my X-Box and Apple TV. If, however, you are using this TV thinking the Web App experience will be great, you might be disappointed. Also unlike TVs of the past and some LCD TVs friends have, this TVs screen seems to repel dust. The top of the set gathers dust, but the screen always seems to be clean.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Brilliant color", "Author": "W.

Its very sleek and very thin.  I dont use the TV's speakers so I cant comment on the sound.  The only negative about this TV is the internet connection.  It only connects to the internet via a Ethernet connection.  I had to spend another $75 on a Ethernet bridge to get it to connect to my wifi.  If your router is next to your TV this isn't a issue but if its in another room you either have to run a long cable or buy a bridge. Why Sharp doesn't offer a wireless connection on these TV's is beyond me.  For the price, it should.

I don't know if it's the yellow pixels or what, but everything you throw up on it looks almost three dimensional. Really!Typical Sharp quality that no doubt stems from the fact that they manufacture their own components. (Or so I've been led to believe anyway.) When I first looked at it in a Big Box, I noticed right away that the images seemed brighter and sharper than anything else in the store. Old BW movies look amazing on it.This also gets used as a computer monitor. Consequently, the fact that it has 4 HDMI ports along with everything else is a huge plus. Satellite dish plus blu-ray player plus computer still leaves room for expansion. Has other features I'm still learning about.Do yourself a favor and buy this flatscreen.

I am an Electronics Sales trainer and am certified for LCD/LED and Plasma technologies by the C.E.A.A.(Consumer Electronics Association of America.)

The sound quality isn't great but what do you expect out of a TV that is no more than 2\" thick and if you have trouble hearing the TV it's probably a problem with the TV so have it looked it Sharp will cover it under warranty and they are one of the better companies concerning Customer Support plus the Aquos TV line has a dedicated support staff that works round the clock!!

But I have NOT regretted the purchase one minute.  I did have a few difficulties in the initial setup and hope the following will be helpful to those who have a cable modem and a router on a different floor.  I had to get the cable guy out to bring me a box that would read HD.  After he left, the picture looked really good, but then I decided I had to tie the TV into my WiFi network to use those features.  I called Sharp support, and did not have to wait long at all until someone came on the line.  She said a dongle (sp?) wouldn't work and that my BEST option was to buy a pair of ethernet devices that would plug into the wall (one on each floor) and use the wiring of my house (I was skeptical because we have an old house).  These came with an ethernet cable so that you just plug one into your router and the other into the ethernet port on the back of the Aquos.  Best Buy had them for about $200!  After I plugged them in, they worked fine, but my picture looked degraded to me.  So back on the phone with my cable provider (no help--couldn't understand my problem) and then again with Sharp.Ah.  There was an input button on my remote and once I scrolled down to the correct HDMI port (I thought it was in number two, but it was really in number four!) and clicked, the picture was transformed into something absolutely fantastic!  Netflix streams beautifully and shows that communicate in 480i are all upgraded and look beautiful.As you can tell, I'm ecstatic because I never thought anything could look as good as my Samsung plasma.", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, however...", "Author": "LeeVitalone", "ReviewID": "R5E0SMZKJRAB7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I agree with most of the reviews on here, this TV does have a great picture, especially with x box 360 or ps3. However,what a lot of people probably don't notice is that when the screen is totally black, or during a very dark scene in a movie, you can actually see the light from the edge LED's, which can become very annoying. I especially noticed it while playing mario 2 on the NES (played on my PC with VGA, 1920x1080 resolution), with level 1's solid light blue background, the edge LED's are very noticable, especially while the screen is moving, they look like black marks along the edge of the TV when the screen is blue, and while the screen is black they look more white. This is a problem that just about all edge-lit LED tv's have. Also, images don't have quite as much depth as a full array LED set, or even a traditional CCFL LCD tv. Despite these draw backs, it is still a great TV with a great picture, most of the time if your just playing an x box game or watching tv you won't notice the edge LED. To the guy that is certified for LCD/LED and Plasma technologies by the C.E.A.A.(Consumer Electronics Association of America)... that must not mean very much if you didn't know that edge LED offers less picture depth than a traditional LCD tv and more picture anamolies. Also the 120hz refresh rate is nice, but most of the time it is better when turned off. While playing x box 360 it offers no noticable improvment with the 120hz, infact it actually makes the screen flicker when the camera is turned, since no 360 games run at more than 60 frames per second anyway. Also with movies, they are recorded at 24 frames per second (24hz) so turning the 120hz on during a movie actually makes motion look worse. Although, it is nice to have the option to use 120hz if you want or need it, but it really is not needed at all. This TV can also display at 70 or 75 hz through a pc connnection. Despite all it's problems, for the price, I am satisfied with this unit.

The picture is amazing. unlike complaints about other companies, the Netflix connection was simple and has no problems at all. I got rid of my Roku box and now can control my connections through the TV handset.  The HDMI cable (noticed complaints about the amazon cable so bought the Media Bridge ultra series cable) the colors and control are perfect with all areas.  The sound alone was very good.  I will consider a home theater sound in the future.There also is support through Aquos both online and via phone which was helpful and courteous.  I highly recommend this product.

It was incredibly easy to set up and adjust the picture to my liking, and very easy to use. I've attached everything that could be attached to it (except a gaming console as I'm not a gamer) and it works beautifully. The picture is so crisp and the color so true it's almost 3D. Because the picture is so outstanding, I've become an avid Blu-Ray DVD watcher. I like the internet access to the Blu-Ray extras. I use the Aquos Net when I don't feel like turning on my computer. I like the Screen Dreams that displays HD photo slide shows, nice if the TV is wall mounted and you don't want to see a big black screen all the time. You can also plug in a USB stick to watch your own personal slide shows or listen to your music.The Aquos Advantage is a great personalized service if you have questions or problems with your Aquos TV and want to speak to a real live person. In this sense, Sharp's customer service is excellent.The TV goes easy on my electric bill and generates virtually no heat when turned on. The sound is good, but I purchased a Sharp Sound Bar to enhance the performance.I am thoroughly satisfied with the Sharp Quattron and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to invest in a great HD TV.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Zz Norton", "ReviewID": "R2PZ13IYQXACMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV quality is great.

I honestly don't see any difference in a 4 color spectrum over 3 color, but again the picture is crystal clear with bright vibrant colors.
