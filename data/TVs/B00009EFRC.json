Wallace", "ReviewID": "R1CA3P4TM7KEJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously reviewed my HLN4365W set with the Samsumg DVD player using DVI output, and normal TV.  I now have HD digital cable and want update the review.  HDTV comes in two aspect ratios, normal and widescreen.  Some of your favorite network shows will be in HD but normal aspect ratio - hence the black bars on each side.  Increasingly, top network offerings are delivered in HD widescreen filling the entire HDTV screen.  The quality of these pictures is superb, surpassing that seen with the best DVD source.  I find myself selecting programs based as much on picture quality as content.  In short, this TV will not dissapoint whether the source is DVD or HDTV.", "Date": "March 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "highly dependent on source quality", "Author": "Supperconductor", "ReviewID": "R3IX3BR8G1PDQL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To get the best from this TV you MUST feed it a good quality signal. The best way to connect this set to any source is via the DVI connector. An HD signal from DirecTV or a DVD played on a HTPC (Home Theater PC) looks absolutely stunning. On some of the standard definition channels that have a lot of compression, you will see flaws in the picture because the TV is quite revealing (almost ruthlessly so). Also, the picture is spectacularly bright, so viewing in a well lit room is no problem.[...]", "Date": "March 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV!", "Author": "Michael T. Rognlien", "ReviewID": "RU54TCL8AG0W3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, OK, it's spendy.. but this is clearly not a must-have item for any household, it's a luxury!  As far as luxuries go, this is one of the best and most affordable considering what you get.I love the fact that this TV only weighs 60ish pounds.  I've had to move it a number of times as I've been hooking up peripheral devices, and the light weight of the TV is appreciated!Also love the fact that, unlike other widescreen projection TV's, the DLP technology assures there will never be tube or burn-in issues.  Since much of the TV we all watch is not broadcast in widescreen, viewing in 4:3 is required if you don't want to add 20 pounds to every actor/actress (well, that might not be all that bad these days..) or stretch scenery to where it looks unnatural.DVD's look AMAZING, especially if you have a DVD player with a DVI output.  Samsung makes and Amazon sells one and I can't recommend it enough.Long story short - this is an expensive TV but the light weight and the outstanding picture quality (esp from a distance of ~10 feet) make it worth the purchase.  You won't be disappointed!", "Date": "April 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Was Great the 1st year and a half", "Author": "D.

Anderson", "ReviewID": "R5BTWUTA90W4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this product and had some concern because of a couple of the ratings given.  After a couple of days rerunning wires from my DVD, VCR, Audio System and of course the most important thing of all my HD cable box, I was in a New World of TV enjoyment.  The key is that everything from TV is not HD compatible yet, but there are channels out there to get you through the night.  This product provides you with great bravado.  I'm not going to go through a lot of tech stuff to justify what I see, but if you want what you see and hear about in adds about really feeling like you are looking through a window, this is the way to go.  Hay dudes go for this one and stop wasting your time looking.PSYes I did research which included a number of testimonials.", "Date": "May 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "No Worries", "Author": "Jan at the Ranch", "ReviewID": "R3FZ4N01F79Q7B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I bought this set I did some research, well, a lot of research and everything pointed to the DLP. After checking around town, I found the Samsung DLP at a local independent retailer. While talking to the salesman, he was trying to get some idea of what I needed and it all boiled down to this set. Unlike others, I did get the extended warranty and have had only one call on it in 4 years. The picture is great from any angle and the color is super. In addition, I connected mine to a home theater system, albeit in the living room, so I have no idea what the speakers are like. After reading all the \"bad\" reviews I don't know if I got lucky or they got lemons. I'm happy and friends like it as well. My son didn't believe that the DLP was different so he walked up to the set, eyeball-to-eyeball, and decided it really was different from the others and is a believer. To me, the nice thing is that I don't have to think about buying a new TV in a couple of years. You replace the lamp, under warranty, and it's just like a new set!", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Expensive and supposedly bad customer service", "Author": "N. Das", "ReviewID": "R2HIQQV870UYT7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got the tv yesterday from Sears; actually a floor model and hence the price was less than usual. Definitely an improvement from the behemoth Toshiba that I had. I did do some research prior to purchasing and this is what I found.Overall everyone seems to like the pic quality. Sony is the closest competitor; if you manage to set the pic correctly there should not be any difference. Switching to satellite from cable supposedly improves pic quality. Since I bought it just yesterday, I cannot say a lot about my experience - the pic is truly great.However, some also complained about the bad Samsung customer service. Moreover, the bulb needs to be changed every 8000-10000 viewing hours and one can probably do it (according to the manual) without calling the service personnel. The bulb costs around $250. Some customers had a bad experience with the bulb within the first few months of its operation.Overall, I tend to have no regrets about the purchase and really looking forward to the experience. If something goes awry, I will let you folks know.", "Date": "April 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "Never buy Samsung DLP tvs", "Author": "Rose Saia", "ReviewID": "R24FN9W7PB98SN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a HLN 4365W and despite the good quality of the picture, it has been the most expensive TV I have ever owned.

Turnipseed", "ReviewID": "R30LYX69A4IIU3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a Samsung television about eighteen months ago. Two weeks ago the picture became all distorted. Since my television warranty was through Circuit City I had no choice but to call a television repair person out to look at it. As soon as he walked in the door he knew what the issue was. He told me that the part would cost almost as much as the television and that his recommendation was to throw away the television and purchase another one. After doing some research I discovered that there were quite a few Samsung televisions that were going out and that the parts were on backorder for about a month. Samsung was also not helpful. I trying to discuss this with SamsungTweets on Twitter, but he blocked me when I asked why nobody called me like he said they would. The only other answer I got from Samsung was that I needed to take it to a service center; this is after I told them that a television repair person had looked at it. From what I can tell from looking on television repair forums, Samsung televisions look to be pretty flakey.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poorly designed", "Author": "Worksux \"Worksux\"", "ReviewID": "R3ALL3I4IK5421", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you want a trouble free set stay away from Samsung.
