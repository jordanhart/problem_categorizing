Sony has a win...", "Author": "Mark Fitzgerald \"MLF\"", "ReviewID": "R2MYW7N0X7NUFM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hello all,I work for the Big Screen Store in Fairfax, Virginia. We just received this set. I have been in the industry for over 8 years now and have sold the best that Flat panel has to offer (Pioneer Elite, Sony XBR, etc). When I first un-boxed this set, I immediately adjusted the settings to accommodate the proper levels for our store HD feed. I was very impressed with the color, clarity, and black levels of the image. It was vivid, but still very natural, and skin tones were very good as well. As earlier posts have mentioned, YES the LCD is 64.5\" Diagonal, which makes it a 65\" TV. There are plenty of inputs available for all types of goodies. Setup is very easy as with all new Sony products, and with input sensing there is no need to cycle through unused inputs on the TV, thus saving time and effort when switching from CABLE/SAT to blu-ray. As with all TV's over 50 inches, DVD's look okay, and not because there is something wrong with the TV, it's just the limits of DVD video quality. You MUST HAVE a blu-ray player to fully take advantage of the set.I must admit, I was a little concerned when I heard Sony and Samsung had inked a deal with Sharp to produce the 65\" panels for them, but I am very impressed. THe Sharp model lacks a good video processor and thus cannot produce the image quality of the Sony or Samsung 65\" LCD. Overall I am very impressed with the set.As with all new Flat Panels, the sound sucks really bad on this TV. Even if you don't want/need surround sound, I strongly suggest a separate sound setup. Whether it's just stereo or surround. All TV's now have only 5-30 watt speakers, and most of them are built on the BACK SIDE of the TV set for aesthetic reasons, which is obviously not conducive to proper listening. I have sat in many training's for Sony, Samsung, etc. All the manufacturers have the same mindset, they don't care about sound, they assume everyone in today's age has at least a separate stereo system. Do you know that headphones run on 5 watts?!!! At 50% plus volume, it's like taking a nice pair of headphones off your head and listening to them at a distance. Do yourself, your ears, and the TV a system a favor and get a sound system!!!!Thanks !!", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best BIG screen I've ever seen", "Author": "S. Ferguson \"Cub fan\"", "ReviewID": "RXBDPARN6LKM5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this 65\" Sony LCD for about a month now, and it is incredible. I replaced a 63\" Samsung plasma that I had just had delivered. The Samsung had a really clear picture but, despite its size, the picture just didn't have the impact you expect from a screen that large. It just wasn't bright enough. The Sony really took care of that. The colors are natural but they really \"pop.\" The clarity and brightness tremendous. And let's face it, larger screens are a lot more fun to watch, as long as the picture quality is retained. Watching sports and movies on this set is mesmerizing. It reminds me of the first time I had an HD set and would watch anything, just because the picture was so phenomenal. Everything is a blast to watch on this TV. I can't imagine how it could be improved (although I have it hooked up to a surround system, so I can't comment on the TV speakers).", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV", "Author": "Betty A. Earley \"earle\"", "ReviewID": "R1YPOGJZT19VYF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were torn between the Samsung LN65B650 tv and the Sony KDL65W5100.  We finally decided to purchase the Sony, due to the fact we have a heavily lite room.  The Sony TV has a fantastic picture right out of the box, and we are totally satisfied with this purchase.  There is no glare during the day light hours making it exactly what we needed.  We would highly recommend this tv to anyone.  You will not be disappointed in your purchase.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outdated TV", "Author": "Sportsman", "ReviewID": "R7MJCCPMGVR91", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This TV is outdated and replaced by newer and less expensive Sony models that have more current and robust technology, including 3D capability.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best deal for 65\" HD TV", "Author": "Harry H.

I don't own this TV but I am looking for a 65 inch unit to replacemy 65 inch xbr rear profection. I did a little investigation and called Sony and they referred me to there outlet stores. I called three different stores, two in Las Angeles and one in Gilroy Ca. and only one had the TV in stock but the salesman was kind enough to measure the TV's screen size. He called me back about two hours latter and told me it measured 64.5 inches diagonally as Sony advertised it. He also said the gentleman probably measured the TV on the horizontal axis. I am not writing this to dispute the other reviewers measurements but I also know that Sony has been building great TV's for a long time and they know they could never sell a TV that is four inches smaller than there specs says. I can't and will not pretend to speak for other people but if I purchased a TV that was that far off in screen size I would return it immediately.  I also look forward to comparing this TV with Samsung's new 65 inch 65B650 when they become available.
