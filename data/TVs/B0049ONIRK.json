{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great LED  TV", "Author": "Chris E", "ReviewID": "R1NEAYT5TJZ5ZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a 42 inch JVC TV (LT-42E910). A bit pricey, but wow, what a difference in LED! Get a JVC LED for sure (If you want an LED). Crisp picture, vibrant colors, and great sound. No, you don't have to buy a separate theater surround sound with the 42 inch JVC. I never liked the idea of having to buy a whole new theater sound system for a new television. The 32 inch JVC LED LT-32E710 is around $500 to $600, but don't know if the sound matches the 42 inch JVC LED. Simple set-up and picture controls that make sense, Not like the overkill of picture settings on some LCD/LED sets. The 2011 JVC LEDs seem to have it down better, and JVC is a brand that is under the radar. The only negative I have seen so far is some slight ghosting on some channels of the JVC, but nothing too distracting. Watched a DVD, and it was better than being in a theater! Time will tell, and hopefully this JVC will last a long time.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "LCD HD TV's go somewhere else", "Author": "Scott D. Schabot \"Scott\"", "ReviewID": "R1088HVHETAAU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My parents bought me a JVC 47\" LCD HD TV two years ago when I bought my first house out of college.  Two years later the picture goes out every 10 minutes forcing me to turn off the TV and turn it back on, and then it stopped coming on at all.  I figured this was probably a unique problem but after 5 seconds of research online I found out that it's common among all JVC LCD TV's.  JVC should be ashamed of selling something like this knowing they only last 2 years.  Broke my heart to tell my parents the last time they were visiting I had to throw away the TV they spent $1,400 on because it was a piece of junk.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Ultra-compact\nUltra-fast USB 3.0 performance\nUSB 2.0 compatible\nResistant aluminum\nReady for Windows 7 and Mac OS 10.6", "Name": "42\" Led LCD High Definition", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31mP5ycMepL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0049ONIRK"}}
