(the remote sucks)The mute button of all things is at the top of the control, across from the power button.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a 3D TV !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Bhavesh Patel", "ReviewID": "R3PR6A43EMLLFP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is a falls advertisement friends.
