This TV was exactly what I was looking for. I received it yesterday and it worked halfway through its first movie and hasn't worked right since. It's like it freezes or something. The picture stops and then slowly goes grey. When this happens I can't even access the menu or adjust the volume. I have to just shut it off. If I let it \"rest\" for a few hours it will work for a few minutes and then go gray again.I have to assume that my TV is a lemon, and if it worked I would give this item a much higher rating. I was very happy with the picture (while it was working), and the set itself looks slick.", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Awesome...", "Author": "T.K. \"Mr. B\"", "ReviewID": "RW5VW1CMPQL1A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great LCD.  I have a Sharp Aquos 32\" and Mitsubishi projection.  All sets are being run on HD and TIVO boxes, the picture on this set is great for its size and price point.  Totally acceptable great picture.

It worked, but two days later the screen went black as  night. I thought it was me, but no it was the tube. I even took it to work and the same thing showed.

I ordered this to use as a monitor for my laptop and also as a tv.  However, the ONLY computer resolution it can use is 800x600 which on a 19\" screen is way too grainy and made my eyes hurt.  I discussed with Maganavox tech and admitted it was a problem.  I returned and am now shopping for a computer monitor with tv tuner.", "Date": "February 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best deal out there", "Author": "Hank Miller", "ReviewID": "R3GK85F4C7S7SC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this TV for use at trade shows.  Excellent portability, nice bright picture, and unlike a lot of other TV's in this size, decent sound.

It was a great TV for the price - while it worked!I enjoyed the space saver with all its possible connections/functions.  I could connect my stereo, DVD player and laptop to it with no problem.  Even with all the possibilities of it being used it was hardly used (my wife and I have a very busy schedule outside of home). Then one Friday evening preparing for movie night with my wife (and we have no kids to blame), the thing would not cut on.  I tried looking for a site that may offer some technical assistance but to no avail. (By the way, if you know anything about televisions (LCD) or where I can get help please post.)  I can't lie, though, I am disappointed but I really miss it.  I am still indecisive as to whether to fix it or just get a new one (HELP!)If you decide to buy be aware that you will enjoy only as long as it lasts.", "Date": "February 19, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$549.99", "Features": "Remanufactured to like-new condition; includes 90-day warranty\n20-inch LCD TV; measures 23.2 x 17.7 x 7.8 inches (WxHxD) with included stand\n2D digital comb filter and 3D motion-adaptive deinterlacing enhance picture sharpness for a crisp, natural look\nInputs: 1 composite, 1 S-Video, 1 component, 1 VGA\nTwo stereo speakers, 3 watts apiece (6 watts total)", "Name": "Remanufactured Magnavox 20MF605T/17 20\" Flat Panel LCD TV with NTSC Tuner", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EPCP6KCHL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000B67CAO"}}
