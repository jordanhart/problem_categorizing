{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Product will not work on universal remotes!!!", "Author": "A. Gray", "ReviewID": "RE7U0MQLKUV8V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have just spent 2 hours on a beautiful Saturday afternoon chasing down a code so that I could operate my new Curtis TV (LED4250A)on my brand new DirecTV remote (RC66RBX model).  DirecTV had MANY possible codes but NONE worked.  I researched this problem on the internet and sure enough there is site after site of people asking about the codes for their Curtis TV and not just for DirecTV but also Comcast and many others.  I called Curtis directly (1-800-968-9853)and was given 3 possible codes. While I had them on the phone, I tried the codes and none of them worked.  Their response was for me to just use the crappy remote that came with the TV because no code was compatible with this TV.  What? When I explained this wasn't acceptable to me, they then claimed they were working on a code.  The sites I had seen on the internet dated back to 2010.  This has obviously been a problem for quite some time.  However, the rep at Curtis TV told me I was the first one to call about this issue.  Really? When I continued to press them, he stated again that they were working on a code and I could call back.  Seriously?  His other recommendation was to return the TV.  That's a little inconvenient for me.  They could not tell me if there was any kind of universal remote that would work on the TV.  They were absolutely no help whatsoever.  My only hope is to possibly find a learning remote that I would put head to head with the Curtis one and transfer the information but I'm not getting my hopes up.  Since I can't use my DirecTV remote on the TV, it is affecting the use of my sound bar and locking that in as the main sound source. Frustrating.Although I am happy with the picture on the TV, the sound is horrible - to the point that I've purchased a sound bar.  The remote is about as basic as they come and very cheaply made.  The setup and on screen menus look like something out of the 1970's.Stay away from this TV and all Curtis International products.  This company has some major problems.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it!", "Author": "gailh \"gailh\"", "ReviewID": "R2UPS2XK9BDSD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wasn't sure what to think after the previous reviewer gave it a 1 but after reading it, their only problem seemed to be the universal remote they were trying to use with it. I haven't tried anything other than the remote that came with it and have had no issues. The picture is beautiful. Set up was a cinch (I have a stand where it hangs from). If there's a bug a boo, it's that there's no audio out for my old theater system. Overall, I like the system!", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.99", "Features": "42-Inch LED TV, 1080p - 16:09 Aspect Ratio\nConnections: HDMI, VGA, YPbPr, AV Audio/Video, PC Audio, Headphone\nViewing Angle: 176(H)/176(V)\nMulti Language On-Screen Display, Sleep Timer Function, Bass, Treble, Balance Controls\nWall-Mount Ready", "Name": "Curtis 42-Inch Ultra Slim 1080P LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Man59AI9L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005YVTKYM"}}
