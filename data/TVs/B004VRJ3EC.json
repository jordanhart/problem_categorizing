{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Crisp Standard-Definition Picture/Great For Bedroom", "Author": "Nagshead \"'Net addict\"", "ReviewID": "R3FV0R49YB36Y7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a period of adjustment, I've come to be quite pleased with the quality of this TV.  Standard-Definition looks crisp on this TV - and, after having seen the way other brands of TV render standard-definition signals (when I was trying to see if a different TV would be a better fit) - I have to believe that this Samsung TV is among the very best among the recent \"entry-level\" TVs  at displaying standard-definition TV.  It's good to know that Samsung hasn't completely neglected the consumer who still watches standard-definition TV - for I imagine that there are many other people out there who need a new TV, but cannot commit to the greater expense of high-definition TV.1ST SET DEFECTIVE, 2ND SET FINE: The original Samsung UN26D4003 that arrived at my door had a couple of problems.  There were a few areas on the screen that looked \"washed out\" (particularly when displaying black and/or dark images) - as though the \"pixels\" in these areas were not functioning up-to-par.  And the overall standard-definition picture left a little to be desired - at least when you stood closely to the screen.  Somehow, I thought that it was possible that I had received a defective set - instead of it being a problem with all Samsung UN26D4003s.  So I contacted Amazon about the problem - and Amazon was wonderful about shipping (completely free-of-cost) another set to me right away.  Sure enough, the problems I had with the first set have been absent with the replacement set.  Once things \"settled down\", I realized that this set really delivers on the quality.SMALL FOOTPRINT: One of the things I like so much about this TV is that - for a TV with a 26\" screen-size - it has a small footprint.  You can check out the published dimensions for yourself.  The borders of the TV are very thin, and there is no visible \"speaker bar\" underneath the bottom border.  These facts contribute to the TV's simple, elegant look: other 26\" TVs look bulky in comparison.  The TV's smaller footprint saves me precious inches in a modestly-sized, cramped bedroom.NO PROBLEMS WITH STANDARD-DEFINITION (4:3):  There was another reviewer - Stan - who had the complaint that the Samsung wasn't displaying the full standard-definition picture of his DirecTV.  That review made me hesitate a bit in buying this TV - but after rationalizing that Stan's review didn't mean that I would have the same problem, I went ahead and pulled the trigger on the purchase.  Sure enough, I was relieved when I had no such problems.  The standard-definition picture of my Comcast Cable has fit the screen perfectly.  The default display mode is NOT \"Zoom\" (the setting that gave Stan some problems) - but \"16:9\".  The \"16:9\" setting does not cut off any part of the picture - and it fills the screen when displaying scenes that were intended to fill the screen.  In order to ensure that the picture fills the screen perfectly - be sure that the correct setting is selected.  With this Samsung, this setting is NOT called \"Zoom\" - but \"16:9\".BLACK BARS NOT SAMSUNG TV'S FAULT:  Sometimes, I will watch shows in which the picture does NOT fill the entire screen - black bars will appear across the top and bottom.  Whenever this happens (and it happens somewhat frequently) - I know that this is NOT a flaw of the Samsung TV, or even my cable company.  It's due to how the show's producer, or the TV station on which the show appears - decides to display its product.  It has become a little bit of a trend for companies to broadcast their shows in a widescreen format - with the black bars on the top and bottom.  For example, I believe Fox TV is now showing NFL games like this - and ESPN seems to now broadcast most of its shows like this, as well.  There is no setting on any TV that will \"fix\" this.  I don't really mind when shows are displayed like this - I'm pretty used to it, and am barely conscious of it.  If anyone has a problem with this, there is really nothing you can do but take it up with the TV station or the show's producer.CHECK WITH YOUR CABLE/SATELLITE PROVIDER (IF NEEDED):  Apparently, it is possible to make some picture adjustments through your cable's on-screen menu or DirecTV's menu - so if you encounter any problems that you think could/should be fixable, an additional option is to try to fix the problem via your cable/satellite box or company.LOTS OF OPTIONS FOR PICTURE ADJUSTMENTS: This Samsung offers a vast array of picture adjustments - considerably more than most \"entry level\" TVs.  This review has gotten long - so you can check the user manual on the Samsung website for further detail.  But if you're anything like me and need to have lower brightness levels and \"warmer\" colors - this is a great TV to have.  It's also great if you like your TV very bright - and/or with vivid colors.  There are several settings that allow you to \"fine tune\" the picture to your liking - including \"Advanced Settings\".BIG SOUND, LOTS OF OPTIONS FOR SOUND ADJUSTMENTS:  The sound is more than adequate for my bedroom.  Heck, as far as I'm concerned, the sound would probably be good even in a large living room.  The volume goes all the way to \"100\" - and rarely do I need to have it above \"15\".  Much of the time, I have it below \"15\".  And there are an array of sound-settings which you can select to make those \"finer\" adjustments:  for ex., there is a setting that supposedly enhances people's voices above the \"background noise\", and a setting that is \"ideal\" for music.  You can activate SRS TruSurround HD on this TV - which gives more of a \"movie theater\" quality to the sound.ONLY ONE A/V-COMPONENT INPUT:  One thing about this TV that may be a drawback is that it only has one A/V input.  Furthermore, this A/V input is actually a combined A/V-component input - so you cannot hook up a device that uses A/V (a.k.a. composite) connections and a device that uses component connections at the same time.  For those of you who don't need these inputs - or only need to hook up one A/V or component device - this isn't really a problem.  But for those of you who need to hook up 2 or more \"older\" devices that connect via A/V or component - you may be frustrated.  It may be possible to get around this limitation by getting a \"component to HDMI\" adapter or a \"composite to HDMI\" converter - but I'm not  knowledgeable or experienced about this, so I don't know how well this works.DISPLAYS MY VCR/DVD IMAGES WELL:  I have a VCR/DVD recorder hooked up to this Samsung TV via the A/V input - and I've been pleased with the quality of the images.CUTE FEATURE:  one small, endearing feature of this TV is that it makes a gentle \"chime\" sound when you power it on or off.SMALL INACCURACY IN AMAZON'S DESCRIPTION:  I can assure you that the screen diagonal is a full 26\", not the 25.5\" that Amazon lists in the specifications above.Overall, this TV lives up to Samsung's good name.  4 stars instead of 5 - simply because I would have liked to have had an extra A/V-composite input.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Shame", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "R2RH4UZETW01GG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great picture and is perfect as a bedroom set, however the lack of ports and the fact that there is no Audio out just keeps this from being a 5 Star product.

Probably does not matter to most people.  If you are hooking up surround sound, does not matter.  Personally, I have been more than happy with the sound quality of a couple of good quality PC speakers hooked up to the headphone jack of my previous TVs.  This allows volume to be controlled with the existing remote control and results in easier hook-up and less cable clutter.  You cannot do that with this TV and you probably will not be satisfied with the built-in speakers on this TV. (Update:  Built-in speaker performance improved significantly after changing sound mode to \"Movie\" and turning \"Tru-surround HD\" and \"Auto Volume\" on.  Still not as good as external speakers though).Checked four other televisions for sale on Amazon (2 Samsungs, a Panasonics and an LG) just to make sure this feature hadn't been phased out industry-wide and 3 of the 4 had audio output and one had an actual headphone jack.So, if you want to hook your TV up to speakers without losing your ability to control the volume through the same remote, keep shopping.I just assumed all TVs had some kind of audio output.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Horrible!", "Author": "R.

However, and I have myself to blame, I assumed that it came with the same input and output options as all my other Samsung monitor purchases. As with most Samsung monitors I have experience with, the speakers are terrible so I have external audio speakers set up. The old 23\" Samsung LCD TV this replaced had an analog audio loop that output whichever source you had picked, HDMI, broadcast, etc. My 32\" Samsung has an analog and an optical audio out. Even my cheap Samsung computer monitor has an audio out. My surprise was to find out that this monitor has no provisions to hook up your own sound system. I managed to set my self up with an RCA analog switcher, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014KOAD8/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details, to get the audio from my BluRay and the cable box to the external speakers but it means that for now I can't use the TV remote to switch the audio or control the BluRay sound. It would be nice if someone made a smaller sound bar that switched HDMI.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "For the price, not impressed.", "Author": "justsomeguy", "ReviewID": "R1HEMWQLTFD8T5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would say picture quality is fine: I have tried the various inputs and HD programming, etc, looks excellent. It's a thin and super-light unit which works well.It has hardly any inputs: 2 HDMI and one Composite.  One Coax input as well.  No additional Composite inputs or optical or the old RGB hookups.  I need several older devices to plug into this but just can't do it.  For the space available, it was the largest unit we could get at Best Buy, and for the price, I'm just not sold on it.  It looks good, but really needs way more inputs.The \"switches\" on the front of the unit (on/off, etc) are invisible, and aren't buttons at all but touch-switches.  I thought this was cool, but in dim light, you can't see where you need to press.  I have older people using this TV and that annoys them.  6 remotes sometimes they just want to press ON on the thing they want to turn ON!!!", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture, tin can speakers", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "RA9YPT3ZSH6M0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I read all of the reviews and was hoping the reviewers were just being critical about the speakers because it was a 26\" tv and the speakers were normal speakers for a tv this size. I have to say i should have listened as the speakers have an annoying buzzing noise when watching movies. I am debating whether or not to return this as it is for the guest bedroom and I already mounted it. As a Samsung enthusiast owning 5 other samsung TV's, i have to say I am a little disappointed in this TV. I mean really samsung, what were you thinking by not including audio out, what did you save, $3.00 a unit in production?  I could at least have picked up a cheap soundbar to compensate for this short coming. on the other hand the picture is nice and crisp as expected from a Samsung TV and it is very light and thin.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung", "Author": "Mark Hartman", "ReviewID": "R3HXIYD7Z62V6Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is really close to what it was advertised as.

The picture is very nice even out of the box.  The field of view seems to be good at wider angles.(That was my main reason for returning the Sharp)  The sound as others have noted is OK.  That seems to be very common, especially on TV's of this size and price.  My biggest concern is on the attachment of the base to the screen.  There are only 2 short screws to tighten and you don't want to over tighten and strip out the plastic. At best there is a good bit of wobble, and this attachment seems barely adequate.

Plugged it in and no issues.  Love the automatic feature where it removes scrambled channels as it does the scan for channels from your cable company.  It only leaves the ones you can actually see, which my other TVs haven't done before.Remote is great.  Simple to use.It actually pulls in some pretty good detail on the channels as to what is playing, etc. (even without a cable box hooked up), just with the features built into the TV.It doesn't have 1080P, but who are you kidding!  You don't need it on a 26\" TV.  Don't listen to anyone that tells you otherwise.  You won't notice the difference.Picture quality is rather good.  Crisp and clear.  Color has a slight yellow cast, but I haven't tried to mess with the settings (and there are many).As the other reviews state, there is no audio out.  If you are expecting big sound from this thing forget it.  Its a small, inexpensive TV that has small inexpensive speakers.  But it only costs $229!  We have it in our bedroom and the sound is fine.  If you want to watch movies, you probably would want it on a 42\" unit or bigger anyway.I highly recommend it as a casual TV or one for a smaller room.Match your expectations to the price and size......", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "For my purposes, this is a perfect television", "Author": "hair", "ReviewID": "R3NB61XQKY4454", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with this television - for my purposes, it is perfect, and arrived in perfect condition as I purchased it from the \"used or previously opened section\".

I would have liked to return it but the carton was disposed of.  Amazon apparently has no customer service so I am stuck with it.I am using this TV with DirecTV.  Most of their programs are coming thru with 480iand I do not get a full screen picture.  The manual states to use zoom, but when I do that, part of the picture is missing and half of the closed caption. Also any box scores when live sports are on will not show. the \"use full screen\" button will not work with the 480.  I have called Samsung twice and they just say, use zoom!If you do not use zoom you get a full picture with a black horizontal bar across the top and bottom of the screen.
