{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Picture, Wide HDTV, PIP, PC monitor under 1K!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2N1O80I0T9YDS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our review is based on the fact our unit has not broken down in the month we've had it (unlike the other 1 review currently published here).  We love this set. The picture quality is superb, even with SDTV via Time Warner digital cable.  HDTV output is fabulous.  Nice bright images with good contrast without the usual \"noise\" which was our primary criteria for choosing this unit.  Sound quality is good for a bedroom but there are no audio outs for those wanting to add additional speakers (we didn't).  It is VESA compliant and is under $1K usually.  It also has PIP with an additional tuner (VCR) and can be used as a computer monitor.  What more can you ask for a thousand bucks.", "Date": "April 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "Nice while it lasted!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2LH33HVYTKGCV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After only 3 weeks of infrequent use, this TV failed.  All of a sudden there was no picture upon powering up.  Prior to this I found that the clock setting feature didn't work.  Obtaining service has been a nightmare.  Zenith sent me to the closest service center, 30 miles away.  A few hours after dropping off the TV, the service center called to inform me that Zenith told them it could only be serviced by the factory!  Zenith refused to replace it with a new one.  I've been given no idea of an estimated return date.  Other than that, the picture was very nice, programming was easy and the set's attractive.  Plugging in cables was difficult.  There's only a headphone audio out, not left & right channels.  Switching between input devices was slow as was changing channels.  Setting favorite channels was very slow. Update: received TV-picture OK but clock still not working.  Service Dept. said clock chip a known defect, but no date for fix.  Why didn't they send me a new set with a good clock?  After several calls to Service & Customer Service, Zenith agreed to refund the full purchase price upon return (again) of the set.  Could've been much worse, I guess.  Contacting Zenith was easy & the staff were pleasant and helpful, but I still wasted much time on this.  Can anybody suggest a TV to replace this one?", "Date": "March 27, 2004"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "17-inch widescreen LCD HDTV monitor; 18.6 x 15.8 x 6.7 inches (W x H x D)\n176-degree viewing angle for distortion-free viewing from anywhere in the room\nPicture-in-picture; contrast ratio: 400:1; 16.7 million colors; 1280 x 768 native resolution\nHigh-resolution component, RGB-H/V, S-Video, RF, A/V inputs; headphone output; DC 15V input\nTwo 5-watt speakers with Dolby Virtual Sound, volume leveler, onscreen equalizer", "Name": "Zenith L17W36 17-Inch LCD Flat-Panel HDTV (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515WZ76TDKL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0000A2UAW"}}
