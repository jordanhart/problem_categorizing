{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An amazing, beautiful TV!", "Author": "Remy Chevalier \"Remy C.\"", "ReviewID": "RC597UX27LRYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One reviewer wrote he tweaked and he tweaked some more but could never get that perfect picture. I will admit, it took me a little while at first, from the factory settings which are really designed to blast the brightest screen possible on a showroom floor, to find that awesome sweet spot. But we did, and wow. The secret is you have to reduce the backlighting to almost a half, and then play with the sharpness, brightness and contrast. Reduce the color and tint levels, and eventually you get a picture that is gorgeous, deep blacks, great skin tones, rich in color and details. Maybe it's not plasma, but it's pretty darn close, and when you think of the energy you save, and all the added benefits of LED vs liquid crystal, in terms of longevity, I'd say it's well worth it.The controls are in fact so elaborate on this set, there's even an advanced section where you can tweak the colors one at a time, red, green, blue and yellow. But there's really no need to touch that.The edge lit spots around the screen, all back lit LED screens will display these, it just comes with the technology, no longer appear once you've reduced the backlighting level. You will see them again as you shift channels, as it takes longer for your cable box to switch between HDTV channels, but as soon as the colors, and the black kicks back in, the light spots are gone. So you won't ever seen them while you are actually watching something.The bass and treble controls threw me for a loop. At first I thought they didn't work because I couldn't really tell the difference. Then I realized it's because we don't really like to listen to the TV very loud. But when I cranked up the volume I heard that the bass and treble was working fine, just set up in such a way as to really have maximum effect when you're blasting the speakers. They can get pretty loud without any distortion, you can pick between either surround sound or stereo. There's control settings so you can adjust sound projection into the room. We wanted a set we didn't have to install external speakers for, this set provides great built-in sound without the hassle.Model LT-46265 is supposed to have 18 speakers, vs 16 speakers for LT-46164. I looked and kept counting, I could only see 16, so I wondered if maybe the dealer had given me the wrong model. But no, it said LT-46265 on the back, that's also where the two little additional speakers a located, in the back of the set, to bounce sound off the back wall. So if you're not wall mounting the set, leave a little breathing room in the back to allow the sound from the back speakers to project.LT-46265 comes with built-in Stream TV which you can just hook up to your ethernet modem. But it's an additional pay service. Instead I ran a HDMI cable from the back of my PC directly into one of the extra HDMI port on the set. There's a PC setting. You will instantly display what is on your computer screen on your TV screen, in beautiful resolution. I was amazed to discover that if you play HD YouTube videos on the TV that way, in the expanded screen mode, the resolution is just as good as HD channels! That means you can rent a video at Amazon, right here, in the Instant Video section, and watch the movie on your TV screen. No wonder Blockbuster just went bust.The set is made in Mexico, says on the back, not Japan, which is an interesting detail to know. It might be a bit pricey, but if you love graceful and functional design in the same package, great sound, picture, and tons of features to interact with online services, this set is the bomb. It's light to carry, easy to set up. I just wish Mitsubishi wasn't so involved with nuclear power. But every large electronics company has skeletons in their closet.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't bother", "Author": "PT", "ReviewID": "R24FXJITCUB13D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Beautiful screen. If I could just get the intermittent vertical bars from flashing on my screen, would be great. WiFi is a joke. No matter what I do, I cannot get it to connect with my 3 wireless routers on any setting. Product support is a joke. At this price point, Mitsubishi blew it. Who wants to spend hours on the phone with a call center support idiot that can't do anything other than repeat what is in the very poor users manual? For example. nowhere does it even say what type of security the WiFi router uses (nor is it settable).Oh, and the Mitsu remote can't be programmed to my scientific atlanta cable box (these are so obscure! Only tens of millions of them out there) nor my Sony DVD player.So... don't bother. Maybe MItsu cars are better.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "My humble opinion...", "Author": "Robert Diggle", "ReviewID": "R9CGPVUU9J74L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a loyal Mitsubishi Diamond Series DLP owner and have owned Mitsubishi products back to the day of the CRT sets, I needed a lightweight medium size display for a small family room, The Mitsubishi Diamond Series Unisen LT-46265 Edge Lit LED LCD was to be the solution... Amazon was a great choice as the return policy is excellent, thank goodness...At first the Mits has a nice look, until I noticed the Mits logo peeling off the bezel, which the bezel, in reflected light, is warped and distorted, so far this is not a deal breaker.After careful installation it was time to go to work, as with all Mitsubishi, I knew there would need to be plenty of time to tweak the picture, so we tweaked, and we tweaked, and we tweaked some more, we tweaked for hours and never got that perfect picture. The picture quality and color saturation for lighter scenes was acceptable with the unit having a hard time with skin tones. Moving on to the black levels (or should I say blue levels)we noticed at all settings we tried, in dark scenes there are 12 blue spots evenly spaced around the screen (edge lit led) we never got the desired black levels, this and the un-natural sound quality are why this unit gets a 1 star rating. We replaced the Mitsubishi LCD with a Panasonic TC-P50VT25 3D Plasma, the Panasonic plasma straight out of the box was totally amazing, (picture quality and sound quality) we will be calibrating this unit soon and posting a review when completed. My advice - PLASMA ! (but do your homework) not all plasmas are created equal...", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture and sound", "Author": "K.

The internet is very nice and seems to be just as user friendly I found in comparison to most smart tvs. I didnt care about 3d tvs my focus was on clarity and picture quality primarily which is why i opted for the 240hz led...The picture quality is also superb...I've owned Mitsubishi Televisions for the last 10 yrs... I recently heard through the grapevine that Mitsubishi televisions are actually built by Toshiba now...but still decided to purchase this anyway and glad that I did. I love it...if youre looking for an amazing picture (one of the best, in comparison to lg,sony,vizio,and samsung)...you wont be disappointed and especially for the price. I've had my eye on this Led tv for awhile now and got it at an unbeatable price. If you can score this Under $1300 you got a lot of television for your money. This 46 inch fits perfect in my room and i really couldnt ask for a better television. As far as other not so great reviews that i read...my answer is anything built on earth not in heaven you never know what youre going to get. Most customer service centers for any product you buy are runned by minimum wage uneducated employees reading off a computer or a script...thats even if the customer service is in america lol...regardless my ultimate advice when purchasing anything would be to get an extended warranty....if youre a worry wart.  Products unfortunately don't last forever so make a wise choice...and I feel I did....  p.s. When this tv blows up...hopefully not in a few years lol you'll get another review from me....but until then I hope this helps....cheers!", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dead in less than two years!", "Author": "photobug \"kfjgtn\"", "ReviewID": "R3NNLS9J21LOCF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Great tv if you don't mind buying a new one in less that two years.

It had a bad digital board right out of the box and had to be returned.  An exchange for an identical set was initiated and we have had that TV since early May. After putting the set through a full setup procedure, the image produced is quite stunning.  Sound is good, but not as good as from our 35\" Mitsubishi CRT set that we replaced after some 15 years of problem-free service. An issue we had with the current set was over-scanning in which about 20% of the available image is beyond the frame of the screen. The issue turned out to be semantics: \"full\" vs. \"standard.\" This nomenclature confused even the company's customer service folks.  Use \"full\" if you want to see \"all\" of the picture.Some facts buyers should consider: 1) The angle of view for this set is only about 10 degrees to either side of the viewing axis.  If you and your wife will be watching TV from the same couch and in line with the center axis of the screen, great.  If you expect others to sit farther to the side, they will see a more washed out, cloudy, contrast-less, image.  2)The surround sound does work, and works pretty well.  Don't compare it to your 5.1 or 7.1 system in your home theater, however.  It's a gimmick; use it and enjoy it as a gimmick.  3) The probability of receiving a Mitsubishi set with problems right out of the box is high.  You'd be better off buying a Sony, Sharp, Samsung or Panasonic model with similar specifications. However, in doing so, you may not enjoy the better picture provided by Mitsubishi, properly set up.  Over the years, we have had a very good experience with Mitsubishi TVs and bought this one with that experience guiding our decision.  I'm not sure I'd do that again. But, if you have lot's of patience and can setup the set properly, you will be rewarded with a better than average viewing experience.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Mitsubishi Diamond series Laservue", "Author": "arizonafanatic", "ReviewID": "R2NNN1G7FCR5AO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Man is this thing bright.

It was on clearance from $2200.  We asked why the deep discount and the salesman said because it was a discontinued model.  This was the ONLY TV we found at the time that had a 240Hz processor for less than $1200.  The Picture is AMAZING.  Sound is good too.  The 240hz processor really bumps up the clarity of this TV.  Since we don't have cable I really like the internet apps.  A direct link to many Podcasts so you can watch on demand for FREE.  No problem streaming Netflix thru the Wii.  Watch College Football on ESPN3 thru the computer via a PC-HDMI connection.  Some of the content available thru the web apps: G4 Network, Showtime, TNT, NBC Nightly News, Today Show, Discovery Channel, X Play (Extreme sports network, NOT X rated), all stream on demand when you are ready to watch.  works wirelessly or with ethernet connection.  One of the REALLY cool features I like is that it has a bluetooth connection, so I can turn on my iPod and listen to music streaming thru the TV. It is Awesome.Only negative is that it takes a LONG time for the TV to come on.  On indicator light comes on right away but it takes a full 90 seconds for the screen to warm up and reach it's full brilliance.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Cool HDTV for having it all in one package", "Author": "Gregory A. Colvingarcia \"GCG\"", "ReviewID": "R1EGMH89ML3TID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have read all the reviews on this product plus some... Know what your buying before you purchase it.  I have tracked this product for over a year and finally purchased one since they don't make them anymore and there are only a few left out there to purchase.The initial set-up even with everything I read was difficult but that was more me than the product.Top Hints;1)If over 42 years old have your reading glasses available the print is small in the instructions and on the remote.2) Reduce the backlighting to 50% and adjust up to your liking (\"Video\" button on the remote or from the main \"Menu\").  This reduces the edge lighting of the LED screen and produces superior dark tones (blacks).3) In order to connect to your wireless (WIFI) you must go to: Menu then Inputs and then the last ICON on the Right (use arrow keys to move the cursor to the globe looking thing).  Then press ENTER. The system will search for WIFI signals - arrow down to yours and press ENTER.  If your system has a security passcode like mine then the TV will prompt you to enter the code.  In order to enter numbers you have to hit the number key until the number appears it will take 4 presses for every key but the \"1\" and the \"0\".  Press the \"1\" as many times as it takes to go through all the special characters until the number 1 is displayed then press Enter.  The \"0\" doesn't require any additional pressing.Note: Capital Letters are achieved by pressing the \"LAST\" button on the lower right side of the Number pad area of the remote.  You only have to press it onces and all your letters after this will be capitalize - if your password is like mine, all the letters are capitalized so push this first and then begin entering the code.Also don't be frustrated if the WIFI doesn't connect the first try - this happens a often but I found it works on the second try - who knows, it's all magic...The \"Blue Tooth\" feature is designed for Audio only so know this going in and it is the same for the USB ports - they are intended for photos and audio files not more video.The \"Video\" button will allow you to pick from predefined options that you will have to learn about using the main programing menu and over time you can build a few customized viewing options based on the type of programming your watching but for the basics it offers: Natural, Brilliant and Bright.  The default I believe is Bright which seems to be a middle of the road setting...Well that's what I have to offer - Peace and Grace,Oh and if some one has some suggestions about enhance the deep field imaging to make the HD viewing experience less like watching a Soap Opera - I'd appreciate it!GCG", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't buy it.
