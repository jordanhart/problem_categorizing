I finally came across this TV. Sense it was going in a bedroom it didn't have to be huge. I looked at this at walmart and decided that it had the best picture for the money. I decided to check out Amazon and wow what a savings! I saved about $50 bucks and got the same TV! It is awesome! It has great sound and a beautiful, clear picture.
