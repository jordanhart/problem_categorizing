If you are leery about it not being a name brand don't be.  This is a great TV!  For those that complain that the sound is terrible you have to go into the equalizer function and adjust it to your liking.  After messing with the equalizer the TV sounds great.  Super loud too! If you have problems connecting to Netflix there is a simple fix.  From the internet settings change it to manual and for DNS1 enter 8.8.8.8 and for DNS2 enter 8.8.4.4.  It worked like a charm and it will save you some frustration.  The picture quality is fantastic.  I have no complaints.  With four kids we use this TV a lot and it's perfect.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FA5547O"}}
