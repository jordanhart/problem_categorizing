Fell in love with it and almost bought it. The price was more than I could afford, but promised myself that I would get it as soon as the price was right and before Christmas 2010. Glad I waited as Amazon had it at an unbelievable price during the Thanksgiving \"Black Friday\" week. This is my first LED TV. Still have the old style TV, but that will probably go to a re-use store.I can't say enough about this beauty. I loved the screen/picture quality in the store and knowing they usually set the store models at their peak performance level, was ready for a slightly lesser quality. Guess what? No change. Straight out of the box it was great. Beware, though, that you need to run the channel setup before you see the best pictures ever. The channel setup picks up all of the digital channels and regular channels. I do not have a cable box. Just connected the cable to the TV. The \"any-net\" system recognized my Sony BD so getting on my netflix account is a cinch. Also there is no direct connect to the internet with this 5000 series. Unfortunately, Samsung's ads make you think that, so don't bother buying the Linkstick.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good TV - Samsung was not ready to support", "Author": "John Robert Hight \"johnny634\"", "ReviewID": "RSYTOVPHDL17C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this TV as soon as the 2010 models were available.The Amazon purchasing experience was what we have come to expect:  easy, with delivery as expected.We had problems out of the box that were not related to the TV itself, but rather related to our cable provider, Brighthouse Networks.  In attempting to resolve the issue, I first called Samsung on about March 11, 2010.  The Samsung folks were unable to identify the model based upon the information I gave them from the label on the back of the TV.  Finally, I was told that Samsung representatives had not yet been provided with any information on the new 2010 models.  They were unable to help me at all. I was told that someone would call me back before the end of the month (Remember, this was March 11, so Samsung was are promising to call be back within three weeks!). I find it strange indeed that Samsung would begin delivery of products they are not prepared to support.That said, the problem was eventually diagnosed by Brighthouse and was related to their system not to the TV itself.  The TV has a fantastic, almost unbelievable picture.  Other than the fact that the speakers are marginal, I have not discovered anything I do not like about the TV.  I'll have to hook it up to play through my receiver, but given the thickness of the TV and the limited space for speakers within the unit itself, it's hard to believe the sound is as good as it is.This is a great product.  Hopefully in future years Samsung with have the sense not to sell new products before they are ready to support them.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Super thin tv", "Author": "L.

Um... wow! not too long ago there was no way you could. I have a big plasma tv in the bedroom and wanted to change my old old tv in living room. I decided i wanted a smaller tv there so it is not all about a tv. Something i can watch from the kitchen while i cook. Prices where higher then i thought for tv's now a days and i wanted to get a good picture. I learned about all the specs and this one had it all except not the fastest motion rating.120 hz which is fine. I could not tell the difference in the store from 120 to 240 at all!, so i saved money there. Samsung is known to make the best lcd tvs and they just look so beautiful too. Perfect. It was easy to set up but takes two people to assemble. One thing i find is it takes a while to start when you press power. The picture is great and better then my plasma most of the times but i have noticed when you watch scenes where it is shot in low lighting... like a night scene or if it is a really old movie.... the blacks are way too black and you loose all detail. I played around with the settings and nothing helps. I was surprised as all you read about is make sure there is a lot of blacks in the tv you buy.. i think it is over kill and mids need to be in there. I chose the 40 inch as it was the best deal for your money. I could have chosen the 46 but the price sky rocketed for that. Oh and there was a deal on at the time where if you bought the tv you would get a free blue ray dvd and wifi adapter. Awesome as now i can stream netflix and such. Another thing i found was that at first when i saw how small my 40 inch was (i thought it was going to be bigger) i kinda panicked and cursed to myself i should have gotten the 46 inch. But when you turn the tv on, somehow the picture looks a lot bigger! So it was actually perfect. Anyways i think the Samsungs are the best tv's out there and you will not go wrong.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect TV", "Author": "Pavan", "ReviewID": "RDGFR0RQF2G7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this product during Thanksgiving, and I got it at best offer.  Initially I am not inclined towards LED TV, but finally I got Samsung 40\" LED UN40C5000, and it is simply perfectly awesome.  It has many features like, best picture/video quality, different number of modes, USB video/audio/picture playback etc.  But there are few things you need to remember before buying this TV.  VGA cable connector port is too thin at the rear end, so getting this VGA cable is little bit difficult.  Audio coming from TV is good, but when audio is playing from external source like USB then it seems like, audio output is very low.

The volumn level in the headphone jack does not seem to be ajustable and is a little loud for me.Now the off angle picture quality does fall off radically.As the reviews state, there is quite a bit of blue cast in the blacks.The screen backlight inconsistancy doesn't show up when you are watching content, only in certain black screens modes.If the content has a blank, black screen then the screen is quite black and evenly lit.Over all I am still happy with the product, mainly perhaps, ultimately I only paid $500 for it.  It arrived with a broken base and the company refunded me $125 of the original purchase price, refurbished.I think if you are considering this set, the biggest caution would be if you need good off angle picture quality, then get something else.

Flat screen TVs don't have much room for good speakers. Mine sounded all bad radio and tinny. Luckily, I had two Bose computer speakers not being used so we hooked those up to the TV. Better sound but not without its own problems. Can't be controlled by the TV remote for one thing. If you select TV speakers with external speakers connected you will get sound from both but increasing or decreasing volume with the remote doesn't affect the external speakers.

The TV is also extremely thin and light.The only complaint I would have about it is that there is no S-video input. I'm not going to dock the TV for it's sound because you don't buy a TV for the sound quality, you buy a TV for the picture. It kills me when people will criticize it simply because the TV speakers don't sound like surround sound, get real.I have it hooked up to my PC (HDMI to DVI cable) with the audio going from my PC to external speakers I have for watching movies from my PC. I still can't figure out how to get sound from my PC to play on the TV speakers because the TV separates sound/video source DVI/3.5mm stereo input from the HDMI input (from what I can tell so far). That's why it may be smarter to go with just a straight up DVI cable if you want to play the sound from your PC to the TV speakers.

It is sleek, the design is awesome, and picture quality s crystal clear.Design: The design is amazing on this TV. It is nice looking, and the red design on the outside panel is a nice touch, although you won't be paying much attention to it. It's nice to know that Samsung was focused on the overall package, not just the quality of the picture. Also, it is very slim and light weight, making it easy enough to set up.For TV/ Movies: Perfect. Picture is great, and the colors are stronger than LCD's, but not as rich and deep as one would expect with a plasma.For Gaming: This is where the TV kind of falls short. It's refresh rate only stands at 60hz, and compared with plasmas, it is weak. Especially when it comes to fast motion gameplay. If you're looking for a TV for gaming, I would recommend either finding an LED with a higher refresh rate, or skip straight to a plasma and save some money.Despite it not being that good for gaming, that is a mere step back.

I purchase a lot of my electronics through them because they discount things an insane amount for having chips, scrapes or markings on them. When I read that this TV was for sale for under $500 due to a back-side defect, I ordered it right away. After all, who looks at the BACK of a TV?Well, I received the TV and found that there was no defect at all... until I started assembling it. You see, the screen was absolutely perfect - still in the plastic, not a scratch or mark on it - and the bezel was in perfect condition. The problem was with the STAND: one of the tiny little plastic pieces on the stand had chipped off, which made the stand relatively unstable. Well, since the other \"stability chip\" (the plastic piece that inserts itself into the back of the TV, effectively created the bond between TV and stand) was still intact and the TV required screws to mount it anyway, I decided to take a bit of a risk (for now) and mount it.It worked. Now I'm viewing a gorgeous, 40\" LED TV with pristine picture and okay speakers (seriously, don't complain - this TV is so thin, about 1.5\" at most, you can't complain about not having awesome HD speakers). I'm still worried about the stand... by the way, I didn't even receive enough screws to fully mount the stand to the back of the TV either. I got 5 out of 10 screws. Ordering a new stand and the screws through Samsung costs around $40, but I'm going to try local stores for screws and I'm ordering the stand through a different vendor for cheaper.All in all, the television is exactly what I'd hoped it would be, and since I knew I was getting a small defect, I wasn't surprised when I found the stand was a little busted. Still, I couldn't be happier with the quality of the picture and excellent features of this television.
