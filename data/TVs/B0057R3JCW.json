This set was on sale for $249.99.Where can you get a 32\" led/lcd for that kind of money?", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "UPDATED SEE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BELOW Appeared to have been opened and resealed at the Factory BUT GOOD Product", "Author": "C.

Constant black square shaped artifacts appearing on the screen for some channels.That White greasy residue mentioned in the first post, well I discovered the greasy agent was apparently used to cover up the extensive damage from what was splashed on it.  Once after the unit is thoroughly cleaned and wipe down , eventually the back and bottom of the unit is COVERED in WHITE SPLOTCHY CIRCULAR spots!  GREAT, to send a used item, repackaged to appear new and ship it out as a new product.I like the Televison, priced right at 259.99 32inch with 1080p GREATDidn't like that I was advised it would not ship until December 19 to early January, 2 weeks later an email was sent that the item was available then within hours 5 or less my card was billed and the item shipped the same day.  Would have been great had I expected this.The unit itself had splash stains of some greasy white residue underneath it with a finger print on the bottom of the framefront as if it had been opened and used a little before it was shipped from the warehouse.Otherwise I'm so far quite satisfied with my purchase.  It has a GREAT Picture quality.

So far, I am thrilled with the results.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  The text is crisp and clear and easy to read with my old eyes!  (By the way, for use as a computer monitor, I would never get anything less than a 1080p, regardless of size. Buat make sure your video card handles 1920x1080 resolution.)I haven't hooked it up to cable or DVD player, so I have no opinion on that.  I also have no opinion on using the remote control functions since it was pretty much plug and play for me.  I also don't use the sound.Several years ago, I had a 42\" Westinghouse LCD-TV that I used as a TV.  I had no problems with it, so I didn't hesitate to get another Westinghouse at the $249 price.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "bob", "ReviewID": "RFZWUU7Q217TB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv for use with my gaming desktop, and it works flawlessly. To my dismay I realized I didnt have any hdmi cords when the tv came, so I would have to go buy one. grreeat. Took a look at the back and what do you know, it had a vga port! awesome. Shipping and customer service was great too. It will first estimate that the product wont arrive for a while, but a few days later it will most likely say that it is going to arrive sooner than orignally expected, at least thats what happened in my case. Anyways since I did not think it would ship in time, I called amazon and had them cancel the order. Apparently it was already in the shipping process, but they would tell the carrier that I was going to refuse the shipment. Well next day I look at the tracking, and what do you know its at a station only TWENTY minutes away from my town, but it says it is going to be shipped back to the seller!!! I thought I was screwed. During school I used the online chat feature with a amazon customer service representative, her name was Kelly. Not only was she extremely understanding in nice, she also didnt mind calling fedex herself and explaining the situation. She even let me know that she was on hold, and it would be a couple minutes. Anyways, long story short: She got everything straightened out, and the tv arrived on my door step the next day. The 1080p quality is amazing, there IS a difference between 1080p and 720p, so if you can, go for the 1080p. Im typing the review using the tv/monitor right now.(as for those of you who wonder why in the heck someone would need a monitor this big for a computer, i edit videos and game) In conclusion I was very impressed with the friendliness of amazon customer support, even after me changing my mind they were able to make me happy. awesome. Some of the best support I've ever had from a company.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Complaints", "Author": "Ishmael \"cleverlemming\"", "ReviewID": "R2JWWHSMBHKH7B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my mother so she could watch digital television using the antenna I installed on her roof. The fact that it has a built-in tuner was important. I read reviews that were critical of picture quality but broadcast HD looks great to me. This TV is also nice and loud, which was important to my mom as she likes to listen to her programs while she's in the kitchen. I only thing I didn't like about this television was having to contact Westinghouse to get a secret code, which has to be entered using the remote, to scan for broadcast channels. This is a clumsy and inconvenient way to harvest your location. I would buy this television again at the price I paid for it, but it's gone up over a hundred dollars in the last two months, and by seventy five dollars less than a month after I bought it. I've been seeing similar price increases in my wish list items. I'm not sure if this reflects the apparent rise in import prices because of the continuing dilution of US currency or some kind of holiday pricing strategy. Either way, it'd be time for some serious price comparison before I bought another of these.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than expected", "Author": "Bryand", "ReviewID": "R2QWISDMCY21JT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Most people say 720p is good enough at 32\", but I can really tell the difference between 1080p and 720p at this size. Especially when you have a ps3 hooked up through an hdmi cable. Games just look awesome on this tv. You must use hdmi cables to get the best quality. Any other connection type will just disappoint, even the component connections. The colors needed adjusting but the tv can easily be enjoyed straight out of the box. The color scheme on this TV are vibrant.  The sound is okay, but like with most TV's, it's better enjoyed with a surround sound system. The controller isn't special but gets the work done.Cons: Connecting the stand is the worse. I don't know if this is common to their TV's but to many parts and screws. A second pair of hands would help when putting the stand on. Sound quality isn't that great, but I did mention it before.Other Thoughts: You can see the limitations of 60hz, but it's adequate for most situations(ie. Movies, gaming, local TV).  The controller needs to be directly pointing at the IR receiver, unlike other tvs where all you need to do is point in the general direction of the TV in order to receive the signal from the controller.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice HDTV", "Author": "packmule", "ReviewID": "R2XLUIJNVRLED7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV back in early November, 2010 as a second TV. I use it in the back \"office\" room of my basement apartment. I was on a budget($300) and looking for a 32\" and ended up paying $259.99 plus tax for this unit from Wal Mart. I have never owned a Westinghouse brand TV and bought this unit more out of curiosity than anything else. The reviews I read before my purchase have been mostly positive.The TV is easy to set up, the picture quality is excellent. I use this unit for watching cable(A T & T U-Verse) and also watching HD \"on demand\" movies ordered as rentals through my cable provider.I actually use this TV more weekly than the 37\" Vizio in my living room.

Not sure that I would put it in my living room as my primary tv, but if you are looking for an excellent TV for the bedroom I highly recommend this.  My only complaint is that the position of the cable coxaial input is a bit hard to screw on. Make sure you pickup an HDMI cable to connect to your cable/satellite box.
