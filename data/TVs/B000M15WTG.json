{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Mintek 26\" LCD", "Author": "John Philips", "ReviewID": "R1SAEKUP7U6EXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just set up last night so I don't know about longevity. But watching TV last night I was very pleased with all aspects of this unit. Channel surfing was not an issue. I'm running off of cable and the set pulls in a number of digital channels that are an added bonus. I tried the DVD and found the picture to be outstanding and really didn't hear the noise that has been mentioned by others. The set has many of the technical advantages (ATSC tuner, 1080i picture) that more expensive sets have and  at a lower cost. Perfect for a smaller bedroom.", "Date": "January 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "not worth buying", "Author": "Jeffrey D. Byers \"JByers\"", "ReviewID": "RYZMKJZGIB7LP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought one and got it home only to find out the built in DVD player wouldn't load DVDs.  Took it back to store and got another one.  The remote did not fully work on the new one but kept it anyway.  My mistake. After three months the DVD player kept a rental DVD and will not eject it.  Mintek said to ship it to them and they will fix in 4-6 weeks.  Unit will not even switch to TV mode with DVD player hung up so we can't even use as a TV.Avoid this unit (and I suspect all Mintek products).", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Mintek is \"out of business", "Author": "L. Erickson", "ReviewID": "RQUP10LPBCWMA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Mintek is currently \"out of business.\"  I  have had three (2 were replacements) of Mintek's TV/DVD combo and experienced the same DVD problems (disc sticks/ stalls out) in all of them/  Yhere has to be a basic design flaw.  Now the company has apparently gone out of business.  Not too difficult to understand why.  DO NOT BUY", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very poor video controls for aspect ratio", "Author": "VC Geezer", "ReviewID": "R2DLZ72R0TPC5I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Upon first receiving this product, the video and sound were good. Immediately noticed that their manual was poorly written and did not explain some of the controls at all. There appeared to be only 2 aspect ratio settings: the normal 4:3 and too wide.After about 2 months, finally got around to playing a 4:3 aspect DVD and found that the display is stretched horizontally, resulting in fat people. None of the controls will do anything to fix the aspect ratio - the zoom only makes the images bigger.Sent a message regarding these issues to Mintek's tech support 2 months ago with no reply.Conclusion: the hardware is okay but the software and documentation are very poor. Mintek has a long way to go before they will have a quality product.  I seriously doubt that I will ever buy any Mintek product ever again.", "Date": "February 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "I wish I had bought a different one.", "Author": "J.

Customer service will fix it if we pay to ship it to and back thier service person.  So we will just buy a DVD player because it would cost more to ship.  I would definately not reccomend. The TV still works.", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great LCD for Bedroom Viewing", "Author": "D.J.

The picture was just not that sharp or bright compared to the Sony...it was dull to watch.Sound:  The sound on the Mintek is incredibly bad...my 13\" old TV has better sound.  The sound is very \"tinny\" and weak and detracted from enjoying TV show (especially MTV).Built-In DVD:  The Mintek built-in DVD player takes very long to load and makes all kinds of weird noises.  When the movie finally did play the picture was very good/sharp so I'll give them credit for that.  But later on it was again difficult and lengthy to switch back over from TV to DVD.I fiddled around with the Mintek throughout the day but was unable to make any improvements on my issues.Conclusion:  I'm packing up the Mintek and returning it to the store this week.  I'm going to spend the extra money and get a brand with higher end quality/performance (probably the Panasonic or Sony 26\").  The biggest eye opener for me was comparing the Mintek side-by-side with my older Sony...no comparison and makes me appreciate the Sony more.I gave the Mintek 2 stars instead of 1 star since it was the lowest price TV so you can't have too unrealistic of expectations.", "Date": "February 3, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.95", "Features": "26\" 16:9 Widescreen LCD-TV PANEL\nBuilt-in HDTV tuner(ATSC & Clear QAM) - Built-in DVD w/1080i Up-Conversion Video\nSupport Resolutions: 1080i/720p/480p/480i - Digital Comb Filter\n4 Color Temperature Settings: (Normal, Cool, Warm, User-Define)\nTerminal Inputs: HDMI, DVI, Component, Composite, S-Video, RF", "Name": "Mintek DTV-265-D 26\" 16:9 Widescreen LCD-TV PANEL w/ Built-in HDTV tuner", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ynROka%2BuL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000M15WTG"}}
