I do not recommend. Sending back the same week I ordered it. I need a basic flat screen with no extras! Shipping and returning was a good experience though. Kudos to amazon for the prompt delivery and pick up of the item.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best TV I have ever had!!!", "Author": "Shannyn Michele", "ReviewID": "R1GW5XF6Z7FH56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do not own this particular TV... but I do own a Vizio 32\" Smart TV.  I purchased my Vizio over over a year ago; I bought it before the SMART TV's came out.  I was surprised that it had Internet Hook-Up.  It wasn't until a few months later that they came out with SMART TV's!!  That is when I realised that I had a SMART TV with my 32\" Vizio!!!  I love it.  The picture is great... the app's that I can download on the tv are amazing. (I can play, \"darts,\" on my television).  I just wanted to let everyone out there know that  Vizio televison's are AMAZING. They are worth the price... and they work wonderfully with the color, the sound, the internet, all of the television.  10 stars for Vizio televisions!!!-Shannon", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Deal, Very Happy!!", "Author": "Danielle A.
