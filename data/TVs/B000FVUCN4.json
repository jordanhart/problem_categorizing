The Phillips comes very well packaged so it won't get wrecked on your way home. It weighs a little over a hundred pounds, but I set it up myself, even though it was a little heavy. Once out of the box you connect a metal stand that is very sturdy.The setup starts automatically when you first power it up. I have it connected to a hd cable box that also records. The first issue that you should know is that if you have a hdmi cable, you have to go into the settings of the hd box and enable the sound to hdmi, or it won't have sound. Pretty easy to set up, I did call the Phillips support with a few questions and I did not have to wait long, the guy was forein but helpful. Hows the picture? The regular channels are okay, the hd channels are very clear and shart with vibrant colors and no distortion. I have it hooked up to a two year old dvd, tape combo with progresive scan, and the dvd movies look great. I recomend this plasma.", "Date": "October 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice TV when I have it", "Author": "superyman \"superyman\"", "ReviewID": "RDV40NG5UYPFJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the tv on 9/9/06. The picture and sound are great, however the image started blinking. Philips is covering the repair at an authorized repair center. They have had the TV for over one month now. Philips will not extend my warranty even though I have gone more than a month with out the tv. Philips repair company give you no preference. So if you buy one hope it does not blow because it takes a large amount of time to fix. Buyer beware. 10/14/06 still no set.", "Date": "November 15, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Built in ATSC Quam tuner\nPixel Plus for increased resolution\nHDMI and 2 HD-CVI inputs\nUSB connect for picture and music\nSide AV and Headphone output", "Name": "Philips 42PF5321D 42-Inch Plasma HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31B1CRJ9Q7L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000FVUCN4"}}
