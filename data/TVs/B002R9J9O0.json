{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV with excellent picture and sound quality", "Author": "Andrew Mann", "ReviewID": "R1P9LYBTP4TJM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I may be a little biased since both of the HDTVs I own now are LG, but in my opinion the 32LF11 is an excellent high-def television.  The other LG I own is a 47\" and I am not sure of the exact model, it's 2 years old, but it is \"full HD\" (1080p).  We are using the 32LF11 as the TV for our living room, while the bigger one is in the game room.  When I first received the 32LF11 I hooked up my HD DirecTV signal to it, while I used the built in digital tuner in the other TV to receive an over-the-air HD signal.  Both pictures were excellent, but I had to admit to my wife, who will primarily be watching the new 32LF11, that I almost prefer that picture over the one in the game room.  It is an excellent crisp picture, and I didn't have any problems with the black levels.  The sound was very good as well, about as much as you can expect from built-in speakers on a 32\".  It has 2 HDMI inputs, and I hooked up a few electronics to test out the quality, and my HD camcorder (Creative Vado) looked much better on the 32LF11 than the 47\" LG.  I have to believe that is partly because of this TVs size, but it is still worth noting that it produced a better picture quality when replaying HD videos I had captured.  I'm not sure I would recommend this size TV for a large room, although I was sitting about 8-10 feet away from the TV and had no complaints about the size (and I'm used to watching a 47\").  I definitely recommend this TV for those looking for an HDTV to go in a smaller room with a relatively short viewing distance.  I will also be using this as a monitor and for gaming consoles, which when tested worked great for both applications.  The energy saver feature is an interesting concept as well, and may be worth looking into if you feel passionate about energy conservation.  I can't speak intelligently about that feature since I haven't educated myself on it yet, but it seems like a interesting idea.  Overall, I think this TV is very good and very functional with its size and great picture.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002R9J9O0"}}
