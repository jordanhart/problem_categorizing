I use mine as a TV and PC monitor and I am total impressed!!! Great Picture, great sound and all the input and output ports you need to hook it up in any configuration. I really can't say enough... AND all of this for much less than 300.00 dollars for a 40\" HDTV... There really is no comparison for affordability and quality, because it comes with a 2 year warranty. If your rich buy a samsung, if you want a great, big HDTV at a price you can afford, BUY A TCL!!!!!!! You will be blown away, I have had mine about 7 months now and haven't had 1 problem.....Thank you TCL, if not for you guys, I would have had to settle for a much smaller unit...Marlyn", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$219.99", "Features": "TCL TruColor for enhanced picture quality\nBrilliant 720p High Definition Picture\n2 x HDMI Inputs", "Name": "TCL LE32HDF3010 32-Inch 720p 60Hz LCD TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wzpXVB3tL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CNR1F9I"}}
