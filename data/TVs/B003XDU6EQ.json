{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Honest review from long time Amazon Vine Reviewer", "Author": "All Powerful Wizard Of Oz", "ReviewID": "R1BUQLDHRDR1YF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been wanting to make the leap to 3D ever since I heard 3D would become available to the public for home use on HDTVs. Having priced a few out I just did not feel it was worth the jump quite yet. Then I came across this TV on Amazon. I did a lot of research finding reviews and reading impressions from various HD forums. Finally I went to Best Buy to try this out for myself and was quite impressed.So after much debate I picked one up with one pair of glasses since it's just me. Got a deal for $969 and that is with tax. Prior to I owned a 47inch 1080p Vizio which I've had for 3 years and was a great set for the price point as well. I can say without a shadow of doubt that even without the 3D feature the picture quality of this TV for Bluray blows away my old 1080p Vizio. Not sure how that is possible since this set is at a lower resolution but there is no fooling my eyes and what I am saying is true. The colors are vivid and the blacks are REAL black. The Vizio which was an LCD always had a white glare from back light issues of the bulbs.Video games look fantastic. My only issue with the set is two things. My PC did look better on the Vizio because it offered a much brighter picture and on the Samsung it's not as bright. Not a deal killer but this should be noted. The other issue is with 3D games only such as Avatar, Pacific Drift 3D and MLB the show the resolution is also meh in 3D mode compared to non 3D games which look banging.I have yet to try out a 3D movie but ordered Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Monster House on Amazon and will edit this review to include impressions of those two true 3D movies.The 2D-3D conversion looks fantastic on Blurays and broadcast TV so that's a win for this set.It's like this, if you REALLY want a 3D set as I did and do not want to spend an arm and a leg as what other sets cost this is your best bet as the technology evolves and improves. If anything you will be getting a fantastic HDTV set for a fraction of what some of the other higher end sets cost and will tide you over until the technology reaches a point of 3D sans glasses which is what I am waiting for. Honestly there is very little difference between this 720p and 1080p models.Great value for what you get.EDIT Review day 2:Just wanted to say that I am just in love with this TV.One example I wanted to share is I recently got the Alien movies on Bluray and had been waiting to watch them until I had this TV in place so I could try out the 2D-3D conversion. Well I can tell you that I am on the 2nd movie Aliens and have the this feature turned on with a depth of 10 so it's peaked out and my god it looks amazing. It's almost as if the movie was filmed in 3D but I realize a lot of that has to do with the way Cameron shot the film so kudos to him for being a visionary back in 1986 because it just rocks. Especially any of the scenes in space the level of depth really brings you in when this feature is turned on. Amazing.Still waiting on my delivery of the Blurays that are True 3D and will post impressions as soon as I get them.Edit Review day 4:Just finished watching Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Without a doubt this TV delivers the real deal with 3D as if you are in the theater. The movie looked great in 3D. Was sharp and the 3D truly pops. I am still blown away however at the 2D-3D conversion for other Bluray movies. I also for the fun of it popped in Star Wars on DVD and yes it works great with that as well.I just cannot praise enough about how awesome this TV is for the price point and have zero regrets about picking one up.Edit Review 1 week later:The TV continues to blow me away with each movie I watch in the 2D-3D conversion. The glasses were the only issue with this set. I got the free pair that came with it. What was happening was that the glasses would lose sync during scenes with high action or a lot of light. What fixed it was taking a small piece of opaque tape and placing it over the sensor on the glasses. Ever since the picture has been perfect. A small irritation that has an easy quick fix but felt I should point it out to any other owners of this set or anyone planning on getting one on how to avoid/fix the issue.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great 2D, 2.5D, and 3D performance for a nice price...", "Author": "Critter_FL", "ReviewID": "R391GED1N8J9OV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been in the market for a new Master Bedroom HDTV since our 30\" HD CRT broke (yay!).  Been following this model (PN50C490) since it was announced recently.  I found a great deal at a local B&M; store the week this was released (2 free pair of 3D glasses included) for the same price as elsewhere.  I've been watching this plasma for over a week, and just love it!We feed it HD service from DirecTV and it looks stunning.  Realistic colors and very dark blacks, no ghosting on sports (it is a plasma after all), and we love the upgrade in the size (30\" to 50\") as viewed from 12-15 feet away in bed.  The 2D picture quality beats the old CRT and even our main DLP set in the family room.  DirecTV has a few 3D channels, so those were demoed immediately.  The X-Games replay looked awesome.  I think most sports are recorded in 720p anyway, so there was no loss of quality on this 720p set.  I was able to watch the football games this weekend in a pseudo 3D upscale (I'm calling it 2.5D).  It certainly did something to the picture, and I liked it.  It really added some depth that made the game more enjoyable to watch.  Not quite as good as a proper 3D broadcast or actually being there in person, but given the little bit of 3D programming available, the 2.5D conversion was pretty impressive and worked on demand.No eye strain noticed when wearing the glasses as I was able to watch 3 hours of football without issue.  Waiting for the PS3 firmware update to try some 3D Blu-rays on this set, but I don't think that there will be any issues in the 720p versus 1080p resolutions.  I'll try to post an update on PS3 3D gaming impressions as well (which Sony limits to 720p anyway).  Overall, I am VERY impressed with the 2D quality of this set.  Love the size improvement for our master bedroom given our viewing distances.  And both 2.5D and 3D viewing was great at 720p.  From what I have seen, there is nothing to worry about this set not being 1080p.  Just pull the trigger, buy it, and enjoy the money you'll be saving over the competition.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best value 3D TV", "Author": "Mohammad Masud Hasan", "ReviewID": "R39V6E41DYNJDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, seeing is believing. Me and my wife both visit Sears and HHGREGG stores multiple times to compare plasma vs. LCD/LED and 720p vs. 1080p. We find that plasma is better than LCD/LED in terms of color and other features for picture quality. The lower brightness of plasma is not an issue since there is not much light in our TV room. (In fact, Samsung PN50C490 plasma has \"Dynamic\" picture mode to view at higher brightness, but we mostly use less bright \"Movie\" picture mode so that it is less stressful to eyes at night.) We both cannot differentiate much between 720p and 1080p plasma TVs, even watching as close as suggested for 3D viewing (e.g., about 7 feet for 50 inch). Moreover, because of plasma's superior color contrast, saturation, accuracy, and frequency, both me and my wife feel better viewing experience in a 720p plasma than in a 1080p (yes!) LCD/LED when we compare those in store display side by side. Therefore, we decide not to spend another $400+ just to get 1080p or LCD/LED. Those who are still confused, please read CNET TV buying guide. \"According to the Imaging Science Foundation, a group that consults for home-theater manufacturers and trains professional video calibrators, the most important aspect of picture quality is contrast ratio the second most important is color saturation, and the third is color accuracy. Resolution comes in fourth, despite being the most-cited HDTV specification.\" Thus, resolution is the feature that we can compromise to save money.Secondly, we think about energy-efficiency. From power specifications available online, we calculate how much energy would be saved if we buy LCD/LED rather than this plasma. We find the purchase price to be paid for LCD/LED is much higher than the energy-cost we would save, even for 10 years! (If you consider 10 years inflation of the extra money you have to pay today for LCD/LED, the difference is even more.) As the 3D technology evolves, I am sure future 3D TVs would be much better than current 3D TVs and I am probably not going to watch the same TV for many years (even if I buy the best 3D TV available now). Therefore, I am saving money buying this plasma, plus getting amazing picture quality. By this time, let 3D LED TVs get mature and cheaper. Remember, currently advertised LED TVs in the market are not actual LED-panel TVs, they are just LCD-panel TVs with LED back-lighting/edge-lighting/local-dimming. Plasma is already matured, we think. For example, the burn-in problem is much reduced in latest plasma TVs. Additionally, Samsung PN50C490 has anti-burn pixel shifting feature, which we set always on.Thirdly, even though PN50C490 does not have internet connectivity, it quickly becomes a non-issue given that I must buy a 3D Bluray player to watch 3D content. Most 3D players (in fact, all Samsung 3D Bluray players) come with internet connectivity! Hence, we do not go for higher-end 3D TV versions (e.g., PN50C7000 or PN50C8000 or other brands) to get internet connectivity within TV. Let our player do the job.Fourthly, we have a kid who has a tendency to throw things! Although we do not expect TVs to endure flying objects, it is good that Plasma screen is tougher than LCD/LED screen (according to a CNET forum). Hence, plasma is a rational choice for us.Last but not least, this Samsung model has 2D to 3D conversion and picture-in-picture (PIP) capabilities.Recently, we have actually watched 3D Christmas Carol and other 2D Bluray movies using a Samsung BDC-5900 player. With our limited experience, we must say Samsung PN50C490 delivers us the best 3D and 2D television amusement we ever had. The TV and accessories together cost below a grand! By the by, we have bought this TV for $807 shipped, no tax, including two glasses in an online deal during the Thanksgiving week of Nov, 2010. We also have bought a BDC-5900 player for $119 and an HDMI cable for $1.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not just a great 3DTV, a great HDTV in general", "Author": "Zhiyong Sun \"Forry\"", "ReviewID": "R1MMNG1KK577LC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything the other reviewers praised about this tv is true to me, I will come back and update my review with more content but thought my experiment with the Media Play function of the tv would be useful for potential buyers of the 2010 boxing day season in Canada (yes in Canada, mine was purchased boxing day from best buy canada).This tv provides several ways to watch HD content other than blu ray disk (like a 720 or 1080 video from a hd camcorder, or a blu ray rip, etc.):1. HTPC connected via the VGA port or HDMI port. I tried the VGA port connected to a PC. The tv display native 1360x768 resolution and the image is clear, sharp, and rich in color. So it's like a PC monitor but lot bigger. HD content played on it looks great. With an HTPC you can play like everything, but the drawback is you have to have two pieces of hardware setup and running and sometime things get complicated and not really suitable for the wife (no offense). Other similar options include the various HD media players on the market such as the boxee box. But again two pieces of hardware.Update: I compared the video quality of the same files (some randome HD content of the HDTV capture, HD camera clips, as well as HD movie rips) between PC-VGA-TV playback and the TV's build in Media Play playback (as detailed below), the TV's media play always result in better quality, clearer, sharper, and more colorful image, better contrast, etc. Apparently when using PC to play the video, it often depends on the software used for the playback, which could be fine tuned but require time and effort; on the other hand the TV's own playback function seems to be optimized already for any formats that it can recognize. Especially for 1080i file (I have tried several, including the 1080i file recorded on my Sanyo FH1 HD camcorder, the TV gives very smooth play back without the interlacing defect, while when played on my computer using VLC, the interlacing effect is very annoying to say the least.2. The Media Play function. I was skeptical about it when purchasing it and thought it's a gimmick (as I have seen in many similar product as a bonus feature). I understand there are a million kinds of video formats and lots of products can only handle very few.The Media Play function of the samsung PN50C490 in reality is much better than I expected. The following is what I have tested. You can refer to the manual for a complete lis of support format but lot of times you really have to try yourself. I tried them on both a 8GB USB drive and a 16GB SD card via USB card reader, both works the same. Update: tried a externally powered usb sata drive with two partitions (both NTFS), the TV recognized both partition as two devices, and allow you to switch between the two. The HD content on each partition played flawlessly. On the manual it's written: USB-HDD is not supported. It's quite confusing but hey, fact is fact. I am definitely going to get a large external hdd just for the TV.===============mp4, avi, mkv: yes. Even subtitles of various sort is supported.Mac's m4v and m4a format, not supported. These are from the itunes. The Media Play can't recognize and display the files. If I change the m4v into the mp4 extension, the file can be played with video but no audio. m4a music file is absolutely no go.Casio digital camera (P505) avi video format: yes.Sanyo FH1 HD camcorder mp4 file (720p and 1080 60i): yes. but 1080 60p file can't be played (unfortunately). I own this camcorder.Panasonic GH1's mts file (AVCHD) and mov file (motion jpeg): they can't be recognized in the media play. However, if you change the mts file into .ts file, and the mov file into .mp4 file, both type can be played flawlessly.Panasonic GH2's mts and mov file: although the codec in these have been revised in the GH2 camera, the above still hold true. Just change the file extension and done. Maybe because the Gh2's 1080 is still 60i so can be supported, as the Sanyo's 1080 60p can't be played.A remark on GH1/GH2's video on the samsung: I don't own the panasonic DC but intend to get the new GH2 that's why I am interested in the video compatibility issue. I downloaded the camera produced original files from some review websites. mts files are 1080 or 720; mov files are 720. I had thought with the 720p resolution of this TV set it can't benefit from an full HD source (the 1080 files) but I was so wrong!All the 1080 clips I played in the Media Play are just clearer and sharper then the 720 clips. I hope potential panasonic gh2 buyers will benefit from my test, as this is one piece of hot new camera on the market right now.===============More about Media Play, Music funtionNow more about the media play's function, not on movie but on music. This is just sounds like a great feature but it's implementation is a complete fail. Yes like movie you can browse to the folder and start to play an mp3 but wait, not like watching a movie where you need the display on (apparently), can you afford to leave a 50' plasma TV on just to listen to music? Of course not. So the logical thinking of me is, go to Eco option of the tv and turn the display off. But nooo, as soon as you hit Menu on the remote, the music play stopped, matter of fact the whole Media Play thing exited. So, the music player there is just useless. Plus, it only plays mp3 anyway and the sound quality wasn't great. So, please forget about it, just so you know.===============More on BluRay playbackI just got an PS3 as my 3d bluray player. Works great for the samsung. The Bluray playing is gorgeous no doubt about that. However, the \"it only does everything\" PS3 can't do half of the video format the Samsung's build in media play function does. And the PS3 can't even support the NTFS format! This again shows how great this little Media Play bonus feature is on the Samsung (just for the video playing of course).===============More on Anynet+Had no idea what this feature was until I saw the tv source discovered the PS3 automatically, and I realized that I can use the tv remote to power on/off the PS3 and control its operation (for this to work you have to connect the ps3 to the tv using hdmi)! So basically the direction button and enter button works to control the bluray/dvd playback on the ps3. Then if you need the extra control options (like to back to top menu, change audio video, subtitle setting, etc.) you hit the Tools button on the Samsung remote, then select the Playstation 3 info. This will bring up the pop up menu of the ps3 (just as if you press the arrow button on your ps3 game controller). Pretty neat. It's a lot of button press but pretty intuitive. Not as convenient as a real PS3 bluray remote, but that's one less remote to operate in the dark when watching a movie. So, my praise on this one too.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fabulous 3D - Great Price!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RQX5HQO93KMHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We upgraded from a 48\" rear-projection TV that was about 8 yrs old to this plasma model.  We checked reviews elsewhere on this model, and figured we'd give it a try.  The price difference between this model with 3D and a similar model without the 3D was about $200, and we wondered if the feature would be worth it.  We purchased from a big-box store with a good return policy so we could try it out.  Our only concerns were that the 3D capability might be a bit gimicky and the novelty would wear off; and that this model is only 720p; not 1080 like most newer models.  Well, we really had nothing to worry about with this TV.  There is no ghosting while watching action onscreen, like some LED/LCD models we'd looked at.  The difference in definition is really not noticeable - the difference between 720 and 1080 is barely noticeable with the human eye, anyway.  We watched several shows in the first few days with the mock 3D feature (a selection on the remote allows the TV to change a regular 2D show into 3D).  The only issue we had was a bit of eyestrain from wearing the glasses for an hour or two.  I have a heavy vision correction; this could be a factor.  Another issue is that we still need to purchase more glasses for the rest of the family - the kids faces are a bit small for the adult sized glasses.  They're also expensive and easily damaged.  Another factor (if you're looking at cost) is that to use the 3D capability for movies, a 3D bluray player should be purchased, which is a bit more costly than a regular bluray.  There are only a few 3D movies available.  3D shows on our cable company aren't available yet.  We're considering switching to DirectTV, which has some 3D content already. We really like the 3D feature on this TV - the novelty hasn't worn off yet and we've been using it over a month.  It really makes the whole TV watching experience more captivating.  The sound quality is great - which was a bonus for us.  We had a problem with glare on our other TV, since it sits in a room with a wall of windows.  This TV has a bit of glare, but not as much as we'd expected.  The ability to swivel on the stand is a huge help in preventing the glare while watching in some parts of the room.  All in all, this is a really good TV at a great price - and the 3D feature just puts it over the top.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Impressed!!", "Author": "ETIZZLE", "ReviewID": "RWIQB00KSEJ1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV at HHGregg for $800 and it included two pairs of glasses.

Sports, movies and television all look fantastic, better than my 1080p Samsung that is about 3 years old.I havent watched a 3D bluray yet but the conversion of regular 2d to 3d is really cool.

After purchasing this television I was a bit skeptical about getting a large ticket item from Amazon.  All my worries were soon put to rest, I ordered this product on Sunday April 24, 2011 and it was in my house by the 28th.  I was a little worried about the delivery process being that I had read mixed reviews on CEVA the freight shipper selected to deliver the television.  Overall my experience with them was great once my TV got into town they called and emailed me informing that I need to call to set-up a delivery.  So I did just that and they gave me a delivery window from 9am to 1pm.  They arrived around 11:30 am then 2 mean carried this unit to the second floor where they unboxed the television and mounted it on the stand.  Then I was asked to sign for the TV and I asked them to plug the unit in so that I could see it worked.  After that I signed and they left I was happy and surprised that they put the TV together.  I then removed my other TV and replaced it with \"Beauty\" yes that's what I named her... My fianc\u00e9 was annoyed about that. I have had this television for about 6 days now May 4th 2011, I have watched movies on the TV and the picture looks great.  I have a subscription to DirecTV and I get full 1080p on this set even though it is listed at a 720p set.  All of my HD content is beautiful and top notch quality. This is my 3rd HDTV but my first plasma screen. I couldn't really go wrong here for the price and the screen size I think I got away with a steal. I paid $678 and no taxes and got free shipping!  I am very happy with the size of this television this set is huge at 50 inches!  I have an Xbox 360 and I have played games on this television and I must say that the picture quality is Amazing but I haven't tried gaming in 3D mode yet.  I have 2 pairs of glasses that I just ordered today on the way, and I will update this post when I try my first at home 3D experience.  I had movie night with the family and I got complements for the set, my mother in law said that I have a movie theatre at home and it was beautiful which made me feel good about my purchase.  The television has a beautiful stainless steel base along with a piano black bezel.  The only complaint I have is with the TV is the glass screen, I have 3 large sized windows in my living room and I find that during the day viewing is not too good. The screen reminds me of a mirror because everything reflects off of it during daytime viewing. I am going to have to invest in some black out curtains in the near future to solve this issue which is no big deal for me. But when watching TV at night the colors are so vibrant and beautiful.  I was watching Nickelodeon and Disney with my daughter and the colors on the cartoons were amazing.  But one thing I did notice is that on specific channels that the channel logos seem to burn onto the screen.  At first I thought that I had ruined the set but after watching other programming for about 10 minutes the screen had cleared up so I am very paranoid with watching channels with logos but 75 percent of channels have logos.  The networks with the transparent logos don't pose a problem at all for the TV.  The TV has 2 Component, 3 HDMI 2 in the back one on the side.  1 USB for streaming outside media and updates, 1 optical out and some other ports.  I think that it's the only drawback of this is that you will have to buy another component to bridge all your wiring if you have a lot of electronic components.  Also when scaling with a computer the resolution is fine but it would be nicer if you could view at a higher resolution. Well I think this will conclude my review!", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung - 50\" Class 720p Plasma 3D HDTV", "Author": "Enrique C \"Enrique C\"", "ReviewID": "R3CKYSFD21PDFX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a research nut so it took me 2 months to finally come to a decision and I decided on this set based on overall price and best bang for my buck. For $799 (at Sears) the set came with two 3D glasses (Samsung SSG-2100AB), which are currently valued at around $150 each. I had $1500 in my budget for a new set and I am glad I waited.Sears had this TV on display with the entire package attached (3D blu-ray, surround sound, etc). The 3D glasses where hidden away so I watched the 3D demo DVD with no glasses until the salesman went to find the glasses. When the salesman arrived I actually had him switch it to 2D before I looked at it in 3D. At first glance in 2D it was a great picture all though the area was very bright. I messed with the remote control for awhile and it was very user friendly. We then went into 3D mode and it was great. I then looked around at all of their other sets under $1500 (mind you I have been doing this for the last two months at stores like Costco, Sam's Club, Best Buy, etc). It was time to make a decision or my wife was going to kill me. I could not justify spending TWICE as much for another TV because I did not see anything in that range that had much better picture quality even with this set being 720p. This includes LED TV's. I am not partial to Plasma either. I have owned two different LCD's (Vizio & Sony) in the last 7 years or so and I have never owned a plasma.When I got home the setup took me not even 10 minutes. This was planned to be placed in a dark area of our house so purchasing a plasma was ok with me knowing that a common complaint of plasmas is the effect of bright lighting in the background can be annoying. I was Wowed by the picture quality and this was even before I received my HD box from Cox Cable. Once we got the HD box and 3D Player I was more than 100% completely satisfied with my decision and purchase. Realistic colors make the picture very realistic and not overboard where people on TV look fake as I have seen on other sets which cost more.I read several reviews about this set before I purchased. The complaints I read where about the sound, the stand and the burn in effect you commonly get in plasmas:Sound - If someone got this TV with bad sound then the need to return it because that is just not the case. The built-in sound system is awesome> I work from home and I stream pandora from my 3D Blu-ray player w/WIFI and it sounds great. TV stations and gaming also sound greatStand - I have not mounted the TV yet and do not plan to until I move. The stand has a stabilizer (spring type thing in it) that keeps it sit upright and very sturdy. I've e tried to tilt it on its side and have applied a good amount of pressure to it and it help up firmly. I have no issues with the stand although I can see how one could think it is flimsy.Burn in - I have not experienced not one episode of burn-in yet. Maybe I am missing it and I have to remind myself to pay attention but I have not experienced any burn in whatsoever.3 HDMI hookups, 1 PC hookup and 1 USB hookup but only one Components hookup, which I already have a Wii hooked up to. I am not an electronics expert but there are still a lot of products that use component hook ups in my opinion so if you are like me you will probably have to be swapping out wires once in awhile unless there are converters available.All and all, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Paid just under $1000 for an entry level 3D TV with (2) 3D glasses and purchased separately a 3D blu-ray player w/built wifi (BD-C6800 model at Costco)for $160. Came in $500 under budget ($1500) and couldn't be happier to have a great looking TV and the extra cash in my pocket.  I read some reviews and complaints here at Amazon about the TV being a 720p and with the pixels. I am not impressed with that argument unless you are comparing a 3D entry level TV like this one to a high end model.  I have 20/20 eyesight after laser eye surgery and have looked at dozens of TV's in the last two months, including the two LCD's I have owned for a few years.  I'm looking at it right now.  This picture is fantastic.4.5 stars only because the set offers only 1 component hook up.  Otherwise it would be a 5.I will update this review once I get some more 3D movies and check out that function in more detail. I have only watched Resident Evil: Afterlife and it was decent but I am looking to watch something like Open Season and Alice in Wonderland which have been given great reviews for 3D quality.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "As good as it gets!

I was in the market for a larger LED 55 to 60 inch for the living room. I went to best buy and reviewed side by side with a 55 samsung led and a sony 60 led. I adjusted the settings on all three and tuned them down equally, the sales guy didnt like this but I did it anyway.This tv more than holds its own. I have a 42 inch Panasonic plasma that was highly rated, this tv blows it out of the water. I thought that the 3d aspect would hurt the 2d performance but it does not. This panel is reflective, but it is glass. This tv is clearly a much higher quality than than the other plain 720 or 1080 plasmas on the market, this tv out performed the plain Panasonic plasma that it sat by.600 hz vs. 120 or 240. You can see the difference,go see for yourself.I feel sorry for all the people who will buy a 1080 lcd this week for a little more money. This tv is special and I am glad I found it, I am not even into 3d.To the negative reviews below, I dont see your issues at all on this tv.One funny thing, I set my sony PS3 output to 720p and if I hit the info on the remote, it is saying 1920x1080 24 frames per second? That cant be right can it?I love the look and stand of the TV, it looks like a $3000 set. Their is a silight twinge of purple on the bottom, which is really not noticeable. Prince would love it!This tv is special for the price, dont pass it up!Update: Ok the media play feature supports ripped blurays dvds and music on an external western digital 2tb drive!!!This is huge for me, as I dont have to buy a wdtv or apple tv player!!

You can convert 3D to 2D and 2D to 3D. Although it says it is 720p,while I play games or when I looked at avatar on blu-ray it displayed in 1080p. I find it weird and thought it was an error but it isn't it actually displays in 1080p. When in goes to 3D the colors become very vivid(just like if you have an regular tv in dynamic) and then it switches to 720p but everything look crisp and very sharp. I was amazed by it due to the fact a plasma was sharper than my LED tv and both have the same contrast ratio of 2,000,000:1. I was playing super star dust in 3D and I notice after I turned the game off I seen a ghost image of the sign still there and became very scared that it was screen burn in. But no need to fear Samsung pixel shift is here!!! The pixels shift every minute or you can set it to what ever you want it set to and every 10min the screen refresh. There is a mode that you can use when your tv is not in use to scan the screen and erase the images..OOOOOOO...The tv is great,have plenty of inputs and the sound is better than most recent tv's. 5 out of 5 from me :D", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "I HATED PLASMA NOW IM IN LOVE", "Author": "JAHman", "ReviewID": "R2Z0YNDSJLDUMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was really skeptical about buying a 3dtv that is this cheap,but it proved me wrong big time.I went to HHGREGG pick this tv up for $600.00 bucks. But first I had the guy display a 3d movie on it and it worked flawlessly. Took it home ,setup is very easy.I had my ps3 so I didn't need to buy 3d blu ray player .Remember,to get the best quality video signal you need a HDMI cable dont ( don't buy in store ,i got a rocketfish hdmi cable right here at amazon for dirt cheap and it works great).I have to admit that I had a little problem actually playing anything in 3d with ps3 .I thought for a sec that I would had to return. Anyone that buys this tv and wants to hook it up to the ps3 ,make sure you reset the display setting .When you do that, you see that the ps3 recognises the tv as 3d. Games look really neat in 3d ,I've tried Black Ops,Wipe Out HD, Super Star Dust HD, and a few videos from the ps3 store and I have to say this is the deal with 3d .I just rented A Christmas Carol 3D and it blew me away.To get the effect for 3d you have to adjust it a little bit .Go into the menu then 3d setting and there is a slider for the 3d .it is usual set to half way which gives you a great sense of depth but slide towards the right and every pops out of the screen. 2D is just as impressive ,the colors are rich ,black is actually black not greyish.Don't be con out by people saying,\" Oh but its not 1080p.\" I was saying the same thing to myself and now really cant tell the difference. Movies looks stunning ,Video Games looks amazing and 3D is a great plus.Audio is ok just like any other TV.I use a surround sound system so I don't really care about the TV speakers.WARNING: As with all plasmas never crank up your settings for the first 100hr of viewing ,because it might be prone to Image retention or Burn in( I did research on this ,you should too). but there are protections on the tv if this were to happen, such as a sliding bar of black and white that wipes the screen of any IR.I personally didn't see any on mines.since the plasma was built last year, it is less likely to have burn ins or IR.Overall, This is the tv to get if you don't want to pay a ridiculous price for 3D. Its flawless just as a regular HDTV and an awesome experience in world of 3D.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommend...one of the BEST pictures you're going to get!", "Author": "Jonathan", "ReviewID": "R3LSJ6SGIYIMIJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all let me say that all the positive reviews are correct!I purchased this same TV from Crutchfield's \"Scratch and Dent\" Dept for $639.00 with free shipping and no tax here in NY. I was not in the market for a TV but when I saw the value for a 3D TV, I could not pass it up.  When I first turned on the TV I was amazed by the picture quality. Immediately this plasma blew away the picture quality from my year old 42\" LG LCD which i paid more for.  Out of the box the image looked very clear and natural. not dark, or over saturated. I have the TV in the living room of my apartment which has 4 windows and the glare was minimal. The sound from the TV is OK which was expected. To hear anything clearly I had to turn the volume ALL the way up. I did not really care because I have a surround sound system which I use anyway.Aside from that, there's really nothing bad about this TV. I have no experience with the 3D aspect yet because I don't have any 3D glasses. I just ordered 2 NXG NX-3DGR for $50 each from Amazon and I chose these instead of the Samsung 3D glasses because of the price and the reviews for them were excellent. Can't wait to try them out when they get here.This is my first plasma and I have to say the experience has been phenomenal, and that's without viewing any 3D content.  This set looks 10 times more expensive than what it is, i love the modern design which goes perfect with my furniture. If you're in the market for a 3D TV and you don't want to spend more than a grand then I HIGHLY recommend this TV. I love Amazon but I suggest you get it from Crutchfield which has it brand new for $800 with free 5 business day shipping and no tax if you live outside of VA and they give you a free 19\" LCD. You can't go wrong with that deal. I really hope this review helped. Thanks for reading.UPDATE: After 2 months I'm still in love with this TV, very impressed with the picture. The 3D content works great when you're watching a 3D Blu-Ray! You really get that \"POP OUT\" effect with certain films. For example, IMAX Under the Sea 3D has certain scenes when you feel like the fishes are in your living room. Most scenes look like you're in a aquarium, however this film does have some noticeable ghosting. It's still a good choice for trying out the 3D aspect for the first time. When you use the 2D-3D effect on regular TV then it's just OK. Certain programs look better than others. For Example, Sports Center looks better than Law and Order because the graphics on the screen. The NXG NX-3DGR work great with this TV! They have a good fit are light weight and are rechargeable, all for $50. I say if you're in the market for some 3D glasses then these are the one. Keep in mind that these are for older 3D TV's not the newer ones that use Bluetooth.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung PN50C490 50-Inch 720p 3d tv", "Author": "ONE PIECE", "ReviewID": "R1BBSXB45L62WO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This 3D tv is great I had it for 5 months already... I have a 3d samsung blu ray player BD-c6900 1080p series.. and the 3d looks absolutely stunning.  Blu rays look awesome as well. The only complain I have is that when viewing a dvd that is 4:3 it looks horrible you get black lines on the side of the tv. However this can easily be fix. My problem is that after your done viewing the dvd and you watch regular cable you will notice the black lines on the side of the tv still while watching regular cable.. It does goes away after a while of watching regular tv or blu ray... it last about 3 to 5 minutes.. I dont watch dvds in 4:3 anymore but there is a setting u can use to fix it on the blu ray...Nonetheless awesome tv for Gaming, Blu rays and 3d blu rays for an affordable price..

The 3D aspect of this TV is stunning with objects popping out almost to your face. That depends on the content you are viewing though. I watched Shrek Forever and a few others and they were fantastic 3D effects. I would highly reommend this TV to anyone that wants a lower priced unit with a high priced ability.

As a housewarming gift, I replaced the TV (almost $800).  Less than 2 weeks later - the same 'hit' was noticed on the TV.  Only this time his son had not been allowed in the TV room (the door was closed and fastened)..The TV room is really the front ENCLOSED porch..

Will need to upgrade to a blue-ray player and get the glasses before we can do that.Wish they had offered a package deal that included the glasses, but long term we may be better off buying them separately as new models of the glasses are coming out all the time and prices should be dropping.We're thrilled with the price (caveat, bought online but not from Amazon and paid $150 less than Amazon's price) and everything else about this tv, with the possible exception of the metallic stand. Would prefer a stand that was not as noticeable.Additional comment: We did purchase a 3D Bluray with Wifi and are thoroughly enjoying downloading Netflix. Still love the picture on this tv!

I kind of expected a better experience with 2D to 3D (I found that it's not worth the trouble of wearing the glasses and looking at a slightly dimmer image for the 3D effect) but the 2D to 3D effect does work.  There isn't that much content on cable right now, and we haven't bought the 3D Blue Ray player yet, but it's nice to know that when 3D TV starts to be really happening, we'll have the 3D TV already.We've watched DVDs on a DVD player.  I bought a new DVD player with an HDMI jack hoping the picture would be better, but actually the picture was *slightly* better using the old component cables than using the HDMI cables, so I took the new DVD player back.  We've also watched HD video from Comcast, after getting an HD package from them and having them install the HD decoder/DVR, and it looks like a million dollars.  I know someone with a Sony LED 46\" TV, and the picture is NOT as good as this one's picture.  The other day I went to someone's house who has a CRT TV that I used to think was state of the art.  Well now it looks pathetic!The bad thing about hhgregg is that they work in teams to sell you crap you don't need beyond the TV.  We bargained (well, THEY bargained with US) to get the 5 year replacement warranty for $150, which I don't think is too bad.  But they sold us a $120 HDMI cable, which, when I got home and did a little checking, seemed idiotic.  I returned the cable (which had been discounted to $80) the next day.  I got a couple of 3' HDMI cables for like $.80 cents plus shipping from Amazon.  Also got a circuit protector that I don't think was worth the money we paid (part of a package, all of which was discounted to make room for the extra warranty) but I don't know if this \"cleans up the signal\" claim is complete hogwash or not.Anyway, the picture looks really good.The remote control is easy to switch back and forth among inputs (VCR, DVD, cable decoder) and I think the sound is great.So we love it, and our visiting relative calls it \"the super TV\".", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great tv at a great price.", "Author": "Christopher Stahl", "ReviewID": "R3M1PILMJPNW8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found this tv fr $850 with two free glasses and have not regretted a single moment.

The only two compllaints I have seen people make about this tv is glare and 720p.  As for glare it's a plasma tv, they are designed to be in a darker room than lcd/led tv's if you do not have a theater room I would invest in some blinds to block the sun.  As for the 720p I have to be standing within 2-3 feet of this tv to see any pixels with my eyes.  Also about 99% of all content is in 720p or 1080i, and this tv wll display 1080i also.  At 50inch you are not going to notice the differnce between a 720p tv and 1080p tv.

He didn't try to help bring it into the house or anything, and then tried to take off before they checked the screen. Luckily they noticed a few cracks in the screen before he left so my husband ran outside and caught him. He grumpily came back in because he said he'd have to check it to see if it was actually cracked. They turned it on and the entire screen was busted. They packaged it back up and sent it with him.

Unfortunately my TV was a discontinued floor model so they could not replace it, but they had no problem with refunding me and made sure that they got all the information from the delivery company so that they could refund my shipping cost as well.

This product has a single glaring problem: Like many HD TVs, it does not actually run at the described resolution. This is NOT a 720p display, it is 1366x768 pixels. This wouldn't be a huge problem except that it does not offer a 1:1 pixel mapping mode. Thus ALL content is always scaled to fit this incorrect \"720p\" resolution. It still looks fairly good for blu-ray movies, but for any other content the picture is so awful it is essentially unusable. For example, even the menus on the PS3 were terrible looking. Every game looked absolutely horrible.On a side note, I hooked it up to my Mac and ran it at 1366x768 pixels and when running at the true resolution of the screen the picture was nothing short of stunning. It was absolutely beautiful, and watching a rented HD movie in iTunes in this mode looked far better than a blu-ray did with the pixel-scaling built into the screen. Why any company would build something with the potential to look so good and then cripple it is beyond me. Don't buy this product unless they release an updated model that offers either a true 720p screen or a 1:1 pixel mapping mode (this is when you get 1280x720 pixels with a small black bar on all sides.
