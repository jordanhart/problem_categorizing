If you get a HD signal, they come in fine. For that you'd enter 5 for standard def. channel 5 and 5-1 for the HD channel 5. Easy.The audio is, well, it's not great but it does allow you to plug in speakers or an AVR if you like. There are also 2 HDMI, component, and compositite video connections.Again, nice little TV for $150. If you want to spend more I'm sure you can get more features but how many features do you want in a 19\" TV?", "Date": "August 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "Muncie Gal", "ReviewID": "RV8IZOLPT45CH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this television at Target a couple of weeks ago for $149.  I bought it to replace an analog set.  The analog set worked well with a converter box but the hum from the box drove me crazy.  I wasn't expecting much and was prepared to return the TV if it wasn't acceptable.  I've been very pleasantly surprised.  I'm able to get local HD stations with rabbit ears, the picture is very good and the sound is also good.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "December 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Brandywine", "Author": "Anna of Harrisonburg \"Anna\"", "ReviewID": "R3G7PLCTKXIKIR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is the second try on purchasing a 19\" TV.  The picture is clear & sharp and the sound is acceptable.  The first one (Sanyo) the sound drove me crazy, very tinny.  There is a menu option that gives us several choices on the clarity of the screen.  We do not have HDTV access.  AB", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "P.

The picture quality was every bit as clear and the color vivid. We are very pleased with it.  We hung it under our cabinets in the kitchen, it looks great!

We have 2 42 inch RCA Brand LCD tvs in the living room, and the Sylvania seems to be more user friendley, seemed to hold the digital reception tremendously. We got so many channels! Also has all neccesary features to set up HDMI or Xbox. I hook my laptop up and stream netflix all the time. The picture quality is great, and it is nice and lightweight. Very easy to mount on the wall,or place on a shelf! If you need a good smaller TV and want a great deal, this is the way to go!", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Quality at Low Price", "Author": "J. Hallock \"Country Music Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R3MFVGRNO4TP8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a quality name brand product at less money than most knock-off products that might not last as long.  Sound is better than I hoped for.  I planned to use the earphone jack to run extra speakers but this was not necessary.  Lots of connection outlets but I just use a digital cable. It has very fine picture and no \"dead\" pixels.  It took a bit of time (15 minutes) to auto select the channels but it has done a great job of reading all the various digital channels that the digital decoder box provides but without needing the digital box converter.  That set up was only needed initially -- now the TV remembers all the presets even when TV is unplugged.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Blue Dot", "Author": "Tom H \"Tom H\"", "ReviewID": "RI887NOO5R8TI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got it for my mom who couldn't see sports scores on her smaller tv.

But afterwards I can honestly say that for what it's worth this is one of the best darn TV's I've ever owned. Picture isn't top of the line but it's still very good and plays Blu-Rays very well. Haven't had any issues in over a year not to mention, the batteries in my remote still work a year later as well! Highly recommend and I have to say that I will be buying from Sylvania again.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT DEAL", "Author": "Angela Jackson", "ReviewID": "R1DKA8UWKW4HR6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE IT.
