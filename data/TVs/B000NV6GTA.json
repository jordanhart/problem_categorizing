In the few weeks that I've had this TV I've tested a lot of its features. I've used the HDMI, USB, component, S-video, composite and antenna inputs, all of which produced good images for their respective formats.I like the design because the high gloss black around the screen looks really cool. It's pretty thin and weighs about 60lbs. The fact that the screen swivels on a stationary base is helpful when you're plugging things into the back. The USB, composite and S-video inputs are all on the side so you don't need to move the screen for things that may be only connected temporarily.The coolest thing about this TV is the USB port. I plugged in a flash drive with some digital camera images and was very impressed by how well they appeared on screen. This TV took my 6-megapixel digital camera images and made them look like I was watching HDTV. After using the USB port for pictures and MP3s, I wondered why it didn't also read video files.The TV has an automatic mode that changes the aspect ratio according to what's on screen. This function can be useful when widescreen HD programs switch to full screen commercials. But this can be annoying when a program has a very dark shot with no light on the extreme sides of the screen. But this automatic function can be turned off, so it's no big deal. This also TV has 1:33, widescreen, zoom and superzoom aspect ratios.It also produces pretty good sound. The HDMI inputs sound noticeably better than the (right/left) stereo inputs. I haven't used the digital coaxial output and I don't think many stereos today have a digital coaxial input.This TV displays high def signals as well as any TV I've seen and I'd definitely recommend buying one of these.", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "sticker nightmare", "Author": "Patrick Sweeney", "ReviewID": "RDWSUOUZVXNCE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i second the notion that philips needs to change labels immediately. i purchased my tv yesterday and i still don't have the gigantic sticker removed from the face of the tv. at this point i don't think i'll ever get it completely off. as far as the actual picture and sound, it's excellent and exactly what we were looking for. but we weren't looking for an unsightly addition to our living room in the process. if you purchase this model, i would recommend that you insist that the retailer or manufacturer remove the label before you take it home.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "What an exceptional television", "Author": "C. Lew", "ReviewID": "R33QHUJKIG3VET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this tv for 2 weeks and am totally satisfied with it. It was simple to set up, had it up and going in less than 15 minutes. Loved the fact that the first time I turned it on, a tutorial came on instantly to set it up. How simple! I purchased mine refurbished at an incredible price, and it came to me like brand new.... not a scratch on it!The blacks on it are exceptional. I use an over the air Philips HD antenna with it and I am amazed with the quality. It looks like every bit of high quality that you see on display sets at high end electronic stores that use 1080p digital feeds to impress.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "OK TV - crummy marketing labels", "Author": "Tom \"toms_1980\"", "ReviewID": "RXLG2DOZCOUGY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV is good for the price. It doesn't have the best specs, but again it fit what I was looking for. However, here's the note I sent to Philips:After assembling the stand and hooking up the TV to all the various inputs and straightening up the mess, I thought \"all I need to do now is remove the label on the TV that has the marketing information\". Unfortunately, the type of label that you use required me to spend the next two hours tediously removing pieces of paper and glue left by the label. In fact, that area of the TV now looks different from the rest of the TV face because of the type of label Philip's uses. I would (maybe) expect that type of cheap label on a $2 jar of pickles, but not on a TV that costs over $1,000. I also got some of the glue mess on the LCD screen, so now I need to figure out a way to get that off without further damaging the TV! What a mess. Can you immediately call 3M and start using labels that come off easily like every other manufacturer? What should have been a neat evening since we only buy TVs every 10-15 years, turned out to be one of aggravation and wishing I had purchased a Sony.Beware!", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Stunning Picture", "Author": "David G. Sass \"David\"", "ReviewID": "ROP6OVN51NUZH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased our Philips 37\" HDTV as a demonstrator model off a Target shelf where it had been operating non-stop for 12 hours a day, every day for two years.  Looking at the wall of HD TV models on display including Sony, Olevia, Magnavox, and others the Philips picture stood out as clearer, sharper, and more vivid.  We've had it for two months now and it continues to provide stunning pictures and decent sound.  An HDMI cable improved the picture only very slightly over standard 3-cable sets (possibly due to mediocre quality of cable provided signal).  Best surprises - easy swivel stand, USB port, side mount inputs.  Biggest disappointment - learning curve to disable automatic picture adjustments which disrupt viewing experience.  This is our second HD TV - vastly superior to our previous Samsung, and I'd buy it again over a comparable Sony Bravia.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "just stopped working- cost for the part to repair $900!", "Author": "S.

No picture, no sound, no nothing.The power light indicator comes one, followed by a pattern or red flashing lights (1-4)that repeats itself.  Of course, the manufacture's warranty was expired.

Sometimes we would turn it on and the picture would flash across the screen, but then the screen would go dark. We would have to turn the TV on several times just to get the picture to stay on. The picture constantly crackled and just wasn't all that great. And, despite not being very heavily used, the TV just gave up one day - no warning or anything.
